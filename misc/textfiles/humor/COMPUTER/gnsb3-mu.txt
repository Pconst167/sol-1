Hi,

As I promised a while ago, I am sending you (the ASCII version of) The
Great Net Spellbook, version 3. I have edited the spells to make them
somewhat more legible (for example: SOME OF THEM WERE COMPLETELY
CAPITALISED, while some of the other spells contained some lines that did not fit on
an 80-line screen, while others contianed much speeling missteaks).

Anyway, with this introduction you will find 15 other files, with the
following subjects and approximate length:

Net Spellbook: List of spells	17217
Net Spellbook: Index		 9420
Net Spellbook: Index-macro	  275
Net Spellbook: Attributions	 4818
Net Spellbook: Cantrips		 6598	8 cantrips
Net Spellbook: Level 1		51317	56 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 2		70447	74 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 3		78800	63 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 4		93141	74 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 5		71821	56 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 6		65943	45 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 7		40775	26 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 8		30171	19 spells
Net Spellbook: Level 9		56885	29 spells
Net Spellbook: Conclusion	  688

These files contain the names of the spells, the names of the people
who posted them, an index to the spells, a macro to print that index
using troff, and the spells themselves, respectively.

You are free to redistribute them, and copy them for your own use, as
long as you do not prevent others to do the same. You may not sell them
for profit. If you distribute them, make sure that you distribute the
entire package as you have received it yourself, especially the list
of contributors, unchanged.

One small note about the files containing the spells: after you've
removed the headers and the .signature, you can just "cat" them into
one large file: all of them end with a ^L (page break).

I will eventually (re)post these spells, whenever I think I have
accumulated enough new ones. I will mark these updates as being another
version. Note that this version (3) contains 450 Magic User spells.

Well, enough rambling for now, get them and enjoy!

Many thanks to cscon113@uoft02.utoledo.edu, who accumulated a lot of
these spells. When he started out, he was going to put each author's
name next to each spell. Then he started getting two and three copies
of the same spell, and decided to just put their names here, so if you
have a question, get in touch with one of these people, not with him
or me.

Note that some of the spells contained in the Great Net Spellbook have
been copyrighted by the author. Permission has been granted by these
authors to copy and freely distribute copies of their work, so long as
no commercial or barter considerations are obtained in exchange for such
copies. All spells are for personal use only. If you distribute these
spells, you must also distribute these copyright conditions and the
names of the authors and editors.

After receiving these spells, I have gone through all of them, edited
them to make the format uniform, and to make them more legible. Note
that I did not change the wordings in any way, except in some obvious
cases of spelling errors. Furthermore, when no level was indicated, I
(or cscon113@uoft02.utoledo.edu) just guessed what level it was to be
in. Also, in those cases where no school, range, area of effect, or the
like was supplied, I made one up.

Game Masters should be sure to check these spells, and make sure they
are right for the way you run your campaign. Some are awfully powerful
but some could use a little more kick, that is for you to decide.

==========

* The following spells were researched by Llewllynn. For those who are
interested, Llewllynn is a high level mage of Lawful Neutral alignment
(hence the Detect Chaos and Protection from Chaos spells). As for
access to druidical spells, he is married to Evaine, a half-elven
druid; as for cleric spells, he helped build the major temple to his
goddess on the world he lives in.

Boudewijn's note: You might not want to use these spells in your own
campaign, since it might disturb the balance between clerics/druids and
magic users.

========================================================================

Cantrips

========================================================================

Compass (Divination)

Range: Special
Components: V
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One glowing arrow, 1" long
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip causes a glowing arrow to appear where indicated by the
caster. It is a light green colour, and points directly north. Will
work underground, as well as on sea, and is not affected by lodestones
(magnets).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Appearing Ink (Alteration) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: V, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip turns a small amount of ink (up to one pint) into water.
The ink remains clear and colourless until it dries, at which time it
reverts to its normal state.  The material component is the ink
itself.

The reverse, Jamye's Disappearing Ink, turns up to a pint of water into
an inky liquid that evaporates like water, leaving no trace when it
dries.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pitch (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip sounds a perfectly-tuned note from out of nowhere. The
note is centered on the caster, and can be heard from a distance of 20
feet. Things that block normal noise (walls, curtains, Silence 15'
Radius, etc.) block this as well.

This spell is useful for tuning instruments "by ear", or with the help
of a Tune cantrip. It is also slightly disturbing to those around the
caster, as any single note would be if held out for two rounds.

To cast this cantrip, the bard must speak out loud the name of the note
he wishes to hear, such as "Middle C", "B Flat", or "Quarter-step above
the first F Sharp above High C".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Silvadel's Magic Feather (Enchantment)

Range: 10'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One feather
Saving Throw: None

This spell simply allows the caster to control a feather. This is very
useful for writing things secretly, or for tickling someone. It is
related to the Unseen servant spell... The material component for this
spell is a feather. It lasts until concentration is broken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stepping Stones (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1/10 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 4 spheres, 1' diameter each
Saving Throw: None

This cantrip creates 4 spheres of force approximately 1' in diameter.
They can be place anywhere within 20' of each other, and last
approximately 1/10 round per level of the caster. Magical combat of
just about any sort will destroy these very useful discs so try not to
use them in combat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tune (Alteration) Reversible

Range: 0
Components: V or M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

With this cantrip, the bard can bring one note of an instrument in tune
with either a hummed note, the equivalent note played by a second
instrument (in which case the component of the spell is that other
instrument, which is obviously not consumed in the casting; what good
would that do?), or the result of a preceding Pitch cantrip (q.v.). The
one note will end up perfectly in tune with the reference note. As many
instruments as are in the area of effect can be brought into tune at
once.

A well-Tuned instrument (with two or more Tuned notes) has the effect
of making the bard's songs more melodious and enjoyable; this has the
game effects of reducing the saving throws of hostile creatures vs. the
bard's mood-altering story telling by 1, as well as making the bard's
morale-boosting song affect the listeners for half again as long (i.e.
one and a half rounds per level) as it usually does.

Too many notes perfectly Tuned on an instrument, however, will have a
negative effect on other bards in the area, who will realise that the
Tuned instrument has been magically altered to sound so perfect. For
each note above one that the instrument has been Tuned, the hostile
bard personally gets a +1 to his saving throw vs. the playing bard's
friendly effects.

Although the Tuning is instantaneous, the effects of the cantrip last
for a while. In perfect conditions (humidity on the low side,
comfortable temperature, no rough handling), the instrument will stay
Tuned for a week.  In less than perfect conditions (typical adventuring
abuse, for example), the instrument will have to be re-Tuned every day.
If the instrument is taken apart for storage, such as flutes or other
woodwinds are, the instrument will have to be re-Tuned every time it is
reassembled.

The reverse of this cantrip, Untune, causes one note of the specified
instrument to become horribly out of tune.  It also has the side effect
of turning the caster's hands a brilliant red for one turn after the
cantrip is cast, unfortunately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Umbrella (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

As with all cantrips this one can be very useful though not very
powerful. It manifests itself as a field of force that resembles an
umbrella. It lasts for up to one hour per level of caster as a maximum
though if the concentration of the caster is broken for more than 1
minute it will fade away. It actually does have some form and is
"worth" 6 hit points though only magical weapons will affect it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vision (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Allows the caster to see things in the distance up to three times
better for the duration of this spell. It will also allow him to see
things more clearly as they appear to be only one third of the distance
from them. It does cause some problems though with trying to see things
close up. The spell duration may be ended at any time.

========================================================================

First Level Spells

========================================================================

Acid Hands (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that the caster's hands eject a corrosive acid. Damage
is one hit point per level of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ahrvar's Forgery (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to perfectly duplicate the any
style of handwriting of which he has a sizable sample. The forgery is
good enough to fool even the closest scrutinisation, although it does
radiate faint magic.

The caster merely casts the spell, and begins writing. His handwriting
will perfectly match that of the sample, for the length of the spell's
duration. Those watching the caster write will believe that the
handwriting on the page is actually that of the caster, unless of
course they witness the casting of the spell, which may make them
rather suspicious. The caster need not be writing the entire duration
of the spell; he is free to stop and resume writing any number of times
within the duration. Also, the caster only needs the handwriting sample
to be copied during the initial casting of the spell.

The material component of this spell is a sample of the handwriting to
be copied (containing an example of every letter in the alphabet to be
used), and a writing instrument.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Acid Stream (Conjuration)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

The spell causes a thin stream of purplish, hissing acid to shoot forth
from the caster's outstretched hand, out to the maximum range of the
spell.  This acid causes 1d4 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 8d4.  The intended target may attempt a save vs.
petrification to dodge the jet of acid (save at -4 if size G, -2 if
size H, -1 if size L, +1 if size S, and +3 if size T), and if
successful the jet of acid will have been avoided, and will continue on
in a straight line out to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the
path of the acid must save as above or be struck by the spell.  The
Acid Stream can affect only one target in any event.  The material
component is a drop of any acid.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Electric Arc (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes an arc of electricity to leap from the caster's
extended fingertip.  This electricity unerringly strikes one target of
the caster's choice, inflicting 1d4 damage, plus one point per level of
the caster (up to a maximum of +12), with no saving throw.  A target in
metal armour or wielding a large, mostly metallic weapon (e.g. any
sword, battle axe) must save vs. spells and, if the save is failed, the
bonus (i.e. per level) damage inflicted by the spell is doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Hunting Hound (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 12 turns + 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell calls a canine creature to be a helper and boon companion to
the spell caster for the duration of the spell.  The type of hound
summoned depends upon the caster's level, but the hound will always
understand verbal commands given it, so long as they are 12 words or
less and relatively simple.  The hound will further also be capable of
tracking as if a ranger of half the level of the summoner, and can hunt
sufficiently well to feed the spell-caster for one day, provided there
is game extant in the caster's area.

The type of hound summoned is as follows:

 1st -  3rd level: jackal
 4th -  7th level: wild dog
 8th - 12th level: wolf
13th +      level: dire wolf

If the caster takes a lower-level hound (or a dire wolf when 18th
level), it will have maximum hit points, be +1 to hit and on damage,
track at +1 level, and can understand even relatively complex commands
of up to 50 words in length.  The material component is a piece of
fresh meat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Sparkle Beam (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1' x 20' x 5' cone
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws upon the power of the Positive Material Plane and
calls forth a ray of golden light.  Anyone in the area of effect of the
spell must save vs. petrification or be blinded for 1 round.  The true
function of this spell, however, is its use against undead, creatures
of the Lower Planes, and those drawing power from the Negative Material
Plane or the Plane of Shadow.  Such creatures suffer 1d4 damage, plus
an additional 1d4 at every even level of the caster (e.g. 4d4 at 8th),
up to a maximum of 8d4.  These creatures may save vs. spells to halve
this damage.  The material component is a bit of crushed sunstone.

Alpha's Starlight (Evocation, Illusion)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level area
Saving Throw: None

This spell illuminates an area as a cloudless outdoor night sky filled
with stars.  This light is pale and wan, and dilutes vision mostly to
black and white.  Full visual acuity is possible only out to a range of
10 yards, but general identification can be made out to 20 yards.

Stationary figures can be made out at 40 yards, and movement detected
out to 80 yards.  Intervening cover will, of course, reduce sighting
distances accordingly.  This light does not interfere with infravision,
and there are ample shadows within the area of effect to hide in.  The
illusionary component of the spell creates the appearance of an actual
starry night sky.  The area of effect is stationary.  The material
component is a piece of black velvet and a few bits of glass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Wall of Darkness (Alteration)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' per level x 10' per level area
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a wall of blackness which cannot
be seen through, even with infravision or ultravision.  It is dispelled
instantly by a light or continual light (q.v.) spell.  It has no
physical existence, and does not hinder nor harm those passing through
it.  It does, however, block the passage of sound from one side to the
other, assuming that the spell is not cast in such a way (such as in a
field of grass) which would otherwise allow sound to move around the
edges of the wall.  The material component is some pitch and soot, or a
lump of coal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Animal (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration See below
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One animal formed per level
Saving Throw: Special

An illusion of one or more small animals can be brought into being by
means of this spell. The animals must be of a sort very familiar to the
magic user, and each can be no larger than a fox, a rabbit, or a
medium hawk. Animals created can be of more than one type. The illusion
is visual and auditory, being much like a specialised form of the
second level magic user spell Improved Phantasmal Force.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Association (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 surfaces
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the forensic wizard must brings two surfaces
into contact with one another. Possibilities include the surface of a
jewel and that of a safe, or the surface of an arrow and that of a
bow. If the two surfaces were ever before adjacent, the spell so
indicates, and if the surfaces were ever directly connected as a single
item, an even stronger reading results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azalldam's Fabricated Bridge (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10 yard per level x 5 yard bridge
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster conjures material from the plane of
shadows and uses it to shape a semi-real bridge. This bridge is 5 yards
wide and is 10 yards long per level of the caster; both ends of the
bridge must rest on solid ground. The bridge will support 100 pounds
per level of the caster; any additional weight will cause it to
collapse. The bridge will normally last for 2 rounds per level of the
caster, but the caster may end the spell with a single word.

The bridge is not an illusion per se, and so cannot be disbelieved; it
may however, be dispelled normally.

The material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of a
bridge; this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cat Spirit (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

The cat form spell grants many of the abilities traditionally
associated with cats, though it does not significantly alter the
features of the recipient. The spell grants a +2 bonus to stealth, as
the recipient's tread will be absolutely quiet for the duration. The
spell also halves all damage taken from falls and allows the recipient
to land on his feet. Finally, it grants the ability to grow claws,
allowing each hand to do 1d3 damage. It does not, however, improve
singing ability. The material component is whiskers from a cat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coloration (Alteration)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level maximum
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a chosen surface to change colour, glow, or both, be
it a section of wall, a box, a sword, or a creature (a saving throw
vs.  magic will negate the effect if the subject is unknowing or
unwilling). Multiple colours can be chosen (up to 256 different colours
and shades). If made to glow, the object will emit light for a range of
five feet. The material component for colour is a small amount of die
or ink of the appropriate colour, and to cause a glow the spell
consumes a bit of phosphor or a glowworm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Comeliness (Illusion/Phantasm) Reversible

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None (Negates)

A comeliness spell will increase a creatures comeliness score (or
decrease it if the reverse is cast) by means of illusion. The change in
points is dependent upon the recipient's present comeliness:

Increase in Comeliness		Decrease in Comeliness
--------------------------	--------------------------
Present		Change in	Present		Change in
Score		Comeliness	Score		Comeliness
--------	----------	----------	----------
up to 06	2 - 8		up to 06	1
07 to 12	2 - 7		06 to 07	1 - 2
13 to 15	1 - 6		08 to 09	1 - 4
16 to 17	1 - 4		10 to 12	1 - 6
18 to 19	1 - 2		13 to 16	2 - 7
20 +		1		17 or more	2 - 8

An unwilling victim receives a saving throw, which, if successful, will
negate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Poisoning (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the forensic wizard can determine if a corpse has been
poisoned. One corpse can be checked each round. The wizard can
determine the means by which the poison was administered and the place
at which it entered the body, and he has a 5% chance per level of being
able to exactly identify the poison.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diminutive Darkness (Alteration)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None (Negates)

This spell is very similar to the first level magic user spell
Darkness (see also the second level magic user spell Darkness). It has
only a 2-foot radius, however. This gives the spell many different
uses.  For example, it can be used to block the light of a torch,
lantern, magic sword, etc. This would prevent all sorts of vision only
within the 2-foot radius, so one could still see about with infravision
or ultravision (or normal vision, if there is another light source). It
can blind a creature as a light spell would without creating light that
could alert others, and also without obscuring the caster's own sight
as would a normal darkness spell (if cast upon a creature or its
possessions carried, the creature gets a saving throw, and if the throw
is made, the darkness appears 5' behind). The spell can cancel a light
spell, but has no effect on continual light or ambient light.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drowse (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the illusion in the victim mind that she or he is
extremely exhausted, and in fact on the verge of collapsing and falling
asleep. There is no saving throw. The victim will suffer a -4 to hit,
-2 on AC, 50% vision and 1/2 her or his normal movement rate for the
full duration of the spell. Spell casters will have a chance of spell
failure equal to 100% - 5% per point of their prime requisite (use
intelligence or wisdom). The spell can be negated by Dispel Illusion or
Dispel Exhaustion (but not by dispel magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electric Blades (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2 blades
Saving Throw: None

This spell must be cast with a metal blade of some sort in each hand.
Both blades then acquire a flickering blue glow.  When a hit by either
blade is scored it causes 1-4 more points of damage of electricity. If
both blades hit the same target in the same round the victim must save
versus petrification or be stunned for one round. Each blade only
shocks once and then is normal again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Finger (Evocation)

Range: 25 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a thin bolt of searing flames shoots forth
from the caster's index finger. This bolt will automatically hit a
single target inflicting 1d10 points of damage, plus 1 point per level
of the caster, up to a maximum of 1d10+10. A successful save vs. spell
reduces this damage by half.  If a save is failed, possessions do not
have to make a save, unless they were targeted specifically by the
spell, in which case the owner suffers no damage, but the object must
save vs. magical fire (at +2) or be destroyed (only one object may be
targeted per casting).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find Water (Divination)

Range: 1 mile, depth 10 feet per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One twig
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell, the diviner grasps two ends of a Y-shaped
twig. The remaining end twists around to point in the direction of the
nearest source of fresh water within the spell range. The branch can
twist but twenty degrees, and then the diviner will feel a tug in the
direction of the water. The diviner can specify a minimum amount of
water to seek (greater than the amount in a human body, for example).
Also, he can restrict the depth at which to seek the water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flash (Evocation)

Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Victims failing their saving throw are blinded for the next round due
to a flash of light that appears in their eyes. All to-hit rolls for
the next two rounds are made at -2 due to spots in their eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frost Hands (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the first level mage spell burning hands
(q.v.), except that ice is ejected. Damage is one hit point per level
of the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frost Touch (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell delivers 1d6 points of damage. In addition to this, you add
1 point of damage for every level above first. Cold based creatures are
immune to this, and fire based creatures take double damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guilda's Treacherous Tripwire (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One tripwire
Saving Throw: Negates

One wire (up to 10' long) can be stretched across a hall, or such.  The
wire becomes camouflaged--undetectable w/o find traps.  The first
creature tO attempt to pass must save vs. wands (add dexterity
defensive adjustment) or be caught when the wire springs free.  The
wire will twine tightly about the ankles of its victim, tripping him.
It must then be tediously untangled (or sawed loose) which will take at
least 30 seconds under ideal conditions.  If hacked loose in combat, it
will take 1 round, and the victim will take 1d4 damage unless an
enchanted blade is used (which will cut without effort).  Note that the
wire is required, but not consumed. The material component is a small
spring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human Torch (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the caster and all his clothing to become engulfed in
flames. These flames do not harm the caster or his equipment but cause
1d4 points of damage to anyone within 5' and an additional 1d6 to
anyone who actually touches him. The flames themselves are only about
as hot as a torch but the surrounding area will feel like a blast
furnace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inaudibility (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell completely masks all sounds made by the recipient: bodily
functions such as breathing and sleeping as well as sounds made by
striking another object (walking, for example). Any object held by the
recipient is likewise silenced. Objects thrown, dropped, or knocked
over by the recipient are not under the effect of the spell, however,
and these may make noise at the ends of their trajectories. An
unwilling victim receives a saving throw against this spell. The
material component is a bit of cotton.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insolence (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes its victims to sound and appear crude, insulting and
arrogant, in all that she or he says or does, to all observers. The
victim, however, will not be aware that anything is amiss. While the
general meaning of whatever is said will be the same, the illusion
causes observers to see and hear a twisted version in which the speaker
is so insolent that all reactions are checked at -50%. Additionally,
such speech might not be tolerated at all in some situations (for
example, automatic dismissal from a king's court, or perhaps even
worse...). Even if the target makes her or his saving throw, the attack
will not be noticed (unless the somatic and verbal gestures of the
caster are seen and recognised).

If an observer has reason to believe that something is amiss, she or he
gains as saving throw if an attempt is made to disbelieve. Such a
saving throw is made at +4 if the fact that it is an illusion has been
communicated. If these saving throws are failed, it still appears
real.

The material component is a bit of dung or spittle, which is wrapped in
the magic user's hand. The hand is then subtly waived at the creature
to be affected. The verbal component is a low guttural sound made in
the throat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Melodramatic Music (Alteration, Conjuration, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One intelligent creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The spell causes the music to be played whenever the victim performs
certain actions; such as entering a room, charging into battle, or
making an announcement. The type of music is determined by the caster.

Material components for this spell are: a miniature golden horn,
mustache wax, a short length of rope, and a lace handkerchief.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kazago's Lock Pick (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 day + 1 day per 5 levels
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the bard to pick locks. The bard's Pick Pockets
percentage roll becomes an Open Locks percentage roll, and the bard is
treated as a thief in this respect for the entire duration of the
spell.

This spell is different from both the second-level Knock spell and the
Unlock cantrip in that it can possibly affect much more than one lock,
and that its effects are far less certain. It is especially useful on
fact-finding missions where the bard is worried about coming across
many locked doors along the way.

The material components for this spell are a set of thieves' picks and
tools, which are not consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last Image (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

When the forensic wizard casts this spell, he sees whatever the
recipient corpse saw at the very instant of death, with the intent of
learning the identity of the murderer, or at least the location of
death. If the recipient was killed by a gaze attack, the wizard suffers
this attack as well, but with a +4 bonus to his saving throw.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lesser Invisible Object (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One object not larger than 3 cube feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes an object to vanish from sight, much like the second
level magic user spell invisibility (which affected only creatures).
The spell lasts only 2 rounds per level of the caster or until the
caster wills it to end. For example, a quiver of arrows or a bow could
be made invisible and carried, and when desired, a moments thought
could make them appear. Note that not even the caster can see the
invisible object, so if she or he is to use it most effectively, it may
be necessary to make it visible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Little Death (Necromancy)

Range: 60'
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d4 + 1 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell may be cast on any living (not golem, undead, etc.) creature
native to the Prime Material plane and with 6+4 or less hit dice. The
victim must save vs. magic at -3 or fall paralysed for 1d4 + 1 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mental Notepad (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: See below
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to store information in the unused
portions of his brain for later recall.

The information thus stored will be available for complete recall as if
the caster was reading the information from a parchment in his hands.

The caster is able to store up to two pages of information in the brain
through the use of this spell.

If at a later time, the caster wishes to add more information, it
change the information that is current in his brain, then the caster
will be required to recast the spell and re-memorise the information
again.

There can only be one spell active in the casters brain at anyone
time.

The material component of this spell is a lead crystal sheet of no less
than 50 GP value which disappears after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor Annoyance (Illusion)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates the illusion (sound and feel) of a mosquito flying
into the victim's ear. The victim will then act appropriately, which
usually means stopping and trying to get the illusionary mosquito out
of his ear, until either a successful saving throw vs. spell is made,
or the spell expires.

The spell takes effect at the beginning of the round after it is cast.
This means that it cannot be used to interrupt a spell, although it can
be used to keep spells from being cast in the round(s) afterward.

The victim gets a saving throw at the time of the casting, and then at
the end of each round thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor Mimicry (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell allows the magic user to make the creature touched to appear
as something else for the duration of the spell. The illusion has
visual and minor auditory (such as crackling of fire, mumbling, etc.,
similar to Improved Phantasmal Force) components only. The form is
chosen by the magic user, and unwilling creatures gain a saving throw.
The illusion can be as small as half the size of the creature masked,
and as large as something that would fit within 1/4 cubic" + 1/4 cubic"
per level. Once the form is taken, it remains almost stationary, with
only minor movement possible; for example, a troll illusion could growl
and make threatening motions but could not walk and attack, and a fire
could dance and crackle but could not spread.  For this reason, objects
are the forms most often chosen. Movement is not possible for the
recipient creature if the spell is to be maintained, as this would
break the spell. If the recipient remains still or nearly still,
however, the spell will last so long as the magic user maintains faint
concentration (spell casting and taking damage break the spell, but
talking and walking do not) and remains within 1" per level of the
location of the recipient (obviously not a problem if the magic user
and the recipient are the same person). If the spell is broken for any
reason, it will last a further 1-3 rounds + 1 round per level of the
caster. The illusion does not follow any movement made by its
recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Murder Weapon (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell can check one weapon per round to determine if
it was used to kill a specific corpse, of whom he has a blood sample. A
"murder weapon" is one which reduced the victim to zero hit points, or
delivered the poison which did so.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Painting (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 12"
Components: V
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 2" high cube
Saving Throw: Negates

By the means of this spell the caster can create an illusion of
whatever he wants, as long as he concentrates and the illusion remains
in the area of effect. It is usually easy to recognise what the
illusion is supposed to be of, but any creature that can do so can also
recognise that it is an illusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Personal Magnetism (Alteration)

Range: 5" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

By means of this spell, a mage is able to endow a single target
creature with a magical field which causes all creatures within the
area of effect (of the same basic species) to be drawn toward the
target creature, much in the say way that metal is attracted to a
lodestone. The spell will affect target creatures of up to 4 + 2 HD. A
saving throw (vs. spells) will totally negate this spell, but the hit
dice of the target creature modify its saving throw in the following
manner:

less than 1 HD: -4 to save,
less than 2 HD: -3 to save,
less than 3 HD: -2 to save,
less than 4 HD: -1 to save,
4 HD or more: normal save.

Creatures that have magical auras are totally immune to this spell.
This includes dragons, cockatrice, etc.

If the spell dweomer successfully affects the target creature it will
then attempt to attract all surrounding creatures of the same species,
causing them to move at their normal movement rate (and locomotion)
toward the target creature. The area of effect is sphere around the
target creature which extends outward 1" per level of the spellcaster,
up to a maximum of a 10" radius. The number of creatures within the
area of effect which the dweomer will attempt to attract is equal to
twice the current level of the spellcaster. The mage is unable to
change this number in any way and may himself be affected by the
dweomer (if of the same species as the target creature) if caught
within the area of effect. For purposes of this spell, hybrids are
considered an individual species, so half-orcs would only attract other
half-orcs, not other orcs and/or humans.

The area of effect is stronger near the target creature and therefore
has more of a chance to attract a being toward the target than at the
outer limits of the sphere. The outer 1" area of the sphere's influence
will always allow creatures to save (vs. spells) against the attraction
normally. But, for every 1" closer the creature(s) is penalised by a
cumulative -1 modifier to its saving throw. Here are examples of a 1st
level, 5th level, and 10th level plus mage casting this spell:

1st level Mage

Range:  1" -0- 1"
Save:   0      0

5th level Mage

Range:  5" 4" 3" 2" 1" -0- 1" 2" 3" 4" 5"
Save:   0 -1 -2 -3 -4     -4 -3 -2 -1  0

10th level Mage

Range: 10" 9" 8" 7" 6" 5" 4" 3" 2" 1" -0- 1" 2" 3" 4" 5" 6" 7" 8" 9" 10"
Save:   0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9     -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0

A successful saving throw against the attraction means that the spell
is unable to attract this creature toward the target creature.

Note that the mage may reduce the size of the area of effect to less
than he is able to affect (in 1" decrements) but the saving throw
modifiers are a product of the size of the area of effect, not the
level of the mage casting the spell. This means that if a 10th level
mage reduces the area of effect to a 1" sphere it would only be able to
affect creatures within 1" of the target creature and they would
receive a normal save, but he will still able to try to attract 20
creatures toward the target whereas the 1st level mage would only be
able to attract 2. Also, remember that the area of effect is three
dimensional, and can affect creatures through any material that does
not shield against magic (e.g., lead). Creatures that are physically
unable to become "stuck" to the target will stick to whatever physical
object is blocking their path, such as walls, floors, doors, etc.

If any creatures become "stuck" to the target creature, it and whatever
is stuck to it become entangled with each other, effectively reducing
their normal movement rate to 0". Creatures being drawn toward the
target are totally unable to attack, but may attack from the mass with
one attack form per round if the attack does not require melee combat
(e.g., breath weapon, gaze, etc.). If the combat form requires physical
contact, a "stuck" creature is only entitled to attack once per round
and only if it is first attacked by someone striking at it while it is
entangled. Attacks on entangled creatures are at +4 to hit, and the
creature(s) are penalised -3 on the return attack. Also, creatures so
entangle lose all armour class bonuses for dexterity.

The material component of this spell is a lodestone of at least 2 GP in
weight. It will disintegrate if the target creature successfully saves
against the spell. Otherwise, it is reusable, and only need be touched
during the casting to act as a focus for the mage.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Protection from Chaos (Abjuration) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to protection from evil (q.v.) except in its
purpose and intent; it keeps out chaotic, as well as summoned or
enchanted creatures. It acts as magical armour on the recipient; the
protection encircles the recipient at a one foot distance, thus
preventing bodily contact by creatures of an enchanted or summoned or
chaotic nature. Summoned animals or monsters are similarly hedged from
the protected being.

Furthermore, any and all attacks launched by chaotic creatures incur a
penalty of -2 from dice rolls to hit the protected creature, and any
saving throws caused by such attacks are made at +2 on the protected
being's dice. This spell can be reversed to become protection from law,
although it still keeps out enchanted or summoned chaotic creatures as
well.

To complete this spell, the mage must trace a 3 feet diameter circle
upon the floor/ground with powdered obsidian for protection from law
and powdered glass for protection from chaos; or in the air using
burning incense or burning dung with respect to law/chaos.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Rain (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

After casting this spell, the wizard will remain dry even if standing
in the midst of a torrent. The caster is protected from splashes and
falling drops, but he is not protected from more concentrated bodies
such as puddles. The water will simply bead and flow down an invisible
field which surrounds the caster and his clothing at a distance of
about one inch. An oiled leather rag is the material component of this
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quantas's Target Bow (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One bow
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any arrows fired from the bow (which may
not be a crossbow) are +2 to hit a specific target. The caster must be
able to see the target, and call his shot. The +2 only affects hits on
the target, not on someone or something that gets in the way.

If the target is in melee, the target gets a +2 to it's size rating
when the DM determines the odds of hitting the target as opposed to
those around it. For example, if firing on a size six giant who is in
melee with a size two elf, there would normally be a one in three
chance to hit the elf. With target bow in effect, the giant would be
raised to size eight, giving only a one in four chance to hit the elf.
Should the arrow go at the elf anyway, it would not get its +2 to hit
(since the giant is the target).

Note that the arrow fired from the target bow is in no way magical. The
material component is a feather from a bird of prey, rubbed against the
bow string.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sand Skin (Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Save: None

By this spell, the caster will cover himself with sand that will repel
damage.  The caster will be able to cover himself with enough sand to
block 8 + 1 per level points of damage.  The type of sand used causes
the body to be slightly shaded to that colour.  The spell lasts until
all the points are used up.  Multiple casting only raises you back to
the maximum of a single casting.

The material components needed are: ground granite, sandstone, or some
other type of fine sand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sangfroid (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell confers immunity to all "nuisance" cantrips and first-level
spells cast upon the bard. In addition, it gives the bard a +4 bonus to
his saving throws vs. nuisance spells of second level or higher.

Nuisance spells are those that do no damage, but are designed to
adversely affect the bard's concentration, train of thought, or senses.
Most Illusion and Charm spells fall into this category, as do
Blindness, Deafness, and such spells that otherwise cause blindness or
deafness.  All three variations of the Annoyance spell (q.v.) are
included as well. There are more such spells, but an exhaustive list
here is unwarranted.

This spell is primarily used while performing, as it keeps outside
events such as hecklers and Taunt spells from interrupting the bard's
performance.

The material component for this spell is a chip of granite.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadows (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0 or 6" (see below)
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: None

This spell has three different potential functions, the choice of which
may be made at the time of casting:

#1: The magic user may cast shadows upon herself or himself, with this
covering giving her or him a chance of hiding in shadows as that for a
thief of equal level. The magic user can take advantage of (or is
penalised by) dexterity and racial adjustments. This form of the spell
is only shadow enhancing, so an effort must still be made to hide. It
can be cast only on the magic user's person (a range of 0 for this
function), and the magic user must remain still and concentrate
faintly to maintain the shadows. This can only be of use where shadows
already exist. If the caster is also a thief, this spell can be used to
either give the chance of hiding as described above or add a 2% per
level (magic user's level) to the character's normal thief chances of
hiding in shadows.

#2: This version causes a number of shadowy forms to dart about up to
6" distant in a 2" square area, until the spell expires. This could be
most distracting, for it appears as though there are humanoid and
possibly animal forms moving about. These shadows cannot exist in
sunlight or a continual light, but could still be seen jumping between
areas of cover.

#3: This version creates the illusion of a number of humanoid forms,
appearing exactly as the undead shadow. Up to 1 form per level can be
made, appearing in a 10' + 1' per level square area. The magic user has
control over each form's actions. While they may look like shadows,
they are completely powerless (with the exception, perhaps, of causing
fear or uncertainty - a normal reaction for one confronted with this
situation). The magic user must maintain concentration, and even then
the maximum duration of 3 rounds per level still applies. If she or he
breaks concentration, the shadows will last 1-2 rounds longer before
fading away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skeleton (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, The necromancer can turn one humanoid corpse into a
skeleton. The skeleton may then be controlled as per animate dead. A
mage may only have in existence through us of this spell one skeleton
per level.  The material component of this spell is a salve that
requires 50 GP and 24 uninterrupted hours to create.

Hit points of the skeleton are determined randomly. Disposing of
skeletons with insufficient hit points is possible, if expensive. When
a skeleton created by this spell is damaged, the damage cannot be
repaired.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Skulkskin (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Similar to the effect of the skulk's renown ability, this spell enables
the recipient to change colour so as to blend with her or his
background; however, unlike the skulk's ability, it changes not only
the skin colour, but the colour of any items worn or carried also. The
chance of successfully hiding depends on the activity of the recipient,
as shown on the following table:

Movement Rate	Chance of Success
--------------	------------------
0 (stationary)	80% + 2% per level
Up to 1"	60% + 2% per level
Up to 3"	40% + 2% per level
Up to 6"	20% + 2% per level
Up to 9"	00% + 2% per level

The recipient may attack without ruining the spell, and will surprise
on a 1-4 in 6 if successfully hidden from view. Once seen, a creature
cannot successfully hide from an observer until first moving out of its
line of sight. Note that chances to detect invisibility (DMG page 60)
apply against this spell. The material component is a bit of skin from
a colour-changing creature (such as a chameleon, troglodyte, skulk,
pseudo-dragon, etc).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Small Fire Ball (Evocation)

Range: 5 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: 1/2

This is similar to a normal Fireball spell with the following
exceptions: only one target is affected (the caster chooses the target
and the Fireball expands until the target is engulfed), damage is 1d4
per caster's level (up to a maximum of 10d4), and exposed items receive
a +2 on their saving throws. The material components for this spell are
a bit of burning incense, and any gem worth at least 5 GP; both are
consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snapshot (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: Sight
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: One page
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard causes an image of whatever he sees, even
thermal images and magical auras, to appear on a sheet of parchment or
vellum (the material component of the spell).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spirit Command (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the mage to command a spirit or extra-planar
creature with a single word. The command can be uttered in a language
the creature can understand (or a language the creator could understand
if it is a summoned spirit). Spirits and creatures with 6 or more hit
dice receive a save; spells save at their caster's level (if the caster
is at least of sixth level).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time of Death (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the forensic wizard to estimate the time of death of
the recipient corpse to within 5% if the corpse has been dead no more
than one day per level of the caster, to within 20% otherwise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tree Swipe (Alteration)

Range: 3" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One fully grown tree
Save: None

By use of this spell, the caster will control a tree branch for the
duration of the spell.  The caster can make the branch wave, attack,
fan a small breeze, etc.  If the branch attacks, it does so as a
fighter of the same level as the caster and will do 2d6 damage.  This
spell works only on full-size trees.

The material components needed are a tree branch, a verbal "smack" and
a swing of the arm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Urlic's Unwholesome Meal (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 portions + 1 portion per level
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is used to disguise existing food or to create a completely
illusionary meal. The illusion will have full visual, thermal, touch
and smell components.

With the former usage, a bland meal can be made to appear in all
respects as a royal feast (or vice versa), and even spoiled food or
poison can seem irresistible. The serving vessels and utensils can also
be disguised. (Spoiled foods will often cause nausea, and as a general
rule, if a save versus poison is failed, a character will be
incapacitated for 3-18 rounds following a 2-16 round onset time. Allow
a 25% or greater chance (depending upon what was eaten) for more
serious poisoning lasting 4-48 hours. Both slow poison and neutralise
poison would be effective in countering these symptoms.) A saving throw
vs. spells is not given until the creature actually begins to consume
the affected meal, and this is made at -4 unless a close examination of
the food is made. If failed, the diner will believe the illusion to be
real, and will have no cause for alarm. If the save is successful, the
creature will see the meal's true form, and will be aware of the
presence of an illusion.

If a complete illusionary meal is consumed, a victim will believe that
his hunger and/or thirst has been satiated, but only for as long as the
spell duration. A saving throw is allowed, being the same as that of
the former application of the spell.

The spell requires the magic user to sprinkle a pinch of gold dust
over the food (or air) where the illusion is to be created.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Werp's Unseen Escape (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a weakened version of the second level magic user spell
invisibility (q.v.) (cf. the second level magic user spell
invisibility). For the chance to detect invisibility (see Dungeon
Master's Guide, page 60), an observer is treated as five levels higher
than actual.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wimbly's Wonderful Web (Conjuration, Evocation)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell, when cast, creates one strand of a very sticky web material
similar to the kind spiders use to wrap up their captured prey. When
the strand hits a creature, it immobilises them for the duration of the
spell. When the spell wears off, the web-like material ceases to be
sticky and the creature can easily escape.

During the spell, the webs require at least a 21 strength or better to
break, or an edged weapon doing at least 2 points of damage per level
of the caster. If this is not done carefully then the entangled
creature takes 3/4 full damage if the would be helper misses the webs
or half damage if he does not. The webs would take 1/4 or 1/2 damage
respectively. The webs could be more easily burned off but the
entrapped creature would take 2-7 damage from the burning webs. The
webs for this case are considered Armour Class 0

In order for the target creature to be hit, the caster attacks as a
monster of equal hit dice. Dexterity bonuses are added to the caster's
roll, if any.

If the spell misses the target creature, then an other creature behind
the target may be hit (the spell travels in a straight line out to its
maximum range or until it hits something).

The material component for this spell is some spider webs which
disappear when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wither (Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell kills all normal vegetation within an area of 100 square
feet per level of the caster, who determines the shape of that area at
the time of casting. Trees receive a saving throw of 11, and special
plants such as treants suffer but 1d6 points of damage. The material
component is acid, sprinkled over the whole area of effect. Casting
time is exclusive of this administration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wizard Glue (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

Wizard Glue will hold one relatively flat surface to another, a mirror
to a wall for example. The strength of the bond is 20 pounds per level
of the wizard, up to 120 pounds. Dispel Magic will end the spell, and a
strength of 10 or greater can break a 20-pound bond. A strength of 12
can break a 40-pound bond, a strength of 14 can break a 60-pound bond,
and so forth. If the item held by the glue is brittle, it may be
shattered in the separation. Honey is the material component of this
spell.

Acid Water (Alteration)

Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One gallon per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns water into an acidic substance. If a creature touches
this stuff, it takes 2d4 damage. If the acid is drunk, it will take 4d4
damage. The caster can do anything in or to the substance without
taking any damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ahrvar's Instant Offensiveness (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell effects any single intelligent being it is cast upon. By
intelligent being, it is meant any creature with a rudimentary form of
spoken language. This includes humans, demi-humans, humanoids,
intelligent monsters, etc.

The victim receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect, with
the appropriate adjustments due to Wisdom. If the victim fails his
save, the victim's speech immediately becomes offensive to all who can
understand the language the victim is using. The victim, however, only
hears what he thinks he is saying, and may become extremely curious as
to why everybody is mad at him. The words of the victim become SO
offensive, in fact, they act as a low-power Taunt spell, with those
hearing and comprehending the victim's speech making a save vs. magic
at +4, or else be consumed with a mindless desire to bash the victim's
head in. Each person within hearing of the victim will hear whatever
would be considered most offensive by them. The caster is the only one
able to hear what is actually spoken by the victim, and is thereby
immune to the taunt effect.

The components of this spell are the command word, and a subtle
pointing motion by the caster, at the target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ahshay's Mystic Mutable Aura (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One object or person
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a magic aura around an object similar to the one
from Nystul's Magic Aura. However, it hides not the magic property, but
the alignment of the target. The caster can specify which alignment he
wants the object to radiate as well as the strength of the radiation.
The higher the level of the caster the more radical alignment he could
place on the object or person. Note that this aura does not change the
alignment (if present) of a person or object.

This spell foils such spells as Detect Good/Evil, a paladins Detect
Evil ability and the spell Know Alignment. It does not change the
effect of the Protection from Good/Evil spells. Note that the priest
version of True Sight or a gem of seeing will see through this spell.
If the object or person acts in a different way than is indicated by
the aura, other people will get a disbelieve check. A mage with the
true sight spell will now get a true reading off a detect evil.

The material component of this spell is a sheet of thin silk in an
appropriate colour to the alignment being cast. It is consumed
completely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Moonlight (Evocation)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an area of soft blue-grey light, apparently coming
downwards from above. This light effectively washes out all colour, but
clear vision is certainly possible within the area of effect. Vision is
also possible out to 10 yards beyond the spell's radius, but such
vision is dim and shadowy at best. The moonlight does not interfere in
any way with infravision, but the nature of the light is such that
creatures adversely affected by bright light suffer only half the
normal penalties when within the Moonlight and none when within its
shadowy fringes. The Moonlight spell may be centered on the caster, in
which case it moves with him. Otherwise, the spell must be cast on an
area and is stationary. The material component of this spell is a
moonstone that has been exposed to actual moonlight for a full night.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rainbow Beam (Evocation)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell draws upon the power of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of
Radiance and brings forth a beam of pure light. The colour of the light
making up the beam is normally randomly determined by a roll of a d8.
However, the caster has a chance equal to 5% per level of being able to
select the colour of the beam (the caster may not select a multi-hued
beam. Such occurs only as the result of an aberration in the magic).
The colours of the beams are as follows:

1	red (cold)		6	indigo (holy water)
2	orange (heat)		7	violet (force)
3	yellow (acid)		8	multi-hued beam -
4	green (poison)			roll twice ignoring 8's
5	blue (electrical)

The beam does a base of 2d6, plus an additional point of damage for
each level of the caster (e.g. a 7th level caster would inflict 9-19
(2d6+7) points of damage). Any creature resistant to the attack form
indicated by the colour of the beam takes NO damage, while a creature
vulnerable to the specific attack form (such as heat vs. a yeti) will
suffer double damage. A saving throw indicates that the beam has
missed and the intended victim is unaffected. Note that the beam may
hit a target other than the one intended. Once the beam hits a solid
object, it stops, even if that object is transparent. Any creature
suffering damage from the spell must make item saving throws if
appropriate. The material component of the spell is a small clear gem
or crystal prism worth at least 50 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Spark Shower (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' x 20' long x 10' base wedge shape
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster extends his arms and speaks the spell, and a sheet of
sizzling purple sparks shoots forth from the caster's hands. These
sparks cause 1d4 electrical damage per three levels of the caster,
rounded up, to a maximum of 5d4. Those wielding metal weapons (swords,
etc.) or wearing partially metal armour (ring, scale, chain) save at -2
and suffer +1 point of damage per die. Those wearing full metal armour
(splint, banded, plate, etc.) save at -4 and suffer double damage. The
material component is a bit of fur, glass, and copper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Star Gaze (Evocation)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a blazing white sheet of light to issue from the
caster's eyes. This sheet will envelop a number of creatures based on
the caster's level. Those who fail a save vs. petrification will be
blinded for a full turn. Those who do save are merely dazzled (-2 on
to hit and AC) for 1 round, having looked away just in time. Dark
dependent creatures such as drow and gray dwarves save at a -4 vs.
this spell, and the duration of its effects are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starblades (Conjuration)

Range: 10' + 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature per 3 levels maximum
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates one magical star-shaped bladed weapon for each three
levels of the caster, up to a maximum of seven. The caster may then
throw these as weapons, out to the spell's maximum range. They are
treated as Slashing weapons with respect to effectiveness vs. armour,
and the caster's to hit rolls with them are at +3, in addition to any
bonus for high dexterity. Each Starblade that strikes causes 2d4
damage, +2 vs. creatures with powers drawing on the negative material
plane or plane of shadow. The material component is a small silver
star.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ambient Light (Alteration)

Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 2" radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is in many ways similar to the first level spell Light
(q.v.). With an Ambient Light spell, while there is a centre for its
sphere of effect, there is no point of light at this centre -- the
intensity of the light is consistent throughout the entire globe. The
light is even behind objects or walls, in a closed chest, in fact,
everywhere in the area of effect. Therefore, absolutely no shadows
exist. The spell has a number of interesting effects because of this;
for example, if cast in a hallway, the light would extend through a
door or wall into an adjacent room (or even into secret tunnels below
the hall) up to the full area of effect. Just beyond the 2" radius
globe, reflected light from the actual area of affect lights up 5'
further. This is much dimmer than the globe, is very shadowy (if there
is something to cast one), and fades off into complete darkness
(assuming, of course, the area would be dark without this spell). One
obvious advantage of the spell is to make hiding in shadows impossible
within the area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Annoyance (Illusion)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This is a more powerful version of the first level spell Minor
Annoyance (q.v.), in that it creates the illusion of a bumblebee flying
into the victim's ear. The victim only gets one saving throw; if
successful, the annoyance lasts for only one round. The spell's effects
start at the beginning of the next round, just like Minor Annoyance.

The material component of this spell is a dead insect. If an actual
dead bumblebee is used, the victim's saving throw is made at -2.

Azalldam's Fabricated Boat (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Azalldam's Fabricated Bridge except it shapes
a boat from the conjured shadows instead of a bridge. The caster may
create a boat of 50 square feet per level (up to a maximum of 1000
square feet). The boat will support 100 pounds per level of the caster;
any additional weight will cause the boat to capsize. The spell will
last 1 turn for each level of the caster, or until the caster ends it.

Similar to the Fabricated Bridge spell, the boat may not be
disbelieved, but may be dispelled.

The material component for this spell is a small wooden carving of a
boat; this carving is not consumed when the spell is cast.

Bigby's Groping Fingers (Conjuration)

Range: 3"
Components: S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to "grope" his target. This spell is
usually used by mischievous apprentices in bars and such... have fun!
(gee, I don't know if I'm hitting a copyright problem by using the name
"Bigby" in here but it just seems the most appropriate name to use, and
for all I care, if TSR wishes to claim this silly spell as their own,
so be it).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Byen's Arrow (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 round per arrow
Area of Effect: One arrow per 2 levels
Saving Throw: None

Several decades past, Byen, the famed assassin/illusionist of the City
of Yorkad, created this spell so as to be able to execute certain
"assassinations" which would seem completely real but in which the
victim would (hopefully) not be killed. Byen's Arrow creates a very
powerful illusion that is modelled exactly after an actual arrow. The
caster must take a real arrow, of fine quality, and spend one entire
round chanting and weaving her or his hands along the edge of the
arrow. To complete the casting, the caster must prick her or his finger
with a splinter of wood and smear it upon the arrowhead. The arrow is
then actually replaced by an illusion, that has full visual, audible,
tactile, thermal, and olfactory components. An attempt to disbelieve
can be made, but the save is made a -2 DM (or +2 if informed of the
illusion); however, in most circumstances, there will be no reason to
suspect anything is amiss. The magic user can "enchant" up to 1 arrow
for every two levels she or he possesses, each arrow taking one round
of preparation.

The arrows must be shot in a normal manner (i.e. the magic user must
have someone of a class able to make use make use of a bow to shoot
them). Such a user will in no way suspect that the arrows are
illusionary from just examining them. If these arrows hit a target, the
illusion continues so that the target will bleed illusionary blood, an
will feel illusionary pain. Unless the victim for some reason attempted
to disbelieve and this attempt was successful, the victim will take the
full 1-6 damage from the arrow, plus any applicable bonuses for
strength, specialisation, a magic bow, etc. Only 25% of this damage is
actual, but even after the illusion fades (which happens in 5 rounds +
1 round per level after being hit) the victim will still suffer form
shock and a loss in confidence and composure. Hit points lost because
of these arrows that were not part of actual damage will be recovered
at a rate of 1 HP per round of rest or 1 HP per turn of even mild
activity, but not at all for strenuous activity. Creatures brought
below zero HP because of this illusionary damage will be unconscious
and must make a system shock survival roll of else die of shock, losing
1 HP per round until reaching -10, unless they receive aid. Even
creatures that can be hit by only by silver, iron or magical weapons
will suffer from all the above effects unless they have some special
resistance to illusions (or have reason to be suspicious and
disbelieve).

Note that Byen's Arrow will work on light and heavy quarrels of high
quality as well as on arrows.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cause of Death (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

With this spell the forensic wizard can determine if the corpse has
received damage from any of the causes listed in the table below, and
which cause actually reduced him to zero hit points. This spell
involves dissection of the corpse, and the material components are a
magnifying glass and a set of scalpels. These are not expended by the
casting.

Cause			Notes and secondary information
------------------	--------------------------------------------
Exposure		exposure to cold, fire, heat, or lightning;
			drowning
Falling or hanging	height fallen from
Disease or old age	organs affected, parasites involved
Magic			applies only to magic missile or necromantic
			effects
Wound			wound inflicted by bludgeoning, piercing, or
			slashing

The DM may introduce a chance of failure if the body is greatly
decomposed, and he might give false information based on nature of the
trauma. A corpse swatted by a dragon's tail, for example, might show
the same indications as one which fell from a great height, and a
poisoned corpse usually looks like one which died of disease. The
prudent forensic wizard always detects poison just to be sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cheffield's Major Feast (Alteration)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: 4 people fed per level
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast into a large pot or onto an appropriate number
of plates it brings into being enough food to feed four per level of
the caster for one meal. The food is nourishing and filling, the drink
is cool and refreshing. The food may not taste the best in the world
but it certainly fills the cracks. It also makes, when chilled and
rewarmed, exceptional leftovers.

This spell requires a handful of rice which is cooked over a low boil
while the caster mutters "cooks in just 5 minutes."

The spell was created by a magic user whose abilities as a chef far
surpassed those of his spell casting. He is known far and wide as a
chef of great skill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Circle of Power (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell allows a group of mages to work in conjunction to
create a special area of effect (the circle) into which one mage (or
possibly two) may enter and have their working level of experience
increased. A minimum of four mages is required to initiate the spell,
and the spell must be cast by the mages of the circle, not read or used
from any device.

First, the mages form a circle and begin casting the spell. The spells
from each mage must then synchronise into a rhythmic chanting effect.
This means that it will take as many rounds as the highest level member
of the circle to make the circle synchronise and become operative. From
that point on, a mage may enter the circle and have his working level
of experience increased by the total combined levels of the circle
spellcasters minus one level for each member of the circle. Once
entered, the central mage may rest and study as a higher level mage,
but may not use new spell levels, just the higher memorisation
capabilities, spell range, duration increases, etc. If the total number
of levels bestowed reaches 20, another mage may step into the circle
and divide the increased level benefits between himself and the first
mage with all odd remaining levels becoming useless and therefore
ignored.

Any members of the circle who are injured immediately fall away from
the circle's synchronisation and the central mage(s) lose(s) the
benefits of that member's levels one turn later. New mages may join
into the circle at any time (taking an equal number of rounds as their
experience level to synchronise with the circle), though, and since the
effects of being in a circle will not wear off for one full turn other
circles may be formed which the mage may enter to retain his current
working level (or increase of decrease it according to the levels of
the new circle).

Members of the circle may chant (from the synchronisation point) for a
period of turns equal to the combination of their intelligence and
constitution scores divided by two and then added to their current
experience level. The circle members (but not the central mages) gain a
magic resistance to any attacks against the circle which would silence
the spell equal to the total experience levels of the circle members.

The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloud Walk (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creatures touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the recipient to walk on any form of fog, cloud, or
smoke as if it were solid. The recipient may move at normal movement
rate, plus the movement rate of the smoke (thus a rising column of
smoke from a fire might carry the recipient up at 12 movement rate).
The smoke must be reasonably thick, reducing visibility
significantly... This spell will not allow walking on fine mist. The
material component is a hair from a nightmare.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dancing Fire Light (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Save: 1/2

This spell - except as noted - is the same as Dancing Light (out of
TSR's Player's Handbook). The lights are orange-like in colour and give
off heat. If the caster concentrates on the balls, he can have them
attack doing 1-3 points of damage per ball (4 balls maximum). All the
balls must attack the same target in any given round. Optionally, the
caster can form one mass that looks like a fire elemental and can
attack once per round and does 3-9 points of damage. The heat can set
fire to flammables.

The material components needed are a piece of flint and either a bit of
phosphorus or withwood.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Armour (Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

While this spell is in effect, any creature who touches the caster with
exposed flesh (to cast a spell, for example) will suffer 1d8 points of
damage. The spell will not protect the necromancer from damage, nor
does it have any effect on an armed opponent, but it will affect
undead, and the death master adds one point to damage inflicted with
his bare hands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Chaos (Divination) Reversible

Range: 6"
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1" wide path
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar in all respects to the second level mage spell
Detect Evil/Good (q.v.), except that the mage is detecting for
Chaos/Law.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Magic II (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 6" + 2" per level path, 2" wide
Save: None

This spell is just like TSR's Detect Magic spell except it is more
sensitive, has a longer range (6"+1" per level for the TSR version),
and the caster will be able to determine accurately what kind of magic
(alteration, divination, conjuration, etc.) is in effect if the magic
is within 6" + 1" per level. This spell will not blind, hurt, or ...
someone if in an area of extreme magic, the caster will simply know
that stronger magic is in effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Phase (Divination)

Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster can see and perceive any creature
that is out of or in a different phase than that of the caster. This
means that the caster will see clearly such creatures with special
defenses as displacement, blinking, duo-dimension, astral, or
etherealness and those who can shift out of phase, such as a phase
spider. Furthermore, if the caster has means to attack such creatures,
he will have none of the ill effects that normally occur when trying to
attack (i.e. the caster would know the exact location of a displacer
beast, or where the phase spider is etc.). The information cannot be
communicated to his fellows by words.

The material component of this spell requires a lens of calcite crystal
which must be viewed through for the spell to have effect. It does not
disappear at the end of the spell.

Some Mages have made spectacles of calcite crystal so they would have
there hands free to do other things after casting the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Spirit (Divination) Reversible

Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: None

Detects the presence of a soul spirit or mentality in any body or
object (enchanted swords, etc.), and whether or not the mind
controlling the body is its "native". Thus, it will not detect charming
or hypnosis but will detect possession. Only the fact of a mind is
detected, not its nature. If it is cast on a normally invisible spirit
(such as an Invisible Stalker or Unseen Servant), the caster can see
the creature as a visible force for one turn per level. The reverse,
Obscure Spirit, has a range of touch and conceals a single mind or
spirit from detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disease (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Similar to spells such as Blindness and Deafness, a Disease spell will
cause its target to believe that she or he has contracted a real
(natural) disease. Even though the spell affects the mind, the victim
believes so strongly in the disease that boils, pains and any other
symptoms normally associated with the affliction will be imagined,
putting the individuals health under considerable stress.

If the target has recently been in a situation where contracting a
disease is quite likely (such as living in filthy surroundings, falling
into sewage or garbage heaps, attacks from giant rats or oygtugs,
etc.), a saving throw is made at a penalty of -4; on the other hand, if
a character has recently had a Cure Disease cast upon herself or
himself, is immune to normal diseases, or has some other strong reason
to believe that she or he could not possibly have contracted a disease,
then a saving throw at +4 or higher (probably +8 if normally immune) is
allowed.

Once the spell takes effect, it is permanent until the inflicted
receives a Dispel Illusion. The disease is determined randomly from
the table in the DMG, with the full effects described inflicting the
target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dispel Silence (Abjuration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell automatically dispels any magical silence within
its area of effect. Furthermore, no silence spell will have effect
within the area of effect for the duration of the spell.

The casting of this spell requires a small silver bell, chime, or gong,
which must be struck twice, at the end of each segment of casting. The
device must be worth at least 50 GP, and is consumed in the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Explosive Missile (Alteration/Evocation)

Range: 0"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell actually has two variations. The first produces a special
dart which the magic-user hurls toward its target. The dart has a +3
"to hit" bonus at 10' or less, +2 at 20', and +1 at 30'. A successful
hit does 3-6 damage points +1 hit point per caster's hit die. The
second version enchants an ordinary arrow or quarrel, making it magical
for hitting purposes, and delivering double normal damage +1 hit point
per caster's level.

Both versions also have a residual blast radius, inflicting 2d4 damage,
or 1d4 on a save vs. magic. Any item struck directly by an explosive
missile must save vs. crushing blow to avoid damage. The material
components are sulfur, diamond dust, and the appropriate missile being
enchanted. The first version requires a 10 GP silver dart as it's
missile. The explosive missile must be used within three rounds of
creation, otherwise it detonates and does damage to those immediately
around it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's War Disk (Evocation)

Range: 6"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The war disk is a small hand hurled missile which the magic-user throws
toward its target. It's "to hit" bonus is +3 at less than 2", +2 from
2" - 4", and +1 from 4" - 6". The caster must declare which version he
is casting prior to the throw. The first type hits only once for 1d4
base damage + 1 hit point per level of the caster. The second may be
thrown once per round for 1d4 + 1 point of damage per successful hit
and automatically returns at the end of the round. Its duration is one
round per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duck! (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 (but takes up the entire round - see below)
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the caster helps the defence out on himself or another
creature. If the caster sees an attack coming, the caster can cause
the creature to be suddenly moved out of the way so as to cause the
attack to miss. This will only work against body (claws, bit, etc.)
or hand held weapons. The creature that has been moved must then take
5 segments readjusting his position before it can attack again.

The caster must prepare for this spell, and must declare at the end of
the previous round that he is casting this spell. The caster then
waits until the monster attacks, and throws the spell.

Creatures that have never had this done to them before must make a save
vs. petrification or be stunned for 2 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dumbness (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes the recipient creature to become completely dumb,
believing that she or he is unable to speak by means of voice in any
way (cf. Blindness, Deafness). This effect can only be removed by
Dispel Illusion, or by the will of the caster, and is permanent until
such time. The victim does get a saving throw verses spell to avoid the
effect. Note: this spell could be very effective against creatures such
as androsphinxes, dragonnes and harpies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dust Warriors (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" long square
Saving Throw: None

The material component for this spell is a full set of teeth from a
man-sized or larger carnivore which must be cast on an area of earth,
rock, raw stone, sand or gravel as the spell is cast. The spell
generates 1 skeleton + 1 per 2 levels which rise from the area. They
will fight for the caster until they are turned or destroyed, the
caster is slain, rendered unconscious or moves out of spell range of
the group, or the magic is dispelled. They last only while there is
someone to attack (including each other, if necessary) - any round in
which there are no targets available the skeletons will fade back into
dust.

If dragon's teeth are used as the material component, each skeleton
will have bonus hit points equal to the age category of the dragon
(count 4 HP = 1 HD for turning and attack purposes). Furthermore, they
will be immune to the attack type of the dragon's breath weapon. [ed.
note: we use second edition, so dragon's teeth aren't too easy to come
by]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expose Magic (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell will inform the caster of all of the details of a single
spell cast within one round per level - including the destination of a
teleport, the target of a charm spell, the name of a spell without
obvious effect, etc. The spell does not invalidate illusion magic - the
spell will return an answer consistent with the illusion (i.e. that a
Fireball was cast rather than a Spectral Forces) unless the caster has
already disbelieved successfully.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exterminate II (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None or special

Exterminate negates Call Insect, protects one person against Insect
Plague, and gives +6 on saves vs. Summon Insects. Dispel Magic requires
a mage of twice the caster's level. Magic resistance applies only to
the creature touched.

To negate this spell, both victim and insects have to make their saves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flamehand (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When cast, this spell causes the caster's hands to glow with a soft red
light; if the caster scores a hit in combat, his hand will discharge a
sheet of flames that will engulf the target. The victim suffers damage
equal to 1d10 + 1 per level of the caster (a successful save vs. spell
reduces the damage by one half). This spell may be used twice per
casting (once for each hand); both charges must be used within 5 rounds
plus 1 round per two levels of the caster; after this time, any
remaining charges are lost. Two attacks may not be made in the same
round unless the wizard is normally capable of doing so; in this case,
two separate "to hit" rolls must be made, and each suffers a -2
penalty.

The flames from this spell will ignite any combustible material; these
flames may be extinguished the following round, if no other action is
taken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greysky's Improved Missile (Evocation)

Range: 2" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One or more creatures
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as the first level magic user spell
magic missile except for two changes: (1) the area of effect - everyone
in spell range could possibly be hit with 1 or more missiles - and (2)
the number of missiles that can be fired by the caster - for every 3
levels of experience, the caster can fire two magic missiles (i.e.
level 1-3: 2 missiles, level 4-6: 4 missiles, level 7-9: 6 missiles,
etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Guilda's Sneakabout Light (Alteration)

Range: 5'
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Creates a dim, floating light of variable intensity that follows the
caster. At its brightest, it is enough to read with good eyesight, and
it can be extinguished and restored at will during the duration. No
light produced by the spell escapes the 5' radius, preventing the caster
from being given away by his light--so this spell is ideal for
thieves. Note that background light penetrates the area of effect
freely, so the caster is in no way concealed by this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hand of Ithiqua (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

A target of the Hand of Ithiqua, failing to save vs. magic will be
pinned to the ground by an invisible force. The force is illusionary,
but will seem completely real to the victim, so that she or he will be
unable to move. The victim will be pinned to the ground at a location
of the magic user's choice, and despite any struggling will have a
movement of 0 regardless of strength. The subject will be very prone,
+4 to be hit (with no AC adjustment for dexterity) and -4 to attack.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heat Feet (Alteration)

Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes the affected creatures' footgear to become very hot,
blistering the victim's feet. Because of this, the target fights with a
-2 to hit, a +2 penalty to it's armour class, loses any dexterity
bonuses, and moves at 5/6 of it's normal speed. The reduction in
movement rate lasts until the blisters have healed. Creatures that are
immune to fire don't suffer any of these effects. Flammable footgear
must save vs. normal fire or be ruined; footgear that saves is merely a
bit charred.

Alternatively, this spell can be used to counter the effects of natural
cold. In this mode, the spell will keep the affected creatures' feet
comfortably warm for 1 turn per level of the caster, even in snow or
ice.

The material components for this spell are 2 leaves of stinging nettle
and, of course, footgear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Imitation (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar in nature to Change Self (q.v.), but allows the
magic user to assume the form of a specific creature. There is,
however, a chance that the form will not be accurately imitated, with
some inconsistency or fault being noticed by the observer(s). The
chance of an observer detecting this ruse is as follows:

Observers Familiarity	Base Chance of	Modifier for
With Assumed Form	Detection	Caster's Familiarity
---------------------	--------------	--------------------
Very well known		25 %		- 5 %
Seen often		15 %		+ 0 %
Seen occasionally	10 %		+10 %
Seen once		5 %		+20 %
Never seen		0 % *		Not applicable

* This is also the chance of a creature recognising a non-specific form
as a false one.

Additional Modifiers:
+ 5% per level of the viewer
- 5% per level of the magic user
+20% if listener attempts to determine authenticity
+10% if only seen occasionally
+ 5% if seen once or never seen
- 1% per one foot of distance

The chance of detection should be rolled upon initial contact, once for
every three turns of exposure or one turn of direct conversation, and
once for an attempt to determine authenticity. The spell may not be
immediately recognised as an illusion, even if a fault is detected, for
it could be seen as a disguise or a physical change (as with a
doppleganger). Note that strong physical contact could reveal the
spell, as the illusion is only visual. Also, unless a Voice spell is
also used, observers could become very suspicious. The size of the
alteration can be 50% of actual. Note that the change is entirely
illusionary (unlike Alter Self) -- no actual physical properties are
gained whatsoever and special abilities (gaze attacks, horror effects,
etc.) cannot be reproduced so as to have these special effects.

yards range.

Improved Identify (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: Special

Inaudibility (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell completely masks all sounds made by the recipient. These
include sounds such as breathing, talking, as well as sounds made when
the recipient strikes another object, in fact, any object held by the
recipient will also likewise be silenced.

Object thrown, dropped, or knocked over by the recipient will not be
silenced by the spell, as they are not in contact with the inaudible
creature.

An unwilling creature is allowed to make a saving throw against this
spell, and it is a great way to silence spell casters (unless they have
the spell vocalise).

The material component for this spell is a piece of cotton.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last Experience (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: 0

Lightservant (Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 turns per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 3" radius around caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a variation of the first-level magic-user spell Unseen
Servant. The servant created by this spell is visible as a vaguely
manlike form of glowing light, and is slightly stronger, being able to
lift 3000 GP weight and taking 8 hit points of magical damage to
destroy. The light provided by the servant is enough to allow normal
vision in a 1" radius around the servant. Except as noted above, and
that the material components of this spell are a live firefly and a
piece of thread, this spell behaves as Unseen Servant.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Mike's Projection (Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, M
Duration: 1/2 hour per level maximum
Casting time: 2
Area of Effect: One 100 feet high, 100-foot radius cylinder
Saving Throw: None

For this spell to take effect, the mage makes a cone out of a sheet of
parchment and places inside it one copper coin for each 5 minutes of
spell effect. The magic words are chanted and the parchment cone
crumpled and released. When the parchment cone is crumpled, it is
replaced by a 4 inch diameter, black, sphere which remains at its
location of creation for the duration of the spell.

The black sphere is the center of a cylinder 10 feet high with a
10-foot radius. Any sound within the cylinder is projected into a
surrounding cylinder which is 100 feet high and has a 100-foot radius.
The black sphere is also the center of this cylinder.

Anyone within the 100 foot cylinder hears sounds as if they were in a
corresponding location within the 10 foot cylinder.

This spell was created my Michael Verilait, a mage who was usually
frustrated at not being able to hear what was happening on stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Creation (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can create a pattern for use with the spell
Malta's Pattern Transport. The Pattern can be any image with any
colours, but it must include a circle which forms the outer edge. The
Pattern can be any inch radius, but the cost of making the Pattern is
dependent on the materials used - so bigger Patterns cost more. The
Pattern can be woven into cloth, painted onto cloth or a hard surface,
or inlaid into a hard surface. The Pattern must be at least one yard in
diameter with no maximum size. The cost to make a Pattern is equal to
the square yards of the Pattern times the amount below:

Material		Cost		Time		Save
----------------	--------	--------	----
Painted on Cloth	5 Silver	1 hour		15
Woven into Cloth	1 Gold		10 hours	12
Woven into Rug		2 Gold		15 hours	10
Painted on Wood		1 Gold		3 hours		10
Painted on Stone	2 Gold		4 hours		8
Inlaid in Wood		3 Gold		12 hours	5
Inlaid in Stone		5 Gold		16 hours	2

Patterns cannot be repaired, they must be remade completely. Patterns
can be moved (assuming the material can be moved as one unit) without
damage. The saving throw listed is the save the Pattern must make when
used for transport (see Malta's Pattern Transport for details) - the
material saves normally for any other damaging situation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Image (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One Pattern
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can imprint the size and image of an
undamaged Pattern. This imprinted image can later be used by the caster
to create a matching Pattern of his own. The imprinted image can be
recalled by the caster for up to one month per caster's level (at
casting time). If this time is exceeded, or the caster creates a
matching Pattern (even if different size), then the imprinted image is
dispelled. This spell is necessary to create an exact size matching
Pattern if the original Pattern is not present for the creation of the
matching Pattern. The caster can have up to one imprinted image/size
per level at a time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mangar's Bloodfire (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2 (check each round)

This spell engulfs a creature with blue fire that burns for 1d4 HP per
3 caster levels (or fraction thereof) on round 1, then loses 1d4 per
round until it goes out. The flames do not ignite flammable objects,
they just hurt creatures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memorise Song (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to memorise the next song he hears. From
then on, the caster can sing and play the song exactly as he heard it,
without worrying about forgetting verses or notes later on in life.

This is especially useful for traveling minstrels, who must remember
someone else's songs for a long time in order to sing them (in other
words, "spread the news") in far away lands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mimicry (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the first level magic user spell Minor
Mimicry (q.v.). However, the spell continues even after a form is
dispelled by movement, and once the spell recipient again becomes
stationary, she or he can be concealed by a new form (again chosen by
the magic user). Therefore, the only ways the spell would end are an
end to concentration by the magic user or the spell recipient passing
beyond 1" range per level. If the casters' concentration is ended, any
illusionary form will last 5 rounds + 1 round per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Noise Filter (Illusion)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 5-foot per level radius
Saving Throw: Special

All creatures within the area effect at the time of casting will have
their hearing muted - they will not hear anything unless they have some
other confirmation of its existence. Thus, you can only hear people
speak if you can see their face or know precisely what they will say;
background noise will continue if you know it should be there but
sudden noises from the next room will not be heard, etc. Once a
creature notices or becomes suspicious of the effect (by turning around
and seeing a large pile of broken crockery they did not hear break, for
example), it will automatically be dispelled with respect to that
creature. The material component is a pair of blinders.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow (Enchantment)

Range: Special
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d6 turns + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When cast, Paldeggeron's Accurate Arrow minorly enchants one missile
weapon (i.e. sling stone, arrow, quarrel, etc.) to automatically hit
any target normally within the weapon's range. Effective with "called
shots", and situations of that nature. The missile's enchantment does
normal damage as it were an unaided hit of the same nature. The
enchantment instantly wears off upon the arrival at the missile's
destination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Petition (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: Special
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is used to alert an extra-planar being that the caster
wishes to contact it. The spell does not allow further communication
(though the extra-planar being may then contact the caster through
other magic).

phenomenon in spell range, or the Plane reachable by the closest gate
or dimensional nexus point. Hostile or unwilling creatures save vs.

detection by this spell for 24 hours.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pobithakor's Pacifier (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 second
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used when the caster is the subject of the Pobithakor's
placer spell. What this spell does is disrupts the energies and allows
the caster a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the effect. There is
enough time when the caster is being pulled through to cast this
spell.

The verbal component varies, but usually sounds something like "not
tonight, I have a headache" or "not on the first date".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Enchantment (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell is partially immune to magical forms of
sleep, charm, and fear. He automatically receives a saving throw even
if one is not ordinarily permitted, and if one is permitted, he saves
at +4. Note that this spell will not free the recipient from any
enchantment already in force, nor will it protect him from natural
drowsiness or feminine guile. Also note that protection extends only to
actual charm spells, such as charm person or charm monster, not to
enchantment/charm spells as a class. The material component is a lapis
lazuli or more potent stone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Cold (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the first level
clerical spell Resist Cold (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, and Hold spells,
but it does not negate paralysis already in effect. The material
component is a feather and an infusion of tea and ginger (to be
consumed by the recipient).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reveal Owner (Divination)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One item
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell receives a mental impression of the most
recent owner or owners of the recipient object. An "owner" is defined
as an intelligent entity who was in direct physical contact (i.e., no
gloves) with the object one hour, or who had the object upon his person
for 24 hours. These time requirements may be divided by the caster's
level, and for every 4 levels of the caster, one previous owner can be
identified. Thus an eighth level wizard, for example, could determine
the last two owners who carried the object for at least 3 hours each.

The information gained is sufficient that the wizard will recognise the
owner on sight, and he can uniquely specify the owner for the purpose
of such spells as legend lore. The material component of this spell is
a handful of dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Golden Squares of Protection (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One floating 2' long square plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering square plates of force which move
around the caster in a constant motion, attempting to deflect missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
not altered by the spell, but any successful physical attack (less
boulders, ballista, or attacks similar to a dragon's belly flop
maneuver) will be deflected if the mage successfully saves versus
breath weapons. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective
strength of 19 or greater require a saving throw versus spells to
deflect.

Each plate is able to sustain 4 hit points of damage before disrupting,
so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to disrupt a
square (chosen randomly) the square will remain active. For every 5
squares active, the effects of breath weapons directed at the caster
will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with 1 hit point damage
per die being the maximum reduction allowable. Though, unless the
breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
square it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of squares in the
process.

While the squares orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for every
square active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including spells. The
mage may create fewer squares than the maximum possible. The material
component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for every square
created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they disappear and
are replaced by the floating squares.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Secret Torch (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns
Casting Time: 1 round per torch
Area of effect: One torch per 2 levels
Saving Throw: None

This spell lights one or more ordinary torches. The flames will,
however, be cold and dark, shedding no ordinary light. The wielder of
the torch will however be able to see by the torch, as if it was an
ordinary torch, as long as he has it in his hand. Only one person can
benefit from the torch at a given time: if two or more persons touch
it, no-one will benefit. The wielder must hold it in his bare hand if he
wants to see by it, and the flames will seem warm to him. The torch can
be put aside or handed over, as an ordinary torch would be, but can not
set fire to anything. It can be extinguished by any normal means, e.g.
water or very strong winds. The torch will slowly smoulder and burn
out, as an ordinary torch would.

The material components are the torch(es) to be lit, and a small
portion of oil with rare herbs, which the torches are rubbed with (3
GP's worth per torch). In addition, the spellcaster must have access to
a source of fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shield II (Abjuration)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Save: None

This spell creates an invisible barrier in a hemisphere around the
caster. This barrier provides the equivalent protection of:

AC. 0	vs. hand thrown objects (daggers, dart, throwing axes, etc.);
AC. 1	vs. device propelled (arrows, bolts, etc.);
AC. 2	vs. everything else.

Against magic the caster gains +1 to saves vs. things that are
physically damaging, negates magic missiles, and decreases spell damage
by 1 point per level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shocksphere (Evocation)

Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 2" diameter sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a small ball of crackly blue light which expands
outwards when it contacts a solid object, hits its target, reaches its
maximum range or it reaches the point where the caster wishes it to
expand. When it does expand, a large amount of electrical energy is
given off, small lightning bolts arc from object to object inside the
sphere and blue light is given off in a 6" diameter sphere. All
creatures within the area of effect must make a save vs. spells or take
1-3 points of damage per level of the caster (a successful save means
damage is halved). If a particular creature was targeted for the spell
then they take 1-4 damage per level of the caster and their saving
throw is made at a -2.

If the area in which the Shocksphere expands is not circular then the
sphere will expand an conform to the volume it can occupy. The
Shocksphere covers a volume of 4200 cubic feet.

If a creature fails its saving throw vs. spell then all of his items
must make a saving throw vs. lightning or be destroyed.

Otherwise this spell is similar to a Fireball spell in many respects.
The material components for the spell is a small chunk of dried flesh
from an electric eel or any other creature that uses electricity for an
attack.

Sillvatar's Silver Lining (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One melee weapon, 2 arrows or 2 bolts
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used to temporarily enchant a weapon to give it the
properties of a silver weapon. In order for this spell to work, the
caster must have 1 silver piece per pound of the weapon to be
enchanted. When the spell is cast, the weapon is held in one hand, and
the silver pieces in the other; the two are then touched together, and
the blade "absorbs" the silver pieces. For the duration of the spell,
or until it is dispelled, the weapon will have all the properties of a
silver weapon (i.e. it may be used to hit creatures who are normally
harmed only by silver weapons). If one looks closely at the weapon, a
silver glint will be seen upon its edge.

This spell will only enchant slashing or piercing weapons; blunt
weapons are not affected by this spell. One melee weapon, or up to two
arrows or bolts may be enchanted per casting of this spell.

The only components for this spell are the weapon and the silver
pieces; the silver pieces are lost, but the weapon is unharmed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonic Barrier (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an invisible, spherical barrier through which sound
cannot pass. The barrier remains centered on the caster, enabling an
assault group to move in absolute silence without giving up
inter-communication. However, sound cannot pass into the barrier
either, making the party deaf for the duration. The material component
is a glass globe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Lodestone (Divination)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster is able to determine the general direction
of a creature within the one mile, per every three levels of the
caster (i.e. two mile range at fourth level, three at seventh, etc.).
This direction sense last for the duration of the spell, regardless of
the movement of the caster, or the creature. If the distance between
the caster and the target should exceed the maximum range (target
teleports, etc.), the spell is broken.

If the caster comes within three feet of the object of the spell, he
gets a sharp headache. If the caster actually touches the object of the
spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of this spell is some item which was in contact
with the creature, up to the caster's level in turns previously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spider Climb II (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Save: None

By this spell, the creature can walk on any surface and not slip. The
creature can walk on walls, ceilings, ice, etc. and not slip or slide
(feet are like suction cups to the surface). The creature can also
have one jump like the spell jump from TSR's books (this is only one
jump, not three like the first level spell gives).

The jump does not include a safe landing, but by using this spell, the
creature can jump up on a wall and start climbing, or climb up some
wall and jump to a different wall.

The material components needed are: a piece of gum (tree sap, or some
type of sticky substance) and a small jumping spider (a grass hopper
leg and a piece of spider webbing can be used as a substitute).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Undead (Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell causes 3 HD of undead per 2 levels of the caster to appear
within range. They will obey his commands until slain, dispelled, or
the spell ends. The wizard may mix and match types as long as he does
not exceed his HD allotment.

The necromancer cannot summon a creature of more HD than his level.
Treat a +3 or better bonus to HD as the next die up, so a wight is
worth 5 HD and a wraith is 6, a mummy 7, spectre 8, and a vampire (the
toughest undead that can be summoned) is worth 9.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transcribe Song (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One piece of paper
Saving Throw: None

This spell converts sound waves from a song currently being played
within hearing range of the bard to musical notation onto a piece of
paper the bard has in his possession. It will transcribe up to one
round's worth of music into the musical notation most familiar to the
bard.

This spell is useful for keeping records of new songs, or for keeping
track of songs the bard is worried about forgetting. It does not work
well for conversations, since it does not transcribe the words of
songs, only the noted of the song itself.

The material components for this spell are a piece of paper or
parchment, two ounces of good ink, and a grain of diamond dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trosli's Spontaneous Defenestration (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates an illusion of a window in a wall near the subject.
The subject must save vs. spells or be seized by an irresistible
compulsion to leap through the supposed window, bonking his head on the
wall and taking 1-4 points of damage per level of the caster and being
stunned for one round. Non-intelligent creatures are immune to this
spell, and creatures immune to blunt weapons, or unable to perform
leaping actions, take no damage. The material component is a small
pane of glass, which is consumed in casting.

This spell was researched by the gnomish illusionist/thief Trosli
Kenderkin, a notorious trickster who once took out five gnolls (at
first level) with a bag of marbles and a dagger.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veschiul's Shadowbolt (Evocation)

Range: 12"
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The spell Shadowbolt allows the mage to mold a bolt of shadow from the
Plane of Shadow, and fire it up to 120' range. A to-hit roll is
required, but is made as a fighter at a level of 1.5 times the mage's
level, rounded up. The Shadowbolt does damage by impact: at ranges
under 40', the damage is 1d4 per level, at ranges between 40' and 80'
the damage is 1d4 per 2 levels, and at greater ranges the damage is 1d4
per 4 levels. The number of dice should be rounded down in all cases
(thus, a fifth level mage at 50' does 2d4 damage, but a sixth level
mage does 3d4). The creature must make a DEX check to remain standing,
adjusted by a -1 for every two levels of the mage (again, rounded
down), as well as by mass:

Mass (pounds)	DEX adjustment	Distance
-------------	--------------	--------
1 - 30		-8		25'
31 - 60		-6		20'
61 - 90		-4		15'
91 - 120	-3		10'
121 - 150	-2		5'
151 - 180	-1		-
181 - 210	0		-
211 - 240	+1		-
241 - 270	+2		-
271 - 300	+3		-
300 +		+4		-

The distance column indicates how far the target has been knocked away
from the mage if the modified DEX check was failed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veschiul's Shadowcurse (Alteration)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

The Shadowcurse can affect any creature of the world of light. The area
of effect is one creature for every two levels of the mage above first;
i.e. a third level mage can affect one creature, a fifth can affect
two, and so on. The effect of the Shadowcurse is to afflict the victims
with some of the vulnerabilities of a shade. The effects depend on the
light conditions, as shown on the following table:

Light		Abilities	Move		Maximum HP
--------	---------	----		----------
Bright		-2		1/2		1/2
Average		-1		3/4		3/4
Twilight	-		-		-
Shadowy		-		-		-

See the description of Shade in the MM II for exact descriptions of
these light conditions. The material component is a piece of pitch.

Wings (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3 rounds to cast, 3 more for wings to grow
Area Of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the caster creates "wings" to appear out of the effected
creature's back. The wings are magically attached to the back area,
but are not attached in the sense that the person can be wearing
clothing or armour. They are not part of the creature. The wings need
a +1 magical weapon to hit, have AC 7 and have 2-12 hitpoints before
being destroyed. The spell has no effect on creatures that already have
wings. If there is no room for the wings to grow, e.g. because of
clothing, the spell is lost.

The wings can support a total of 200 pounds + 20 pounds per level. They
give an aerial maneuver rating of C, and fly at a rate of 12".

The material component of this spell is a bird's feather. The wings
appear to be the same colour as that of the bird feather used in the
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wound Closure (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell closes the wounds of the recipient to prevent bleeding and
infection, incidentally curing 1-4 hit points of damage. All of the
victim's wounds will be closed by a single casting, but further
application is possible to increase the healing effect. The spell can
be used on corpses to disguise the cause of death, but it does not work
on non-corporeal or extra-planar entities.

Note: A recent posting suggested that mages be able to cast healing
spells using 1d6 instead of 1d8. I believe the above spell description
shows my opposition to that approach (see also DMGv2 p. 43), unless you
intend to do away with clerics as a PC class. From a game mechanics
standpoint, such an approach would destroy the balance between priest
and mage, but there is a campaign background reason as well:
Pseudo-medieval medical knowledge would be atrocious. Clerical healing
is a gift from God or the gods, relatively omniscient and omnipotent
fellows, but magical curing would depend upon the mage's understanding
of the body and its functions. Thus you might find a wizard who can
pull the edges of a wound back together, as described above, but you
could not find one who could stimulate the replication of tissue of
various injured organs, insure an increased blood supply to the
affected regions, metabolise fat and increase respiration to enrich
said blood, etc. You certainly could not find a mage to cure diseases
before any microbes are discovered.

Zombie (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Skeleton in most respects. Instead of
creating a skeleton, it creates a zombie. The caster may control a
number of zombies made by this spell equal to half his level, round
down. The material component is a salve that costs 100 GP and 48 hours
of uninterrupted time.

Alpha's Comet (Conjuration, Evocation)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a flaming missile with a trail of superheated
noxious gasses.  The comet unerringly strikes one target, the impact
causing 3d6 damage and the flames an additional 3d6.  Furthermore, any
creature within 5' of the comet's path will suffer 2d4 fire damage.
All those within 5' of the point of impact will suffer 3d4.  Anyone who
suffers damage from this spell is also considered to have been engulfed
in the noxious fumes, and will be at -2 on all rolls (10% spell failure
chance) for 1-6 rounds due to coughing, choking, and blurred vision.
The material component is a ball of pitch mixed with sulfur and
phosphorus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Darklight (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as the second level magic-user spell
darkness 15' radius (q.v.), except in that the caster can see normally
through the darkness so created as if in normal lighting conditions.
Alternatively, the caster can bestow the visual benefits to another
character by crushing the material component and sprinkling the dust
into the eyes of the recipient.  The material component is a piece of
coal or charcoal, which must be crushed and applied as above.  Note
that the spell only allows normal vision through the darkness caused by
the particular casting, and lends no benefit towards other darkness,
either normal or magical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Flames of the Faltine (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell sheathes the caster in hot yellow flames and blurs the
caster's features somewhat, causing them to assume a smooth and
somewhat indistinct shape, also turning a dark red colour.  The flames
will appear to be present even coming out of the caster's eyes and
mouth.  These flames give the caster no special protection, but they do
shed bright light in a 30' radius.  Furthermore, any creature striking
the caster with a claw, bite, or similar attack or a hand-held weapon
less than 5 feet long will suffer damage as though contacting a Wall of
Fire spell (q.v.) - 2d6 damage + 1 point per level of the caster.
Undead suffer double damage, and creatures especially susceptible to
flame may also take additional damage.  The caster may attempt a melee
attack to burn others with this fire, a successful blow causing 1d6
damage + 1 point per two levels of the caster.  Creatures passing
within a 5' radius of the caster suffer 1d4 heat damage.  By standing
still and concentrating, the caster may extend this heat radiation,
inflicting 2d4 within a 5' radius and 1d4 within a 10' radius, but this
falls back to the usual level if the caster stops concentrating or
resumes moving.  The caster can attempt to destroy inanimate objects by
touching them, requiring a save vs. normal fire to avoid destruction.
This may be attempted once per round, at a -1 cumulative penalty for
each consecutive round of handling.  Items on the caster's person at
the time of the casting of this spell are unaffected by the flame.  The
caster may end this spell prematurely if desired.  The material
component for this spell is a flask of oil, poured over the caster's
head during the casting of the spell, and an open flame of any size.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Heat Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls down a bolt of reddish-purple lightning which strikes
a single creature within range.  The bolt inflicts 1d6 of damage per
level of the caster.  Cold or water-based creatures suffer an
additional 1 point of damage per die, while creatures resistant to heat
OR electricity suffer 1/2 normal damage (1/4 with a successful save).
All non-magical metal worn by the target must save vs. lightning (at +2
if the save was made, but at -2 if the save was failed) or be fused to
any nearby metal (sword fused to gauntlet, pieces of armour fused
together, preventing movement).  The material component of this spell
is a short glass rod, a bit of fur, and a bit of iron or lodestone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Ice Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the magic-user opens a small hole in the spatial
fabric into the supernatural cold of the para-elemental plane of ice.
It brings forth a shaft of solid para-elemental ice 6 inches thick and
10 feet long (the hole is opened for only a very brief time).  This
missile hits with great force, causing 3-30 points of damage from the
impact alone.  If the target saves vs. petrification, only a glancing
blow is dealt, and the victim suffers only 1-10 points of damage.

An additional save (also vs. petrification, and at +4 if only a
glancing blow was suffered) must be made, or the victim will be stunned
for 1-6 rounds from the force of the blow.

The ice absorbs heat from the nearby air, and this causes 1-6 points of
cold damage (no saving throw) to all within 5 feet of the bolt's path,
and within a 10' radius of the target creature.  The bolt shatters upon
striking its target, and the victim will suffer an additional 4-24
points of cold damage (2-12 if only a glancing blow was suffered).

Fire-using creatures take double damage from the cold caused by the
bolt, while those resistant to cold take none.  Both types of creatures
suffer full damage from the bolt itself.

Water-based creatures in liquid form will suffer only 1-10 points of
damage from the blow, and cannot be stunned, but they will
automatically be slowed for 2-8 melee rounds.

If the target creature is struck fully (i.e. fails the initial saving
throw), then exposed items on that side of the caster must make a save
vs.  crushing blow, and all items carried by the caster must save vs.
magical frost (note also that items on the side struck by the bolt must
save at -10, due to the cold and the blow).

The material component of this spell is a clear gem worth not less than
100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Images of Ikonn (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Mirror Image spell (q.v.).  The
caster gains 1 mirror image for each level of experience, rather than
rolling randomly.  These images can appear anywhere within 15' of the
caster, and a blurring distortion effect occurs in the casting of this
spell and at the end of each melee round which prevents isolation of
the true wizard in the new melee round, even if the wizard was
successfully attacked in the previous round.  Area effect attacks
(Fireball, etc.) can still affect the caster even if his location is
not known.  As a final benefit, if one of the images is struck by an
opponent, the caster may make an unmodified save vs. breath weapon.  If
successful, the image will not be dispelled by the blow.  The material
component of this spell is a small carving or doll of the caster and a
broken mirror.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Lightwall (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10' per level long square
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a wall of dazzling yellow-white light to come into
being at any point within the range of the caster.  Vision through the
wall by any means is quite impossible, though it is negated by a
darkness (q.v.) spell cast at it.  When the wall first comes into
being, all those within 10 feet of it who are not averting their eyes
(thus a mage could warn his companions that he was about to cast this
spell) must make a save vs. petrification to avert their gaze from the
wall in time to avoid being dazzled by its brightness.  This dazzling
results in a -2 penalty to hit, a 20% spell failure chance for spell
casters, and a -1 penalty on initiative dice rolls.  These effects
persist for as many rounds as the difference between the victim's die
roll and the roll needed for him to save.  These effects can persist
even after the duration of the spell has elapsed.  Naturally, blind or
sightless creatures are unaffected by this spell, but subterranean or
dark dependent creatures (e.g. drow, duergar, svirfneblin) suffer a -3
on their saving throw.  Further, they are not protected by their normal
magic resistance, as the spell is not cast directly at them.  They are
as vulnerable to its existence as any other creature would be.  The
light given off is equivalent to a continual light (q.v.) spell within
20', and equivalent to a light spell (i.e. normal torchlight) in an
additional 80' radius.  The Lightwall, if cast out of doors, can be
seen up to a mile away per level of the caster (reflecting the
additional size of a larger caster's Lightwall).  The wall can, of
course, be created smaller than the maximum size for the caster's
level.  The wall itself causes no damage to creatures passing through
it.  However, a character fighting someone with a Lightwall directly
behind him suffers a -1 on his chances to hit (note that this is
cumulative with the dazzling effects described above).  Similarly to
the first level wall of darkness (q.v.) spell, sound is blocked by the
Lightwall, assuming that it does not allow sound waves to travel around
the sides of it (as when cast outdoors, for example).  It does not
absorb sound or prevent spellcasting, it merely does not allow sound to
pass through it (even if such sound is from a Horn of Blasting or a
Shout spell).  The material component is a clear gemstone or a sunstone
worth not less than 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Lucent Lance (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

There must be some ambient light available in order for this spell to
work.  The effectiveness of this spell is determined by the amount of
ambient light available.  The caster must concentrate for a full round
to focus the light into the Lucent Lance, after which its energy may be
released.  The power of the Lance is such that it can carve through
wood or soft metal up to 4 inches thick, stone up to 1 inch thick, or
hard metal up to .25 inch thick, this thickness multiplied by the
appropriate modifier on the table below.  Items carried by a living
creature are partially protected by that creature's aura, and gain a
save vs. magical fire (modified as below) to avoid being damaged by the
Lance.  Living creatures suffer a base of 1d6 damage, modified as
below, with a maximum upper limit of not more than 1d6 per level of the
caster.  The Lucent Lance coalesces as a ball of light around the
caster's hand holding the material component, and shoots forth until
maximum range is reached or until a sufficient thickness of material
blocks its progress.  The Lucent Lance may be traversed over an arc up
to 1' per level of the caster at its maximum range.  The caster's hand
glows brightly while the spell is being cast and while it is active.

						Damage		Save
Type of light					Modifier	Modifier
------------------------------------------	--------	--------
Candlelight					x.5		+3
Single torch or lantern				x 1		+1
Multiple torches, Light spell, starlight,
	magical dagger				x 2		+0
Large bonfire, bright moonlight, Continual
	Light spell, magical sword		x 4		-1
Multiple magical light sources, indirect
	or filtered sunlight			x 6		-2
Direct sunlight, Sunray spell			x 12		-4

If the light source used is a fire of some sort, that fire has a 50%
chance of going out.  A permanent light effect (e.g. magical sword or
dagger) will lose its power to shed light for 1d10 rounds.  A spell
used as the light source will be automatically dispelled if it's a
1st-3rd level spell, and will have its duration cut by 25% if a higher
level spell.  The material component is a small, oblong corundum rod
worth at least 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Night of the Leonids (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast outdoors at night.  It calls down a number
of flaming meteorites to strike unerringly any targets within range.
The caster can call down 1d4 meteorites, plus another for every five
levels of experience (d4+1 at 5th-9th, d4+2 at 10th-14th, etc.).  Each
meteorite strikes a single target, though more than one may strike any
given target.  Each of these "Leonids" comes blazing down from the
heavens, striking for d6+1 impact damage and an additional d6+1 fire
damage. The material component for this spell is a bit of meteoric
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rolling Thunder (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' per level radius circle
Saving Throw: Special

The caster need but throw his arms heavenward and a great rolling
thunderclap will sound directly overhead. All creatures within 10' of
the caster must save vs. petrification or be knocked prone, suffering
1d4 + 1 damage, and are automatically stunned for 1 round and deafened
for 1d4 + 1 rounds. Those within one-half the radius of the spell (e.g.
within 25' of a 10th level caster) but not within 10' must save vs.
spells or be stunned for 1 round, and are automatically deafened for
1d4 + 1 rounds.  All others in the area of effect must save vs. spells
or be deafened for 1d4 + 1 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Silverlight (Evocation)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30' radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 2nd level Continual Light spell in that it
creates a very bright light (almost as bright as full daylight).
However, any creature within the area of light which is vulnerable to
silver (e.g. wights, wraithes, lycanthropes, devils) will suffer 1d6
damage every round that it remains in the area of effect, and will be
at -2 to on to hit rolls and +2 to be hit due to the intense discomfort
felt by such creatures while within the Silverlight. Alternatively, the
caster may throw the spell directly at a single target. Such a creature
must save vs. spells or be blinded for the duration of the spell. If
the save is made, the spell forms as per usual about one foot behind
the intended target, and its duration is halved. A creature vulnerable
to silver who is thus targeted need not save vs. blinding, but will
instead suffer d6+1 (2-7) points of damage per level of the caster, up
to a maximum of 10d6+10, and will be stunned for 1d4 rounds. A
successful saving throw vs. spells at -2 will halve the damage and
reduce the duration of the stun to a single round. If thrown thus at a
creature vulnerable to silver, the spell will not form normally,
regardless of the saving throw, as its magic is used up in the attack
on the creature. The material component is a bit of pure silver.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starfire (Evocation)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' diameter column, 30' high
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a column of brilliant, blazing silvery-white
flames.  All within 10' of the column not looking away must save vs.
petrification or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled (-2 to hit, +2 to
be hit) for an additional 1d3 rounds.  Creatures adversely affected by
bright light (e.g drow, duergar) save at -3 vs. this effect.  Any
creature within the narrow column of fire (most likely only a single
creature) is automatically blinded and dazzled as above, and
additionally suffers 1d6 damage per level of the caster, up to a
maximum of 10d6.  A save vs. spells will halve this damage.  If the
spell is cast outdoors under a night sky, a bonus of +1 per die of
damage is added.  The material component for this spell is a bit of
silver and a shard of crystal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Astral Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)

Range: 1 yard per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level, 5-foot radius at first level
Saving Throw: None

This creates a wall (which can have any shape the caster desires,
including a sphere) which prevents physical effects which would pass
through normal walls, such as Teleport, Astral Projection, Monkish
"phase" ability, etc. Any such attempt by a character will fail,
leaving the character on the other side of the wall. It is, however,
possible to simply walk through an Astral Wall. If the spell is linked
to an existing physical wall (including one created by Wall of Stone or
Iron), the duration becomes one hour per level. The Astral Wall can be
disrupted by Dispel Magic cast from either the physical or astral
plane. The material component is a piece of parchment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azalldam's Waterspray (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 50' long, 5' to 15' wide cone
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell causes a high-pressured cone of water to stream from the
caster's hand; this cone is 50 feet long, 5 feet wide at the caster's
hand, and 15 feet wide at the base. The majority of damage is caused by
the high pressure of the stream; anyone caught inside the area of
effect suffers 3d8 points of damage; a successful saving throw vs.
spell will reduce this damage by one half. Those who fail their saves
must roll saves vs. crushing blow for all their possessions to avoid
their destruction. In addition, victims who fail their initial saves
must make a dexterity check; if this check fails, the target is pushed
backwards 1-20 yards, and is knocked prone.

The water from this spell will extinguish any normal fires, but has
only a 50% chance to put out magical fires. This spell will inflict
double damage on fire elementals or similar creatures.

The material component for this spell is a large beaker of water which
is used up when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brains (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: S, M
Duration: 6 hours per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains a temporary increase in intelligence
as follows:

Normal	Extra
Int	Points
------	------
1-4	4
5-8	3
9-11	2
12-13	1

Note: this is not cumulative.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Burning Hands II (Alteration)

Range: 10'
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is exactly the same as its namesake except that it does
twice the amount of damage and reaches 10' out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Channel Item (Enchantment, Invocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One rechargeable magic item
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is used to recharge any item which was initially created by
the use of an Enchant an Item spell, such as magical rings, gems, rods,
staves, and wands; but not limited to such.

The wizard must be fully rested and not engaged in any physical
activity to cast this spell. Usually, most mages try to find a secure
area since the chance of spell failure can be deadly. He first cast
this spell over the item, in the process opening up a channel between
him and the magic item to be recharged, taking one round to initiate
the channel. At this time, the total possible charges an item may
contain may be discerned by casting an Identify at this time with a
modifier of +10% added onto his normal chance of success. Then, the
appropriate spells must be cast into the item to affect its
recharging. While the spells needed for various items are too large to
be listed, it can be assumed that a spell which the item imitates is
able to recharge the item. (Spell research can aid in gaining more
knowledge of this subject).

At the end of the recharging session (or at least before the channeling
effect ends due to the casting time limitations) the mage must "close"
the item's channel. This requires a successful saving throw vs. spells
modified by +1 for every level of the spellcaster and -1 for every
spell cast into the item which did nothing to recharge it. A failed
saving throw means that none of the spells cast into the item had any
recharging affect. If the mage is physically attacked and/or the spell
disrupted during the recharging period the mage must make an unmodified
successful saving throw vs. spells, with a successful save indicating
the entire process has been merely cast for naught and a failed save
indicating that the magic item explodes for a magical blast effect in a
10- to 60-foot radius doing damage equal to 1-4 HP of damage per charge
the item currently contains (save vs. spells for half damage). The item
in question (unless of artifact or relic status) is irrevocably ruined
in the explosion. The material component of this spell is a small gold
funnel worth at least 100 GP value, which is destroyed in the casting
of the spell.

The source of this spell is the Telnorne Mageocrat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Charm Undead (Enchantment/Charm, Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One or more creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell works just like the Players' Handbook spell Charm Monster,
except as noted above and that it only works on undead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conceal Magic (Divination)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 hours per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: Negates

Cast it on a magic item and it renders that item undetectable by Detect
Magic (great for hiding magical traps). The caster will not know if the
object has made its saving throw, though he can of course check this by
casting a Detect Magic...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Curse Weapon (Enchantment)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One weapon
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is used to curse the weapon of an opponent. When it is cast,
the caster chooses which weapon to curse. Unless the owner of the
weapon makes a successful save vs. spell, that weapon will have a
penalty applied to all "to hit" and damage rolls for the duration of
this spell. The penalty is equal to 1 for every four levels of the
caster, to a maximum of -5. This penalty only applies to the chosen
weapon, not to other weapons carried by the owner.

This spell will negate magical bonuses (only for the spell's duration);
if a weapon's magical bonus is reduced, its current value is used for
determining which types of creatures may be hit by it (i.e. if a +4
sword is reduced to +1 by this spell, it may not be used to hit
elementals for the duration of the spell).

The material component of this spell is a small replica of the weapon
to be cursed; it is consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Charm (Divination)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature per round
Saving Throw: None

This spell will reveal whether or not a recipient is under the effect
of a charm spell, provided that the recipient fails his saving throw.
Up to ten persons can be checked before the spell wanes. The caster has
a 5% chance per level of determining the exact nature of the charm
spell (or spells) which affect the recipient.

Detect Teleport (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 24" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Aftering casting this spell the caster gets an impression whenever
anyone arrives via teleport, enters or leaves the prime material plane
in the area of effect. The spell lasts only while the caster
concentrates on it. The impression will not reveal the location within
the range in which the effect occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Eldritch Sphere (Evocation)

Range: 2" + 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1' diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This potent spell launches a mentally guided 1' diameter globe which
travels 0' - 60' per segment and turns up to 90 degrees per round. The
sphere strikes as a monster of the caster's hit dice, but even on a
missed roll, the missile may return the following round as long as the
magic-user concentrates. Once it hits, the globe disperses and inflicts
2d6 base damage + 2 damage points per level of its caster to the first
creature touched, up to 2d6 + 20 maximum potential (e.g. an 8 hit die
eldritch sphere inflicts 22-32 damage points).

The sphere harmlessly vanishes if the caster's concentration is broken
or the globe exceeds maximum range. Despite its limited area of effect,
the eldritch's sphere's true advantage is its damage potential and
ability to pursue and possibly corner single foes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eldarr's Spell Conversion (Alteration) Level 3

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows its caster to convert one spell into another of the
caster's choice. As long as the Spell Conversion is in effect, when
another spell is cast, the wizard may choose to cast it normally, or
alter it into another spell. The spell to be altered must be of 3rd
level or lower, and the spell to be converted to, must be of 2nd level
or lower (the addition level of power is expended in the conversion
process) and must be a spell the wizard already knows, although it does
not have to be currently memorised.

This spell is usually cast at the beginning of a day or before a known
encounter, to give the caster ample time to replace it in his memory
with another spell. Only wizard spells may be converted by this spell -
priestly spells are not affected by it, and only the caster's own
spells are affected.  Range, duration, area of effect, and saving
throws are as per the spell being converted to; the spell being
converted determines the spell components and casting time (however, in
order to convert a spell, a few additional incantations are necessary,
and the name of the new spell must also be uttered; this affectively
increases the casting time of the original spell by one).

As an example of the use of this spell, let us assume Biff the wizard
has cast this spell before a large battle; during the fight, Biff finds
himself levitated by an enemy spellcaster and dropped from a great
height. Unfortunately, Biff has nearly used up his compliment of spells
in the battle, and has a single Fireball left - not much use in this
situation. However, since the Spell Conversion is in effect, Biff
starts the incantations of the Fireball anyway; when he is dropped,
Biff casts the Fireball but uses the Spell Conversion to convert it to
a Feather Fall, and he floats softly to the ground unharmed.

The material component for this spell is the pelt of any were-creature;
the pelt is consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhance Illusion (Alteration)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One illusion
Saving Throw: None

This spell is one way for wizards to add actual substance to their
illusions. Up to two rounds before casting an illusion (notably
Phantasmal Force, Improved Phantasmal Force or Spectral Force), the
wizard casts this spell on the area in which the illusion is to
initially appear. Once cast, the illusion then does 10% of the actual
damage that it would do if it were real if the victim made a saving
throw against it, and is treated as normal with respect to armour
class, attacks, etc., if the victim failed the saving throw and doesn't
recognise it as an illusion. The illusion also becomes armour class
10, and gains 10% of the hit points it would normally have; however,
illusionary creatures may never have more combined hit dice than the
caster.

If the illusion is not cast in the enhanced area within 2 rounds the
former spell will be wasted. Multiple enhance illusions on one
illusion will cancel each other. This spell can also be used in
conjunction with shadow monsters, demi-shadow monsters or shades,
adding 10% more realism to that already inherent in the spell, and
lowering the perceived armour class by 1.

Enhance illusion is attributed to the deceased mage Scaurlin Oberlin,
who died in a magical duel with a grey slaad he summoned and
subsequently released. This is reputedly the only spell Scaurlin ever
wrote in his once-promising career.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exploding Coins (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One coin per level (10 maximum)
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to enchant one or more coins with an
explosive charge; the more valuable the coin, the more potent the
explosion (see table below). The coins will retain their enchantment
until used or dispelled; the the explosion will be triggered when the
caster utters a command word chosen during the incantation.
Alternately, the caster may choose a delay, after which time the coin
will explode; the length of this delay may be up to 1 turn per level of
the caster (measured from the time the caster speaks the chosen command
word).

The following table gives the amount of damage for each type of coin,
along with the burst radius, and what level is required to enchant a
particular type of coin:

		burst
type		damage	level	radius
----		------	-----	-------
copper		1d3	5	2 feet
silver		1d4	8	2 feet
electrum	1d6	11	5 feet
gold		1d8	14	5 feet
platinum	1d10	16	10 feet

A maximum of 10 coins may be enchanted per casting of this spell; also,
no more than 20 of these coins may be brought within 30 feet of each
other safely; if this occurs, the owner(s) must make a saving throw vs.
spell for *each* coin. If a coin fails its throw, it explodes normally;
if the throw succeeds, the coin simply vanishes in a puff of smoke.
This spell has the additional limitation that it may only be cast once
per two day period.

The only material component for this spell is the coin to be enchanted;
the coins are consumed in the explosion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flaming Vortex (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 8' high x 2' wide inverted cone
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls into being a spinning vortex of flames that resembles
a burning dust devil; the vortex is 8' high and 2' wide at its widest.
The caster may direct the movement of the vortex in any direction
desired, but it may not be moved across a body of water. The vortex
moves at a rate of 10' per round, and the caster must maintain full
concentration in order to direct its movements; if the caster loses
concentration, the vortex will move in a straight line at full movement
rate until the caster can again gain concentration. The wizard may not
move the vortex further away than 10 yards per level of the caster, or
the spell terminates.

The caster may use the vortex to attack a single victim per round; he
may attack the same target in following rounds, or may elect to move
the vortex to attack a different one. Anyone struck by the vortex
suffers 1d4 points of damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum
of 10d4). A successful save vs. spell reduces this damage by half. The
flames from this spell will ignite flammable materials on contact, but
will not harm most other materials, unless exposure is prolonged. That
is, if a creature is attacked by the vortex for only a single round,
non-flammable possessions are not affected; if attacked on two
consecutive rounds, all possessions must save vs. magical fire normally
(but only if the target fails his save). Each additional round of
exposure inflicts a -1 on all possessions' saves (no penalty in added
to the target's save).

The material component for this spell is a piece of flammable material
suspended from a string; the caster lights the material on fire and
twirls it in a circle while casting the spell. He must continue doing
this throughout the duration of the spell, and the material must remain
lit; if it does not, the spell ends prematurely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Free Action (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the recipient the benefits of Protection from
Paralysis, and the additional benefits of being able to function
without penalty in a constricting environment (such as water, Web
spells, Entangle spells, etc). It does not affect paralysis already
existing, unless it is cast specifically to counter such in which case
it gives no further benefit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gaseous Form (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1d6 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to turn the creature touched into a pink
cloud of gas, for the duration of the spell. If the creature touched is
an unwilling recipient of the spell, he gets a save, with a successful
save negating the spell.

The spells effects are identical to that of the Potion of gaseous form,
with regards to movement rates, and the effects of a Gust of Wind
spell, though the caster, if he casts the spell on himself, can turn
non-gaseous at any time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grasping Hands of Horror (Necromancy)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One arm per level
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell causes a number of arms equal to the level of the caster to
reach out of the ground and grab at the target. The hands themselves do
no damage, but when they pull you under you start to suffocate.
Victims have to make a saving throw every round they are in the area of
effect and for every extra hand they have a -1 on their save.

In a graveyard or similar corpse-infested area there is an additional
-2. If they fail their save, they are dragged underground and start to
suffocate. Others can dig the victim out, mundanely or magically. He
will be found simply two feet or so under the ground, paralysed, but
quite aware of what happened. A really high-level mage could cast this
spell and affect many people by giving five arms to this target, four
to that one, and so on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hang (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, see below
Duration: 3 days
Casting time: Special
Area Of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By this spell, the next spell the caster casts will be held (will not
take effect) until either the duration ends or the caster says a
keyword that will set off the spell.  The Spell that is held must be
third level or lower, and a magic user can only have one spell hung at
any given time.  For those spells that require a direction or a special
action (like pointing a finger for lightning bolt), the caster will
have to say the keyword and point at that time.  It takes one segment
for the held spell to go off (no casting time, only initiative), and
the caster should be given a bonus of +2 (in d6 initiative system) or
-4 (in the 10 segment system).  When the keyword is spoken by the
caster, it is only letting go of stored energy.  The caster still has
80% of his activity left in the round:  the caster can make one attack
or cast one first or second level spell late in the round.

The spell to be held must be cast with extreme caution.  It will take
twice the casting time and twice the components it would normally take
to cast that spell.  If the caster tries to cast another spell while
another spell is hung, the hung spell will fizzle.

No material components are needed to cast the spell hang, but those
needed to cast the next spell after are doubled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Spirit (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 120 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One to 4 spirits in a 20' cube
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell paralyses creatures which do not come from the plane they
are on, including conjured spirits and spirits possessing another
creature. If the spell is cast at 3 or 4 spirits, each gets an
unmodified saving throw. If two are being enspelled, they save at -1.
If there is a single target, it saves at -3. Held beings remain aware
of events around them and can use abilities which do not require motion
or speech. The material component for this is a straight piece of cold
iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Armour (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3 rounds
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the first level spell Armour although it
provides its wearer an armour class of AC 2. The Armour lasts until
dispelled or until it has received 16 + 2 points per level of the
caster worth of damage.

Note: The armour does not absorb damage nor is it ordinarily visible.
It will work with a shield (fighter/mages only), DEX bonuses, and other
magical protection devices, like rings and cloaks of protection,
although it will not protect a creature wearing artificial armour.
Artificial armour includes all manufactured armours, but does not
include skin or hides that are a natural part of the creature to be
protected.

The material component is a small piece of finely cured blessed leather
which the caster must rub all over his body while casting. Note: the
leather is reusable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jam Radio (Alteration, Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell prevents all magical communication spells of first or second
level from crossing the boundary of its area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Prismatic Snowball (Alteration, Conjuration, Enchantment)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One snowball + 1 snowball per 3 levels
Saving Throw: Special

When cast, this spell creates a pile of coloured snowballs at the
caster's feet.  The number of snowballs is equal to the duration of the
spell in rounds - 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 6th level, 4 at 9th level, etc.
The caster can throw one snowball per round as if he were proficient in
snowball throwing.  Other characters can also throw snowballs, but they
will suffer a non-proficiency penalty for it (unless they have taken a
proficiency in snowballs).  The snowball has a range of 30 yards, plus
10 yards per Strength point of the thrower over 12.

The snowballs do no physical damage when they hit; however, they have
powers that vary with the colour of the snowball according to the chart
below.  In order for the snowball's magic to work, the target must be
hit with it (a successful "to hit" roll required).  The snowball's
power only affects the creature hit, even if the spell it duplicates
has a greater area of effect.  The snowballs are always picked up and
thrown in the order given, starting with red and ending (assuming the
spellcaster is high enough level) with violet.

Number	Colour	Save vs.	Effect
------	------	------------	---------------------------------------
1	Red	Spell		Charm Person
2	Orange	Spell		Faerie Fire
3	Yellow	Poison		Taunt *
4	Green	Paralysation	Spook
5	Blue	Paralysation	Glitterdust
6	Indigo	Spell		Bind
7	Violet	Wand		Tasha's Uncontrollable Hideous Laughter

(*) If the yellow snowball hits on an unmodified die roll of 20, the
victim has been hit in the face and has eaten some of the snow.  It
must then make an additional save vs. poison at a -4 or be violently
ill (no attacks, armour class worsens by 4) for a number of hours equal
to the caster's level.

The material components for the spell are a small rainbow-coloured
marble.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kallum's Cold Frost (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a ball of extreme cold and sharp ice particles which
expands outward from its detonation point. All creatures in the area of
effect will take 1d6 hit points of damage per level of the caster from
the cold (save vs. spells for 1/2 damage). All objects in the area of
effect will be frozen, and a layer of frost will cover the surface of
everything in the area of effect. If a creature fails its saving throw
then all of his items must make a saving throw vs. frost or be
destroyed by the extreme cold.

Because of the sharp particles of ice created in the detonation, the
explosion will still cause damage to those who are immune to cold. If a
creature is immune to cold, then the damage will be 1-2 HP per level of
the caster with a saving throw for half as normal.

The spell can do structural damage to wooden structures as can the
Fireball spell.

Otherwise this spell is the same in all respects as Fireball. The
material components for this spell is a handful of glass crystals or
any kind of crystals which is thrown in the direction that the caster
wishes the Iceball to go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Missile II (Evocation)

Range: 60 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One or more creatures in a 10-foot cube
Saving Throw: None

This improvement on the first level Magic Missile allows the caster to
fire 1 missile per 2 levels of experience.  Each bolt can be
individually targeted and does 1d8 point of damage. The spell fires
that number of missiles every round until the caster is hit or ends the
spell. After the initial casting the missiles have a speed factor of 1
each and the caster may move, or engage in any other action besides
spellcasting after the missiles fire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Annoyance (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This is an even more powerful version of the Minor Annoyance and
Annoyance spells (q.v.). It makes the victim's leg hurt, exactly as if
he has barked his shin on something. Although causing no damage, it is
painful enough to disrupt spell casting in the round it is cast in, as
well as subsequent rounds, to the limit of the spell.  The victim also
suffers combat penalties: Armour Class bonuses due to high dexterity are
negated, and attacks are made at a -2 penalty.

A successful save vs. this spell reduces the duration of the spell to
one round per two levels of the caster, and reduces the attack penalty
to -1.

The material component is a coffee bean, carved to look like a
miniature table.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Malta's Pattern Transport (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can move himself and other materials from
one Pattern to another Pattern. The two Patterns must have the same
image and the destination Pattern must be at least as big in radius as
the source Pattern. Both Patterns must be known to the caster (current
locations) and they must be laid flat. The destination Pattern must not
be supporting any object (even partially). The destination Pattern must
also be uncovered such that there is room for the incoming
creatures/objects.

If all of the above conditions exist, then casting the spell will
transport the caster and any objects/creatures which are completely
supported by the source Pattern to the destination Pattern. All objects
transported will end up on the destination Pattern at the same ratio of
distance to the edge as on the source Pattern. That is, if an object is
halfway from the center to the edge on the source Pattern, then it will
be halfway from the center to the edge on the destination Pattern
(regardless of the size of the destination Pattern).

An object is considered to be completely supported by the pattern when
its weight is supported by the material inscribed in the outer circle
of the Pattern or by something which is itself completely supported.
That means that a person held in the air by another will be transported
only if the holder is completely supported. Flying creatures must not
be flying at the time of transport.

To cast the spell, the caster must stand in the center of an undamaged
Pattern and cast the spell. In the first round of the casting, the
Pattern will begin to glow (each colour of the Pattern will emit its
own colour). Over the next eight rounds, the Pattern brightness will
increase to approximately the same as outside on a sunny day. As the
last word of the spell is stated, the brightness of the Pattern doubles
and all completely supported objects/creatures are transported to the
destination Pattern.

If the destination Pattern is not available (see above), then the
transported objects/creatures are returned to the source Pattern after
one second (and the source Pattern's save is at -4). The source
Pattern is subjected to some heat and other energies in the course of
the transport. These energies cause the source Pattern to make a save
or be damaged (a single crack or burn mark will alter the Pattern and
render it unusable). The destination Pattern is not subjected to the
same amount of energy, so it does not need to make a saving throw.

The lighting conditions at the destination Pattern do not change, so
the transported creatures will have to adjust to the current lighting
(1-2 rounds, depending on lighting).

Some notes:

1) Tossing a rug over an inlaid Pattern prevents incoming transports.

2) Rolling up a rug/cloth Pattern prevents incoming and makes it easier
to transport the Pattern.

3) The only bi-directional Patterns are exactly the same size (hence
the Pattern Image spell).

4) The caster must remain in the middle for all of the casting, but
creatures/objects also transported only have to be on the Pattern in
the last segment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marty's Magic Bow (Evocation)

Range: 0 (arrow range as per normal bows)
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Marty's Magic Bow causes a magical force to propel objects from the
caster's fingers much as a bowstring. With arrows, the effect is to
allow the caster to release one arrow per round, each arrow attacking
as a fighter of 1/2 level of the spellcaster. The advantage of this
spell is the fact that the arrow attacks are not magical: thus there is
no magical saving throw involved for the target, so if the caster makes
his to-hit roll (at 1/2 his level on the fighter table) he hits, even
if the target is, say, in an anti-magic shell, or in a Cube of Force of
Keeps Out All Magic, or if the target is magic resistant.

There's probably a material component (say, a length of string made of
silver thread, or something like that) but the arrows are not
components - i.e. they're not consumed, and you might be able to
reclaim some of them. Also, magical arrows would provide the
appropriate bonuses to hit/damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merkridan's Misplayal (Alteration)

Range: 2"
Components: V, S
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One instrument
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes music emanating from a musical instrument to become
twisted and harsh. The musical notes effectively become interchanged.
The target instrument may be either magical or non-magical. Only
magical instruments gain a saving throw (as if the attack were magical
fire) to avoid the spell effects. If a bard is playing an affected
instrument, all bard abilities directly resulting from the playing of
his instrument are lost until the spell expires (or the bard uses a new
instrument). The spell has no effect on sounds from living creatures,
although it could effectively garble communication through instruments
(i.e., signaling drums). It only works on items which are emitting
music at any time while (or up to one round after) the spell is being
cast.

The origins and history of the spell Merkridan's Misplayal are
unknown. This spell was discovered in a lost laboratory complex on the
deserted island of Arremara.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Molten Ground (Alteration)

Range: 20 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2 feet per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes an area of the earth to bubble up molten lava in its
area of effect. After the caster spends one round casting, using up
material components of sulfur and lava rock, the spell begins. In the
first round the ground tremors slightly, and those not wearing heavy
feet covering such as metal boots can feel a slight warmth.

In the second round of the spell the heat becomes very pronounced, and
will ignite paper, cloth, and dry vegetation touching the ground. If
the people in the area of effect did not announce that they were moving
in this round, they are going to be injured.

In the third round the ground becomes molten lava, wooden furniture
bursts into flames, and metals with low melting points start to soften.
Anyone in the area of effect takes 3d6 damage, 2d6 this round only if
wearing thick shoes. In each additional round spent in the area of
effect a person takes 3d6 damage, and any items carried by the person
must safe vs. fire or be destroyed.

The intense heat of the lava may cause structural damage to walls that
are near or in the area of effect. Wooden walls will be destroyed by
fire just like wooden furniture. Protection from Fire will protect a
person but not his items from this spell. Note that lava rock is hard
to obtain in most medieval settings, and that the lava generated by
this spell will not work as a component for later casting (it's marked
by magic).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Necromantic Bolt (Necromancy)

Range: 60 yards + 10 per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses his hand
and then shoots forth, enerringly striking its target. This energy
attacks the life force of any living creature. The creature must roll a
successful save vs. spell or suffer 1d4 points of damage per level of
the caster and 1 point of strength per level of the caster. If the save
is successful, the creature remains unharmed. Creatures not rated for
strength suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls for every two caster
levels. Lost strength returns at a rate of 1 point per hour. Damage
must be cured magically or healed naturally over time.

This spell has a special effect on undead creatures. Undead struck by
the bolt suffer no damage or strength loss, but they must successfully
save vs. spell or flee for 1d4 rounds +2 rounds per level of the
caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pander's Improved Identify (Abjuration, Divination)

Range: 10 feet and 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One item per level
Saving Throw: Special

When Pander's Improved Identify is cast, magical items subsequently
touched by the wizard can be identified. The eight hours immediately
preceding the casting of the spell must be spent purifying the items
and removing influences that would corrupt and blur their magical
auras. If this period is interrupted, it must be begun again with a new
casting of the spell and the current spell is lost since this higher
level version requires intense concentration. When the spell is cast,
each item must be handled in turn by the wizard. Any consequences of
this handling fall fully upon the wizard and may end the spell,
although the wizard is allowed any applicable saving throw. However,
immediately before handling each item the caster may scan the items for
any cursed properties from a distance of 10 feet without touching the
item. The caster has a 5% chance per level of determining if there is a
curse and also the exact nature of the curse, to a maximum of 90%,
rolled by the DM. Each try is treated as one reading and the caster
need not use a slot to determine the exact nature of a curse unless he
wishes. This part of the divination can only detect curses, not traps.
It should be noted that the caster may not add to the list of original
items that were to be examined once this condition is established. If
the act of detecting for a curse actually triggers one that affects the
caster he may make a saving throw vs. spells to avoid the curse in
question.

The chance of learning a piece of information about an item is equal to
10% per level of the caster, to a maximum of 90%, rolled by the DM. Any
roll of 96-00 indicates a false reading (91-95 reveals nothing). Only
one function of a multi-function item is discovered per handling (i.e.,
a 5th level wizard could attempt to determine the nature of five
different items, five different functions or a single item, or any
combination of the two). If any attempt at reading fails, the caster
cannot learn any more about that item until he advances a level. Note
that some items, such as special magical tomes, cannot be identified
with this spell.

Exact attack or damage bonuses, charges of an item may be determined;
one per reading. A +1/+4 vs. undead longsword has two individual
functions.

After casting the spell and determining what can be learned from it,
the wizard loses 8 points of Constitution. He must rest for one hour to
recover each point of Constitution. If the 8-point loss drops the
spellcaster below a Constitution of 1, he falls unconscious.
Consciousness is not regained until full Constitution is restored,
which takes 24 hours (one point per three hours for unconscious
character).

The material components of this spell are a crushed pearl and jet gem-
stone (of at least 100 GP value each), and an owl feather steeped in
wine, with the infusion drunk prior to spellcasting. If a luckstone is
powdered and added to the infusion, the divination becomes much more
potent and the functions of a multi-function item can be learned from a
single reading. At the DM's option, certain properties of an artifact
or relic might also be learned.

The source of this spell is Pander Pillma.

Pobithakor's Tracer (Divination, Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell was created by an archmage known as Pobithakor the Powerful,
a mage who was better known as Pobithakor the Paranoid. His fear of
absolutely everything around him drove him to take extreme measures to
protect himself.

This spell is cast when the caster is being scried upon (DMG Detection
of Scrying, pg. 141).

If the caster detects that he is being scried upon, by any means, then
the spell can be cast. This spell causes the scrying device to become
two-way. Not only does the scrying creature see the caster, but the
caster can see the scrying creature. Also, whatever powers the scrying
device has, such as clairaudience, then the spell also gives the caster
such powers. The range and area of effect are those of the scrying
device itself. The duration is that of the scrying device. Once the
caster breaks off contact the spell ends. If the scrying creature
breaks off contact, the caster can still scry up to the maximum
duration of the scrying device. The caster will receive all the
information inside his head.

If the scrying creature becomes aware that he is being scried upon and
then casts a dispel magic, the spell will end, but his own scrying
device will become unusable for one day. If the scrying creature casts
a Pobithakor's Protection spell then the Pobithakor's tracer spell will
end and the creature's scrying device will be usable.

This spell can be a useful device for long range communication for
prearranged meetings between two people.

Protection from Chaos, 10 Foot Radius (Abjuration) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius sphere around creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level spell protection from chaos
(q.v.) except with respect to its area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rathe's Trigger (Conjuration)

Range: 3 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One cube foot per level maximum
Saving Throw: Special

The Trigger spell is designed as a defensive spell. When it is cast,
the caster defines a volume which must be at least 1/2 foot in every
dimension. This area begins to glow faintly. The caster then casts
another spell directly upon the Trigger's area. The Trigger's area of
effect must be touched by the caster when applying the second spell.
The glow then vanishes, but both spells remain. The second spell is
held by the Trigger until someone enters or touches the Trigger's area
of effect. At this time the second spell will go off.

If it is an area effect spell (e.g. Fireball, Web) it will be centered
on the center of the Trigger area. Other considerations (the dimensions
of the web, for instance) must be specified at the time of casting the
second spell. Person-affecting spells (e.g. hold person, charm person)
will be applied to the person who triggered the spell. A saving throw
is applicable only if allowed by the second spell. If the caster is in
or touching the Trigger's area of effect, it will not go off. This
allows the caster to escort others safely through the trapped area.

One possible use for this spell is two triggers overlaid in a corridor,
one with a Fireball, and the other, placed slightly behind the first,
with a wall of force. If a person enters the regions from the wrong
direction, the Fireball will go off, and the wall of force will
instantly restrict the blast to one direction. If a person enters the
regions from the other direction, the wall will trigger first and
shield him from the blast. The spells will last until triggered, but if
the second spell is not applied immediately, the trigger will only last
one turn per level of the caster. The material component is a black
pearl of not less than 500 GP value per level of the second spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reconstruct (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One pound per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell temporarily resurrects an item that was shattered, burnt, or
disintegrated, so that the forensic wizard may study it. He must gather
as much of the debris as possible, for otherwise the object can be but
partially reassembled, in which case it may be illegible or
unidentifiable. The object will be very fragile, but it may be the
subject of various divination spells such as identify or reveal owner.
The material component is a drop of honey.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Electricity (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the 2st level druidic
spell resist electricity (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Fire (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

Except as noted above, this spell is identical to the second level
clerical spell Resist Fire (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resist Paralysis (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the recipient is immune to all forms of
paralysis, including gaze attacks, paralytic poison, hold spells and
dragon induced fear paralysis.

This spell does not remove paralysis already in effect, it just
prevents the recipient from being paralysed in the future.

The material component of this spell is a feather, and an infusion of
tea and ginger which is consumed by the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Spellscan (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hours + 10 minutes per level
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: 10-yard per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Provided the caster is conscious and within the area of effect, he will
be made aware of any spell-casting conducted in that area.  The
particular spell cast is not made known, but the location of the wizard
is, precisely if the caster is familiar with the area, generally
otherwise.  The notification is sufficient to disrupt casting in
progress, unless it is consciously suppressed before casting (if
suppressed, caster does not realise the scan was triggered).  Material
component is a handful of crystal dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Golden Circles of Protection (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One floating 2' diameter circle plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering circular plates of force which
move around the caster in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
improved by a factor of 1 for every three circles still active and any
successful physical melee attack (less boulders, ballista, or attack
forms similar to dragon's belly flop maneuver) will be deflected
automatically. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective
strength of 21 or greater require a saving throw versus breath weapons
to deflect.

Each circle is able to sustain 6 hit points of damage before
disrupting, so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to
disrupt a circle (chosen randomly) the circle will remain active. For
every 5 circles active, the effects of breath weapons directed at the
caster will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with 1 hit point
damage per die being the maximum reduction allowable. Though, unless
the breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
circle it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of circles in the
process.

While the circles orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for every
circle active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including spells. The
mage may create fewer circles than the maximum possible. The material
component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for every circle
created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they disappear and
are replaced by the floating circles.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Snowball (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

A snowball is an explosive burst of cold gas, which comes into being
with a loud "whoosh" and delivers damage proportional to the level of
the mage who cast it, i.e. 1d6 per level of the spell caster. The
snowball doesn't expend a considerable amount of pressure, and it will
generally conform to the shape of the area in which it occurs, thus
covering an area equal to its normal spherical volume. [The area which
is covered by the snowball is a total volume of roughly 33000 cubic
feet].

Besides causing damage to the target, the snowball freezes all liquids
within its radius. Items exposed to the spell's effects must make a
saving throw to avoid being affected. Items with a creature which makes
its saving throw are considered to be unaffected. The mage points his
finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the snowball
is to come into being. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and
unless it impacts upon a material body prior to attaining the
predescribed range, blossoms into the snowball.

If creatures fail their saving throws, they all take full hit point
damage from the spell. Those who make their saving throw manage to
dodge, fall flat or roll aside, and thus take only half damage from the
effect of the spell. The material component of this spell is a hollow
crystal filled with water; suspended in the water are tiny white quartz
flakes. [cf. Fireball]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Magic Tracker (Divination)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to illuminate the tracks of any
being of which he has a some item that was in contact with the being a
number of turns equal to the caster's level previously. The item could
be anything from a shirt, to a scrap of hair, or drop of blood. The
tracks are only visible to the caster, and only tracks within the area
of effect are visible.

The spell only illuminates tracks within the spell's area of effect
(which moves with the caster), and will only illuminate tracks made on
a solid surface (i.e. if the being being tracked took to flight, or
dove into water, the trail would end there).  However, if the caster is
able to reach the spot where the trail was resumed (i.e. the being
being tracked wades out of a river at a certain spot), the caster may
resume tracking.

It is up to the caster to determine which direction leads to the most
recent tracks (i.e. which are coming and which are going), although the
spell does illuminate a "footprint" of the being which is being
tracked. The spell will allow the caster to track the being if it
climbed walls, and even if it tried to obscure its path, by throwing
dirt over it. Objects over 3" thick covering the path, however, do
obscure it.

The material component of the spell is some thing which had been in
contact with the creature to be tracked, up to the caster's level in
turns previously. Once the spell is cast, the caster need not carry the
item with him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Trance (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 10-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to mimic the actions of a creature,
provided the actions occurred within a number of turns equal to the
caster's level. During the casting of the spell, the caster must touch
some object which the target creature was in contact with for at least
a round, and that contact must not have occurred more than the caster's
level in hours previously.

Upon casting the spell, the caster goes into a trance, during which he
loses all control of his actions (save vs.  spells at -4 to break
spell), and begins mimicing the most recent actions of the target,
provided the actions occurred within the area of effect. The spell does
not allow the caster to mimic actions of which he is incapable, such as
climing walls, or broad jumping 20', and the caster merely imitates any
spells the target may have cast, and doesn't actually cast the spell
(although observers may recognise the spell he is attempting to cast).
If the target did something which would take it outside of the area of
effect, such as rapid movement beyond the abilities of the caster, or
teleportation, the spell is broken.

The caster must decide how far back in time he would like to begin
mimicing the actions of the target. The actions of the target may take
the caster beyond the original area of effect, but there is a 10'
radius sphere over which is determined whether or not the target left
the area of effect.

The caster has the option of casting such movement spells as fly and
feather fall, prior to Trance, to facilitate movement such as climbing,
and even flying, and to take the pain out of such actions as falling
(if the target was a clutz). The target must be man sized, and
humanoid.

The caster's trance will be broken by such things as damage, slapping,
and other unpleasant stimuli.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soul Safe (Abjuration, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell, the Necromancer stores the soul of the recipient in a
piece of jet, the material component. While his soul is thus protected,
a character suffers a penalty of -2 to attack rolls and saving throws,
he does not heal naturally, and magical healing functions on him at
only half normal efficacy. If the character is slain by undead while
under the effects of this spell, however, his soul cannot be corrupted
and forced to rise as undead itself (though the body can still be
animated as a zombie or skeleton). If the soul safe is destroyed, or if
the spell expires, the soul will return (across any distance) to its
body, unless that body is dead, in which case it will journey to its
final resting place. This spell affects only races with souls:
dwarves, halflings, and humans.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spirit Call (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This summons one incorporeal spirit of hit dice equal to one half the
caster's level from the astral plane. The round after it is summoned,
it will begin to perform services for the wizard. In its native form,
it is a powerful Unseen Servant which can go up to 100 yards from the
wizard, lift 50 pounds per hit die, and fly at 18". This form has a
punch for 1d6 damage, AC 0, and takes one point of damage from any
weapon blow.

Secondly, it may provide animating force to a body or statue, in which
case it uses whatever weapons or armour are available (a stone statue
will be AC 0, damage 2d6 or by weapon, move 9" unless affixed or
possessing wings).

Thirdly, it may attempt to take over the body of one enemy creature.
The being so affected is allowed a save, and the spirit will be forced
back to the astral plane immediately if the save is successful. If the
save fails, effects are as a Domination spell for the duration of the
Spirit Call, but the domination cannot force someone to use magic (the
Spirit would not understand the instructions). A spirit who has less
than 1/2 of its hit points left will be unable to possess someone.

The material component is a piece of candy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stren's Improved Floating Disk (Conjuration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an improved version of Tenser's Floating Disk. The big
improvement is the speed of the disk - now 30". The disk can also move
from 3' to 30' off the ground/water. The disk movement is based
relative to the caster, which prevents the caster from riding their own
disk. However, if two casters use this spell, they can ride each others
to travel. This travel can either be in the form of independent
movement (tricky to communicate since somebody else is steering yours)
or master-slave. In the master-slave travel, one caster steers a disk
while he rides on a disk which stays the same distance from its
caster.

S1 <---> S2 <---> M

Caster 1 is the master and riding in the back (caster 3's disk). Caster
2 is in the front riding on the master's disk - his own disk stays x
feet behind him. Caster 3 rides in the middle and his disk also stays
x feet behind him. Caster 1 steers the chain while the other two can
sleep, eat, cast spells, etc. I have this written down at home, but I
believe that all other parameters are the same as Tenser's Floating
Disk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suggest Illusion (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature per 3 levels of the caster
Saving Throw: Negates

This devious spell causes a targeted creatures to believe that they
have just discovered and successful disbelieved an illusion. This is a
bit of misdirection caused by the caster, as the item selected by the
caster to be believed as an illusion could actually be real.

This spell could be great for causing enemies of the caster to walk
into a pit because it "does not really exist".

If the victim has a reason to believe that a so called illusion is
actually not an illusion, then he get a saving throw vs. illusion to
actually determine if the item is an illusion or not.

The material component of this spell is a bit of burning incense, which
of course adds to a magical "atmosphere", thus making the victims
believe even harder that they are really seeing an illusion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

View Past (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: one hour
Area of Effect: 5-foot per level radius circle
Saving Throw: None

The spell is cast on an area, and allows the caster to create a
three-dimensional image of the past in that location. The caster
specifies the time in the past by the material component: one gold
piece equivalent of gold dust is used for each hour back that is
viewed. Thus if the caster uses 24 GP worth of dust, he can view a
period starting roughly 24 hours in the past through the duration of
the spell (a tenth level caster could view the period from 24 hours in
the past to 24 hours - 100 minutes, that is 22 hours and 20 minutes, in
the past).

After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 1d20 - 10 to determine the
error in the time frame. Thus if the DM rolls 5 - 10 = -5, the time
viewed is actually N hours and 5 minutes in the past; a roll of 10-10 =
0 indicates exactly the right amount of gold was consumed.

The caster should roll 1d20 to determine the clarity of the casting. A
1 indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a fog; a 20
indicates a crystal-clear picture. This roll can be repeated in
subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty of seeing through
time.

Events that were cloaked by spells that hide themselves from
Clairvoyance also mask out View Past, and can never be seen using this
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wimbly's Enwrapment (Alteration)

Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a little blob of a sticky, web-like material
flies toward it's target and completely wraps it in a very strong, very
sticky webs. The webs cannot be broken unless the target creature has
at least a 23 strength.

To determine if the blob hits, roll the attack as if the blob was a
monster of hit dice equal to the caster's level.

There are 3 applications of this spell: 1) As a glowing sigil drawn in
the air by the caster and pointed at the intended target; 2) As a glyph
marked on a surface that is touched or gazed upon; 3) As a small
character written on some magic work to protect it.

The material components of this spell are some strands of web that a
giant spider uses to bind up its captured prey.

Acid Spray (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone shaped spray of acid to
extend outwards from the casters hand. The length of the cone is 1/2"
per level of the caster and the cone terminates with a circular area
with a radius of 1/8" per level of the caster. The start of the cone is
a circular area of 1' radius.

The damage from the acid is 1d4 + 1 per level of the caster.

The material component of the spell is a vial of acid which is thrown
in the direction which the cone will go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alcoreax's Icetrail (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: See below
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates a wave of hardened ice which the caster actively
directs. After casting, the wizard simply taps the ground to activate
the spell. The wave of ice begins where the caster taps the ground,
and reaches its full dimensions after advancing only 10 feet. It
travels at a speed of 40 feet per round. The crest of the wave is 10
feet high and 15 feet wide; after the crest of the wave has passed, the
height of the remaining "trail" is only 3 feet high.

Creatures coming into contact with the crest suffer 2d6 points plus 1
point damage per level of the caster, or half this amount if the
creature is cold-using (in general, cold-dwelling creatures take half
damage from this spell, rounded down, and cannot suffocate as a result
of this spell). In addition, creatures of less than large size must
save against paralysation or be buried under the crest. Buried
individuals take an additional 1d3 points of cold damage each round and
must initially make another save against paralysation or start to
suffocate under the ice (use the rules for drowning). Trapped
creatures may break free, taking 1 more point of damage per level of
the caster from sharp ice.

The crest of the wave can be disrupted by 30 or more points of fire
damage, or negated by a wall of fire in any case. At the end of the
spell duration, the crest of the ice wave immediately loses all
momentum and melts; the spell will cause no more damage, and trapped
creatures can easily break free taking no damage. The material
components for this spell are a steel pin and a glass of icewater.

Alcoreax is the headmaster of Talarin Niulivius, one of the better
magical schools on the continent of Niulivia. Alcoreax's Icetrail is
the only spell he has researched. This one took him over five years to
develop.

Alpha's Acid Rainstorm (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 240 yards
Components: V, S, M
Durations: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 30' x 30' square
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell, which functions only out of doors, causes thin streams of
hissing violet acid to fall within its area of effect.  All within the
area must save vs. spells or suffer full damage.  The spell inflicts
1d8 per two levels of the caster (rounded up).  All exposed items in
the area must also save vs. acid or be destroyed.

Characters under heavy cover which is not destroyed by the acid are
fully shielded from the effects of the spell.  The acid, once it
strikes the ground, harmlessly disappears.  The material component for
the spell is a small vial of aqua regia and a strip of zinc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Acid Resistance (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell grants the subject complete immunity to acid, up to a
point.  The spell's basic duration is 10 rounds per level of the
caster.  However, for every point of acid damage that would have been
suffered by the character (after saving throws and any other
protections have been considered), the duration of this spell is
reduced by one round for every point of acid neutralised by the spell.
This spell also protects the subjects equipment from needing to make
any Item Saving Throws vs. acid for as long as the spell is in effect.
The material component is a small glass vial containing lye and water.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Ball Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The caster of this spell can create one to four spheres of glowing
electrical energy.  These spheres resemble Dancing Lights (q.v.), and
the caster can control them in the same way.  The spheres can be moved
up to 120' per round.  Each ball is about 5' in diameter, and any
creature(s) approaching within 5' will dissipate that ball's charge.  A
save vs. spells results in half damage, indicating that contact was
across an air gap.  Note that more than one creature approaching within
5' in a single round can be affected by the ball is that occurs.

The charge values are:

1 lightning ball	4d12
2 lightning balls	5d4 each
3 lightning balls	2d6 each
4 lightning balls	2d4 each

Alpha's Chill of the Void (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20' wide, 5' per level long path
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings forth a wave of supernatural cold, rolling forth from
the caster's outstretched arms to the maximum area of effect.  Its cold
vacuum kills all normal vegetation in the area except for trees, which
have a 50%-100% chance to survive (DM's discretion, based on size and
native environment).  This cold inflicts 3d4 damage and the vacuum an
additional 3d4 to all living creatures within the area of effect.
Vegetable and fungoid monsters suffer double damage from this spell.
The material component is a piece of ice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Elemental Form (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

Use of this spell enable the spellcaster to transform the matter of a
creature's body into the stuff of a particular elemental plane.  The
elemental form enables the character to engage in normal combat with an
elemental of the same or opposite form (i.e. water would allow combat
vs.  water or fire elementals), or an elemental creature, without
needing a magical weapon to hit.  It also provides protection vs. the
same element as if a ring of warmth (+2 on saves, -1 per die of damage,
regenerate 1 HP of elemental-caused damage per turn).  The subject can
also exist without danger on the appropriate elemental plane, and can
move normally there.  It does not empower the subject with perceptions
not normally possessed (e.g. seeing through the rock of elemental
earth), but it does prevent elemental damage.  A character possessing a
ring of elemental command who assumes Elemental Form of the same type
gains the cumulative effects of both, and IS empowered with senses on
the appropriate plane as if in normal air.

If this spell is cast on the prime material, the spell will last 1 turn
per level of the caster.  If cast on the appropriate elemental plane,
or in the border Ethereal of that plane, it will last 12 turns per
level.  If cast while on an elemental or para-elemental plane different
from the form assumed, start with the base of 12 turns per level and
halve the duration for each plane removed.  An Elemental Form in
opposition to the plane the caster is on (air vs. earth, fire vs.
water) cannot be assumed at all.

The material component is a small amount of the appropriate element on
hand (a handful of clay or earth or a torch flame will suffice).

Alpha's Firefall (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is an improved version of the 2nd level Pyrotechnics spell
(q.v.), specifically the "fireworks" application of that spell.  That
portion of the spell functions exactly as the Pyrotechnics spell does
with respect to duration, area of effect, saving throw, and the
blinding effect created.  However, the "fireworks" created by this
spell are more along the lines of a geyser of brightly burning liquid
fire, arcing upwards approximately 60' into the air and raining down
within a 30' area surrounding the perimeter of the basic fire source.
All in this area of effect suffer 2d6 fire damage with no saving throw
allowed.  Further, a central prominence of flame is thrown upwards by
this spell, and the caster may direct this column of fire at a single
target within 60' of the fire source.  This plume of fire will inflict
4d10 damage to the victim, although a saving throw vs. breath weapon is
possible to halve this damage.

The liquid fire continues to burn during the following round, under the
same conditions as during the first round, although the fire is less
intense and causes only half the damage caused during the first round.
Combustibles in the area of effect must save vs. normal fire (if struck
only by the burning spray) or magical fire (if the victim of the
central plume fails his saving throw or if the central plume is
directed at an inanimate object) to avoid being set afire.  A creature
who is within the area of the spray who is targeted by the central
plume will not also suffer fire damage from the spray, as this minor
flame is all but lost in the fury of the central prominence.  The spray
does not fall within the area of the original fire source, but only
within 30' of the perimeter of the fire source.  An aerial creature
flying within 60' above the rising geyser of liquid fire is affected
just as a creature on the ground would be, and may also be targeted
with the central plume, if the caster so desires.  The material
component for this spell is a lump of pitch mixed with sulfur,
saltpeter, and magnesium, as well as an existing fire source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Flames of Falroth (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures an extra-dimensional black flame to surround a
single object or creature within range.  This fire has exactly the
opposite effect of normal fire, in that it restores creatures or
objects burned to destruction by fire or acid to their original state.
This will not restore life to a person slain by a Fireball spell, but
it will restore the body to full health, such that a Raise Dead spell
will bring the character back to full physical health (though an amount
of time equal to the time dead must be spent recovering from the
psychological shock).  Similarly, it will not restore enchantment to a
once-destroyed magic item, though a Limited Wish spell is capable of
restoring the lost enchantment to the item reconstructed by the Flames
of Falroth.

In order to restore an item or creature, the target must fail a saving
throw of the same type that resulted in its destruction.  Hence, plate
mail destroyed by the breath of a black dragon must fail a saving throw
vs. acid, and an adventurer felled by a Fireball must fail a save vs.
spells.  For effects against which there is no save (e.g. Wall of
Fire), assume the save to be as against breath weapon for creatures or
magical fire for items.  It is thus more difficult to restore items
that were more difficult to destroy in the first place.  One such save
may be attempted each round, and as many saves as desired may be
attempted during the use of this spell.  No object can ever be affected
by this spell after the spell has been used on it once, whether or not
it was successful.  Once the save is failed, the object will take 2
rounds to be fully reconstructed from its remains.  The Flames of
Falroth may be moved to another object or creature at any time during
the spell's duration, with 1 round of concentration on the part of the
caster.

The Flames of Falroth are very hostile to ordinary fire.  They may be
used as a fire extinguisher or sorts, and will extinguish a 10' cube of
normal flame every round.  Magical fire spells must be checked as per
Dispel Magic, but multiplying the caster's level by 2 for the purposes
of determining whether the target spell has resisted the effects of the
Flames of Falroth.  If this Dispelling attempt is unsuccessful, the
Flames of Falroth will vanish back from whence they came.

If cast at an elemental fire creature of any sort, the Flames of
Falroth will automatically cause 6d6 damage to that creature.  After
this initial attack, the target creature may make a save vs. spell at
-3.  If successful, the Flames disappear without causing further harm.
If failed, however, the Flames continue to attack the creature's very
substance, causing 3d6 damage every round.  A new saving throw is
allowed each round, the chance to save improving by 1 each round (-2
after the second round, then -1, etc.).  This continues until the
creature is dead, the caster moves the flames away (after which time
that creature will no longer be affected by the Flames of Falroth), or
until the spell expires or a save is made--in both of these cases, the
Flames disappear.

A fire-using or dwelling creature that uses fire but is not native to
the Elemental Plane of Fire (e.g. fire giant, red dragon, chimera) will
not be harmed by the Flames of Falroth, but any external fire powers
(fire breath, spells, immolation, etc.) will cause only half normal
damage, as their effectiveness is mitigated by the Flames.  The
material component is a bit of green wood, a handful of ashes, a smoky
quartz crystal, and a piece of obsidian.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Hunting Pack (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons into the caster's vicinity a pack of canines who
will fight on behalf of the caster, if such is required.  The
composition of the pack will be as follows:

01-10	4-16 jackals
11-60	3-12 wild dogs
61-90	2-8 wolves
91-00	1-4 dire wolves

The pack will follow commands to the best of its ability, so long as
they are relatively simple (attack, return, heel, etc.).  If attacked
by the caster or his fellows, all creatures summoned will instantly
disappear.  The hounds can track as well as a 5th level ranger, and can
be commanded to perform this activity if it is requested of them (such
as by allowing them to smell an article of clothing from the creature
to be tracked, etc.).  The hounds will arrive 1-10 rounds after the
spell is cast.  The material components are a piece of fresh, uncooked
meat and a finely crafted silver or ivory hunting horn, worth not less
than 100 GP, which must be sounded during the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rainbow Blast (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' wide, 10' + 5' per level long beam
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is very much like the second level Rainbow Beam spell, but
is much more powerful.  Besides a slightly larger area of effect, and
the fact that a solid object will not stop the beam unless larger than
2' wide and formed of solid stone or some such similar dense material,
i.e.  the beam is not stopped by mere flesh, even if armoured, but
would be stopped by a stone wall.

The spell does 2-7 (1d6+1) points of damage per level of the caster.
The swirling, coruscating tendrils of multi-hued light also have
properties as listed under the Rainbow Beam spell.  A target resistant
to one or more of these forms of attack takes -1 point of damage per
die per attack that it is resistant to.  The obverse applies for
creatures that are particularly vulnerable to a certain form of attack
(e.g. a frost giant is immune to cold, but is not particularly
vulnerable to fire, so it would take -1 point of damage per die.  A
green slime, vulnerable only to fire and cold, would take -5 points of
damage per die.)  The indigo (holy water) beam does normal damage
except to creatures affected by unholy water (paladins, lammasu, etc.,
who are considered as being resistant), and those affected by holy
water (undead, demons, etc., who are considered as specifically
vulnerable).

The victim is entitled to a saving throw, which, if successful,
indicates that the beam has missed.  It may hit another target,
though.  Also, if a target is struck by the beam, he must save vs.
petrification or be struck in the face and blinded for 3-6 rounds.

The material component for this spell is a small diamond worth not less
than 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Ray of Paralysis (Alteration)

Range: 10' + 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

The caster extends his arm, points his finger, and speaks a word to
cast the spell.  A thin, light blue ray leaps from the caster's
finger.  The intended target must save vs. petrification.  If the save
is failed, then the creature is struck by the beam and, unless the
creature possesses some innate magic resistance, is paralysed for 2
rounds per level of the caster.  If the save is made, the pencil-thin
ray has missed its original target and continues on in a straight line
to the extent of its range.  Any creature in the path of the beam must
make the same saving throw or be struck and paralysed.  If the ray
actually strikes, there is no save vs.  its effects.  Size L creatures
must save at -1, size H at -2, and size G at -4.  Conversely, size S
creatures save at +1 and size T at +3.  The ray can affect only target
in any event.  The material component is a clear gem or a piece of
amber worth at least 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Shadowfire (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1' diameter, 5' per level long ray
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell calls forth a seething black ray shot through with veins of
green fire.  All creatures in the path of the spell will suffer d4
damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 20d4.  A successful
save vs.  breath weapon will result in only half damage.  A creature
that is immune to fire or to energy drain will suffer only one-half
damage (one-quarter if a successful save is made).  If the damage
rolled exceeds a target's remaining hit points, that target is
disintegrated.  The material component is a black opal worth at least
500 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Sheet Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10' per level square area
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a very bright flashing jolt of sheet lightning
within the area of effect.  All those in the area receive 4d4
electrical damage with no saving throw.  In addition, those within must
save vs. petrification to avoid being blinded for 1d3 rounds and must
save vs. breath weapon to avoid being stunned for 1d3 rounds.  Those
carrying large, mostly metallic weapons (e.g. swords, battle axes) or
wearing partial metal armour (studded-chain) save at -2 vs. the
stunning and suffer +1 per die of damage.  Those in full metal armour
(splint or better) save at -4 vs. the stunning and suffer double
damage.  The material component is a bit of fur and a sheet of fine
crystal worth at least 50 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bergil's Fire Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

The spell creates a powerful bolt of plasma that in inflicts 1d8 points
of damage per level to anyone in it's area of effect (maximum damage is
12d8). This bolt is 60' long by 5' wide, it cannot be forked. It
streaks outward much like a Lightning Bolt. It does not reflect,
however. If the Firebolt hits a wall the plasma spreads out in 5'
radius hemisphere, anyone in the hemisphere takes damage. Thus it is
possible to hit someone standing near a wall twice with the Firebolt,
once with the bolt and once with the hemisphere. The Firebolt
automatically sets fire to anything combustible in the path or in the
hemisphere. The bolt has the same penetration ability as a Lightning
Bolt. The material components are: a stick, a bit of sulfur, and a dab
of royal honey. All are consumed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Branit's Backstabbing Surprise (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None or 1/2

This spell provides protection against backstabbing. When the recipient
of the spell is backstabbed, a cloud of acid is created behind the
spell recipient which blows back and out to form a semi-sphere 8 feet
in radius. All within the area of effect, the recipient not included,
take 6d4 + 6 points of acid damage. Note that the backstabber gets no
save (due to surprise and proximity), all others receive half damage
upon successful save.

A backstabbing attack is any physical attack or combination of attacks
initiated from behind which causes damage equal to 1/5 or more of the
victims hit points at the time of the attack, assuming the attacker is
within 8 feet of the victim when the attack is initiated. The spell is
in effect until dispelled or discharged. This spell will work in
combination with other defensive spells.

The material component is 100 red ants which must be rolled in the
casters hands, the husks then thrown over each shoulder of the
recipient, and the juice rubbed into the recipients back.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Broom (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 hours + 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Broom touched
Saving Throw: None

A witch uses this spell to enchant her broom with the power of flight.
The broom flies with a movement rate of 30, minus 1 per 14 pounds above
182 pounds which it is carrying, and it can climb and turn at an angle
of 30 in response to the verbal command of its mistress. While the
enchantment lasts, the witch can summon the broom from up to 300 yards
away. The material components are a broom, which is not used up by the
casting, and a feather, which is. The long casting time is necessary to
set the command words, but if the spell is recast on an already
enchanted broom, it has a casting time of 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chaos Vision (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: 1" per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell offers some protection from teleport spells by constantly
shifting and shaping what an area looks like.  Thus a mage cannot use
information gathered previously to teleport to the effected area as the
surroundings will have seemingly changed.  Objects located in this
environment or entering it will be effected also, first appearing as
one object or animal and then shifting to another.

Another use found for this spell is as a trap.  Slimes, molds and other
creatures that don't need senses to attack can be placed in this
environment and effectively are invisible.

Any attacks on anything in the area of effect is hindered by a -4
modifier to hit.  Note that true seeing and similar magics that see
through illusions will likewise penetrate this one.  No damage will be
taken by being in the illusion. ( Unless from something else physical
also there of course! )  The main purpose is simply to constantly
conceal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cheffield's Kingly Feast (Alteration)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One person fed per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Cheffield's Major Feast except that it brings
into existence food and drink which is of extremely high quality. The
food is excellent and nourishing. The drink is rich and tasty. This
meal is truly fit for a king and his kind. In addition to the main meal
are appetisers to serve before and desserts to be eaten afterward.
Nobody who is being served by this spell will be unable to finish their
food.

The material components of this spell are rich spices (40 GP) and a
good quality wine (minimum 10 GP) which must be mixed together when the
spell is cast.

As a final note it must be pointed out that the four and twenty black
birds baked in a pie is an optional feature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continual Ambience (Alteration)

Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 6" radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the second level magic user spell Ambient
Light (q.v.), except as noted above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damian's Insulated Envelope (Abjuration)

Range: 0"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

Due to his personal dislike of lightning the archmage Damian crafted
this spell to specifically counter its harmful effects. When cast, this
spell seems to cover the caster in a pale blue light resembling an
envelope. Once cast the caster gains 2 Benefits (much like fire
shield).

1) A save vs. lightning at + 2 indicates no damage to the caster. A
failed save merely indicates Half damage. If at any time the caster is
hit by any acid or acid spell the caster must save normally or take
double damage.

2) If any melee attacks are made on the caster, on a successful strike
the caster takes normal Damage but so does the attacker.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deadthought (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This is essentially telepathy with a corpse, as the forensic wizard
probes the brain of the deceased for specific data. The dungeon master
must decide if the information sought is basic, well known, merely
known, or forgotten. The table below lists the chance of finding the
information and the amount of time required by the search (if location
is in fact possible), but the DM can altar these numbers if the body is
in a particularly advanced state of decomposition.

Type of		Chance of	Time
Information	Finding		Required	Examples
-----------	---------	------------	--------------------
Basic		96%		1 round		Name and profession
Well Known	70%		2-8 rounds	Relating to current
						mission
Known		30%		3-12 rounds	Relating to previous
						missions
Forgotten	2%		11-20 rounds	Overheard once

This spell will continue as long as the wizard concentrates, but on
every round there is a 1% chance of that he will go insane. The
material component is a pair of metal helmets, linked by a copper
wire.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deave (Alteration, Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a temporary sensory overload to occur in all the
sensory nerve endings of the target creature. Because of this overload
of all the senses (sight, smell, touch, taste, hearing) will be "burnt
out" for the duration of the spell. The creature will find himself in a
state of total sensory deprivation for the spells duration. This means
that the creature will not be able to see, hear, taste, feel or sell
anything. The creature will remain completely helpless for the
duration.

There is an additional side effect of this spell. Because the loss of
the senses can be so shocking an experience to some creatures, there is
a 1% chance per point of intelligence and wisdom that the creature will
suffer from the insanity of Catatonia for a duration of 2-8 weeks
afterward. This can be cured with a Cure Insanity.

If the creature makes its saving throw vs. spells, then the spell does
not completely take effect. Only 1 to 4 of the creatures senses are
affected (determined randomly). Note that some combination of lost
senses could leave the creature helpless anyway.

The material components for this spell are a small leather hoof, a
shrill whistle several sharp pins, smelling salts, and a drop of lemon
juice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deja Vu (Divination)

Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell throws the victim back to the location he occupied at a pont
in the recent past. It does not turn back time, it merely teleports
back along the victim's "time line." This restriction makes the
resistance that the magic must overcome much less than a full "teleport
other" spell would have to fight. Deja Vu sends the victim to the
position he occupied 1d6 hours in the past per level of the caster.

If the victim would be placed inside another object or creature, the
victim is placed in a random direction along his time line until an
unobstructed location is found. The material component is a
time-keeping device which is destroyed at the time the spell is
memorised by the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Spellcasting (Divination)

Range: 10-yard per level radius
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to scan a surrounding area for spells
being cast by other magic users. The affected area has a radius of 10
yards per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 200 yards); the
caster may make the area of effect smaller if he wishes. Any wizard
spells that are currently being cast, will be detected (priestly magic
is not affected). The caster is instantly aware of the school of magic
of all spells in this area; the name of the spell will also be known,
if it has already been learned by the caster; in addition, the caster
gains a general feeling of the location of the caster of each of the
spells (i.e. approximately 30 feet east).

The relative strength of two spells from the same school will also be
detected. For example, if a Meteor Swarm and a Burning Hands spell are
both being cast in the area of effect, this spell will detect which is
more powerful (this will also work for two Fireball spells cast by two
wizards of different levels); the actual level of the spell is not
revealed, and two spells of different schools cannot be compared in
this way.

The caster may choose one spell to target for specific information;
this includes: the name and level of the spell (as well as the caster's
level, if that is relevant to the strength of the spell), the spell's
target (object, location, creature, etc.), and the exact location of
the caster. Illusions of level 4 or less are revealed, as long as the
caster is of higher level than the caster of the illusion. Illusions of
level 5 or higher will return a false reading (i.e. what the caster
believes the spell to be) unless the caster has already disbelieved
that illusion.

This spell does not detect spells which are already in effect. It does
however detect all spells as they are cast, as long as the duration
lasts (i.e.  if this spell is cast by a 10th level wizard, it will
detect all spells that are cast in the following ten rounds).

This spell does have a drawback: the maximum number of spells that can
be processed safely is equal to the caster's intelligence divided by
three (round fractions down). If there are more than this number of
spells being cast inside the area of effect, the caster must make a
successful system shock roll or fall unconscious for 1d6 rounds (this
roll must be made every round this condition exists).

The material component for this spell is a powered gem worth at least
100 GP which must be tossed in the air when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Eldritch Shield (Abjuration)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell protects the recipient from any magic energy based attacks.
Each individual manifestation (e.g. magic missiles, eldritch spheres,
etc.) directed at the recipient is absorbed by the shield, whether or
not they successfully hit. The eldritch shield can withstand up to 1d4
+ 1 attack per three levels.

Note that regular attacks also reduce an eldritch shield without any
penalty, and the shield may only absorb spells which the caster has
sufficient levels to cast. (e.g. a 9 hit die eldritch shield can
protect from 5-8 magic missiles or similar spells, while a griffon
would take off three from the shield and still inflict normal damage).
The material component is sapphire and diamond dust which is sprinkled
upon the creature to be protected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Warding Shield (Abjuration)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The warding shield is a unique magical screen which encompasses one
creature and protects it from harm. The shield remains completely
invisible until struck by any attack, including weapons and spells
which cause direct damage. Then it then flares pale blue, absorbing
part or all of the attack (any damage which is not absorbed goes
directly to the character using the shield).

The warding shield may absorb up to base 1d4 HP damage + 2 points per
level of the caster. If a magic resistant creature attacks the spell's
host, then its resistance is checked first. Success indicates that the
shield is by- passed during that attack, and damage goes directly to
the person being protected. However, the shield remains intact until it
loses all hit points, gets dispelled, or until all hit points elapse,
at a rate of 1 hit die per turn. A person may have only one warding
shield at a time.

The material component is 50 GP worth of diamond dust which is thrown
into the air as the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eldarr's Flameshroud (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level (but see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the caster is enveloped in an invisible shroud
of flames; a True Seeing spell or similar magic will reveal the shroud,
and a Detect Magic will reveal strong lines of abjuration and evocation
magic. The spell imparts on the caster, the equivalent of fire
resistance for the duration of the spell (see description of ring of
fire resistance).

In addition to the protection aspect of this spell, the caster may also
use it offensively: any target that comes within 10 feet of the caster
may be attacked using the shroud; a small finger of (clearly visible)
flames shoots from the shroud and strikes the victim, inflicting 1d4
points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to a maximum
of 1d4 + 20). A successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by half.
Only one such attack may be made per round, and each attack reduces the
spell's duration by one round (thus, an attack may not be made the last
round the spell is in affect).

Anyone who scores a successful melee hit on the caster while he is
under the protection of this spell, suffers damage equal to that
inflicted by an attack from the shroud (1d4 + 1 per level); again, a
successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by one half. The duration
of the spell is not affected in this case.

The material component for this spell is any normal cape with a chunk
of sulphur placed in the pocket; the cape must be worn throughout the
duration of the spell; if it is removed, the spell ends prematurely.
The cape is not affected by the casting of this spell, but the sulphur
is consumed when the spell ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eldarr's Shockshroud (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level (but see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is nearly identical to Eldarr's Flameshroud; in covers the
caster in an invisible shroud of electricity; the shroud is detectable
by the same means covered in the Flameshroud description. This spell
provides the user with immunity to lightning and other electrical
attacks for the duration of the spell.

The caster may use the shroud to conduct electrical attacks in the same
manner as that for the Flameshroud spell; damage is identical, and each
attack reduces the duration by one round. The shroud will also provide
protection vs. melee attacks as per the Flameshroud, with electricity
again replacing flames.

In addition to the cape (which is not harmed), this spell requires a
specimen of any electricity-using creature, such as an electric eel;
this specimen is consumed when the spell ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enemy Blink (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 4d6 creatures
Saving Throw: Negates

Makes enemy blink if save failed. Otherwise like blink. Good for use if
enemy near cliff or large body of water. The number of creatures
affected is determined randomly, by rolling 4d6.

Cannot make people save twice, ie, "I've got 12, I use them all on him,
have him save 12 times".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flaming Water (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 10' per level radius area
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell will cause an area of water to instantly burst into flames
as if covered with oil and set alight. The center of the area of effect
may be as far away as 10 yards per level of the caster; the area of
burning water has a radius of 10 feet per level of the caster, but may
be smaller if the caster desires. The spell must be cast on an open
body of water, such as a lake, river, or ocean; it may not be cast at a
container of water on the person of an individual.

If the center of the area of effect is on the surface, the flames will
remain only on the surface; if the spell is cast underwater, the flames
will form a sphere (if the distance between the surface and the center
of the area of effect is less than 10' per level of the caster, the
flames will obviously not form a perfect sphere; in this case, the
surface of the water will burn as well).

The fire will last 2 rounds per level of the caster, or until
extinguished; the flames may not be doused with water, as this added
water will burn as well.  The fire must be extinguished by magical
means (i.e. dispelled or via a Fire Quench or similar magic), or
allowed to expire. If cast underwater, the duration of this spell is
halved.

The flames from this fire are sufficient enough to start ships on fire,
and any creature caught in the area of effect suffers 3d6 points of
damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (to a maximum of 3d6+20).
A successful save vs. spell reduces the damage by half. If this spell
is used to attack a water elemental or similar creature, the damage is
doubled, and there is a -4 penalty to the save.

The material components for this spell is a vial filled with a water
and oil mixture.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glamden's Mixer (Alteration)

Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One potion
Saving Throw: None

This spell requires the caster to have a potion of any type in his or
her possession. The potion is held in the caster's hand, and when the
spell is cast, the contents is instantly removed from its container and
reappears in a potion container in the target's possession. The DM then
makes a potion compatibility check (DMG 2ed. pg. 135) for the target
potion and applies the results normally. If the target has one or more
potion containers in sight, the caster may choose which one to affect.
If the target has no containers in sight, then one is affected
randomly; if the target has no potion containers in his possession,
then the spell has no effect. This will also work on a potion that is
just about to be quaffed, as long as the caster gains the initiative.

The only material component for this spell is the potion to be mixed
with the target's potion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hand of Time (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5-8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

After casting this spell, the death master's hand will bear a baneful
curse, for the next creature he touches (possibly requiring an attack
roll) will instantly become 4d10 years older. The spell lasts for one
round per level of the caster or until discharged, and it cannot be
reversed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Person II (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is like hold person except as noted above and that the
saving throw is made at -6.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hydro Shield (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the mage appears to be covered in a mist of
water. Variation A is coloured blue or green; variation B is coloured
violet or blue. Any creature striking the spell caster with body or
hand-held weapons will inflict normal damage upon the mage, but the
attacker will take double the damage so inflicted! The other powers of
this spell depend on the variation being used:

Version A: Any electrical attacks will be saved at +2 on the die, and
will do either half damage (if save is failed) or no damage at all (if
save is made). Acid based attacks are normal, but if the mage fails the
required saving throw, he sustains double damage! The material
component for this version is a bit of tree gum.

Version B: Any acid attacks will be saved at +2 on the die and will do
either half damage (on an unsuccessful save) or no damage (if save is
successful). Electrical attacks are normal, but if the mage fails to
make the required save he sustains double damage from that attack.

The material component for this version is an alkylaine substance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Illumine (Alteration)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One or more 10-foot radius globes (see below)
Saving Throw: Special

The Illumine spell acts as a multiple light spell. The wizard may
create two globes of light, with an additional globe per two levels of
experience of the wizard above the 7th. Immediately after casting, two
globes appear where the caster wills. The additional globes appear in
the following round. The wizard must spend that round specifying the
centers of spell effect, and may take no other action in that round or
all succeeding globes are lost. The caster may permanently dispel some
or all of the globes at any time during the duration of the spell. The
material component for the spell is one piece of phosphorescent moss
for each globe. In all respects other than the ones above, this spell
conforms to the restrictions of the light spell.

Illumine is the fourth of six spells researched by the mage Auralon
Deathrin in his lifetime. It was developed as a partial solution to
the annually increasing crime rate in the capital of Travinthia. (They
make good streetlights with some form of spell extension!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Magic Mouth (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: None

Like Magic Mouth but can speak command words to activate magical items,
Stash spells etc. (but can not cast spells).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Independent Spectral Hand (Necromancy)

Range: 30 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One opponent
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a ghostly, glowing hand, shaped from the caster's
life force, to materialise within the spell range and move as the
caster desires. Any touch attack spell of 6th level or less that is
subsequently cast by the wizard can be delivered by the spectral hand
The spell attacks as the caster at a +2 bonus to hit. The caster may
perform other actions. The hand is AC -3 and may be hit by magic only.
Any damage dispels it and does 1d6 points to the caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inertia (Alteration)

Range: 20 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the caster to freeze one creature or object up to 100
pounds per level, limit regardless of orientation. Creatures flying
through the air would be frozen in place (remaining in the air),
immovable until the second command word. The caster is free to cast
this spell upon himself.  If the subject of the spell is unwilling, it
receives a saving throw vs. magic, a successful save negating.

The caster must point at the creature or object to be stopped, and
utters the first command word. If the spell is successful (guaranteed
in the case of objects within the caster's weight limit), the item is
frozen in the air, immovable, unless a dispel magic, or other such
spell is cast, or until the caster utters the second command word. Upon
saying the second command word, the object or creature resumes its
initial motion. For example, cast upon a falling chest, would stop the
chest in the air. Upon the second command, the chest would resume
falling, even if someone had climbed on top of it. If some poor slob
happened to be standing directly beneath the chest at the time of the
second command... If cast at a knight on a horse, for example, the
caster must specify mount or rider. If cast at the mount, the rider
would probably continue in his original direction, just without his
mount. Cast on the rider, he would stay hanging in the air, as his
mount ran away.

Physical force is insufficient to move frozen objects, so they could,
for example, be used as anchors for ropes, etc. The caster must be able
to see the majority of the object of the spell, so he couldn't, for
example, cast it upon something in somebody's backpack.

The material component of the spell is a silver whistle, which is blown
prior to shouting the command word.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Greased Pig (Alteration, Conjuration)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature + 1 creature per 4 levels of the caster
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is a more powerful version of the third-level Haste spell,
with the first-level Grease spell thrown in too.  The people that the
spell is cast upon suffer none of the side effects of the grease (i.e.
they don't drop their weapons, they don't slip, etc.) but those that
try to attack or grab them will.  It negates special attacks by
creatures that inflict damage automatically every round after a
successful hit (i.e. stirges or executioner's hoods) - the creature
must roll to hit every round due to the slipperiness of the target.
Otherwise, it conforms to the normal Haste spell ( -2 on initiative,
double movement rate, double number of attacks per round, ages
recipient 1 year).  It is not cumulative with Haste or other Greased
Pig spells.

The material components for this spell are a bit of butter and an anise
seed for each recipient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Headless Flying Roasted Pig (Enchantment, Summoning)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell summons a pre-prepared headless flying roasted pig. The pig
flies at a rate of 30, and is under the control of the caster (who must
give it his full attention).  The pig is magically funny; anyone who
looks at the pig (except the caster) must save vs. spell every round
that the pig is in his field of view or fall down laughing until the
pig leaves.  Laughing victims are at a -2 "to hit" until the spell
expires.

Victims with an intelligence of 4 or less, that are meat-eaters, will
be attracted to the pig's delicious aroma and must save at a -6 or
spend the rest of the spell's duration trying to catch it.  If they are
vegetarians, they are unaffected.  Those with Intelligences of 5-9 save
vs. the laughter effect at a -4.  Those with Intelligences of 10-14
save at a -2.  Those with Intelligences of 15-19 save normally, and
those who are more intelligent than that are unaffected.

The pig cannot be caught or attacked; those attempting to do so
automatically succumb to the laughter.  The pig has no other attacks
besides its magical nature.  It can be Banished or Abjured; Dispel
Magic merely terminates the caster's control over it.  If the Dispel
Magic is successful, the pig will leave 50% of the time and stay 50% of
the time, the magical laughter effect will not be dispelled, and the
caster will become vulnerable to the laughter's effects.

The material components are a baked, spiced apple and a hummingbird
feather.  Additionally, a pig of no less than 50 pounds must be
beheaded, roasted and otherwise prepared ahead of time; this pig does
not have to be carried with the spellcaster but must not be eaten, as
it is consumed by the spell at the time of casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Morning After (Alteration, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1d6 rounds per level (see below)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One intelligent creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell takes effect after the victim has had a minimum of two hours
of sleep.  The victim loses all memory of events that occurred between
the time the spell was cast and when he awoke.

The victim will remember the existence of any material components used
in the spell.

The effects of the spell last 1d6 rounds per level of the caster.  The
caster should not be told the duration of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jibril's Anti-Magic Shield (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One mage per three levels
Saving Throw: None

The recipients of this spell are made more aware of the magic around
them and are also more able to affect it. They therefore have a magic
resistance of 5% per level of the caster.  A dispel magic is only half
as likely to dispel this spell.  Note: this spell only effects Mages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin's Mental Map (Divination)

Range: 1 mile
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Area of Effect: 1-mile radius area
Saving Throw: None

Outdoors only, this spell gives the caster an aerial view of the
countryside within 1 mile of the caster.  Only large features visible
from above are noted, like rivers, woods, fields, large buildings, and
clearings, but not people, caves, small streams, or the like. Material
component is powdered pineal gland.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mimic (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 10 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell forces some humanoid creature in the caster's line of sight
to begin mimicing his actions. The creature's actions will directly
reflect those of the caster, regardless of position or orientation. The
creature will be frozen momentarily at the onset of the spell, but
after that segment of inaction, the creature begins mimicing the
caster.

This can be potentially harmful for the target, if say for example, the
caster waves his hand in the vicinity of his neck, and the target
happens to be wielding a sword.

Once the spell is cast, the caster need not be able to see the target
for the target to mimic his actions. The target does get a second save
if forced to do actions that are obviously lethal, such as the
aforementioned hand waving example. If the target passes outside of the
range of the spell, the spell is broken.

The material component of the spell is a small ivory figurine, which is
broken to bits in the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missile Multiplication I (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1/5 round
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One missile
Saving Throw: None

A missile must be fired within the next twelve seconds. This spell
makes 3-18 missiles out of one. Only normal missiles are affected.

The stuff disappears one round after shooting, but their effects stay.
A nasty assassin in my game used the fifth-level version of this spell
with sleep-poison darts to capture a PC.

You have to roll to hit for each missile, by the way. However, if your
first missile hits, you have a +3 on all thereafter.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Backlash (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster is surrounded by an invisible shell
of energy; this shell is invisible to the naked eye, but a True Seeing
spell or similar magic will reveal it, and a Detect Magic spell will
detect strong lines of abjuration magic with weaker evocation lines.
While under the protection of this spell, if the caster is hit in
melee, the shell will emit a burst of pure energy that lashes out at
the attacker. The energy will inflict an identical amount of damage as
that inflicted on the caster by the melee attack (the caster still
receives normal damage). If the attacker makes a successful save vs.
spells, he will only suffer half damage. The shell will continue to
emit energy bursts on attackers as long as the spell's duration lasts,
or until the shell is dispelled.

The material component for this spell is a small, metal shield and a
gem worth at least 400 GP. Both components are destroyed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Negative Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 2" + 1/3" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This combat spell projects a bolt of negative energy. Some
practitioners believe it to be merely energy from the negative material
plane... Said Spellcasters are wrong. The spell actually projects raw
anti-matter in a bolt of anti-energy. Materials affected by the bolt
tend to disintegrate and be consumed... Spell wards and defences tend
to dissolve also. Specific defences exist for the genre of spells
similar to this one but they are secrets kept for self-defence.

The bolt only does 1d3 per level of the caster but it also has the
effect of dispelling first and second level defensive spells. Spells
third through fifth need to make a saving throw based on that of their
caster to save and sixth level spells only fail on a 1. Though the
duration of any such affected spell is usually reduced on a ratio to
the level of the spell (GM decision as to what, though I wouldn't
suggest more than 1/2 duration).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pander's Whirlwind Travel (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None or special

This spell encapsulates the caster and possibly more people and/or
equipment inside a conjured whirlwind. One of two variations of this
spell may be cast without prior preparation at the option of the
caster.

The first variation is used by the caster for personal transportation
or protection. While encapsulated in the whirlwind's eye the wizard can
view the outside normally and cause the whirlwind to travel over any
relative continuous surface with short hops over ditches or small
obstacles not over 4 feet in height being possible. The caster may not
carry more than his normal encumbrance and all equipment must be on his
person (exceeding this limit causes the whirlwind to fizzle). No other
creature may occupy the whirlwind unless it is carried. On solid ground
the whirlwind can move up to 24" + 1" per level above 5th level. Rate
of movement is the same whether moving uphill, downhill, or on stairs.
Over loose sand or marsh the movement rate is 2/3 of normal and over
water the movement rate is 1/2 of normal. Wind velocities can affect
the rate of speed. Although the caster may cast any spell from within
the eye, none will breach the barrier of the winds and spells such as
Magic Missile, Fireball, or Lightning Bolt will bounce back towards the
caster, possibly ruining an otherwise fine day.

This variation's duration is 1 turn per level and can be turned on and
off any time during the duration. It takes 5 segments to turn the winds
on or off (a good mage would calculate a spell so that it goes off the
segment after the whirlwind stops). The mage is still susceptible to
outside damage from spells, but only takes 1/2 or no damage if saving
throws are made while inside the whirlwind. Projectiles of a small
nature will not penetrate the winds and the mage's Armour Class and
saving throws vs. dodging have a +4 bonus while inside the eye of the
whirlwind.

The second variation is not as fast and cannot be turned on and off (it
is only good for a one-way trip). But, its area of effect is a 20-foot
diameter column which is 10 feet high (centered on the caster) and it
can carry along anything in the area of effect on a relatively safe
ride over long distances. Movement conforms as above but the base rate
is 12" + 1" per level of the spellcaster over 5th level and the
duration is 1 hour per level. All spells cast from inside conform as
above, as do effects of area spells cast at the whirlwind. All inside
have a +4 Armour Class bonus since they cannot be seen but there are no
dodging bonuses and saves vs. dodging are based on the caster for the
entire group. Weight is not a factor when determining what is picked up
for the ride. Anything not securely rooted to the ground will be picked
up. Once started, the winds may only be exited or penetrated after
startup by making a successful saving throw vs. spell at a penalty of
-1 for every two levels of the caster, rounded down. Flying creatures
who enter or exit from the top have no penalty on their save. Creatures
larger than the area of effect will simply push the whirlwind away if
they try to enter it. The caster may stop the winds at any time.

The material component of this spell is a piper's flute which is played
to bring the whirlwind from the elemental plane of Air.

The source of this spell is Pander Pillma.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pobithakor's Alarm (Divination) Reversible

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None

This spell, when cast, will detect and instantly alert the caster
whenever the caster is the subject of information gathering spells or
divination spells such as ESP or know alignment. The caster will have a
general idea of what is being used (mind reading, truth detection,
etc.) upon him.

The reverse of the spell will cause the caster to have no chance to
discover that such spells are being used upon him, i.e. the caster
would not be able to detect someone scrying upon him.

The material components of the spell is an eye from a very keen eyed
creature such as a hawk or a dragon. The reverse of the spell requires
that the eye be punctured.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Protection from Domination (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell protects the effected creature from all sorts of domination
attacks. This includes psionics and spells which do domination.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rathe's Mage Lock (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One portal
Saving Throw: None

The Mage Lock spell is an advanced form of the Wizard Lock spell. There
are two main changes from the latter. First, while the spell is in
effect, the portal cannot be damaged or destroyed by any physical (not
magical) means short of an elemental. Note, however, that magical means
of destroying the door (e.g. Fireball, disintegrate, etc) still work as
normal, and if the door is destroyed, the spell is broken. If the spell
is dispelled or negated by any means whatsoever (even temporarily), the
portal will crumble into dust.

Second, the spell has another application; it can be placed upon an
object. The effect of this is to allow anyone wearing or carrying the
object to open any Mage Locks by the same caster. For example, if one
of Rathe's Mage Locked bracelets was worn, the wearer could open any
door Mage Locked by Rathe (but not by any other mage). The material
component is half a pound of iron filings for the first application and
100 GP worth of diamond dust for the second.

Resist Acid (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the third level mage spell resist electricity
(q.v.), except this spell provides some protection from acid and acid
based attacks. The material component for this spell is an alkylaine
substance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Counter-Scry (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 20-yard radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

The caster will automatically detect any scrying attempt in the area of
effect.  The scryer must make a save vs. spells to realise that the
scrying is being tampered with.  If he does not immediately terminate
the scrying, the caster of the counter-scry gets a clear image of the
spy and a general location.  He can cast any ranged spells through the
link at the scryer, who receives all normal saves.  The caster of the
counter-scry can also simply jolt the scryer, causing the connection to
be terminated.  The detection of a scrying attempt will interrupt
spell-casting.  (It is suggested that "detect scrying" be made a second
level spell, with a more limited duration and vaguer description of the
scryer.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Tracker (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature or object
Saving Throw: Negates

The mage casts this spell, and hurls a small carved scarab at a target
within range.  A creature or object in a creature's possession gets a
save to avoid the scarab. It clings invisibly to its victim, noticed
only in a determined search.  The caster then always knows where the
victim is (distance & direction), provided it is within one mile per
level, and the target is not enclosed in lead.  The tracker can be
renewed each morning by recasting the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Golden Triangles of Protection (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One floating 2' high triangle plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering triangular plates of force which
move around the caster in a constant motion, deflecting any missile,
hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The AC of the mage is
improved by a factor of 1 for every three circles still active and any
successful physical melee attack (including boulders, ballista, or
attack forms similar to dragon's belly flop maneuver) will be deflected
automatically. Deflected creatures of large-size (or higher) who are
deflected must still land somewhere, possibly injuring friend or foe.
Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective strength of 23 or
greater require a saving throw versus breath weapons to deflect.

Each triangle is able to sustain 8 hit points of damage before
disrupting, so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to
disrupt a triangle (chosen randomly) the triangle will remain active.
For every 5 triangles active, the effects of breath weapons directed at
the caster will be reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with total
protection from breath attacks becoming a possibility, though, unless
the breath weapon causes less damage than the current hit points of a
triangle it will assuredly disrupt the entire field of triangles in the
process.

While the triangles orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for
every triangle active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including
spells. The mage may create fewer triangles than the maximum possible.
The material component(s) of this spell is a single gold piece for
every triangle created. All pieces are thrown into the air where they
disappear and are replaced by the floating triangles.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Sarius' Mage Ward (Enchantment, Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One amulet
Saving Throw: None

This spell is used to create a magical amulet which, when worn or
possessed by a creature, will cause all spells cast by the amulet's
creator to affect the creature with different variables of power. All
defensive or beneficial spells will have a +2 (on any applicable die or
10% if a percentage die) bonus applied to durations, areas of effect,
ranges, or any increases in which the bonus would benefit the creature.
All attack or detrimental spells from the mage would apply with a -2
(or -10%) penalty applied to their operation against the creature. For
example, if the mage accidentally caught an ally (in possession of his
Mage Ward) in the area of effect of his Fireball the creature would
have his needed save reduced by 2 and all damage dice against the
creature would suffer a -2 penalty, possibly negating the effect on
that creature.

Also, having the amulet in their possession (knowingly or unknowingly,
but not forcibly against their will) a creature's base magic resistance
will automatically be reduced by 2% per level of the mage (at the time
of the wards creation). Possession is considered to be within 2 inches
of the creature's body.

The amulet may also be used to negate any portal or device protections
created or cast by the mage for a one round period. After 10 uses of
this nature the amulet crumbles to dust. The material component of this
spell is 10 GP weight of platinum, and a special mold made of wax and a
crushed sapphire worth at least 500 GP. Once molten, the platinum is
poured into the mold and then the spell is cast on the cooling metal.
Note that the amulet does not have to be any certain shape, and can
later have gems (whether magical or not) mounted into it through
shaping and/or settings made at the time of molding, but the amulet
must not be injured by this or one 1-7 of the charges will be used.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow Wall (Abjuration, Conjuration)

Range: 1 yard per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly like Astral Wall, except that it additionally
forbids magical or mystical sensing through the wall. Thus,
clairvoyance, detect spells, mystical detection abilities, a basilisk's
gaze, etc. will not be able to pass through a shadow wall. Other
effects (including the duration increase) are as Astral Wall. The
material component is a piece of paper with a Blindness Glyph of
Warding or Symbol inscribed thereupon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Dragon Wings (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster conjures a shadowy pair of dragon
wings that appear on his body; these wings provide the caster with the
movement (flying) rate of the dragon that produced the material
component. For example, if the material component was taken from a blue
dragon, the caster would be able to fly at a rate of 30 with an MC of
C. The colour of the wings' scales will also correspond to the
appropriate type. The wings will last for 2 rounds per level of the
caster, or until dispelled.

The material component for this spell is the wing muscle from any type
of dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sleep II (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 60 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the first level sleep except as noted. All
creatures to be effected by the sleep spell must be within the 40'
radius sphere created upon completion of casting. The sphere must be
centered on a creature or object within sight and not an area; in
addition the area of effect can not be reduced, although the caster can
specify during its casting that creatures closest to the center be
effected first dependent upon the hit dice of those creatures.

The number of creatures that can be effected is a function of the
caster's level: for every 2 levels of the caster, 1d6 hit dice, rounded
up, can be effected. Example: A fifth level wizard could affect 3d6 hit
dice of monsters. Monsters with 6 + 1 hit dice or more are uneffected.
The center of effect is determined by the caster although the caster
may not be in the area of effect upon spell completion or risk its
effects. The creatures with the least hit dice are affected first
(dependent upon the casters wishes, additionally creatures below a
certain hit dice may be excluded), and partial effects are ignored.
The material components for this spell is a pinch of fine sand and rose
pedals, or a live cricket.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Animal Awareness (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One animal
Saving Throw: Negates

With this spell, the caster is able to take control any any small (size
Tiny) creature of less than 1+ HD in his line of sight. If the creature
is above animal intelligence, it gets a saving throw versus spells, a
successful save indicating spell failure. The creature is at -4 to save
if the caster has a good grip on it for the duration of the spells
casting. Those creatures of a non-magical nature of less then animal
intelligence do not get a save. Those of a magical nature get a save at
-4.

Once the caster has control of the animal, while concentrating he can
see, hear, etc through the animal's senses. He can also control the
animal's actions, even special movement, such as flying, swimming and
burrowing, although the if the caster attempts to get the creature to
attack something not below itself on the food chain, the animal has a
(75 - minus caster's level) percent chance of escaping the grip of the
spell. While concentrating on the animal, the caster is incapable of
any other action.

The caster can maintain control of the animal up to 100 yards away, per
level of the caster. Those seeing the controlled animal will notice any
strange behaviour it may be exhibiting, if they make the appropriate
perception checks (i.e. INT check, or save versus paralysation). The
spell is broken if the caster ceases concentration, or if the animal
takes more than 4 HP of damage. Otherwise, the spell lasts for a turn
per three levels of the caster (i.e. two turns at fourth, three at
seventh, etc).

The material component of the spell is a bit of food, which the target
animal would find appetising, which is consumed by the caster in the
casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Fly on the Wall (Divination, Necromancy)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a spying device out of an ordinary flying insect.
Upon casting the spell upon an insect, living or dead, the spell grants
the abilities of limited clairaudience and clairvoyance, centered on
the insect.  The mage, while concentrating on the insect, can hear any
noise within 15' of the insect. Clairvoyance through the insect,
however, is rather disorientating, and the mage is -2 to hit and AC for
three rounds after breaking concentration. The insect has a flying
movement rate of 6", and its movement is controlled by the
concentrating mage.

If concentration is broken before the end of the spell duration, the
fly drops to the ground, and there is a 75% chance that, if the mage
resumes concentration, it will be too damaged to fly again, although
the clairaudience and clairvoyance will still work for the remainder of
the duration. If the fly takes any damage during the spell, such as
being swatted or stepped on, the insect will no longer fly, but,
provided that at least half of the fly remains, the clairaudience and
clairvoyance will still work.

The material component of the spell is the body of a winged insect,
living or dead, which is slain in the casting of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Spying Minions (Conjuration/Summoning, Divination)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons minor etherlings from the Ethereal Plane, to serve
the caster's wishes. Etherlings, being rather stupid and weak, are only
suited for simple tasks, such as spying. Upon summoning the creatures,
the caster must detail, in simple language, what he service he wishes
the etherlings to perform. The etherlings, in their stupidity, will be
honoured by the request for service, and will perform the task to the
best of their abilities and comprehension.

A minor etherling (AC:2 MV:60 HD:2 #AT:1 D:1-3), is a small, vaguely
humanoid appearing creature, formed of the stuff of the plane ethereal.
On the prime material plane, it appears as a hazy, humanoid- shape
ghostly apparition, about 3' tall. It moves by flying, and is
unobstructed by walls and solid objects, save lead, the touch of which
sends it back to the ethereal plane. It is fairly stupid (INT: 5),
although extremely talkative, and puppyish in its affection of the
caster. The etherling will do its best to please the caster, to the
point of becoming annoying. It does have some special abilities, making
it particularly useful, however. It has a photographic memory, and will
never forget what it saw and heard during its period of service. It
also has the ability to turn small objects (one at a time), weighing
less than five pounds, ethereal, allowing it to transport the item. It
can also turn itself invisible at will, although those able to see onto
the ethereal plane will be able to see it clearly. It can push its
movement rate up to 120, for up to a turn at a time. It can only attack
things on the ethereal plane, and even there not very effectively.
Finally, the fact that it only partially exists on the Prime Material
plane during the spell means that it is only hit by magic weapons, and
spells.

The spell summons one etherling per three levels of the caster, one at
first, two at fourth, three at seventh, etc. The caster can detail
separate task for each individual etherling summoned, and may cast the
spell more than once during its duration (allowing him to summon a
virtual horde), as the spell requires no concentration after the
initial casting.  An etherlings instructions can be facilitated by
pictures (as in "Follow this *point* man... The one in the painting" or
"Follow her *point*... The one in this Phantasmal Force"). It is up to
the DM to decide the chance of the etherling getting confused, and
screwing up the task. I suggest that it has a 100% chance of getting
the task right, -1% for each word in the description (i.e. 10 words,
70% chance), giving a bonus for things such as pictures, and other
helpful examples.  If the etherling should encounter any mentally
straining problems, such as if its "mark" (he whom it is tailing or
spying upon) teleports away, or disguises its features, casts
illusions, etc, make an intelligence check for the etherling, modified
by the situation. If the etherling fails, it is hopelessly confused,
and returns to the Ethereal plane. The caster must take care to give
the etherling tasks which it can complete within the duration of the
spell, as the etherling returns to the Ethereal Plane at the end of the
spells duration.

Some examples of tasks given to etherlings would be "Go to the chamber
at the end of the hall, stay there, and return to me in 20 minutes, to
tell me what you heard and saw.", or "Go to this room in the tower of
the castle, and bring me back a book that looks like this...", or "Find
this man, follow him for half an hour, and return to me, telling me
what you witnessed.", or "Find this man, and tell him 'Va banque. The
game is thick' ", and similar such things.  Etherlings are intelligent
enough to follow the spirit of the commands, provided they are simple
enough.  Etherlings have an innate sense of direction, and will not get
lost on the Prime Material plane. They have the mentalities of young
children.  They will only perform service on the material plane.

The material components of the spell are small figurines, one for each
etherling to be summoned. They must be fairly detailed, and are
consumed in the casting of the spell.

Spirit Skill (Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Person touched
Saving Throw: None

This spell transfers skills from a specially prepared vessel into a
willing recipient. The material component is a symbol prepared using
Steal Skill, which must be carried by the recipient and disappears upon
completion of the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steal Skill (Conjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell lets a wizard steal the class-related skills of a willing
humanoid victim and transfer them either to the wizard or to a special
container. The victim drops to first level, and regains levels at the
rate of 1 per four hours thereafter. The caster gains 1/2 the
class-related skills of the victim (if stealing from a fighter, the
caster will gain the ability to wear armour and attack with a THAC0
halfway between the fighter's and the default 20 with any weapon with
which the fighter is proficient; if stealing from a thief the caster
will gain thief abilities which are the average of the thief's
abilities and the base of 4; in no case will abilities go down because
of this). Abilities which are granted by a diety cannot be transferred
this way, nor can spellcasting abilities. The transferred abilities
fade after one turn per level.

The material component is a symbol of the class to be transferred,
specially prepared and costing not less than 10 GP per level of the
target. If the caster wishes, he may imbue the symbol with these skills
rather than using them at the time (in which case it will not
disappear). The primary purpose of this use is to provide the material
component for Spirit Skill.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suppress Magic Resistance (Abjuration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One source of magic resistance
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster can temporarily suppress the magic
resistance emanating from one creature or object, thus allowing other
spells and magical effects to have an increased chance of effect. The
spell affects one creature or object and the area that its magic
resistance protects. For example, this spell can be cast a paladin
wielding a holy sword that provides magic resistance in a 5' radius,
and the magic resistance can be suppressed in the entire area of
effect. If there are multiple sources of magic resistance affecting the
same area, this spell may only target one of them.

This spell can suppress up to 5% magic resistance per level of the
caster. Partial effects are possible. For example, if a 10th level
mage is casting the spell at a creature with 80% magic resistance, that
creature's magic resistance will be lowered to 30% while this spell is
in effect. Of course, this spell will not go into effect unless the
creature fails its magic resistance roll.

The caster must maintain some concentration in order to preserve the
spell's effect. The caster may not perform any actions except moving at
up to half his normal movement rate. If the caster is successfully
attacked, then his concentration is also broken. If concentration is
broken, the spell's effects terminate immediately.

The caster, however, may choose to terminate the spell in a controlled
manner, and during the last round before the spell is terminated, the
spellcaster, in addition to moving at up to half his normal movement
rate, may also cast one spell whose casting time is up to one round.
The target's magic resistance remains lowered when making its
resistance check against this spell. Of course, other spellcasters and
devices may also cast spells while the target's magic resistance is
lowered, and such magic does not terminate the suppress magic
resistance spell.

This spell will totally negate a magic resistance spell if it is
successful at suppressing magic resistance of a percentage at least as
high as the percentage given by the magic resistance spell. In such a
case, concentration by the caster is not necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Trace (Divination)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: S
Duration: 10 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

The wizard casts this spell on a character or creature who is likely to
teleport or employ similar magic in the near future. If the recipient
does cast teleport (or dimension door, word of recall, etc.), then the
wizard who placed the teleport trace will receive a mental image of the
target location. The caster of the trace will then know his location
relative to that of the teleporter, and he will be able to use his own
teleportation or scrying magic with maximum accuracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Time Warp (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature per level
Saving Throw: Special

This is a combined haste and slow spell. At the time of casting, the
caster chooses which application to use. The effects, as well as range,
saving throw, and material components are as per the appropriate
spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Conjured Fireball (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell duplicates the 3rd level spell Fireball in most respects;
however, instead of shaping the Fireball from magical energy as the
evocation version does, this spell actually conjures a ball of fire
directly from the elemental plane of fire.  When the spell is cast, a
small interdimensional connection opens between the plane of fire and
the caster's plane; the Fireball enters through this opening and
strikes the targets as directed by the caster.  There is a chance that
an extraplanar creature may enter through the opening as well.  The
chance of this occurring is:  20% - 1% per level of the caster (to a
minimum of 1%).

This spell has the same effects (including damage) as the evocation
version, but it is slightly harder to produce these effects in this
manner; this is reflected in the higher spell level and the reduced
range and area of effect.

The material components for this spell are a piece of flint and a pinch
of sulphur.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Conjured Frost Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 20 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 50' long x 10' wide bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to Uldark's Conjured Lightning Bolt [q.v]. It
conjures a bolt of frost and ice from the para-elemental plane of ice.
The chance that an extraplanar creature enters the caster's plane is
the same as that of the Conjured Lightning Bolt spell. The bolt is 50
feet long and 10 feet wide; anyone hit by the bolt suffers 1d6 points
of damage per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). A
successful save vs. spells reduces the damage by half.

The material component for this spell is a large chunk of ice or snow;
this is consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Conjured Lightning Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 40 yards + 10 yards per 2 levels
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to Uldark's Conjured Fireball except that it
conjures a Lightning Bolt from the quasi-elemental plane of lightning,
instead of a Fireball from the plane of fire.  The chance that an
extraplanar creature enters the caster's plane is the same as that of
the Conjured Fireball spell.  The effects of this spell are identical
to that of the normal Lightning Bolt spell, but the area of effect is
either a bolt 30' long and 10' wide, or a bolt 60' long and 5' wide.

The material components of this spell are a small metal rod and the
skin of an electric eel.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vander's Librarian (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 1 minute
Area of Effect: One minor spirit
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures a minor knowledge spirit to search for books and
references for the wizard.  It can search for titles, specific
references, or general subject matter, finding books in the time it
would take a reasonably skilled librarian (depends on case).  The
wizard is freed to concentrate on more interesting matters, so this
spell roughly doubles a wizard's research efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vandergast's Forcetrap (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When this spell is cast, a shimmering, blue bolt shoots from the
caster's finger towards the target; when the target is struck, the bolt
erupts into multiple bands of force that envelop the victim. If a
successful save vs.  spell is made, the spell dissipates and has no
effect; otherwise, the bands of force will render the target completely
immobile by normal means, as his hands, feet, etc. will be snuggly
bound. The target may still levitate or employ other means of magical
movement, but may not walk, cast spells requiring a somatic component,
or fight. Any size target may be affected by this spell.

The bands of force may not be harmed by weapons or most spells, but may
be dispelled; a Wish or Limited Wish will also destroy the bands. The
only other way to escape the bands is to roll a successful bend bars
check. The victim may make one such attempt each round; in addition,
*one* attempt may be made each round from an external source; if anyone
touches the bands after the first external bend bars attempt (including
another bend bars attempt, striking the bands with a weapon, etc.) the
person touching the bands is immediately trapped as well, with no save.
If two or more persons are trapped by this spell, each earns a bend
bars roll each round; however, no external attempts may be made, or
that person will also become trapped. In any case, if a bend bars roll
is successful, the bands break, and the spells ends immediately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

View Past (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1/2" per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast on an area, it allows the caster to create a
three-dimensional image of the past in that location. The caster
specifies the time in the past through the use of the material
component.

Ten gold pieces worth of gold dust is required for each hour back into
the past the caster wishes to go. Thus, if the caster uses 240 GP worth
of dust, then he will be able to view the period from 24 hours to the
end of the duration of the spell (e.g., if the caster was 10th level,
then the duration of the spell would be from 24 hours in the past to 22
hours and 20 minutes into the past).

After the spell has been cast, the DM rolls 2D10 - 11 to determine the
error in the time frame in turns from the specified time.

The caster should roll 1D20 to determine the clarity of the casting. A
die roll of one indicates that the scene comes through as shadows in a
fog. A die roll of 20 indicates a crystal clear picture. This roll can
be repeated in subsequent castings, and represents the difficulty in
seeing through time.

Both the following dice rolls can be modified by the casters desire
based on the following modifiers:

caster participated in the event			+10
caster very well informed of the event			+6
caster knows an exact quote during the event		+4

Events that are cloaked by spells that hide themselves from

Fifth Level Spells

========================================================================

5-Mile Carrier (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Extends the range of any other spell up to 5 miles. Can shoot around
corners but not in a zig-zag shape, e.g. you could cast it with
Lightning Bolt to start the bolt on the other side of a hill 2 miles
away, but the size of the bolt is still the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Aurora Borealis (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1' per level radius ring
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a sheet of dancing, shifting light to spring up
around the caster, encompassing any area up to the maximum indicated by
the caster's level.  The Aurora will last as long as the caster
concentrates on it (concentration can be maintained while moving at
half-speed, but the caster cannot fight or cast other spells, though
speech is allowed), and for an additional 1 round per level after he or
she ceases concentration.

Any intelligent creature which views the shifting, dancing patterns of
light must save vs. spells or stand fascinated, watching the interplay
of colours and lights [cf. Hypnotic Pattern].  A maximum of 2 HD of
creatures per level of the caster can be so affected.

Any creature actually touching the Aurora will suffer 2-12 points of
damage, +1 point per level of the caster.  Fungoid monsters, undead,
and creatures native to the plane of shadow suffer 2-12 points of
damage, +2 points per level, from the effects of this spell.

The material component of this spell is a clear gemstone or crystal
prism worth not less than 100 GP, a glowworm, and a pinch of
phosphorus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Balefire (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5' x 30' x 15' cone
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws upon a nearly colourless arcane effluvium from the
Plane of Shadow.  This mystical stuff burns very hot and is extremely
viscous, but rapidly dissolves in the thick substance of the Prime
Material Plane.  Those in the area of effect may attempt a save vs.
breath weapon to avoid being covered in the stuff.  If this save is
successful, they are merely splashed with it.  Even this small amount,
however, is sufficient to cause half damage for the initial round, but
it burns out in that single round.  Those that fail to save and are
struck fully by this ghastly stuff suffer d6 fire damage per two levels
of the caster (rounded up), up to a maximum of 12d6.  The Balefire
clings to these poor victims and continues to inflict damage.  The
damage is reduced by 2d6 each round, and the it burns until all damage
potential is exhausted.  This shadow-stuff burns with a colourless fire
that can only be extinguished by magical means (e.g. Wand of Flame
Extinguishing, Fire Quench, Dispel Magic, or a magical cold spell such
as Ice Storm, Cone of Cold, Wall of Ice, or Otiluke's Freezing Sphere,
although spells involving ice may also cause impact damage to the
would-be rescuee); even total immersion in water will have no effect on
it.  This flame is so hostile to natural (i.e. Prime Material) matter
that it will burn through one inch of wood or soft metal, one quarter
inch of hard metal, or one eighth inch of stone per die of damage that
it would inflict to living targets each round it is active.  Any
individual who is struck fully (i.e. fails to save) must make item
saving throws vs. magical fire for all exposed equipment in each round
that the Balefire clings to him, though these saves are at +1
cumulative for each round after the first.  Occasional dark green or
red flickerings can be observed in an active Balefire.  The material
component is a standard opal (not a black or fire opal) worth at least
500 GP and a bit of pitch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Blue Blaze (Evocation, Conjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 50' long, 20' wide at terminus fan-shaped area
Saving Throw: Special

By utterance and extending either arm, the caster causes a fan-like
sheet of heated, purplish, acidic vapours and blue flames to leap forth
from his outstretched hand.  Any creature in the area of effect must
save twice (once vs. the fire, once vs. the acid) or suffer 1d6 per 2
levels of the caster (rounding up) from each effect.

All exposed items must save vs. acid, regardless of the result of the
save.  Item saves vs. magical fire are only necessary if the a victim
fails his save vs. that effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Incantation of Elemental Domination (Abjuration, Enchantment)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

In the casting of this spell, the wizard must choose one element to
have dominance over.  Elementals of this plane cannot approach within
5' of the caster or attack the caster in any way.  The caster can
forego this protection if desired, and attempt to charm the elemental
[cf. Charm Monster], applying a -2 penalty to the save.  If this is
attempted, than this total ward against elementals is lost.

In any event, any elemental creature (water weird, xorn, etc.) is at -1
to hit and -1 per die of damage when attacking the caster.  The caster
makes all saves vs. their attacks at +2.  The casters own attacks are
at +4 to hit (or -4 to the target's save) and +6 to damage.  He can
further affect any elemental creature with any weapon, regardless of
its level of enchantment.

The caster may converse with creatures of the chosen element, and they
will respect him if alignments are similar, or fear (if the caster
appears strong) or hate and desire to slay (if the caster appears weak)
if alignments are dissimilar.

The spell's association with one element results in a saving throw
penalty to the caster while the spell is in effect, depending on which
element is chosen:

Air	-2 vs. fire;
Earth	-2 vs. petrification;
Fire	-2 vs. water or cold;
Water	-2 vs. electricity.

The material component is a substantial amount (at least 1 cu' foot) of
the element in opposition to the element the caster desires to
dominate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Lightningarmour (Abjuration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None

The subject of this spell cannot be wearing metal armour of any sort,
nor carrying a metallic weapon larger than a shortsword.  Bracers are
permissible.  The creature touched is completely protected from
electrical damage of any sort so long as the spell is in effect.  This
protection is not absolute, having a maximum absorption of 10 points of
electrical damage per level of the caster.  Damage is absorbed by the
Lightningarmour after saving throws and any other protections have been
taken into account.  The creature under the effects of this spell carry
a negative electrical charge, and skin-to-skin contact with another
creature will cause 1d4 electrical damage with no saving throw, as will
contact through a conductor.  Anyone striking the protected creature
with a conductive object must save vs. paralysation at +1 or drop the
object due to temporary numbness in the member holding the weapon.
Those within 5' of of a character with this spell in effect may catch
a faint scent of ozone and feel their hair standing a bit on end.  The
material component of this spell is a bit of copper wire and glass
thread wrapped in clay.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Moons of Munnopoor (Alteration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 rounds
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the caster calls upon the magical influences
of the other-dimensional Moons of Munnopoor.  The caster can call upon
the power of one, two, or all three of the Moons.  This spell always
creates an area of light equal to the Moonlight spell, centered on the
caster and moving with him. However, the area of effect is only 50%
that of the normal Moonlight spell if one moon's power is invoked, 100%
normal is two moons are called upon, and 150% normal if all three moons
are utilised.  This Moonlight has all of the effects of actual
moonlight under a full moon, including effects on lycanthropes.  The
duration of this spell is also determined by the number of Moons called
upon:  if one Moon, the duration is 2 rounds per level of the caster;
if two, it's 1 round per level; and, if all three, it's 1 round per 2
levels of the caster.  Besides the light produced by the images of the
appropriate Moons appearing above the caster, each Moon provides a
specific magic-enhancing effect as follows:

Blue Moon:  All water-related (including fog-, ice-, and steam-related)
spells used by the caster gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage (though
not exceeding the normal maximum--e.g. an Ice Storm spell would inflict
3d10+3 damage, up to a maximum of 30) if the spell causes physical
damage, including the damage caused by summoned water elemental
creatures; applies a penalty of -4 to saving throws and -20% to magic
resistance to targets of spells which cause no hit point damage but do
affect an unwilling target in some way; or increases the duration of
other spells of this genre which do not fall into the above categories
(e.g. Water Breathing, Wall of Fog), doubling duration if a 1st-3rd
level spell, increasing by 50% if the spell is 4th-6th level.

Bright Moon: All spells relating to stars, moons, and other
astronomical phenomena are affected in the same way that water-related
spells are affected by the Blue Moon.

Silvery Moon:  All mind-controlling and influencing spells used by the
caster apply a -4 penalty to saves and a -20% penalty to magic
resistance checks by targets of such spells.

The material components for this spell are a white pearl or sapphire to
invoke the Blue Moon, a diamond for the Bright Moon, and a silver pearl
or moonstone for the Silvery Moon.  Whatever the combination of moons
invoked, the spell also requires a piece of black velvet along with a
crushed pearl and a crushed moonstone, and a pinch of diamond dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Saint Elmos' Fire (Evocation)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell ionises the air around the target of the spell, surrounding
him with a blue-white, glowing nimbus of electrically charged air in a
5' radius.  The target of the spell may save vs. breath weapon at -2 to
avoid the spell.  This save is at an additional -2 if the target is
carrying large, mostly metallic weapons (e.g. swords, battle axes) or
wearing partial metal armour (e.g.  studded, ring), and at -4 if
wearing full metal armour (scale or heavier).  If successful, the
target will suffer only 3d6 electrical damage as he dodges out of the
area of effect, and the spell will then dissipate that round without a
focus to coalesce about.  If the save is failed, the victim will suffer
5d6 damage every round until a save vs. breath weapon (with modifiers
as for the initial save, but with a +1 cumulative per round bonus) is
successful, at which point the spell will dissipate.  Any creature
entering the 5' radius nimbus suffers 1d6 electrical damage with no
save.  Any creature that touches or is touched by the victim of the
spell will suffer 3d6 damage with no save if the contact was
skin-to-skin, or 2d6 if it was through a conductor.  If the target is
in water, the electricity will inflict 3d6 damage with any contact, 2d6
within 5', and 1d6 within 15'.  The target of this spell may, if
desired, intentionally try to use the nimbus of electricity and the
personal electrical charge as a weapon.  The caster may end this spell
at any point, if desired.  The material components are phosphorus, a
bit of fur, amber, and a bit of cold iron.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Shooting Stars (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 5' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates glowing missiles with flaming trails, one for each
six levels of the caster (dropping all fractions).  The victim of the
spell receives no saving throw, and suffers 4d6 damage from the impact
and 8d6 from the fiery blast that accompanies the impact.  All within 5
feet of the impact point are also in the blast radius, but they may
save for half damage.  The original intended target may attempt to save
vs. petrification to avoid being struck, this save at -4 if within 20'
and at -2 if within 40'.  If this save fails, he suffers as above.  If
he succeeds, however, the shooting star(s) directed at him continue on
in a straight line to the extent of their range, at which point they
explode in a fiery burst as above.  Anyone else in the path of the
shooting star(s) must save as for the original intended target, or
become the victim of the spell.  If the caster has more than one
missile, he may direct them at one or several targets as desired.
Anyone within 5' of the path of the missile will suffer 2d6 (save for
half) fire damage simply from the heat of the passage of the shooting
star.  The material component is a bit of meteoric iron and a piece of
igneous rock.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Spectral Hound (Conjuration, Phantasm)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 6 turns per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into being a quasi-real beast appearing as a war dog
with black fur, gray ruff and tail, milky gray eyes, and insubstantial
paws which make no sound.  The creature will have average (8-10)
intelligence and can converse with the caster in the common tongue.
The creature can fight, attacking as a 2+2 HD monster and inflicting
2-8 points of damage per hit.  It can, however, affect creatures struck
only by magical weapons.  The beast itself is AC 0, and can take up to
half the caster's full hit points (rounding up) before being
dispelled.

The Hound can track any creature known to the caster, provided the
caster concentrates on a mental picture of the figure for 2 full
rounds.  The Hound can follow the trail of such a creature with 100%
certainty, -5% per hour the trail is old.  The Hound also has
infravision to 90', can spot hidden (such as in shadows) things 80% of
the time, invisible objects 65% of the time, and astral, ethereal, or
out-of-phase things 50% of the time.  The Hound normally moves at 12",
though it can run at 24" for 3 rounds each hour.  Further, the Hound
may cross muddy or swampy ground, or even water, as if were solid, dry
ground.  The Hound leaves no tracks.

By concentrating for 1 full round, the caster can make use of the
Hound's sensory abilities for as long as desired, though this does not
allow communication beyond normal vocal range.

The Hound is unaffected by any spells which alter its form (flesh to
stone, polymorph, etc.) or restrict or affect its movement (haste,
slow, hold, etc.).  If a mind control spell is cast upon the creature
and it fails its save (saving throws of the Hound are as for the
caster), then it wills itself out of existence.  It is further immune
to poison and death magics.  The hound will speak only to the caster,
and, if the caster is killed, feebleminded, charmed, or otherwise
mentally incapacitated, then the hound will immediately cease to
exist.

The material components of this spell are three canine statuettes; one
of ivory or alabaster, one of silver or platinum, and one of jet, onyx,
obsidian, or ebony.  These statuettes must be worth at least 200 GP
each, and, in the course of the spell, the three merge to become the
Spectral Hound.  When the spell ends, the Hound simply fades slowly out
of existence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Star-Powered Magery (Invocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast outdoors under a night sky where stars are
visible.  The spell requires 2 turns to cast for each level of spells
the caster is able to cast (e.g. a 12th level wizard can cast 6 levels
of spells, and so would require 12 turns).  Upon completion of the
spell, the caster's mind and body are refreshed and restored as though
the caster had rested a full day.  1-3 hit points, plus the caster's
CON bonus, if any, are restored if the caster is at less than full
health.  The power of the spell also allows the caster to memorise
spells in one-half the usual time, save for first level spells, which
may be memorised in a single round.  During the lengthy casting of this
spell, the wizard is suffused with a pale white glow, and is fully
aware of things going on nearby.  If the spell is interrupted, either
by being struck by an attack or voluntarily by the caster, then the
effect is wasted and the caster must sleep for spells as usual.  The
material component is a diamond worth at least 1,000 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starshield (Alteration, Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard's body is sheathed in a nearly
skin-tight magical screen.  This screen has the appearance of a black
night sky filled with stars.  Whenever a light-related spell of any
sort is cast at the creature using the Starshield, the spell will be
harmlessly absorbed and redirected back at the caster of the spell.
This includes such spells as Light (if cast so as to blind), Colour
Spray, Sunray, and Prismatic Spray.  An area-effect spell where the
caster is the sole target will automatically be reflected in this way.
Area-effect light spells in which others are also targeted have a
chance of being intercepted and redirected by the caster as above equal
to the caster's chance to negate the spell with a Dispel Magic spell.

The protected wizard will be unaffected by the spell in any event and,
if the spell is successfully absorbed, those behind the caster who
would have been in the area of effect are spared the effects of the
spell.  By making a successful check as if to Dispel Magic, the caster
may attempt to pass through a Prismatic Sphere or a Prismatic Wall.
Darkness spells (e.g. Darkness 15' radius, Nystul's Blackmote,
priest's Continual Darkness) will also be reflected, just as light
spells are, and the caster may attempt a saving throw vs. death magic
each round to attempt to see through any area of magical darkness
within normal vision range.  If outdoors under the night sky, the
caster can see as if in broad daylight, even through magical areas of
darkness, and also absorbs stellar radiation, regenerating 1 hit point
per round that the spell is in effect.  The material component for this
spell is a black sapphire and a star sapphire, both of which must be
worth not less than 1000 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Wizard Light (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a pearly-white globe of light equivalent to
Continual Light (q.v.).  Within the area of effect, all shadow and
darkness (even of magical origin) is dispelled, and all hidden or
invisible creatures or objects are outlined in a pale blue radiance
which lasts as long as the Wizard Light itself, even if the object or
creature so outlined moves out of the area of effect.  Further, all
glyphs of warding, symbols, and other magical writings and wards are
revealed, glowing a luminous blue, and the area of effect of such wards
is similarly outlined.  This spell does not reveal astral, ethereal, or
out-of-phase creatures, nor does it reveal purely mechanical traps and
secret doors, although traps or secret doors disguised by or utilising
magic will be revealed.  A mage using the Duo-Dimension (q.v.) spell
would appear as a thin line of blue radiance in mid-air.  This spell
does not reveal what an illusion is hiding nor the appearance of an
invisible creature (except for its outline), but merely reveals
reveals its presence and location.  Hence, a Cloak of Displacement is
useless within the Wizard Light.  The light does not "set off" magical
guards, but it does reveal the form of glyphs and such things for
possible identification and deactivation.  The material component for
this spell is a diamond worth at least 500 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Auralon's Deflective Plates (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Casting of this spell creates up to five glowing, circular plates of
force which hang in the air in a 3-foot radius around the spellcaster.
These plates move to deflect magical energies aimed at the spellcaster
of which the latter is aware. The plates are effective against magical
rays, beams, bolts and missiles from both spells and magic items. The
target of these offensive spells has only a cumulative 15% chance per
plate to be protected against totally accurate spells (such as magic
missile), but a 19% chance per plate of avoiding magic requiring a "to
hit" roll (such as lightning bolt).

Upon impact with the plates, the offensive magic is deflected at full
strength in a random direction away from the target (roll a d4 for
height: 1 or 2=same height, 3 or 4=up; and a d6 for direction relative
to the defender: 1=left, 2=left and front, 3=up in front or back at
rival caster, 4=right and front, 5=right, 6=either straight up or is
absorbed and destroys a plate). The plates can be brought down by
disintegrate or dispel magic, impact with a rod of cancellation or
shatter (destroys one plate), or a limited wish or wish. The plates do
not protect against non-magical attacks or magical attacks of a type
not listed above.

At the end of the spell's duration, the plates disappear two per round
until all are gone. The material components for this spell are tiny
disks cut from 50 GP gems, one for each plate to be invoked; the
disks are used up in the casting.

Auralon's Deflective Plates is a spell Auralon devised in his spare
time while serving under the Mageoclave, and before becoming a member
of that group.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azura's Death Shadow (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One person
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a death shadow, the magic-user brings forth a special
creature from the elemental plane of shadow.  The recipient of the
death shadow feels a chilling sensation followed by warmth as it merges
with his actual shadow. Thereafter, once a situation occurs where the
recipient takes a death stroke of any sort (failing to save vs. poison,
taking damage from an attack which causes death etc.) the shadow pushes
him to a place of safety and takes the death stroke itself,
disappearing in a black puff of smoke. The spell may last up to one day
per spell level of the caster before the shadow departs.

Note that the death shadow does not provide an instant escape route
from certain death (e.g., being immersed in acid, falling off a cliff,
etc.). It merely takes one death blow which would have normally killed
the character, and there must be an immediate place of safety within
10' for the shadow to place its host. The material components for this
spell are coal, special incense (value 200 GP), and a drop of blood,
all of which are burned at the start of casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azura's Soul Whip (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 2"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When the magic-user casts the soul ship, he creates a shimmering ebony
tendril which lashes out at one specific creature within 20'. A "to
hit" roll is necessary, but the whip strikes once per round as a
monster of the caster's hit dice, and on an unmodified roll of 20, the
whip entangles its victim for 2-5 rounds (no "to hit" needed during
that time). Whenever the weapon touches its target, it inflicts 1d8 + 3
damage points, and these points are immediately gained by the spell
caster and heals any damage previously incurred. If the caster's hit
points rise above maximum normal hit points, then the extra points will
remain for only 1 turn. The material component is a small leather
whip.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blizzard (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 5-foot per level radius area (100' maximum)
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a blizzard to hit the area of effect, resulting in
the following: movement rate is cut in half due to drifts and wind, no
missile fire or flying due to wind, and all normal flames are
extinguished. This will negate a heat metal spell, and affects magical
fires as if they had been hit with a Dispel Magic. There are no saving
throws vs. these effects.

In addition, great chunks of ice and snow fall within the area of
effect, causing 3d12 points of damage per round to anyone caught
inside. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to 1/2
the normal amount. The material components required for this spell are
five acorns and any semi-precious gem worth at least 100 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bone Splinter (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 5 levels
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

Once this spell is cast, it will affect a single target that must be
hit in melee by the caster.  The target will suffer a minor bone
fracture when affected by this spell.  If the caster misses, additional
attacks may be made in following rounds, as long as the spell duration
allows.  The spell ends when a hit is scored, or when the duration
expires, whichever comes first.

The wizard uses his normal THAC0 with a +1 "to hit" bonus, but must
make a called shot (see The Complete Fighter's Manual for details) to
one of the hit locations listed below; the appropriate "to hit"
modifier must be applied to the combat roll.  Normal attacks are not
considered accurate enough to do any real damage with this spell.

The possible hit locations, along with their combat modifier,
restrictions, and effects are as follows:

location  modifier	to hit effects
--------  --------	-----------------------------------------------
head		-8	minor skull fracture:
			2d8 points of damage (save vs. spell for 1/2
			damage).
arm *		-4	minor broken arm:
			-2 to STR & DEX when using this arm; -2 to hit,
			or shield worthless 50% of the time.
leg *		-4	minor broken leg:
			-2 to DEX when using this leg (i.e. defensive
			adjustment); movement rate is at 3/4 normal.
ribs		-4	racked rib:
			loss of 1d4 CON points and suffer 1d6 points of
			damage (no save).
spine @		-8	cracked vertebrae:
			save vs. spell or become paralysed for 2d10
			rounds.
pelvis		-4	minor hip fracture:
			-4 to DEX when using legs; movement rate is at
			1/2 normal.

* if attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be
targeted.
@ the spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

Multiple hits inflict cumulative damage.  A cure serious wounds will
heal one of these effects, but will not heal any associated hit point
loss (another cure spell is required to do so).  A cure critical wounds
will heal two effects, And a heal will fully restore the victim (unless
dead).

The material components for this spell are a bit of bone and a small
metal hammer, both of which are consumed when the spell is cast.

[author's note:  the requirement for called shots is simply for
convenience; if the DM wishes to compile a hit location chart, then
normal attacks may be used in addition to called shots.]

Chaos Magic (Alteration)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1-foot per level radius area
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a sphere that has all the properties of a Forgotten
Realms (tm) wild magic area (see the FR Sourcebook for details).  The
area of chaos magic is permanent until destroyed (it may only be
destroyed as per a wild magic area).  The sphere of chaos magic is
non-mobile.

The material component for this spell is a pint of blood from any
chaotic magic-using creature.  The blood is consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cone of Acid (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is much like Cone of Cold or Cone of Fire (q.v.), except
that it causes acid damage. Damage is 1d4 + 1, per level of the mage.
The material component is one citrus fruit per level of the mage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cone of Fire (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of fire
originating at the mage's hand and extending outwards in a cone 1/2
inch long per level of the caster. It causes inflammable objects to
catch on fire, and great heat in nonflammable objects. Damage is 1d4 +
1, per level of the mage. For example, a tenth level mage would cast a
Cone of Fire causing 10d4 + 10 points of damage. Its material component
is a red garnet(s) worth at least 100 GP [cf. Cone of Cold].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deflect Normal Weapon Attacks (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast, this spell creates an invisible, mobile forcefield around the
recipient. This barrier has an armour class of 4 and a number of hit
points equal to 5 times the caster's level. All non-magical melee and
missile attacks made on the recipient, are directed against the shell
instead. Damage from such attacks will not harm the recipient until the
wall is destroyed. This spell has no effect on any magical attacks,
which inflict full damage on the barrier and the recipient.

If an attack hits the barrier, the protected creature must make a
saving throw vs. spell. If this save fails, damage is rolled normally
against the forcefield (if the damage inflicted equals or exceeds the
remaining hit point total of the wall, it is destroyed, but any excess
damage does not affect the recipient at this time). If the save is
successful, the attack is deflected away harmlessly.

If an attack fails to score a hit on the barrier (i.e. misses AC 4),
the attack is reflected back at the attacker; the attacker must then
make normal attack and damage rolls against himself. The material
component for this spell is a powdered black opal which is consumed
with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Detect Spell (Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 3" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Spell casting leaves a magical residue in the surrounding area which
this spell is designed to detect. When the spell is cast, the caster
can examine any spell that was cast in this area up to limit of 1 week
in the past per level of the caster.

One spell can be examined per round, with the spells being detected in
reverse chronological order. The information obtained about the spell
is as follows:

When cast			School of magic
Location and area of effect	Relative level of spell
Casting time and duration	Relative level of caster
Means of casting

Possible means of casting include from memory, from a scroll, and from
a natural power.

If the caster needs to examine spells farther back in the past, then
the spell can be repeated within one day, and the caster can pick up
where he left off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Greater Eldritch Sphere (Evocation)

Range: 2" + 1" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1' diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a similar but superior version of the eldritch sphere,
inflicting 2d6 base damage + 3 points per level of the magic-user, up
to 2d6 + 30 maximum (e.g. a 10 hit die greater eldritch sphere does
32-42 damage points).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Spellblade (Evocation)

Range: 5"
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The Spellblade is a 1' - 5' variable diameter rotating circular blade
of force which the magic-user mentally commands, and he must
concentrate to maintain it (thus any successful attack against the
magic-user ends the Spellblade).

There are actually two variants for the spell, and the type must be
selected at the start of casting.  The first strikes with a +1 to +5
"to hit" bonus (corresponding to the blade's diameter) and attacks
everything within the designated area of effect. It inflicts 1d10 base
damage + 1 damage point per caster's level. The second version directly
attacks walls of force, having a 1% cumulative chance per damage point
inflicted of bringing down a barrier. It has no effect upon other
creatures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Cone (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a cone of fire that streaks from the caster's hand
towards the target(s); this cone is 2' wide at the point of origin, 25'
wide at the base, and is 10' long for every level of the caster, up to
a maximum of 200'. Anyone caught inside the cone suffers 4d8 points of
damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 4d8 +
20); a successful save vs.  spell reduces the damage by half.
Combustible objects must save vs. magical fire or be consumed.

The material component for this spell is a handful of red dragon scales
that must be tossed in the air when the spell is cast; the scales are
consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greenfire (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 10" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1/10 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

On casting the Greenfire spell, a bolt of green luminescence appears
from the mages fingers, and impacts on the target (a made saving throw
means the bolt missed the target, but it hit somewhere...). From this
impact point, a green sphere begins to grow, at a rate depending on the
material consumed. Items in this area of effect must save vs.
disintegration every 1/10 round. Items that save halt the progress of
the sphere until they fail their save. Note: the spell expands for a
set time, not to a set radius, so an artifact that continues to save
will halt the growth of the sphere for the full duration of the spell.

Rate of growth:

2" per 1/10 round (yes, 20 feet) in air alone: (not an aerial weapon),
but as soon as it hits something solid, it will take a 1/10 round to
consume it.

1' per 1/10 round in air/solid mix (cliff face, floor, person).

1/2' per 1/10 round in just rock (ordinary rock gets no save).

1/12' per 1/10 round in water (but draws everything to it like a Sphere
of Annihilation).

Note I: the sphere begins at a 1' radius, and does not appear until the
bolt either strikes something solid or reaches maximum range.

Note II: the point of origin of the sphere remains constant, even if in
midair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Energy Lightning Bolt (Evocation)

Range: 4" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Like Lightning Bolt but does 1d8 damage per level, maximum 20d8.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Fire Ball (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

As its name implies, this is an improved version of the third level
Fireball spell. It has one of two applications as chosen at the time of
casting: the first option mimics the Fireball spell in all respects
except that damage is 1d8 per level of the caster (up to a maximum of
10d8) and saving throws are at -1.

The second version of the spell has a 10-foot radius instead of the
normal 20-foot. Due to this reduced area of effect, damage is increased
to 1d10 per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d10) and saving
throws are at -2. It is like a Fireball spell in all other respects.

The material components for this spell are a pinch of sulphur and a
fire opal of not less than 200 GP in value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Armour Reversal (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell reverses the effects of armour worn (or lack thereof) on the
subject touched, in the sense that melee attacks that would have
normally hit the subject will miss, and melee attacks that would have
normally missed the subject will hit.  For example, an AC 5 mage that
has cast Armour Reversal on himself is attacked by a 10th-level
fighter.  The fighter would normally need a 6 or better to hit AC 5;
with this spell in effect, the fighter needs a 5 or *less* to hit AC
5.  Note that this spell is more useful as the amount of armour the
subject has on decreases!

All bonuses "to hit" that the opponent has work in the opponent's
favour, i.e. if the aforementioned fighter had a Strength of 17 (+1 "to
hit") and a +2 weapon, these would be *subtracted* from the die roll -
thus the fighter would need an 8 or less to hit AC 5.  Likewise,
penalties are added to the die roll, penalising the attacker as usual.

This spell does not affect missile weapons at all, nor does it affect
spell saving throws or anything other than melee weapon attacks.  If
the subject of the spell is willing to have the spell cast upon him,
there is no saving throw; otherwise the subject saves as usual.  The
spell can be counteracted by the usual means (Dispel Magic, et al.), by
another casting of Armour Reversal, or by the 7th-level spell Jamye's
Improved Armour Reversal (q.v.).

The material components of this spell are a small magnet and a diamond
of not less than 100 GP value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Greased Lightning (Evocation)

Range: 40 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell differs from the third-level Lightning Bolt spell in the
following ways:

- the components and casting time are greatly reduced;
- damage done is d4+2 per caster level instead of d6;
- maximum damage is 15d4+30;
- the bolt is a vivid orange, with green "stripes" running through it.

It conforms to Lightning Bolt in all other respects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kalessin's Long Arm (Conjuration)

Range: 20 feet
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to cast various spells requiring physical
contact at range. The caster must have a clear view of the creature to
be "touched", and there can be no obstructions between target and
caster.

To use this spell, the caster first casts Long Arm, then whatever spell
he wants to do at range, in the following round. If the caster is
disturbed following the casting of Long Arm, the spell is ruined.
Disturbance could be anything from heavy jostling, to actually taking
damage. If the target moves out of sight before the caster can get off
the second spell, the the spell is ruined.  The target gets regular
saving throws for the second spell.

The material component of this spell is a jade tipped wand, which
disappears after casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Meillikhom's Room of Seclusion (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 week per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' area
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster can create an extra-dimensional room (5'
cube per level) with one side adjacent to an unbroken 10' x 10' area
(i.e. one that has no doors, windows, or other such openings).  The
surface area (which must be touched) now acts as a phase door into the
secluded room. The room can be of any shape and size up to the limit of
the spell but at least one side must be at least a 10' x 10' area.
Thus, the room could be rectangular, pyramidal, hemispherical, etc. The
room lasts for 1 week per level of the caster, or until dispelled.

The caster may bring any item, materials, etc. as he desires into the
room, so long as the object can fit through the phase door and is
touched by the caster (and only by the caster).

At the end of the spell's duration, anyone or anything still within the
room is now trapped in that extradimensional space. escape is only
possible through other extraplanar travel. This also occurs when a
dispel magic or similar magic is cast against the phase door area.

The phase door itself is detectable by any means available that can
detect magical auras, but the room itself can only be contacted through
extraplanar means. Spells such as clairvoyance and clairaudience would
not detect the extraplanar room but would instead detect whatever was
on the other side of the phase door surface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mental Ledger (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: See below
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to record spells in an unused portion of
his brain, just as if it was recorded in a spell book. The caster can
record three spell levels for each level of experience.

This will enable the caster to memorise spells as if the caster were
reading the spells from a spellbook.

If the caster wishes to change the spells memorised therein, then the
caster must recast mental ledger to change the contents.

The casting time of the spell is one hour per spell level to be
memorised.

The material components of this spell is a slate of pure quality lead
crystal of no less than 5000 GP value which disappears after the spell
is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Missile Multiplication II (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1/5 round
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One missile
Saving Throw: None

A missile must be fired within the next twelve seconds. This spell
makes 3-18 missiles out of one. Unlike the fourth level version, the
fifth level version of this spell will multiply "abnormal" missiles,
like poison darts, Ballista bolts, catapult rocks and other such
things. All other effects are similar to the spell of fourth level. The
possibility of using lethal poison is at the DM's option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pobithakor's Protection (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1/2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This is an improved version of Pobithakor's pacifier. When the caster
is effected by Pobithakor's placer spell, this spell can be cast so
that the caster is not pulled to the caster's location. This spell
simply stops the effect from occurring at all.

This spell can also be cast to return a scrying portal to one way only
after it has been effected Pobithakor's tracer spell without having to
resort to dispel magic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rathe's Contingency Trigger (Alteration)

Range: 3 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One cube foot per level maximum
Saving Throw: Special

The Contigency Trigger functions identically to the third level Rathe's
Trigger spell, with one exception: a condition may be applied to the
triggering of the spell (for instance, "trigger only if a man wearing
green enters the area", or "trigger if anything made of gold enters the
area"). Note however that the spell's "perception" is restricted to the
area of effect. The spell cannot perceive intangibles such as class,
level, or alignment. The material component is as the Rathe's Trigger
spell, but must be worth twice as much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rhuva's Wizard Stomper (Divination, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 hours + 10 minutes per level
Casting Time: 5 minutes
Area of Effect: 10 yards per level
Saving Throw: Special

Designed to prevent the casting of spells in the area of effect, the
wizard stomper produces a nearly uncontrollable surge of energy into a
wizard who attempts to draw power for a spell.  The victim must save
vs. spells at -6.  Failure means the spell is aborted and the caster
takes 1d6 damage per level of the spell attempted.  If the save is
made, the spell can be cast at +1 on all damage dice, but at double
normal casting time.

If a wizard has been stomped before, and knows what to expect, the save
is only at -3.

Material component is a handful of ruby dust worth at least 25 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Ethereal Transfer (Alteration, Enchantment)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

By means of this spell, a mage is able to cause one creature of his
current size class to enter the ethereal plane. Once there, the
creature is empowered to exit through any border ethereal curtains onto
one of the elemental planes or the prime material plane unless it was
an unwilling victim of this spell and failed to make its saving throw,
although a successful Dispel Magic cast on the creature (in a border
ethereal curtain) will cause it to exit through the border ethereal.
Otherwise, the creature is stuck in the ethereal plane until it can
find another way to transfer from the border ethereal into an elemental
or prime material plane.

For every 2 levels of experience over 9th level a mage may touch an
additional person of his size class and transfer him into the ethereal
plane. The classes are tiny, small, medium, large, huge, and
gargantuan. If the caster is of medium size he has each touch slot
equal to 3 tiny, 2 small, 1 medium, 1/2 large, 1/4 huge, and 1/6
gargantuan size classes. Therefore, he would need 6 slots (i.e., be a
19th level mage) to cast a gargantuan creature into the ethereal
plane.

Note that a creature's wisdom bonus or penalty against mind effecting
spells modifies its saving throw when it is an unwilling recipient
against this spell unless it is currently voluntarily allowing another
spell to be cast upon it, in which case it is allowed no saving throw.
The material component of this spell is normally a small piece of
cockatrice flesh, but almost any animal with sensory powers which
extend into the ethereal plane will work.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Golden Stars of Protection (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One floating 2' high star plate per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates golden, shimmering, star-shaped plates of force
which move around the caster in a constant motion, deflecting any
missile, hand, or weapon attacks directed at the caster. The Armour
Class of the mage is improved by a factor of 1 for every three stars
still active and any successful physical melee attack (including
boulders, ballista, or attack forms similar to a dragon's belly flop
maneuver) will be deflected automatically. Creatures of size L (or
larger) who are deflected must still land somewhere, possibly injuring
friend or foe. Non-missile attacks by creatures with an effective
strength of 25 require a saving throw versus breath weapons to
deflect.

Each star is able to sustain 10 hit points of damage before disrupting,
so if a deflected attack does not cause enough damage to disrupt a star
(chosen randomly) the star will remain active. For every 5 stars
active, the effects of breath weapons directed at the caster will be
reduced by 1 hit point per damage die, with total protection from
breath attacks becoming a possibility, though, unless the breath weapon
causes less damage than the current hit points of a star it will
assuredly disrupt the entire field of stars in the process.

While the stars orbit the mage he is at a -1 to hit penalty for every
star active whenever a to hit roll is needed, including spells. The
mage may create fewer stars than the maximum possible. Also, the mage
may choose to release up to three stars per round at up to three
different opponents no farther away from the caster than 1/2" per level
and who are in his line of sight. Released stars act and attack as
Magic Missiles and should be considered triple strength versions of a
normal Magic Missile for defensive considerations. A star (chosen
randomly from the remaining stars) will do damage equal to its current
hit points. The material component(s) of this spell is a single gold
piece for every five-pointed star created. All pieces are thrown into
the air where they disappear and are replaced by the floating stars.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scrybane (Divination, Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: One person in a 300-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

For this spell to work, the wizard must cast it when he believes that
he is being watched through the use of spells or magical scrying
devices (for instance, ESP, crystal balls, or wizard eyes).
Immediately after the wizard being scryed casts this one-word spell,
the scryer may suffer one or more of the following effects (roll
separate percentile dice for each):

80% chance of being affected as if by the spell forget,
55% chance of taking 2-8 hit points of damage from the backlash,
10% chance of falling into a coma lasting 1-20 days, and
5% chance of being feebleminded, as the spell.

All spell-like effects are at the level of the caster of the Scrybane.
The scryer must make separate saving throws to avoid each of the
effects befalling him. The material components for this spell are a
dark translucent stone worth at least 500 gold pieces, and a small
flame.

The spell Scrybane is one of many powerful "anti-divinatory" spells. A
wise mage should somehow acquire one before beginning magical research
of his own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Dragon Claw (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures a semi-real, shadowy dragon claw anywhere within
spell range. This claw will attack any target as directed by the
caster; full concentration is necessary to attack with the claw; if the
caster loses concentration, the claw will hover in place until the
caster again gains control. The claw's attack uses the caster's normal
THAC0 and inflicts damage equal to that of the dragon the material
component came from. For example, if the material component came from a
black dragon, the attack inflicts 1-6 points of damage per attack.

For every 5 levels of the caster, one attack with the claw may be made,
up to a maximum of 4 attacks, although only a single attack may be made
in a single round. The claw dissipates when the maximum number of
attacks is made, or when the spell duration expires, whichever comes
first. The claw may also be dispelled, but may not be harmed by other
attacks.

The material component for this spell is the claw from any type of
dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Flamestaff (Enchantment/Charm, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell will enchant one normal staff with a temporary magical
dweomer. In order to cast this spell, a ruby worth at least 300 GP is
bound to the end of the staff; this gem will glow with a soft light as
long as the spell is in effect. This spell may have one of two affects
as decided at the time of the casting: the staff may be used to
discharge a Fireball as per the spell; this will have all the effects
(including dice of damage) as if the caster had cast a Fireball spell;
discharging the Fireball has a casting time of 1. If used in this
manner, the spell expires after the Fireball is used, or after 1 round
per level of the caster has passed (if not used in that time, the spell
dissipates, and has no effect).

Alternately, the caster may employ a number of lesser effects: if the
staff scores a hit in combat, the staff will discharge a burst of
flames that will engulf the target; these flames inflict 1d4 points of
damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to a maximum of
1d4+20). A successful save vs.  spell reduces the damage by one half;
if the save fails, all possessions must save vs. magical fire, or be
consumed. The staff may be used in this manner once per five levels of
the caster (to a maximum of 4 times). If the staff misses its targets,
no charge is used (nor may the caster elect to do so); a charge is used
only if a hit is scored. If all charges are not used in 1 round per
level of the caster, the spell dissipates, and all remaining charges
are lost.

The only material components for this spell are the staff and the ruby;
the ruby is consumed when the spell ends, but the staff is not
affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Shockingstaff (Enchantment/Charm, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is identical to Sillvatar's Flamestaff except it may be used
to discharge a lightning bolt (as per the spell) or electrical
discharges when a hit is scored in combat. Damage, duration, etc. are
identical to that of the Flamestaff. Saves for possessions are made vs.
lightning for both applications of this spell.

Instead of a ruby, this spell has a sapphire for a material component;
it is consumed when the spell ends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sonoric's Illusionary Observer (Divination, Illusionism/Phantasm)

Range: 100 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: One turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the illusion of a creature, up to Medium in size,
through which the caster gains the advantage of a clairaudience and
clairvoyance spell. The caster must determine the appearance of the
illusionary observer, during the casting of the spell. If it is a
creature the caster is not familiar with, observers of the illusion are
at +4 to notice it as such. If the caster has an accurate drawing or
carving of the illusionary subject, observers are at -4 to spot the
illusion. Those successfully noticing the illusion see it become merely
become translucent, it does not disappear. The illusion is incapable of
making any sounds, and is completely insubstantial, even if someone
touching it is unaware that it is an illusion.

The illusion has a movement rate of 30", and it is capable of passing
through solid objects, all save lead, the touch of which cancels the
spell. The caster must carefully concentrate on the illusion (i.e.
incapable of other action) to use the clairaudience and clairvoyance
powers, as well as keeping the appearance realistic. If the caster
breaks concentration for some reason, the illusion freezes in whatever
position it was in, until the caster resumes concentration or the
spell's expires.

The material components for this spell are a bit of fleece, and a
humanoid eye and ear.

Sonoric's Superior Minions (Conjuration/Summoning, Divination)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour + 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons a major etherling, from the Ethereal Plane, to do
the caster's bidding. Major Etherlings are fairly intelligent, although
they still suffer from summoner-awe. The caster summons one etherling
per five levels, for example two at sixth, three at eleventh, etc. The
summoned etherlings are eager to serve the caster, and they are capable
of more complicated tasks than their lesser brethren.

A major etherling (AC: 0, MV: 60, HD: 4, #AT: 2, D: 1-3/1-3, INT: 12)
is a mansized, transparent, humanoid-appearing creature, formed of the
stuff of the plane ethereal. It has some control over its appearance on
the Prime Material plane, although, regardless of form, they have
blurry outlines, and are partially transparent. It also moves by
flight, although it is sophisticated enough to give the illusion of
walking.  Being mostly on the ethereal plane, it is able to pass
through solid objects, save lead, the touch of which, if it fails a
save versus paralysation, returns it to the Ethereal plane, cancelling
the spell.  Major etherlings are fairly intelligent, and have a 20%
chance of knowing any specific minor lore, although it will answer such
a question only once. A major etherling will be stricken with extreme
respect for the summoner, and will attempt to follow the spirit of its
commands to the best of its ability. It has the ability to turn small
items, of less than ten pounds in weight, ethereal, allowing it to
transport the item. It may only carry one such item at a time,
however.  It too has a photographic memory.

Major etherlings are capable of performing complicated tasks, and can
grasp abstract concepts. Once given a task, it will remain on the Prime
Material plane until the task is complete, or its time runs out. One
advantage the major etherling possess over its lesser brethren.
however, its ability to move into the Ethereal Plane, and return to the
Prime Material plane, essentially teleporting. It is also capable of
completing tasks on the Ethereal plane, as well as the Prime Material.
Again, an intelligence check is required for particularly baffling
problems encountered in its task, and if the task is rendered somehow
incompletable, and the etherling makes it INT check, it will return to
the caster, and inform him of the problem, before returning to the
ethereal plane (for good).

Being dual-plane beings, they are only hit by magic weapons, and
spells.  The material components of this spell are jade figurines, one
for each etherling to be summoned.

Summon Warrior (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 40 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the wizard conjurers 1d3
warriors to aid him. The summoned warriors will be of a level equal to
1/2 the level of the caster (rounded down) up to a maximum of twentieth
level. They will perform as per monsters summoned by monster summoning
spells. Note that in certain, circumstances, adventurers may be
summoned (who will recall the details of their trip). The warriors will
appear anywhere within the spell range as desired by the caster.

The type of warrior summoned is as follows:

caster's level	fighter	ranger	paladin
--------------	-------	------	-------
15 and under	70%	20%	10%
16-20		60%	20%	20%
21 and over	50%	25%	25%

Equipment and abilities are determined randomly. The material
component for this spell is a dagger of the finest quality, which is
consumed when the spell is cast.

Superior Sleep (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 6" diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This is a much improved version of the first level Magic User spell
sleep. The creatures affected fall into a deep slumber from which they
cannot awaken from for at least one turn (unless a dispel magic is
used).

For each creature the caster chooses to affect, a certain
amount of the spells power is used to put the creature to
sleep. An effect die roll of 4-48 is rolled. This is the
number of points that can be used to put creatures to sleep.
It takes a different number of points per creature to put a
creature to sleep, depending upon its hit dice or level. The
caster can keep on putting creatures to sleep until all the
points are used up, or there is not enough points left to
effect another creature, or that all the creatures are
already asleep in the area of effect. The point costs are as
follows:

Hit dice of
creature to	Max.	Avg.
be affected	Cost	Affected	Affected
------------	----	--------	--------
up to .5	.5	96		60
.5 + 1 to 01	01	48		30
01 + 1 to 03	02	24		15
03 + 1 to 05	03	16		10
05 + 1 TO 07	04	12		07
07 + 1 TO 09	06	08		05
09 + 1 TO 10	12	04		02
10 + 1 TO 11	24	02		01
11 + 1 TO 12	30	01		01

Note: As an additional twist, the particular enchantments of this spell
do not allow elves their normal resistance to enchantment/charm, but in
turn they get a save vs. spells to avoid the effects of the spell.

The material components of this spell is sand from a dead sandman which
is tossed in the air while the caster sings a short lullaby.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taint Alignment (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level or special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One humanoid creature
Saving Throw: Special

Taint alignment has similar effect to a character as performing a deed
opposite to his alignment, except that this one shows. Casting it
requires knowing the Truename of the target, which knowledge can be
obtained by other magic. Casting the spell causes the target to make a
saving throw vs. spells with a penalty of 2 on die roll. If he makes
the save, the spell rebounds on the caster, who shall also have to
save, but with a bonus of 2 on die. The spell shall rebound between the
two regardless of distance until one fails a save, or both have made
three saves, in which case the spell fails. An affected TN character
would get a random alignment of the corner 4.

Effects vary depending on the alignment of the victim. If the affected
is a paladin, the effects thus far taken for granted are reversed:
laying on hands would cause damage, detect evil turns into detect good,
remove fear effect into cause fear. Yet, the paladin might have no idea
what's happening until he tries to ride his mount or draw his Holy
Avenger +5. For an anti-paladin, the same goes, reversed. A cleric
would instantly lose the ability to acquire spells, though not his
spell casting or scroll reading ability.

For any character, there's a number of standard effects:

- Know Alignment shows the reversed alignment.
- Detect Good/Evil work as for the new alignment.
- Bad dreams.
- Problems with other people. The Good emit fear, the Evil get liked,
  Law be approached with caution, Chaos be felt as a sign of
  responsibility.
- Temples of one's own religion feel bad.
- Temptation to truly switch alignment fully, which would have the
  certain standard effects described in DMG, such as losing a level of
  experience. a change in alignment can be felt by people in contact
  with the affected. Not definitely, but more in the "I feel
  something's wrong"-manner.

The curse cannot be magically removed with anything less than a Limited
Wish, until the time is full. Of course, the target wouldn't know that
the effect isn't permanent..

If a sign of faltering from the original alignment is done, then the
effect does become permanent. Slight faltering causes prolonged
duration, as the energy of the spell isn't as seriously tried as it
might be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tonguetwister (Abjuration, Alteration)

Range: 10 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: Negates

When this spell is cast on an enemy spellcaster, it will cause the
target's tongue to twitch violently, thus disrupting any spell being
cast at the moment, unless the victim makes a successful save vs.
spell.  The level of the spell being cast by the target determines the
modifier applied to the save as follows:  save modifier = spell level -
5 (i.e. a 2nd level spell inflicts a -3 to the save, a 7th level spell
earns a +2 to the save, etc.).

The victim must be in the process of casting a spell with a *verbal*
component.  If no spell is currently being cast by the target, the
Tonguetwister has no effect.  If the opponent's spell goes into effect
at the same time as the Tonguetwister, the victim earns an additional
+2 bonus to the save.  This spell cannot affect a spell that has
already been cast, nor one that is to be cast in the future.

The material component of this spell is a tongue of any creature; this
is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

who have less than 5 hit points maximum and less than 8 intelligence to
die.

The spell can effect a total number of hit points equal to seven times
the casters level.

When determining what creatures die from the effects of the spell,
start with the creatures with the lowest hit points, and then go from
there.

The material components for the spell is a handful of live bugs which
must be squashed as the spell is cast while the caster yells out "Seven
in one blow!".

door up to 3" away. The first door appears framed by glowing blue lines
5' wide by 8' tall. The second door is invisible. Living matter up to
400 pounds or non-living up to 800 pounds may be transported from the

Wiley's Teleport (Alteration)

Range: 150 miles
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration

Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to teleport himself and -7000 GP + 1000 GP
per level of additional stuff that he is carrying to a specified
destination at most 150 miles distant. The chances of error are the
same as for normal teleport, except that if the caster would normally
end up is a solid object, the spell will abort. The maternal component

Wolldin's Backstabber (Illusion/Phantasm) Level 5

Range: 20' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell requires the presence of any piercing melee weapon in order
to work; the caster holds the weapon, and when the incantations are
complete, the weapon vanishes and reappears in the hands of an
invisible spectral creature.  A True Seeing or Detect Invisible spell,
or similar magic will reveal the vague outline of a figure; others will
only see the weapon hovering in the air.

The figure (and weapon) will appear behind the creature chosen as the
target for this spell (the target must be within spell range); it will
then deliver an instantaneous backstab at the victim. The caster's
normal THAC0 is used to resolved hits (all applicable bonuses apply
normally, including the bonus for attacking from behind); the attack is
always made with surprise (unless it is normally impossible to surprise
the target) and therefore, dexterity and shield bonuses to AC do not
apply to the attack.

In the case of a successful hit, the base damage is as per the weapon
used in the attack; however the attack also receives a backstab damage
bonus as if made by a thief of a level equal to the caster's level;
normal damage bonuses also apply to the attack.

The only material component for this spell is the weapon used in the
attack; it, as well as the spectral creature, disappear after the
attack is made, whether it was successful or not.

Acid Rain (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 3 levels
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10 square feet + 5 square feet per 2 levels
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell will cause a sheet of corrosive acid to fall from the sky
(actually, it will appear 10 feet over the target spot). All creatures
or objects underneath will be subject to its effects. The acid will
corrode wood, metal, cloth, and flesh. The initial inundation will
cause 1d6 damage per level (with a maximum of 10d6). A successful
saving throw will cause half damage, and adds +1 to subsequent saves.
All items exposed to the acid must also save. If a magical item saves
successfully, no further saves are necessary.

Armour loses one point of AC per round. If it loses all of its points,
it disintegrates and falls to the ground. Weapons lose one point per
round. The number of points is determined by size (L=3, M=2, S=1). When
all points are gone, the weapon is too weak to use in combat.

All damage done to items (other than loss of magical properties), can
be repaired with a Mend spell, or the like, unless the item was
destroyed. Subsequent damage to flesh is 1d6 per round. All subsequent
damage can be avoided if victims immerse themselves in water, to wash
off the acid.

The material components of this spell are rain water and sulpher.

Alpha's Firefountain (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to the 4th level Alpha's Firefall spell, but is
more powerful in two ways.  First, the spray of liquid fire burns for a
total of three rounds, inflicting 3d6 damage the first round, 2d6 the
second, and 1d6 the third.  There is no saving throw vs. the damage
inflicted by the spray.  Second, the caster is able to throw up one
prominence of flame (for 4d10 fire damage the first round, and 2d10 the
second, with a save vs. breath weapon to halve damage) for every six
levels of the caster (rounding off all fractions).  The material
component is a lump of pitch, sulfur, saltpeter, and magnesium and an
available fire source.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Rainbow Warrior (Evocation, Summoning)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell invokes energy and the spirit of a creature from the Quasi-
Elemental Plane of Radiance.  The Rainbow Warrior has as many hit
points as the caster would at full health, and attacks as a fighter of
half the caster's level.  The Warrior has an armour class of 0, and can
only be struck by magical weapons.  It attacks with a spear of
radiance, which causes damage the same way as the 2nd level Rainbow
Beam spell if the target is struck.  As with that spell, the caster has
a 5% per level chance of selecting the colour of the spear, otherwise it
is random.  The Rainbow Warrior may fly at a movement rate of 24, but
it has no real substance and cannot touch nor carry any material
object.  Creatures dwelling on or drawing power from the Negative
Material Plane or Plane of Shadow suffer 1d6 damage every round that
they are within 20' of the Rainbow Warrior, as it sheds a bright globe
of light strongly infused with energy from the Positive Material
Plane.  The Rainbow Warrior is unaffected by poison, paralysis,
petrification, fire, electricity, gas, or acid.  Unholy water causes it
2d4 damage, and cold attacks do full normal damage.  Negative energy
attacks gain a bonus of +1 per die of damage, and any spells involving
darkness cause the Rainbow Warrior 2d6 damage per level of the spell,
though the darkness spell will then be dispelled.  Any darkness spell
coming into contact with the 20' globe of light surrounding the Rainbow
Warrior must be checked as if Dispel Magic was being cast at the level
of the summoner of the Warrior.  Only one such dispelling attempt is
possible for each darkness spell that could be affected, although the
Warrior can automatically dispel any darkness spell by touching the
area of effect, but it will suffer damage as if the spell had been cast
specifically at him.  Dark-dwelling creatures (e.g. drow, duergar) are
affected by the Rainbow Warrior's globe of light as they would be by
Continual Light.  The material component of this spell is a clear
diamond worth not less than 5000 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alpha's Starlight Citadel (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 30 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell can only be cast in an area under star- or moonlight.  When
cast, it brings into being a deep blue-black tower of magical metal,
with many faint silvery gleams.  This tower is in all respects similar
to a Daern's Instant Fortress (q.v.) except that it grows slowly during
the course of the casting, and so no creature able to move could
possibly be harmed by its expansion.  The door to the Citadel is Wizard
Locked at the caster's level.  One creature for each level of
experience of the caster may be designated in the casting of the spell,
and such creatures may freely open the door, though the caster may
override this at any time by mental command.  The magic of the walls of
the citadel prevents the passage of any creature ethereal, astral, or
out-of-phase creature.  Teleportation into and out of the tower is
still possible.  This spell lasts until the first rays of direct
sunlight strike the tower, but it cannot last longer than 2 hours + 1
hour per level of the caster in any event.  The material component is a
star sapphire and a small steel carving of a tower.

Alter Occurrence (Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: Infinite
Components: V
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is a weaker version of the 7th level wizard spell Limited
Wish. Alter Occurrence enables the wizard to alter the way an event in
the very recent past actually occurred. For the casting of the spell,
the wizard recounts an event which occurred up to two rounds previous
which he viewed firsthand. The wizard, while recounting the incident,
modifies it in the way which he would have liked for it to occur. At
the end of the casting, the past will be rewoven along the lines of the
caster's version, by a base guideline of 3% per level of the caster.
(For instance, Johann, a 12th level wizard, uses the spell to make a
freak gust of wind blow an arrow totally off course which shot his
companion Rykor in the heart a few seconds ago -- a critical hit.
Johann has a 36% chance to make the arrow miss, else it still hits
doing regular damage. If Johann had asked for the arrow to have missed
Rykor's heart, it might have still hit Rykor but would have done only
100 - 36 = 64% of the designated damage.)

This spell will automatically modify the perceptions of the past for
all of those, other than the caster, who were present during both the
modified and unmodified events unless they make a saving throw vs.
spells. Alter Occurrence cannot be used to raise character abilities
(even temporarily) or mimic other magical effects. Frequent use of
this spell may cause the wizard to go insane; make an INT check with a
cumulative -1 penalty each time the spell is used by the same caster
over a one week period, or suffer a random type of insanity.

Alter Occurrence is a spell published by the wizard Saridan Hysakai
after over a decade of study (an unknown amount of which was spent at
the Plane of Time). Saridan subsequently went insane.

Azura's Black Scythe (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Casting time: 6
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Area of Effect: 1" long, 180 degree arc
Saving Throw: Special

The black scythe is a fearsome weapon to behold, stretching 8' and
immolated in wispy green flames. It sweeps a 10' long, 180 degree arc
and can hit all targets within its area as a monster of the caster's
hit die. Creatures up to 4+1 hit dice are slain instantly, while those
above 4+1 hit dice but below 8+3 must save vs. spells or be stunned for
2-5 round. Those who possess 8+3 hit dice up to 10 hit dice must save
vs. spells or be slowed for 1-4 rounds. All effects are cumulative.
The scythe inflicts 1d10 damage in addition to its other effects.  The
material component is a miniature sickle with an ebony shaft and an
adamantine blade costing 500 GP to construct.

Block Teleport (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S

Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 day
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Coradon's Cataclysmic Corinary (Invocation/Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

After this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful attack in
melee to affect the target.  The wizard's normal THAC0 is used with a
+2 modifier to hit.  The spell will last until a hit is scored, or
until the duration expires, whichever comes first.  If a hit is made,
the victim suffers a massive heart attack and must make a successful
system shock roll or die.  Even if this roll succeeds, the target
suffers damage equal to 1d4 + 1 per level of the caster.

Create Ghast (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates up to one ghast per six levels of the caster, and
these ghasts will follow the commands of their creator to the best of
their ability. Each ghast is formed from the corpse of a human slain by
a ghoul or ghast who has not yet risen as a ghoul itself. These corpses
are the material components of the spell. As implied above, humans
killed by a ghast will rise as ghouls to follow the pack.

Diamondblade (Enchantment/Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 turns + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One edged melee weapon
Saving Throw: None

This spell turns an ordinary edged melee weapon into a blade of
sharpness, as per Sword of Sharpness (see AD&D 2nd edition, page 186).
For the duration of the spell, the weapon is treated as a weapon +3 or
better for purposes of who or what can be hit by it, even though it
gets only a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. However, on a very
high roll, it will sever an extremity, determined by a dice roll. The
spell functions on existing magical weapons, as long as the total
combined bonus is +3 or less.

The material component for this spell is a 1000 GP diamond, however,
the tooth of a Tarrasque may be substituted in which case the weapon
functions as a Vorpal blade (see same reference as above), and gets the
+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Dreamoore's Blade Summoning (Conjuration/Summoning, Evocation)

Range: 0"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a 5' long shimmering blue shaft of force from the
caster's outstretched hands. He must physically wield the weapon in
combat, thus spells with somatic components cannot be cast while the
summoned blade exists. The "sword", however, has no true material
existence and does not conduct shock back to its wielder, thus its
overall speed factor is 1. It is neither an edged nor blunt weapon and
affects creatures normally immuned to either.

The blade strikes once per round with a +5 "to hit" bonus, inflicting
2d6 + 5 damage points per successful hit. It lasts 1 round per level of
the spell caster and is subject to disintegrate and dispel magic. The
material component is a 500 GP crystal sword which requires 2 weeks to
construct.

Dreamoore's Eldritch Decagon (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, the magic-user sets up a brilliant array of
pale blue, dancing rays which forms a decagon between both hands. The
spell draws power directly from the psychic winds of the astral and
ethereal plane. Once complete, it may fire a 1' wide beam of pure
magical force every round, and this ray unerringly strikes any single
creature or object within 10' per level (invisible targets require a
"to hit" roll vs. base AC 6, modified by dexterity, etc.) and inflicts
2-5 (1d4 + 1) damage points per level of the spell caster, up to 12d4 +
12 maximum. A successful save vs. spells halves damage. These beams may
be unleashed from the decagon:

- Eldritch beam: magic missile energy; affects only animate targets.
- Impaling force ray: inflicts piercing or impaling damage.
- Planar force beam: inflicts edged or slicing damage.
- Spherical force bolt: inflicts blunt or crushing damage.
- Vibration or shock wave: an ultrasonic bolt which affects only
crystal, glass, stone, and other objects vulnerable to vibration
damage.
- Wind blast: as the 3rd level magic-user spell, gust of wind, against
a single target (c.f. gust of wind)

The magic-user must concentrate to maintain the eldritch decagon, thus
any successful attack against him negates the spell. The material
component is a small crystal in the shape of a 10-sided die set inside
an iron ring, and a lodestone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Missile Tempest (Evocation)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Also known as "Dreamoore's bolts of seeking," this spell creates a
powerful enchanted bolt which has base 1d12 damage plus 3 points per
level of its caster, up to 1d12 + 36 maximum (e.g. a 12 hit die missile
does 37-48 hit points damage). This bolt, however, can divide into two
or more missiles striking single or multiple targets (minimum 1 damage
point per missile). Once the caster unleashes the bolt, he need but
point and close his fist. The missile then flashes outward, dividing
into smaller missiles if so directed, and unerringly hits all visible
targets in a 90 degree arc before the caster. The material component
for this spell is a 500 GP diamond which is hurled into the air as
spell casting is completed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dreamoore's Viper Lance (Alteration)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The viper lance spell launches a 2' long solid metal shaft at extremely
high velocity. This bolt always travels in a straight line trajectory,
its blinding speed making it near-invisible.  Any creature struck
immediately suffers base 1d10 + 2 HP's damage, up to 1d10 + 30
maximum.  The caster may launch one bolt per six experience level,
though only one bolt may be fired per round. The material component is
a solid steel shaft engraved with the caster's personal rune, with a
mithril or adamantine tip, and zinc stabilising fins. Each bolt requires
two weeks and 250 GP construction cost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eldarr's Improved Spell Conversion (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 2 turns
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Eldarr's Spell Conversion, except it will
convert any spell of level 6 or less to any known spell of level 5 or
lower.  The duration and casting time are also increased.

This spell also has the additional (in addition to the were-creature
pelt) spell component of a powdered gem (of any type) worth at least
400 GP. This gem is also consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Energy Field (Conjuration, Evocation)

Range: 6" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 5 rounds per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1' per level high cube
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an invisible field of energy which is impermeable to
the passage of magical and psionic energies through its barriers. Thus,
for example, creatures inside the area of effect are completely
unaffected by spells which are cast outside the spell area. Similarly
people outside are not effected by spells from inside (note, since
magic cannot pass through this barrier, creatures cannot teleport,
plane shift, etc. through the barrier).

Energy field does not, however, offer any physical protection
whatsoever.

Spells which cause physical damage can destroy the shield but these
spells must do a total damage of 6 HP per level of the caster. A
disintegrate spell will cause the shield to make a save vs. magic at
the level of the caster. If it saves then the spell has no effect. If
it fails then the spell does 2-9 points per level of the caster damage
to the field. A magic missile spell actually heals the field on a 1 to
1 hit point basis.

The shield, if cast upon the caster, moves with the caster. If the
spell is cast upon another unwilling creature then they make a save vs
spells. If they fail the save then the field follows the creature. If
the save is made then the spell becomes rooted to the target area.
Otherwise the spell remains stationary until the spell duration
expires.

The material component for this spell is a diamond cube of not less
than 500 GP value. This cube will shatter when the spell expires or the
field is brought down by spell damage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Arc (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is similar to the 1st level spell Burning Hands, but is much
more potent. When cast, this spell will emit an arc of flames from the
hand of the caster; the arc may be one of four sizes as listed on the
following table:

Arc		Range
~~~~~~~~~~~	~~~~~~~~
90 degrees	200 feet
180 degrees	150 feet
270 degrees	100 feet
360 degrees	50 feet

The arc of flames will have a width of one foot, centered on the
caster's hand, so the height of the wizard's hand at the time of
casting will determine the height of the flames; thus if the flames are
at waist level, it is possible to escape the effects of this spell if
lying prone.

The caster may elect to cast the arc in a "doughnut" shape; that is, he
may create an area around himself that is untouched by the flames (a
good idea if the caster is in the midst of a friendly party). The
radius of the hole may be any size the caster desires, up to half the
range as given in the table above.

Anyone hit by the flames suffers 4d10 points of damage, plus 1 point
per level of the caster (to a maximum of 4d10+20); a successful save
vs. spell reduces the damage by half. If a victim fails a save, all
possessions must save vs. magical fire or be consumed.

These flames are blocked by obstacles, and they will not rejoin behind
the barrier. This will create gaps in the arc; therefore, if a target
is standing behind a large enough obstacle, he will be shielded from
the flames, even if the blocking obstacle is tens of feet away.

The material component for this spell is a chunk of volcanic rock and a
lit candle; the rock is consumed with the casting, but the candle is
not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Dome (Evocation)

Range: 80 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the Wall of Fire spell, but it creates a dome
of flames instead of a wall. The dome has a radius along the ground of
10' plus 5' per level of the caster; it is 25' high at its peak. The
dome must be cast so its base is resting on solid ground.

Unlike a Wall of Fire, the Flame Dome gives off waves of heat on all
sides; anyone within 10' of the dome suffers 2d6 points of damage,
while those within 20' suffer 2d4 points of damage. In addition, the
dome inflicts 3d8 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the
caster on anyone who passes through the dome (like a Wall of Fire,
creatures subject to fire will suffer more damage at the DM's
discretion, and undead always suffer double damage).

The procedure for trapping creatures with the dome, as well as the
duration of the spell, are as per the Wall of Fire spell.

The material components for this spell are specimens of phosphorus and
sulphur, both of which are consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glamden's Acid Fire (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 5 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' x 5' per level cloud
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes an acid cloud to form anywhere within range of the
spell; the cloud billows out to its full dimensions (10' x 10' x 5' for
each level of the caster) instantaneously and everyone caught inside
the area of effect suffers 4d6 points of damage; a successful save vs.
spell reduces damage by half. Anyone who fails the save must roll saves
vs. acid for all possessions to avoid destruction.

Immediately after the acid cloud forms, it bursts into flames,
inflicting another 4d6 points of damage to all inside. As before, a
successful save vs.  spells reduces the damage by half; those
individuals who successfully saved vs.  the acid, receive a +4 bonus to
their save vs. the fire. If this second save fails, possessions must
save vs. magical fire or be consumed (the +4 bonus mentioned
previously, does not apply to these saves).

The material components for this spell are the intestines of a black
dragon and the heart of a red dragon; both are consumed when the spell
is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glamden's Acidic Gas (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 5 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10' x 10' x 5' per level cloud
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to Glamden's Acid Fire; when cast, this spell
forms a gas cloud which is also highly acidic; anyone caught inside the
cloud suffers 8d6 points of damage. This spell requires two saving
throws vs. spells: the first is against the gas, and the second is for
the acid. If neither save is successful, full damage is inflicted on
the victim; if one save is made and the second fails, the victim
suffers 3/4 damage; if both saves are successful, the victim suffers
1/2 damage. If the save vs. the acid fails, all possessions must save
vs. acid to avoid being destroyed; the gas has no effect on the
victim's possessions.

If a target has immunity vs. one component, damage is automatically
halved, and is reduced to 1/4 normal if the save vs. the other
component is successful.  Of course, it a target has immunity vs. both
components, he is not affected by this spell.

The material components for this spell are the intestines of a black
dragon and the stomach of a green dragon; both are consumed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Glamden's Gas Jet (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 5' wide, 10' per level long beam
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is similar to Glamden's other spells, Acid Fire and Acidic
Gas; when this spell is cast, a jet of green gas shoots from the
caster's palm; a split-second later, the gas erupts in flames. This jet
is 10 feet long per level of the caster, and is 5 feet wide; anyone hit
by the jet must make two saving throws vs. spell (one for the gas, and
the other against fire) to avoid suffering 8d6 points of damage. The
procedures for saves and immunity vs. the two components are the same
as for Glamden's Acidic Gas, except magical fire replaces the acid
component.

The material components for this spell are the heart of a red dragon
and the stomach of a green dragon; both are consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hold Person IV (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 5 persons in a 20' radius circle
Saving Throw: Negates

This is like hold person except as noted above and that all saving
throws are made with no modification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improved Wiley's Door (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is like that of Wiley's door except that there is no limit
to the amount of stuff that can be transported (except for the physical
problems of getting that much stuff through the door) and the second
door can be up to 20" distant. The second door must be somewhere that
the caster has seen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justin's Skimmer (Evocation)

Range: 20 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1/2 hour per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One skimmer
Saving Throw: None

An improved form of Tenser's floating disc, the skimmer is designed as
a flying vehicle for the caster.  The wizard reclines in a molded seat
at the centre of the 3' radius disc.  The "wings" each have room for
one person, or a comparable volume of cargo.  It can lift 50 pounds per
level of the caster.  The skimmer can move at speeds up to 25 miles per
hour (this approximates move 70), and has maneuverability class A at
speeds less than move 21.  The caster is protected from acceleration,
passengers are not.  When stopped, the skimmer can rotate on a dime.
The caster has full cover from below.  The skimmer can take 5 HP per
level of the caster.  Ramming, it does (move/3)d6 damage to both itself
and the target.  Only the caster can control the skimmer; it hovers
motionless if he is unconscious.  The skimmer is a stable casting
platform.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kalessin's Spell Load (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster is able to "store" one spell for every
three levels he possess (i.e. two at fourth, three at seventh, etc).
The caster "paints" the spells around himself as runes, in effect,
casting them, a process taking one turn per spell. The spells are now
"hung" around the caster, and can be released by command, an action
taking only 1/10 of a round.

If the caster concentrates, glowing runes representing the remaining
spells in the load will appear about the caster, visible only to the
caster. The caster must specify in the casting of the load what the
verbal or somatic commands are to be for the release of each spell. The
caster also determines the appearance of each representative rune.
Detect magic will reveal the presence of the spell load, and True Sight
will allow the caster to see the rune representations of the spells in
the load.

A spell load gets two saves versus a Dispel Magic cast at it. First, it
gets the mage's saving throw versus magic, and if that fails, it has a
100% chance of being dispelled, minus 5% for each level the spell load
caster has greater than that of the dispel magic caster.

Releasing the spells by command takes only 1/10 round for initiative
purposes, and the caster can release two spells per round, although, if
two spells are released, there is a (50 - caster's level) chance that
the load spell will be broken, and they will all go off. No more than
six spells can be set into a spell load.

Material components are a diamond tipped stylus, worth at least 1000
GP, and an amount of molten gold, with which the runes are painted. The
gold is consumed in the casting of the spell, but the stylus is still
usable. The runes are visible to all during the casting of the spell
load, and they flare briefly when the spell they represent is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lich's Palm (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell actually grants the caster the ability to use the normal
attack of a lich. The mere touch will cause 1d10 damage of cold and be
paralysed (save applicable).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Stasis (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell was designed as either a sort of temporal stasis effect, or
as a way of removing enemies without killing them. The creature touched
is placed into its own extra-dimensional space, where no time passes.
After one turn for each level of the caster has elapsed, the creature
will be returned to the Prime Material plane in exactly the same state
it was when the spell is cast (including location).

If an object has been placed in the location from which the creature
was sent, the subject will be displaced the shortest possible distance
in any direction consonant with emerging in open space. For instance,
if the tunnel has collapsed since the spell was cast, the creature
might be displaced a few tens of yards up to the surface of the earth,
if this is the shortest displacement that will allow the creature to be
placed in an open area. However, if there should happen to be a cavity
in the debris blocking the tunnel, the subject would most likely be
deposited there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mage Lock (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful dweomer causes the sealing of a thing with far greater
effectiveness than that caused by a Hold Portal or a Wizard Lock
spell.  The Mage Lock can only be cast on certain things:  Boxes or
chests made of iron, steel, or harder metals, or on doors made of the
same and set into a wall at least as hard as hard stone.

When the Mage Lock spell is cast, the Wizard chooses a single person -
other than himself - who is to be able to open the sealed box, chest,
or door.  When the spell is done the item is sealed and only the
individual who was named in the casting will be able to open it.  The
item will be unaffected by Knock spells, Chimes of Opening, or similar
magics, and will have a Magic Resistance of 25% with regard to other
magics, and a +2 on all saves.

If the person named in the spell should die before the item is opened -
for the spell holds only until the item is opened once - then the item
cannot be opened by anyone until the caster of the spell is dead.  If
the item has not been opened by the time both the wizard and the person
named die, the Mage Lock dissipates.

The material components of this spell are:  A diamond, worth no less
than 5,000 GP, 4 small iron cubes, and a drop of blood from the person
to be named in the spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mass Teleport (Alteration)

Range: 1' per level radius
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is basically a higher level of the fifth level Teleport
spell. The main difference lies in the amount of mass that can be
transported by the caster. In addition to the caster, 1200 pounds per
level over level 10 may be transported. Basically, this spell is for
bulk rate transfers of material. The range simply refers to the maximum
radius outward from the center of effect (usually the caster) that
people and things can be to be teleported.

This was a very popular spell with parties of adventurers that had
lots of money to spend on transportation... As such, the mages who
could cast this spell tended to charge through the nose for it... It's
not an easy spell to find since it is very, very useful... Of course,
it's just a matter of time before somebody else (or a group of others)
break into the action by researching a similar spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minor Accursed Rite (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One living creature
Saving Throw: Negates

Turns victim into an undead, type selected randomly wight, ...,
vampire, partially controllable by the caster. Risky: each command
given is a chance for the victim to become a fully free undead of the
type, unless the caster also is a member of the same type of undead.
Free - until controlled by a spell, of course. The change takes place
over a period of two weeks of gradually worsening illness in which time
the spell can be dispelled by a Dispel Magic, Cure Disease, and Heal,
cast in any order any time during the two weeks, not necessarily one
straight after the other. The DM should make up some appropriate
material component.

Note: the spell can create some quite weird undeads, such as vampire
snakes. Controlling requires a common language and sufficient
intelligence on the part of the target. The spell in itself doesn't
modify stats such as intellect, even if the undead strength of 18/00 on
a vampire does apply to non-humanoids as well.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moloranis's Marvelous Map (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: Special (see below)
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: One sheet of paper
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the mage is able to draw a fairly well detailed
map of the surrounding terrain onto blank paper, which is the material
component for this spell. The mage casting this spell must give total
concentration to the spell for the entire 10 minutes. If the mage loses
his concentration, the partially drawn map will fade from view and the
spell must be repeated.

The range of this spell varies as follows:

Above the ground: 1 mile per level of the caster.
Underground: 100 feet per level of the caster.

* Inside a structure: The mage will get a detailed map of the floor or
  level he is on. However, the map will show nothing beyond the outer
  walls. If the floor or level is bigger than the mage's maximum
  radius, then follow the underground rule.

While this spell is very handy, it does have some draw-backs. Nothing
on the map is labeled. Also, the map will not show people. For
instance, the map will show where a town is (if it is in range) but it
won't give you the name of that town and it won't tell you if there are
any people in the town. In other words, this spell results in a
terrain-like map.

The material component for this spell is a piece of paper (or something
like that) and a writing instrument of some kind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Improved Backlash (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Mystyk's Backlash except for the following:
when the caster is hit in melee, if he makes a successful save vs.
rods, the attack only inflicts half normal damage (rounded down).
Also, the energy bursts inflict an additional point of damage per level
of the caster, up to a maximum of 20; this damage is halved if the
attacker successfully saves vs.  spells. For example if a 14th level
caster is hit with a melee attack for 12 points of damage, the caster
would suffer 12 points of damage, or 6 if the save is successful; the
attacker would suffer 12 + 14 = 26 points of damage, or 13 if the save
succeeds.

The material component for this spell is the same as that for Mystyk's
Backlash except the gem must be worth at least 600 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quintessa's Slaying Spear (Evocation)

Range: 2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, light, that appears as a chromatic mass of
intertwined rays bundled together in the shape of a spear, appears
above the casters head.

The caster goes through the motion of throwing the spear, without ever
touching it, while speaking the name and race of the creature to be
slain.

The spear then flies towards its target and will kill the creature
instantly is a save vs. death magic is failed. The spear never misses.

If the saving throw is successful, the spear misses the creatures
brain, or central nervous system, and instead hits another part of of
the body causing 10-80 + 1 HP per level of the caster damage. The surge
of energy into the creature will also stun it for 2-8 rounds.

For the spell to work to its fullest potential, certain things should
be known about the target: (1) race (2) anatomy (3) true name - if
applicable - and (4) general background and history of the creature. If
any of these are known (or not known) then the creatures saving throw
is modified as follows:

Information	Saving Throw adjustments
-----------	------------------------
		Known		Unknown
		--------	-------
race		-1		+2
anatomy		-1 to -4	+3
true name	-4		+2
knowledge	-1 to -5	+3

The saving throw modifier because of knowledge of the creatures anatomy
depends on how much the caster has studied the creatures species. As a
general guide, it would take about one month of study, along with lots
of specimens, to be completely familiar with a certain species
anatomy.

The saving throw modifier because of knowledge of the creatures
background depends on how much and how deeply the creature's history
and current life was researched.

The material component for this spell is a copper spearhead and a glass
or crystal prism. If the creature was killed because of a failed saving
throw, then the spearhead will be found in the brain. If the save was
made, then the spearhead will be found in a random part of the body.

There is an additional -2 to save modifier if, for some obscure reason,
the creature is resubject to this spell with the same copper spearhead
that was used the first time (the spearhead has learned where to go
this time).

The prism disappears after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Replay (Divination, Illusion)

Range: 6"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 2" x 2" area
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes past events to be re-enacted in the area of effect.
The replayed events will consist of a three dimensional,
semi-transparent image superimposed over the area of effect.

The caster can freeze the action, reverse it, scan forward for a
particular event, or skip to any time within the range of the spell as
given in the table below.

Level	Time Range
-----	---------------
12-14	1 day per level
15-17	1 month per level
18-20	1 year per level
21+	1 century per level

The speed of a search is determined by the event that is sought. The
passage of an army would be easy to spot at a fast search rate, while
searching for a pickpocket would require a real time search.

The material component for this spell is an hourglass.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Retroactive Dispel Magic (Abjuration, Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous

Lets you actually cast Dispel Magic to counter a spell thrown at you!
If you have the spell, you can cast it at any spell or spell effect
thrown that round, even if you have been killed or turned to stone, by
the vagaries of initiative and the like. It is assumed that you were
casting the Dispel Magic as the other spell was being cast. Acts as
Dispel Magic for chance of success based on level.

For example, you have Esmeralda cast Polymorph Other, which is lots
faster than Dispel Magic. She has Initiative all over Glamgon, the PC.
He declares that he wants to cast retroactive Dispel Magic, so
effectively as Esmeralda was gathering power for her spell, Glamgon was
trying to drain it away. Glamgon had better succeed, lest he truly
become a toad (the outcome of the polymorph other should Retroactive
Dispel Magic not succeed).

Note that this spell cannot be cast by a specialised Abjurer or
Transmuter, since it (also) belongs to his opposite school.

Sarius' Frost Giant Manifestation (Conjuration)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 6 turns
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a golem-like creature which the mage may direct to
perform certain programmed actions. The creature is a temporary ice
golem with no true intelligence, and to most appears as an undead frost
giant. The creature may be controlled up to a distance equal to the
spell range but if it passes outside of this range, or the spellcaster
is killed, the creature will explode in a 60' radius area doing damage
equal to its current hit points (save vs. breath weapon for half
damage). The creature created mimics most of the actions of a frost
giant, having AC 4, MV 12", HD 10 + 2, HP 52, AT 1, DM 4-24, SP:
Immune to cold, SZ: L (15'), Strength: 21. The creature can fight with
its club only and has no ability to hurl rocks as a normal frost giant.
It can inflict structural damage points as a normal frost giant on a
round to round basis (Wood: 2, Soft Stone: 1, Hard Rock: 1/2).

The caster is able to direct the creature to perform 3 individual
actions plus 1 for every two levels of experience above 12th level.
Each change in action will cause the creature to hesitate for one round
before working to act out the next action. Actions can be classed as
"killing a group of orcs", "killing a group of men wearing the same
colours or armour", "tearing down a stone wall", "pulling up a tree",
etc. Once the final action is completed the frost giant crumbles into
small shards of ice, effectively making a circular area 30' in diameter
very slippery. Against mind affecting spells, the creature is
considered to have an intelligence and wisdom of 3 (saving at -3 vs.
these attacks). If the creature is charmed or controlled by a mind
affecting spell the casters concentration is totally disrupted causing
the creature to dissipate and any other spells the caster currently
controls will become dispelled unless the caster has no control over
the spells in question after casting them, and any spell the caster is
currently casting will be disrupted.

This spell requires only the slightest mental control of the caster to
operate, allowing him to cast other spells normally that do not require
his full concentration. Multiple castings of this spell will work, but
all of the detrimental effects are cumulative. The material component
of this spell is a small pouch (2" squared) of leather containing a
patch of fresh (not dried) frost giant hair mixed with diamond dust of
no less than 500 GP value. The frost giant hair may be kept fresh with
a Preserve spell or similar effect.

Sarius' Platinum Platform (Alteration, Enchantment)

Range: 1/2" per level
Components: VSM
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings a magical force field into existence which resembles
a dimly glowing platform made of glass-like material. The glowing
platform (dimly visible up to 5' away in daylight) is capable of flying
under the control of the spellcaster, who may carry himself and a
certain amount of weight through airy and waterous mediums. When
casting this spell, the mage may choose to create a 10' x 10' with 6"
sidewalls or a 40' x 40' platform with 3' sidewalls. The 10' x 10'
platform looses some of the abilities of the 40' x 40', but is 10%
magic resistant and confers a 5% magic resistance to anything in
physical contact with the platform. Both platforms have a localised
gravity that aids in keeping materials on board and bonuses to
dexterity checks for falling from it. The differences between platforms
and general flight powers are listed in the table below. Note that this
spell uses the intelligence of the creature casting the spell to
determine usage (even thieves) and creatures with less than a 9
intelligence may not effectively use this spell. Only mages may create
the 10' x 10' platform.

The platforms may only be destroyed by magical damage. Physical
attacks, no matter how strong, will only be able to move the platform
in relation to the force of the attack compared to the current speed
and/or lift rate. Magical weapons will do damage equal to their magical
plusses only. If area of effect attacks come from below that do not
destroy the platform they will not affect the contents of the platform.
Note that, even if the magic resistance of a 10' x 10' platform is
bridge and it fails its saving throw and takes full damage, unless it
is destroyed the aforementioned effect holds true. The magic resistance
passed onto objects touching the platform stay in effect for one round
after it is destroyed. Breath weapons are considered magical attacks
cast at the level of the hit dice of the breathing creature for
determining magic resistance breach.

The 40' x 40' platform may sustain 3 HP per level of the originating
experience level at which it was cast, while the 10' x 10' platform
will take 4 x this amount of damage. The platform is immune to any
attacks which use a primal force of the plane in which it is created
(e.g., fire in the elemental plane of fire) since it is created from
the forces of the current plane in which it resides. This also prevents
the platform from crossing planar boundaries. In places where there is
no localised gravity, movement rates are double the stated values in
the table below. Spell duration in normal time is 1 turn per level for
the 10' x 10' platform and 1 day per level for the 40' x 40' platform.
The material component of this spell is a platinum plate (3" x 5" x
1/2") with mystic runes etched into it. A jeweler is needed (unless the
character has the skill) and he will charge no less than 500 GP to work
the runes needed into the plate, the total price coming to 4,000 GP for
the plate. The caster must use a wizard mark of his own to prepare the
plate or it will only be able to create the 40' x 40' platform.

25	25"	2,500	3"	A/+3	12.5"	10,000	1.5"	C/+6

Maximum Speed:
This is measured in feet per round indoors and yards per round
outdoors. Incapacitating the controlling person causes the platform to
freeze.  Speed also directly converts to miles per hour when the
platform is flown for that amount of time.

Maximum Weight:
This is measured in pounds.

Maximum (Rate of) Lift:
For every 100 pounds over the maximum weight limit the lift rate is
reduced by 1" per round. Negative lift rates cause the platform to go
down at a rate equal to the negative rating unless the current plane
has no gravity. In this case movement rate is affected vice lift.

MCFA (Maneuverability Class - Falling Adjustment):
This bonus is doubled for the caster controlling the platform. Each +1
should be considered a pull each to 1/10th of normal gravity in the
current plane of existence.  These plusses are specifically bonuses
against falling off of the platform.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Sillvatar's Surgical Strike (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell provides the caster with a method of attacking a specific
target in the midst of a crowd; when this spell is cast, a flaming bolt
shoots from the palm of the caster towards the intended victim. Only
one target may be chosen for this spell, and the bolt strikes this
individual unerringly. The bolt will dodge obstructions and other
creatures in its flight to the target; it will even round corners, if
need be. As long as the spell's range is not exceeded, and there is
some path to the target, it will be struck; even if the victim ducks
behind an obstacle while the spell is being cast, the bolt will still
strike home. The only stipulation is the target must be in sight when
the spell incantations begin; the caster may choose any target within
sight (and range) but may not target such things as "the strongest
member of the group" or "the orc leader" (see the description for Magic
Missile for more details).

When the bolt impacts the target, it explodes in a burst of flames that
engulf the victim; the flames conform to the shape of the target, so no
other creatures are affected by the spell unless they are touching the
victim. The affects of the explosion are identical to a 10 die Fireball
(10d6 points of damage). A successful save vs. spell reduces the damage
by one half. If this save fails, the target must save vs. magical fire
at -3 for all possessions; those that fail are destroyed.

Since its inception, this spell has become a favourite of assassins;
because of this, Sillvatar has striven to remove it from circulation.
Due to his efforts, this spell is not as common as it once was,
although tens and even hundreds of examples still exist.

The material component for this spell is a handful of scales and the
heart of a red dragon; these components are consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spell-link (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 3d4 hours + 1 hour per level
Casting time: 5 rounds
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

By use of this spell, the mage magically links 4 spells that are
currently in his memory. The link is such that, upon uttering a trigger
phrase, the linked spells are invoked almost simultaneously. That is,
they are machine-gunned. In actual time: there is a 2/10 round gap
between the spells.

The spells that can be linked are one first level spell, one second
level, one third level and one fourth level. The mage must specify the
order of the link (i.e. 1-3-4-2, 2-1-3, etc). Spells that are linked
may not be cast. Any attempt to cast a linked spell has an 85% chance
to fizzle (minus 10% per point of intelligence above 15). Furthermore,
the other spells linked to the cast spell are automatically lost.

The trigger phrase takes 1/10 round to use. At the end of the duration,
which is secretly rolled by the GM, this spell and the linked spells
are automatically lost.

Spell components are a braided platinum & copper chain, worth 500 GP,
which is consumed by the spell, and - obviously - whatever is needed
for the linked spells.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff of Light/Darkness (Alteration, Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the magic-user creates a powerful magical
weapon which only he can wield. Magic-users of Good alignment can
create a Staff of Light; those of Evil alignment, a Staff of Darkness;
and those of Neutral alignment (with respect to Good/Evil) can create
either form of the spell, but with reduced effectiveness. The verbal
component of this spell consists of but a single word, which creates in
the magic-user's hand a sphere of light (or darkness) a few inches in
diameter; the remainder of the casting time is then spent carefully
pulling and shaping this sphere into a full-sized staff. Spell duration
is considered to begin on the following round, so that the caster can
make at least as many attacks as he has levels.

The glowing Staff of Light will brightly illuminate a 30' radius, and
when cast by a Good-aligned magic-user this illumination will be
painful to supernatural Evil creatures such as undead, demons, devils,
etc. (these take 2 hit points of damage per round, saving vs. spell
each round for half damage). A Darkness spell cast in the area of the
Staff of Light will eliminate this painful effect for the duration of
the Darkness, but does not actually make the area dark, though the
illumination is reduced to the level of dim torchlight.

Whether cast by a Good or Neutral magic-user, the Staff of Light
strikes as a +2 weapon (for purposes of what can be hit by it; there is
no actual to-hit bonus) and does a base of 1d6 points of damage. The
damage can be increased by 1d6 for each round of spell duration that
remains; every such increase shortens the duration of the spell by one
round. Intent to increase damage must be stated before the to-hit die
is rolled, but spell duration is not affected if the attack is a miss.
If the Staff of Light is used to strike a creature with a strong
Negative Material existence (wights, spectres, xeg-yi, etc.) there is a
50% chance that the remaining spell duration will be expended as damage
whether or not the caster wishes it.

The Staff of Darkness sheds deep shadows in a 30' radius, through which
only the caster can see clearly; Shades (the monster) and other
magic-users using Staff of Darkness spells are at -1 to hit when within
these shadows, and all others (even with infravision) are at -3 to hit
and +3 to be hit when in these shadows (note that two magic-users
within 30' of each other and each holding as Staff of Darkness will
both be at -1 to hit, but the effects of multiple staves are not
otherwise cumulative).

In addition, when cast by an Evil-aligned magic-user, this sphere of
shadow will affect supernatural creatures of Good alignment (shedu,
lammasu, devas, etc.) as if they were affected by a Stinking Cloud
spell (saving throw vs. magic reduces the effect to mild nausea, -1 to
hit and damage; this penalty is cumulative with the -3 to-hit penalty
for poor visibility). A Light spell cast in the area of the Staff of
Darkness will remove this nauseating effect and reduce the to-hit
penalty to -1 and the to-be-hit penalty to +1, but will not
significantly brighten the area.

The staff of Darkness strikes as a +2 weapon (for purposes of what can
be hit), doing 1d6 points of damage. For each round of spell duration
that remains, the caster can choose to inflict numbing cold on his
victim; this cold has a 5% chance per round of spell duration expended,
cumulative, of causing loss of use of a limb for 1d6 rounds, and
otherwise causes the victim to lose one point each of strength and
dexterity per round of duration expended, also for 1d6 rounds;
thereafter the lost strength and dexterity return at the rate of one
point each per round, or the limb becomes usable immediately.
Cold-resistant and cold-using creatures get a saving throw against this
effect, and its duration is halved for them in any case.

If the areas of radiance/shadow of a Staff of Light and a Staff of
Darkness intersect, the effects of both are negated in the overlapping
region. If the staves are within 30' of one another, both cease to shed
their light/darkness, but their powers are otherwise unaffected.
Neither Staff has any physical substance, and thus cannot be parried
except by another Staff of the opposite type or by a Rod of Force; a
Wall of Force, Forcecage, or similar force barrier will stop a Staff.
If two Staves of opposite type touch one another for any reason, both
are destroyed in an explosion of 40' radius causing 1d6 points damage
for each round of duration remaining in the two spells, cumulative. The
mages holding the Staves automatically take full damage, all others
within 40' save vs. spells to take half damage.

The material component of this spell is a pearl (a black pearl for the
Dark version) of not less than 500 GP value, which is held in one hand
when the command word is uttered. The pearl is transformed into a small
sphere of light or darkness; the somatic component is the stretching
and molding of this sphere into a staff. There is rumoured to be a
variant of this spell that allows the sphere formed from the pearl to
be hurled as a missile, but the specific details have been lost.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Trap (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 10-yard per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: Negates

All people or things teleporting in the area of effect are, upon
materialising, effected as if a paralysis spell had been cast upon them
(as in players handbook). Thus a mage wishing to leave sneak into a
place decides to teleport there.  He doesn't realise that a Teleport
Trap has been cast however around the spot he wishes to appear.  Upon
arriving he must save vs. spells or be paralysed.  Those leaving an
area under this spell will also be paralysed whereever they appear.

Material components are a gem of not less than 5000 GP worth smeared
with the ichor of some paralysing agent (ghoul's skin, etc).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport via Fire (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: One creature per 4 levels
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the caster to teleport himself and/or others from one
area of flames to another (both fires must be at least as large as a
small campfire). The caster has two options: if the terminal fire is in
sight, the teleport is without error as per the spell of the same name;
if the target fire is not in sight, then the teleport is subject to the
success modifiers of the normal Teleport spell. Obviously, the location
of the terminal fire must be known (via scrying or prior knowledge). If
this spell is used when there is no known target fire (i.e. there is no
fire in sight and none are known to the caster) the recipients are
trapped on the elemental plane of fire (note that this provides a way
of entering this plane on a planned basis, but the caster will not know
the location of the teleport beforehand, unless there is prior
knowledge of the location on the plane of fire).

This spell will provide the recipients with a form of fire-resistance:
this resistance lasts for one round per 2 levels of the caster; it
provides total protection for this time (but only for the two fires in
question - the recipients are affected normally by other fires during
this time).

It takes 2 turns to prepare this spell, but once prepared, it will
remain in effect for one hour per level of the caster, or until it is
used. The creatures to be affected are named at the time of
preparation. The spell has an actual casting time (i.e. to trigger the
teleport) of 1.

This spell provides a method of escaping the effects of a Fireball or
similar spell: if the caster makes the proper saving throw, and is not
in the midst of some other activity (i.e casting another spell or
fighting), the teleport can be triggered instantly; the teleported
creatures are unaffected by the Fireball regardless if they make their
saves or not. Of course the normal stipulations are still in effect, so
the caster must still have a target fire, or be trapped on the plane of
fire.

The material components for this spell are a candle and the replica of
a small, wooden door; both are consumed with the casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vandergast's Armoured Forcetrap (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell is identical to Vandergast's Forcetrap in appearance and
effect, with the following exceptions: a bend bars attempt is useless
against this spell; instead, enough damage must be inflicted on the
bands to destroy them. This damage may be caused by weapons (piercing
and slashing weapons only do half damage, blunt weapons inflict full
damage) or spells. Also, only one target may be trapped by this spell.
Finally, a Limited Wish will not affect this spell, although a Wish
will destroy it, and a Dispel Magic has the normal chance of success
against the bands.

The bands have AC 0 and 5 hit points for every level of the caster.
When the bands' hit point total has been exceeded, the bands are
destroyed, and the spell ends. Each attack that inflicts damage on the
bands will also inflict half that damage total (rounded down) on the
trapped victim unless a successful save vs. paralysation is made (in
which case, no damage is suffered). For example, if the bands are
struck for 11 points of damage, they suffer the full 11 points, while
the trapped victim suffers 5 points of damage, unless his save was
successful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wizard Watch (Alteration, Divination)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One room
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a special version of the casters Wizard Mark to
placed in a room of the casters choice. This sigil will allow the
caster to view the room from any distance as if the caster was scrying
into the room with no chance of failure. The sigil itself does not do
the seeing, but it only defines the room that can be viewed, thus the
caster can view the room from any viewpoint inside the room, but not
from outside the room. The information received is limited to visual
only.

Since the sigil is easily noticed, it can be hidden, or have its design
mixed in with the decor of the room and be hidden that way.

If the sigil is created in an outside area, not bounded by walls, then
the viewpoint can be anywhere within a 1" radius from the location of
the sigil.

Any creatures that are in the room which is actively being watched will
have a chance to detect the scrying of the owner as defined the DMG
(pg. 141). If they use a dispel magic to counter the scrying, then the
sigil will remain inoperative for a period of one day (this does not
mean that the caster might not have more sigils in the room. As long as
they remain inactivated, they will not be effected by the Dispel
Magic).

The spell is permanent until the sigil is tampered with, or destroyed.

The materials for this spell is a mercury and 1000 GP of carbuncle dust
is a glue base as well as a dragon scale with the sigil carved on it.
The mix is poured onto the dragon scale 'mold' and pressed against the
area where the sigil is to be put. The spell is cast, and the new sigil
remains in place.

Seventh Level Spells

========================================================================

Chaos Environment (Alteration)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is exactly the same as Chaos Vision except that the
environment actually is changing uncontrollably.  The ground constantly
rolls and twists, objects from the casters mind appear and disappear.
All creatures in the environment are constantly polymorphing.  Note
that creatures polymorphed will need to save vs. spells each round to
keep their former identity and not take on a new one.  All damage from
being crushed, attacked, and otherwise affected by the spell are real,
caused by real creatures and aberrations in the area.  I usually give
1d6 of damage per round due to constantly being battered and thrown.
DM's can give whatever they like however as needed by the alteration
that caused the damage.

A person entering this environment had best carry nothing with him or
risk losing it as it turns into some form which might not be
carryable.  People have to make system shock rolls every turn, for the
stresses will tear even the mightiest hero apart, given time.

The material component of this spell is a Wild Magic area, which is
consumed by the spell.  The area of effect fills the area previously
formed by the Wild Magic area.

The one Chaos Environment in my campaign was formed to protect an
artifact that caused as much harm as good.  A lesser magic item would
have eventually been destroyed by the constant polymorphing and
impacts.  All objects will revert to their original form if they can
get out of the area of effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Mummy (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4 hours
Area of Effect: One corpse
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates one mummy from the corpse of a human of at least
seventh level fighting ability. The mummy follows orders to the limit
of its low intelligence, but it must remain within one mile of its
place of origin, so it is primarily useful only as a guardian. The
corpse of the potential mummy must be properly embalmed with the
appropriate proficiency (q.v.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create Undead (Necromancy)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting time: 1 day
Area of Effect: One human corpse
Saving throw: Special (see below)

The material components of this spell are a human corpse (not older
than 3 days), myrrh (500 GP worth) and a special balm made of certain
rare herbs, personally prepared by the necromancer. Ingredients for
this balm cost 500 GP, and one uninterrupted week spent by the spell
caster. The balm only stays good for 3 days.

This spell forces back the soul of the corpse, and turns it into either
a wight, a spectre, or a wraith. The caster has a percentage chance
equal to his level x 2 of choosing which is created. Otherwise, roll on
the following table, adding the level of the caster, plus a 5 bonus if
the caster is a necromancer specialist. Also, if the corpse was a
0-level person, subtract 30 from the roll (if the adjusted roll is
below 0, the spell fails and the corpse is destroyed).

1-60	wight
61-90	wraith
91-00	spectre

The corpse gets a saving throw vs. magic, at a level equal to the
corpses level before death, with the following bonuses:

person was good  		+ 4
person was neutral		+ 1
person was a not-good cleric	+ 2
person was a good cleric	+ 4

If the save is made, the corpse is destroyed and the spell fails. If
the save is failed, the undead is created. Said undead will be under
the control of the necromancer for one year, following any order that
is not obviously suicidal. At the end of the year, or upon such time as
the undead receives a suicidal order, it is freed from the
necromancer's control and gets a save vs. magic. If it fails, it must
leave and may never attack the necromancer unless attacked first. If it
succeeds, it becomes free-willed, and might attack the necromancer if
it was sufficiently mistreated.

Note that after the year is up, the undead may continue to serve the
necromancer, if it was sufficiently prosperous and receives a
sufficient bribe. This is a GM call.

A necromancer can only control 1 undead in this matter at a time. At
the end of the year, or when the undead dies or becomes uncontrolled,
the spell may be used again. Should this spell be used during the year,
it will work, but the fresh undead will immediately attack the
spellcaster.

Finally, a created undead starts out the same alignment as the corpse
from which it came. However, due to what these creatures must feed on
(i.e. people), an unstoppable shift begins towards the undead's normal
alignment. There is a 10% chance per month (cumulative) of the
alignment decaying one step. After a switch, the chance returns to 0
and begins building again.

Deflect Magic Weapon Attacks (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the fifth level spell deflect normal weapon
attacks with the following exceptions: the forcefield's AC is 2 and it
has 7 hit points per level of the caster. It affects all attacks made
via a magical or non-magical melee or missile weapon. A non-magical
weapon cannot affect or penetrate the barrier in any way. If a magical
weapon strikes the barrier, the target's saving throw (to determine
penetration or deflection) has a penalty applied to it equal to the
bonus of the weapon (i.e. a +2 weapon that scores a hit on the barrier
inflicts a -2 penalty on the protected creature's save). Also, if a
magical weapon is reflected back at the attacker (when the barrier is
not hit), the weapon bonus is not applied to the reflected attack.

In addition to its other powers, this spell may affect magic missile
attacks. It does not automatically negate them as a shield spell does,
but causes the attacker to make a "to hit" roll vs. the barrier. If the
attack succeeds, the barrier automatically takes damage (the recipient
earns no save); if the attacker fails to score a hit, the magic missile
has no effect. Other spells will pass through the barrier, without
affecting it. The material component for this spell is a powdered
black sapphire which is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delayed Blast Snowball (Evocation)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 2" radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a snowball (q.v.) with +1 on each of its dice of
damage. The spell will not release its burst for 1 to 50 segments
(1/10 to 5 rounds), according to the command upon casting. In other
respects, this spell is the same as the third level spell snowball [cf.
Delayed Blast Fireball]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Electrosphere (Evocation)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1/4" per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell is a more potent version of the second level spell
Shocksphere. This spell is almost identical in its effects, but the
effects are much more spectacular, and far more deadly.

When this version of Shocksphere explodes, the little Lightning Bolts
are much more powerful, being able to push or throw objects around
during the segment that the spell lasts. Therefore, not all the damage
is caused by the electricity, one quarter of the damage caused is
caused by the force of the blows of the Lightning Bolts (this means
that creatures with protection from electrical attacks will still take
damage from this spell).

If there is a creature which is the target for the spell, its saving
throw will be at -4 and it will take (2-8 + 1 per level of the caster)
damage from the lightning when the spell "explodes". All other
creatures in the area of effect will take 2-7 damage per level of the
caster in hit points if they fail a normal saving throw vs. spells. If
a creature does fail its saving throw, then all their objects must make
their saves vs. the worst of either lightning or crushing blow.

If this spell expands in an area which is smaller than its diameter, it
will conform to the volume it occupies, filling a volume of ((caster's
level * 0.25)3 * 4 * c / 3) cubic feet.

Unlike Shocksphere, this spell will do structural damage to any
man-made or natural structure in the area of effect. It will do 1 point
of structural damage to wooden constructions, half that to those of
soft stone, and only one quarter that to those of hard stone per level
of the caster.

The material components of this spell is a small chunk of flesh from a
blue dragon, or any other similarly powered creature that uses
electricity for its principal attack, and a small wand of gold (50 GP
value). Both these materials disappear after the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eye of the Beholder (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

In order to cast this spell, the wizard must have in his possession, an
eye stalk from a beholder. The stalk is pointed at the intended
victim(s), and after the incantations are complete, one of 10 possible
effects shoot forth from the eye stalk towards the target(s).  The
exact result (including saving throws, range, duration, etc.) are
determined at random from among the 10 functions of a beholder's eye
stalks, as given in the Monstrous Compendium. The eleventh eye function
(anti-magic ray) is never one of the spell results.

The only material component for this spell is the eye stalk, which is
used up when the spell is cast. In order to achieve different effects,
an eye stalk from a spectator, gauth, or an eye of the deep may be
substituted for the beholder's stalk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Fog (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 40' wide, 20' high, 20' deep cloud
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates a fog resembling that produced by a Cloudkill spell;
the cloud may be created up to 10 yards away, and moves 10 feet per
round as directed by the caster; strong winds will move the cloud in
another direction, but will not disperse it, nor will they move the
cloud back towards the caster.  Thick vegetation will break up the
cloud in 3 rounds.

The fog itself is not harmful, and has no other affect besides
obscuring vision. During any round after the spell is cast, the caster
may ignite the fog with a single word. When this is done, the entire
fog cloud becomes a roaring sheet of flames inflicting 5d10 points of
damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster (up to a maximum of
5d10+20) to those caught inside. A successful save vs. spell reduces
the damage by half. Those victims who fail their saves must roll for
all their possessions vs. magical fire; those items that fail their
saves are destroyed.

If any type of fire comes into contact with the fog cloud, it ignites
immediately; if a Fireball, or similar spell, is cast into the cloud,
the damage inflicted is cumulative, and a saving throw for each effect
must be made separately.

The material components for this spell are several strands of hair from
a cloud giant, and the scales of a red dragon; all components are
consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Flesh to Toast (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell turns the flesh of any creature affected into a golden-brown
piece of hot yummy toast.  Only the victim is affected; anything the
victim may be wearing (or non-organic items ingested) will not be
turned into toast.  The resultant toast is subject to any forces normal
toast is subject to (slicing, buttering, eating, whatever).  One cubic
foot of toast will satisfy the appetites of four humans, although they
may get tired of toast way before then.

The material components of this spell are a small pat of butter or
cream cheese, and 1 foot of steel wire.  The steel wire will not be
consumed in the casting.

Note that this spell is not reversible.  The effects can only be
countered with a Wish or Limited Wish spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Improved Armour Reversal (Abjuration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level, minus 7 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is an improved version of the fifth level "Jamye's Armour
Reversal" spell.  With this spell, bonuses "to hit" by the attacker are
added to the die roll (thus working against the attacker) instead of
subtracted.  For example, a 10th-level fighter attacking an AC 5 mage
with Improved Armour Reversal would need a die roll of 5 or less to hit
the mage; if the fighter had a Strength of 17 (+1 "to hit") and a +2
weapon, she would now need a die roll of 2 or less (5 minus 1, minus 2)
to hit the mage.

This spell also affects missile weapons in the same way it affects
melee weapons, unlike the fifth level spell.  Also, whereas Armour
Reversal can be dispelled by a subsequent casting of Improved Armour
Reversal on the same subject, Improved Armour Reversal cannot be so
dispelled by the weaker spell.  If Armour Reversal is cast upon the
subject of a previous Improved Armour Reversal spell, the Armour
Reversal spell is wasted and has no effect.

The spell components for this spell are a small magnet, a piece of
black silk of no less than 20 GP value, and a diamond of no less than
250 GP value.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Llewllynn's Wall of Force (Evocation)

Range: 3"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10 square feet per level
Saving Throw: None

This spell is equivalent to the fifth level mage spell wall of force
(q.v.) in all respects save one: the caster is able to manipulate the
force wall. The following variations are possible:

Version 1: The mage can cast the wall in a hemispherical or spherical
shape around himself with himself as the centre point. The mage can
then move about and the wall will move with him. This version is tinted
red.

Version 2: The mage can cast the spell as a wall (2-dimensional
barrier) and then move in a direction with the wall moving 1" to 3" in
front of him. The wall will always be in front of the caster, and will
turn as he turns. This version is tinted blue. Note that this version
cannot be cast horizontally.

The material component for version one is a pinch of diamond dust and a
pinch of ruby dust. The material component for version two is a pinch
of diamond dust and a pinch of sapphire dust.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Quench (Abjuration, Alteration)

Range: 5 feet per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1-foot per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a sphere that has all the properties of a Forgotten
Realms (tm) dead magic area (see the FR Sourcebook for details).  The
area of dead magic is permanent until destroyed (it may only be
destroyed as per a dead magic area).  The sphere of dead magic is
non-mobile.

The material component for this spell is a pint of blood from any
recently slain magic-using creature.  The blood is consumed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mind Find (Divination)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 100' radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This is an extremely powerful version of true sight combined with a
form of clairvoyance. Like true sight, it allows the caster to exactly
locate people that are: displaced, invisible, polymorphed, change,
enchanted, or illusioned. However the spells effects the mind, not the
eyes of the caster, so the caster can in addition see through fog,
around corners, trees, etc. (anything within 100' radius).

About the only things that will block the penetration power are the
Non-detection spell (non-detection gets a save to see if the mind find
worked on him), Lead walls, or walls of force. The spell also confers
the ability to perceive minds in 360 degrees on all axis, X, Y and Z.
Thus the caster could locate the mind of someone 80 feet above then and
behind them, needless to say backstabbing someone who knows exactly
where you are is impossible.

However, this spell cannot locate object or things without minds, thus
it could locate anything that had less than zero intelligence. The
drawback to this spell is that it makes the caster susceptible to
mind-effecting spells i.e. save at -2.

The material component of this spell is a whole mind flayer brain.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearthia's Combat Spell (Abjuration, Alteration, Divination)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell prepares the fighter/mage for combat. It provides the
benefits of the following spells:

Strength	Detect Invisibility
Shield		Minor Globe of Invulnerability
Fly		Protection form Normal Missiles

It also provides 25% magic resistance and 4 temporary fighter levels.
(i.e. +4 to hit and 40 hit points). This spell can only be cast by
fighter/mages (or tri-classed with both classes).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearthia's Spell Vortex (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: One vortex around the caster
Saving Throw: None

Once this spell is cast a faintly visible 7-10 foot tall vortex appears
around the caster, centered on his feet. The vortex is a container for
spell energy. It can store up to 1 spell level per level of the
caster.  The caster may place any spell he wants into the vortex. He
also has a chance equal to his magic resistance of catching a spell
cast at him with the vortex.

After the spell's energy is stored in the vortex, the caster may use
the energy to fire other spells from the vortex. He may only fire
spells he has "taught" the vortex though (the ones he put into the
vortex himself).  Shooting a spell from the vortex may be accomplished
once a round, plus one may be fired at anyone who casts a spell at the
mage that round. The caster may do anything except spell casting and
still be able to fire all his spells each round.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pobithakor's Placer (Alteration, Divination)

Range: Special
Components: S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1/2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Pobithakor's tracer for not only does it allow
the two way scrying but the caster has the option of pulling the
scrying creature "through" the two way portal right to the casters
current location. The creature gets no saving throw and the process
occurs almost instantly. The caster, unless special measures are taken,
has no control over the creature once it arrives.

This was another spell used by the paranoid mage when he felt his
defenses being compromised.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prismatic Beam (Abjuration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7" long plane, 11/2" wide at end, 1/2" wide at base
Saving Throw: Special

Like Prismatic Spray but all 7 rays hit the same target. Great for
zapping dragons, demons etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Fire Giant Manifestation (Conjuration)

Range: 10" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 7 turns
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a golem-like creature which the mage may direct to
perform certain programmed actions. The creature is a temporary fire
golem with no true intelligence and to most appears as an undead fire
giant. The creature may be controlled up to a distance equal to the
spell range but if it passes outside of this range, or the spellcaster
is killed, the creature will explode in a 70' radius area doing damage
equal to its current hit points (save vs. breath weapon for half
damage). The creature created mimics most of the actions of a fire
giant, having AC 3, MV 12", HD 11 + 3, HP 58, AT 1, DM 5-30, SP:
Immune to fire, SZ: L (12'), Strength 22. The creature can fight with
its sword only and has no ability to hurl rocks as does a normal fire
giant. It can inflict structural damage points as a normal fire giant
on a round to round basis (Wood: 2, Soft Stone: 1, Hard Rock: 1/2).

The caster is able to direct the creature to perform 3 individual
actions plus 1 for every two levels of experience above 14th level.
Each change in action will cause the creature to hesitate for one round
before working to act out the next action. Actions can be classed as
"killing a group of orcs", "killing a group of men wearing the same
colours or armour", "tearing down a stone wall", "pulling up a tree",
etc. Once the final action is completed the fire giant crumbles into a
pool of hot sulfur, effectively making a circular area 30' in diameter
full of sulfuric acid (which will kill all vegetation in the area and
causing 1-3 HP of damage per round to any organic creature in the area.
Against mind affecting spells, the creature is considered to have an
intelligence and wisdom of 3 (saving at -3 vs. these attacks). If the
creature is charmed or controlled by a mind affecting spell the casters
concentration is totally disrupted causing the creature to dissipate
and any other spells the caster currently controls will become
dispelled unless the caster has no control over the spells in question
after casting them, and any spell the caster is currently casting will
be disrupted.

This spell requires only the slightest mental control of the caster to
operate, allowing him to cast other spells normally that do not require
his full concentration. Multiple castings of this spell will work, but
all of the detrimental effects are cumulative. The material component
of this spell is a small pouch (2" squared) of leather containing a
patch of fresh (not dried) fire giant hair mixed with ruby dust of no
less than 1,000 GP value. The fire giant hair may be kept fresh with a
Preserve spell or similar effect.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Temporal Demi-Plane (Conjuration, Evocation)

Range: 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell uses the magical forces of the astral or ethereal planes to
create a small demi-plane. This demi-plane is connected to the current
plane of the caster through a special (10' x 10') gateway which is
invisible to all creatures except the caster unless they are able to
use True Sight. When cast, this spell causes astral or ethereal stone
to form into a 10' cube. This cube houses the physical structure of the
demi-plane, but the interior is a distorted dimensional area with a
volume equal to 10 cubic feet of space per level of the spellcaster.
In its drab, gray interior, the demi-plane is governed by the physical
and magical laws of the plane in which it is created (astral or
ethereal), but does have a localised gravity which is under the control
of the caster (normally equal to that of the Prime Material plane but
it may be lowered all the way to 0 g at a rate of .1 g per round).
There is no need for air and nutritional needs since characters are
governed by the normal astral or ethereal laws. The mage may change the
interior form, but may not decrease or increase the volume of the
demi-plane. Volume form is changed in 10 foot cubic blocks, and it is
impossible to make any area smaller than 10 cubic feet, though, pits
and similar obstacles can be created. Also, the normal temperature in
the demi-plane is 68 degrees Fahrenheit and may not be changed.

A mage must touch someone for them to see and enter the gateway, but,
once inside, anyone may freely exit the demi-plane. If someone is able
to see the gateway through the use of True Sight, and he is a mage
familiar with the Wizard Lock or Temporal Demi-Plane spells, he may
attempt to enter the gateway by using his willpower to negate the need
for the casting mage's touch. In game terms this means a successful
percentile roll with a base 50% chance modified plus or minus 5% for
every difference in level from the caster in an upward or downward
progression, respectively. A mage seeing the gateway and meeting the
stated prerequisites will automatically know that this is possible.
Otherwise, only spells of a wish-like nature will be able to discern
the entrance, though creatures with senses that extend into the astral
or ethereal planes will be able to see the large block of stone that
makes up the external surface of the demi-plane area and psionic
characters may be able to use probability travel to gate into the
demi-plane if they are familiar with it.

The demi-plane does not allow access to the astral or ethereal planes
unless it is destroyed, or if the mage creates the demi-plane while on
one of these planes, in which case the entrance to the demi-plane is
actually entered on the plane in which it resides and not a connecting
outer or elemental plane. When the spell is initially memorised the
caster must determine whether he will cast the astral or ethereal
variant of this spell. It is impossible for both to be used in the same
area of effect (on the Prime Material plane) due to conjugations of
magic energies required in maintaining the spell.

The structure containing the demi-plane is able to withstand 3 HP of
structural damage (vs. hard stone) before it is disrupted. The ethereal
cyclone will inflict 1-100 HP of structural damage every time it passes
over the area of the demi-plane and the psychic winds of the astral
plane automatically inflict damage equal to one-half the current
structural hit points of the demi-plane's shell. The nature of the
demi-plane causes it to stay in one spot so it may be used as a
reference point if the spell duration is long enough (through the
possible use of a permanency-type spell). But, no matter what spells
are applied to the demi-plane, it will always disrupt when its
structural hit points are brought to 0 or less. The contents of the
demi-plane are then thrown into the plane of creation and all creatures
must save vs. spells at -6 or be knocked unconscious for a period of
time equal to one hour of time on the plane in question (not subjective
time). If cast on the ethereal plane the spell duration is extended by
a factor 10 and on the astral plane the duration is extended by a
factor 1000. The material component of this spell is a miniature
platinum ziggurat embedded with peridots and having a finished value of
at least 1000 GP. The ziggurat weighs 10 GP.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Dragon Bite (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 2 levels
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Sillvatar's Dragon Claw, except it conjures a
shadowy dragon head within spell range. The procedures for attacks are
as per that spell, except the victims who are hit receive bite damage,
instead of claw damage. For example, if this spell is cast using the
material component from a white dragon, the damage inflicted by each
successful bite is 2-16 points of damage. In addition, each attack
receives a +2 on all "to hit" rolls.

The caster may conduct 2 attacks using this spell, each of which must
occur in a separate round. The dragon head dissipates when both attacks
have been made, the duration expires, or the head is dispelled. The
head is not harmed by other attacks.

The material component for this spell is the teeth from any type of
dragon; these teeth are consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stash (Alteration)

Range: 300 yards
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 300 pounds per level
Saving Throw: None

Stores a large mass in hyperspace for an indefinite period of time
until a command word is spoken. The object(s) in hyperspace do not
experience passage of time so for example a small army with all its
weapons and equipment could be stashed in time of peace and recalled
when war started. A spellcaster can have only one Stash spell in effect
at the same time: if he wishes to stash anything, he will first have to
recall the items or persons previously Stashed.

Only objects and willing victims are affected by this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Wizard (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 50 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Within one round of casting this spell, the caster summons 1d2 wizards
to aid him. The summoned wizards' level will be equal to 3/4 the
caster's level, rounded down, up to a maximum of twentieth level. The
wizards will appear anywhere within the spell range as desired by the
caster, and will serve the caster as per monsters summoned via a
monster summoning spell. There is an 80% chance of summoning a mage,
and a 20% chance of summoning a specialist (determine school
randomly).  Equipment and abilities are determined randomly. The
material component for this spell is an ornately carved, gem-encrusted,
wooden staff (worth at least 100 GP), which is consumed when the spell
is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uldark's Radiant Bolt (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 100 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature per bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a small interdimensional connection opens
between the quasi-elemental plane of radiance and the caster's plane;
through this opening, a 1 foot diameter glowing sphere appears and
slowly hovers around the caster. This sphere contains all colours of
the spectrum; this sphere will last for 2 rounds per level of the
caster; if not used to its full potential at that time, the sphere
dissipates.

During any round which the sphere is in effect, the caster may
discharge a bolt of one colour of the spectrum; only one such attack
may be made in a single round, and the sphere may discharge only one
bolt per colour; once used, that colour disappears from the sphere.
When all colours have been discharged, or when the duration expires,
the sphere dissipates. Each bolt may affect one creature, and each
colour has a unique composition as follows:

colour	composition	item save vs
------	-----------	-------------
red	fire		magical	fire
orange	poison		n.a.
yellow	acid		acid
green	gas		n.a.
blue	lightning	lightning
indigo	cold		cold
violet	force		crushing blow

All the bolts do an identical amount of damage: 1d6 + 2 per level of
the caster.  A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage by
half. If this save fails, the victim's possessions must save vs. the
indicated composition (if applicable) or be destroyed.

There is a chance that an extraplanar creature may enter through the
opening whenever this spell is cast. The chance of this occurring is:
20% - 1% per level of the caster (to a minimum of 1%). Any creature
entering the caster's plane will normally be hostile to the caster.

The material component for this spell is a crystal or glass prism;
light is sent through the prism to create a spectrum when the spell is
cast. The prism is consumed with the casting of the spell.

Valcon's Spectral Army (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 200 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 turns
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Using this spell, the caster may create an army of semi-real humanoids;
any type of humanoid may be chosen, but all soldiers must be of the
same type.  Because the army is somewhat real, they may not be
disbelieved. The army is made up of one or more "units," each of which
is comprised of 10 infantry soldiers. The caster may create a number of
units according to the following table:

level	# units
-----	-------
14-15	2
16-17	3
18-19	4
20+	5

The army may appear anywhere within spell range as desired by the
caster. The army must not stray too far from the caster; they may move
up to a distance of 20 yards per level of the caster. This spell will
last until the caster wishes it to end, or until all units of the army
are destroyed; however, a single caster may not have more than two of
these spells in effect at any one time; any additional castings of the
spell will fizzle and be wasted.

Each unit always moves and attacks as a single entity; it will never
split up, or act independently, as each unit is a single component of
the illusion.  The unit will have an armour class equal to: 22 -
caster's level, and hit points equal to 2 times the caster's level
(i.e. a 16th level caster, may create 3 units, each having an AC of 6
and 32 hit points). All hits on the unit count against the units' hit
point total; an individual soldier may not be destroyed, even if all
hits are on a single target. Once the units' hit point total is
exceeded, all 10 soldiers in that unit are destroyed. Besides melee
attacks, the army may be dispelled, although only one unit may be
dispelled per dispel attempt.

Each unit will be equipped with armour appropriate to their AC, and
will be armed according to what material components are used; the
caster may provide one or more weapons for every unit he creates; the
units will then be armed with the corresponding weapon(s).  Any number
of weapons may be given to a single unit, and each unit may be equipped
differently from the rest; the only stipulation is that the caster must
have the appropriate number of the desired weapons available when the
spell is cast (in the case of missile weapons, the missiles themselves
need not be used as a component; the missile weapon suffices in this
case). Continuing the example of the 16th level caster, the caster may
elect to equip all 3 units with longswords only (at the cost of 3
longswords as a material component) or may wish to diversify by
equipping one with long bows and short swords, one with spears, and the
third with halberds; (at the cost of 1 each of a long bow, short sword,
spear, and halberd as a material component).

Since a unit always acts as a group, it may only make one or two
attacks per round, unless equipped with a weapon that normally allows
multiple attacks (i.e. a unit of long bow archers would receive 2 or 4
attacks per round). If the unit makes only one melee attack in a round,
it will inflict 1d8 points of damage if successful; if two melee
attacks are made, each will inflict 1d4 points of damage if a hit is
scored; the amount of damage does not depend on the type of weapon used
- all cause the same amount of damage.

Missile attacks cause 1d4 points of damage if the minimum number of
attacks are made, or 1d2 points of damage if the maximum number of
attacks are conducted (i.e. a unit using long bows would do 1d4 points
of damage per hit if two attacks are made, or 1d2 points of damage per
hit if making 4 attacks).

Hurled weapons are not allowed by this spell. Under no circumstances
may these illusionary armies use any special attack or defense forms
normally employed by their race (i.e. an illusionary army of trolls
will not regenerate lost hit points). Strength, dexterity, and similar
bonuses also do not apply.

In addition to the weapons required for material components, the caster
must also have a suit of armour (and a shield, if desired) that
comprise the appropriate armour class for the units. One suit (and
shield, if used) is sufficient for all units created by this spell. All
material components are consumed when the spell ends.

Wolldin's Fearstalker (Illusion/Phantasm)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates an illusionary creature in the mind of its victim
much the same as a Phantasmal Killer spell. The "fearstalker" appears
as a shadowy creature of a vaguely humanoid shape (only the victim and
the caster can see the creature). Once cast, the fearstalker will
tirelessly pursue its target; if the victim does not succeed in making
a disbelieve check (this intent must be specifically stated) it will be
attacked by the fearstalker.

The fearstalker has a movement rate of 24, has HD equal to half the
caster's level (rounded down), has 2 attacks (2-12/2-12), and can be
hit only by +1 or better weapons. It is immune to charms and other
mind-affecting spells, but is susceptible to most other spells and
magic attacks.

Once the battle has been joined, nothing short of the death of one of
the combatants will end it. Rendering the victim unconscious will not
help, as the fearstalker will enter the target's dreams and the battle
will continue normally. If the caster of the spell is slain or rendered
unconscious, the current battle will continue normally, but the
fearstalker will not be able to return at a later time (see below).

If the victim of this spell is reduced to 0 hit points by the
fearstalker, he must make a systems shock roll; if this roll fails, the
victim dies and the spell ends; if it succeeds, the target only
believes he has died and falls into a coma for 2-24 hours. Only a Heal
spell or a Wish will rouse the victim from this coma. If the target
reduces the fearstalker to 0 hit points, it will vanish instantly.
However, in this case, the fearstalker is not actually destroyed; it
will reappear in 4-24 hours (at full strength) to again attack its
victim (the fearstalker will not be able to return if the caster has
been slain, or if he was unconscious at the time of the fearstalker's
defeat in the previous battle).

The only way to permanently end this spell (short of the victim's
death) is to make a successful disbelieve check. The victim is allowed
one such roll each time the fearstalker returns after being defeated,
as well as when the spell is first cast. This disbelieve check has the
same modifiers applied to it as for the Phantasmal Killer spell.
However, the wearer of a Helm of Telepathy may not turn the fearstalker
upon the caster. If the victim is asleep or otherwise unconscious when
the fearstalker returns, the battle will take place in the target's
dreams, and the disbelieve check is made with a -2 penalty.

Zandare's Twist (Alteration, Enchantment)

Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

By means of this spell the caster changes the target creature,
effectively, inside out. The organs are outside the body and the skin
is inside. GM's insert your own really graphic descriptions here... The
spell caster must have a small leather pouch for the casting.  At the
end of the seven segments the caster thrusts his hand into the bag and
violently pulls the bag inside out.  Now the target is either painfully
turned inside out, or the caster looks like a total fool.  The spells
affects one medium size creature or two small creatures.  Large
creatures receive a +3 to their save.

Note that clothing, armour, etc. are in the inside also.

Caligula's Vitality Drain (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This terrible spell allows the caster to drain the youth from a victim,
revitalising himself, at the expense of aging the victim. Hardly a
spell used by good aligned mages.

The caster first prepares the spell, by casting the eight phase portion
of it. He then has his level in rounds to make contact with the victim,
and begin draining. To drain the youth of the victim, the caster must
be in continuous contact with the flesh of the victim during the
draining process.  The act of being drained is extremely painful to the
victim, and is sufficient to awaken sleeping victims, and allow charmed
victims a new saving throw. Even if the victim is conscious, however,
the draining will continue. The victim must break flesh contact with
the mage to break the spell.

The caster is able to drain a decade for every four levels he
possesses, i.e. 20 years at fifth, 30 at ninth, 40 at 13th, etc.  Each
year takes a segment to drain, a decade drained per round. If the spell
is broken during casting, the caster will still have drained a number
of years dependent on time of casting (e.g. contact broken after 2
rounds, 20 years drained). Due to the imperfect nature of the spell,
however, the caster only reduces in age by a year for every three
drained from the victim.

Both caster and victim will be affected by the change in age. The
victim will only suffer the disadvantages of aging (STR and CON loss),
whereas the caster will only experience the benefits (STR and CON
gain). After the spell, the victim will have visibly aged, with greying
hair, and lined, shaggy skin.  The caster will appear envigourated,
with grey disappearing from his hair, and the obvious return of muscle
tone.  The victim must save vs. paralyse, or pass out for 1d4 turns, if
he is drained more than 20 years. The caster will experience a
temporary d4 increase in STR (not including that gained from becoming
younger), which will fade by 1 point a turn. The caster will also feel
as if inebriated, an affect which persists for d6 rounds.

This spell is only effective on humans. Long lived races, such as elves
and dwarves, as well as humanoid races, are immune from the spell, and
the caster must save vs. paralysation, or be knocked unconscious if
attempting to drain a member of these races.

Finally, there is no known cure for this spell, save Wish. The material
component of this spell is a scrap of flesh from a vampire, which must
be consumed by the caster.

Fellstar's Flame Jet (Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 5 levels (4 rounds maximum)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a jet of flames shoots forth from the caster's
hand; this jet is 5' wide and has a length of up to 10 yards per level
of the caster (the caster may vary the length from 1 foot up to the
maximum range).  The jet travels in a straight line and is blocked by
normal obstacles (i.e.  stone, metal, etc.). If the jet is blocked, it
will it will not rebound, but may flow around the barrier if it is
small enough (less than 5 feet across).

Anyone struck by the jet suffers 1d10 points of damage per two levels
of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d10). A successful save vs. spell
reduces the damage by one half. If this save fails, all possessions
must save vs. magical fire or be consumed.

The flames from this spell will melt ice and ignite wood on contact;
they are able to melt a hole in a all of Ice in a single round (though
they will not destroy it), and can bring down a Wall of Fog instantly;
other wall spells are not affected by this spell.

The jet will remain in effect for one round for every 5 levels of the
caster, up to a maximum of 4 rounds. A single creature must be chosen
as the target for the jet (but others may be struck if they are in the
path of the flames) and a new target may be selected each round the
spell is in effect.

If the caster chooses, two jets (one from each hand) may be employed
instead of one; if this is the case, range and damage are halved (in
some cases, one jet will do one more die of damage than the other). A
separate target may be chosen for each of these jets each round they
are in effect.

At the beginning of each round the spell is in effect, the caster may
split a single jet in two, or may combine two jets into a single one.

The material components for this spell are a powdered ruby and a
powdered fire opal which must be worth a least 500 GP together. The
powdered gems are mixed together in the hand(s) of the caster at the
time of the casting; all material components are consumed with the
casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamye's Spell Reversal (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level, minus 10 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Special

This spell affects the saving throws vs. spell of the subject in much
the same way that the fifth level spell Jamye's Armour Reversal (q.v.)
affects attack rolls, i.e. saving throw results that would normally
indicate success will fail, and results that would normally fail will
succeed.  For example, a 19th-level mage normally needs a 6 or greater
to save vs. a spell.  If he is affected by a Spell Reversal spell, he
will need a 5 or less (i.e. a failure under normal circumstances) to
save vs. a spell.  Protection devices, Wisdom bonuses, etc. all work to
the benefit of the subject, i.e. if the above mage had a Ring of
Protection +3 and a Wisdom of 16 (+2 magical defense), he would need an
8 or less to save vs. most spells (5 normally, +3 for the Ring) and a
10 or less to save vs. spells that would give him his Wisdom bonus.
Likewise, penalties to saving throws still work to the detriment of the
subject.  If the subject is willing, there is no saving throw;
otherwise, a normal save vs. spell (obviously, this is made before the
spell takes effect) will negate it.

There are certain special cases that apply to this spell.  It is not
affected by Spell Turning.  The only thing that can dispel it is
another Spell Reversal cast at the subject, who must make a save while
under the influence of the original Spell Reversal.  If the subject is
under the influence of another spell that grants invulnerability to
certain spells (Shield vs. Magic Missile, for instance, or any type of
Globe of Invulnerability, but *not* Anti-Magic Shell), the subject
takes full, maximum damage from that spell with no saving throw.  For
instance, a mage has both Shield and Spell Reversal cast upon him.  If
he is targeted for Magic Missiles during the time both spells are
functioning, he will take 5 points of damage - the maximum possible -
from *each* Missile that hits him.

The material components for this spell are a piece of amber worth no
less than 300 GP, and a doughnut made less than 24 hours previously.

Life Leech (Necromancy) Reversible

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell allows the death master to steal 2d6 years from a victim and
add them to his own life. The victim must be human and of a level equal
to or greater than that of the caster. If the victim is of lower level,
the number of years transferred is multiplied by the victim's level and
divided by the necromancer's. Since the victim must be in the center of
a pentagram at the completion of the casting, it is useful to have him
held or immobilised in some way. The reverse spell works in the same
fashion, except that the caster ages 2d6 years while the recipient
becomes younger, and the recipient must be willing. In either case, the
material components are a black candle, a white candle, a drop of blood
from both parties, and a specially prepared glass screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-Range Carrier (Alteration)

Range: 100 miles per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Long-Range Carrier is like the 5-Mile Carrier but the range is 100
miles per level of caster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Sending (Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: One creature per 2 levels
Saving Throw: Negates

The Sending spell was created by Lorth the Traveller as a more
versatile form of the Teleport spell. When the spell is cast, one
creature for every two levels of the mage (rounded down) is Sent to a
place defined by the caster as for a Teleport spell (the caster must
have a mental image of the place). The creatures must be touching the
mage, but "chains" are possible. The mage does not have to accompany
them, but he may if he so desires. There is no chance of error for
this spell.

If any of the creatures "sent" is harmed within 5 minutes of arrival,
all of them will be bounced back to the place from which they were Sent
(whether they want to go or not). Any damage incurred during those five
minutes, to themselves or their equipment, is erased. Note that this
does not allow the spell to be used as a quick and easy messenger
spell; anything dropped during the five minute grace period is returned
with its owner. This can be used as a fail-safe teleport. After the
five minute period elapses, the spell expires and the "protected"
individuals are on their own. The Sending will not work across planar
boundaries. Unwilling creatures receive a saving throw vs. magic to
resist this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Globe of Invulnerability (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1" diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the same as the fourth level Minor Globe of
Invulnerability (q.v.), except with regards to casting time. This spell
prevents the function of first to fifth level spells passing through
and affecting the mage within the sphere, while allowing the mage to
cast spells through it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Halflife (Necromancy)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When this spell is cast, a crackling, black bolt shoots from the
caster's palm towards its victim. The caster must make a successful "to
hit" roll (with a +2 bonus) in order to hit the target; if this roll
misses, use the grenade scatter diagram to determine if anyone else is
hit by the bolt. If anyone is in the area of the miss, a normal "to
hit" roll (with no bonus) is used to determine if the stray bolt hits
anyone.

Anyone who is hit by the bolt must make a saving throw vs. spell; if
this roll is successful, the spell has no effect and the bolt
dissipates. If the save fails, the victim immediately loses half of his
current hit points (round fractions down), and is rendered unconscious
by the shock. These lost hit points may be regained through normal
means.

The material component for this spell is an onyx gem worth at least 500
GP. The gem is held in the hand of the caster, and is consumed when
the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Major Backlash (Abjuration, Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to Mystyk's Improved Backlash except for the
following: when the caster is hit in melee, any damage suffered is
halved; in addition, if the caster makes a successful save vs. rods,
the attack inflicts no damage at all. Also, the energy bursts inflict
10d6 points of damage on any attacker; a successful save vs. spell
reduces this damage by half.

The material component for this spell is the same as that for Mystyk's
Backlash except the gem must be worth at least 800 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Plane Survival (Abjuration, Alteration)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One creature per 5 levels
Saving Throw: None

This spell provides the caster with a means of surviving on a hostile
plane of existence. In order for this spell to work, the wizard must
have access to a library or other source of information on the plane in
question. This information must then be studied for an extended length
of time; this period is equal to: 24 weeks - 1 week per level of the
caster (to a minimum of one week). After this time has passed, the
wizard is ready to cast the spell.

Each time this spell is cast for use on a new plane, the normal study
time is required. If cast for use on a previously studied plane, and
less than a week has passed since the last casting with respect to that
plane, no additional studying is necessary as the information is still
fresh in the wizard's mind; however, if more than a week has elapsed
since the previous casting, a day of "brushing up" is required.

If the wizard is a sage with expertise in the plane in question, normal
research times are required (see section on sages in the DMG) the first
time this spell is cast for use on that plane. If cast again within two
weeks, no additional time for studying is needed; if cast more than two
weeks later, only 12 hours of brushing up is necessary. These times
also apply if the wizard is obtaining this information from another
sage.

Using the information gained from his studies, the caster prepares the
Plane Survival spell. After one hour has passed, the spell is complete;
at this time, the DM (secretly) rolls percentile dice; a result of 5 or
lower indicates the wizard has used erroneous information in the
casting of the spell which will reduce the protection afforded by the
spell, and may even cause it to fail altogether (the exact effects
depend on the source of information and other factors, and it is left
to the DM to decide the exact results).  If some or all of the planar
information was obtained by a sage who misdirected the wizard, the
percentile roll has a -25% penalty applied to it. Even if correct
information is obtained from a sage, a -5% penalty applies, since the
wizard is using secondhand information. In any case, if the roll
results in a 1, the spell fails altogether (although the caster will
not know this until attempting to make use of the spell's protection).

If the spell was successfully cast, it will grant the caster (along
with others, if the caster's level is high enough) protection from the
hostile environment of the studied plane of existence. The recipients
may move about in the plane as if they were in the prime material
plane; conditions that would make it hazardous or impossible to exist
in the plane are negated by this spell. Spells have a chance of having
normal affects while under the influence of the Plane Survival spell:
when a spell is cast, if the caster makes a successful save vs.
paralysation, his spell will have normal affects (as if it were cast on
the prime material plane) instead of the affects it usually has on that
plane.

If the recipients are still on the plane when this spell expires,
normal characteristics for that plane go into effect immediately. Note
that this spell provides no way of moving from one plane to another; it
only provides a means of survival once a plane is reached. The caster
may have more than one of these spells in affect at a time, as long as
the appropriate amount of time has been spent studying each plane.

The material components for this spell are a diamond worth at least
1000 GP and a specimen of a substance related to the plane in
question (i.e some fire for the plane of fire, darkness for the
negative material plane, etc.).  Alternately, something symbolising the
plane may be used (i.e. a balance for the plane of concordant
opposition). All material components are consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Link (Necromancy)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 10
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: Negates

This spell creates a link between the caster and the victim through
which magical energy can flow. Thus the wizard can cast spells centered
on the recipient, as if he were a projected image. Also, the wizard can
route malevolent spell side-effects, such as magical aging, to the
victim. The material components of the spell are a chip of jet, an
herbal tea of spearmint and devil's dung, and a wooden disc. The
recipient must be an intelligent, living native of the wizard's home
plane.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sarius' Ethereal Gateway (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 2" per level
Components: V, S
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a mage to create a 10' x 10' x 1" invisible magical
gateway which will provide access to the ethereal plane of existence,
or alternatively, provide a gateway from the ethereal plane to a
connecting plane of existence. The duration of this gateway is a base
24 hours. It must be cast in an area of gaseous or waterous makeup
(i.e., not in the earth or in solid rock), although, it may be cast so
as to lay on the floor (giving a chance of creatures falling into it)
or against a wall or portal. For every two levels above 16th a mage
gains the ability to create an additional 10' x 10' area (two if a
Conjurer specialist) which must either be used to increase the surface
area of the gateway or increase the power of the original 10' x 10'
area by infusing the two gateways together. The effects of increasing
the power level of a gateway are listed in the table below.

If a gateway is larger than 10' x 10' then all of its surface area
blocks must be increased to the same level of power to allow the
gateway the next higher power rating. For example, a 26th level mage
creates a gateway with dimensions of 30' x 10' and has three slots
left, so he will be able to double the surface area power rating to 2
if he so chooses. But, if he were to use one of the remaining slots to
make an add an additional 10' x 10' block to the surface are he would
have no chance of raising the power rating of the gateway to 2. Note
that if a gateway is too small for a creature to fit through it will
not be able to totally go through the portal, though, it will be able
to poke part of its body through and exist simultaneously on both
planes.

Power
Rating	Duration	Comments (Cumulative Effects)
------	-----------	-----------------------------------
1	1 day		Visible on the exit side
2	10 days		Invisible on exit side
3	100 days	Allows magic items to keep powers *
4	1,000 days	10% more resistant to Dispel Magic
5	10,000 days	20% more resistant to Dispel Magic
6	Permanent	30% more resistant to Dispel Magic
7	Permanent	40% more resistant to Dispel Magic
8	Permanent	(each power slot adds another 10%)

* Usually magical swords and similar items lose a plus for plane
crossing.

Each additional power slot beyond a rating of 3 adds a 10% extra
percentage that this spell will resist a Dispel Magic. For game
purposes, this is added onto the dispeller's percentage as a penalty.

Casting time is one turn for the initial gateway area and is doubled
every time another 10' x 10' block is added onto the area (i.e., 2
turns for 2 10' x 10' blocks or slots, 4 turns for 3 10' x 10' blocks
or slots, 8 turns for 4 10' x 10' blocks or slots, etc.). Therefore,
casting a gateway that uses 6 slots would take a total of 32 turns. If
the casting is interrupted after any slots have been created only
further creation of gateway surface areas or power slots is disrupted.

For every 6 turns the caster spends casting this spell the mage's
constitution score is reduced by one point. If the mage's constitution
reaches 0 he becomes unconscious and only a week of complete bed rest
will allow him to start regaining lost constitution. Otherwise, these
points are replaced at a rate of 1 point for every two days of complete
bed rest. The point is not taken unless a full 6 turns of casting has
expired. A Heal spell will negate the unconsciousness and raise the
mage's constitution to 1 point. A Restoration will totally negate the
effects of any lost constitution.

Gateways, once created, may not be altered by further castings of this
spell on the same area of effect. Only a successful Dispel Magic is
capable of destroying a gateway, although higher level power ratings
can make a gateway resistant to this spell. Power rating 1 gateways are
visible to creatures on the exit side of the gateway (usually the
ethereal plane) and may attract wandering monsters, though they will
most likely not be able to pass through. Anyone may pass through the
portal on the invisible entrance side, but only the mage may freely
take creatures back through the exit side by touching them as they pass
through. The mage may create magical amulets (base 500 GP value) which
will allow any creature to freely use gateways cast by him as though he
were touching them. On the ethereal plane, the caster and anyone
possessing an amulet will be able to find any portal of the caster in
5-50 hours.

Any mage familiar with this spell (i.e., either possessing the spell as
a castable spell in his spellbook, or having used a Write spell to put
the spell in his spellbook) is capable of trying to force their way
through the exit side back to the entrance side by force of will. There
is a base chance of 50% modified by plus or minus 5% for every point of
difference between the mage's current level and the level of the caster
at the time of casting, though Conjuration specialists have a base 70%
chance. There are no material components to the spell, and the magical
amulets may be created at any time the mage wishes, whether before or
after the casting of this spell. This spell will not work with the 8th
level Permanency spell.

The source of this spell is Sarius Mendlekine.

Sheath (Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: One object
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it empowers strong magics between a creature
and an item. What the effect of this spell is to allow a creature to
store a favoured item into an extra-dimensional space and bring it
forth at will.

The object, while it is in it's space, is completely non-detectable,
by any means, except by use of a wish. It will also be perfectly safe
in the space where it is held.

During the casting of the spell, two command words and a physical
gesture must be specified. The command words are those to make leave
and enter the "storage" space. The gesture is used with the command to
bring the object back into the owners possession. For example, a
creature would make a "sword holding gesture while using the proper
command to retrieve his sword.

The material components for this spell is a 5000 GP of blue sapphire
dust which is sprinkled on a phase spider web. The web is then wrapped
around the object and the enchantments are completed.

This is a great way to carry around important equipment. Magic Users
are prone to cast this upon their spell books to always keep them
handy.

Sillvatar's Dragon Armour (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster will be covered by a semi-real
coating of dragon scales. The type of dragon that provided the material
component determines the protection afforded by this spell: the armour
class of the caster is equal to the appropriate dragon's armour class
at age category 1-6. For example, if the material component was
obtained from a green dragon, and a 6 is rolled for the age category,
the caster would have armour class -2 for the duration of this spell.

The material component for this spell is a small pouch of scales from
any type of dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stargate (Alteration)

Range: Infinite
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 2 gates
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a gate between the caster's current location and any
location which the caster has been before. The gate can be freely
crossed in either direction and will last one hour per level of caster.
Range is not an issue (hence the name of the spell). Anyone can cross
the Stargate, as long as it is in existence.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summon Wraiths (Conjuration/Summoning, Necromancy)

Range: 10 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round + 1 round per level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 10 foot high cube
Saving Throw: None

This spell is identical to the fifth-level spell Summon Shadow, except
that it conjures up one wraith for every three levels the death master
has attained. These monsters are under the control of the wizard until
they are slain or the spell expires.

If the wraiths are turned, they continue to serve in any capacity which
does not require them to confront the cleric who resisted them.

The material component of this spell is a piece of black jet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Block (Abjuration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 1000 cubic feet per level
Saving Throw: Special

This spell prevents teleportation into or out of the region specified
by the caster, which may be of any shape and any size, up to 1000 cubic
feet per level of the abjurer. No character can enter or leave the
region by means of dimension door, teleport, or other-planar travel.
Teleportation within the region is not restricted, and teleport without
error has a chance of success equal to 1% per level of the caster,
though it has the same chance of failure as a regular teleport
attempted under normal conditions. A full wish will also provide
transportation across the boundary, as of course will walking, riding,
and flying.

Any attempt to teleport or dimension door across the block will
automatically fail; all memory of the spell will be lost; and the
caster must make a system shock check or be killed by the shock of the
rebound. Attempts at transplanar travel will also fail, but not in so
dramatic a fashion. The material component is a glass globe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teleport Warp (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 10-yard per level radius globe
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all creatures teleporting into or out of the area of
effect to arrive in a prepared area.  The area which the caster wishes
people to appear in must also be in the area of effect.

The space the caster wishes incoming teleporters to arrive at must be
open area, free from objects.  It can be in the air however, causing
incomers to fall.  Should a person teleporting into an area effected by
this spell be larger than the area he would be sent to, then he is
effectively blocked and would not be able to teleport at all to the
area.

Example:  Archmage Istle casts Teleport Warp on his tower.  He wishes
all people who unexpectedly arrive to be placed in his dungeon cell
which is 10' x 10' x 10'.  The cell is also in the area of effect, at
the bottom of his tower, which totally is under the spell.  Thus a
person who teleports to his tower will arrive in a dungeon cell instead
of the wizards guest chambers.  If Golstein the Chaotic decides to send
his 18 foot tall iron golem over to Istle's bed chamber, he will find
the golem still there, unmoved.

All forms of teleport magic are affected, thus Dimension door, Pattern
teleports and the like also would be warped.  This is a great spell for
the mage wishing to "block" an area for outside aid coming in short of
all out planar travel.

Material component is a lodestone which must be placed in the location
the caster wishes teleporters to arrive.  It is consumed upon casting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vandergast's Vacuous Void (Alteration)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 5' per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a momentary vacuum inside the area of effect. Anyone
caught inside this area must save vs. spell to avoid the crushing
effects of the vacuum. If the save fails, the victim suffers 8d8 points
of crushing damage; all possessions must save vs. crushing blow at -4
or be destroyed. Anyone who dies outright from this spell has more than
likely (65%) been torn ass-under from the pressure differential. Note
that this may make regeneration difficult, if not impossible. If the
save is successful, the target suffers 4d8 points of damage, and
possessions are not affected.

The material components for this spell is an empty vial which is
unstoppered and broken at the time of the casting.

Bone Shatter (Evocation)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per 5 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Special

This is a more powerful version of the 5th level spell Bone Splinter.
It is identical to that spell except that is has a +3 "to hit" bonus
and causes a serious compound fracture when a hit is scored in melee,
with the following results:

	  to hit
location  modifier	effects
--------  --------	------------------------------------------------
head		-8	major skull fracture:
			save vs. spell or die; else suffer 4d8 points
			of damage (no save for 1/2).
arm *		-4	major broken arm:
			arm is totally useless; it cannot be used to
			attack or defend with.
leg *		-4	major broken leg:
			leg is totally useless; movement is 1/2
			normal.
ribs		-4	broken rib:
			loss of 1d6 CON points and 2d8 points of damage
			(no save).
spine @		-8	severed vertebrae:
			save vs. spell or die; else paralysed until
			healed/cured.
pelvis		-4	major hip fracture:
			-6 to DEX when using legs; movement rate is at
			1/4 normal; suffer 3d8 points of damage (no
			save).

* if attacking from the side, only the nearest appendage may be
targeted.
@ the spine may only be targeted if attacking from the rear.

A cure critical wounds spell is required to heal one of these effects
(except for paralysis, which must be cured by normal means) as long as
the victim is still alive, and a heal spell will fully restore a living
victim to full health.

The material components for this spell are an intact bone of at least a
foot in length, and a large metal hammer which are consumed when the
spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coradon's Conflagration (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 150 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell causes a fiery explosion similar to that of a Fireball, but
with a smaller radius (initially a 20' radius sphere). However, the
flames caused by this spell will continue to burn for 4 rounds (the
initial round, plus 3 additional rounds). The damage inflicted on
victims inside the area of effect, the bonus to the victim's saving
throw, and the radius of the flames vary according to how long the
flames have been burning, as follows:

round	damage	radius	save bonus
-----	------	------	----------
1	8d8	20'	0	
2	4d8	15'	+1	
3	2d8	10'	+2	
4	1d8	5'	+3	

Damage suffered is cumulative from one round to the next, but the save
bonus is not. Anyone who makes a successful save takes only half damage
that round, and automatically saves on any subsequent rounds; those who
fail their saves suffer full damage, and must have all their
possessions save vs. magical fire to avoid destruction. If anyone
leaves the area of effect and returns later, a new save must be made,
even if the previous one was successful.

The conflagration may, or may not conform to a confined space, at the
caster's discretion. Apart from the changes mentioned above, the
conflagration otherwise acts like a Fireball.

The material components for this spell are the heart of a red dragon,
and a powdered diamond worth at least 600 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Damians Mindswap (Enchantment/Charm)

Range: 7"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates

When this powerful enchantment is cast, the spell user attempts to rip
the target creatures soul from its body and temporarily place it in a
gem of not less than 15000 GP. At the same time the casters soul is
eased from his body and also travels through the gem. When, and if,
both souls are in the gem, they both proceed to the opposed bodies from
which they came. You'll note that this has two very noticeable
effects:

1) the caster and victim have essentially swapped minds (or bodies,
whichever you prefer), this has the effect that the caster now takes on
the physical attributes of that body (i.e. STR, CON, DEX and COM). The
caster still retains his own mental capacities and previous knowledge
(i.e. INT, WIS, CHR, hit points and level).

2) If the caster or victim can kill their old body (i.e. their swapped
body) then the others soul goes to its respective plane. Thus, after
completion of the spell, if the caster kills his old body then he can
never be displaced from his new, for in all intents and purposes it is
his body now. If neither is killed and at some later point in time a
cleric casts an exorcise spell at either body (both have to be within
7" of each other though) the caster of the original Mindswap must save
vs. death or return to his old body.

If the save vs. this spell is made it indicates that this persons body
will never accept the casters soul and need never fear this spell from
the same caster again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demonic Immunity (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Requires a demon's amulet of at least a type one demon, which is slowly
consumed and will be destroyed when the spell ends. Renders you
invulnerable to all demonic powers. Does nothing for physical attacks.
You cannot be telekinesed, you cannot be charmed by a demon, their
unholy words don't affect you, etc. No demonic powers can harm you.

The tougher the demon's amulet, the longer the spell lasts. The
duration can be split between people.

Type 1 demon: lasts 4 rounds. That's one round for 4 people, etc.
Type 2 demon: lasts 6 rounds.
Type 3 demon: lasts 8 rounds.
Type 4 demon: lasts 12 rounds.
Type 5 demon: lasts 20 rounds.
Type 6 demon: lasts 50 rounds.
Any "named" demon: lasts 100 rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ding Shu's Draconian Holocaust (Invocation, Evocation)

Range: 20" + 1" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1/5" per level by 1" per level swath
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell causes to what appears to be a huge Celestial Dragon to
appear in the air and swoop down spewing forth its fiery breath.

The spell affects an area of 2 feet wide by 10 feet long per level of
the caster. All creatures in the area of effect take 1D10 + 2 points of
damage from the fire.

This spell does structural damage to all constructions in the area of
effect. The damage is 3/2/1/.5 points to wood/earth/soft stone/hard
stone per level of the caster.

The material component of this spell is the scale from a fire breathing
dragon and a potion of firewater.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ding Shu's Marvelous Chopsticks (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 12"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 12" radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

This spell brings into existence a pair of huge chopsticks, 30 feet
long, which attacks all creatures as if they were AC 10 (modified by
dexterity). These giant chopsticks attack with the casters THAC0.

Victims weighing more than 5 tons are immobilised by the chopsticks,
while those of lesser weight will be picked up, and may be deposited,
within the same round, at any point in the spell's range. Those who
successfully roll to bend bars manage to free themselves, but they may
suffer falling damage as a result.

Most probably, the caster will choose to deposit the victims into a
gargantuan mouth which appears above his head. This mouth can hold 2
size L, 4 size M, or 8 of size S creatures at one time.

Each round, the mouth "chews" its contents for 10D10 damage each.  When
a creature trapped inside the mouth is reduced to below 0 hit points,
the creature is "swallowed" into the astral plane, and more room
becomes available for creatures to be dropped into the mouth.

Normally, persons reduced to such a hit point score would die in a
matter of minutes, but in the timelessness of the astral plane, they
may remain unconscious but barely alive for thousands of years,
provided they had more than -10 hit points when they entered the
plane.  This of course is only valid in campaigns which use the
optional rule concerning hovering at death's door.

If the creature caught by the chopsticks weighs more than 5 tons, then
the mouth will move toward the trapped creature and start biting it
into little pieces until it is all gone.

The spell requires minimal concentration and direction once it has been
cast. This allows the caster to cast other spells, and maintain
concentration on them instead.

If the caster is killed before the end of the spell's duration, the
mouth and chopsticks will remain, with the chopsticks capturing
creatures that were enemies of the caster and depositing them in the
mouth when space allows.

Naturally, the material component of this spell is a pair of
chopsticks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eldarr's Major Spell Conversion (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 hour per level
Casting Time: 3 turns
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the two previous spell conversion spells,
except it may convert any spell of level 9 or less to any known spell
of 8th level or lower.

The material components for this spell are as per those for Improved
Spell Conversion, except the gem must be worth at least 800 GP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expanded Awareness (Alteration, Divination) Reversible

Range: 1/2" per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 turn per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell, when used, gives the caster a great deal of information
about the immediate area. The caster receives the effects of the
following spells or spell like powers:

Detect Phase		Detect Secret Doors
Detect Magic		Detect Charms and Curses
Detect Illusion		Detect Poison
Detect Invisibility	Detect Enemies
Detect Evil or Good	Detect Traps
Detect Psionics		Detect Lie

The spell remains constantly in effect and the caster receives all the
information at once. There is no problem with assimilating the data.
The range of detection for this spell is 1/2" per level of the caster.

With the appropriate spell reversals, the caster using this spell could
become blind to some or all of the things that the spell detects for as
long as the spell would normally last. For example, the reversal of
know alignment cast upon the caster will cause him to be unable to
detect evil or good. In some instances, it will become obvious to the
caster that some of the detections are lost.

The caster does not have to concentrate to use this spell, the
information arrives immediately and the caster knows instantly. The
caster can cast other spells while this spell is in effect.

The reverse of this spell causes one creature to be unable to detect,
by any means, any of the above things for the magic of the spell will
render all attempts ineffective. There is no save versus this effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fellstar's Flame Sheet (Evocation)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

This is an improved version of Fellstar's Flame Arc; it is identical to
that spell, with the following exceptions:

The flames fall to the ground from the height at which they were cast,
so in effect, anyone at the initial height or below is affected by the
flames.  In addition, if these flames are blocked by an obstacle, they
will flow around the barrier and will rejoin at a distance equal to the
width the obstacle; therefore, if the flames are blocked by a 2 foot
wide boulder, they will rejoin 2 feet behind the rock. This applies in
both the horizontal and vertical dimensions.

The flames from this spell will continue to burn for one round after
the spell is cast; anyone hit by the flames on the first round suffers
10d10 points of damage, and those hit on the second round suffer 5d10
points of damage. On either round, a successful save vs. spell reduces
the damage by half (saves for the second round are at +2); if this save
fails, all possessions must save vs.  magical fire or be destroyed.
Note that damage is cumulative if caught in the flames on both rounds
the spell is in effect.

The material components for this spell are as per those for the Flame
Arc spell, with the addition of one or more gems worth at least 500
GP. The gems and the volcanic rock are consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fenzill's Phantasmal Fingers (Necromancy)

Range: 40 yards + 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: None

This spell is an enhanced version of the second level spell spectral
hand; it differs from that spell in the following ways: it can be used
to deliver a touch spell of any level and it gives a +3 to the attack
roll. It has an AC of -4, but it cannot be destroyed by any attack (it
may only be dispelled). Instead, any hit on the hand inflicts full
damage on the caster (although a successful save vs. spell reduces this
damage by half). The caster may end the spell with a single word.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Genocide (Evocation, Necromancy)

Range: 5 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 20-foot radius sphere
Saving Throw: Special

This spell allows the caster to kill one or more creatures of the same
species: the caster chooses a creature as the initial target for the
spell, and after the incantations are complete, a black bolt shoots
forth from the caster's finger towards the chosen target.  If this
creature makes its saving throw vs. spell at -2 (or if it has 15 or
more HD) there is no effect and the spell terminates.

If the save of the initial target fails, the creature dies, and the
spell continues as follows:  if there are no more creatures of the same
species within the area of effect, the spell ends at this point.
Otherwise, the bolt will continue jumping to other targets. The bolt
jumps randomly from one target to the next; range is not a
consideration - as long as the target is in the area of effect, and it
is of the appropriate race, it may be hit by the bolt. Each creature
that is hit with the bolt must make a successful saving throw vs. spell
(with no modifiers) or die.

This spell will affect a number of hit dice equal to: 10 HD + 1 HD per
level of the caster (the number of creatures is not a factor). The
spell will terminate when one or more of the following occurs: the HD
limit is exceeded, there are no more potential targets in the area of
effect, or the bolt strikes a target with more than 15 HD (such a
creature is unaffected by this spell).  Each target hit with the bolt
counts towards the HD limit, whether its saving throw was successful or
not.

The bolt will never jump to a creature of a different species, or to
one that has already been hit (whether living or dead). Any creature
with more HD than the original target will not be affected by the bolt,
but its number of HD is still counted towards the HD limit of the
spell. If a target's HD would exceed the limit of the spell, it is not
affected (and the spell terminates).

The bolt will never jump back to the caster; in addition, the caster
may choose individuals to be unaffected by the spell simply by naming
them as part of the incantations (usually used to avoid killing friends
or allies).

Note that some races are closely related, but are not considered
identical species for purposes of this spell (i.e. goblinkind).
"Half-breeds" will be affected by this spell if either of their
parent-race is targeted, as well as when the cross-breed is
specifically targeted. However, if a parent-race is named as the
target, a half-breed of that race earns a +2 to its save. For example,
a half-elf is affected normally if half-elves are named as the target
of this spell. They would also be affected if either humans or elves
were targeted, although they would gain a +2 to their saves in the
latter two cases.

After this spell is cast, the wizard must make a successful system
shock roll or fall unconscious for 1d10 rounds. Note that the DM may
wish to inflict other penalties on the caster due to loss of blood (see
material components below), especially if the spell is cast more than
once is a short period of time.

The material components of this spell are a pint of the caster's blood
and a figurine/statuette of the race to be targeted. The blood is
consumed at the time of the casting, and the figurine is also
destroyed, unless the caster makes a successful save vs. spell.

Lazatar's Spellstopper (Abjuration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2 hours
Area of Effect: 100 square foot section of wall per level
Saving Throw: None

This very potent abjuration is used to protect a castle, keep, city,
etc.  from one or more enemy spells. For each level the caster has
obtained, he may protect up to a 100 square foot section of wall; more
than one application of this spell may be cast on a single wall at
once, as long as the areas of protection do not overlap (the caster may
shrink the area of effect to any size less than the maximum, as
desired); in other words, no one brick of the wall may be under
protection by more than one Spellstopper at a time. The protection
afforded by this spell extends to individuals on top of an affected
wall.

The Spellstopper may be used to affect one other spell for each level
of the caster; thus a 19th level caster may provide protection against
19 other spells directed at the protected area. These affected spells
may be *any* spells, with the exception of Wish and Dispel Magic;
however, the chosen spells must be ones the caster already has learned.
Once this spell is cast, any of the chosen spells directed at the
protected area automatically fail; the Spellstopper has no affect on
other spells.

The Spellstopper may be removed by a Wish or it may be dispelled. For
every non-chosen spell cast at the area of effect, the chance for
dispelling the Spellstopper is increased a percentage equal to the
level of the spell.  This bonus is cumulative (up to 25%) and lasts for
one turn. In order to earn this bonus, the wall itself must be
targeted; an attack directed at a defender on top of the wall does not
contribute to this bonus.

As an example, let us assume a wall is protected from, among others
spells, Passwall, and Magic Missile, and that Fireball and Transmute
Rock to Mud are not affected. On the first round, a Magic Missile is
directed at one of the defenders; since the wall protects its
defenders, the spell is stopped. The next round, a Passwall is cast on
the wall; since it too is a chosen spell, the Passwall has no affect.
On the third round, a Fireball is cast at the defenders, and since it
was not named during the casting of the Spellstopper, it has full
effect; in addition, if a Dispel Magic was cast within one turn, it
would have a 3% bonus, since Fireball is a third level spell. Nine
rounds after the Fireball is cast, a Rock to Mud is cast on the wall;
it too has full effect; if a Dispel Magic was cast now, it would have
an 8% bonus applied to it (3% for the Fireball and 5% for the Rock to
Mud). Two rounds later, another Rock to Mud is cast; subsequent dispel
attempts now have and 10% bonus (5% for each Rock to Mud; the 3% for
the Fireball no longer applies, as it has been more than 10 rounds
since it was cast).

Each casting of the Spellstopper temporarily reduces the caster's
constitution by 1d4 points; an hour of undisturbed rest will restore
one constitution point lost in this manner. If the caster's
constitution is reduced to 0 or less by casting this spell, he must
make a successful system shock roll to prevent actual death.

The material component for this spell is a thin sheet of lead, as well
as the material components for *all* spells the Spellstopper will
protect against.

Lazzaro's Murderous Sword (Enchantment)

Range: 50 yards
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is a version of Mordenkainen's sword, but with a twist. This
spell causes a shimmering aura to form around any sword. This sword
will then arise and be at the command of the spell caster. He may order
to attack, defend, guard, or whatever. The sword can respond to
moderately complex tasks like, "Let no one through this door unless
they say the word, ixitayal."

In combat the sword hit any AC on a 19 or 20, it has the same hit
points as a fighter of the level of the caster (18 con), has the same
AC as the caster, and fights like a fighter of the same level (i.e. 2
attacks per round, THAC0 whatever). It attacks as if wielded by someone
with an 18/00 strength (+3,+6). It also has it's own bonuses; it
requires a magical sword as material component. If the sword has any
special abilities these will also be used in the combat.

The sword acts independently of the caster (obviously) and requires no
concentration to maintain. However the caster must remain with 50 yards
of the sword or it falls to the ground, inert (with magic drained from
it). The ways to defeat the sword: render the caster unconscious, hit
it for loss of hit points, encase it in something, or successfully
dispel it.

As discussed above the material component is a magical sword, the magic
of which is consumed after the spell ends (gives high level mages a
reason to collect all those magic swords and destroy them in the
process). The other material component is a gem with the soul of
fighter trapped in it. This gem becomes embedded in the sword during
the spell. Each time the gem is used, it has a cumulative 5% change of
shattering, freeing the poor soul inside. Obviously the gem is not
consumed after the spell ends.

Lichdom (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3 hours
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, the wizard saves vs. Death. If he fails, he
becomes a lich, otherwise he dies. Should he be raised or resurrected,
he can try again. This spell makes clear why a wizard has to be 18th
level to be able to become a lich.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lorth's Translocation (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Lorth's Translocation is a the most advanced teleport-class spell ever
devised. Given a description of any sort, the caster is able to place
himself at the specific location. The description might be a detailed
mental image, a verbal description, a painting, "Thirty feet due east",
"The center of the room in which stands the Sceptre of AshkaMankh", or
anything else sufficiently precise. If there does not exist a location
such as the one described, nothing will happen. If the description is
insufficiently precise ("A field of grass", "The center of a forest"),
the spell will have no effect. If the location does exist, then the
caster will be placed there, no matter where it is.

This spell can transport the caster to any plane, any distance. Note
however that it is very, very difficult to describe a specific place in
planes such as the Astral or the Ethereal, due to the lack of good
landmarks. Of course, if there should happen to be a solid object in
the place described, the caster is slain instantly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Swarm (Alteration)

Range: Special
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The magic swarm spell is both a very potent, and a very unstable
spell. With this spell, the wizard may bind up to three attack-type
spells (those that cause any type of damage) together into one spell.
The caster begins the incantations of the magic swarm and then "loads"
the spells to be bound into the swarm (this effectively casts the
spells - the proper components are required, and the loaded spells fade
from memory; the magic swarm is the "target" for these spells). The
wizard then finishes the binding process by continuing the incantations
of the swarm. This entire process takes two turns plus the casting
times of the spell(s) to be bound.

When the magic swarm is actually cast, the bound spells are released
simultaneously (this has a casting time of 3). However, due the
unpredictable nature of this spell, there is a chance that some of the
bound spells may not function normally. At the time of casting, the DM
rolls 1d3; the result is the number of spells that work properly - the
remaining spells fizzle and are lost (the spells go off in the order
they were bound, so it is important to keep track of the order).

Due to the extreme exertion required to cast this spell, the following
penalties/stipulations are placed on its use:

- only one magic swarm spell may be memorised in any two day period.

- after a magic swarm is cast (actually cast, not after binding), no
further spell casting is possible for one turn (10 minutes).

- after the spell is cast, the caster temporarily loses 1d4
constitution points; if this brings the wizard's constitution score to
zero or below, a system shock roll must be made; if this roll is
failed, the wizard dies, otherwise he falls into a coma until his
constitution is restored to a positive value; it takes one hour of rest
to restore one constitution point lost in this manner.

- if the magic swarm is not cast in one hour per level of the caster,
the caster must make a saving throw vs. spell; if this save fails, the
swarm will discharge will full effect, centered on the caster (1d3 is
still rolled to determine how many spells actually go off and how many
fizzle); if the save is successful, the magic swarm simply fades from
memory and is lost (along with all bound spells).

The material component for this spell is a bag of holding (which
effectively "holds" the spells in the bound state). When the spell is
cast, the bag is destroyed unless the caster makes a successful saving
throw vs. spell at -2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mental Library (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: See below
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the Mental Ledger spell in that it enables the
caster to record information in some unused portion of the casters
brain and then gives the caster the ability to read the information at
a later date as if they were reading it in their own hands.

This spell actually will allow the caster to hold as many spells as he
knows and any that the caster might learn in the future. In fact, any
spells that are stored in the casters brain through the use of the
spell will remain there essentially forever available for recall when
necessary.

This spell also allows the caster to record information other than
spells in this "storage area". The caster can store the entire contents
of any book that he reads and can access the book at any time in the
future just like the spell Mental Note.

Too add more information after the spell is cast requires that the
caster cast the spell again at the time that they wish to add more
information.

The material components for this spell the first time it is cast is a
specially prepared lead crystal which has been enchanted to absorb
magical energies. The value of this item is no less than 50000 GP. To
add more information in subsequent castings, the caster would require a
pure lead crystal of 5000 GP (as in the mental ledger spell).

This spell is highly useful for mages on the go who want all their
spells and library without having to carry it around for themselves.

The casting time depends on what is being stored. It takes one hour per
spell level per spell memorised, and it takes the time it takes the
caster to read a book to store a book (the caster is allowed to take
short breaks and sleep if there is a large amount of information being
memorised).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mezzalldam's Choking Fist (Evocation)

Range: 3 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a disembodied hand similar to those of Bigby's
Hand spells, except it is much smaller (about the size of an ogre's
hand).  It will attack as directed by the caster (no concentration is
required to do so - the wizard simply chooses the target).  The hand
does not automatically hit, but will attack using the caster's THAC0,
with a +2 "to hit" bonus.

If a hit is scored, the fist closes tightly around the victim's throat;
it will continue squeezing until the target is dead, or until the hold
is broken.  Once per round, the fist's lock may be broken by making a
successful bend bars roll (the victim has a 10% penalty applied to this
roll); only one person may do this each round, due to the small size of
the hand.  Other party members who try to free the victim must devote
their entire attention to this for the round (i.e. no other action may
be taken, DEX bonuses to AC are lost, etc.).

Each round the victim is choked, a system shock roll must be made; each
additional round (past 1) of constriction inflicts a 5% penalty to this
roll.  If this roll fails, the victim fall unconscious and if the hold
is not broken the following round, the victim dies.  While a victim is
being choked he may perform no other actions (other than breaking the
fist's hold) - all the target's efforts are required to fight the
effects of the constriction.  The fist will continue attacking until it
is destroyed/dispelled, or until the spells' duration expires; the
caster can also end the spell with a single word.

The fist may be destroyed by direct attack; it has an armour class of
-2 and as many hit points as the caster at full health.  The fist will
also break its hold on a victim every time it loses half its remaining
hit points.  Note however, that attacking the fist while it is choking
a victim is dangerous; if an attack on the fist fails to hit, another
normal attack must be immediately rolled against the victim, inflicting
any damage normally.  If the fist's hold is released or broken, it may
be attacked without fear of hitting companions.  If the fist is not
choking a victim, it may be attacked by anyone who beats the wizard's
initiative roll (or by anyone, if the fist fails to score a hit that
round).

The material components for this spell are a bit of bone and skin from
any constricting snake; these components are consumed when the spell is
cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mezzalldam's Lightning Swarm (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 5' wide, 5' per level long ray
Saving Throw: 1/2

When this spell is cast, a 5' wide, electrically-charged, blue ray
shoots from the caster's finger, and strikes as directed up to
distances of 10 yards per level of the caster. The ray travels in a
straight line and is blocked by most obstacles; however, it will burn
through thin, flammable material such as cloth and straw.

When the ray reaches its terminal point, as chosen by the caster (or
when it strikes a blocking obstacle) it will erupt into a lightning
swarm. This swarm appears as a glowing, blue sphere with dozens of
small lightning bolts flashing in all directions. The radius of the
swarm is 5 feet per level of the caster.

Anyone caught inside the swarm suffers 10d6 points of damage; a
successful save vs. spell reduces this damage by half (victims wearing
metal armour suffer a -2 penalty to their saving throw). Those who fail
their save must make saves vs. lightning for all their objects; items
that fail their save are destroyed.

If the caster desires, the swarm may be continued for a second round.
If full concentration is maintained, the caster may move the swarm 10
feet per level of the caster; if the caster's concentration is broken,
the swarm stays where it is. Anyone that comes into contact with the
swarm during the second round suffers 5d6 points of damage. Those who
successfully saved on the first round automatically save on the second
round as well.

The material component for this spell is the heart of a blue dragon,
which is consumed when the spell is cast. Evil spellcasters have
discovered that the heart of a bronze dragon will also work as a
material component for this spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mystyk's Mystical Missile (Invocation/Evocation)

Range: 10 yards + 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a sparking, blue ray to shoot from the caster's hand;
the ray will strike any creature as chosen by the caster. When the ray
strikes the target, it will evolve into a vortex of electricity that
surrounds the victim.  The target must make a saving throw vs. spell at
-4; if this save succeeds, the spell ends with no effect. If the save
fails, the victim suffers damage equal to 1d8 + 1 per level of the
caster, and the spell continues. Each round, a new save must be made,
with a cumulative +1 bonus (i.e. -3 on the second round, -2 on the
third, etc.); the spell ends if a save is successful, otherwise the
victim is again subject to a damage roll. The target must devote his or
her entire effort on escaping the vortex; if any other action is
performed that round, the save automatically fails and damage is
inflicted normally. If the victim is rendered unconscious by the
vortex, saves automatically fail (although the bonus still accumulates)
until the target regains consciousness.

If a victim is killed by this spell, the vortex will immediately attack
the nearest enemy of the caster; if none exist (within spell range of
the caster), the spell ends. The vortex moves at a rate of 24, and the
new target is attacked normally; the penalty or bonus to the save
resumes at the point it left off when the previous target was killed.
For example, if the initial target was killed during the fifth round,
the new victim's save begins with a +1 bonus. Any number of targets may
be attacked by this spell, as long as the saves are unsuccessful, and a
potential target is within range; otherwise, the spell ends.

The material components for this spell are the heart and scales of a
blue dragon, and any gem worth at least 500 GP. All components are
consumed when the spell is cast.

Nuke (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3 hours
Area of Effect: 100-yard per level radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Creates a thermonuclear explosion of 2 kilotons power per level of
caster. Range is zero so unless used with one of the Carrier spells
this is a suicide weapon.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Word, Vapourisation (Alteration, Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1" per level high cube
Saving Throw: None

When this symbol is cast, it will cause a large volume of inorganic
material to simply vanish and cease to exist as if it had never been.
This effect is instantaneous, and remains permanent. Only a wish can
bring the lost matter back into existence. The volume that is destroyed
cab be in any shape the caster desires up the maximum volume effected.

If any of the inorganic material is somehow magical, then assign it a
value of 1 to 6, using the guidelines from the magic user spell detect
magic where artifacts are assigned a value of 6. This is the basic
saving throw number that must be rolled, or rolled under, using a d20
in order for the object to save and not be disintegrated.

If a magic item has powers or bonuses which could protect it from
disintegration then they must be taking into account for the items
saving throw. An intelligent item cannot be effected by the spell, as
it does not count as an inanimate object. A ring of spell turning would
not be able to turn the spell, but the roll is made anyway and if the
turning is successful, then the ring would get the bonus or be saved
completely. A ring of protection would get it's saving throw bonus,
while a device of protection from disintegration would always save.

The material components of this spell is a pinch of dust from the
coffin of a mummy.

Sarius' Endosmotic Zone of Magic (Alteration)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 day per level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell was researched by Sarius Mendlekine, Lord of
Telnorne.  It is actually used to create a magical rod (3' long and 1"
in diameter) that projects a continual zone of increased magical
potential in a spherical area of effect equal to a radius of 1" per
level, extended outward from the rod in all directions.  This spherical
zone makes magic function at its utmost effectiveness, normally.  But,
it can be used to travel to planes with reduced magical factor ratings
(MF) while keeping a MF rating of 0 within the area of effect.  On
planes with an increased MF the spell simply allows all spells of
9th-level or less to work optimally.  The zone will permeate any area
which is not totally enclosed in a lead casing or protected by an
anti-magic shell which withstands the dweomer.  All anti-magic shells
or effects that come within the zone react as though a dispel magic is
cast upon them each and every round.  Every round the two areas
interact the anti-magic zones have a chance of dispelling as though a
mage of four levels higher than the caster were trying to "Dispel
Magic" against them.  On  planes with a negative MF rating, everything
within the area of effect operates as though the MF rating were 0.  So,
someone with a ring of flying would fly within the zone, but exiting it
would cause them to drop like a rock!  On a negative MF rating plane
anti-magic shells are dispelled at the normal level of mastery or the
spell-caster and all spells cast by any class of characters, whether
native to the plane or not, operate at a normal MF rating of 0.

The spell's duration (from activation of the rod) is equal to a base 1
day per level in a Prime Material plane with a MF rating of 0.  On
negative MF rating planes, the duration is calculate as the total
number of whole days left for the rod to operate divided by the result
of the MF rating multiplied by -1.  For example, a 20th-level mage
activates the rod and hurriedly enters a gateway to an alternate Prime
Material plane with a MF rating of -5 (since the spell must be
initially cast on a plane with a MF rating of 0 or better).  The
duration would be determined thus: 20 days/(-5 x -1) = 4 days.  But, if
the mage had operated the rod (for more than 1 turn) before entering
the gateway it would have lost a days duration and be calculated as:
19/(-5 x -1) = 3.8 days, or 91.2 hours, or 547.2 turns, or 5,472
rounds.  If the wielder had travelled to a plane with a MF rating
greater than 0 the spell's duration would be calculated as the base
duration multiplied by the MF rating of the plane.  Whenever the rod
changes alternate Prime Material planes (even if they both contain the
same MF rating) its duration is recalculate with the current remaining
days of operation left used as the base for determining the duration of
the spell (disregard any remaining duration that does not equal a day
or more in length).  If the rod travels from a positive MF rating plane
to a negative MF rating plane the rod is totally disrupted in the
transferral as though the spell had ended, and vice versa.  Dispelling
magics will only affect the rod for one single round unless they are
cast by a Demi-Power, Lesser Power, or Greater Power, in which case the
a successful "dispel magic" will cause the device to become disrupted
as described below.

The rod is the only material component of this spell.  It is made from
the purest mithril and rune inscribing agents (costing at least 7,000
GP).  Then, 9 deep blue amethysts (1000 GP each) are inset to the side
of the rod among the various runes of power, and a large sapphire
(1,000 GP) is affixed to the top.  Once the rod has been fashioned (2
months creation time minus 1 day per level of mage working on the
inscribing of the runes down to a minimum of 1 month) this spell can be
cast upon it, empowering the rod with enormous magical potential.  From
this point, the rod remains dormant until its power is activated by
speaking the proper command word and willing the rod to function.
Until the rod is activated the casting mage loses a single 9th-level
spell casting slot because of the bond that he has established with the
rod's dormant power.  While this spell could be inscribed onto a scroll
it would still require the rod as a material component and the mage who
inscribed the spell would not regain the spell slot until the potential
of the scroll was released through copying it into a spellbook or
casting it onto the rod and activating the rod.  (Note: An apprentice
may be used to inscribe the runes upon the rod freeing the learned
master to further research).

Although almost any sentient creature may utilise the rod, in the hands
of the original spell-caster it will convey a personal magic resistance
equal to his level of experience (and cumulative to any other magic
resistance he may be employing).  On any Prime Material plane the rod
will also act as a Rod of Striking, conveying a +3 magical to hit bonus
and striking for 3d6+3 points of damage per round.  The rod may only
strike once in any melee round no matter if the creature wielding it is
capable of multiple attacks with weapons.  During the last turn of the
spell's duration the rod will begin to hum extremely loud (hearable in
a 1/2 mile radius.  During the last round of the spell's duration the
rod will glow with extremely powerful magical electricity, causing 1d20
hit points of damage to all that touch it, per segment of contact.  In
the last round is will flash with a bright light (causing all in the
zone to save vs. rods or be blinded for 1d20 rounds) and then cease to
function.  This last burst of energy transmutes the mithril rod into
pure lead, causes the runes to dissolve, and disintegrates the 10 gems
into a useless powder.

Sillvatar's Dragon Breath (Conjuration/Summoning)

Range: 10' per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a dragon head similar to that created by
Sillvatar's Dragon Bite; however, instead of bite damage, the caster
may direct the head to make a single, instantaneous breath attack. The
dimensions and composition of this breath attack are as per the dragon
the material component is from.  The damage inflicted by this attack is
equal to an attack from the appropriate dragon of age category 1-6
(determine age randomly). For example, if a red dragon is the source of
the material component for this spell, and a 4 is rolled for the age
category, the breath attack takes the shape of a 90'x5'x30' cone of
fire, and inflicts 8d10 points of damage. All victims must save vs.
the worst of spell or breath weapon to receive only half damage;
possessions are treated as if they had been hit by the actual
corresponding breath weapon (if the victim's save was successful,
possessions are not affected).

The material component for this spell is the heart from any type of
dragon; this component is consumed when the spell is cast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sillvatar's Superior Summoning (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible

Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2 turns (casting time of 5 to trigger summons)
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The caster of this spell is able to summon to his aid one or more
prechosen individuals; the creatures to be summoned must be chosen at
the time the spell is cast and must be willing to receive the summons.
The total number of levels or hit dice of the individuals summoned must
be equal to, or less than the level of the caster.

When the spell is initially cast, the wizard must follow a set
procedure for each person or creature summoned: first the individual
must be marked with a Wizard's Mark spell; this must then be made
permanent through the casting of a Permanency spell (to prevent the
mark from wearing off). Finally, the Superior Summoning is cast; this
entire process takes two turns, plus the casting times of the other two
spells. Each recipient must be marked by a separate Wizard's Mark, but
a single casting of the Permanency spell, as well as the Superior
Summoning will suffice. These marks will be visible only to the caster
and the recipient (although a True Seeing spell or similar magic will
reveal them) and will remain until dispelled or the spell is
triggered.

When the wizard wishes to trigger the spell, the final incantations are
uttered along with the names of each of the recipients (this has a
casting time of 5). The summoned individuals will appear anywhere
withing 100' of the caster, as desired. The individuals to be summoned
must be on the same plane as the caster when the spell is cast
(triggered) or they cannot answer the summons.

The reverse of this spell, Sillvatar's Superior Sending, will send the
marked individuals to a pre-chosen location (a separate location may be
chosen for each recipient). The result is similar to a Teleport without
Error spell, but with a separate location for each recipient. The same
procedure must be followed as for the Superior Summoning, and since the
Wizard's Mark disappears when the individual is summoned, multiple
castings of this spell, as well as the Wizard's Mark and Permanency,
are required to send summoned creatures back to where they came from.

The material component for this spell is a diamond worth at least 500
GP for each individual to be summoned. These diamonds are powdered
and sprinkled on the Wizard's Mark (this fulfills the component
requirements for the Wizard's Mark spell as well).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sphere of Annihilation (Evocation)

Range: 4"
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 12 hours
Area of Effect: 2' diameter sphere
Saving Throw: None

This ancient and arcane spell was first found in the Libram of Tel'
Aknus the Mad.  It is used to create a sphere of annihilation.  The
mage must prepare a special magical device, which costs 15,000 GP to
construct, to house the energies required to bring the sphere into
existence.  The construct is made of the rarest or ores, adamantite,
and requires a full year of work by a master smith to fashion.  A
Master Alchemist must then fuse ten vials of Essence of Platinum, ten
vials of Essence of Gold, and ten vials of Essence of Silver, in this
order, into the construct (which looks something like a giant spider
when finished).  This will take two weeks per vial and the chance of
success is equal to the alchemist's chance of creating said essences
(checked for each vial fused to the structure) and any failure means
that the entire structure has been transmuted in the metal of the
current essence which is being fused into the construct.

Then the casting procedure can take place.  It consists of a highly
ritual ceremony requiring a black pearl of at least 1' in diameter
being placed inside a magic circle and then calling forth the various
magics of the planes to instill the pearl with anti-planar power of a
sphere of annihilation.  The spell then temporarily doubles the current
hit points of the casting mage as it starts.  Every hour of casting
time instills the pearl with more and more power.  At the end of every
hour's casting the mage must roll a successful saving throw vs. magic
which is unadjusted by any means other than his current level of
mastery.  If successful, the casting continues for the next hour.  If
unsuccessful, the mage takes 1d20 points of damage for an unsuccessful
hour of casting and the casting time is extended for anther hour.  The
spell will only be successful if 12 hours of continual casting is
completed.  Remember that if the spell is successful the mage must
still attempt to bring the sphere under his control.  This spell in no
way gives any special bonuses for control attempts.

If the mage is reduced to zero hit points the pearl disappears (in a
harmless, but spectacular flash of light) and his strength and
constitution are reduced to 1 and he is thrown into a coma, losing
knowledge of all spells currently memorised.  These statistics and
normal hit points are regained at a rate of 1 point per day or total
rest unless some form of magic is used to increase healing.  Until the
mage reaches half of his original constitution score he is extremely
susceptible to diseases and will take 4x the amount of damage a disease
would normally inflict.  When half of his original strength is restored
he may save vs. spells each day to see if he comes out of the coma.
Failure means that he remains in the coma.  Once the mage comes out of
a coma he will be in a ravenous state and will not be able to regain
spells again till he has eaten and rested for as many days as he was in
the coma.  Success or failure notwithstanding, this spell will always
destroy the construct and the pearl used as the material components.
If the spell is successful, the construct and pearl are sucked into the
sphere, and if unsuccessful, the construct crumbles into a useless
crystal substance and the pearl disappears as mentioned above.

If the spell-caster is physically touched during the casting of this
spell by anything, including the power of another magic, and sustains
damage which subtracts from his hit points or any ability score or
level, the pearl will explode in a force of magic dealing out damage
equal to 1d20 per hour of casting time that has passed (rounded down)
in a radius equal to 1" per hour of casting time that has successfully
passed (again, rounded down and a unmodified saving throw vs. spells
will allow anyone in the area of effect to save for half damage).
Also, when this happens the extra hit points disappear (if they are
still present) and the mage takes damage from his normal remaining hit
points.  Death by this explosion means that the body has been
disintegrated, ruling out "raise dead" or "resurrection" spells for
bringing the victim back to life.

Symmetry (Evocation)

Range: 0
Components: V, S, M
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3 hours
Area of Effect: 10-mile radius sphere
Saving Throw: None

Composed of 2 level 9 spells which have to be cast simultaneously.
Creates within a 10-mile radius a condition in which the symmetry
between the physical interactions which prevailed at the time of the
Big Bang is restored. Everything within the 10-mile radius is
instantaneously gone regardless of magic resistance, god or artifact
status etc. Everything for a couple of hundred miles around gets
burned, vapourised, melted etc. Note that like Nuke this has a range of
zero, so use of Long-Range Carrier is advised.

Telnorne Force Layer (Evocation)

Range: 1"
Components: V, S
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: One 10'x 10' area
Saving Throw: None

The source of this highly improved version of the "Wall of Force" spell
is the Telnorne Mageocrat.  It is used to create a barrier which cannot
be penetrated by any known spells or forces in the multi-universe,
including major powers, avatars, devils, or demon princes.

The casting time of 1 hour is standard, but the mage must also spend a
hour in contemplation, reviewing diagrams and/or charts of the area or
object to which the force layer is to be attached when memorising the
spell.  A force layer may cover an area of up to 10'x 10', and must be
attached to a localised gravity: either an object, a structure, or an
area.  Once cast, only spells of wish-like power may affect the force
layer.

A "Limited Wish" will effect the force layer as a 1/2 strength "Dispel
Magic", an "Alter Reality" will effect the force layer as a 3/4
strength "Dispel Magic", and a "Wish" will effect the force layer as a
full strength "Dispel Magic".  The force layer may be attached to
moving objects, but only those which are of one piece and move in
conjunction to something else.  For example, a chest (with hinges)
could be covered, but the chest would still need to have a break within
the spell effect, so only the top or the bottom of the chest would be
affected.  Placing the spell on a wagon would effectively make the
wagon indestructible, but the wagon would never again roll since the
wheels are now locked in place.  But, if the wheels alone (and possibly
the axle if the mage was inventive) were protected the wagon would
still roll.  Of course, after the wheels eventually rotted away in a
few years the spell area would still be in effect and invisible wheels
would still roll.

When this spell is cast on the Prime Material plane the area of effect
extends into the astral and ethereal planes, although the force layer
will still be invisible.  Nothing will stick to the force layer except
for another force layer which is attached to a previously cast one.
Paint, dust, and powders will simply roll off its surface.  Only Dust
of Appearance will stick to the force layer, and then only for 1d10
rounds.

Uldark's Ultimate Summoning (Conjuration/Summoning) Reversible

Range: 10 yards per level
Components: V, S, M
Duration: 1 round per level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is Uldark's response to his friend Sillvatar's spell,
Superior Summoning [q.v.]; it is not as powerful (in terms of levels)
as Sillvatar's spell, but is more versatile, and requires less
preparation time. This spell allows the caster to summon any creature
of the wizard's choice; only one such creature may be summoned per
casting of this spell, and the summoned creature's hit dice may be no
more than two-thirds the caster's level (drop fractions).  A certain
species of creature may be specified in the summoning (or in the case
of an adventurer, class and level), but a specific individual may not
be called; for example, the caster may summon a 12th level Paladin, but
may not summon a specific paladin by name.

The summoned creature appears anywhere within the spell's range as
directed by the caster. If a good caster summons an evil creature (or
if an evil one summons a good creature) both the creature and the
caster must roll a save vs.  spell. If the caster succeeds and the
creature fails, the spell proceeds normally; if the caster fails and
the creature succeeds, the creature will attack the caster immediately;
if both fail, the creature ignores the caster (the caster may still
attempt to gain control of the summoned creature via some other
magic).

Of course since Sillvatar's spell is reversible, Uldark felt his should
be as well. The reverse of this spell, Uldark's Ultimate Banishment,
sends the previously-summoned creature back to its place of origin.
This will only work on a creature who was previously summoned by this
spell. If the creature fails a save vs. spell at -4, it is immediately
sent back to where it came from.

The material component for this is a ruby, diamond, or emerald worth at
least 800 GP. The gem is consumed with the casting of the spell.

Hi,

I hope you've enjoyed the ASCII Net Spellbook.

Anyway, I'm in the process of compiling the same kind of files for the
occasional Priest, and I would like to ask you all out there to send me
every spell you've got for them (don't hesitate to post them if you
think that's more convenient than e-mailing).

Also, any feedback on the former files is more than welcome, especially
comments on the lay-out or on the level the several spells were listed
in.

Also, if you have any more magic-user spells, which I can add to the
list, please e-mail them to me or post them, so that they can be
included in my next ASCII Net Spellbook update.
