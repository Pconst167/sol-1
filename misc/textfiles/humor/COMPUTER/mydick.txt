
As we discovered earlier, finding a suitable name for a system can be a trying
experience.
After trying the name "MYDICK", we experienced some difficulties with our 
name and dialing the wrong number.

Senerio:

Man calling field service, dials wrong number.

ring......ring......ring..... (sexy female voice answers) "Hello?"

"Hello, I'm calling to report that MYDICK is down."

"Oh, really, and how may I help you?"

"Well, I'm hoping that you can tell me how to get it up."

"This sounds interesting. OK, I can try. Assuming it's not from over using
it, do you know what caused it to go down?"

"It got struck by lightening."

"GOODNESS, thats awful!!!"

"It's not too bad. It's getting old anyway. I usually only play games with 
it"

"A lot of my co-workers use theirs for business. Maybe, someday."

"I don't know about using it for business, but only for games is a little 
bit of a waste, too."

"Well, since the lightening storm, it doesn't do me much good, anyway."

"I must admit that you seem to be taking it rather well. My boyfriend would
be devastated."

"Oh, it's not such a big deal, it's just a small one. I wanted a larger
one, but I couldn't swing it."

"HUMPH, just how big is it?"

"It only stands about 36 inches."

"ONLY 36 INCHES???"

"Yeah, I've seen some as big as 52 inches."

(silence)

"Hello?"

"Oh, I'm sorry, I uh, you should be able to swing that!!!"

"They're kinda hard to come by."

"I can imagine. That's what I call hung!!!"

"Yep, it's hung alright."

"Have you tried doing anything with it?"

"Yeah, I tried booting it and I kicked it twice, but it just won't respond."

"Jeez, didn't that hurt?"

"I hurt my foot when I kicked it the second time."

"Damn, I'd think you might be  a little more gentle with it. I think
if you play with it, you can get it to work again."

"Oh, I've played with it for alomost 2 hours now and it just won't come up.
It seems like it's going to work OK, but then it gets hung in a loop."

"My this sounds like a tough problem."

"It's not an easy one. Could you come over and take a look at it?"

"You bet!!! I'd love to see this."
