---------------------------------------

	 Elite Commandments:
	 -------------------

1] Never admit you have no idea what you're talking about.

2] Never have a good word to say about anyone else but yourself.

3] Join every group that will let you join.  After a few weeks have passed,
   quit & claim they aren't good enough to merit your prescence.

4] Always shift the blame to someone else.  "It's not my fault" should become
   2nd nature to you.

5] Always have nasty things to say about your so called friends behind their
   backs.

6] Hate as many people as possible.

7] Start as many rag wars as humanly possible.	When your up against
   intelligent people (As on Adventurers Tavern, 1982-1986.  RIP), and losing
   your end of the war.  Say "This is stupid and childish, even if I did start
   it", and stop posting.

8] When someone becomes pushy and openly challenges your lack of knowledge
   about something.  Say "I know the answer, but you're not elite enough, so I
   can't tell you".

9] If anyone still dares to question you then threaten them with tough things
   like getting someone to turn their phones off, or charge 10 billion toilets
   on their mothers credit card.  (It doesn't matter whether or not you
   actually know how to do this, or know anyone else who will do it for you.
   This is a favorite tactic of ELITE!@ phreak groups like L0D!!@#1!.) If all
   else fails began chanting "Cable throw, Cable throw, Cable throw" or if you
   are a pirate:  make a frightening rag page on them in your next Copya crack.

[Warning:  Be sure to only use this on a fellow ELITE!@#1!  phreak, pirate or
equivalent ignorant person.  Anyone else will laugh at you & tell you to fuck
off.  Only adding to the questioning of your massive eliteness.]

10] Make as big a fool of yourself as is possible.  Display your ignorance and
    stupidity in a manner that will make itself noticible to the modem
    community at large.  If you are a aspiring elite pirate, get your name on
    as many copya cracks as fast as possible.  Or if you are a up and coming
    elite phreak, start up your own little world (or join someone else who has
    already done this, such as LOD), refuse to see anyones viewpoint but your
    own, & declare yourselves mega-elite.


Remember:  When in doubt, repeat to yourself the sacred chant:	"I am elite, I
can't be wrong, I am elite, I am always right and know everything", repeat
until your confidense is restored (Humming, or accompanyment by a choir, is
optional).

Also be certain to rag on anyone who displays any kind of knowledge about
anything, and is not currently ELITE!@# If he's not elite, he can't be right.
After all, everyone in the universe cares about the "elite hierarchy!", its
what makes the world go around!@#21!!!!
