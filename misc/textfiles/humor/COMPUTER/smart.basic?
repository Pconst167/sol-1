			ALL THE PROGRAMS
			YOU'LL EVER NEED.
			    FOR $600.
		
   Say goodbye to the costs and frustrations associated with
writing software.  THE LAST ONE(*) will be available very soon.

   More comprehensive and advanced than anything else in
existence, THE LAST ONE(*) is a computer program that writes
computer programs.  Programs that work first time, every time.

   By asking you questions in @i[genuinely] plain English about
what you want your program to do, THE LAST ONE(*) uses those
answers to generate a totally bugfree program in BASIC, ready to
be put to immediate use.

   What's more, with THE LAST ONE(*), you can change or modify
your programs as often as you wish.  Without effort, fuss or any
additional cost.  So as your requirements change, your programs
can too.

   In fact, it's the end of programming as you know it.

   And if, because of the difficulties and costs of buying,
writing and customizing software, you've put off purchasing a
computer system up to now, you need delay no longer.

   THE LAST ONE(*) will be available very soon from better
computer outlets.  To place your order, take this ad into your
local dealer and ask him for further details.  On in case of
difficulty, please write to us direct.
