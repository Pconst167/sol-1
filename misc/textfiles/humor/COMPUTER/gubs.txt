                            MO_ICONS_PLEASE

     For some  reason,  the ICONS in a past Fido Newsletter, were not
     the icons I  have  seen  in use the past several years!!!  Where
     did the nose come  from?   Originally,, the set goes as follows,
     excluding some that can only  be  used on IBM, ATARI, COMMODORE,
     etc.

     :)  - smile/happy               :(  - frown/sad
     :D  - big smile or laugh        :c  - pout
     :>  - mischievious smile        :'( - cry
     ;)  - wink                      ;>  - sly wink

     ---<--<-@    long-stemmed rose

      Also worth considering are the following:

     OLM  - On Line Message          OTW  - On The Way
     OIC  - Oh I See                 H    - HUH???
     BTW  - By The Way               LOL  - Laughing Out Loud
     ROTF - Rolling On The Floor     RAO  - Rolling All Over
     LMTO - Laughing My Tush Off     BRB  - Be Right Back
     AFK  - Away From Keys           BBL  - Be Back Later
     BAK  - Back At Keys             WLCM - Welcome
     BCNU - Be Seeing You            L8R  - Later
     ODM  - On De Move               OTB  - Off To Bed
     LTNT - Long Time No Type        TTFN - Ta Ta For Now
     RE   - Again (Greetings, as in "re-hi")
     LTNS - Long Time No See
     M/F  - Male or Female (also known as 'MORFING', as in
     "Oh no! I've been morfed!!")


     I hope  this  make  for  more  "colorful  communicating".   Just
     remember the quote from Alex Bell (no relationship to the famous
     Bell) "Anything that can  be  said  in  a few words, isn't worth
     saying and should be forgotten".    Don't  blame me I didn't say
     it.
