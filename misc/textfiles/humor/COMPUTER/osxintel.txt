OS X/Intel is NOT dead --- just delayed. Here is why:

Mac OS X/x86 is GOOD - very good. I (legally) had the R2 beta, and *I* say it was
good. OK? Now...

OS X/PowerPC was not better! It was just as good, which means now you can buy OS
X either on more expensive Apple hardware or any old crappy PC. Admittedly Apple
hardware "usually" is better than the average PC (open up a blue G3 and see why).

If we can all get the same beautiful OS running on futzy last-years discontinued
(fudge) Packard Bell for $799, Apple isn't going to make much money. This is the
unfortunate truth.

The GOOD news is Apple now is trying to seperate their hardware and software
divisions to make each profitable on their own. Eventually you WILL be able to
order a Mac without an OS, and you will be able to order Mac OS X without a
Mac...

... except at that time OS X/Intel will be IA64 *only*. Intel wants to kill IA32
as quickly as possible, in order to lock out AMD and Cyrix. Those 2 companies
will go broke trying to clone Merced, which is EXACTLY what Intel wants..

Now Apple could fight on on Motorolla/IBM's PowerPC, but why bother? Jump on the
Merced monopoly, take Intel's assistance, and let the DOJ deal with what is
misuse of monopoly...

Don't forget this... you people seem to think x86 is one of your holy open
standards and it is not! Only by reverse engineering and costly court battles do
you have Intel clone CPU's today. The information for IA32 may be common
knowledge nowadays, but IA32 will be replaced by Merced and Intel will try much
harder to prevent clean-rooming of their chips.

And that, my friends, is the future of the Intel platform. So keep an open mind
about Alpha and PowerPC Linux, and fight for The Source so those CPU's remain
viable alternatives to Linux x86. Because without the source you're locked into
Intel forever (as everyone plays Quake3 for Linux on Intel Linux only..)
