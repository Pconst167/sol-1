The following words of wisdom set this issue's theme in motion,
-!-from James Nicoll,jdnicoll@engrg.uwo.ca

"I have received your latest missive. It is a pity that during the
rebellion, neither my husband nor my grandfather found time to
shoot you. [...] I hope you  [have] good health so that you can
continue to bother me at regular intervals."

HEADLINE: RENEGADE BBS POSTS HOMOLKA TEALE DETAILS
       LETTER FROM ABDUL,THE ELECTRONIC GORDON DOMM

Some of the more informative stuff on the Homolka trial isn't even
covered by the ban.  I went to the school library today and dug out
the mircofilm of the Globe and Mail from December 4/93, pD1,D5.one
was hogging the microfilm copier so I couldn't get a xerox. However,
this is what I remember:

Nick Pron (Toronto Star), Christie Blatchford and a reporter from the
Hamilton Spectator all have (separate) books in the works about the
trial. (Where's Max Haines? :) Apparently Paul Teale 'absolutely
hates' Blatchford, the very opinionated Toronto Sun columnist  and
CFRB radio personality. (Personally, I like her work.)

Finally a conclusive reason for Bernardo changing his name to Teale.
He found out when he was sixteen that his mother's husband was in
fact not his biological father.  He dyed his hair and changed his
name to distance himself from his stepfather's Portugeuse heritage.

I'll try to get a copy tomorrow, because I have severe
mental block.

On this end, I'm trying to get an automated file mailer up. The
reason I went with this place was 1) Steve Jackson's reputation
toward electronic freedom and his links to the EFF made it 'friendly'
and 2) they are in the process up upgrading and they told me a
mailing list system is in the works.  The basic reason I wanted this
set up is for people who can't gopher or FTP the articles would have
a place to turn. Eventually, I want this place to be a regular
mailing list, with discussion, etc.

I can't do a mass mailing because I am banned from the anon.penet.fi
server and because the last time I did one, someone whistle-blew and
now the cops are snooping around some of the subscribers at Western
-everyone's addresss shows up in the dist. list, so it's like
shooting fish in a barrel.  Suspiciously, the media seemed to have
abandoned the e-mailing issue for now.  Things might cook up a bit
around April 5th, when Teale's prelim is supposed to be.

You can put up all that stuff for me.

Thanks Tom.  I'll be in touch. [END]
