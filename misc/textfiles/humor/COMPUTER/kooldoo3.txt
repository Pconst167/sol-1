Its CTRL-Q then "A" if you are stupid ...                               
                                                                    
                                                                    
Okay, oh, this must be viewed with AE to make it work with REALtime ...

We will begin our story with Lynol Leech Jr. this time, Lynol is just in the
process of booting his computer : Added footnote : leeches seldom have auto -
start ROM, so they boot and start in machine language ...

SYSOP BREAKING IN FOR CHAT ...

Sorry but that is not dl-able for now (reserved for Jo-nas) call back ...

WHY?

he wants it.

GIVE IT TO ME FIRST!

no way.


(Ed note : Lynol is being very brave for a leech at this point, but he finally
gives up, wets his pants, and disconnects ...)

AE : H)ANG UP
->

[click - powerswitch, another leech foiled, but the job is only half done,
         ONLY YOU can prevent leeches, and keep them off the boards ... think
         about it for awhile, are YOU a leech?  If so follow instruction in
         K-K00L D00DS vol.1 by the edge ... a public service message from your
         local Quiet Riot guild ...]

Oh, and the board Lynol called was the >Grunt< AE, but that was not necessarly
the sysop talking in chat (it wasnt him because he probably would have thought
it was me and hung up ... I like to bother him ...) and the number is

Ed note : If anyone wants to write a vol.IV go ahead, if you (are stupid) and
dont know how I did that REALtime thing, I just put allot of CTRL-X 's wherever
I wanted a pause ... if CTRL-X futzed your computer and melts your disk drive,
well I suppose I have to say I'm sorry (hehe) ... later,
