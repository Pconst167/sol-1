Can't cast a void type to type void (because the ANSI spec. says so, that's
why)

This one is not exactly an error message story, but it's close, so here goes:

Our department is currently developing a Diagnostics package for IBM-PC boxes,
and as one of our intermediate INTERNAL releases, we added a new menu, with
help screen etc, for a set of functions we were about to add. It went through
the normal internal review cycle, with the Dept head spending some time looking
at it as well.  Unknown to us, the dept head shipped a copy to a customer to
get their comments.  The memo we got back from the customer was quite funny,
and I quote:

  The SYSTEM UTILITY menu functions have not been implemented. Therefore
  no comments for this.  Help for this menu is somebody's idea of a joke!
  I can only assume the help will be changed when the menu functions have
  been completed

The dept head had never looked at any of the help menus, so he didn't know
what was going on.  When he came back to us to find out what the problem was
this is what he found:

   Attention K-Mart shoppers: Blue Light special in out SYSTEM UTILITIES
   department.  for the next 10 days we will be taking requests for the
   utilities that you think should be here. Thank you again for shopping
   K-Mart.

Needless to say, the dept head was P-Oed, but he ignored the

  INTERNAL USE ONLY
disclaimer we had put with the software.

probably not funny, just wierd

put in a message. Someone said the only person that could ever get into
this deep a mess is Linda, so they put a message that said

Back in the dark ages (1967 or so) I rewrote a large part of the IBFTC
Fortran compiler for the IBM 7040 to add in most of the goodies which
were becoming available in compilers for other machines.  (The primary
models I used were S/360 FORTRAN G and the Sigma 7 Fortran, but I
stole ideas wherever I could.)  Keeping track of the data within the
compiler was a complex chore (at the time I was in grad school, and
I was the only staffer on the project...can you say "long hours"?)

I wrote in numerous checks on the internal procedures, but didn't have
much in the way of recovery code if inconsistent data were detected
except to abort with an error message.  I swiped the error message from
a GE system; as I wrote it the text was:

When I was in college the entire school was using a single PDP-11/40
under RSTS/E.  We had somewhere around 20 DECwriter II's (LA36's) for
use by the students in various places around the campus.  One evening
I encountered a terrified beginning FORTRAN student who had encountered
a bug in the FortranIV compiler we were running at the time.  Something like:

        FORTRAN FATAL INTERNAL ERROR
        FATAL COMPILER DAMAGE REPORT FOLLOWS

followed by a page and a half of register and stack dump info.  This
student was convinced that he'd broken the compiler, and that he'd be
in big trouble for breaking the compiler for everyone else.

At another point that year, (April 1) someone (I won't say who) edited the
system error message file.


        ?Invalid Character At Terminal -- Please Go Away

> "Error:  Error ocurred when attempting to print error message."

I once blew away my VMS shell process by redefining the standard error file
SYS$ERROR (I think, it's been awhile).  You execute the command and things
are fine, then you run your pascal program which dies with an error printed
to PAS$ERROR.  PAS$ERROR is assigned to SYS$ERROR, which is assigned to
something invalid.  The OS wants to tell you that the error channel is
invalid, and what does it try to do?  Print on SYS$ERROR.  At this point, I
got a hexadecimal register dump(!!) and blown off the system.  And this was
on a "commercial" OS.  How graceful.

Shortly after I started work at the Stephen F. Austin State University computer

She had been trying to do her FORTRAN homework, and had run across a bug in the
FORTRAN compiler (ANSF on Honeywell CP-V).  On her printout was some diagnostic

Break Rob's knuckles.

I've always wondered who Rob was, and what he did wrong.

The only problem with that is that many PC based C compilers don't include
a lint program.  It makes sense that the programmer at least have the option
of enabling various warning messages.  Strangely enough, I once comitted
the exact opposite mistake.  I had a C statement like this:

            i == j;

The compiler (bless its little heart) gave me the warning:

The VS/PASCAL compiler under VM/CMS (there, that's two V's already and I

The classic short message was from JOSS, one of the early interactive

called the JOHNNIAC).  It was on a small machine.  It had one catchall
message:

                EH?

this was based on the premise that the error would be so blindingly
obvious to the programmer that no further indication of the nature of
the error was required.

Wrong.

(I worked in another interactive system that thought this was such a
cute idea that they used it.  This was a mistake.  If you knew the
language, the cause of the error may have been obvious, but if you
didn't know the language you were in deep trouble.  They extended this
philosophy to the printed documentation!)

We used a language called JEAN on ICL's 1900 series. We knew this was a
dialect of JOSS but it must have been closer than we knew as it used the
same error message.

The JEAN error message I liked was "Your expression has defeated me" which
was generated by a program such as
     1.1 X=X
     1.2 PRINT X

I never understood this until I was explaining to someone the meaning of
recursion in Algol. To demonstrate that simpler languages could not
handle recursion I gave JEAN a recursive definition of a factorial and
to my surprise it gave the right answer!

To understand this you also need to know that in JEAN
     SET X=3 gave the variable X a value.
     LET X=3 defined X as a function.
and the default verb was LET, not SET.

Hence "Your formula has defeated me" meant that it had run out of store
because of infinite recursion.

What a pity Basic defeated the much more elegant JOSS.

Twenty or so years ago, the Fortran IV compiler for the SDS Sigma 2

(That *looks* right.  I'm pretty sure about the number and the text.)

I was somewhat startled by the message, since I knew Fortran programs
were not recursive.

Eventually, in a fit of boredom and despair, I wrote a recursive
program which produced the error message.  Worked fine, too.  So far
as I know, it may still be running.  Wasn't RE-ENTRANT tho.

In most cases I've found that a good way to find out what you can do with
a language is to read well-written descriptions of what you *can't* do
with it.  I got into systems programming in the early 1960s by reading
the error message listings in the FORTRAN compiler, first for the 7090
FMS and later in IBSYS.  Of course, in today's world the vendors would
have collective apoplexy if anyone seriously asked to see the compiler
sources, and the error message descriptions seem to routinely go something
like this:

  Error ABC123D:  User Error

  Explanation:    An unknown error has occurred in an unidentified program
                  while executing an unimplemented function at an
