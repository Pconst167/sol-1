Here's the article in which it appeared.  To be sure, this little gem
got its share of lampooning.  One of the Commodore folks even posted
saying that the lawyer who wrote it admitted it "wasn't too clear". :-)

The above actually referred to WB 1.3.1 beta.  WB 1.3.2 was posted on BIX's
'open' developer conference.  It comes with an "interesting" software license
agreement, which I am enclosing here for your edification :-) It is rumored
that it is closely resembling Apple's software licenses.  Sorry for the foulup.

Enjoy.
