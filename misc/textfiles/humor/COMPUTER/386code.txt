  Undocumented 8088/8086/80286/80386 Instruction Set 
 
Assembler programs are written with short abbreviations 
called MNEMONICS, in other words instead of writing GOTO, 
the programmer writes JMP or even BRA (branch).  These 
instructions are frequently abbreviated into total 
incomprehensibility. 
 
Of course, we all know that abbreviations are arbitrary.  
Anyone who has spent any time programming in assembler knows 
that all computers can be programmed using an undocumented 
set of instructions.  Frequently when an error is made 
writing a program in assembler, a user can actually see the 
program executing the undocumented instructions. 
 
	These instruction vary from machine to machine, but all 
computers have a certain set of them in common.  As a 
service to humanity, I am here revealing these common 
instructions for the first time.
