                        PARASITE PAMPLET #3 : NEW USERS 
                        HOW TO DETECT AND DESTROY THEM 
 
     Many garden owners are worried about the recent infestation of the 
parasites known as "Novum Userum." This family of insect, descended from the
cockroach, are a bane to garden owners everywhere. However, if they are 
spotted early, and appropriate measures are taken, they can be contained. 
     New users often crop up during the November-January months; the climate 
at this time is conducive to their survival, and they often are equipped 
with bright red modems. 
     New users do not mate; instead, this insect has the fascinating ability
to reproduce by eating controversy, and then laying eggs. The eggs are often 
described as "brown things," and they have an odor close to that of 
Limburger cheese kept in the sun for three days. The eggs can be smashed 
or burned, and the threat therein eliminated. 
     However, as the eggs are hard to detect, often an unsuspecting garden 
owner will have new users in his or her garden without being aware of them. 
Garden owners should be aware of the following signs :
 
     - The cry of "SEND E-MAIL. SEND E-MAIL." 
     - A large preponderance of "!!!!!!!" in your garden. 
     - Original titles, such as "NEW USER," or "BOB SMITH." 
     - Opening lines which are something like "HELLO!!!! 
       I'M A NEW USER, AND I'M REALLY A NEAT PERSON." 
     - Overuse of the word "COOL," "K00L," or any derivative
       thereof. 
     - Long, large sentences without any grammatical 
       structure whatsoever. 
     - Users who don't appear to know how to exit the "post message" 
       function. 

For your convenience, a sample user message has been shown below : 
FROM : BOB SMITH 
TO   : ALL

     The most important thing do to, when you suspect that you have new
users in your garden, is to remain calm. There are many precautions that 
can be taken to prevent the pests from spreading. 
     - Sending E-mail to the annoying new user, saying "If you don't be 
       quiet for three weeks, I'm going to have you kicked off." 
     - Getting the Sysop annoyed at the new user, and having the Sysop 
       expel the new user from your garden. 
     - Making friends with the new user, going out to the movies with 
       them, and then torturing them with a knife. 
     - Getting massive hate mail against a new user. 
     - Kindly tell the new user how to not be a new user. 
 
     If you have any questions, you may call your local Department of
Agriculture. If needed, a federal agent will be glad to come out and examine
your garden.

[P.S. Personally, I prefer telling new users how not to be new users.]
