INTRODUCTION: I am not a computer nerd and neither are you. We
	rarley see many computer nerds on the cool bbs's and if we
	do maybe they're checking out the 'programming boards'
	and using their real names. But there is a much
	broader character to which that a computer nerd really is. A
	computer nerd has as much character for a text file,
	as shall we say, Matt Ackeret. Thats why this file was
	written. To explore the nature of those ultra-nerds
	who would make the guys in Reveng of the Nerds look like
	the Fonz. We're not putting down this group of people, we're
	merly making a statement about society. So lets get on with
