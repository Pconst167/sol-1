How to see the secret gag file and credits for MS Access

1)  Start up MS Access.

2)  Open the NWIND sample database that came with MS Access.

3)  Create a new table, give the table one field of any type but don't
    make it a primary key.

4)  Save the table off with the file name "cirrus" in lower case letters.
    Again, when the save occurs, MS Access will ask you about making a
    Primary Key. Don't make one.

5)  Leave the cirrus table up on-screen but make the table container
    window the active window.

6)  Highlight cirrus in the table container window. Just highlight it,
    don't click on it.

7)  Now, with all that, touch "Help" at the top line menu and then select
    "About Microsoft Access..." from the drop down menu.

8)  You now have the version info box on the screen. At the left side
    of the screen is the MS Access logo that has a picture of a key in it.

9)  Position the mouse curser over the MS Access logo (but don't click yet).

10) Now...hold down the CNTL and the SHIFT key together while simultaneously
    clicking the mouse with the RIGHT mouse button.

Notes:

A)  The names of all listed people in each credit area, except one, are 
    displayed alphabetically by their first name (a mistake on field 
    selection??). Guess who's the person not listed alphabetically (he's
    displayed last).
