It seems that my original posting of the purity test did not quite survive
the network so here it is again in completely unrotated form.  If you are
terribly offended by the fact that this filth is unrotated ... good for you!

Again, if you have access to Scribe   and a reasonable laser printer, I can

Disclaimer of Liability

The  user  of  this  test  acknowledges,  understands, and agrees that sex is a
hazardous sport; that a person must copulate in control, and use good judgement
at all times; that their partner's condition vary constantly  and  are  greatly
affected  by weather changes and previous use, that dirty sheets, variations in
terrain and bed surfaces,  spouses/pimps/managers,  forest  growth,  rocks  and
debris,  clothed  obstacles,  and many other natural and man-made obstacles and
hazards, including other users and  customers,  exist  throughout  the  bedroom
area.  Personal  managers  (pimps/spouses)  and sado-masochistic operations and
equipment are  constantly  in  use  and  may  be  hazardous  to  customers  not
copulating  in control. Impotence, collisions, and social diseases resulting in
injury can happen at any time, even to customers  copulating  in  control  with
proper  sexual  equipment.   Inherent and other risks are part of the sport and
exist in your partner. As a condition of being permitted to use the  facilities
of  your  sex object, the user of the partner agrees to copulate in control and
within the limits of his/her ability and further acknowledges and accepts these
hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes the risk of injury or loss to person or
damage to property which might result from the customer's use of the  partner's
facilities.

As  a  further  condition  of  being  permitted  to  use the facilities of your
partner, the customer understands and  agrees  (1)  that  in  the  event  of  a
transfer  of  use  by  another  or anything else in the management's opinion is
misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be  revoked
without  refund;  (2)  that  the partner is the property of the harem and, upon
request, he/she must be presented  to  any  authorized  representative  of  the
pimp/spouse;  (3)  that sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times
when you are in any bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.

Your sexual partner  is  not  transferable;  see  Theft  of  Services,  V.S.A.,
sections 2581 and 2582.

 3    13-Apr-1985  400     CMU/da, fa, tc, no, dt, sv, rz, et al

Version 1 (100)         Created  at  MIT.  Two parallel versions; one for male,
                and one for female. Not much is known about this version.

Version 2 (247)         Expanded to 247 questions. This marked the beginning of
                the unisex versions. The story goes that they intended it to be
                250 questions, but got tired that night and said  "we'll  think
                of three more tomorrow", and tomorrow never got there.

Version 3.3C.1 (400) on 05-Dec-1984 
                First  formal  release  general of this test, version 3.xx. All
                former version were short-lived and tended to  be  bug  ridden.
                Does not discriminate against gays or bi's. Good correspondence
                of  scores (especially in the higher score ranges) between this
                version and version 2. Added in Genesis/History section.

Version 3.4 (400) on 29-Jan-1985 
                Internal version;  never  released.  Source  code  accidentally
                destroyed,  much  to  the  consternation of one of the authors.
                Cleaned up many bugs. Added sections: Disclaimer of  Liability,
                Instructions for Use, Scoring, and Warranty Information.

Version 3.5 (400) on 10-Apr-1985 
                Rebuilt  from  the  3.3C.1  source  and the 3.4 (only surviving
                copy) of the Xerox X9700 laser  printer  hardcopy.  Cleaned  up
                same  bugs  in  3.4;  wiped  out a duplicate question; The page
                number was moved from top of the page  to  the  bottom  center;
                this  was to avoid problems trying to coordinate duplex/simplex
                printing by other people and the positioning of  odd/even  page
                numbers. Added in verbose history section.

Version 3.5A (400) on 13-Apr-1985 
                Found  that  we  had  431  questions  instead  of 400. After an
                all-night hack session, discovered that the problem  lies  with
                the  version  4  (1400)-1  of Scribe and how it treats @section
                headers and  @begin(text).  Ended  up  making  the  pageheading
                contain  a  Scribe  version  field. Also had to add in an extra
                token @newpage on the page that the questions start;  this  was
                to  preserve  the  last  of  the  @style[pagenumber  (@A)] page
                numbers, preserve the same in the Table of Contents, force  the
                page  number  to  be  1,  make  sure that the Contents get that
                right, and to force @pageheading and @pagefooting.

Instructions for Use

This  is  a  fairly  long  test  consisting  of  four  hundred (400  , CD     ,
                                                                   10    Roman
110010000 ,  620 ,  190  ,  103000.100  ).  It  starts  out   tame   and   gets
         2      8      16             Pi
progressively  worse,  or  better,  depending on your viewpoint. There are many
ways of going about taking this test.  You  can,  of  course,  as  your  right,
guaranteed  by  the Constitution, be anti-social and sequester yourself in your
room and take this test all by yourself; however, we feel that the funnest  way
to  utilize this test if to hold a Purity Test Party. All you need is one (1  ,
                                                                            10
I     , 1 , 1 , 1  , 1  ) (read my lips: one) copy of the test, and a bunch  of
 Roman   2   8   16   Pi
friends.  (No  doubt lots of writing implements and paper would be useful too.)
The person with the copy of the test will be  the  test  administrator;  he/she
will  read  the  questions  out  loud  and everybody else will write down their
answers. We have no definite rules as to whether the participants are  required
to  divulge  their  answers,  that  is up to the group to decide; however, each
person's purity score should be made common knowledge.  (The  person  with  the
highest  score  gets to be giggled at for the rest of his/her life.) This works
great at parties and lets everybody know who's easy and who  isn't,  so  you'll
know who to go home with. Don't leave home without it.

All  questions  in  this  test  pertain  to  events  that  have happened to you
subsequent to your  weaning  and  babyhood  infancy.  Anything  that  may  have
happened  before  such  time  is  considered not standing and void; it's a null
point. The term mutual masturbation refers to someone masturbating  you  AND/OR
you masturbating someone else, not exclusively someone masturbating you AND you
masturbating  them.  We  would also like to define having sex in the homosexual
case; homosexual sex has occurred when you and/or your  partner  (of  the  same
sex) have an orgasm while there is some contact between the genitals of you and
those of your partner.

We  would  now  like  to  bring  to your attention that there is no passing nor
failing score. Therefore, one really shouldn't worry too much about  getting  a
high score, even if you do get giggled at for the rest of your life.

I. Scoring

Congratulations,  you  are now the proud owner of a sheet of paper with lots of
itty-bitty answers to the Purity Test. Sworn to excellence of  workmanship,  we
now  give  you  directions  on  how  to  calculate your Purity score. There are
several methods; the calculator method works best, as does the a  la  mainframe
method.   (A DECsystem-2060 works great as a PC.) Of the easier ways:  count up
all your "no" answers, then  divide  this  number  by  four.  This  gives  your
percentage  purity;  the  higher the number, the more pure you are; in the same
vein, the lower the  score,  the  more  of  a  sleaze-bag  you  are.  For  your
reference, we include calculator directions:

     For people with real calculators (HP):

               <#no ans.> [ENTER] 4 /

     For people with other (dinky) calculators:

               <#no ans.> / 4 =

(3)They  come  as  a  set  of  several  balls  strung together. These balls are
inserted into the rectum of one of the participants before sex, and are  yanked
out,  usually by the partner, during orgasm. I think it's supposed to feel good
or something like that.
