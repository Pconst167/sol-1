              DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING CARE OF YOUR DISKS
              -------------------------------------------

     ORIGAMI: 
     Art of paper folding. In order to obtain a nice and effectiveness result,
     put the floppy in the disk drive with strength and without pointing at all

     SMOKE:
     Of cigarettes or anything that could be burnt. When you are smoking blow
     directly to your disk. In that way you will be able to destroy it soon,
     and if you are lucky, damage the drive as well.

     PIRANHAS:
     If you don't have any at home, you can use a stapler, a clip, or simply
     write down on the disk label with a hard point pencil or pen.

     MAGNETS:
     They are wonderful. You can find them in the telephone, in some paper 
     weights, and stuck on the frige door. If you can't find any, you can 
     leave the floppies on the printer or on your display for a while, making
     sure that they are on.

     MAIL:
     Put a disk in an envelope and don't write any warning on it; then mail it
     to someone, and that's all.

     MAGIC TOUCH:
     Touch your floppy. As much as you can. If you have marmelade or butter in 
     your fingers, better. Your floppy will acknowledge it.

     DON'T USE ANY ENVELOPE:
     Archive them without their envelope, piled under a lot of papers and 
     manuals (it is better when the manuals are the VAX/VMS OS 1.00 and its new
     releases).

     DON'T MAKE BACKUPS:
     Of course, if you don't have any security copy, you won't have to worry
     about how to destroy them once you have lost the original

     SUPREME STUPIDITY:
     It is the best way of destroying floppies. If you practice it regularly,
     you'll find new methods to add to this list.
