  New York, __ -- People for the Ethical Treatment of Software
     (PETS) announced today that seven more software companies have 
     been added to the group's "watch list" of companies that regularly
     practice software testing.

     "There is no need for software to be mistreated in this way so that
     companies like these can market new products," said Ken Granola,
     spokesperson for PETS.  "Alternative methods of testing these
     products are available."

     According to PETS, these companies force software to undergo
     lengthy and arduous tests, often without rest, for hours or
     days at a  time.  Employees are assigned to "break" the software
     by any means necessary, and inside sources report that they
     often joke about "torturing' the software.

     "It's no joke," said Granola.  "Innocent programs, from the day they
     are compiled, are cooped up in tiny rooms and 'crashed' for hours on
     end.  They spend their whole lives on dirty, ill-maintained
     computers, and are unceremoniously deleted when they're not needed
     anymore."

     Granola said the software is kept in unsanitary conditions and is
     infested with bugs.

     We know alternatives to this horror exist," He said, citing
     industry giant Microsoft Corporation as a company that has become
     extremely successful without resorting to software testing.
