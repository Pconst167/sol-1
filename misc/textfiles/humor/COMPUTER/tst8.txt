WARNING! THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH MICROSOFT BOB! You may
laugh just as hard as if you were launching BOB, but TECH SUPPORT TALES is
not BOB, nor does it have any aspirations to be MS BOB...despite rumors
that the Gatester may be spreading around. To further prove this point, I
have hired Johnny "The Man" Cochran to illustrate some of the more obvious
differences, should TST have to defend itself against Microsoft in a court
of law.

* BOB is round...TST is square.
* BOB is yellow...TST is black and white (in most cases).
* BOB wears extremely thick glasses...TST has never worn glasses.
* BOB lives on the west coast...TST lives on the east coast.
* TST weighs about 25K and needs a pinch of RAM...BOB ships on 85 floppy
disks and requires a large manual crank (batteries sold separately) to
start it up.

So you see, it makes no sense, it doesn't fit. And if it doesn't fit, you
must've quit.

YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THE STORIES THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ....BUT THEY ARE
ALL TRUE!* It will never cease to amaze me how silly and befuddled some
people get with their computers. Every day thousands of people turn on
their computers (or try to) and come across a problem which they think they
understand. The results of their actions can be amusing and often
hilarious. And let's not forget the boneheaded Techs we all have to endure
from time to time.

  *** WELCOME ***
to issue #8 of TECH SUPPORT TALES - the publication which proves that
stupidity breeds humor. This issue of Tech Support Tales has been sent to
1,286 email subscribers around the globe by a hired militia of armed and
disgruntled postal employees.

HEY PROPELLER-HEADS,
It's not too often that people send me tech tales that send me into a
teary-eyed, gut-busting, laughing fit...but I think you'll agree that some
of the stories in this issue will lighten up those dry moments at the staff
meeting you are voluntarily required to attend this week. Some of these
tales are sooo funny, that they will be included in the upcoming
action-cyber-romance-thriller flick, "USER," starring Steve Case as an evil
hacker with his Atari 540ST.

In other news, the TECH SUPPORT TALES web site is open for browsing. Feel
free to check it out at the following URL:

After Downloading three back-Issues of tech support tales, I am hooked. In
three hours, this has become my favorite E-Zine! I'm In the Eighth grade.
Being one of the few Mac users at my school, I am oft called upon to solve
various Mac predicaments students and teachers get into, so In a way, I'm
like a Tech-Support Rep. Mostly, This falls in to the realm of "Ben! This
$&@# computer won't print!", or "Ben, why Is this printer so slowwwww?"
Sometimes, However, a problem will arise that really tries my Macintosh
knowledge. Case In point: One day I was In the school library trying to
actually get some useful work done. A kid came up to me and said "Ben! This
$&@# computer won't print!" "All right, I said, let me have a look." I
found print monitor running, but printing was paused. Used to this problem,
as our LaserWriters only have two megs of ram and kids often accidentally
pause printing while staring at print monitor spool their document, I
resumed printing without first looking at the document que.  The
LaserWriter responded beautifully, churning out twenty-five or thirty
copies of the SAME DOCUMENT.  Recognizing the kid's name, I delivered the
papers to his Home Room. It seemed that it had been a busy day that morning
, and the printer's memory had been clogged. When his document didn't print
RIGHT AWAY, he had tried printing his document again, and again, and again.

When the bell rung to go to class, he paused the printing, leaving all
twenty-something files spooled on his Mac. As I left, the teacher was
reprimanding him. I sure hope that she'll teach her class what background
printing is from now on!

The Baby Tech Support Line
----------------------------
Ring Ring Ring

Hello! And thank you for calling the Baby Technical Support Line at Saguaro
General Hospital. For Imminent Baby Delivery, please press 1, For regular
Pediatric Questions, please press 2, For Sales and Service, please press 3,
for Technical Questions regarding the Care and Upkeep of your Baby, please
press 4.

Beep.

Ring Ring Ring

Hello, this is Mary with Saguaro General Hospital Baby Technical Support.
How can I help you today?

Yes. Ahh. I'm having problems with my new baby and my wife is out at the
moment. We had our baby delivered at Saguaro about 4 months ago.

Yes sir. What seems to be the problem?

Well, I'm kinda new to this, you know? I mean, I'm here alone with the kid
and I'm not sure what to do next.

OK. Tell me where you're at. What kind of model do you have?

Model?

Yes sir.

Well. It's a baby. And she's been crying for a while now.

What I mean is, can you tell me what obvious features the baby has? Does
she have any defects? Is she missing any fingers, toes? Things like that?

What? Oh no! She's just your basic baby, I guess.

OK. Sounds like our Performa Model. How is the baby behaving now?

Well, she's not eating, and she's been throwing things around and crying.
In other words, she's acting normal.

All right. Have you tried Awaking her without any Extensions?

What are those?

Extensions would be any outside disturbances, such as a lot of noise, loud
pets; a nice quiet environment. She needs no extra stimuli when she wakes
up. She'll be in a lot better mood.

Well, I'll try that.

Have you Rebuilt the Baby lately?

What?

Sir, babies need a lot of care and attention.

That's what my wife keeps telling me. I guess I should start paying more
attention to her.

That's good.

Well, what can I do now?

Well, sir, Rebuilding the Baby is really very simple once you've done it.
You're going to have to sit down in front of the baby and do the following.
After you wake her without any Extensions, give the baby a bath and wash
her carefully. Make sure when you wash her to not let go of her hand until
you see the smiling face!

OK. Sounds good.

Then, dry her carefully and dust her.

Dust?

Baby Powder, sir.

Oh. OK.

Then, place a clean, fresh diaper on the baby.

A diaper.

Yes, sir.

How do you put those things on?

It's all explained very clearly in the manual we sent to you when the baby
was delivered.

I don't think we got that.

Did you inspect your shipping container carefully?

Just a second. Let me look.

(A few minutes later)

Yes! Here it is. Hey, it's got pictures and everything.

Yes sir, we go through a lot of trouble to produce those manuals. You'll
find all the instructions you'll need in there. Plus we've included many
tips.

OK. I'll read it tonight.

Good. Can I have your name and number please?

Jay Pegg, 555-6001.

OK. Mr. Pegg, can I have the serial number of the baby, please?

Serial number?

Yes sir. We place a bar code on each baby which helps us keep track of
them. It's very helpful to us when they come in for maintenance.

(Some crying in the background)

Well, I've got her upside down and every which way, but I see no serial
number.

Sir, the serial number is very small and is usually placed on top of her
skull.

Isn't that dangerous?

Oh no. Not at all. Eventually it just fades away. Just brush her hair aside
and it should be there.

Just a second and I'll look.

(A lot of crying and screaming now)

Uh. I've got her in my lap now. She's very strong, you know.

I can imagine, sir.

Well, let's see here. It looks like S-G-H-3-9-8 Ow! Honey, don't poke
daddy like that!

Are you all right sir?

Huh? Oh, just fine. Let's see S-G-H-3 Damn! Why you little!

(A LOT of crying now)

Hello? Sir?

Just a second. Let me take this plastic dino away from her.

(Not as much crying)

OK. Here we go. It looks like, yes! 666!

Sir?

Hah! Just kidding. OK, the real number is SGH35671-1/22/94. Wheh! There.

OK. I've got the number. Just let me look up that number. OK Mr. Pegg, we
have you listed as living in Tempe? Is that correct?

Yes. That's right.

(Crying coming back strong)

We have no name for the baby listed. What is her name?

Uhh. Actually we haven't named her yet.

Well. It's very simple. Simply Select the Baby and type in her new name.

Really?

Yep. That's all there is to it.

Where do I type?

Well, included with your manual is a key pad which has many different
functions.

Let me look. Hey! You're right. This will be a big help.

The manual explains everything in great detail, and if you still have
problems with your baby, just call us anytime and we'll help.

Sounds great. While I have you on the line, the baby keeps crying all the
time when the mother isn't here. What can I do?

Have you tried a Scream Saver, sir?

Scream Saver?

Yes. We recommend Scream Savers for saving your baby's voice. We have had a
lot of success with sitting the child in front of a TV and turning it to
C-SPAN.

Hmm. I'll try that. What do you recommend when the kid just doesn't want to
go to bed? We've tried playing with her to the point were we are both worn
out and the baby just keeps going.

Sir, if you look on the key pad, you'll see a small cover which opens up.
There we have installed additional options. Try setting the Sleep Mode to
what ever time at night you want the child to sleep. If you have other
times when you wish the baby to be sleeping, such as during Friday rush
hour traffic, simply press the Sleep Now mode and the child will stop
screaming in your ears, and fall peacefully to sleep.

Hey! Now that's a great idea.

Yes sir. It's amazing what  they are doing nowadays.

Well. Thanks Mary for all your help and I'll be sure and ask especially for
you if we need more help.

Thank you for calling the Baby Technical Support Line.

Use at your own RISC
----------------------------
My apartment-mate (we'll call him "Mike") sheepishly entered my room,
asking me if I could take a "look" at his computer.  Now, he rarely relies
on my Mac expertise to solve a problem; he usually takes it on as a
"challenge" to solve it himself.  So I knew this must be a stumper.

He turned on his Performa, and shortly after the extension parade, his
Mac started beeping.  Incessantly.

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

We still had control of the Mac, and could open files, pull down menus,
etc.  But the incessant beeping was maddening.  We checked every control
panel for settings. All seemed O.K.  We changed the error beep in the
"Sounds" control panel, and lo and behold, the incessant beeping became
incessant quacking.

Quack!  Quack!  Quack!

Annoying, so we changed it back.  We lowered the volume in the control
panel, and now instead of beeping, the menu bar began blinking (which is
what normally happens when you mute the beep sound.)

Blink!  Blink!  Blink!

Obviously, first thing I tried was restarting with all extensions off.

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

So, what was going wrong with his Mac?  To what error was the Mac trying
to alert us?  And more importantly, was this a software or a hardware
problem?

Mike's first guess was to replace the System Software (perhaps it got
corrupted?)  As he pulled out the ol' floppies, I figured I'd test if
this would solve the problem.  I started up from the System Software
CD-ROM that came with the computer. Guess what?

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

Just to be safe, I then started up from the Disk Tools.  Even though it was
a minimal system, with no control panels, we STILL heard:

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

No matter how we'd alter or re-install the software, this beeping would
not go away.  Perhaps a loose speaker connection?  Mike finally admitted
that he'd been pulling his hair for hours on this one, and I was his
last hope.  Apparently this incessant beeping was plaguing him for three
DAYS now, and he could no longer concentrate on getting his law studies
done.  I could see the psychosis building in his eyes.  This was a
desperate man.

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

I'd ascertained it was a hardware problem, which meant it was out of my
hands.  Before giving in completely, Mike seemed let down that he'd
actually have to bring his trusty, die-hard Mac in for _service._
Blasted Performas, I thought.  Apple probably cut some corners to make
the models less expensive.  Weird new features, bundled software,
ease-of-installation... I mean, how difficult is it to install and
configure a REAL Mac?

I began to exit the room.  Mike got on the phone.  Defeat.

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

Then it hit me.  I turned around, headed back for the Performa.  At the
base of the CPU were two volume buttons to "ease" adjustment... and the
"up" button was jammed in.  With a quick jiggle, it was released, and...

Silence.  Beautiful silence.

Mike asks me for Mac help all the time now.

Beep!  Beep!  Beep!

We had a member call up with the usual connection problems and the tech on
the call was wondering why it was taking the member unusually long to do
the simplest task such as selecting an item from the menubar. The member
said that her cat had eaten her mouse ball and she had to move the cursor
by putting her finger in the cavity where the mouse ball used to be and
moving the rollers manually.
____________________________________________________________
The computer service tech where I work told me he got a call from a
secretary complaining that the floppy drive in her computer would work. He
went down to check it out and found that she was putting the discs in WITH
the plastic dust sleeves still on them. He asked her why on earth she was
doing that and she said, "Well, I didn't want my computer to get a virus."
____________________________________________________________
I was working at a company that manufactured inter networking hardware for
minicomputers, providing in-house support for other employees of the
company.  One day, a user buzzed me on the intercom and asked, "is the
computer down?"  Since I was reading and did not actually know the answer
to her question, I sat up quickly and began typing on my terminal to see if
the computer had crashed when I wasn't looking.  It hadn't. I replied, "No,
it's up."  "Well, I can't logon," was the reply.  When I got to the user's
office, I checked the obvious things; the terminal was plugged in and
turned on, the keyboard was plugged in and the lights showed "online".  I
reset the terminal - no effect.  I checked the terminal settings (baud
rate, parity, etc.), all correct.  Finally, in desperation, I craned my
neck around the back side of the terminal and noticed that there was one
and only one cable running into the rear of the box - the power cable.  I
asked the user where the other cable was (the serial connection to the
mini) and was told, "Oh, it's over here.  I moved my terminal this morning.
Is this thing important?"
____________________________________________________________
Knowing something about computers made me the department computer "Geek".
That meant that I had to help install nearly all the Macintosh software for
a large radiology department. It was fun to go to everyone's desk and get
them up and running.

One secretary really like to chew winter green lifesavers.  I told her the
old story about seeing phosphorescence when the candy is crushed by her
teeth. She had heard about that and had even tried it out in front of a
mirror in a darkened room.

I smiled and said, "Well, you know, that chewing those lifesavers in front
of your monitor will get the screen to jiggle."

She looked up with opened eyes and while grabbing here purse she said,
"We'll just see."

She popped a life saver in her mouth and LO and Behold! the screen
jiggled (for her).

She was amazed and I grew several levels of esteem after that incident
until she caught me in the hall later and wanted to know why no one else
could see the screen jiggle when she chewed her candy.

CALLER: "A friend of mine gave me your software, and I'm missing one of the
manuals..."

Me: "Hewlett Packard Customer Service, this is Sergio, can I help you?"
Customer: "Yes, I have a deskjet that I need to have repaired"

Me: "We make several deskjets ma'am -- do you know what model yours is?"
Customer: "It's a Hewlett Packard!"

Me: (suppressing a sigh) Yes I know....umm, could you tell me if your
deskjet is color or black and white? Customer: (pause) well....it's beige!

A guy calls because he wants to register his Macintosh Performa and needs
to know where the serial numbers are on the computer and modem.

For the computer: "It's on the back of the computer."
Response: "Oh, I don't think I can get around to the back of it."

For the modem: "It's on the bottom of the modem."
Response: "I've got the modem attached with a C-clamp so it doesn't fall off."

All this and a speakerphone, too.
____________________________________________________________
A co-worker told me this one...

Apparently, he (the co-worker) and a friend were talking.
He must have brought up the subject of the InterNet, because his friend
asked him:

"InterNet? Isn't that that America Online thingy?"
____________________________________________________________
We receive a variety of calls on the 100's of CD's we sell. One of them is
called Midnight Stranger, a game where you roam around a city at night
looking for people to interact with.  A guy called with problems on
Midnight Stranger on a Mac. This is how the conversation went:

Customer: This program Midnight Stranger is locking up on me.

Tech: At what point does it lock up?

Customer: I don't understand what you mean.

Tech: Does it lock up at the same point every time?

Customer: I still don't understand what you mean.

Tech: Does it lock up when you start Midnight Stranger, at the middle of
the game, how far into the game, where?  when?

Customer: Oh, Oh, It locks up when you are at the girl's house and she's
sitting on the couch.

Tech: OK, the brunette?

Customer: No, the dark haired girL.
____________________________________________________________
While on telesales for a software retailer many years back a lady rang and
asked,

"Can you suggest the best home office accounting package? "

I answered, "In my opinion, Mind Your Own Business."

She nearly went through the roof, yelling and screaming how dare
I talked to her like that.
____________________________________________________________
One of our software products is often used to print addresses on
envelopes.

The customer had called the printer manufacturer because every time he
tried to print an envelope, the printer jammed.  Apparently the
manufacturer's tech support person asked, "Does it only do this in
one particular program?" and our customer replied yes, only with
ours.

"Well, you better call them, then," said the support person,
referring to us.

As instructed the client called us and told me about the problem. I
asked him to try printing an envelope and describe what they saw. We
chatted while waiting for the test print.   I learned the customer
was in Miami, in a three day rainstorm caused by tropical depression
Jerry.  He also mentioned  that the printer was brand new, fresh out
of the box.

No luck, the envelope jammed.

Then I asked them to print the same thing on plain paper.  It sailed
through, printing perfectly.

Obviously the humidity had swollen the envelopes to a thickness that
the new printer could not handle.  I mentioned this to him and he
agreed.  "Why did you call me about what is obviously a hardware
problem?" I inquired.

"The printer guy said to because it only happens when printing
envelopes with your product."

"Do you print envelopes with any other software products?"

"No, just yours,"  he replied, then a long paused followed.  Finally
he continued, "Good point.  I'll call the printer guy again."
____________________________________________________________
This guy walked into our shop with a Duo and an English accent. He had
this really important meeting in an hour and couldn't get his Duo to boot
up. So we start it up in our DuoDock with a floppy, only to find _every_
file sitting on the desktop. Apparently he liked seeing the System Folder
all the time.
____________________________________________________________
A customer called a desktop publishing outfit and wanted a poster made from
a color slide. It was a picture of the caller's recently deceased father
with a couple of his fishing buddies in a boat. The caller mentioned there
was a slight problem- in the picture her father was facing away from the
camera. She wanted the photo expert to flip the negative so you could see
his face.  When it was explained that this would only provide a mirror
image of the back of his head she became irate and screamed into the phone-
"If you can take the pimples off those glamour girls why can't you put a
face on my father!"
____________________________________________________________
At 3:37 a.m. on a Sunday, I had just looked at the clock to determine my
annoyance level, I received a frantic phone call from a new user of a
Macintosh Plus. She had gotten her entire family out of the house and was
calling from the neighbor's. She had just received her first system error
and interpreted the picture of the bomb on the screen as a warning that the
computer was going to blow up.
____________________________________________________________
One particular day like any other, an older woman purchased a Macintosh
dragged it home. A little while later we received an angry phone call from
the woman. Apparently, she had set her whole system up without incident
until she came across the mouse pad we included at no extra charge. "Which
side" she demanded, "of the mouse pad faces upwards???" Despite the
brightly colored red company logo emblazoned on one side of the pad, the
woman scolded us for not including appropriate instructions.
