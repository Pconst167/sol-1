|
| % If I had a ) for every dollar Reagan spent, what would I have?

|
| % * How would you describe George Bush

|
| % %Vice-President
| %Vice-President: No such job.
|

|
| % %blow

|
| % 'thou shalt not commit adultery'

|
| And from the bourne shell (sh):
|
| $ drink < bottle;opener
| bottle: cannot open
| opener: not found
|
| $ test my argument
| test: too many arguments
|
| $ "Amelia Earhart"
| Amelia Earhart: not found
|
| $ PATH=pretending! /usr/ucb/which sense
| no sense in pretending!
|
| $ man -kisses dog

|
| $ mkdir "Yellow Pages";fiYellow Pages
| $ mkdir matter;cat > matter
| matter: cannot create
|
| $ lost
| lost: not found
|
| $ found
| found: not found
|
| $ i=Hoffa ;>$i ;$i ;rm $i ;rm $i
| Hoffa: cannot execute
| rm: Hoffa nonexistent
|
| The following are ones that I can't get to work on my BSD 4.3, so I suppose
| that they are stuff from ATT SysV or some other such:
|
| % strip bra
| bra: Cannot open
|
| % sccs what bottle
| can't open bottle (26)
|
| $ cat "door: paws too slippery"
| can't open door: paws too slippery
|
| $ cat food_in_tin_cans
| cat: can't open food_in_tin_cans

Whenever I sense someone looking over my shoulder I type in one of
the above.  And, of course, I keep a file in my home directory called
README which contains the following line for snoopers:

cat: README: not found
