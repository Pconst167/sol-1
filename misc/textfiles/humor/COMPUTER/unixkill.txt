Extended Kill command for Unix

XKILL(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   XKILL(1)

NAME
     xkill - extended kill - kill processes or  users,  including
     Usenet posters.

SYNOPSIS
     xkill [ -signal ] pid ...
              ______   ___
     xkill -l
     xkill username [ @host ] ...
           ________    ____
     xkill -u [ -qs ] [ -p ] [ newsgroup ]
                               _________

DESCRIPTION
     xkill sends a signal to a process or a terminal.  The  first
     two  forms  send a signal to a process. The functionality in
     this case is the same as kill (1).

     When the command xkill is invoked with an username as  argu-
     ment,  it attempts to locate the specified user on the local
     host. If the user is logged on, the signal  ECUTE  (electro-
     cute,  666)  is sent to the user's terminal. This will cause
     the keyboard to electrocute the user.  If the  user  is  not
     logged  on,  the appropriate line of the file /etc/passwd is
                                                    ___ ______
     marked. The first time the user logs on the ECUTE signal  is
     sent to the terminal he is using.

     When the command xkill is invoked with a remote username, in
     the  form  user@host,  a  connection with the remote host is
                ____ ____
     attempted (see xkilld (8)), to send the ECUTE signal to  the
     user's terminal.

USENET KILL
     The -u (Usenet) option is an extension  of  the  concept  of
     KILL file.

     The program will attempt to locate a remote user by scanning
     the  news spool area. When the user is located, a connection
     is attempted with the appropriate host, and the ECUTE (elec-
     trocute,  666)  signal  is sent to the appropriate user. The
     search only considers one newsgroup. If none  is  specified,
     rec.humor  is  assumed  by  default. The program attempts to
     ___ _____
     locate people whose signature is too long, and who  quote  a
     whole  article  in  order  to  comment on a single line. The
     option -s can be used to consider only the  size  of  signa-
     tures,  while the option -q can be used to consider only the
     size of the quotations. The option -qs  corresponds  to  the
     default.

     When the -p (post) switch is used, the user is  electrocuted
     next time he post news.

FILES
     /etc/passwd       to keep track of users marked for electro-
                       cution

XKILL(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   XKILL(1)

     /etc/hosts        list of remote hosts

     /usr/spool/news   news spool directory;  the  news  articles
                       are stored here

SEE ALSO
     kill(1), telnet(1c), xkilld(8)

BUGS
     To kill a remote user, it is sometimes  better  to  use  the
     command  telnet  (1c) using the standard xkilld port (number
     666). When the connection is attempted  by  xkill  (1)  some
     gateways will explode after the user is electrocuted.

     To decide what is a quotation, and what is  a  signature,  a
     very  complicated  pattern  matching  is used. This does not
     always work, even if the  program  hasn't  yet  electrocuted
     somebody who is not guilty of bandwidth waste.
