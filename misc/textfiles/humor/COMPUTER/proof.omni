Proof that 2=1


1) X=Y                     ; Given
2) X^2=XY                   ; Multiply both sides by X
3) X^2-Y^2=XY-Y^2           ; Subtract Y^2 from both sides
4) (X+Y)(X-Y)=Y(X-Y)        ;Factor
5) X+Y=Y                    ;Cancel out (X-Y) term
6) 2Y=Y                     ;Substitute X for Y, by equation 1
7) 2=1                      ; Divide both sides by Y
