 ABBREVIATIONS

     A list of some of the mysterious acronyms much used on
electronic messaging services. Also an exhaustive listing and
decoding of "Emoticons," or icons of emotion, those bizarre
combinations of punctuation marks that, when you tilt your head
sideways, turn out to be pictures of facial expressions, and
worse. Emoticon list contributed by James Bach 76555,273.  File
compiled by Joan Friedman 76701,145.

EMOTICON.1

To help telecom-sters clarify just how humorous their postings
are intended to be, here is a collection of the many faces of
humor, emoticon-style.

emoticon: n. a figure created with the symbols on a keyboard that
          is read with the head tilted to the left. Used to
          convey the spirit in which a line of text was typed.
