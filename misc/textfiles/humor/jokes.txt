  CLEVELAND - The strains of Mister Rogers' neighborly theme song no longer
linger on the airwaves at the Perry nuclear power plant, but anonymous signs on
plant bulletin boards assure workers that Rogers is not dead.

    He has only been fired.
  Promptly at 7:30 a.m.  every day for three months, plant workers would hear
Mister Rogers' reassuring voice crooning over the public address system:
''It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  ...  Won't you be my neighbor?''

  Last Wednesday, Mister Rogers sang for the last time at the Cleveland plant.
Security guards, who had been trying to catch the culprit who had been playing
the Rogers' tape, swooped down a flight of stairs and caught electrician Larry
Nudelman in the act of trying to cheer people up.

  Officials of Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co.  (CEI) weren't laughing.

  They were especially irked when Mister Rogers came on the air precisely at
7:30 a.m.  two weeks ago when CEI was running a mock disaster drill at the
plant which was overseen by officials of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

  Shortly after the theme was played, a CEI official came on the system and
informed workers a test was in progress, and the public ed for unauthorized
business.

  Nudelman says he believes that was what really got the utility angry.

  Nudelman, 38, of Highland Heights, Ohio, says they took his tape recorder and
tape.  They told him to go back to work, but he was fired from his job with L.K
Comstock Inc.  two hours later.

  Nudelman says he started playing the 50-second tape to cheer people up and
help them get started.

  ''A lot of guys drive 45 minutes to get to work,'' he says.  ''They feel like
they've already worked half a day by the time they get there.  ...  It brought
a little bit of something to everyone's day.  I had only planned to do it for a
week or so, but I'd hear people talk about it.  And nobody said it was wrong or
to stop doing it.'' If they had, he said, he would have stopped.

  ''Some days it would be raining hard, and Mister Rogers would come on and say
it was a beautiful day,'' says Nudelman.  ''Then somebody would get on the
public address system and say that Mister Rogers was blind.'' It was good for a
laugh, he adds.

  CEI spokesman Glenn Heffner says Nudelman was fired for unauthorized use of
the public address system.  ''The system is specifically for emergencies and
plant business,'' he says.

  Nudelman says it has been used by workers in the past.  ''Last Christmas, I
guess they had a dog barking Christmas carols,'' he says.

  The system is easily accessible, with phones all over the plant.  Security
personnel began trying to isolate the area in the plant from which the Rogers
message was being sent.

  Nudelman says the day he was caught, guards apparently had been stationed
near many phones.

  Although Nudelman says he believes getting fired was too harsh a punishment,
he does not plan to fight it.  It is the first time he has been fired in 20
years, he says, but he is working at a construction site in Cleveland.

  ''I won't play Mister Rogers over there, but we do have a radio going all the
time,'' he says.

  Though Mister Rogers is gone, the broadcasts are not forgotten.  A notice on
a plant bulletin board offered a $1,000 reward for the capture of the security
guards - referred to on the notice as ''gestapo agents'' - who did away with
Mister Rogers.

What is the fastest animal on earth today?

An Ethiopian chicken.
I began to tell this story in chat one night, but it got quite confusing so I
decided I would write here.

There are many myths and legends about Christmas, but one that happened to make
me smile a bit, was the one about how the Angel got to be placed atop the tree.

One Christmas Eve, a long time ago, Santa awoke feeling quite amourous. He
turned toward Mrs. Claus and snuggled up, but she just rolled over and grumbled
something about having a headache. Feeling rejected, Santa rose out of bed and
went to his workshop to see his Elves, knowing they always cheered him up.

To Santa's dismay, when he walked into his workshop, he found most of the Elves
were quite drunk, and unable to finish the many toys that still had to be done
in time for his delivery that night. Now, quite angry, Santa stormed out of the
shop and went to the barn to check out his sleigh and harnesses. When he got in
the barn he was greeted by Rudolph who had a very bad case of the Hong Kong flu,
and information about how Donner and Dancer, Prancer and Vixen all had the
diarreah, and would be in no condition for flight. Now he was fuming! He went
to the mail box to get his newspaper, and discovered the paperboy didn't wrap
it up and it got soaked. Wondering what else could possibly go wrong, Santa
walked back to the house, and settled into his easy chair when a spring busted
and goosed him, making him spill his pipe tobbaco all over his shirt and pants.
Just then, a knock at the door made him jump. He spang up, very irate to see
who was going to bring him more bad news.
When he opened the door, standing in front of him was a pretty little Angel,
face all aglow, and dragging a large evergreen behind her. "Hi Santa!", she
said, "Where do you want me to put the tree?"
Well, needless to say, Santa did offer a suggestion, and from that day forth,
it has been custom to place the Angel in the same place!
Ho!Ho!Ho! Merry Christmas to all!

			Silicon Vally Guy
		   (to the tune of Vally Girl)


Chorus no.  1:
     Silicon Vally Guy, Silicon Vally Guy.
     Slip on by in tennis shoes;
     Thinks he's glitched, but he's blown a fuse,
     Went on up to Radio Shack,
     To buy some chips for his Univac.

     No, that one's not mine,
     Anyway, it was a complete chip burnout,
     With floppy disk failure,
     A real total system dump, you know, for certain.
     So I said to the output user,
     "Look, would I de-rezz my own program? C'mon man,
     Dont call me, call P.G.&E.
     Go somewhere and have a meltdown, man like burn out."
     Then I went down to the Shack to get some subminiature disk relays,
     Get this, the salesman gives me a new plastic pocket protector,

Chorus no. 2:
     Look out, Intel, here he comes.
     He's the king of computer runs.
     Got his degree from MIT.
     Knows square roots to infinity.

     I scanned that new program down in word processing,
     The one with the huge mammory banks.  Yeah, Julie
     Punch my code, I am certain.
     When I first saw her, I thought, "Whoa, give me a microsecond.
     Could I trip her bit relay or what?"
     She sort of smile at me and I'm thinkin',
     "I've got to access this chick.
     Should I go subroutine or main program?" You know.
     So I just subtly invade her special ring and
     Introduce myself for starters.
     "Hi I'm Ray FIDO."

Chorus no. 1

     So after a few casual edit statements,
     I can tell this unit really dug me.
     I mean, it's modem to the max.
     The program computers, right?
     We make plans to meet at her place,
     I get there and she is on line,
     I mean, like, she's wearing all this software.
     I,m calculating the access time to her front end processor,
     And there is phased jitter enteringall my charged coupled devices.
     Her ambient temperature rises and she is alpha fluxing
     Right before my eyes!
     We skipped dinner.

Chorus no. 2

     After a RAM refresh time interval, she says to me,
     "Ray, I'm all decoded now. I think you better go."
     And I say, "O.K. program. I can handle the endsum."
     "And Ray," she says, "I hope you wont de-rezz me in the morning."
     Hey I'm a silicon Vally Guy!"

Backround:
     Vally Guy, he's a Vally Guy.  Silicon Vally Guy.

     Come here you tattered little data, you.
     Give master control a little phase jitter.
     Punch my code!
     Did I ever show yo my cathode ray?
     It's really tubular!
     Gag me with a microchip.
     Hey, where's my beeper?

  Can you tie 'em in a knot
  Can you tie 'em in a bow
  Can you throw 'em over your shoulder
  Like a Continental soldier
  Can you do the double-shuffle
  When you balls hang low.
The chorus goes:
  Ting-a-ling, Gad damn!
  Find a woman if you can,
  If you can't find one,
  Find a clean old man.
  If you're ver in Gibralter
  Take a flying-fuck at Walter
  Can you do the double-shuffle
  When your balls hang low?
The tune is "The Sailor's Hornpipe"

   Whose cunt was out of fashion.

  Hold her up to the light.

   A man walked into a bar, and sitting on a stool, asked the bartender for
three martinis. "Rough day?" asked the bartender. "No, I just found out that
my older brother was homosexual." replied the man. After downing the martinis,
the man left.
   A week later, the same man, returned to the same bar, and asked the same
bartender for six martinis. "Six?" asked the bartender, "You must've had a
terrible week." "No." said the man, "I just heard that my younger brother was
gay." The bartender poured him the drinks, which he quickly downed, and left.
   The next day, the man returned to the bar, and asked the bartender for nine
martinis. The bartender, thinking that this man had another brother who was
queer, asked the man, "Don't anybody in your family like girls?" To which the
man replied "Yeah sure! Me and my sister do!"
