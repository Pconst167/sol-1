Ok people,
The next person I catch that uploads a pager file, will have his ass booted 
off this board real quick! If I wanted a pager, I would have put one in. The 
reason I don't is because there is always some asshole that decides to page at
3 in the morning! You'll know when I'm in (or want to be in) because I usually
break in just to say hi. So let this serve as my first, last, and ONLY warning
about this. If you want to try me, go ahead!

   Ha! I like this one much better, and possibly if #3 didn't rid you of your
evil ways, this one will ... you will also notice that all of the catalogs
are genuine as of 12:47am on November 19th ... The boards Lynol called were :

                        Kandiman's Keep         (214) 341-1972

   Somebody make a vol.5 at least, this one took me forever ...
