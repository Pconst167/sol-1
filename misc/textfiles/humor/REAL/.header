<H1>Humor: "Real" Guides</H1>
<P>
The theory holds that the concept of "Real" in the BBS Scene rose from
the bestselling book "Real Men Don't Eat Quiche", published in the early
1980's. The audacity of this title, along with the easy copy-cat books
that surrounded it, are probably what led to a massive rush of textfiles
dedicated to listing or describing examples of "Real" Pirates, "Real"
Phreakers, "Real" Users, and a host of other modem personalities.
<P>
In some cases, the action gets extremely metaphysical, with a Guide to
Real Pirate's Guides, and Guides to types that no-one outside of the
author probably knew existed.
