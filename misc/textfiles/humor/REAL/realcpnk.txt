|    With all this shit in the news and now a book about cyberpunks, we have|

|everybody can tell the lamers from the real cyberpunks.  Most of these     |
|wanna-be cyberpunks will probably be offended by what we're going to say,  |
|because the description of what defines a real cyberpunk doesn't apply to  |
|them.  Remember though, cyberpunk is mostly an attitude (this g-file       |
|describes physical manifestations of this attitude), and real cyberpunks   |
|don't get upset over something written in a g-file.                        |

30/30: Pow! What a smack upside the nugget...
Name: Predat0r #1 @5211
Date: Tue Oct 01 02:59:18 1991
From: Blitzkrieg (Kentucky)


Just got the new 2600 in the mail... see page 26. A letter titled "Send a 
Message"...

call 1-800-225-7466 this is the number you call to be removed from AT&T's 
mailing list. you can also state a reason to be removed from this list which 
they make a note of. State something like....

The concern you have with AT&T's public deception in the Craig Neidorf (aka 
Knight Lightning - Phrack) e911 case and their attempt to set an example with 
an innocent person. Also note the jail sentence of Len Rose as a result of 
looking at the source code to UNIX, which is an outrage and a joke. It shows 
how a monopoly can walk across our civil rights just because they have the 
money to do it.

Also take the time to have your long distance carrier switched to another one 
[PAUSE]       which doesn't go on witch hunts for hackers. Boycott AT & T.
