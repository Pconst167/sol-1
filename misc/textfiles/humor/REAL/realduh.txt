Thanks to: Mr. Awesome, for letting me
 be a co on his board (I know it's got
 nothing to do with this file, but I
 had to write something)
=========================
 
 Real DD users:
 
      know what DD means (in case you
    aren't a real DD user, it stands
    for Diversi-Dial)
 
      are bright enough not to fall
    for the old /quiz trick
 
      in the middle of a private
    conversation, never send a private
    message to themselves by mistake
 
      can understand why when they
    type something in and press returnÿ
    it appears again on the screen a
    few seconds later with their name
    in front of it
 
      don't turn the beeps off, no
    matter what time it isÿ
 
      never voluntarily read the 
    advertisments on the system
 
      do not swear when on public
    channels
 
      wait at least 30 seconds before
    hanging up when alone on a system
 
      do not try to send e-mail
    without a secondary password
 
      do not try to hack out other
    users passwords or try to crash
    the system
 
      don't try to upload files while
    on the systemÿ
 
      aren't too cheap to buy a p/w
 
      never try to get onto a private
    channel when 2 users are already
    there
 
      do not bitch at people while on
    the system
 
      and lots of other things that
    don't immediately come to mind

  If after reading this, you thought,
"golly, that reminds me of someone I
know!", and then realize that the
someone is you, maybe you should take
a long vacation from DD systems to keep
your reputation as a cool BBS-hopper
intact. If you've never called, a DD
system, here are the ones in the 312
area code right now and remember the
guidelines I set above.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
General Modem........338-6100
The Bunker...........759-9191
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 If you can't follow my guidelines, I
suggest you go and try to convince Chip
Welch to set up a Chipmunk DD line,
where you would be more than welcome.
