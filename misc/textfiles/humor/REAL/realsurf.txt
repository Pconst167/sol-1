  First of all, I am a surfer and hang out
at the beach all the tyme! I have a FOX
WATER WEAPON and a QUICK SILVER surf
board.



Real surfers are at the beach every day
they can get there. 

Real surfers have girlfriend(s). 

A typical Real surfer favorite line
is "Lifes a beach". 

Real surfers have surfboards! 

Real surfers, most of them, have
skate boards or want to get one.
Usually they are Vision, Madrid,
Santa Cruz or Valterra, but not
always.

Real surfers dont want plublicity. Or
plublicity of where they surf. 

Real surfers want to travel the world
and surf ever were there is a swell.

Real surfers know what a swell is!

Real surfers have the most recent
surfing magazine there is.

Real surfers have wax at all times "
Mr. Zoggs Sex Wax" 

Real surfers still have the board they
started with.

Real surfers love to get buzzed!


Real surfers watched Fast Times At
Rigmount High, Back to the Future, 
and Teen Wolf.  

Real surfers dont care if they wipe
out.

Real surfers dont have nightmares about
a giant wave comming up and killing
them. I did when i first started out.

Real surfers always wear a Gotcha, Hobie, 
Jimmy'z, JAMS or other name-brand
surf/skate clothes.

Real surfers dont care what other
people think about how they ride waves.

Real surfers listen to surf music, like
the Beach Boys, the Surfaris, the 
Ventures and the Belairs.

If a Real surfer had a guitar, it'd be
a Fender Stratocaster.

Real surfers dream about one day
catching that perfect wave out there.


Real surfers dont >only< live on the
west coast or any coast. But most of
them do. 

 Well i enjoyed writting this and hope
