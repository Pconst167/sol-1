
                          It's a Ad, Ad, Ad, Ad World

     The average American consumer is bombarded with hundreds of commercial
messages a day, and some experts claim that the average child sees and hears
100, 000 pitches before being old enough to attend school.  Sometimes it seems
that, in these messages, both the sponsors and the advertising agencies have
abandoned the struggfle to communicate clearly, washing their hands of sense
and meaning.

     On a paper placemat in a Massachusetts restaurang appeared this
advertising atrocity:

                            NEWBURY STREET COIFFURE
                                   AFFORDABLE
                        An Alternative to Looking Good.

     After tittering and scratching our heads for a while, we can reconstruct
what happened lin the framing of this cacphonous come-on.  Apparently, the
good folks at Newbury Street Coiffure meant to proclaim that their affordable
prices afforded an alternative for looking good.  But what came out was the
message, "Come to us and we'll throw gunk on your hair and pull some of it
out.  And we'll charge you very little to do it!"

     As the following classified classics will demonstrate, there are often
more laughs on the advertising and classified pages than you can find in the
