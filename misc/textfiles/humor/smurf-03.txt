    You can kill smurfs in many ways, like using a gun, but as I said in the
previous file, but it would be useless. So I have complied yet another list of
smurf traps to use on the smurfs. If you don't have a smurf license then print
out the new one at the end of this file. If you already have the one from
Volume
I then you must print out this new one. The smurf wardens now know what a fake
one looks like. The new one is as close as possible to a real one and most
wardens will never know the difference.

    Here are some of my newer traps for the use of catching smurfs. I also
have
a good suggestion for you to try, if you have a good cat which brings home all
of it catchings then just show your cat some smurfs and leave the cat alone to
have some fun. Then the next morning you will wake up to find many smurfs at
your doorstep. But there is one drawback, the cat may ruin the smurf and cause
it to be useless for any purpose.

    Now this one works good, but it sometimes doesn't always leave good,
useable
smurf bodies behind. How this one works is that you dig a small hole in a
smurf
campsite. The tired smurfs will come across this in the late evening and see
that campfires have built here before (****=campfire). You have gas, and oil
in
the pit below. You put a thin piece of wood, not to thin, (----=wood) under
the
rooks of the campfire, you cover the wood up with ashes so the smurfs won't
notice it. Now the smurfs light a fire and go to sleep. Well we all know that
wood burns, so when it finally is all burned up the fire will fall to the
liquid
(oil and gas) below and wich will cause an explosion. But take care not to
make
a too big of an explosion, for it might just destroy the smurf bodies.



                                                              * * * * * *

  *=Smurf Berry Patch

     The center of this trap is filled with glue. The smurfs see that they
need
to cross to get to their smurf berry patch and they attempt to cross. But the
glue slowly dries and hardens. You need to get this trap set up just a little
before the smurfs come or it won't work. Then all you do is take the slab of
dried glue home and let it soak in water. You need to use a type of glue that
isn't water proof for this to work. When the glue is all gone you will have
the
smurfs that are perfect to use in some of the new recepies.



                         The Flower Trap

   By now the need for a smurfette is real high. No one yet has come up with a
trap that will catch one. So I complied one that will work one a smurfette.
Simply take a flower and some fly paper. Now put the fly paper all over the
flower and spray some perfume onto it so that a smurfette will go to it to
smell
the aroma. She will take a snif and will be stuck on the fly paper. But you
MUST
be around for when this happens, for she will scream and other smurfs will
attempt to find her and help her. So you have other traps around. Then take
the
smurfette and leave. The smurfs will look for her and get caught in some of
your
other traps.
