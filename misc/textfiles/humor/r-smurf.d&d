Subject: Smurf Class

    I realize that some of you might FLAME me BIG-TIME for posting this but I
    couldn't resist.
 
 
                               THE SMURFS
                               ----------
 
    Smurfs are about 3 inches tall.  Their base AC is -5 because they are so
 small.
    If a hit is scored then the smurf must roll under his/her dex to dodge the
    blow.  If a blow is scored it is devestating to the smurf causing triple
    damage.  Because of their size smurfs cannot use any weapons or armor.
 
    Smurfs are magical creatures.  All spells used by them are the same strength
    as a normal magic user. All Smurfs are magic users and cannot be a member of
    any other class.
 
    NOTE: The Supreme Smurf (Papa Smurf) has healing abilities, however, he is
 not
    considered a cleric because Smurfs worship no dieties.

    SPELLS
    ------
 
    Smurfs may cast any spell (according to it's level) it wants 1/level/day.
    Since they are magical creatures they do not need a spell book.  All smurfs
    are born with the ability to cast any spell, however they must train under
    the Supreme Smurf (Papa Smurf) just as a normal mage would do.
 
    RESTRICTIONS
    ------------
 
    Smurfs are of good alignment, if a smerf commits an evil act he will lose
    his magic ability and be cast out from the smurf society until he has
    corected the damage caused by his evil act.
 
    SPECIAL DEFENSES
    ----------------
 
    Smurfs are immune to all forms of magical attacks.
 
 
    OTHER
    -----
 
    Smurfs are very optimistic.  They are for the most part very happy
 creatures.
    Someone once said that," Smurfs look at life through smurf colored glasses."
    Smurfs also have the constant habit of singing the same tune over and over.
    This causes any Human to have to roll under his Con. to avoid being
 irratated.
