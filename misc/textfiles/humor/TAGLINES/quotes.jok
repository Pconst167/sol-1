OK, I guess it's time for me to post my quotes list again.  As usual
(well, kind of -- I've only posted them once before), I will post them
in random order, without attributions, so you can have fun figuring out
where they came from.  In about a week, I'll post the original file,
with the attributes in comments.  I'll also post the wimpy program I
use that reads my .fortunes file.

I have two criteria for my quotes: a) it must be public (ie I don't
include quotes my friend Joe Shmoe said.  People who have tastes very
similar to mine conceivably could recognize all of these quotes) and b)
it must have made me laugh out loud.  This explains why my list is
relatively short (currently, there are 159 entries).

I will happily take corrections to the wording of the quotes, but,
please, no suggestions for additional quotes.  Somehow, this list is
very personal, and if I don't spot the quote myself, I probably won't
include it.  Oh, plaudits, compliments, and the like are welcome -- in
fact they are required.

gentlemen, someone who I've always personally admired, perhaps
more deeply, more strongly, more ... abjectly than other performer.
A man, well, more than a man, a god!  A great god, whose personality
is so totally and utterly wonderful, that my feeble words of welcome
sound wretchedly and pathetically inadequate.  Someone whose boots I
would gladly lick clean, until holes wore through my tongue!  A man
who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed
in a pit of my own filth than dare tread on the same stage with him!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!"
