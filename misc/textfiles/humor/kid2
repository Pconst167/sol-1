       First of all, my granddaughter calls me Big Maw.  When she was 3
   years old, I had taking her to the store with me.  After we got out 
   of the car, she started to run to the store and I grabed her and 
   pointed down on the blacktop a oily spot about the size of a half 
   dollar.  I told her that if she gets out in front of a car that she
   would like like that spot on the blacktop.
       A month later, she went to the store with me again.  When we got 
   out of the car, she got all excited and started yelling, "Big Maw,
   Big Maw!"  I said, "What is it, Jesica."  She then pointed down to
   a oily spot about 2 times the size of a basketball and ask, "What is 
   that, a mommy or a daddy?"
