As promised, here is my fortune cookie file.  (I posted the cookie program
yesterday.)  It is in six parts.  Collect the parts, strip off the junk,
'cat' them together into the 'sayings' file then run 'cookhash' over them
to generate the hash file, as in "cookhash <sayings >sahash"  After that,
move them to target locations defined in cookie.h and do a 'cookie' to get
a cookie.

----------- cut here, don't forget to strip junk at the end, too -------------

In the beginning I was made.  I didn't ask to me made.  No one consulted

The tar pit of software engineering will continue to be sticky for a long time
to come.  One can expect the human race to continue attempting systems just
within or just beyond our reach; and software systems are perhaps the most
intricate and complex of man's handiworks.  The management of this complex
craft will demand our best use of new languages and systems, our best
adaptation of proven engineering management methods, liberal doses of common
sense, and ... humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.

All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts
those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.  Perhaps the hundreds
of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end
goal.  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger,
and the young are always optimists.  But however the selection process works,
the result is indisputable:  "This time it will surely run," or "I just found
the last bug."

"My own life has been spent chronicling the rise and fall of 
human systems, and I am convinced that we are terribly 
vulnerable.... We should be reluctant to turn back upon the 
frontier of this epoch. Space is indifferent to what we 
do; it has no feeling, no design, no interest in whether 
or not we grapple with it. But we cannot be indifferent to 
space, because the grand, slow march of intelligence has brought 
us, in our generation, to a point from which we can explore and 
understand and utilize it. To turn back now would be to deny 
our history, our capabilities."

"What does it take for Americans to do great things; to go 
to the moon, to win wars, to dig canals linking oceans, to 
build railroads across a continent? In independent thought 
about this question, Neil Armstrong and I concluded that it 
takes a coincidence of four conditions, or in Neil's view, 
the simultaneous peaking of four of the many cycles of American 
life. First, a base of technology must exist from which to do 
the thing to be done. Second, a period of national uneasiness 
about America's place in the scheme of human activities must 
exist. Third, some catalytic event must occur that focuses 
the national attention upon the direction to proceed. Finally, 
an articulate and wise leader must sense these first three 
conditions and put forth with words and action the great thing 
to be accomplished. The motivation of young Americans to do what 
needs to be done flows from such a coincidence of conditions.... 
The Thomas Jeffersons, The Teddy Roosevelts, The John Kennedys 
appear. We must begin to create the tools of leadership which 
they, and thier young frontiersmen, will require to lead us 
onward and upward."
