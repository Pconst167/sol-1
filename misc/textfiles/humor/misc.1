... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a
programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting
down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That
behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and
never when standing.

Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal
know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,
know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to
hypothesize: was there a loose with under the carpet, or problems with static
electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible. 
An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:
the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a
touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led
astray by hunting and pecking.

				Kick the Mongrel

	In a previous account I told how reading a book on cryptography led
to my getting an F.B.I. record at the age of 12 and about subsequent
awkwardness in obtaining a security clearance.  By request I will now describe
how I learned that putting provocative information on a security clearance
form can accelerate the clearance process.  First let me describe the
environment that gave rise to this gambit.

			   White Faces in New Places

	In 1963, after living in Lexington, Massachusetts for 8 years, I moved
to the Washington D.C. area to help set up a new office for Mitre Corporation. 
After three days of searching, my wife and I bought a house then under
construction in a pleasant suburb near Fairfax, Virginia.  I hadn't noticed 
t during our search, but it soon became evident that there were nothing but
white faces in this area.  In fact, there were nothing but white faces for
miles around.
	We expected to find some cultural differences and did.  For example,
people drove much less aggressive than in Boston.  The first time that I did
a Boston-style fake-out at a traffic circle, the other cars yielded!  This
took all the fun out of it and I was embarrassed into driving more conservatively.
	When I applied for a Virginia driver's license, I noticed that the
second question on the application, just after "Name," was "Race."  When filling
out forms, I have always made it a practice to omit information that I think
is irrelevant.  It seemed to me that my race had nothing to do with driving a
car, so I left it blank.
	When I handed the application to the clerk along with the fee, he just
looked at me, marked "W" in the blank field and threw it on a stack.  I guess
that he had learned that this was the easiest way to deal with outlanders.
	Our contractor was a bit slow in finishing the house.  We knew that
there was mail headed our way that was probably accumulating in the post
office, so we put up the mailbox even before the house was finished.  The
first day we got just two letters -- from the American Civil Liberties Union
and Martin Luther King's organization.  We figured that this was the Post
Office staff's way of letting us know that they were on to us.  Sure enough,
the next day we got the rest of our accumulated mail, a large stack.
	It shortly became apparent that on all forms in Virginia, the second
question was "Race."  Someone informed me that as far as the Commonwealth
of Virginia was concerned, there were just two races: "white" and "colored." 
When our kids brought forms home from school, I started putting a "C" after
the second question, leaving it to the authorities to figure out whether
that meant "Colored" or "Caucasian."

				Racing Clearance

	About this time, my boss and I and another colleague applied for a
special security clearance that we needed.  There are certain clearances
that can't be named in public -- it was one of those.  I had held an ordinary
Top Secret clearance for a number of years and had held the un-namable 
learance a short time before, so I did not anticipate any problems.
	When I filled out the security form, I noticed that question #5 was
"Race."  In the past I had not paid attention to this question; I had always
thoughtlessly written "Caucasian."  Having been sensitized by my new environment,
I re-examined the question.
	All of my known forebears came from Europe, mostly from Southern
Germany with a few from England, Ireland, and Scotland.  A glance in the
mirror, however, indicated that there was Middle Eastern blood in my veins. 
I have a semitic nose and skin that tans so easily that I am often darker
than many people who pass for black.  Did I inherit this from a Hebrew, an
Arab, a Gypsy or perhaps one of the Turks who periodically pillaged Central
Europe?  Maybe it was from a Blackfoot Indian that an imaginative aunt thinks
was in our family tree.  I will probably never know.
	As an arrogant young computer scientist, I believed that if there is
any decision that you can't figure out how to program, the question is wrong. 
I couldn't figure out how to program racial classification, so I concluded
that there isn't such a thing.  I subsequently reviewed some scientific
literature that confirmed this belief.  "Race" is, at best, a fuzzy concept
about typical physical properties of certain populations.  At worst, of course,
it is used to justify more contemptible behavior than any concept other
than religion.
	In answer to the race question on the security form, I decided to
put "mongrel."  This seemed like an appropriate answer to a meaningless question.
	Shortly after I handed in the form, I received a call from a secretary
in the security office of the Defense Communications Agency.  She said that
she had noticed a typographical error in the fifth question where it said
"mongrel."  She asked if I didn't mean "Mongol."  "No thanks," I said,
"I really meant `mongrel.'"  She ended the conversation rather quickly.
	A few hours later I received a call from the chief security officer
of D.C.A., who I happened to know.  "Hey, Les," he said in a friendly way,
"I'd like to talk to you the next time you're over here."  I agreed to meet
him the following week.
	When I got there, he tried to talk me out of answering the race
question "incorrectly."  I asked him what he thought was the right answer. 
"You know, Caucasian," he replied.  "Oh, you mean someone from the Caucusus
Mountains of the U.S.S.R.?" I asked pointedly.  "No, you know, `white.'" 
"Actually, I don't know," I said.
	We got into a lengthy discussion in which he informed me that as
far as the Defense Department was concerned there were just five races:
Caucasian, Negro, Oriental, American Indian, and something else that I
don't remember.  I asked him how he would classify someone who was, by
his definition, 7/8 Caucasian and 1/8 Negro.  He said he wasn't sure. 
I asked how he classified Egyptians and Ethiopians.  He wasn't sure.
	I said that I wasn't sure either and that "mongrel" seemed like
the best answer for me.  He finally agreed to forward my form to the
security authorities but warned that I was asking for trouble.

			A Question of Stability

	I knew what to expect from a security background investigation:
neighbors and former acquaintances let you know it is going on by asking
"What are they trying to get you for?" and kidding you about what they
told the investigators.  Within a week after my application for the new
clearance was submitted, it became apparent that the investigation was
already underway and that the agents were hammering everyone they talked
to about my "mental stability."
	The Personnel Manager where I worked was interviewed quite early
and came to me saying "My God!  They think you're crazy!  What did you do? 
Rape a polo pony?"  He also remarked that they had asked him if he knew me
socially and that he had answered "Yes, we just celebrated Guy Fawkes Day
together."  When the investigator wanted to know "What is Guy Fawkes Day?"
he started to explain the gunpowder plot but thought better of it.  He
settled for the explanation that "It's a British holiday."
	An artist friend named Linda, who lived two houses away from us,
said that she had no trouble answering the investigator's questions about
my stability.  She said that she recalled our party the week before when
we had formed two teams to "Walk the plank."  In this game, participants
take turns walking the length of a 2 x 4 set on edge and drinking a small
amount of beer.  Anyone who steps off is eliminated and the team with the
most total crossings after some number of rounds wins.  Linda said that
she remembered I was the most stable drinker there.
	I was glad that she had not remembered my instability at an earlier
party of hers when I had fallen off a skateboard, broke my watch and bruised
my ribs.  The embarrassing thing was that I had run over the bottom of
my own toga!
	The investigation continued full tilt everywhere I had lived. 
After about three months it stopped and a month later I was suddenly
informed that the clearance had been granted.  The other two people whose
investigations were begun at the same time did not receive their clearances
until another five months later.
	In comparing notes, it appeared that the investigators did the
background checks on my colleagues in a much more leisurely manner.  We
concluded that my application had received priority treatment.  The
investigators had done their best to pin something on me and, having
failed, gave me the clearance.
	The lesson is clear:  If you want a clearance in a hurry, put
something on your history form that will make them suspicious but that
is not damning.  The investigators get so many dull backgrounds to check
that they relish the possibility of actually nailing someone.  By being
a bit provocative, you draw priority attention and quicker service.
	After I received the clearance, I expected no further effects
>From my provocative answer.  As it turned out, there was an unexpected
repercussion a year later and an unexpected victory the year after
that.  But that is another story.
