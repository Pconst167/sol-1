Real Estate Ad's Translated!
============================

The first problem facing a home buyer, 
is money. The second is learning a new 
language;  the language of real estate 
advertisments.

Real estate ad's, of course, never lie.
They are  a form of  poetry  and poetry
does not lie. However, it does not tell
the truth either.   Rather, poetry uses
the language in new  and inventive ways
to convey an image pleasing the reader.

EG:....  Neat  cottage.   Ideal holiday
home  for  first  home owner. Partially
renovated.   Quiet   street,  Excellent
investment oppotunity. Will not last at
this price.  Forced sale.

Does  this  cast  up  images  of rustic
charm?  A  little  solid brick bungalow
surrounded  by trees. Translate this ad
into REAL english, and this is what you
get.....

Small,  old  fibro  home, about to fall
down!.
