            And Flash Gordon was there

            Then something went wrong
            For Fay Wray and King Kong;
            They got caught in a celluloid jam.

Photographer: Let's get a picture.  Close together now.  The folks and
            then the grandparents. Just of the close family.  Ahhh,
            hold that.  Beautiful.  And... (snap)

Ralph:      I guess we finally did it, huh.

Brad:       I don't think there's any doubt about that. You and Betty have
            been almost inseparable since you met in Dr. Scott's refresher
            class.

Ralph:      Well to tell you the truth, Brad, that's the only reason I
            showed up in the first place. (chuckles)

Betty:      O.K. you guys, this is it. (everyone screams)

Ralph:      Well Betty's going to throw the bouquet.  [throw BOUQUET]

Janet:      ["Catch it, Janet!"] I got it!  I got it!

Ralph:      Hey big fella, looks like it could be your turn next, eh?

Brad:       Who knows. ["The Shadow knows!"]

Ralph:      Well, so long, see you Brad.  Guess we better get get going now Bett
            Come on, hop in.  (they drive away)

Janet:      Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful?  Wasn't Betty radiantly beautiful?
            I can't believe it.  An hour ago she was just plain old Betty Monroe
            and now...
            ["Now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapshatt!"] now she's Mrs. Ralph Hapshatt.
            ["I'd rather be Betty Monroe!"]

Brad:       Yes Janet, Ralph is a lucky guy.

Janet:      Yes.

Dentonian:  I always cry at weddings.  ["So do I!" or "What the fuck do you do at
            funerals, bitch?!"]

Brad:       Everyone knows that Betty is a wonderful little cook.
            ["Yes, and she's a great little fuck, too!"]

Janet:      Yes.

Brad:       Why Ralph himself, he'll be up for a promotion in a year or two.

Brad:       I've got something to say.

Janet:      Uh huh.

            ["Say it, Brad!"]
Brad:       I really love the... ["Starts with an S..."] skillful way... you beat
            the other girls... ["With whips and chains?"] to the bride's bouquet.

            The future is ours so let's plan it. (Janet)
            So please, don't tell me to can it. (Janet)
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you.

            The road was long but I ran it. (Janet)
            There's a fire in my heart and you fan it. (Janet)
            If there's one fool for you then I am it. (Janet)
            I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet I love you.

            Here's a ring to prove that I'm no joker.
            There's three ways that love can grow.
            That's good, bad, or mediocre.
            Oh, J-A-N-E-T I love you so.

Janet:      Oh, it's nicer than Betty Monroe had. (Oh Brad)
            Now we're engaged and I'm so glad (Oh Brad)
            That you met Mom and you know Dad. (Oh Brad)
            I've one thing to say and that's Brad, I'm mad, for you too.

            Oh Brad...

Brad:       Oh... dammit.

Janet:      I'm mad...

Brad:       Oh, Janet.

Janet:      For you.

Brad:       I love you too.

Brad & Janet: There's one thing left to do - ah - oo.

Brad:       And that's go see the man who began it. (Janet)
            When we met in his science exam - it (Janet)
            Made me give you the eye and then panic. (Janet)

Brad & Janet: I love you.

Narrator:   I would like, ah, if I may, ["You may!"] ...to take you on a
            strange journey.  It seemed a fairly ordinary night when Brad Majors
            his fiancee Janet Weiss, two young, normal, healthy kids, left Denton
            that late November evening, to visit a Dr. Everett Scott, ex-tutor,
            now friend to both of them.  It's true there were dark storm clouds.
            ["Adjectives, please!" or "Describe your balls!"]
            heavy, black, and pendulous, towards which they were driving.
            It's true, also, that the spare tire they were carrying
            was badly in need of some air, but, uh, they being normal kids, on a
            night out... well, they weren't going to let a storm spoil the rest
            their evening, were they?  ["What kind of night was it?"] ...On a night
            out... ["WHAT kind of night?"] it was a night out they were going to
            remember... ["How long?"] for a very long time.

Janet:      Gosh, that's the third motorcycle that's passed us.
            They sure do take their lives in their hands, what with the
            weather and all.

            ["Say something stupid, Brad(Asshole)!"]
Brad:       Yes, life's pretty cheap to that type. ["Asshole!"]

Janet:      Oh. ...What's the matter, Brad darling?

Brad:       We must have taken the wrong fork a few miles back. ["You took the
            salad fork!"]

Janet:      Oh, but where did that motorcyclist come from?

Brad:       Hmmm... well I guess we'll just have to turn back.
                    ["Don't back up!"]  (BOOM)

Janet:      Oh! What was that bang?

Brad:       We must have a blowout.  DAMMIT! ["Janet!"] I knew I should have
            gotten that spare tire fixed. ["Asshole!"]  Well, you just stay here
            keep warm and I'll go for help.

Janet:      But where will you go in the middle of nowhere?

Brad:       ["Try the castle!"] ...Didn't we pass a castle back down the road
            a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone we could use.
            ["Castles don't have telephones, asshole!"]

Janet:      I'm going with you.

Brad:       Oh, no, darling, there's no sense in both of us getting wet.

Janet:      I'm coming with you!  Besides darling, the owner of that phone
            might be a beautiful woman, ["He is!"] and you might never come back

Brad:       Heh, heh, heh, heh.

            OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE

Janet:      In the velvet darkness,
            Of the blackest night,
            Burning bright, there's a guiding star.
            No matter what or who you are.

Brad & Janet: There's a light... [light MATCHES on 'light']

Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place.

Brad & Janet: There's a light...

Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace...

            [MATCHES out on 'darkness' - "Darkness!" if any lights still on]
Brad & Janet: There's a light, light in the darkness of everybody's life.

            ["Sing it, Riff (Raff)!"]
Riff Raff:  The darkness must go down the river of night's dreaming.
            Flow morphia slow, let the sun and light come streaming
            Into my life.  Into my life...

Brad & Janet: There's a light...  [MATCHES again]

Chorus:     Over at the Frankenstein place.

Brad & Janet: There's a light...

Chorus:     Burning in the fireplace.
            There's a light, a light

Brad & Janet: [off at 'Darkness'] ...in the darkness of everybody's life.

            (in the stage version right after the first chorus Brad has this extra
            verse:

Brad:       I can see the flag fly
            I can see the rain
            Just the same, there has got to be
            Something better here for you and me.

            (repeat chorus))

Narrator:   And so, it seemed that fortune had smiled on Brad and Janet and
            that they had found the assistance that their plight required.
            ["Or had they?"] ...Or had they?

Janet:      Brad, let's go back, I'm cold and frightened...

Brad:       Just a moment Janet, they might have a phone.
            (doorbell rings, door creaks open)

Riff Raff:  Hello. ["Hello"]

Brad:       Hi! My name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.
            I wonder if you could help us.  You see, our car broke down
            a few miles up the road... do you have a phone we might use?

Riff Raff:  You're wet. ["No shit, Sherlock!"]

Janet:      Yes - it's raining. ["No shit, Janet!"]

Brad:       Yes.

Riff Raff:  Yes... I think perhaps you better both come inside.
            ["Better than coming outside!"]
Janet:      ["How kind is he?"] You're too kind. ["No, he's not"]
            Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of a place is this?

Brad:       Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

Janet:      Oh (forlornly)

Riff Raff:  ["Which way?"] This way.

Janet:      Are you having a party?

            ["What kind of night is it?"]

Riff Raff:  You've arrived on a very special night.  It's one of the
            master's affairs.

            THE TIME WARP

Riff Raff:  It's astounding;
            Time is fleeting;
            Madness takes its toll.
            But listen closely...

Magenta:    Not for very much longer.

Riff Raff:  I've got to keep control.
            I remember doing the time-warp
            Drinking those moments when
            The darkness would hit me

            He thought you were the candyman.

            Don't get strung out by the way I look.
            Don't judge a book by its cover.
            I'm not much of a man by the light of day
            But by night I'm one hell of a lover.  ["Throw it!"]

            I'm just a sweet transvestite
            From Transexual, Transylvania.

            Let me show you around
            Maybe play you a sound.
            You look like you're both pretty groovy.
            Or if you want something visual
            That's not too abysmal,
            We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

Brad:       I'm glad we caught you at home,
            Could we use your phone?
            We're both in a bit of a hurry.

Janet:      [echo 'Right'] Right.

Brad:       We'll just say where we are,
            Then go back to the car.
            We don't want to be any worry.

Frank:      Well you got with a flat, well, [echo] how 'bout that?
            Well, babies, don't you panic.
            By the light of the night it'll all seem alright.
            I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

            I'm just a sweet transvestite
            From Transexual, Transylvania.

            Why don't you stay for the night?

Riff Raff:  [echo] Night.

Frank:      Or maybe a bite?

Columbia:   [echo] Bite.

Frank:      I could show you my favourite obsession. ["Sex!"]
            I've been making a man ["Not him!"]
            With blond hair and a tan
            And he's good for relieving my... ["Erection!"] ...tension

Frank:      So - come up to the lab,
            And see what's on the slab.
            I see you shiver with antici - (3 seconds) ["SAY IT!"] - pation.
            But maybe the rain
            Isn't really to blame.
            So I'll remove the cause. (chuckles) ["What about the symptom?"]
            But not the symptom.

            (applause) (Brad and Janet are given towels and both say thank you)

            (Columbia and Riff Raff start to undress Brad and Janet)

Janet:      Oh!  Brad!

Brad:       It's all right Janet.  We'll play along for now and pull
            out the aces when the time is right. ["Aces!"]

Columbia:   Slowly, slowly! It's too nice a job to rush.

Brad:       Hi, my name is Brad Majors, and this is my fiancee,
            Janet Weiss; you are...

Columbia:   You're very lucky to be invited up to Frank's laboratory.
            Some people would give their right arm for the priviledge. ["Take mine!"]

Brad:       People like you maybe.

Columbia:   Ha! I've seen it.

            (Riff Raff pours wine into a glass, takes a swig from the bottle, an
            lets it drop after Columbia says "Shift it" ["Drop it!"])

Riff Raff:  Come along - the master doesn't like to be kept waiting.

Columbia:   Shift it.

            (Janet screeches - the elevator goes up)

Janet:      Is he your husband?

Riff Raff:  The master is not yet married, nor do I expect he ever
            shall be. We are simply his servants.

Janet:      Oh.

Janet:      Weiss.

Brad:       Weiss? um

Frank:      ["Say something in French"] Enchante.

            (Janet giggles)

Frank:      Well! how nice.  And what charming underclothes you both have.
            But here.  Put these (smocks) on.  They'll make you feel less ["Horny"]
            vulnerable.  It's not often we receive visitors here, let alone offer
            them... hospitality.

            ["Get tough, Brad!"]
Brad:       Hospitality!?  All we asked was to use your telephone,
            Goddammit, a reasonable request which you've chosen to ignore.

Janet:      Brad, don't be ungrateful.

Brad:       Ungrateful! [when Brad removes his glasses, "It's Superman!"]

Frank:      How forceful you are, Brad.  Such a perfect specimen of manhood.
            So... dominant (crowd has flurry of laughs).  You must be awfully pr
            of him, Janet.

Janet:      ["Lie, Janet"] Well, yes I am. (giggles)

Frank:      Do you have any tattoos, Brad?

Brad:       Certainly not!

Frank:      ["Ask Janet"] Oh well, how about you. (to Janet)

Janet:      No. (giggling)

Riff Raff:  Everything is in readiness, master.  We merely await your

Frank:      Tonight, my unconventional conventionalists... you are about to

            break... whole pieces start to fit into place, not a sign of being..
            what a fool! The answer was there all the time, it took a small accident
            to make it happen... ["An accident?"] AN ACCIDENT

Magenta & Columbia: An accident!

Frank:      And that's how I discovered the secret, that elusive ingredient,
            that SPARK that is the breath of life... ["Do you have that knowledge?"]
            Yes, I have that knowledge... ["Do you know the secret?"] I know the

            THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES

Rocky:      The sword of Damocles is hanging over my head,
            And I've got the feeling someone's gonna be cutting the thread.
            Oh, woe is me, my life is a misery.
            Oh, can't you see, that I'm at the start of a pretty big downer.

            I woke up this morning with a start when I fell out of bed.

All:        That ain't no crime.

Rocky:      And left from my dreaming was a feeling of unnameable dread.

All:        That ain't no crime.

Rocky:      My high is low, I'm dressed up with no place to go.
            And all I know is I'm at the start of a pretty big downer.

All:        Sha-la-la-la that ain't no crime.

            The sweat from his pores as he works for his cause
            Will make him glisten ...and gleam.
            And with massage, and just a little bit of steam, ["Go for it!"]
            He'll be pink and quite clean
            He'll be a strong man.  Oh honey...

            When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright?
            It don't seem the same since cosmic light
            Came into my life, I thought I was divine.
            I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go,
            And listen to the music on the radio;
            A saxophone was playing in a rock 'n roll show.
            You climbed in the back seat, you really had a good time.

            Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll.
            Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll.

            Hot patootie, bless my soul, I really love that rock 'n roll.

            My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled.
            My hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt.
            I'd taste her baby pink lipstick and that's when I'd melt
            And she'd whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine.
            Get back in front, put some hair oil on
            Buddy Holly was singing his very last song.
            With your arms around your girl you'd try to sing along.

Narrator:   There are those that say that life is an illusion, and that
            reality is but a figment of the imagination.  If this is so,
            then Brad and Janet are quite safe, ... however, the sudden departure
            of their host...and his creation...into the seclusion of his somber
            bridal suite had left them feeling both ["Horny!"] apprehensive and
            a feeling which grew as the other guests departed, and they were
            shown to their separate rooms.

Frank:      Yes, yes I know, but it isn't all bad, is it?  I think you really
            found it quite pleasurable.

Janet:      Oh, stop...I mean help...Brad Brad!..Oh Brad!!

Frank:      Shhh. Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you

Frank:      Oh come on, Brad, admit it, you liked it, didn't you?  It isn't
            a crime to give yourself over to pleasure, Brad. ["Not in this state!"]

            it all better.

Narrator:   Emotion, agitation or disturbance of the mind...Vehement or excited
            mental state.  It is also a powerful and irrational master...and from

Janet:      I was feeling done in, couldn't win

Columbia:   You mean she...

Magenta:    Uh huh ["Virgin!"]

Janet:      I thought there's no use getting
            Into heavy petting
            It only leads to trouble
            And seat wetting.

Brad:       I told you, my car broke down.  I was telling the truth.

Frank:      I know what you told me...but this Dr. Everett Scott, his name

Dr. Scott:  Brad! What are you doing here?

Frank:      Don't play games, Dr. Scott.  You know perfectly well what
            Brad Majors is doing here.  It was part of your plan, was it not?
            That he and his female should check the layout for you.  well,
            unfortunately for you, all your plans are to be changed.  You must
            be adaptable, Dr. Scott; I know Brad is.

Dr. Scott:  I can assure you that Brad's presence here comes as a complete
            surprise to me.  I came here to find Eddy.

Brad:       Eddy!  I've seen him!

Frank:      Eddy!  What do you know of Eddy, Dr. Scott?

Frank:      On the day I went away...

All:        Goodbye...

Frank:      Was all I had to say...

All:        Now I...

Frank:      I want to come again, and stay.

All:        Oh, my, my...

Frank:      Smile, and that will mean I may.
            'cause I've seen, oh, blue skies
            Through the tears in my eyes
            And I realize, I'm going home.

All:        I'm going home.

Frank:      Everywhere it's been the same...

All:        ...feeling...

Frank:      ...like I'm outside in the rain...

All:        ...wheeling...

Frank:      ...free to try and find a game...

All:        ...dealing...

Frank & All: I'm going home. (3 times)

Magenta:    How sentimental. ["Insensitive bitch!"]

Riff Raff:  And also presumptuous of you.  You see, when I said WE were
            to return to Transylvania, I referred only to Magenta and myself.
            I'm sorry, however, if you found my words misleading, but you see,
            you are to remain here, in spirit, anyway.

Scott:      Great heavens!  That's a laser!

Riff Raff:  Yes, Dr. Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure
            anti-matter. ["Then it's not a laser!"]

Brad:       You mean...you're going to kill him?  What's his crime?

Scott:      You saw what became of Eddy.  Society must be protected.

Riff Raff:  Exactly, Dr. Scott.  And now, Frank N Furter, your time has
            come.  Say goodbye to all of this, ["Goodbye, all of this"] and hello to
            oblivion. ["Hello, oblivion"]

Janet:      Oh!  You killed them!

Magenta:    But I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

            ["Get paranoid!"]
Riff Raff:  They didn't like me!  He never liked ME!

Scott:      You did right. ["SHOOT HIM!!!" etc. ]

Riff Raff:  A decision had to be made.

Scott:      You're O.K. by me.

Riff Raff:  Dr. Scott, I'm sorry about your nephew.

Scott:      Eddy? ["No, Blanche!"]
            Yes, well, perhaps it was all for the best, heh, heh, heh.

Riff:       You should leave now, Dr. Scott, while it is still possible.
            We are about to beam the entire house to the planet Transexual, in the
            galaxy of Transylvania.  Go... ["When?"] Now.

            Our mission is completed, my most beautiful sister, and soon we shall
            return to {the moon-drenched shores of our beloved planet}.

            To find the truth.  I've even lied.

All:        I'm bleeding...

Janet:      And super heroes come to the feast
