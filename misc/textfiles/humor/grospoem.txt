INTRODUCTION



        Ever since I was a wee tyke, I've been fascinated by our

culture's so-called nursery rhymes.  Where did these strange,

familiar and adorable little poems come from?  Have they always

been an integral part of the Western childhood experience?  Our

research (partially funded through a generous National Endowment

for the Arts grant) has revealed some startling answers to these

fundamental questions.  In the course of our explorations through the

ancient, dusty libraries of Europe, we discovered that nursery

rhymes actually started out as ribald drinking songs.  Over the

centuries, henpecked husbands reluctantly altered these "songs" for

their children, at the request of their wives, who invariably felt the

original songs were a little to much for innocent ears.  (An example:

"Mother Goose" was originally an action, not a person.)  Thus, with

appropriate warning given, we here present to you some of our

favorite nursery rhymes in their original form.

  

  

                              Eeny Meeny Miney Moe,

                            Catch a tiger by his toe.

                                When he eats you,

                                Then you'll know,

                       That you're stupid and you're slow.

  

                           Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater,

                      Beat his wife and wouldn't feed her.

                           Put her in a pumpkin shell,

                        And when he died he went to hell.

  

                             Mary had an extra limb,

                          Its fleece was white as snow.

                         And everywhere that Mary went,

                          People thought it was a lamb.

  

                          Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,

                                I pushed him down

                              And watched him fall.

                             All the King's horses,

                             And all the King's men,

                               Rode by and slipped

                                 on his albumen.

  

                          Jack and Gil went up the hill

                            To take a poke at Walter.

                                 Jack went down

                                on Walter's Crown

                               and Gill came too,

                                   Soon after.

  

                                 Jack be nimble,

                                 Jack be quick.

                            Jack butchered his family

                              And moved to Canada.

  

                                  Simple Simon

                                 Broke my hymen

                               Going to the Fair.

                                I said, "Simon,"

                              "That's my pie, man!"

                         "I ain't got a slice to spare!"

  

                               Little Jack Horner

                                Sat in a corner,

                         A knife in his sister's thigh.

                             He said to the coroner,

                            "Though I am a mourner,"

                           "If you're not to eat her,"

                                    "May I?"

  

                                Wee Willy Winkle

                             Ran through the night.

                            But I finally caught him

                               And did him right.

                            He screamed and squirmed

                               And put up a fight.

                              I soon found out why,

                            'Cause boy, was he tight!

  

                               Little Miss Muffet

                               Sat on her tuffet,

                         Her legs wide open and splayed.

                            When down came a spider,

                            Who crawled up inside her

                        And tickled miss Muffet all day.

  

                             There was an old lady,

                              Who lived in my shoe.

                                When I put it on

                              She turned into goo.

  

                             Hickory, Dickory, Dock.

                          Rammed a mouse on to my cock.

                                 Without a sound

                               I turned it around,

                          And watched it go into shock.

  

                                   Jack Sprat

                                   Ate a cat.

                                 He shat a rat.

                               And that was that.

  

                               Old Mother Hubbard

                           Was found in her cupboard,

                                 Her flesh eaten

                              Through to the bone.

                              When they discovered

                               Old Father Hubbard

                             'Said, "Bitch wouldn't"

                                "Leave me alone."

  

                               Hey Diddle Diddle,

                               My penis is little

                                  and shriveled

                            and shrunk like a prune.

                           But if you will squeeze it

                          And tease it, and please it,

                             It'll blow up just like

                                   A balloon.

  

                                 Georgie Porgie,

                                Glasses and Cups,

                              Kissed the Girls and

                                Knocked them up,

                               When their parents

                             found out what they did

                            They got out a coathanger

                              and tore out the kid.

  

                               The Queen of Hearts

                               She made some Tarts

                           with refried beans one day

                                 I ate the tarts

                                and got the Farts

                           The Queen, she moved away.

  

                                 Rock-A-Bye Baby

                                On the tree top,

                                 I threw a rock,

                             and the cradle dropped,

                             The little head broke,

                              and all I could see,

                               was a new meaning,

                            to the word "infant-tree"

  

                                  Rub A Dub-Dub

                               Three men in a tub,

                         and what do you think they be?

                           The Butch, and the 'bucker,

                             The Candlestick Fucker,

                      Turns out they're faggots- all three.

  

                           Larry Larry Quite the Fairy

                           What makes your penis grow?

                     whatever sells, like cocks and smells,

                          and little boys all in a row.

  

                          Twinkle Twinkle little knife,

                          Adept you are at taking life,

                        I love the glitter as you slash,

                          people who are carrying cash.

  

                       Old King Cole had a ten foot Pole,

                          and his ten foot Pole had me,

                              Although he was tall,

                              We still had a ball,

                      and he went back to Warsaw for free.

  

                               A diller, A dollar,

                             A ten o'clock scholar,

                          What makes you come so soon?

                        You used to come at ten o'clock,

                            And now you come at noon.

          (this nursery rhyme has remained unchanged through the years)

  

                           Four and Twenty Blackbirds

                                 Baked in a pie

                             pull out their feathers

                               and watch them die.

                      It is such sport to hear them scream

                               I reach in my pants

                               and begin to cream.

  

                             There were two fratboys

                               Sitting on a hill,

                               The one named Jack

                              The other named Bill.

                              Drink all day, Jack,

                              Drink all day, Bill.

                                 Fall down Jack,

                                Fall down, Bill.

  

AND FINALLY, A RECENTLY UNCOVERED EPIC FABLE FROM SCOTLAND

  

                      There once was a man named McDowell,

                        Whose dog had very tight bowels,

                               He freed it a bit,

                         with his tongue and some spit,

                      And he needed to use lots of towels.

  

                     The mutt was soon shitting a crateful.

                    When the pastor came by, he was hateful.

                              "This is truly a sin

                             But I have to give in,

                     If you loosen me up- I'd be grateful."

  

                       The pastor said, "I have not shat."

                       McDowell said, "We'll see to that."

                        Though he thought he might fail,

                               He saw a pink tail,

                        And out popped a yellow-eyed rat!

  

                        "Alas," said the rat, "I am torn,

                       from the place in which I was born.

                             I am out on the street,

                              with nothing to eat.

                         Away from my peanuts and corn."

  

                         "Mr. Rat your fortune is made,"

                   said the pastor who knelt down and prayed.

                            The Lord heard his words,

                           And filled him with turds,

                      So he bent himself over and sprayed.

  

                           The rat dug into his pile,

                           The dog left after awhile.

                            The Pastor, he squealed,

                             when McDowell kneeled,

                    but his "blessing" sure left a big smile!
