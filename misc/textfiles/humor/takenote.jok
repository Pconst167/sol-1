  WHEN PROFESSOR MITCHELL SAYS:        YOU WRITE:
 
    "Probably the greatest quality
  of the poetry of John Milton, who
  was born in 1608, is the combination
  of beauty and power.  Few have        John Milton--born 1608
  excelled him in the use of the
  English language, or for that
  matter, in lucidity of verse form,
  'Paradise Lost' being said to be
  the greatest single poem ever
  written."
 
 
    "When Lafayette first came to
  this country, he discovered
  America.  The Americans needed his    Lafayette discovered America
  help if their cause was to survive,
  and this he promptly supplied them."
 
 
    "Current historians have come to    Most of the problems that now face
  doubt the complete advantageousness   the United States are directly
  of some of Roosevelt's policies"      traceable to the bungling and greed
                                        of President Roosevelt.
 
 
    "...it is possible that we do       Professor Mitchell is a communist
  not understand the Russian
  viewpoint..."
 
 
    "The puissance of hydrochloric
  acid is incontestable; however,       Hydrochloric acid eats the hell
  the corrosive residue is              out of steel
  inharmonious with metallic
  persistance."
