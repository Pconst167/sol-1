
                     In the Beginning there was The Plan

                        And then came the Assumptions

                    And the Assumptions were without Form

                And the Plan was completely without Substance

              And The Darkness was upon the face of The Workers

                   And they Spake among Themselves, Saying,

                  "It is a Crock of Shit, And it Stinkith."

           And The Workers went unto their Supervisors and Sayeth,

         "It is a Pail of Dung and none may Abide the Odor Thereof."

      And the Supervisors went unto their Managers and Sayeth unto them,

            "It is a Container of Excrement and It is very strong,

                       Such that None may Abide by It."

            And the Managers went unto their Directors and Sayeth,

       "It is a Vessel of Fertilizer, and None may Abide Its Strength."

      And the Directors spoke amongst Themselves, Saying One to Another,

      "It contains That Which Aids Plant Growth, and It is Very Strong."

    And the Directors went unto the Vice Presidents and Sayeth unto Them,

                  "It promotes Growth and is Very Powerful."

     And the Vice Presidents went unto the President and Sayeth unto Him,

    "This New Plan will actively promote the Growth and Efficiency of This 

                   Company, and These Areas in Particular."

                    And The President looked upon The Plan

            And Saw that It Was Good.  And The Plan Became Policy.



                          This is how Shit Happens.
