   Here is a way to rip off the
coke machines you see out side of stores and other places!
ok first on all vending machines
there are always those rouund almost unpickable locks
when no one is looking take a peice
of air hardening clayy (make sure it is only air hardening!)
and press it into the lock real good!
then remove the clay carefully and put it somewhere to dry!
make sure the clay is TOTALY dry
then go back in a day or so
and you will have a key to fit that lock
put the key in and push and turn
and presto the machine will open
allowing you to take all the money!
a good machine will get you between
2100 and 300 dollars depending when
it was last checked by the company.
and best of all if someone sees
you just put the key on the ground
and step on it and its powder!
and then you cant be busted because
the evidence is blown away!
More?  
so that's it and if anyone has any good schemes, write a file on them
 and add to the phringe phile collection.

bye for now.
