Hey, I never claimed it was brilliant.  I know it's stupid.  It's SUPPOSED
to be stupid.  The whole idea of .signatures is STUPID!  We never used them
in the old days when ARPANET was getting started and netnews hadn't been
invented.  That's because back then, just using the reply command worked
about 99% of the time.  Then uucp came along with its non-compliant, header-
munging, message-dropping, and generally brain-dead mailers.  It's been
downhill ever since.

The first time I went to work for a place with uucp connections but no
direct Internet access, I held off on using a .signature for a long time.
But eventually, some bozo followed up to one of my postings in a technical
group, saying "I tried to e-mail this to Jeff Postkanser, but it didn't
work."  Sigh.

So .signatures are a necessary evil.  But we should never forget that they
*are* evil.  My stupid quotes are my way of reminding people of this.  Of
course, as another of my stupid quotes said, "Most people on this network
wouldn't recognize subtlety if it hit them on the head."

Anyway, at least I do the net the courtesy of changing my stupid quote every
time I post.  With most people, you see the same stupid quote or graphic
over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.
I've appended a list of stupid .signatures currently appearing in soc.singles,
sorted by number of appearances.  If this kind of shit bores and disgusts
you as much as it does me, please join me in expressing disapproval.
