For forty years physicists have been trying to get controlled nuclear fusion.
They've been taking poor little nuclei of heavy hydrogen-- we call 'em
"deuterons"-- and crashing them together with brute force. Just a little while
ago the news came out of Utah that you could do fusion in a pickle jar, without
a lot of expensive equipment.  If this turns out to be true, it could be as
important to energy production as good old Enrico Fermi's first reactor in the
University of Chicago squash courts, way back when.

I was working in the Fusion Lab late one night
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
But I couldn't get my magnetic bottle to light
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Yeah, it was late at night
Yeah, it wouldn't light
Yeah, she was a Fusion Girl
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron

Then I met a chemist who was kinda pretty
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
She told me that she came from Salt Lake City
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Yeah, she was kinda pretty
Yeah, she came from Salt Lake City
Yeah, she was a Fusion Girl
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron

She said, "You're wasting your time, and you're bound to lose"
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
"Let me introduce you to a new way to fuse"
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Yeah, you're bound to lose
Yeah, a new way to fuse
Yeah, she was a Fusion Girl
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron

What Fermi did under a stadium
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
She did with heavy water and palladium
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Yeah, he had a stadium
Yeah, she had palladium
Yeah, she was a Fusion Girl
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron

We made it together and it was so sweet
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Just a few neutrons and a whole lotta heat
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
Yeah, it was so sweet
Yeah, a lotta heat
Yeah, she was a Fusion Girl
Da deuteron, ron, ron, da deuteron ron
