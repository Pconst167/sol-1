
                           RULES FOR BEING HUMAN

   1. You will receive a body. You may like it or hate  it, but it will be
      yours for the entire period this time around.

   2. You  will learn lessons.  You are enrolled  in a full-time  informal
      school called life.  Each day  in  this  school  you  will  have the
      opportunity to learn lessons. You may like the lessons or think them
      irrelevant and stupid.

   3. There  are no mistakes, only  lessons. Growth is a  process of trial
      and error, experimentation.  The  "failed" experiments are as much a
      part of the process as the experiment that ultimately "works".

   4. A  lesson is repeated until  learned. A lesson will  be presented to
      you  in  various  forms  until you have learned it.  When  you  have
      learned it you can go on to the next lesson.

   5. Learning  lessons does not end.  There is no part  of life that does
      not contain its lessons.  If you are  alive, there are lessons to be
      learned.

   6. "There"  is no better  than "here." When  your "there" has  become a
      "here" you will simply obtain another "there" that will, again, look
      better than "here".

   7. Others are merely mirrors of  you. You cannot love or hate something
      about another person unless it reflects to you something you love or
      hate about yourself.

   8. What you make of your life is  up to you. You have all the tools and
      resources you need. What you do with them is up to  you.  The choice
      is yours.

   9. Your  answers lie inside  you. The answers  to life's questions  lie
      inside you. All you need to do is look, listen, and trust.

   10. You will forget all this...
