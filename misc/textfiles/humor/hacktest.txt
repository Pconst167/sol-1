
THE HACKER TEST - Version 1.0
 
Preface:  06.16.89
 
This test was conceived and written by Felix Lee, John Hayes and Angela
Thomas at the end of the spring semester, 1989.  It has gone through
many revisions prior to this initial release, and will undoubtedly go
through many more.
 
 
(Herewith a compendium of fact and folklore about computer hackerdom,
cunningly disguised as a test.)
 
 
Scoring - Count 1 for each item that you have done, or each
question that you can answer correctly.
 
 
If you score is between:                    You are
 
0x000 and 0x010       ->         Computer Illiterate
0x011 and 0x040       ->         a User
0x041 and 0x080       ->         an Operator
0x081 and 0x0C0       ->         a Nerd
0x0C1 and 0x100       ->         a Hacker
0x101 and 0x180       ->         a Guru
0x181 and 0x200       ->         a Wizard
 
Note: If you don't understand the scoring, stop here.
