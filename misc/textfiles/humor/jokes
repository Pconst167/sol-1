   A group of scientists discovered an apelike creature in the wilds which
they were certain was the Missing Link.  The proof of their theory, though,
required that a human mate with the ape in order to see what characteristics
the progeny would take on.  So they put an ad in the paper:
"$5000 to Mate with Ape."
   The next morning a Pole called up in response to the ad and said he'd be 
willing to be part of the experiment. "But," he said, "I have three conditions."
   The scientist agreed to hear him out.
   "First: My wife must never know.
   "Second: The children must be raised as Catholics.
   "Third: If I can pay in installments, I'm definitely interested."

Mystery of the Trinity?"

shining, you've got all you could want to eat, all the instruments you
might want to play - you're supposed to be blissfully happy!  What's wrong?"
  "Well," said the old man, "you see, I was a carpenter on earth, and lost
my only, dearly beloved son at an early age.  And here in heaven I was hoping
more than anything to find him."

  The newlyweds had never slept together and were most eager to consummate
their union.  The bride in her eagerness insisted on undressing the groom,
but stopped dead upon removing his shoes and socks, finding his toes
grossly misshapen.
  "Not to worry," the groom explained.  "A case of toelio when I was a child."
  The bride proceeded apace, only to stop again with an expression of shock
on her face once she had taken off his pants.
  "Nothing but a childhood case of kneesles," he reassured her.
  "Down to the basics, she reached for his jockey shorts.  "I know, I know,"
she interrupted before her husband could say a word, "nothing but a case
of smallcox."

  A man came into a bar, sat down at the bar for a drink, and noticed that
there was a horse in the back of the room with a big pot of money in front
of it.  "What's that all about?" he asked the bartender.
  "You gotta put a dollar in the pot," explained the bartender, "and you
collect the pot if you can make the horse laugh."
  The guy went over to the horse, whispered in its ear, and the horse cracked
up, fell over, and rolled on the floor in laughter.  And the fellow picked
up the pot and walked out.
 Five years later the same guy walked into the same bar and saw the same horse
at the back with another big pot of money in front of it.  "It's not so easy,"
said the bartender.  "This time you gotta make the horse cry."
  The guy walked over to the horse, and in a matter of minutes the horse fell
to its knees, sobbing as though its heart were breaking.  The guy picked up
the pot and was on his way out the door when the bartender stopped him.
  "Hey," he said, "at least tell us how you did it."
  "Easy," said the guy.  "The first time I told him my prick was bigger than
his, and the second time I showed him."

  A black couple took their young son for his first visit to the circus, and
by chance their seats were next to the elephant pen.  When his father got 
up to buy some popcorn, the boy piped up.  "Mom, what's that long thing on
the elephant?"
  "That's the elephant's trunk, dear," she replied.
  "No, not that."
  "Oh, that's the elephant's tail."
  "No, Mom.  Down underneath!"
  His mother blushed and said, "Oh, that's nothing."  Pretty soon the father
returned, and mother went off to get a soda.  As soon as she had left, the 
boy repeated his question.
  "That's the elephant's trunk, son."
  "Dad, I know what an elephant's trunk is.  The thing at the other end."
  "Oh, that's the elephant's tail."
  "No. Down there!"
  The father took a good look and explained, "That's the elephant's penis."
  "Dad, how come when I asked Mom, she said it was nothing?"
  The man took a deep breath and replied, "Son, I've spoiled that woman."

  This young man decided that, physically, he wasn't adequately endowed.
Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he went to a doctor and 
announced his desire to have his penis surgically enlarged.
  The doctor checked things out and told the young man that the only real
improvement that could be surgically worked was to implant a section of a
baby elephant's trunk.
  Rather a radical solution, agreed the patient, but he was adamant.  The
operation was performed without any complications, and after a few weeks of 
recuperation the young man decided it was time to try out his new
accoutrement.
  He asked a lovely young woman of his acquaintance out to dinner at an 
elegant restaurant.  They were having a quiet conversation when his new
organ, which had been comfortably resting in his left pants leg, whipped out
over the table, grabbed a hard roll, and just as speedily disappeared from
sight.
  "Wow!" said the girl, truly impressed.  "Can you do that again?"
  "Sure," said the fellow, "but I don't know if my asshole can stand another
hard roll."

  A guy comes into a bar and the first thing he sees in the middle of the
room is an enormous alligator.  He spins around and is hustling out the door
when the bartender says, "Hey, hold it!  Come on back in; this alligator's
tame.  Look, I'll show you."
  He comes out from behind the bar, tells the alligator to open its mouth,
unzips his pants and whips it out, and stands there with his pecker in the
alligator's mouth for a full fifteen minutes.
  "Pretty amazing, huh?" he says, turning around and zipping himself up.
"You wanna give it a try?"
  "Gee, I don't think so," says the first man.  "I don't think I could keep
my mouth open for fifteen minutes."

  A guy comes into a bar with a frog and sets it down next to the prettiest 
girl there.  "This is a very special frog," he informs her.  "His name is
Charlie."
  "What's so special about this frog?" she asks.  He's reluctant to tell her,
but when pressed, explains that, "This frog can eat pussy."
  The girl slaps him, knocking him off his chair, and accuses him of telling
her a filthy lie.  But no, he assures her, it's completely true.  And after
much discussion, she agrees to come back to his apartment to see the frog
in action.  She positions herself appropriately, the guy takes out the frog,
and says, "Okay, Charlie, do your stuff!"
  The frog is immobile, despite his owner's exhortations, and the girl starts
to snicker.
  "Okay, Charlie," says the guy, moving the frog out of the way, "I'm only 
going to show you one more time."

  This blind fellow walked into Macy's with his seeing-eye dog and headed 
straight for the men's department.  Surrounded by pajamas and neckties, he 
proceeded to come to a stop, pick up his German Shepard by the hind legs, 
and swing the dog around and around in a circle.
  A startled clerk ran over to him, saying loudly, "Sir...may I help you
with anything?"
  "No thanks," said the blind man, "just looking."
