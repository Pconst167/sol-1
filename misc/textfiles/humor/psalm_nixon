Subject:  President Nixon
	  Psalm of Nixon


Nixon is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He leadeth me beside the still factories.
He restoreth my doubt in the republican party.
He guideth me to the path of unemployment for the party's sake.
I do not fear evil for thou art against me.
Thou annointest my wages with freezes,
So that my expenses runneth over my income.
Surely poverty and hard living shall follow the Republican party.
And I shall live in a rented house forever.



5,000 years ago Moses said, "Park your camel, pick up your shovel,
mount your ass, and I shall lead you to the promised land."

5,000 years later Roosevelt said, "Lay down your shovel,
sit on your ass, light up your Camel; this is the promised land."

Today Nixon will tax your shovel, sell your camel, kick your ass,
and tell you there is no promised land.



P.S. I'm glad that I am an American.
     I'm glad that I am free.
     But I wish I was a puppy,
     And Nixon was a tree.
