COBOL, ASSEMBELER, JCL,
THOSE IBM GUYS BELONG IN HELL.

TO THE COMPILER, MY JOB I DID SEND,
ONLY TO GET A SOC-7 ABEND.

BURIED SOMEWHERE IN MILES OF CODE,
A TINY BUG HAS MADE HIS HOME.

AND SINCE MY MODULES AREN'T BLACK BOXES,
I KICK AND SCREAM, BECOME OBNOXIOUS.

"YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER, MR. DLITCH!"
A TRACE SHOULD NAIL THAT SON OF A BITCH.

OR, PERHAPS A DUMMY DUMP,
IS WHAT I NEED TO FIND THE CHUMP.

BUT READING THAT WOULD BE NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE,
FORGOT, I CAN'T SPEAK HEXADECIMAL.

THIS PROGRAM'S DUE IN TWENTY MINUTES,
AT THIS RATE I'LL NEVER FINISH.

DEADLINES APROACHING MUCH TOO FAST...
I KNOW - I'LL BLAME A SYSTEMS CRASH!
