        The following exerpt has been taken directly from the book "1984" by
George Owell. It describes parts of speech that can be directly used with words
in the preceding dictionary.

     "...The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities. The first
of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts
of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very
abstract words such as "if" or "when") could be used either as verb, noun,
adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the
same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the
destruction of many archaic forms. The word thought, for example, did not exist
in Newspeak. Its place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and
verb. No etymological principle was involved here; in some cases it was the
original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb. Even
where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one
or other of them was frequently suppressed. There was, for example, no such
word as cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb "knife."
Adjectives were formed by adding the suffix "-ful" to the noun-verb, and
adverbs by adding "-wise." Thus, for example, "speedful" meant "rapid" and
speedwise meant "quickly." Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good,
strong, big, black, soft, were retained, but their total number was very small.
There was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be
arrived at by adding "-ful" to a noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs
was retained, except for a very few already ending in "-wise;" the -"wise"
termination was invariable. The word "well," for example, was replaced by
"goodwise."
        In addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word
in the language--could be negatived by adding the the affix "un-", or could be
strengthened by the affix "plus-", or for still greater emphasis "doubleplus-."
Thus, for example, uncold meant warm, while pluscold and doublepluscold meant,
respectively, very cold and superlatively cold. It was also possible, as in
present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional
affixes such as "ante-," "post-," "up-," "down-," etc. By such methods it was
found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary. Given, for
instance, the word "good" there was no need for such a word as "bad," since the
required meaning was equally well--indeed, better--expressed by "ungood." All
that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of
opposites was to decide which of them to suppress. "Dark" for example, could be
replaced by "unlight," or "light" by "undark," according to preference.
        The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar was its regularity.
Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below, all inflections followed
the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were
the same and ended in "-ed." The preterite of steal was throughout the
language, all such forms as "swam," "gave," "brought," "spoke," "taken," etc.,
being abolished. All plurals were made by adding "-s" or "-es" as the case
might be. The plurals of "man," "ox," "life" were "mans," "oxes, "lifes."
Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding "-er," "-est," (good,
gooder, goodest), irregular forms and the "more," "most" formation being
suppressed.
        The only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect
irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and
the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that
"whom" had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the "shall," "should" tenses had
been dropped, all their uses being covered by "will" and "would." There were
also certain irregularities in word formation arising out of the need for rapid
and easy speech. A word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be
incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally
therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or
an archaic formation was retained. But this need made itself felt chiefly in
connection with the B vocabulary. Why so great an importance was attached to
ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.


        This was an excerpt of the book "1984" by George Orwell it is in the
appendix of the book, entitled "The Principles of Newspeak." This is part of
the explanation of the "A" vocabulary of Newspeak.
