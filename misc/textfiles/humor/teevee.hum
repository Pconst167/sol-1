     For years we've known that television signals from Earth were leaking
into space, ready to be intercepted be other intelligent civilizations.  But
some experts have suggested the reverse is also true.  Television broadcasts
from other civilizations could be heading our way.

     For that reason, a few scientists here on Earth have been using
powerful television antennas to scan the heavens for broadcast signals that
would confirm the existence of intelligent, televised life elsewhere in the
cosmos.

     Recently scientists at a remote listening station in Arizona received
signals that gave Earthlings their first look at television from outer
space.  After logging a month's worth of viewing, one researcher turned his
notes over to reporters, with the warning, "If you think our TV is bad, take
a look at what they're watching."  His book showed the following:
