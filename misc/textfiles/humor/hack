Internal Memo # 125/JC››RE : EXCESSIVE ABSENCE


TO ALL PERSONELL.

Due to the excessive of absences during the past year it has
become necessary to put the following new rules into operation
immediately.


1. SICKNESS

No excuse. The Management will no longer accept your Doctor's
Certificate as proof. We believe that if you are able to go to
your doctor you are able to attend work.


2. DEATH (YOUR OWN)

This will be accepted as an excuse. We would like two week's
notice however since we feel it is your duty to train someone
else for your job.


3. DEATH (OTHER THAN YOUR OWN)   

This is no excuse. There is nothing you can do for them and
henceforth no time will be allowed off for funerals. However, in
case it should cause some hardship to some of our employees
please note that on your behalf the Management has a special
scheme in conjunction with the local Council for lunchtime
burials, thus ensuring that no time is lost from work.


4  LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR AN OPERATION

We wish to discourage any thoughts you may have of needing an
operation and henceforth no leave of absence will be granted for
hospital visits. The management believes that as long as you are
an employee here you will need what you already have and should
not consider having any of it removed.  We engaged you for your
particular job with all your parts and having anything removed
would mean that we would be getting less of you that we
bargained for.


5  VISITS TO THE TOILETS.   

Far too much time is spent on the practice. In future the
procedure will be that all personal shall go in alphabetical
order. For example:- those with the surname being 'A' will go
from 9.30 to 9.45 'B' will go from 9.45-10.00. Those of you who
are unable to attend at your appropriate time will have to wait
until the next day when your turn comes up.
