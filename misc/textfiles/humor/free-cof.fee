			The Coffee Manifesto

What's Coffee?  Its a popular, brown liquid stimulant.

I have set up a coffee pot in my cubicle for people who enjoy coffee,
and want more quality and variety than the corporate-sponsored coffee
service provides.  Several other volunteers are helping me.
Contributions of time, money, coffee and equipment are greatly 
needed.

So far we have a Proctor-Silex 10 cup coffee pot, and about five
different types of coffee, some sugar cubes, some non-dairy creamer
and 2500 plastic stirrers.  We hope to supply, eventually, everything
useful that normally comes with a Coffee system, and more.


How Coffee Will Be Available

Coffee is not in the public domain.  Everyone will be permitted to
make and drink coffee, but no one will be allowed to restrict its
further redistribution.  That is to say, proprietary coffee will not
be allowed.  I want to make sure that all coffee brewed remains free.


Why Many Other Coffee Drinkers Want to Help

I have found many other Coffee drinkers who are excited about the Free
Coffee Foundation and want to help.

Many coffee drinkers are unhappy about the in house coffee system.
It may enable them to drink more coffee, but it requires them to
drink the same type of coffee every day.


How You Can Contribute

I am asking coffee drinkers for donations of machines, coffee,
supplies and money.

One consequence you can expect if you donate coffee is that you will
be able to drink it during the work day.  The coffee machines should
be complete, ready to use systems, approved for use in a residential
area, and not in need of sophisticated cooling or power.


Why All Coffee Drinkers Will Benefit

Once coffee is made, everyone will be able to obtain good coffee.

The complete coffee system will be available to everyone.  As a
result, a coffee drinker who wants a different brand of coffee will
always be free to make it himself.  Coffee drinkers will no longer
be at the mercy of one company which owns the coffee machine and is in
sole position sell us their coffee.

Finally, the overhead of considering who owns the coffee system and what
one is or is not entitled to do with it will be lifted.

Arrangements to make people pay for coffee always incur a tremendous
cost to society through the cumbersome mechanisms necessary to figure
out how much a person must pay for.  And only a police state can force
everyone to obey them.  Consider a space station where air must be
manufactured at great cost: charging each breather per liter of air
may be fair, but wearing the metered gas mask all day and all night is
intolerable even if everyone can afford to pay the air bill.  And the
TV cameras everywhere to see if you ever take the mask off are
outrageous.  It's better to support the air plant with a head tax and
chuck the masks.

Drinking coffee is as natural as breathing, and as productive.  It
ought to be as free.



In the long run, the FCF is a step toward the post-scarcity world,
where nobody will have to work very hard just to be able to drink
coffee.  People will be free to devote themselves to activities that
are fun, such as programming, after spending the necessary ten hours a
week on required tasks such as legislation, family counseling, robot
repair and asteroid prospecting.

We have already greatly reduced the amount of work that the whole
society must do for its actual productivity, but only a little of this
has translated itself into leisure for workers because much
nonproductive activity is required to accompany productive activity.
The main causes of this are bureaucracy and isometric struggles
against competition.  Free coffee will greatly reduce these
drains in the area of coffee services.  We must do this,
in order for technical gains in productivity to translate into
less work and better coffee for us.
