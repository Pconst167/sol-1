19)
   Right - now there was this man who had just got married and was spending
   his wedding night with his new wife in a very posh hotel.  It was to be
   the first time that he had ever had sex with his partner, indeed he had
   never seen her with no clothes on.  As they were both undressing, he
   looked up from taking his socks off to notice that she did in fact have
   completely huge breasts.  He said as much to her, but the poor girl who
   had always had a bit of a complex about them got very distraught at this.
   So much so that she sent him with a blanket to go and sleep in the
   corridor.

   The man was pretty upset at this, but not wishing to fuel her anger
   further, did as he was told.  Just as he was getting off to sleep
   another man came into the corridor to join him.  The first man asked
   the second why he was out there, to which he replied that he was also
   on his wedding night and had never had the pleasure of seeing his new
   wife's body before either.  When she was undressing, he had suddenly
   exclaimed out loud what an absolutely enormous bum she had got.  She
   hadn't really been very impressed with this outburst, and had ordered
   him to go and sleep in the corridor.

   It wasn't long before jilted honeymooner number three sulkily sauntered
   along to join the other two.  "What's wrong with you?" asked the
   first, "did you put your foot in it as well?"

   "No," replied the third, "but I bloddy well could have done"

20) What do you call three people in wheelchairs on top of each other?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

21) It was a cold, dark, winters night (aren't they all), and there was this
woman driving home through the countryside, when suddenly she had a blow out
and she had to stop the car. Since it was late and she didn't relish the thought
of changing the wheel, she walked to a nearby farmhouse to ask if she could stay
the night and phone a garage in the morning to fix the car. The farmer agreed to
let her stay in his house as long as she did not mind the farmers' two sons
attittude. The farmer explained that his wife had died when the boys were young
and due to the farms isolation, the two, who were now young men, had never seen
a woman at close quarters before.
  So the woman goes to bed..... and then, halfway through the night, she starts
to feel quite randy, and decides to pay one of the lads a 'visit'. Now, being
a careful and sensible woman she gives him a condom to wear, telling him it will
prevent her from getting pregnant. After they make-love she goes back to bed.
 Unfortunately, soon afterwards, she gets 'the urge' again, and goes to see the
other son. Once again giving him a condom to wear, they make-love.
 The next morning she thanks the farmer for his hospitality and phones the
garage and goes on her way.
 ...Three months later the two sons are working in the fields together, and they
discuss their experience with the woman. The youngest son asks the eldest son,
"Do you realy care if that woman gets pregnant?"
"No, not at all." replies the eldest.
"Well why don't we take off these damn rubber things, then?"

22)
			FUCK
                        ****

Perhaps one of the most interesting words in the Englisch language
today is the word FUCK. It is one magical word! Just by it's sound
you can discribe pain, displeasure, love and hate.
In language FUCK falls into many grammatical categories, it can be
used as a verb both intransactive (Dave fucked Anne) and transitive
(Dave was fucked by Anne). As an adverb (Anne is a good fuck) and
also as an adjective (Anne is fucking beautiful). As you can see
there are not many words with the versatility of "fuck".
Beside the sexual meaning of of the word, there are also the
following:

	Goodbye                 Fuck Off.
	Greetings               How the Fuck are you?
	Fraud                   I got Fucked at the car auction.
	Dismay                  Oh Fuck it.
	Trouble                 Well, I guess I'm Fucked now.
	Aggression              Fuck you!
	Difficulty              I don't understand the Fucking job.
	Displeasure             What the Fuck is going on here?
	Incompetence            He Fucks up everything.
	Lost                    Where the Fuck are we?
	Relation                Up your Fucking arse.

And remember General Custers famous last words:
	...."Where did all those Fucking Indians come from?"

The very last words of the Mayor of Hiroshima:
	...."What the Fuck was that?"

And last but not least, those immortal words of the captain of the Titanic:
	...."Where the is all this Fucking water comming from?"

26) Paddy heard that a fortune could be made by working as a lumberjack in
    Canada.

So, off he goes. After some weeks, he arrives at a lumberjack-camp
and asks the foreman for a job.

Foreman: "Okay sonny, but you'll have to do a test first. If you can
chop down 100 trees tomorrow you're hired".

So, next day, Paddy gets his chainsaw and happily saws away all day.
When trees are counted Paddy only has 98.....
"Oh well" says the foreman, "You'll get another chance tomorrow"

So, next day, same story, 99 trees.

"I don't believe this" says the foreman, "A big strong fella like
yourself should be able to cut down 200 trees in a day. You know what?
You get one more chance, and I'll join you to show you the trick of it".

So, next day, Paddy and the foreman go into the forest. Upon arrival
at a nice open spot the foreman puts the chainsaw on the ground,
and starts the engine.

Says Paddy: "Holy Jezus! Where's the noise coming from?"

   The Pope is on his 1988 tour of America, in the middle of his 3 day bash in
   New York.  On the second day, he is driving back to his motel after a heavy
   days bible bashing.  It suddenly occurs to him that he is a little peckish
   and so he decides to go for something to eat.  Out of the corner of his eye
   he notices 'Mel's Diner' and immediately pulls over.  He hops out, kisses
   the ground a couple of times and then goes in and sits down.
   A sleazy waitress wanders over, notices who he is and then straightens
   herself up.
    "Yes you Holiness, what would you like?"
   The Pope thought for a while.
    "Well daughter, I have this terrible craving for a nice steak."
    "Sure Mac, er I mean of course your Holiness.  Would you like it well done,
   medium or rare?"
    "Oh.  I think I'd like a very rare one please."
   The waitress raised her arm.
    "One bloody steak, Mel!" she shouted.
   The Pope was horrified.
    "Oh no my daughter, you musn't swear.  There is no call for it!"
    "But you don't understand, father, bloody describes how you will get the
   steak.  Very rare."
    The Pope smiled.
    "I understand.  How stupid of me."
   A little later, the Pope's steak arrived and he got stuck in.  It was
   gorgeous and he went to bed that night feeling satiated.

   The next day, the Pope had had an even bigger God-squading session and was
   helped by 31 of his cardinals.  Afterwards, he called his cardinals together.

    "Right Lads, as you've done a really good job today, I'll treat you to a
  bit of nosh at this place I know.  You'll like it I'm sure".

    So the Pope took his cardinals to the diner and sat down.  He called to the waitress.

    "Can I have 32 bloody steaks please!"

    Immediately one of the cardinals slapped his knee...

    "Hey yeah! And plenty of fucking chips okay ? "

    The car suddenly grinds to a halt on a lonely country road. The driver
tries to restart it but to no avail. So he gets out and opens the bonnet and
starts fiddling with the plugs. Suddenly he hears a voice. "The left hand
carburettor is blocked, why don't you drain it and the muck should come out
too". He turns round and can see no one, so he shrugs and goes back to what he
was doing.
    "Drain the muck out of the left hand carburettor", says the voice again,
and when he turns round all he can see is a black horse with its head over the
hedge looking at him. Again the voice tells him what to do and he suddenly
realises that the horse is giving him instructions. Too shocked to argue, he
does as he is told, starts the car and sure enough it works. He drives down to
the nearest pub and, rushing in like a madman, has a stiff drink. Then he says
to the barman, "My car broke down up there and a horse told me how to repair
it".
    The barman looks at him and says, "Was it a black one?"
    "Yes."
    "Good, the white one knows nothing about cars."
