        TO:      All Users
        SUBJECT: SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING


In order to assure that we continue to produce the highest
quality work possible, it will be our policy to keep all users
well trained through our program of Special High Intensity
Training (S.H.I.T.).  We give our users more S.H.I.T. than any
other BBS nationwide.

If you feel you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the
job, please see your SYSOP. You will be placed on top of the
S.H.I.T. list for special attention. All of our SYSOPs are
particularly qualified to see that you get all the S.H.I.T. you
can handle.

If you are unable to keep pace, we will put you into the Double
Endeavour Executive Program, Special High Intensity Training
                            (D.E.E.P.S.H.I.T.).

If you consider yourself already sufficiently trained, you may
be interested in helping  us train others. We can add to our
Basic Understanding Lecture List, Special High Intensity
Training                    (B.U.L.L.S.H.I.T.).
                            
Further questions should be addressed to:
   Head of Training, Special High Intensity Training 
                            (H.O.T.S.H.I.T.).
   Thank You.
   
   Boss in General, Special High Intensity Training 
                            (B.I.G.S.H.I.T.).
