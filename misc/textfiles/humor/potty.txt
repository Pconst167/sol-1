컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 
     Ever since  man  crawled  out  of the  primordial ooze,  he has built
     himself structures to contain  the processes of bodily waste removal.
     These  have  been  known as  "restrooms,"  "bathrooms,"  "outhouses,"
     "commodes,"  "men's rooms,"  and several  other names.   As  with any
     exclusive  organization,  wholly half  the human race  aren't allowed
     through the door,  and  a number of  exceedingly complicated  customs
     have arisen to maintain a sense of order and dignity.

GENERAL RULES:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     [1]  Don't talk  to somebody  you don't know.   You may  chat quietly
          with an acquaintance,  but must absolutely not call attention to
          yourself.
 
     [2]  A quick  glance  in the mirror  is  permissible,  but absolutely
          don't spend a  significant time  arranging hair,  clothing, etc.
          Zit-popping is  only  permissible  after  checking to see nobody
          else is around.
 
     [3]  No profanity  of  any kind.   This is reserved for locker rooms,
          only.
 
     [4]  If you must wait, form a  single-file line,  ragged, and be sure
          to keep looking around.  Read grafitti.
 

GRAFITTI RULES:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     [1]  All grafitti is anonymous.   If there's  any chance somebody can
          trace your grafitti back to you, don't do it.
 
     [2]  Writing  grafitti  in the open section  of the bathroom  is only
          acceptable if  nobody  can see you.   Writing  in the stalls  is
          similarly acceptable.
 
     [3]  If the  bathroom  is  sufficiently public,  feel free  to insult
          different ethnic/racial/sexual groups.   If the bathroom is used
          by  a small few,  restrain  comments  to  amusing  anecdotes  or
          chit-chat about secretaries.  If visiting dignitaries from other
          companies  or  the  government  may  tend  to  use the bathroom,
          grafitti is forbidden.
 
     [4]  Traditionally,  all pictures feature women  in various states of
          undress.   Modern  standards  often  include  portions  of  male
          anatomy, discretely placed.   Homosexual  grafitti  is generally
          frowned upon but is gaining popularity.
 
     [5]  Pictures must only be drawn in toilet stalls.
 
     [6]  Any sufficiently  interesting graffiti  will be painted over  by
          the management of the bathroom.
 

URINAL RULES:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     [1]  Given a string of unoccupied urinals, you must choose one on the
          outside.   When  one outside urinal  is occupied,  use the other
          side, then middle.   Avoid standing directly next to somebody at
          all costs.
 
     For example, given seven urinals, here are acceptable configurations:

          X......    ["X" = Occupied / "." = Not Occupied]
          X.....X
          X..X..X
          X.X.X.X       _
          XXX.X.X ]    /  These are only acceptable when significant
          XXX.XXX ] <-<   "privacy" dividers are available.  If the
          XXXXXXX ]    \_ urinals aren't divided, use a toilet.

     [2]  Always look at the wall.   Looking down means you're obsessed or
          don't  know  what  you are  doing.   Looking  at other people is
          threatening.
 
     [3]  Flushing is optional.   Over time,  the water will become a rich
          orange.  At this point, flushing is mandatory.
 
     [4]  Don't start unzipping  until you're protected  by the privacy of
          the urinal.   Don't step back  until  you've  closed  your pants
          again.


TOILET RULES:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     [1]  Reduce noise at all costs.  Grunting is not acceptable.
 
     [2]  Always flush.
 
     [3]  When  you  find  an  unflushed toilet,  leave  it alone  and use
          another.
 

SPECIAL CASES:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
     [1]  Some university dormitories have co-ed bathrooms.  New rules apply
          for dealing with the females.
   
              [A]  Never EVER comment on how they look in the morning.
              [B]  Don't ask what the little wastebasket is for.
              [C]  If  urinals  are  present,   only  use  them  when
                   absolutely  no  females  are  around.   If you are
                   noticed  by a female,  try your best to ignore her
                   presense until you're dressed again.
 
     [2]  Port-O-Let's and similar constructions are evil.   Use them only
          if absolutely no other option is available.
 
     [3]  In the woods, far from civilization,  restrooms typically aren't
          available.  Get behind sufficient growth that you are completely
          invisible  to the remainder  of your party,  before  you  begin.
          Check  carefully  that you  aren't near  any  sort of animal  or
          insect den.   Ants are  especially  bad.   If you  forgot toilet
          paper,  bring a leaf identifying guide.  Poison oak makes a poor
          substitute.
