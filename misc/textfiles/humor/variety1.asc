                         FARMINGTON, MICHIGAN  48041



  Perhaps you have heard of me and my nationwide campaign in the crusade  
  of temperance. Each year, for the past fourteen, I have made a tour of
  Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and California.
  I have delivered a series of lectures on the evils of drinking. In this
  tour, I have been accompanied by my young assistant, Warren Butterworth.
  Warren, a young man of good family and excellent background is a
  pathetic example of life ruined by excessive indulgence in whiskey and
  women.

  Warren would appear with me at the lectures and sit on the platform
  wheezing and staring at the audience through bleary, bloodshot eyes,
  sweating profusely, picking his nose, passing gas and making obscene
  gestures at the audience setting an example of what over indulgence
  can do to a person.

  Last fall, unfortunately, Warren died. Shortly our crusade will be
  travelling in your area. A mutual friend has given me your name and
  address. I wonder if you would be able to take Warren's place on my
  annual tour.

  I will call when I get to your locale.

                                        Yours in Faith,

               HOW MANY LAWYERS DOES IT TO CHANGE A LIGHT BULB?


   A. Whereas the party of the first part, also known as "Lawyer", and the
party of the second part, also known as "Light Bulb", do hereby and forthwith
agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (Light Bulb) shall
be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform
previously agreed upon duties, i.e., the lighting, elucidation, and otherwise
illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the
entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area,
demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at
the option of the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and not required by
the aforementioned agreement between the parties.
    The aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited
to, the following steps:
    1.) The party of the first part (Lawyer) shall, with or without elevation
at his option, by means of a chair, stepstool, ladder or any other means of
elevation, grasp the party of the second part (Light Bulb) and rotate the
party of the second part (Light Bulb) in a counter-clockwise direction,this
point being non-negotiable.
   2.) Upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (Light Bulb)
becomes separated from the party of the third part ("Receptacle"), the party
of the first part (Lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of
the second part (Light Bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state,
local and federal statutes.
   3.) Once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first
part (Lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of
the fourth part ("New Light Bulb").  This installation shall occur in a
manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step one of
this self-same document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur
in a clockwise direction, this point also being non-negotiable.
   NOTE: The above described steps may be performed, at the option of the
party of the first part (Lawyer), by any or all persons authorized by him, the
objective being to produce the most possible revenue for the party of the
fifth part, also known as "Partnership."

*  I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

*  A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.

*  A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

*  The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times
   before I hit him.

*  I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law,
   and headed for the embankment.

*  To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front of me, I hit a
   pedestrian

   I had a fractured skull.

   and had the accident.

                 WHY CUCUMBERS ARE BETTER THAN MEN:
        
        The average cucumber is at least six inches long.
        
        A cucumber won't tell you that size doesn't count.
        
        A cucumber never suffers from performance anxiety.
        
        A cucumber will never leave you for another woman.
        
        Cucumbers stay hard for a week.
        
        Cucumbers don't get TOO excited.
        
        Cucumbers are easy to pick up.
        
        It's easy to drop a cucumber.
        
        No matter how old you are, you can always get a fresh cucumber.
        
        With a cucumber, you never have to say you're sorry.
        
        You always know where your cucumber has been.
        
        Cucumbers don't leave you wondering for a month.
        
        You can eat a cucumber when YOU feel like it.
        
        A cucumber doesn't care if you're a virgin.
        
        Cucumbers can stay up all night, and you won't have to
        
        sleep in the wet spot.
        
        Cucumbers don't play the guitar and try to find themselves.
        
        You won't find out later that your cucumber (a) is married,
       
        A cucumber won't care what time of the month it is.
        
        A cucumber never wants to get it on when your nails are wet.
        
        Cucumbers don't say "Let's keep trying until we have a boy".
        
        Cucumbers won't tell you size doesn't count.
        
        A cucumber won't leave you for a cheerleader or an ex-nun.
        
        Cucumbers don't fall asleep on your chest or drool on the pillow.
        
        Cucumbers don't care if you make more money than they do.
        
        With a cucumber, the toilet seat is always the way you left it.

				The word "Fuck"





	 Perhaps one of the most interesting and colorful words in the
	 english language today  is  "fuck."   It  is one magical word
	 which by its sound can describe  pain,  pleasure,  hate,  and
	 love. Fuck is	derived  from the German word "Fricken"  which
	 means "Whoopee."

	 In language "fuck"  falls  into  many grammatical categories.
	 It can be used as a verb - both transitive (John fucked Mary)
	 and intransitive (Mary was fucked  by	John).	It  can  be an
	 active verb (John  really  gives  a fuck) or a  passive  verb
	 (Mary really doesnt  give  a fuck). Use it as an adverb (Mary
	 is fucking intrested in John)	or  a  noun  (Mary  is fucking
	 beautiful). How many words are as versatile as fuck?

	 Besides its sexual connotations, this word  can  be  used  to
	 describe many situations.


	      Fraud	     I	got  fucked  by  the  insurance agent.
