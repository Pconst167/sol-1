     Well I must state my opinion that there are certainly WAY too many
 Overwriting Viruses out here. To help put a Stop to this I will try
 to explain to you a SIMPLE way to infect COM files at the END of the
 Program. This routine WORKS if you follow my steps correctly, and
 I've already used this in my `ParaSite ][' Virus.

 Anyhow this is a brief description what the ASM Source will do.
             1. Find a .COM file in the current Directory
             2. Save the Date and File's Attribute.
             3. Save the First 3 Bytes in a Stack
             4. Infect the File & restore new 3 bytes..
             5. Put the OLD date and File Attributes back on

                          Beginning...
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Anyhow that's it... Simple no? This source was also used in my ParaSite ][
 Virus that is STILL undetectable to date with Scanv85. Anyhow I even made
 it MORE simpler than my real sources that have to play with the file paths.

 Anyhow theres still work to be done, like you must restore the old data file
 so it will jump to 100h and run the old file the virus was infected too!
 Remember to store them in the beginning and then restore them! Anyhow there's
 a few Variables to be put in like `VirLength' which you should know how to
 do that also the `CodeLength' that is the VIRUS codes ONLY not counting the
 Stacks.

 Anyhow This works FINE with a Non-Resident Virus. Because a few statements
 would have to be edited for TSRs. Anyhow try to use this, it's small neat
 and fast.

 Anyhow Perhaps next issue I will develop a SIMPLE Ram-Resident virus that
 infects COMs and EXEs to be released into the next issue! Though I just
 release this sources for you to LEARN! Rather than putting you name on my
 virus and releasing another strain on work I worked Hard upon! Anyhow I
 should release a SIMPLE new Virus source for all you programmers out there!
 And I will even explain a few Stealth Technics like how to hide your program
 in memory right under the TOM.

 If there's Any Questions you want to know, please ask them I will answer
 them in the next [NukE] Releases... I may even release source codes on how
 to make an Algorithm Encryption method! I've developed one on my own,
 without the V2PX viruses sources... Anyhow it does the job and the formula
 I developed has an UNLIMITED amount of encryption methods! But since the
 virus codes have to be SMALL Like close to 2,000 bytes I will limit the
 formula to about 1,000 different combinations!
