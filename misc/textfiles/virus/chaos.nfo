                       Viral Collector's Kit #1

                                  By

                         The Knights of Chaos


                  Released into the world on 02/04/95


This is a Knights of Chaos Original Release. We've compiled this large package
of 270 viruses, virus creating and writing tools, informational text files
and Virus Group Magazines, and brought them together into VCK #1.

We plan on releasing 1000+ viruses total in sequel Viral Collector's Kits.

The Viruses you'll find in this package are documented and BBS ready. What does
that mean? They've been pre file_id.diz'ed with the virus' common name and the
name it can be found under in Patricia Hoffman's Virus Summary (VSUMX 4.1).
Each zip is pre-loaded with a warning disclaimer about the contents, an excerpt
from VSUMX 4.1 about what the virus is and what it does. All you have to do is
put them up on your board if you support virus transfers.

Our main goal is to provide many computer viruses for reverse engineering for
those who are curious about how viruses work. Many virus source code files are
also included.

 What you get in Viral Collector's Kit #1
