AUTOMAXX.ARC          HC  This DOS menu-making program comes with
                         documentation that Marshall Magee, author
                         of the popular AUTOMENU program, contends
                         is plagiarized.  Marshall believes that
                         the AUTOMAXX documentation uses exact
                         phrases from his documentation, and if
                         this is the case, AUTOMAXX is clearly
                         illegal.  However, as I understand it,
                         the courts are currently deliberating on
                         the case, so AUTOMAXX is not currently
                         illegal. of today.  For more information,
                         please contact Marshall Magee at (404)
                         446-6611.

CLIPPER.ARC   186803  MU  This is a Norton Guides module for
CLIP_NG.ARC               the Clipper Dbase Compiler.  Nantucket,
                          the makers of Clipper, forbid
                          distribution.

COPYWRIT        2???  MP  Although the real COPYWRITE is going
                          around Bulletin Boards like fire, there
                          is another illegal file under the same
                          name.  The former takes around 40 KB
                          ARC-ed, whereas this takes about 2 KB.
                          What I'm referring to is an archive of
                          1-3 files that explains how to remove
                          the serial numbers from copywrite. Now
                          it's allright to "unprotect" a program
                          for backup purposes, but removing serial
                          numbers can only lead to piracy.

DOG101A.COM           HC  This may be hacked; keep an eye out
                         for it as well as DOG102A.COM.

DOG102A.COM           HC  Apparently this is a renamed early
                         version of DP102A.ARC, a disk optimizer.
                         One person has reports that it trashes
                         hard disks that use DOS 3.1 (2KB
                         clusters).

FLUSH4.ARC            H   This is apparently FluShot v. 3.0.  Be
                         careful with this; it comes with a trojan
                         horse disguised as self-executable
                         documentation.

LIST60                H   Vern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read
                         6.0.  Mr. Buerg has released a legitimate
                         version 6.0 of LIST.  Every legit.
                         version will have a letter in the
                         filename (e.g. LIST60H.ARC)

LIST799               H   Vern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read
                         7.99.

LOCKPICK              MT  This is a text file, usually with a
                          .TXT extension, that casually explains
                          how to pick locks.  This is not 
                          illegal, but it's definitely in
                          poor taste.  It could be used as
                          evidence against a burglar, though.

LZM11.EXE      37376  MU  SysOps work hard to maintain BBS's and
                          to offer quality programs to the general
                          public.  Although we all may not like
                          upload/download ratios, common sense
                          indicates that if a SysOp wants to
                          maintain an upload/download ratio, then
                          s/he has that right.  LZM, or Leech
                          Zmodem, attempts to circumvent this
                          right.  LZM downloads files using Chuck
                          Foresburg's DSZ and aborts the transfer
                          instantly after receiving the last block
                          of information.  Thus the BBS does not
                          count the download against the callers
                          account, thinking the download
                          unsuccessful, and the caller winds up
                          with a "free" copy of the file.  SysOps,
                          please unite against this menace.  I
                          strongly recommend that you threaten to
                          permanently remove any caller you catch
                          using LZM.  Any version of DSZ later
                          than 1/8/89 can detect and nullify LZM
                          1.1.  However, LZM 1.2 is already
                          circulating boards and it reputedly
                          defeats the 1/13/89 version of DSZ.  Be
                          Careful.

MONEY.ARC             MT  This text file claims that with minimal
MONEY.TXT  11648          effort YOU can become a millionaire.
                          This text file, as some of you may know,
                          is simply another chain (pyramid) letter
                          that is of course illegal.  A pyramid
                          writer sends a letter to four people
                          requesting money.  Then, according to
                          the pyramid writer's plan, those four
                          will send letters to four more asking
                          for money for themselves and the
                          original writer.  Unfortunately when the
                          chain breaks people lose money.  What
                          one person gains someone else must lose.
                          That's why this type of letter is
                          illegal.
MONOPOLY              MG  Finally I am SURE that this file
                          violates Parker Brother's rights
                          to the famous boardgame.  Don Gibson has
                          agreed that monopoly should NOT be
                          distributed anymore, so SysOps, please
                          remove this file from your download
                          directories.

MOVBASIC or           MU  This highly illegal file, sometimes also
SBASICA                   called SBASICA, breaks IBM's copyright
                          on BASIC and BASICA.  It creates new
                          files called SBASIC or SBASICA that run
                          "IBM BASIC" on an IBM clone.  C'mon,
                          don't you think that these clones don't
                          run IBM BASICA for a good reason?  The
                          clones don't support BASICA because it's
                          illegal!  This file comes with Alloy's
                          PC-Slave card.  Alloy has a license
                          agreement, and users of the PC-Slave are
                          allowed to create copies of IBM BASIC
                          for themselves.  NO ONE ELSE IS.  Stop
                          complaining that this file is legal,
                          people; this is one of the more blatent
                          cases of piracy that I've seen.

NEWARKR.EXE           H   Phil Katz's PKWare Package with all
                         references to the PKWare license removed.

PKXARC36.EXE          H   Phil Katz's PKXARC 3.5 patched to read
                         3.6

PKXARC53.EXE          H   Phil Katz's PKXARC 3.5 patched to read
                         5.3

QMDM110.ARC           H   This is version 1.09 of Qmodem patched
                         to read 1.10.  There have been rumors of
                         a worm in 1.10, but I have seen no
                         evidence of it.  Other versions are OK.

XTALK                 MP  Like Copywrite, there is a patch
                          circulating BBS's to remove the serial
                          numbers from Crosstalk.
