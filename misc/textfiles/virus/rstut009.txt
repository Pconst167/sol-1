The Advantages of having a Memory Resident Virus, are unlimited. When our  
virus goes `TSR' it REALLY doesn't do ANYTHING. It just stays there,       
waiting to be called upon. the 80x86 really doesn't MULTITASK, so don't    
think the virus runs `in the Background' TSRs tend to hook on Interrupts,  
depending what function they must do. If it must be called upon OFTEN,     
hook Int 1C, if your must run when an File is Executed/Open/Close Hook     
Int 21h. And everytime Int 21h is called, Your Virus Runs FIRST, then it   
calls the original Int 21h.                                                
                                                                           
I will try to explain on how cut off a block of Memory, Then we'll         
allocate memory for the Virus, change the program MCB, and move the        
virus resident in memory.

That is all needed to do the trick. And it will not show up with the Memory
Mapping Utilities like MEM or CHKDSK. However Dos will report Available    
memory to be short by the Number of Paragraphs we Allocated. I will try    
to fix this DARN thing that drives me crazy, I believe it can be solved    
like our FCB Dir Method, Where we can add the Number of Paragraphs our     
Virus Allocated back to them Memory Mapping Utilities. There IS a WAY!     
And we will find it... This topic will be continued in Info Journal #5.
