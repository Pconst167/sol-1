Synonyms: Bouncing Ball, Vera Cruz, Ping-Pong, Bouncing Dot, Missouri
virus.

Date of Origin: March, 1988.

Host Machine: PC compatibles. Original version won't infect 80286 or
80386 computers or hard disks.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects boot sector on any disk with at
least two sectors per cluster.

OnScreen Symptoms: A bouncing ball or dot may appear on the screen upon
activation.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts or
overwrites boot sector. Does no apparent damage.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot, or DOS SYS command.

Description of Operation: This is a boot sector virus. Some forms infect
only floppies, others will also infect the boot sector of hard disks. 
This virus consists of a boot sector and 1 cluster (2 sectors used)
marked as bad in the first copy of the FAT.  The first of these sectors
contains the rest of the virus, and the second contains the original boot
sector.  It infects all disks which have at least two sectors per
cluster, and it occupies 2K of memory.

     When this virus activates (randomly) a bouncing dot/bouncing diamond
(ASCII 4) /bouncing smiley face (ASCII 2)<Note: Depends on the strain
which is running. There are at least three strains.> appears on the
screen and can only be removed through reboot. The virus can be triggered
by a disk access, should one occur during a one second window that occurs
about every half hour. When triggered, the dot bounces off the edges of
the screen, and passes through any text, with replacement after it. 
Sometime, this doesn't work properly, the bouncing character interacts
with the characters on the screen, and screen displays are messed up. 
Infected diskettes have 1K in bad sectors, infected hard disks have 2K
(and other numbers of bad sectors are possible).  No known intentional
damage. Unintentional damage - the two copies of the FAT are left
different; DOS might not like this.  Attempts to infect diskettes slows
them down, and some computers won't read floppies, due to time-outs.  No
other damage is done.

Recovery: Recover by powering down the system, and then using a
write-protected DOS disk to boot.  Use the SYS command from the floppy to
attempt to re-create a good boot sector.  Alternatively, use the program
MD.
