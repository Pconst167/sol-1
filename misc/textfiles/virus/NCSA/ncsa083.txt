     The Joker was isolated in Poland in December, 1989. This virus is a
generic .EXE file infector, and is a poor replicator (ie. it does not
quickly infect other files).<Note: Note that reports are mixed on this
virus. Some claim that it is resident, and infects COM and COMMAND.COM,
but not EXE files.>
