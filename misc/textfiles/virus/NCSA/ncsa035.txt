Synonyms: 1704-B, 1701-B, Blackjack virus

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects COM files.

OnScreen Symptoms: There is no cascade display on the screen for this
version. The system will reboot at random intervals after activation.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 1701 bytes (will infect both PCs and
compatibles) or 1704 bytes (will infect only PC compatibles).

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program or
overlay files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: M-1704, M-1704C, CleanUp, or F-Prot. You may also follow the
instructions for removing the Jerusalem virus.

Derived from: Cascade.

Scan Code: Uses self-encryption.  FA 8B EC E8 00 00 5B 81 EB 31 01 2E F6
87 2A 01 01 74 0F 8D B7 4D 01 BC 85 06 31 34 31 24 46 4C 75 F8. You can
also search at offset 01BH for 31 34 31 24 46 4C 77 F8.

     This virus is identical to the Cascade  except for these two changes:

*   it activates in the fall of any year;

*   the cascading display has been replaced with a system re-boot when
    the virus activates.

     The activation uses the same interrupt 8 randomization algorithm, so
the reboot will occur at a random time interval after executing an
infected program on or after the activation date.

     This virus has the ability to infect a file more than once. Cleanup
works well at removing the virus, even from files infected multiple
times (Cleanup will have to be run the same number of times that the file
is infected). Be warned though, if you find a file has been infected more
than once, remove the virus and delete the file, as files infected more
than once will hang your computer. Files infected only once by this virus
seem to run OK after removing the virus.
