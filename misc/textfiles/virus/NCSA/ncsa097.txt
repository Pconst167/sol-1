Synonyms: Stoned-B.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects boot sector of floppy disk and
partition table of hard disk.

OnScreen Symptoms: The screen will sometimes display "Your PC is now
stoned!"

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts or
overwrites boot sector. Directly or indirectly corrupts file linkage.

Detected by: Scanv56+, CleanUp, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot.

Derived from: New Zealand.

Scan Code: You can search at offset 043H for B8 01 02 0E 07 BB 00 02 33
C9.

     This is a variation of New Zealand.  Much of the code has been
reorganized.  The only significant change in function, however, is that
the original boot sector is stored at track zero, head zero, sector seven
on a hard disk.  The second string ("Legalise Marijuana!") is not
transferred when infecting a hard disk. The virus occupies space in the
hard disk's partition table.

     The hard disk is infected as soon as an infected floppy is booted. No
intentional damage is done by New Zealand-B, except systems with RLL
controllers will frequently hang.

     Removal instructions are the same as for the original New Zealand
virus for diskettes. However, an infected hard disk must be disinfected
by using MDisk with the /P parameter, with CleanUp, or NDD, because the
partition table has been infected.
