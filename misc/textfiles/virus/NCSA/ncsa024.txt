Date of Origin: Fall, 1989.

Host Machine: Macintosh.

     The Apple virus is a "RESET" instruction followed by a "NOP"
instruction. The unusual sequence of statements (normally one would put
the "NOP" before the "RESET") makes it a surprisingly hard to detect and
disassemble. To propagate, the user must use Apple's Resource Editor
(ResEdit) to cut and paste this virus into every program that they want
it to infect.  The virus seems to be more a tool for virus planters than
something that will be causing widespread damage directly.
