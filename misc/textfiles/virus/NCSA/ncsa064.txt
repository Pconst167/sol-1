Synonyms: Ghostballs.

Date of Origin: September, 1989.

Place of Origin: Iceland.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: COM files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 2351 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts or overwrites boot sector; corrupts COM
files.

Detected by: Scanv46+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: MDisk or DOS SYS command (accompanied by erasing infected
COM files), or use CleanUp or F-Prot.

     The Ghost viruses (both boot and COM) were discovered at Icelandic
University by Fridrik Skulason. The Ghost COM virus infects generic COM
files, increasing the file size by 2,351 bytes.

     Symptoms of this virus are very similar to the Ping Pong virus, and
random file corruption may occur on infected systems.

     The Ghost COM virus may be the first virus to infect both files (COM
files in this case) and boot sectors. After the boot sector is infected,
it also acts as a virus (see Ghost BOOT virus).

     To remove this virus, turn off the computer and reboot from a
write-protected disk. Then use MDisk, NDD, or the DOS SYS command to
replace the boot sector on the infected disk. Any infected .COM files
must also be replaced with clean copies.
