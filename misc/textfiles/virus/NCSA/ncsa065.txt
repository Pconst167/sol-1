Synonyms: the 500 Virus, Mazatlan.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: boot sector.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a

Nature of Damage: Infects boot sector of floppies, may eventually
reformat the hard disk.

Detected by: ScanV60+. (Identifies it as the Alameda).

Removed by: MDisk, F-Prot, or the DOS SYS command.

Derived from: Alameda.

     This is the Alameda or SF Virus that has been modified to format the
C: drive when the counter runs out. The activation occurs after 500
infections, instead of 100 infections. Note that in all three of these
strains, the counter is zeroed on the host diskette at infection time.
Thus, the activation period on this virus will on the average stretch
into many years. No corruption will occur until 500 new diskettes have
been infected from within a given machine. Since the infection can only
occur when the system is booted with a new diskette, infection is not
frequent with this virus. The majority of infections will probably never
activate. The IBM PC will have long since been supplanted by another
architecture in most environments.
