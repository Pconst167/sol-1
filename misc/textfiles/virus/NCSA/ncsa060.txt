Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: COM files.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts COM files.

Derived from: Friday 13th.

     This virus is identical to the original except that it infects every
file in the current subdirectory. It will also infect every COM file in
the system path if the infected COM program is in the path. The only way
this virus can spread beyond the current subdirectory is if an infected
program ends up in the system PATH. Then every COM file in the currently
selected subdirectory will get infected.
