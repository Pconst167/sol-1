Synonyms: the Russian Virus.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Derived from: Jerusalem-C

     This virus is the Jerusalem-C that has odd text and additional code
that is never referenced. A new interrupt eight routine is added to the
non-referenced area and a number of interrupt 21 calls which appear
meaningless. The additional text includes "ANTIVIRUS". It appears that
this virus is a modified version of the Jerusalem-C/New Jerusalem.

     Note that because of the difference in EGA and CGA int 10 usage,
Jerusalem A has been observed with the blackhole effect noted on an EGA
screen.
