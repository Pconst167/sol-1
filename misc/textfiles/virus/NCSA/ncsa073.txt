Synonyms: December 24th virus

Date of Origin: December, 1989.

Place of Origin: Iceland.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects EXE files.

OnScreen Symptoms: The message "Gledelig jol" may appear on December 24.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 843, 853, or 863 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program
files.

Detected by: Scanv57+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or F-Prot, or delete infected files.

Derived from: Icelandic virus.

Scan Code: May be identified by the last four bytes of an infected
program, "1844,195F"H -- a reversal of the ID of Icelandic I and II. You
can also search at offset 106H for 2E C6 06 6F 02 0A 90 50 53 51.

     The Icelandic-III virus is very similar to the Icelandic Virus, from
which it was adapted. There are minor changes including the addition of
several NOP instructions.

     This virus will not infect any program previously infected by
Icelandic or Icelandic-II.

     If an infected program is run on December 24th of any year, programs
subsequently run will be stopped, later displaying the message "Gledileg
jol" ("Merry Christmas" in Icelandic) instead.
