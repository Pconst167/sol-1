Synonyms: 642, One in Two

Date of Origin: July, 1989

Place of Origin: Calfornia

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Memory resident. Infects EXE files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 642 bytes.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, F-Prot, or delete infected files.

Derived from: Icelandic II?

     This virus appears to be derived from the Icelandic-II viruses.
Modifications include:

*   When Saratoga copies itself to memory, it modifies the memory block
    so that it appears to belong to the operating system, thus preventing
    reuse of the block.

*    Like Icelandic-II, this virus can infect programs which have been
    marked Read-Only, though it does not restore the Read-Only attribute
    to the file afterwards.

     Similar to the Icelandic-II virus, the Saratoga can infect programs
even if the system has installed an anti-viral TSR which "hooks"
interrupt 21, such as FluShot+.
