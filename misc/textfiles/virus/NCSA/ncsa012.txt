Synonyms: Traceback.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects COM, EXE files.

OnScreen Symptoms: Cascading display one hour after activation, lasting
one minute, followed by restoration of screen to condition prior to
cascade.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 3066 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts COM and EXE files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: M-3066, VirClean, F-Prot, or delete any infected files.

Derived from: Traceback II/2930.

Scan Code: E8 71 06 E8 28 06 B4 19 CD 21 89 B4 51 01 81 84 51 01 84 08 8C
8C 53 01. You can also search at 108H for 89 B4 51 01 81 84 51 01 84 08.

     After an infected program is run, Traceback becomes memory resident,
infecting every COM or EXE that is run. Additionally, if the system date
is after December 5, 1988, it will attempt to infect one additional COM
or EXE file in the current directory. If no uninfected file are available
in the current directory, it searches the entire disk, starting at the
root directory, looking for a victim. This search terminates if it
encounters an infected file before finding a candidate non-infected
file.

     This virus derives its name from two characteristics:

*  Infected files contain the directory path of the file causing the
   infection within the viral code. Consequently, it is possible to
   "trace back" the infection through a number of files.

*  When Traceback succeeds in infecting a program, it attempts to
   update a counter in the program from which Traceback was
   activated in that session. Because Traceback takes over disk error
   handling while trying to update the original infected program, the
   user will be unaware that an error occurred if Traceback can't
   update its counter.

     The primary symptom of the Traceback virus having infected the
system is that it will produce a screen display with a cascading effect
similar to the Cascade/1701/1704 virus. The cascading display occurs one
hour after system memory is infected, and lasts one minute, after which
the display is restored. Any keystroke during this interval will hang up
the system. The cascade/restore sequence is repeated at one hour
intervals. See also 2930.
