Synonyms: Companion Virus

Date of Origin: April, 1990.

Place of Origin: The Netherlands?

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: non-resident. Infects COM and EXE files.

OnScreen Symptoms: See messages below. Also a melody is played.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 8,064 bytes.

Nature of Damage: none.

Detected by: on-screen message.

Removed by: delete COM files created by the virus. They will bear the
date and time of infection.

     This virus does not infect files, but rather creates a 8,064 byte COM
file of the same name as an existing EXE file. When a user enters the
first name of the EXE file, the COM file runs, a melody is played, and
the COM file displays the message: "Your computer is infected with...
(heart character) Aids Virus II. - Signed WOP & PGT of DutchCrack - ".
The COM file then "spawns" the EXE file's process -- permits the normal,
uninfected EXE to run, after which control is returned to the COM file. 
At this time, the melody is played again, and the message displayed is
"Getting used to me? Next time, use a condom..."

     The virus is significant in that it "infects" a file without touching
it at all, and thus escapes detection by CRC examination programs.
