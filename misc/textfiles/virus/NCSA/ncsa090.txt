Date of Origin: November, 1989.

Place of Origin: Lisbon, Portugal.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: COM files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 648 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts one out of eight COM programs by overwriting.

Detected by: Scanv49+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or F-Prot.

Derived from: Vienna

     This virus was discovered by Jean Luz, an NCSA member in Lisbon,
Portugal, in November, 1989. It infects COM files and increases the size
of infected programs by 648 bytes. It destroys 1 out of 8 infected
programs by overwriting "@AIDS" on top of the first five bytes of the
infected program.

     The virus is very similar to Vienna, except that almost every word in
the virus has been shifted 1-2 bytes in order to avoid virus
identification/detection programs which could identify the Vienna
virus.
