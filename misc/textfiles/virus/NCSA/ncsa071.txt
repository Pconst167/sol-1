Synonyms: Saratoga 1, Icelandic, One in Ten, Disk Crunching Virus.

Date of Origin: June, 1989.

Place of Origin: Iceland.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects EXE files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 642 bytes. A variant adds 656 bytes.
Another grows by 671 bytes. File lengths after infection are divisible
by 16.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program
files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or F-Prot.

Scan Code: Infected files always end with 44 18 5F 19. You can also
search at offset 0C6H for 2E C6 06 87 02 0A 90 50 53 51.

     The Icelandic virus was first detected in June, 1989, disassembled a
week later, and the disassembly was made available around the beginning
of July. The basic Icelandic virus is a resident EXE-file infector that
infects every second EXE file executed, and sometimes will mark a free
cluster on a hard disk as bad (the "damage" routine).

     The Icelandic virus will copy itself to the top of free memory the
first time an infected program is executed. Once in high memory, it hides
from memory mapping programs. If a program later tries to write to this
area of memory, the computer will crash. If the virus finds that some
other program has "hooked" Interrupt 13, it will not proceed to infect
programs. If Interrupt 13 has not been "hooked", it will attempt to
infect every 10th program executed.

     The virus attaches itself to the end of the programs it infects, and
infected files will always end with "4418,5F19"H.

     On systems with 12-bit FATs (floppy drives or 10 MB hard disks), the
virus will not cause any damage. However, on systems with 16-bit FATs
(hard disks larger than 10 MB), the virus will select one unused FAT
entry and mark the entry as a bad sector each time it infects a program.

     It is likely that as of this writing, the virus has not been detected
outside of Iceland.  Several variants are known, including Saratoga 2,
Icelandic Virus Version 2, and MIX1. See also the table.<Note: Prepared
