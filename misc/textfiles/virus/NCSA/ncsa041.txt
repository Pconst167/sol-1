Date of Origin: December, 1987.

Host Machine: IBM E-mail system.

     This virus circulated a Christmas greeting throughout IBM's
worldwide E-mail system in December, 1987.  The virus overloaded the
network, forcing IBM to shut it down temporarily.<Note: Knight-Ridder
News Service, "For Many Users, `Viruses' are Nothing New" reprinted in
The Washington Post, November 28, 1988, p. F25.>  The virus was sent by
a West German law student to friends through a local European academic
research network. The virus told the receiver's computer to display the
greeting, then quietly send the virus and message to everyone on the
recipient's regular electronic mailing list.  It turned out that someone
on the list had special, restricted access to IBM's E-mail network of
several thousand computers in 145 countries.  IBM has since modified
their system to make repetition improbable.<Note: Philip J. Hilts,

Programmers Spread Destructive Bits of Bogus Instructions Across the
World" The Washington Post, May 8, 1988, p. A3.>
