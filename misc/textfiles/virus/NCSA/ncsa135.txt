Synonyms: 637

Date of Origin: December, 1989.

Place of Origin: Poland.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Memory resident. Infects EXE files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 637 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts program files.

Detected by: F-Prot, Scanv60+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: F-Prot, Scan/D, or delete infected files.

     When an infected file is run, Vcomm attempts to infect one EXE file
in the current directory. During infection, Vcomm first pads the file so
that the file's length to a multiple of 512 bytes, then it adds its 637
bytes of virus code to the end of the file.

     The memory resident portion of the virus intercepts any disk writes
that are attempted, and changes them into disk reads.
