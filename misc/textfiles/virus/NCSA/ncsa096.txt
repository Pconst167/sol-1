History: This virus was first reported in Wellington, New Zealand in
early 1988.

Description of Operation: This virus consists of a boot sector only.  It
infects any disk inserted in a drive after it becomes activated during a
boot, and it occupies 1K of memory.  The original boot sector is held in
track zero, head one, sector three on a floppy disk, and track zero, head
zero, sector two on a hard disk.  The boot sector contains two character
strings: "Your PC is now Stoned!" and "LEGALISE MARIJUANA!". The first
of these messages is only displayed one in eight times when booting from
an infected floppy, the second is unreferenced.  In some variations, the
message is displayed on every 32nd boot.

     In the original version of this virus, only 360 KB 5 1/4" floppies
were infected.  While the original version was unable to infect a hard
disk, other versions (such as New Zealand B) are capable of doing so.

     The virus can (unintentionally) trash 1.2 Mb floppies if they have
more than 32 files, and trashes about 5% of hard disks.<Note: Dr. Alan
Solomon. "The Information Center - PC Security", 1989.>

Removal: The Stoned virus can be removed from 360KB diskettes by using
either the MDisk, CleanUp, or F-Prot programs. It can also be removed
from diskettes by using the DOS SYS command. Be sure to power down your
system and reboot from a clean, write-protected floppy prior to
attempting disinfection.
