     History: The Jerusalem virus was first discovered at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem on December 24, 1987, and reported to the virus
research community by Y. Radai of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  My
personal suspicion is that the virus was written by a Palestinian, or
other enemy of Israel, and planted within Israel. Israel was declared an
independent state on May 14, 1948. Friday, May 13, 1988 would have been
40 years in which Palestine was no longer sovereign.  Although it was
detected in late 1987, it contained code to prevent it from going off
until May 13, 1988. Other viruses set to go off on Friday the 13th are
likely copy-cats, whose authors simply thought that Friday the 13th was
unlucky, wanted a trigger date, and thought this would do fine.

Operation: This virus is a memory resident infector.  Any "clean
program" run after an infected program is run will become infected.  Both
COM and EXE files are infected. The virus occurs attached to the
beginning of a COM file, or the end of an EXE file.  A COM file also has
the five-byte marker attached to the end.  This marker is usually (but
not always) "MsDos", and is preceeded in the virus by "sU". "sUMsDos" is
not usually found in newer varieties of this virus.  COM files increase
in length by 1813 bytes.  EXE files usually increase by 1808 bytes, but
the displacement at which to write the virus is taken from the length in
the EXE header and not the actual length.  This means that part or all of
this 1808 bytes may be overwritten on the end of the host program.

     It becomes memory-resident when the first infected program is run,
and it will then infect every program run except COMMAND.COM.  COM files
are infected once only, EXE files are re-infected each time they are run.


     Interrupt 8 is redirected. After the system has been infected for
thirty minutes (by running an infected program), an area of the screen
from row 5 column 5 to row 16 column 16 is scrolled up two lines creating
a black two line "window".  From this point a time-wasting loop is
executed with each timer interrupt, slowing the system down by a factor
of 10.

     If the system was infected with a system date of Friday the
thirteenth, every program run will be deleted instead.  This will
continue irrespective of the system date until the machine is rebooted. 
The end of the virus, from offset 0600H, is rubbish and will vary from
sample to sample.

     Jerusalem contains a flaw which makes it re-infect EXE (but not COM)
files over and over (up to five times or until the file becomes too big
to fit into memory, whichever comes first.) 

     The names 1808 and 1813 come from the fact that files grow by 1808 or
1813 bytes, without changing their date and time or read/write/hidden
attributes.  COMMAND.COM does not grow, to help it avoid detection. In
fact, it seems likely that the disk version of COMMAND.COM is not
modified, but that the in-memory copy of COMMAND.COM is modified when an
infected program is run.

     The virus causes some intentional damage:

*   there is code in the virus for deleting each program that you run on
    every Friday 13th. On January 13 (Friday), 1989, this virus made a
    shambles of hundreds of PC-compatibles in Britain<Note: Jonathan
    Randal, "Friday the 13th is Unlucky for British Computer Users;
    Software Virus Disrupts IBM PC Programs" The Washington Post,
    January 14, 1989, p. D10.> 

*   The virus re-directs interrupt 8 (among others) and one-half hour
    after an infected program loads, the new timer interrupt introduces a
    delay which slows down the processor by a factor of 10. (see figure).

     It is difficult to estimate the total dollar value of damage done by
this virus to date. In just one case, reported in the Israeli newspaper
Maariv, it destroyed $15,000 worth of software and two disks in which
7,000 hours of work had been invested.<Note: Reported by Jonathan
Randal, "Friday the 13th is Unlucky for British Computer Users; Software
Virus Disrupts IBM PC Programs" The Washington Post, January 14, 1989,
p. D10.>

     Disinfection can be a complex process.  UNVIRUS will easily
eradicate this virus and 5-6 others as well. IMMUNE will prevent further
infection.

     Alternatively, shareware programs written by Dave Chamber and
distributed through bulletin boards under the name M-J may be used. M-J
removes the virus from hard disks; M-JFA removes the virus from floppy
disks that are inserted into the system's A drive; M-JFB removes the
virus from floppy disks that are inserted into the system's B
drive.<Note: The M-J disinfector is successful in removing the Jerusalem
virus in virtually all instances. However, it will destroy, on the
average, one EXE file in ten during the disinfection attempt. It will not
harm COM files. It is recommended that every infected program be
executed after the disinfection process. Programs that have been
disabled during the disinfection process will not execute.>

     Alternatively, here is the process for removal:

*   power down the system.

*   Boot from a write-protected, clean system master diskette.

*   Delete all of the infected programs as indicated by VIRUSCAN.

*   Replace the programs from original write-protected program
    distribution diskettes.

*   Do not execute any program from the infected hard disk until the
    disinfection process is complete.

*   After cleaning all hard drives in the infected system, all floppies
    that have come into contact with the system should be SCANned and
    disinfected in the same manner.

     Another means of detection: using PCtools or another text search
utility, search for the ASCII string "sUMsDos". This string is present
in all copies of this particular virus strain.
