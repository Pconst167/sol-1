Synonyms: Dark Avenger III, Stealth virus, Travel virus

Date of Origin: February, 1990.

Place of Origin: Sophia, Bulgaria

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects COM (including COMMAND.COM), EXE,
and overlay files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 2000 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program
and overlay files. Corrupts file linkage.

Detected by: Scanv59+

Removed by: Scan/D

Scan Code: "Zopy me - I want to travel". Also contains "(c) 1989 by
Vesselin Bontchev".

     V2000 may look for and delete any programs written by the Bulgarian
Vesselin Bontchev, and contains a copyright notice for him, suggesting
the virus was written neither by him nor by one of his admirers.

     V2000 can make a mess of things. If V2000 is present in memory, a DIR
command won't show that files have grown in size. CHKDSK/F may produce
crosslinked files. System crashes can occur, and some systems won't
boot, due to the modification of COMMAND.COM or the hidden system files.
