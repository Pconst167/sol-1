Synonyms: 2608 virus

Date of Origin: October, 1989

Place of Origin: Vancouver, BC, Canada

Host Machine: Amiga.

Host Files: non-boot sector virus.

Description of Operation: Works like the IRQ virus, attaching itself to
the first executable in the startup-sequence.  However, it copies the
found executable to devs:"    " and copies itself into the old name in the
"C" directory (size 2608 bytes).  Whenever the command is executed it
calls the virus which in turn would call the REAL command, thus giving
the appearance that all is well.

     On about every fifth warm boot, the virus displays a message briefly,
containing the words "Virus Exterminator..."
