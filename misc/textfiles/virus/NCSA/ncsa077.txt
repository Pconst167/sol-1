Synonyms: 3880 virus

Date of Origin: March, 1990.

Place of Origin: Milan, Italy.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: EXE files. Non-resident.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 3,880 bytes

Detected by: Scan v.60+.

Removed by: Scan/D, or delete whatever is infected.

     Recognition of this virus is straightforward. EXE files will grow in
length by 3,880 bytes, and a file named ?OMMAND.COM (where ? is a non-
printing character) will be found on the disk. This file contains the
virus, and is used as a source of the code during infection.

     Itavir won't activate until it has been in the system for 24 hours or
more. Upon activation, it corrupts the boot sector, so that the system
will not boot after power down. A message (in Italian) is displayed, and
ASCII codes 0-255 are sent to all ports. Some monitors will flicker or
(if VGA) will hiss when this occurs.
