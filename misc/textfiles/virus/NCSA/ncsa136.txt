History: The virus was first detected in Vienna in December, 1987. In
April, 1988, this virus surfaced in Moscow at a children's summer
computer camp run by UNESCO. Someone who didn't know of its prior
existence in Austria gave it the name DOS-62, presumably because its
method of indicating an already infected file is to set the seconds field
of the time entry of the file to 62.<Note: Contributed by Y. Radai.>

Description of Operation: This virus is a memory resident virus. It
infects COM files (including COMMAND.COM) as they are loaded and
executed. The infected files increase in size by approximately 648
bytes. Some infected programs will not run.

     The first three bytes of the program are stored in the virus, and
replaced by a branch to the beginning of the virus.  The virus looks for,
and infects, one COM file - either in the current directory or in one of
the directories on the PATH.

     One in eight files infected does not get a copy of the virus. 
Instead the first five bytes of the program are replaced by a far jump to
the BIOS initialization routine. That is, in one out of eight attempted
infections, the system will perform a warm reboot when the infected
program is run.

Removal: To remove the virus, follow the instructions provided for the
Jerusalem virus or run M-VIENNA.
