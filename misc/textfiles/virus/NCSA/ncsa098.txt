Synonyms: Stoned-C.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects boot sector of floppy disk and
partition table of hard disk.

OnScreen Symptoms: The screen will not display any message.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts or
overwrites boot sector. Directly or indirectly corrupts file linkage.

Detected by: Scanv56+, CleanUp, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot.

Derived from: New Zealand-B

     This is the Stoned-B virus that no longer displays the "Stoned"
message. This virus is difficult to detect.

     Removal instructions are the same as for the original New Zealand
virus for diskettes. However, an infected hard disk must be disinfected
by using MDisk with the /P parameter or CleanUp, because the partition
table has been infected.
