Synonyms: Stupid virus

Date of Origin: October, 1989.

Place of Origin: Israel.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Resident. Infects COM files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 608 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts program files. Does no apparent damage.

Detected by: Scanv49+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or F-Prot.

     This virus was first reported in October, 1989 by Uval Tal in Israel.
It infects the first COM file in the current directory, and will
re-infect it again and again. It infects no other files, and causes no
other damage.

     It has been called the "stupid" virus because it is so ineffectual
compared to other viruses.  For instance:

*   It always installs in memory in the same location, at address
    9800:100H

*   Any program which attempts to use this memory location destroys the
    memory-resident copy of the virus.

*   It can only infect systems with 640K of memory.

*   It can not reach across directories.

*   It cannot determine if the file it is infecting has previously been
    infected.

*   It does no apparent damage to anything but the first COM file in a
    directory.
