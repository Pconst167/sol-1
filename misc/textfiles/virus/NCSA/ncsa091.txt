Synonyms: Load Runner, Apple II GS Virus

Date of Origin: July, 1989.

Place of Origin: France.

Host Machine: Apple II GS.

Host Files: Boot block virus

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a

Nature of Damage: Erases boot blocks of disk in slot 5, drive 1.  No
files are damaged.

     The damage done by this virus is minimal --it destroys only the boot
blocks of a 3.5" disk (5.25" disks and hard disks seem to be immune),
leaving all the files and directories intact (it can, however, render
some copy-protected games unusable).  LOAD RUNNER has a finite life-span
built in  -- at the same time it starts damaging, it also stops
propagating, and being a boot block virus, it destroys copies of itself
when it destroys the boot blocks.

     Virus copies itself to $E1/BC00 thru $E1/BFFF. Virus resides in the
boot blocks of a 3.5" disk.  Copies itself to $E1/BC00 when disk is
booted.  Copies itself  to disk in slot 5, drive 1 when
CONTROL-APPLE-RESET is pressed. Propagation routine gains control by
patching undocumented system vector in Memory Manager.  Original boot
blocks are not saved --virus contains code to emulate standard boot
process. Infects disks in slot 5, drive 1 only.  Infection of disks
occurs when CONTROL-APPLE-RESET is pressed. Infection of host machine
occurs when an infected disk is booted.

     Triggered by any date between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 inclusive, of any
year.  Damage occurs when an infected disk is booted. If damage occurs,
further infection will not occur. (Note that the damage process wipes
the virus off of the infected disk.)
