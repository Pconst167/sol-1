Synonyms: VGA2CGA, Taunt, Hahaha.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: COM files.

OnScreen Symptoms: When activated, displays "Your computer now has
AIDS". The word "AIDS" covers about half the screen. Following display
of this message, the system halts and must be rebooted..

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Overwrites first 13K of infected programs. Not memory-
resident.

Detected by: Scanv40+, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, or Scan/D, or delete infected .COM files.

     The AIDS virus was first reported attached to a program called
VGA2CGA.  It is known as "Hahaha" in Europe, and IBM refers to it as the
"Taunt" virus. When it activates, it displays the message "Your computer
now has AIDS". After the message display, the system is halted. You will
need to turn it off and reboot to restart it.

     The only protection against the AIDs virus is full backups of your
.COM files. Written in Turbo C, it copies itself over the first 13K bytes
of a .COM file. The original function of the .COM program is lost, and
any other .COM files locatable by the program are also overwritten in
this manner. It evidently has a minimum size which it will not infect,
but it also totally loses all the data at the beginning of the programs.
Recovery of a damage program is not possible. 

     This virus should not be confused with the AIDS Information Disk
Trojan. See also the Lisbon virus.
