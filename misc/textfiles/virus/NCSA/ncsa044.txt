Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: boot sector infector.

OnScreen Symptoms: none.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a

Nature of Damage: destroys the FAT after May 5, 1992.

Derived from: Brain-C

     This virus is the Brain-C that saves the original boot copyright
label and restores it to the infected boot. The Basit & [A]mjad original
Brain messages have been replaced with non-printable garbage that looks
like instructions if viewed through Norton or another utility. Even if
the system is booted from a clean diskette, it is virtually impossible to
tell, by visual inspection, whether the hard disk is infected.
