Synonyms: Syslock, 3555

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Encrypting, non-resident. Infects COM, EXE files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 3551-3555 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts COM and EXE files. May corrupt data files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or F-Prot.

Scan Code: Uses self-encryption.

     When an infected program is run, SysLock searchs through the COM and
EXE files and subdirectories on the current disk, picking one executable
file at random to infect. The infected file will have its length
increased by about 3,551 bytes.

     The SysLock virus will damage files by searching for the word
"Microsoft" in any combination of upper and lower case characters, and
when found replace the word with either "MACROSOFT". If it finds an
environment variable of "SYSLOCK" has been set to "@" (hex 40), the virus
will not infect any programs or perform string replacements, but will
instead pass control to its host immediately. The author may have used
this during the creation of the virus.

     One known variant is called Macho-A. It is identical to the SysLock
virus, except that "Microsoft" is replaced with "MACHOSOFT".
