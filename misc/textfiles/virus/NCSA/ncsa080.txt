Synonyms: the New Jerusalem.

Date of Origin: October 14, 1989.

Place of Origin: first reported in the Netherlands by Fidonet SYSOPS Jan
Terpstra and Ernst Raedecker. May have originated elsewhere in Europe.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects COM, EXE, SYS, BIN, PIF, overlay
files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 1808 bytes (EXE), 1813 bytes (COM).

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program or
overlay files.

Detected by: Scanv45+, F-Prot.

Removed by: CleanUp, Saturday, F-Prot.

Derived from: Jerusalem-B.

     This virus seems to be a special version designed to elude virus
detectors, including McAfee's Scan versions prior to 45 and IBM's
VIRSCAN of October 20, 1989 and earlier.

     This virus is identical to Jerusalem-B except that the timer
interrupt delay code has been bypassed. That is, it will not slow your
computer when it has activated. This virus is virtually invisible until
it activates. It infects both .EXE and .COM files and activates on any
Friday the 13th, deleting infected programs when you attempt to run
them. This virus is memory resident, and as with the other Jerusalem
viruses, may infect overlay, .SYS, .BIN, and .PIF files.
