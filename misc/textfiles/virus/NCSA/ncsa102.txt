Synonyms: Music virus, Musician virus.

Date of Origin: December, 1989.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident; infects COM files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: length increases by 2756-2806 bytes,
so that total length is evenly divisible by 51. Most common length
increase is 2,773 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation; corrupts program
files.

Detected by: Scanv53+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, SCAN/D, F-Prot, or delete infected files.

     A memory resident virus infecting COM files. When an infected
application is executed, the virus installs in memory trapping the DOS
21h interrupt. Thereafter, when a program attempts to create a
subdirectory, remove a subdirectory, create a file, open a file, delete
a file, get/set file attributes, rename a file, delete a file (with FCB),
create file (with FCB) or rename a file (with FCB), one COM file is
infected in the home directory. COMMAND.COM, COM files with length
divisible by 51, COM files with an attribute other than normal or
archive, or COM files with a length of 61980 bytes will not be infected.
The virus seems to activate randomly after infecting a file. If
activated, five minutes after infection it will play 3 or 6 melodies
(depending on version) repeatedly with a 7 minute interval in between
each.
