Date of Origin: September 30, 1989.

Place of Origin: Sofia, Bulgaria.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects COM, EXE files.

OnScreen Symptoms: Plays "Yankee Doodle" on the system speaker some time
after loading.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 2885 or 2899 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts COM and
EXE files.

Detected by: Scanv42+, F-Prot.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, VirClean, F-Prot, or delete infected files.

     This virus was written by Wladimir Bochev from Sofia, Bulgaria, as an
intellectual exercise. It was discovered in Vienna by Alexander Holy at
the United Nation's North Atlantic Project office on Sept 30th, 1989.
The virus has reportedly been transmitted to the U.S. through U.N.
employees via the game "Outrun".

     The virus plays the tune "Yankee Doodle Dandy" on the system's
speaker either when the program is loaded, or 17 hours after an infected
program is loaded, depending on the version of Yankee Doodle. Both COM
and EXE files of any size can be infected, and the virus willingly
infects every such file.

     Infected files grow in size by 2899 bytes. Infected files can be
recognized by the string "motherfucker" at their ends.  In the early
versions, there was no damage caused by the virus. In fact, the virus was
apparently designed as a virus fighter. It will seek out and modify Ping
Pong viruses, changing them so that they self-destruct after 100
infections. Subsequent strains may format the hard disk. Several
variations on the Yankee Doodle virus have been identified. See entries
