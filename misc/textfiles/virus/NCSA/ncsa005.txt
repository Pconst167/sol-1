Synonyms: Stealth Virus

Date of Origin: January, 1990.

Place of Origin: Minnesota.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Encrypting non-resident. Infects
     COM files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 1260 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time
     operation. Corrupts program or overlay files.

Detected by: Scanv57+, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp v57+.

Derived from: Vienna.

Scan Code: Uses variable encryption techniques.

     Although this little thing doesn't become memory resident, it has an
insatiable appetite for COM files, which will become 1,260 bytes longer
after infection. Infected files will be encrypted with a unique key --
every infection produces a different key. The 1260 virus can infect a
LAN's file server and all workstations.
