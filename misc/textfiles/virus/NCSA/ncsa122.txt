Date of Origin: January, 1990.

Place of Origin: Taiwan, R.O.C.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Not memory resident. Infects COM files, including
COMMAND.COM.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 708 or 743 bytes.

Nature of Damage: corrupts COM files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot.

Removed by: CleanUp, Scan/D, or delete infected files.

     Whenever this virus is activated, it attempts to infect up to three
COM files. The search for uninfected COM files begins in the root
directory of C:. Once an uninfected COM file is located, the virus
infects the file by copying the viral code to the first 743 bytes of the
file, relocating the original first 743 bytes of the file to the end of
the COM file. 

     If the COM file selected for infection is less than 743 bytes, the
resulting infected COM file will always be 1,486 bytes in length. This
"bug" results from a failure to check for the original file length.

     The virus is destructive. On the 8th day of any month, when an
infected program is run, the virus will perform an absolute disk write
for 160 sectors starting at logical sector 0 on the C: and D: drives,
overwriting the FATs and root directories.
