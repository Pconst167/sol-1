Place of Origin: West Germany

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: COM and EXE files. Memory resident.

OnScreen Symptoms: keyboard input will appear garbled.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 2,011 bytes.

     First reported by Christoff Fischer of the University of Karlsruhe,
West Germany. It is now widespread in West Germany.

     When an infected program is run, Halloechen installs in memory. From
memory, it infects any EXE or COM which is run, providing the program is
less than about 62K in size, and has a file date outside the current
system date's month. During the infection, the file's size is increased
to a multiple of 16, then the 2,011 bytes of virus code are added to it.
