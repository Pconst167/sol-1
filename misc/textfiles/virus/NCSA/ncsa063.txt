Synonyms: Ghostballs

Date of Origin: September, 1989.

Place of Origin: Iceland.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: hard disk and floppy disk boot sectors.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts or overwrites boot sector.

Detected by: Scanv46+, F-Prot.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot, or use the DOS SYS command.

     This virus was discovered in September, 1989 by Fridrik Skulason at
Icelandic University. The virus infects the boot sectors of hard disks
and floppies. The virus replaces the boot sector of infected systems
with a boot virus similar to Ping Pong. Random file corruption by this
virus has been reported.

     The Ghost Boot virus is usually discovered along with the Ghost COM
virus. If you disinfect the boot sector to get rid of the Boot virus,
unless you also remove the COM virus, your boot sectors will again have
the Ghost Boot virus. It appears that the two viruses assist in the
propagation of each other.
