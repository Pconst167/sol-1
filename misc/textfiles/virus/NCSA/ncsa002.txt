Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Overwriting, non-resident. Infects
     COM (and possibly EXE) files.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: If file is
     shorter than 405 bytes, it is replaced with the 405 byte virus. If
     longer than 405 bytes, the first 405 bytes are overwritten.

Nature of Damage: Overwrites COM files.

Detected by: ScanV46+, F-Prot, IBM Scan.

Removed by: Scan/D, F-Prot, or delete the infected files.

Scan Code: B8 00 00 26 A2 49 02 26 A2 4B 02
     26 A2 8B 02 50 B4 19 CD 21 26 A2 49 02 B4 47 04 01. You can
     search at offset 00AH for 26 A2 49 02 26 A2 4B 02 26 A2.

     This virus overwrites the first 405 bytes of a COM file in the
current directory. If the length of the file to be infected is less than
405 bytes, the length is increased to 405.  Due to coding errors, the
virus unsuccessfully attempts to infect in other than the current
directory. The virus is not able to recognize an infected file. Thus it
will re-infect a file again and again. However, because it overwrites
the first 405 bytes, the infected files do not grow in size. It is
similar to the Virus 1.1 published in Ralf Burger's book.
