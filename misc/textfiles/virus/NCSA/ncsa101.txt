     The Ohio virus is a boot sector virus first discovered at Ohio State
University by Terry Reeves in May, 1989. It only infects 360K floppies.
It will infect any new diskette as soon as the diskette is accessed
(COPY, DIR, DEL, program load, etc.), similar to the Brain. The virus
will freeze the system if a <<Ctrl>><<Alt>><<Del>> is pressed and a cold
boot is then required. When the virus activates, the first copy of the
FAT becomes corrupted. No other symptoms have been reported.

     The Ohio virus is similar in many respects to the Den Zuk virus, and
may be an early version of Den Zuk. A diskette infected with Ohio will be
immune to infection by the Pakistani Brain virus.
