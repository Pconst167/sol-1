     In this version .COM and .EXE files are handled differently.  The
virus is able to avoid many of "virus protection" programs which are
watching the use of "dangerous" interrupts. If the virus is active in
memory, and an infected file is loaded for debugging with CodeView, then
the virus removes itself from the file. Because the virus extracts
itself during loading with Codeview, this is a method of cleaning an
infected file.
