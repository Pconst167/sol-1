Synonyms: Bouncing Ball, Vera Cruz, Ping-Pong-B, Bouncing Dot.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects floppy and hard disk boot sectors.
(The original infected only floppy disks).

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Affects system run-time operation. Corrupts program or
overlay files.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot, or DOS SYS command.

Derived from: Italian.

     This is a variation of Italian that is able to infect hard disks.

     Some of the characteristics are:

*   Fairly long time before activation (a number of minutes at least)

*   It displays a ball character, not the Diamond Character

*   Once activated, the ball bounces around the screen until the system
    is shut off.

*   Formatted system & non-system disks are infected and have the one bad
    spot created by the virus.

*   When a user attempts to format the hard disk, format scans the disk OK
    and then reports that track 0 is bad.

*   Formatted system floppy disks tend to lock up the PC on boot, and warm
    reboot doesn't work.

*   The main problem is re-infection and spreading to other machines.
