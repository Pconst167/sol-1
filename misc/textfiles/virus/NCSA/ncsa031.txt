Synonyms: Pakistani, Pakistani Brain, Basit Virus.

Date of Origin: January, 1986.

Place of Origin: Lahore Pakistan.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: Remains resident. Infects floppy disk boot sector.

OnScreen Symptoms: None. Use DIR to find a volume label on an infected
floppy: "(c) Brain". Using a sector editor, you should be able to find
"(c) Brain" in sector 0, as well.

Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Nature of Damage: Resident, taking 3-7K of RAM. Corrupts or overwrites
boot sector.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: CleanUp, MDisk, F-Prot, or DOS SYS command.

Derived from: This virus appears to be "an original."

     This virus originated in January, 1986, in Lahore Pakistan, but the
first noticeable infection problems did not surface until 1988<Note: In
the spring of 1988, for instance, 100 machines at The Providence
Journal-Bulletin were infected with it.>.

     The Brain is unusual in that it includes the valid names, address and
phone numbers of the original perpetrators. It was written by two
brothers running a computer store in Lahore Pakistan. According to some
sources, Basit Farooq Alvi (one of the brothers) wrote the virus so that
it would infect machines running bootleg copies of a program he was
selling for physicians. The original Brain put a copyright notice in the
directory of floppy disks, but did no other damage to floppy disks, and
would not infect hard disks.

     This virus consists of a boot sector and three clusters (6 sectors)
marked as bad in the FAT.  The first of these sectors contains the
original boot sector, and the rest contain the rest of the virus.  It
only infects 360K floppies, and it occupies 7K of memory.

     The original Brain will infect a diskette whenever the diskette is
referenced. For example, a DIR command, executing a program from the
diskette, copying a file from or to the diskette or any other access will
cause the infection to occur. The virus stores the original boot sector,
and six extension sectors, containing the main body of the virus, in
available sectors which are then flagged as bad sectors.  Diskettes have
3K of bad sectors (possibly more, if there are genuinely bad sectors, as
well.)

     The Brain causes no known intentional damage.  However, it can slow
diskette access a bit, and may cause time-outs, which can make some
diskette drives unusable.

     Any attempts to examine the boot sector are likely to be intercepted
by the Brain when it is memory resident, redirecting the "view" to the
relocated boot sector. Thus, programs like the Norton Utilities will be
unable to "see" the virus.

     There are a number of unused character strings which can be used to
identify it:

     Infected diskettes are noticeable by "@BRAIN" or "(c) BRAIN"

some have had the "(c) Brain" label removed, to make detection more
difficult.
