Synonyms: 1280 virus, Columbus Day, October 12th, October 13th, Friday
13th, Munich Virus, Miami Virus

Date of Origin: March, 1989.

Place of Origin: Europe.

Host Machine: PC compatibles.

Host Files: non-resident. Infects COM files.

OnScreen Symptoms: No screen symptoms during propagation. After October
12 of any year, it will display the message "DATACRIME VIRUS RELEASED 1
MARCH 1989".

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 1280 bytes.

Nature of Damage: Corrupts program or overlay files. Formats or erases
all/part of disk.

Detected by: Scanv56+, F-Prot, IBM Scan, Pro-Scan.

Removed by: AntiCrim, Scan/D, F-Prot, or CleanUp.

Scan Code: 00 56 8D B4 30 05 CD 21 or 8B 36 01 01 83 EE 03 8B C6 3D 00 00
75 03 E9 02 01. Uses self-encryption. You can also search at offset 000H
for 2E 8B 36 01 01 83 EE 03 8B C6.

     The 1280 version of Datacrime is the earliest version, followed by
the 1168 version. Both versions infect COM files, preserving the COM
file's date and time. This virus saves the first three bytes of its host
to a "save area" inside the virus shell, replacing them with a branch to
the beginning of the virus. It appends the shell to the end of the .COM
file on a paragraph boundary.  The resulting file apparently must not
exceed 64K <197> the stack is at the top of the 64K file, where the shell
resides. The stack must have room for virus use. It is not
memory-resident.

     All versions of Datacrime activate after October 12th (hence the
name October 12). In 1989 <197> its year of release <197> the day after
October 12 was Friday the 13th (hence that name). Turning off your
computer on that day will not provide any protection against it. The
first time an infected program is run on or after Oct. 13, the virus will
search through hard drive partitions (C:, then D:, etc.), then the
directories of the A: and B: drives (in that order) for an uninfected COM
file other than COMMAND.COM. It will ignore any COM file with a D as the
seventh letter of its name (as in COMMAND.COM). It will then display the
message: "Datacrime virus released 1 March 1989" and do a low-level
format of cylinder 0 of the hard disk.

     Due to mistakes in the code, the system is almost certain to crash if
the DOS critical error handler is called (caused by a disk missing from a
drive, for example). If the computer has an ESDI, RLL, or SCSI
controller, the virus may be unsuccessful in formatting the hard disk.

     The effect of this formatting is to wipe out the FAT (file allocation
table) and the root directory, making the disk unreadable, except by
special utilities.

     Detection:

*   The original version of the Datacrime will not infect files until
    after April 1st of the year (April Fool's Day).

*   The virus, depending on its variant, appends itself to .COM files
    (except for COMMAND.COM), increasing the .COM file by either 1168 or
    1280 bytes. In addition, the Datacrime II variant can infect .EXE
    files, increasing their size by 1514 bytes.

*   The 1168 byte version contains the hex string EB00B40ECD21B4.

*   The 1280 byte version contains the hex string 00568DB43005CD21.  In
    this version, you can also look for this ten-byte hex pattern:
    2E8B36010183EE038BC6. Note: the text message is encrypted, so it can't
    be identified by a text string search or a disk utility.
