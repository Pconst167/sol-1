     The Pentagon virus consists of:

*   a normal MS-DOS 3.20 boot sector where the name "IBM" has been
    replaced by "HAL".

*   A file with the name of the hex character 0F9H. This file contains the
    portion of the virus code which would not fit into the boot sector, as
    well as the original boot sector of the infected disk. This file is
    addressed by its absolute address, rather than name.

*   A file named PENTAGON.TXT that does not appear to be used or contain
    any data. Portions of this virus are encrypted.

     The Pentagon virus will look for and remove the Brain virus from any
disk that it infects. It is memory resident, occupying 5K of RAM, and can
survive a warm reboot.
