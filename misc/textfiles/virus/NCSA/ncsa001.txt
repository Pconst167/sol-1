Date of Origin: September, 1989.

Host Machine: 80286-based micros.

Host Files: 123DOS.EXE

Increase in Size of Infected Files: 3907 bytes.

Nature of Damage: removes 1/2 of rows, columns in 1-2-3 ver. 3
spreadsheet file.

     This virus was so named because it causes a Lotus 1-2-3 release 3
spreadsheet to be saved exactly one half the size it should be.<Note: For
example, a 100 x 100 cell spreadsheet will only be saved as a 50 x 50 cell
spreadsheet.>

     The 123DOS.EXE file grows in size (one time) by 3907 bytes. Any
spreadsheet saved after the virus has infected the file is exactly half
the size of what it should be.  If the 123DOS.EXE file is erased and
restored from a backup, and 1-2-3 is run again, the file again grows in
size.

     This virus will only infect the 123DOS.EXE file, when running on a
machine with a '286 processor. it will not infect the file on a '386
system. The virus also will not infect files unless there is a minimum of
3 megabytes of extended memory. Expanded memory does not matter and does
not come into the picture.

     Something is missing from our current understanding of this virus:
if the virus infects only 123DOS.EXE, how do you get it? How would it
spread? (Why, that is, would an infected copy of 123DOS.EXE ever find
itself running with access to an uninfected copy; why would there ever be
two different copies of the file on the same machine?).  It is possible
that the virus spread through the disks during production, or that it
comes in with other software, and looks for 123DOS.EXE.

     123SCAN.EXE detects the 123nhalf virus.
