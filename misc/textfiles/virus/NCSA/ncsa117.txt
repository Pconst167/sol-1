     This virus is nearly identical to the Jerusalem virus, which is much
better known, and which was derived from it. The virus activates on
Friday the 13 when an infected program is run.

     It does not delete files, due to a bug in its code. On other days,
after the virus is memory resident for 30 seconds, an area of the screen
is turned into a "black window" and a time wasting loop is executed.

     Differences from the Jerusalem virus:

*   the string "sUMsDos" found in the Jerusalem is "sURIV 3.00" in this
    version.

*   the 30 minute delay (before machine slow-down) in the Jerusalem is 30
    seconds in this version (making detection easier with this virus than
    with the Jerusalem);

*   there is a bug in the program delete function of the virus, making
    this version less lethal than the Jerusalem.
