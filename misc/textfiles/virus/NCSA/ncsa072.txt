     This version of the Icelandic virus differs from the Icelandic in
that it bypasses INT21 and doesn't have the code to mark a cluster bad.
It doesn't have the INT13 check that the second version does.

     Each time the Icelandic-II virus infects a program, it will modify
the file's date, thus making it fairly obvious that the program has been
changed. The virus will also remove the read-only attribute from files,
but does not restore it after infecting the program.

     The Icelandic-II virus can infect programs even if the system is
running an anti-viral TSR that monitors interrupt 21, such as FluShot+.

     On hard disks larger than 10 MB, there are no bad sectors marked in
the FAT as there is with the Icelandic virus.

     Although this version has been called version 2, it may actually have
been the first released draft, and the Icelandic 1 may be the second.
