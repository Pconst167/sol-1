Increase in Size of Infected Files: n/a.

Derived from: Shoe_virus (Ashar).

     This virus is exactly the same as the Shoe_virus (Ashar) in
operation. It was patched to replace offset 0202H, which reads as
follows in the Shoe virus:

(c) 1986 Brain & Amjads (pvt) Ltd 

     with

(c) 1986 Jork & Amjads (pvt) Ltd 

     Another patch the author made to the Shoe_virus was to reduce the
identifying text at offset 0010H to "Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986
Brain".
