

I AM PRETTY PROUD OF THIS ONE, IT CLAIMS TO BE A VIRTUAL MOUSE
DRIVER, BUT ALL IT DOES IS TUNNEL DOWN AND FUCK THE FAT. BTW
THE SETH COMSTOCK GUY IS A REAL PROGRAMMER. I HAVE SEEN WHINING
MESSAGES IN A COUPLE OF ECHOS WITH HIM SAYING "BUT I NOT WRITE
THAT..." I TELL YOU THOUGH, THIS LOOKS SO GOOD I HAVE ALMOST 
RUN IT MYSELF A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN I WAS DRUNK :)

      PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

        * Loads your mouse into the "virtual" Mode.
        * 2 or 3 button mouse or trackball support.
        * works with enhanced keyboards.

           VIRUAMOS is a memory resident program using a little over 1K
        of memory that is loaded after the mouse driver. With VIRUAMOS you
        get a "virtual Reality" appearance to you mouse while not effecting
        the mouses preformance in the least. Viruamos works with most  mouse
        drivers and is loaded after the mouse drivers.




           mouse movement - sends arrow (cursor) key presses
           left button    - sends ฤู (enter) key
           right button   - sends Esc (escape) key
           middle button  - sends Del key (if 3 button mouse )
           left + right buttons at the same time
                          - sends F1 key (F10 key if /t command line
                            switch is used when installing VIRUAMOS )

      -----------------------------------------------------------------
                               Introduction
      -----------------------------------------------------------------


      SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

        IBM PC or compatible, DOS 2.0 or higher,
        Mouse - Microsoft(tm) or Mouse Systems(tm) compatible driver
                software for your mouse or trackball.


      QUICK-START AND USAGE

           The driver for your mouse or trackball must be loaded before
        you can load VIRUAMOS. VIRUAMOS will let you know if a mouse
        driver is not installed with a 'Mouse driver not loaded'
        message. If you know that your mouse driver is loaded, to give
        it a quick try, from the prompt run VIRUAMOS. Then run a text
        editor or word processor program that does not normally work
        with a mouse. You will find that the mouse can be used to move a
        cursor or highlight bar that is normally moved with the cursor
        keys. The left button is the same as pressing the enter key and
        can be used to make selections or enter a return. The right
        button is the same as pressing escape. This works well with
        editors like VDE and QEDIT(tm) that do not provided mouse
        support internally. Note: pressing the right mouse button (Esc
        key) activates the menu system in QEDIT(tm). If you have a three
        button mouse the middle button is the same as pressing the Del
        key. Pressing left + right mouse buttons at the same time is the
        same as pressing the F1 key. The F1 key is the help key in many
        programs. Optionally if you load VIRUAMOS with the command
        'VIRUAMOS /t' the F10 key is sent by pressing the left + right
        buttons. This is for the integrated editor in the Borland Turbo
        languages which use the F10 key to activate the menu system.

           VIRUAMOS function is always restored automatically when
        returning to the command line prompt incase a program has
        disabled VIRUAMOS by using its own mouse functions. VIRUAMOS
        function is also restored by pressing both shift () keys at the
        same time. This is provided for menu programs and other programs
        that allow you to shell out to run another program. When you
        return to the original program, if VIRUAMOS is disabled, press
        both shift keys.

        Note: Load (run) VIRUAMOS from a batch file (autoexec.bat when
        you boot) or from the command line only. DO NOT load VIRUAMOS
        from a program that allows you to run other programs (shell to
        DOS or shells to a command line).



      INSTALLATION AND SET UP

           Copy the file VIRUAMOS.COM to your hard drive or boot disk.

           The following is an example of how to install VIRUAMOS and
        the mouse driver supplied with your mouse or trackball. The name
        of the driver depends on the maker. So <drivername> means to use
        the name of the driver supplied with your mouse. An editor is
        used to enter the lines of text in the config.sys and
        autoexec.bat files. Also read the instructions that came with
        your mouse on how to load your mouse driver software.

           If your mouse driver is a device driver (mouse.sys or
        something similar with a .sys ) it needs to be loaded from the
        config.sys file. Then included "VIRUAMOS" on a line some where
        near the beginning of the autoexec.bat file. If you have copied
        the driver and VIRUAMOS to a directory other than the root then
        you would need to include a path.
        Example line in config.sys:

        device=c:\dos\<drivername>.sys

        And the example line in autoexec.bat:

        c:\util\VIRUAMOS


           If your mouse driver is named mouse.com, msmouse.com or
        something similar, <drivername> is entered on a line in your
        autoexec.bat file. Enter VIRUAMOS on the next line. VIRUAMOS
        will not load unless a mouse driver is loaded first. If you have
        copied the driver and VIRUAMOS to a directory other than the
        root then you would need to include a path.
        Example lines in autoexec.bat:

        c:\dos\<drivername>
        c:\util\VIRUAMOS


           To use a mouse to cursor key speed other than the default,
        include a horizontal and vertical speed value between 1-99 on the
        command line that loads VIRUAMOS.

        The format is - VIRUAMOS <horizontal value> <vertical value>

        Examples -      VIRUAMOS 4 6
                        VIRUAMOS /t  4  6

           VIRUAMOS should be compatible with other TSR (terminate and
        stay resident) programs. You will find that VIRUAMOS works with
        other TSRs. It can be used with programs like CED or STACK to
        recall, edit and run previously entered command lines. I have
        tested it with the program CTRLALT and the mouse can be use
        instead of the cursor keys inside CTRLALT. If you are have
        problems using VIRUAMOS with other TSR programs, try changing
        the order in which VIRUAMOS and the other TSR programs are
        loaded (try loading VIRUAMOS first).
