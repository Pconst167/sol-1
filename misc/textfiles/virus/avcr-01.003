        Well, after reading this garbage I am wondering why somebody
named Thimble would even upload this to the AVCR Magazine section.  I
would normally not use this crap in the magazine, but I would like to
comment on this.  First of all, NuKE has only a handfull of members, I
don't know where this guy got the idea that NuKE was "GIANT," but I think
that before people write to just get their names in places they should
understand the subject that they are writing on.  Second of all, NuKE
has only a few "not so great" viruses out, there are no screw-ups trying
to make shitty viruses in NuKE, doesn't look like this guy knows anything
about viruses.
