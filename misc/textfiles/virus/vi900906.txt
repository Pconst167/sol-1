 <ST>Hey, what happened to connecting my system to the file echo?
 <ST>
 <ST>I have sent numerous netmail messages to you since you sent the info 
 <ST>on setting it up and have not had a reply yet.

Recheck your netmail, I sent a reply after receiving the message "What is 
Tick?" indicating that you need to be running Tick in order to be able to 
participate in the file echo since that is how the files are processed and 
extra files go with the .zip files that carry the description.  Tick is 
available from most SDS nodes.

Jim... this is a little mis-leading... all programs will become infected 
but FSHLD will remove it for most viruses.. for viruses like 4096, FSHLD 
won't remove or even know/announce that the file is infected...
 
When FSHLD can remove a virus, 'after execution but before running' 
really makes no difference since a resident virus will still go TSR and 
a direct action virus will still do it's infecting of other programs...
 
But all things considered...  I definately agree that FSHLD is a must 
have...

yes, it is possible to re-map the keyboard from a remote system.  However, most
people are protected by this because the term program rather than ANSI.SYS is 
handling the ANSI escape sequences.

If you are using a "dumb" terminal that has no terminal emulation and allowing 
ANSI.SYS to handle your screen formatting, you may be in trouble.

QUOTE ON

I've been informed by "reliable sources" that there's a file floating around
called 486COMP.* (select your favourite packing method) which claims to "show 
you the difference between your machine and a 486".
.
When run, the program flashes a "too big for memory" message, and aborts.
.
Then, the next time you boot, you're informed that you have the "Leprosy 1.00" 
virus which then hangs the machine.
.
After you manage to boot from a floppy, you find that COMMAND.COM has been 
altered, although the date, time, and size appear not to have been changed.

Just thought you'd like to know.

Cheers!

I can correct this when it happens by hitting the left hand shift key - but not
the right.  And tonight it seems as if I am occaissionaly transposing caps on

Subj: REMAPPING...
Hello, Tom...
.
      More than likely there was nothing like that at all. Keyboard
remapping is an extremely complicated process and would take more than
forethought on the part of the programmer. What you have seen us
talking about here is figurative at best and personally, I would have
to see it to believe it. (you know the old saying: "Believe none of
what you hear and only half of of what you see."?) Although I do
believe that is quite possible under the proper circumstances, it would
indeed be a rare occurance. Sometimes when receiving odd characters
during telecommunications or not getting the exact same keys that you
typed could be attributed to disparity (parity differences), differing
data bits, stop bits, or even simply ANSI interpretation problems
between Comm Programs. I've seen the smallest, simplest things like
that have people pulling their hair out by the roots!

    I took a look at it, but to be realistic, when you run a BBS, or are 
continuously updating your files as new releases come out, you could easily get
to the point where you spend more time reconfiguring the anti-virus program 
than you would getting any work done. I find it much more efficient to scan 
every file for viruses as soon as I get it on my system, then rezip it, if I'm 
not going to use it... a simple .bat file can be used such that if you want to 
check multiple files, you can just feed the file names on the command line and 
let the .bat file take care of unzipping, scanning and rezipping the file.
    Be best if someone would write a program that would do this, but I haven't 
found one yet.

I think most of the "FAST" ansi replacements do not have the keyboard remapping

Subj: VIRUS RESCUE & F-PROT RELEASES
The latest version of Fridrik Skulason's F-PROT anti-viral program is now 
available for download from my system as FPROT112.ZIP.  The program can also be
file requested as F-PROT, which will always return the latest copy I have 
available.  This program is actually a "suite" of programs for use in 
preventing and detecting viruses and trojans.  The program originates in 
Iceland, and so updates to it reaching my system for distribution have been 
rather sporatic.  

The other new anti-viral program available on my system is Virus Rescue.  Virus
Rescue is from Tacoma Software, and is a shell for invoking ViruScan, CleanUp, 
and VCopy from McAfee Associates.  Unlike other shell programs I've seen, this 
one should not require updates every time a new release of Scan comes out.  It 
picks up its virus information from the VIRLIST.TXT file which is packaged with
Scan and CleanUp.  It will be handy for those who have trouble with the Scan 
and CleanUp command line switches, or who want the VIRLIST.TXT information 
converted to english sentences.  This is a first public release, so I expect we
may see some changes in this product in the future.  Virus Rescue can be 
downloaded from my system as RESQ01.ZIP.

Both programs are also file requestable by other systems.  File requests should
ask for magic file names as follows:

        F-PROT for the latest copy of F-PROT (currently FPROT112.ZIP)
        RESCUE for the latest version of Virus Rescue

sounds like a plan to me. it would actually be fairly simple to write a
program to look at all the files in your upload directory, unpack them based
on the extension, scan them, then re-compress them (if needed). of course
you'd still have to manually put the now scanned files into the proper
catagory directories yourself. when do you need it and what's it worth? :-)

No, it just modifies the partition record to remove the virus.
If the virus isn't there, it still modifies the partition
record. Return.com just reverses the modifications done to the

(All answers gratefully received despite the TO: line)
   Anybody heard of this? I've got a floppy with some viruses on it, 
among them a SCAN-known Dark Avenger. I SCAN this floppy from the C 
drive, and the "hey, nothing to worry about there" report comes back. 
Strange. I SCAN it again. This time 'round, SCAN barfs after 64K of 
the memory check, telling me Dark Avenger is in memory, power down, 
load the .45, get the cyanide tablet ready and so on.
   But DA of course is NOT in memory or active in any way. It is, 
however, on the floppy, unrun.
   The above occurred with SCANV64. Out of curiosity, I cranked up 
SCAN-54 and -- EXACTLY the same result.
   AST Bravo 286, no TSRs, nothing else loaded, clean (normal) boot 
just performed.
   I have a bunch of viruses that I don't expect SCAN to find -- 
ever. But this kind of thing has never happened to me before. Can 
anyone match this story, or event?

 PL> Supposedly the Virus is scanned in version SCANV66.ZIP.

Yep, I've heard of this one....I was the one that named it after it was 
submitted by Mike Shields (Sysop of 1:244/114).  Ontario is a memory resident 
generic infector of .COM and .EXE files, including COMMAND.COM.  Infected .COM 
files will increase in length by 512 bytes.  Infected .EXE files will increase 
in length between 512 bytes and 1023 bytes on disk drives with standard 512 
byte sectors.  When files are infected, the virus adds itself to the end of the
program, and then places a jump at the beginning so that the virus's code will 
always execute before the program that was infected.  Ontario is not a 
low-system memory TSR, it goes memory resident installing itself at the top of 
free memory, but below the 640K line.  Available free memory will decrease by 
2,048 bytes.  Once the virus has installed itself in memory, any program which 
is executed will then become infected.  

It was reported with the sample I received from Mike that infected systems may 
experience hard disk errors, but I was unable to duplicate that here.  This may
only happen in severe infections, I try not to let them get that severe when 
I'm working with a virus :-).  

Scan V66 and above can detect the Ontario Virus on both .COM and .EXE files. 
Unfortunately, Ontario is one of the viruses that uses a "double-encryption" 
technique to prevent scanners from being able to use a search string to detect 
it, so there isn't a simple way to find it with a hex string and a utility such
as Norton Utilities.  As of right now, there aren't any disinfectors available 
for the Ontario virus, so if you happen to be infected with it you need to 
remove the infected programs and replace them with clean copies from your 
uninfected backups or original write-protected distribution diskettes.  

A more complete description of the Ontario virus is in VSUM9008, which was 
released on August 10.  The above is just off of the top of my head, which 
happens to hurt right now.  Hope it is understandable.....

Well, the two oldest known viruses for MS-DOS are the Pakistani Brain and

originated in 1986.  Both have known authors.  The viruses from 1987 include

You might want to take a look at CheckOut and Shez.  

CheckOut uses ViruScan to check .ARC, .PAK, .ZIP, .LZH, and other archive 
formats for viruses by automatically creating a temporary directory and 
unarchiving the file to it.  It then invokes Scan to check the executable 
files.  One of its nice features is that it will never invoke a program in that
temporary directory, as well as you can have it either delete an infected file 
or move it to a badfiles directory.  It will also find archives which are 
damaged for you.  It can be invoked easily from a .BAT file, such as if you 
want to run it at midnight against all new uploads.  

Shez is another program which can be used to scan inside archives.  It is 
interactive, so you need to manually invoke it.  After you have selected the 
archive and listed the contents, hitting ctrl-Z will result in Scan checking 
the contents.  

There are other scanning shells which handle archived files, though these are 
the two that I've used regularly and are the most familiar with.  I was also 
involved in the beta testing of CheckOut with some known to be infected files, 
and it does function properly in that instance.  I've also tested Shez with 
infected files, and it works well....

In your recent letter to me you wrote to me you suggested that I check for the 
virus before trying to remove it. Now that I've got a working copy of the Joshi
(and don't have to let someone else test RMJOSHI), I rewrote the program to 
check for the virus first.

I wrote it for the shareware A86, but it should assemble under MASM, TASM or

because the remover won't work while the virus is active in memory....<MM>.

Patti, I sent you a message the other day about a new variant of
"Stoned" that I found in Christchurch, New Zealand.  It had reference
to some "S & S program for testing anti-virus software" and the
phone number  0494 791900 in it.

I have since had the time to pull it to bits, and it is only the
original "Stoned" virus.  The code at the start of the sector is
still the same, but some clown has modified the message after
location 65H.

I'm still pleased to send you a specimen by airmail if you like,
but it ain't "Stoned 2".

     In examples of the VACSINA virus I have investigated, I have found the 
following odd behavior, which I wonder if you have also noted :

     .COM files of over a certain size are infected at first bite, but .EXE 
files are different. It takes two Exposures to infect an .EXE file, each of 
which adds a bit to the file length, but only at the second exposure do you get
a live virus, signaled by a short beep. A tiny .EXE will take the first 
exposure, but never complete on a subsequent exposure to become a live virus. 
     I wonder if in some way this behavior, which I have not seen in any other 
viruses so far, is in some way related to the original "anti-virus" nature of 
this beast ?

could you send me this article? i still believe that the virus would have to
know your crc algorithm in order to perform this magic. additionally if the
file is padded, it's size would increase and would be detected that way.
correct? sooo, the person writting the virus would require a copy of your
file to disassemble, see how you performed your checks, then create a means
to circumvent it. sounds like a lot of trouble to me for very little gain.
catch ya on the rebound.

Subj: VIRUS_INFO INTRODUCTION & RULES
Welcome to the VIRUS_INFO echo.  The purpose of this echo is to allow
BBS users and sysops to ask questions about computer viruses and to be
able to get back up-to-date information.  Discussion topics may include,
but is not necessarily limited to:

    - what are viruses
    - how to prevent getting infected
    - how to determine if your system is infected
    - how to clean up an infected system and salvage as much information
      as possible
    - reviews and announcements of new anti-viral products and product
      releases.

There was a lot of hysteria in the press over the Columbus Day/
DataCrime/October 12 virus, for example, but little mentioned of how
rare the virus is or how to determine if a system is infected with it
and how to remove it.  This type of information is an example of what
this echo is intended to carry.

Some messages appearing in this conference may be cross-postings from
the Dirty_Dozen echo which is sysop only.  Cross-postings may only be
done by the originator of the message.  For example, several of my
messages posted in the Dirty_Dozen echo will be cross-posted here.
Messages from the HomeBase/CVIA BBS run by Mr. John McAfee in Santa
Clara, CA and/or CVIA bulletins may be posted here by Patricia Hoffman,
these are being done with Mr. McAfee's permission.  Replies to these
messages, as well as netmail received at 1:204/869 for Mr. McAfee, is
manually transferred to his system as it is received.

Conference rules are very simple.....
1.   Discussions of how to write a virus, specific technical discussions
     of how a virus works, or anything of an illegal nature, are not 
     allowed.  This rule is *not* open to debate.
2.   Messages with a sexually suggestive nature are not allowed, please keep
     in mind that minors as well as adults participate in this conference.
3.   Discussions of a ethical or retorical nature that lead into a debate are
     considered off-topic in that they will not ever be resolved and do not
     help anyone.  An example in this category would be a discussion in the
     area of "Should live viruses or virus disassemblies be made available 
     to the public?".  These questions and topics will be allowed until such
     a point that they start to severely disrupt the echo, or start a flame
     war.  At that point, the moderator will request that the discussion be
     discontinued.
4.   Be courteous to your fellow echo participants, and remember there
     is no such thing as a dumb question, except for the question that some-
     one is afraid to ask.  Everyone needs to help everyone else understand
     viruses and why they are a problem.
5.   This conference is not to be distributed thru Group-mail or any
     other mail processor which will obscure the ability to track a
     message back to an originating system.  All messages must have
     seen-bys and path statements if the BBSs participatings software
     can generate them.
6.   If you have a question or problem of an extremely sensitive nature,
     consider sending it NetMail to 1:204/869 or 99:9403/2 instead of
     posting it here.  If you are netmailing a file that you think is
     infected, be sure to send a message in NetMail with it so I know
     what it is, I'll be sure it gets to someone to get analysed for you.
     Do not under any circumstances host route a file that you think is
     infected.  Suspect files may also be sent on diskette via US Mail
     to the following address:
          Patricia Hoffman
          1556 Halford Avenue #127
          Santa Clara, CA 95051
7.   This conference is available to FidoNet and EggNet systems.
     The conference echomail tag in FidoNet is VIRUS_INFO, in EggNet 
     the conference is available as E_VIRUS_INFO.
8.   This conference is available on the FidoNet Backbone.  While you 
     are welcome to freely pass this echo along to other systems, out
     of region links must be approved by moderator of the echo.  Gating
     the echo into another network or Zone must be approved by the
     conference moderator.
9.   Opinions are welcome in the conference, however the ethics of the
     behavior of people that write viruses, or name calling, is frowned
     upon.  Likewise, accusations of virus writing are strictly forbidden.
     Please keep opinions down to a single message, and do not
     repeatedly post them, as these messages tend to water down the
     purpose of the conference and degrade the level of information that
     is being presented.
10.  Handling of off-topic messages or messages that violate the
     conference rules will be done by the moderator.  First and second
     warnings on these messages will be in private Netmail.  Please
     do not respond to the off-topic messages so that the conference
     doesn't get further off-track.  Let the moderator do the moderating.
11.  Handles are allowed in this conference, however sysops of boards
     carrying the conference are expected to be able to determine which
     of their users entered a message if a problem arises.  This in
     effect means, for example, that Opus systems must not set this echo
     up to allow anonymous messages.
12.  If a matter arises where the moderator needs to contact a participant
     in the echo, the moderator will contact the system where the message
     was entered and request that the sysop allow the user netmail access,
     or call the participant with a request for them to logon to the
     moderator's system or provide a phone number with the participant's
     permission.  Sysops are not expected to provide their users' phone
     numbers to the moderator without the user's express permission, their
     privacy is important.  There are times, however, when a phone call
     or chat can resolve a problem much faster than any other route.  This is
     the only reason for this rule.
12.  This echo is not a programming echo for answering questions 
     on how to code programs in assembler.  If you want to exchange
     assembler (or any other program language) techniques, please
     locate an appropriate programming echo or start your own echo.  

Patricia M. Hoffman is the moderator of the VIRUS_INFO echo conference.  She
has previously used the name "Merry Hughes" in moderating this conference, and
is the originator of the conference and the original moderator.

Patricia Hoffman is also the author of the Virus Information Summary List, and
is an independent anti-viral researcher.

Please contact the moderator, Patricia Hoffman, at 1:204/869 or 99:9403/2
if you need assistance on setting up an echofeed for this echo to your
system.


thanks...

The Leprosy virus is a non-resident overwriting virus.  It infects .COM and 
.EXE files, overwriting the first 666 bytes of the file.  Symptoms of it 
include that infected files will not execute properly...instead of what they 
are supposed to do, they will upon execution, infect other files then display a
message and end.  A complete description of this virus and all (with the 
exception of V2P2, V2P6, V2P6 and Stoned II) known MS-DOS viruses as of August 
10, 1990 is available in the Virus Information Summary List.  Its current 
version is VSUM9008.ZIP.  It is available on my system at 408-244-0813, as well
as many other systems, including McAfee's BBS.  Check around your area before 
you make the long distance call, it could save you the phone call cost.

Yea, I think Mike was the one the message came from I read about.  He Was 
instrumental in helping us with another problem he found, too.  I am sure that 
he is on the up and up about the hard disk problems.  Nope, I don't have the 
Ontario Virus that I know of!  I read about the Virus after I had posted to 
you,  Thanx for the info.  Nice to know where it loads in Mem, that would make 
a util easier to write once I had a fix on what you have already told me.

I will see if I can locate that message from Mike about the Virus originally 
and let you read it...

Subj: REPLY TO MSG# 2753 (Re: VIRUS ORIGINALS)
Firstly, I did not wish to anger you (although I seem to have done just this), 
but only sought to answer your question to the best of my abilities (which you 
seem to doubt).

Secondly, I stand by my original assertions that viruses were developed through
the original Core Wars gaming system. This has been corroborated by various 
'virus gurus' here at the local university. In fact, without prompting, one 
mentioned Bell Labs. Since, as you state, you are a Systems Programmer - it 
should be obvious to yourself that a RedCode program could be easily adapted to
the microcomputer world. It should also be equally as obvious that these 
RedCode experiments have laid the groundwork for many of the various virus 
types infecting micros today (ie. trojans, worms, etc.).
 
Thirdly, I did not state, nor did I mean to imply (as you seem to believe), 
that these RedCode 'fighter programs' are in fact the viruses we see today - 
merely that they (RedCode fighters) provided the techniques for the micro 
viruses. Furthermore, since the RedCode experiments were "old system 
programmers games designed to give Egoistical programmers some lighthearted 
fun", and since it is generally accepted that virus writers are in this for the
same reasons (the egotistical, not the fun), I find it hard to beleive that you
cannot equate the two.

If you will note in the extract below, I am not the only person who who 
beleives the RedCode experiments were the forerunners of the modern viruses (in
fact, it may be noted they refer to these as viruses - which, of course, they 
were);


From the Sept./89 issue of Popular Science;
 
Despite all the recent publicity, viruses aren't new. In the 1950's researchers
studied programs the called "self-altering automata," says Mike Holm...
 
In the 1960s computer scientists at Bell Laboratories had viruses battling each
other in a game called Core Wars. The object was to create a virus small enough
to destroy other viruses without being caught....


Also, just for the record, allow me to mention that this is an American 
publication (apparently there are strange drugs down there too).
 
Again, for the record, allow me to mention that it is fact that Robert Morris, 
Sr. was a participant in the Core Wars games. Is it a coincidence that his son 
wrote the Internet Virus, or did his father give him the building blocks to 
build upon? (With my apologies to the Morris family, but I felt this example 
might carry some weight with Know-it-all System Programmers).

To answer your original question, in a form that you may deem acceptable (ie. 
no RedCode, no mainframe systems, the US is not the origin - all those naive 
things), the original micro virus was (at least in the IBM world, I can not be 
sure this applies to early Apple ][ systems, or even the Pets from Commodore) 
the "Pakistani Brain", released in Jan. '86.
 
But it must be noted (although I feel you will reject this also (ie. mainframe,
US, etc)), in Nov. '83, Fred Cohen, in 8 hours wrote a virus which attached 
itself to users programs, and proceeded to use this program to gain access to 
all system rights (in an average time of 30 mins). Also, although I don't have 
a date (the computer name itself may give some indication of age) - on a UNIVAC
1108, with a secure operating system using the Bell-Lapadula model for OS 
security, a virus was created that: infected the system in 26 hours, used only 
legitimate activity with the Bell-Lapadula rules, and the infection took only 
250 (approx.) of code (From "Computer Security: Are Viruses the AIDS of the 
Computing Industry?", by Prof. Wayne Patterson, Chairman, Dept. of Computer 
Science, University of New Orleans.).

I am not interested in a war of words, so I will suggest some reading before 
you go off half cocked to this reply - "Computer Security; A Global Challenge,"
J.W. Finch & E.G. Douglas, eds., Elsevier Science Publishers, North-Holland - 
especially the chapters by Fred Cohen. I have not read this, but will try to 
when it becomes available to me. Also see the message posted by Phillip Laird.

 AD> anyone match this story, or event?

There are a couple of possibilities here.  First, if the virus is on a 
non-executable file, such as one with a .VOM or .VXE extension, Scan won't find
it since it is not one of the file extensions it checks for Dark Avenger.  In 
this case, a subsequent run of Scan may find it in memory anyways since the DOS
buffers in memory are not cleaned out between program executions.  If this is 
the case, running Scan with the /A option will find it on any file, regardless 
of extension.

Likewise, if your copy of Dark Avenger has ever had a disinfector run against 
it, it may have some "dead" Dark Avenger code after the end of file mark, but 
within the last sector of the program as allocated on disk.  In this case, Scan
won't find it on disk, but may later find it in memory since the code after the
end of file mark was read in with the rest of the last sector of the program to
memory.  This is what is sometimes referred to as a "ghost virus", it isn't 
really the virus, just dead remnant code remaining in the slack space in the 
sector.  It can't be executed.  Running a disk optimization utility such as 
Speed Disk from Norton Utilities will get rid of the "ghost virus".  They are 
caused by the way DOS fills out the end of the buffer before it writes it out 
to disk, doesn't always occur when disinfecting programs, but it sometimes will
occur.

The other case is if your copy of Dark Avenger does not occur at the correct 
place in the file.  Dark Avenger always adds its code to the End Of Programs. 
If your copy happens to have it at the beginning of the program, or perhaps 
imbedded in the middle where it shouldn't be, it may not get found.  In this 
case, your copy doesn't match either of the Dark Avenger's that McAfee has.  

Hope that helps....those are the only three cases that I've heard of a similar 
problem to yours.  

Patti

I had heard that and infected version of LHARC was released last year under the

was expected to be LHARC200 to avoid confustion with the virus.  This week a 
file appeared on a local board called LHARC114.  I left a message to the sysop 
to check it out and he says it's clean.  The docs say that this is version 
114b, the latest version.

Does anybody know what the deal is or was here?  Is LHARC114 safe to use?  Is 
there a virus associated with this program?  Thanks.

 Hi there, you guys must be behind the times or something but there is a very 
good program which does exactly what you are looking for. Its called CHECKOUT. 
The version we are using over here is called CKOT11.ZIP and it is a little 
pearler!!

  What it does is, unzips a file, scans it and rezips it, menu driven or 
command line driven. Try it, you'll love it.

The following item appeared in a newspaper in Brisbane, Austsralia yesterday.
Anyone care to comment?

VIRUS ATTACKS STATE'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS

A sophisticated computer virus is feared to have infected Queensland Government
and home computers.   The COMPUTER VIRUS INFORMATION GROUP at the QUEENSLAND 
UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY has issued it first major warning to personal computer
users about the virus.

The virus, initially detected by the Israeli defence force, freezes computers 
on September 22, the birthday of a character in Tolkien's book, 'Lord of the 
Rings'.

A computer virus is a program designed to attach copies of itself to software 
and disable a computer system, or destroy files.   Acting technologist, MR 
EMLYN CREEVY said the warning was issued after a State Government public 
servant gave the virus to the group for investigation.

Mr Creevy said somputers infected with the virus - known as FRODO, 4096, or 
CENTURY - would freeze on September 22 or until the end of the year unless it 
was removed.    He said the group expected to know if the virus had infected 
computers in Queensland next week after users report the results of searches 
they were requested to conduct.   The group warned all personal computer 
operators that there was a bug in the FRODO virus which prevented it from 
displaying a message 'FRODO LIVES' on September 22 and instead caused the 
computer to 'hang' or freeze.

"It is from the FRODO name that the significance of the 22nd September can be 
identified," they said.    "This is the birthday of Frodo Baggins in Tolkien's 
story.    Users are advised to theck for the virus as soon as possible.

Mr Creevy said the virus had the ability to avoid detection and spread but was 
not 'seriously destructive'.   He said it could become damaging if an expert 
could disassemble the virus and change the instructions to wipe the computer's 
disk.   "I'd say there's people working on it somewhere although probably not 
in Australia," Mr Creevy said.

An expert would have created the Frodo virus because it had only one bug while 
most viruses had more.

Mr Creevy said more than 100 viruses were believed to exist worldwide.

well close... without discussing HOW its done... the file length is
altered back to the original length... its not that hard and does point
out one of the MAJOR problesm with crc scanners...that is that the
critical information that tells the operating system how long the file
is can be altered at will... as far as the comments of a virus author
disassembling the CRC package its commonly done during product testing
to find out ahead of time what algorithms are in use by the product...
it really depends on the level of security one wants for ones PC...
I really wouldnt put it past a good virus author to specifically
target anti-viral programs in this fashion... as far as disassemblies
being hard... well I do an average of 5-6 per day with files ranging in
size from 2k to 90k(although I will admit that some of the trickier
ones do cause head scratching occasionally...) note that i said
programs and not specifically viruses...

Tom,
    without adding too much fuel to any fire... certain
non-communication programs are susceptible to the ANSI programmable
attack... on my end I run no program that implements ANSI3.64
terminal control language without having a way to turn thoses "FEATURES
" off... certain programs without mentioning brand names do allow
this. if the echo moderator allows I will post a list of good and bad
programs in this regard... so that you can all protect yourselves
better...(n.b. after being chewed out by the moderator I am
constraining my comments carefully...)
   cheers
   sandyp.s. these attacks have been common since programmable
terminals came into being during the middle 1970's the problem is that
when these features were implemented in comm programs the possibility
arose that it was possible for malicious individuals to finally do some
real damage...the way to protect yourself is to STOP using programs
that implement such features and switch to others that are more secure
in their usage of such features...

Ontario loads into the top of free memory, right below the 640K boundary.  It

Subj: FLOPPY MBR BACKUP
I had originally posted this question to the moderator, but after a
little thought decided that I would be sure to receive a myriad of
answers from the ECHO participants if asking the question here,
also.....
      It is simply this:
 Does anyone have any decent (and simple) suggestions for extraction of
the floppy MBR???.....There are several very good utilities in the
public domain for strictly Hard Drive Boot Sector (ie. ST0) and other
utilities contained within, say for instance, PCTools, that can back-up
the HARD Drive Partition Table (I forgot to mention several PD programs
to back-up the FAT).....But, almost all of these that I have seen
pertain to the HDU! I realize that there are ways to write it to a file
using certain SPY-type programs, but what I am really interested in is
a simplified program that is easy to use at the lowest end of the USER
pyramid
   
  -Thanks in advance for your suggestions and assistance.....
    
    
  -Paul  ^@@^.........

Subj: POSSIBLE VIRUS?

This just hit me today - I am not sure if it is some kind of system error or a 
potential virus.

Last night (September first) and before gave me no indication of any virus 
being present on my system. It is now september 1st and now, whenever a file is
written to disk (I noticed the text files first, but a downloaded zip'd file 
was also garbled...) it took out about 10 bytes from the beginning of each 
line...

When I realized this may be set to occur on this date, I set my DATE back a 
night and everything worked fine... I made a sample text file with a known 
pattern of characters -- any date past september 1st 1990 leaves the file 
altered as mentioned above. Any date previous is written unharmed...

SCANV56 reports only that the SCAN program is damaged - no disk presence of the
source is evident.

Has anyone heard of something like this happening?

   I have a copy of the Leprosy virus along with its source and

each time it is run and produces a memory error code so the user thinks 
there is a problem with memory and runs it again. After all the com and 
exe files have been infected, it displays a message that they have a 
virus and "Good luck!"...   It increases file sizes by 666 but when I 
tested it on a floppy, the bytes didn't increase...

I am a Private contractor for a Large Network installation an support company.
I work for the good of the Customer and the population (users). 

I hear the phrase " SLIMY CONTRACTOR" " M.F.C." everyday. I also heard 
"Can this be done", "Would you look into this...", "What are your suggestions 
so I can put them in my report" when things get deep. We are the WHIPPING BOYS 
and EMERGENCY 911 all in one.

I am sure there are Software contractors who have planted or released a virus 
at contract renewal time. To show how much they are needed.
There are also those of us the that want to see their job sites safe from such 
problems. We are the ones who own our time (Non-Paid) Compile information
on ways to safe guard our data from compermise or viral attacks. 

The Anti-Viral reseach done by Mrs. Hoffman (PAT)  and John McAfees group 
is carefully read and evaluated on my end. I am sure it has saved many a rear
from a bear trap.

Subj: SECURING YOUR UPLOADS
    I've got checkout, and while its a pretty neat program, there are a few 
things I don't like about it, the main one being the initial memory scan. I 
also don't like the auto-pause that seems to be at the beginning of it. That 
means running gateway, which means the user may be able to get into DOS and 
party. (have heard of Key-fake, but never seen it around to play with it..).
    TAG calls a file named postul.bat after every upload (if the .bat file is 
present), so I hacked up this .bat file to auto-check for virii. But I'm not 
smart enough to know how to use the %%f in a batch file to have it run through 
for all the files in the active directory (for batch uploads)...
    Maybe there's a genius out there who can help. FYI the parameters passed to
the .bat file are: [Baud] [ComPort] [User#] [U/L Dir] [Filename].

Here it is. Chuckle, then help make it better <grin>.

Also, I have a program that will make a .com fil out of a .bat file, for faster

about after the %%f is added?

   I have a copy, and think it came out around March, or so.  At the time, 
SCANV detected no virus, but I thought better of running it.

   Sorry, folks.  Whatever it is, it isn't available for downloading, so please

You are correct.....What the CRC/Checksum interrogator sees, if 4096 is in
memory, is the disinfected version of the program in memory, not what is
actually out on disk.  Fish 6 also does this, as do a couple of other viruses
using Stealth techniques.

Lots of 4096 infected files will run without hanging the system....the virus
disinfects the program when it is read into memory so that anti-viral packages
can't find the virus as easily.  CRC checkers and scanners won't be able to
find it in the infected file if the virus is in memory, in fact, these viruses
usually infect on file open as well as execute.  Run a CRC checker or Scanner
that doesn't check memory for the virus with it present and you'll infect
everything that is openned that meets its infection criteria.

If the virus isn't in memory, the CRC checker technique will work to identify
the infected files in 99% of the cases.  I'm not going to say 100% because I
believe some of the 512 virus variants can get around it due to the way it
attaches to the files in some cases, but not all.  Some CRC checkers don't
actually CRC the entire file either....and as soon as I state it is a fool
proof way of doing it, someone will write a virus that gets around it
perfectly in all cases.

I seem to be missing something here.  As I understand it, to check for virii 
with a scanner, such as SCAN, or whatever, you boot from a uninfected floppy 
that has scan residing on it.  Ok, now, how would a virus that works as a TSR, 
that probably is loaded from the boot sector from the hard disk be loaded, if 
you are booting from the floppy?  Which, the floppy being write protected, of 
course, would not have this viral infection.  I was under the assumption that 
the BIOS first checked drive A: at bootup for a disk, etc.  It seems that it 
would be impossible to find a virii in memory with this type of scheme.. Please
enlighten me..

Hear, hear! The frustrating, rug-chewing, desk-beating,

viruses, on a technical level, are tremendously slick, wonderous 
programs. The people writing them are wonderful programmers. Just

writing a different kind of program -- and, potentially, how much

Sure. Something ELSE has infected it. No reason not to let it run so 
long as it still works. One of our local youngsters wrote a wonderful 
remover of the Dark Avenger -- about 1400 bytes and worked like a 
charm. Only one teensy-weensy trouble -- the remover got infected and 
didn't warn you. That's not really one of the more useful programs to 
have around.
   Since it seems to be the constant topic of conversation here, 
SCANV's routine of warning of infection and continuing its duties is 
great.
   A common cause of re-infection is forgetting to remove the tools 
you used in the disinfection process -- stuff like LIST, just for 
example, that you might have used to examine the virus.

No, in a metaphor placed in 1970 terms, we get to the airport two 
hours before flight time for the security checks. And for the same 
reason, too -- the unwillingness of the many to take the resolve to 
remove the few. We have, most of us, helped the virus writers build 
up their existing sick belief that we are willing participants in 
some kind of game here. They win if they manage to steal our time, 
programs, disk space and data. They only do it because they had an 
unhappy childhood, right?
   One tangible result of allowing them to feed on this warped view 
is this echo, where we're all trying to get to the airport two hours 
early for the security check -- AND WE'RE ALL WASTING TWO HOURS 
because somebody we don't know might try to hurt us.
   We should have sympathy for Robert Morris, of course, because 
after all, he was just experimenting and not REALLY trying to hurt 
anyone, right? I have a one-word, two-syllable response to that but 
FidoNet policy frowns down upon me for thinking of using it.

clients think of as commercial software simply isn't up to this 
standard -- isn't meant to be; never was; probably never will be.
   Seems to me if your clients like the SCANV concept, you should 
explain to them why they should be using SCANV. Why reinvent the 
wheel?
   If it wasn't that commercial messages which mention something 
other than SCANV often seem to get flamed here, I'd tell you about my 
commercial, non-BBS, wholly generic virus detector that doesn't need 
upgrading, which is available in North America and which soon will be 
launched there. But I don't want to get flamed, so I won't.

Roger that. A program (such as a virus) can possibly figure out a 
checksum or CRC and "fool" your checker. But complex and random 
checksumming or CRCing is beyond the real-world possibility of defeat 
by a PC virus -- it would have to be too big and complex itself.
   Our strategy on our anti-virus program is to have eight different 
algorithms, and to use two of them on each checksum pass. Which two, 
even we do not know. Your virus then would have to take into account 
64 reasonably complex algorithmic possibilities to defeat it.
   Patti is technically correct that this can be done -- but not in 
the real world. I'd tend to be slightly suspicious if my word 
processor suddenly grew by the size of THIS virus. Most programs 
would, in fact, be incapable of loading it.
   As you say -- make it complex (which isn't so difficult) and keep 
churning out hundreds of different algorithms. Then you can forget 
about "stealth" viruses succeeding.

This is absolutely correct, of course, and EXACTLY what's recommended 
in the doc. I was just curious whether others had had the experience. 
I do do some experimenting with viruses and anti-virus stuff, because 
Bangkok's a "virus capital" (dumb dealers plus a whole raft of 
pirates) and because I'm involved in a commercial anti-virus project. 
This was just a weird thing that happened to me when I was "playing" 
with Dark Avenger. I do wonder how many people follow that 
"write-protected floppy" recommendation (order???) in the SCAN docs, 
though.
   One note on your comment: it might be hard for some people to 
follow the recommendation, i.e. those with one floppy. The total 
beauty of SCAN, really, is to look over that new stuff. A lot of 
machines go to new people with one floppy drive. 
   A lot also go with two different floppy drives (my own setup) 
although this of course is combatted simply by having TWO 
write-protected diskettes with SCAN aboard.

Setting the "Read-only" attribute wouldn't even *phase* a decent virus, and
SCAN's internal checksum is VERY weak.  (It quite literally is a checksum.
It simply checks to see if all the words in the files add up to 0.)

 HB> enlighten me..

The memory resident viruses that are a real problem when they are in memory and
any antiviral, whether a scanner or CRC checker, is run are not boot sector 
infectors....4096, Fish-6, Dark Avenger, and many others which infect on file 
open are file infectors.  There are three that are file infectors but can also 
infect and replicate from the partition table and/or boot sector: V2100, 
Anthrax, and Plastique 5.21.  (These last three are extremely rare, fairly new,
and not known in the United States.)  All of the viruses mentioned about use 
"Stealth" techniques to avoid detection or infect on file open.  

If you are booting from an uninfected diskette when powering on the computer, 
you wouldn't ever find a virus in memory.  However, if you are performing a 
warm reboot from a floppy, you could have a virus in memory still.  The real 
point here was that most people do not run scan or other anti-viral utilities 
after powering on and booting from a floppy, so it is always possible for the 
virus to be in memory.  

In that particular case, for a CRC checker which is what was being discussed, 
there are definite cases (the "Stealth" viruses) where the virus can get around
the CRC checker simply because if the virus is in memory it disinfects the 
infected programs as they are read into memory.  The CRC checker, since it is 
performing file reads, reads the DOS buffers to check the program, so the 
program it sees isn't infected and isn't the same as what is actually on the 
disk.  In the case of viruses that infect on file open, running an anti-viral 
product against all the programs on a system with the virus active in memory 
can very well result in all the programs becoming infected.  

I'm not against CRC checkers, I use one all the time on several of my systems. 
These systems all have master boot diskettes with clean system files, the CRC 
checker, and the log of all the expected crc values to be returned.  Most 
people simply do not have that type of diskette setup for their systems since 
they feel they'll never be infected with a virus.  In fact, the probability 
that a person will be infected with a virus is fairly low, though it does 
change depending on the person's computing habits and how often they exchange 
diskettes and/or programs with others.  

I was trying to point out that NONE of the current anti-virals will absolutely 
protect a user from getting a virus....all the techniques currently used by 
anti-viral products can be circumvented by some of the newer, more 
technologically advanced viruses.  Not to point that out would be like burying 
one's head in the sand, especially when the discussion has to do with someone 
thinkin of writing a new anti-viral who needs to know what can currently be 
circumvented.  It is easier to fix the design before the program is written 
then to fix it later after the hole is found....

I totally agree that most people do not read the docs.  I work for a University

have setup a routine for the Labs to Scan the Floppies coming in with SCAN. 
This has just taken Place.  Next thing I know, the clerk decides to run SCAN 
From her hard drive on her desktop!  Then Alameda hit her!  The SCAN Program 
has gone over good at the University.  We are getting an order ready for a Site
License Agreement with MCafee and Associates.  I do a little research on some 
of the strains.  However this BBS keeps me busy after work!

Weird thing about CLEAN.EXE the program to remove the Viruses.  I am using 
Clean Version 66 and sometimes the program will scan the file numerous times 
before the virus is eventually removed.  I guess the Marker is trying to move 
around in the file?  Anybody know?

But will continue to operate. If you see that message then you're in big

Well, first of all you've got an old version of scan. Try downloading scanv66b 
from someone. I have it if you can't locate it elsewhere. Second if scan ever 
reports being damaged there's a 99% chance that you've got a virus! Better

  I have learned from other sources that the latest official release of LHARC 
is LH113D.  The 'new' LHARC114 is said to be another unauthorized hack.  It 
evidently is NOT a virus.  Yoshi has been quoted as stating on GENIE that the 
next official release will be ver. 2.0.  I hope this helps.

Subj: RE: MYSTERY VIRUS??
Could I ask wy the buffers would be causing the Boot Block to be altered.
 
I have since removed the val checks using ScanV66B and put some new ones on 
using ScanV66B.
 
Could it be possible that someone has altered a bit of the code and as ScanV66 
uses a string (or is it hex search) it doesn't find it? 
 
eg In the Virus it originaly said "Your disk is stoned' and the person 
converted it to say 'Your disk is now stoned'. If ScanV66 happens to look for 
the original string to my knowlegde the virus would not be recognized.

THat is exactly the way I have found some of the Virii I researched as being. 
If the virus is present in memory, then it is possible the the file will 
infect, however, if the Scan Diskette is write protected and the diskette is 
bootable, Like oyu say.  It is BEST to cut the power to the system and then 
re-boot the system.  However, if you wanted to go a step further, it is 
possible to clear all volatile RAM if you want to do a warm boot.  The Warm 
Boot can result in infection, since the ram is not cleared.  The various 
hardware interrupts are still performed and cotrol passed to Command.com, but 
the System files are still present in memory, along with a virus possibly.  Too
many people are now taking the virus issue too lightly.  It can effect you, 
take precaution and use the Floppy to boot up on with a Write Protect on the 
Diskette.  Then scan the drive from there.

That is exactly what I had suspected.  I assumed the file was re-infected 
several times as the size of the Original WP.EXE files that were infected once 
was for example 112K, and the ones that were infected several times was around 
173K.  Some of the programs were non functional after clean ws performed on the
file.  We just delte the file and re-copy it when that happens.  The only safe 
way to do it I have found is to go ahead anuse scans' /D option and delete the 
file and re-copy it.

 Backup your harddrive and reformat it, after restoring it.  Delete and redo

Well you can  Download a Virus scanner from a reputable BBS -- one that

Virus Scanner.  Most of the downloadable stuffis by Mcaffe Associates, You can 
purchase Virucide (commercial version) which checks and disinfects your files, 
also by Mcaffe Associates for about $30.00. Not a bad buy when you consider the
consequences of not having a good scanner.
 
Just make sure that after Downloading a file, unarc-unzip-unwhatever it, But 
under no circumstance activate it --- run it --.  Run the scanner, if the file 
checks clean go ahead and run it then.  If it dosn't the program will warn you 
and disinfect it.  The reason you must open the file (unzip) is because 
scanners can't look into an archived file.

Actually the Honor of creating Viruses Belongs to John Conway, he was trying to
develop software that emulated living organisms.  He developed the first "Game 
of Life".  As he created these new programs they became more and more complex 
having intricate enviroments that the elements would have to over come in order
to survive.
 
But these were never allowed to get beyond that scope, Virus programs where 
never destructive untill the "Core Wars".  Opposing Programmers would create 
self-replicating programms that when they encountered other self-replicaters 
would try to devour them.  Incidently it was called "Core Wars" because the 
game itself took place in Core Memory .  These young Programmers were actually 
quite small in number and never publicly discussed what they were doing.  If 
any blame is to be attached it should be to Ken THompson who went public with 
the process in 1983..... at that point it was "Discovered" by university 
students who began creatingthe real nasties ..... Today many strains are just 
variation of their original work.

that some of the students disks are being over written by the program disk they
were using. Eg some people have found the Turbo pascal files on their data 
disks.
 
I brought in a copy of ScanV66 and placed a validation check on the program 
disks (Not the data disks). Scanning showed no viruses (well known ones 
anyway). But when we scanned them a week later we found some had had their Boot
Blocks altered.
 
In some cases the files on the data disk are just renamed to one on the program
disk. Eg we listed "TURBO.EXE" and found it to contain a students pascal source
code.
 
Could someone shed some light please..
I have told the teacher it is most likely home grown and he is sh*tting

    Actually, I really should have said "virtually preconceived".
From what I can gather on the topic (I don't yet have a copy of 4096),
they actually redirect CRC/Checksum interrogators to a "snapshot" of
the original file as it appeared before infection.(Someone, I'm sure,
will correct me if I'm wrong or at least add enlightenment.)
The infected file, in the case of 4096, has in reality grown by 4096
bytes and would more than likely hang the system, therefore, which
would lead me to believe that running the CRC check without the virus
TSR would allow you to identify the actual infected files. Also, it
seems like the only way to catch it TSR is to trace the interrupt
vectors (although everyone seems to have a little bit of differing
ideas on this '->)
     Until I can get my hands on this little fellow, I guess that I'll
just follow the more logical explanations from the sources with
credibilty and make a judgement from that! Sounds credible. But, as I'v
said before-    I sure would like to see it.
   
      I've been following several different message base threads on
this particular virus, with input from users at the basic levels to BBS
SysOps to the AntiViral research community.......I must say, it gets
overwhelming at times to keep objective. *:)

Haven't seen or heard of that one before.... What does it infect?  .COM, .EXE, 
overlays, boot sectors, only floppies?  If you want to send me a copy of it, 
I'd be happy to take a look at it as well as pass it along to John McAfee's 
group.  Snail mail address is:

        Patricia M. Hoffman
        1556 Halford Avenue #127
        Santa Clara, CA  95051

It can also be sent in a .ZIP file to my system, though be sure you don't route
it thru anyone, or directly uploaded here to a suspect area that is secured.

Not off-topic at all, that is what this conference is for....

 PF>   1.) Would someone like to elaborateon the structure of "Phases" that
 PF>        the CVIA uses to catorgorize viruses? Please?    ;-)
 PF>    

VSUM doesn't necessarily use the McAfee or CVIA categorization techniques to 
classify viruses.  VSUM's categorization is a bit finer than McAfee's since in 
many cases he can group things together for detection/removal purposes. 
However, in describing them they don't make much sense that way.  I haven't 
seen a copy of the CVIA categorization in some time, but I believe they 
classified by:

        boot sector infector
        parasitic file infector
        overwriting file infector

Partition table infectors were (I think) thrown in with boot sector infectors 
since at the time the only partition table infector was Stoned, which also 
infected floppy boot sectors.  They also classified by memory resident or 
non-resident.  

Generally, VSUM classified by memory resident/non-resident, what it infects, 
file length change, symptoms, and other characteristics, as well as what virus 
the new entry is based on if applicable.  In the case of memory resident 
viruses, there is a code to indicate how or where it is memory resident.    

McAfee and I had a loooonnnnnggggg discussion on classification and naming 
awhile back, and "agreed we could disagree" since how he uses the names in Scan
isn't workable for VSUM, and using the VSUM naming in Scan would not serve his 
purposes since he needs to group variants in many cases.  If possible, though, 
we try to use the same names.  If VSUM differs, the name that will be indicated
by Scan is indicated as an alias.  McAfee's current classification methods as 
indicated in VIRLIST.TXT which comes out with Scan also differs from the CVIA 
classifications, and is fairly close to VSUM.

 PF>   2.) I seem to remember mention (No, I don't have my copy of VSUM in
 PF> front of my now) of the virus (4096) containing it's own boot sector.
 PF> Could someone enlighten me on this , also?
 PF>   

Yes, it includes a boot sector, though do to an error in the virus, the 
included boot sector isn't ever written to the hard disk or floppy boot sector.
This boot sector is where the "FRODO LIVES" message is....  

 PF>   3.) And, under what ? circumstances does the 'FRODO LIVES' msg.
 PF> appear and when does it not?
 PF>   

Normally, due to a bug in the virus, the message is never displayed.  If one 
copies the boot sector from within the 4096 virus to a floppy diskette as 
sector 0, and boots from it, the message will appear.  

Of course, the above bugs may be fixed in a later version of the virus....but 
the versions I've seen hang on September 22 when they were meant to activate 
the Frodo Lives message.  

 PF>    
 PF> No offense, Patti, but I did think that on a couple of these points
 PF> that the VSUM doc was kinda sketchy (I know that is ALOT of work to
 PF> compile that baby and continually update, etc.!). 
 PF>      Perhaps with a little more detail, I will have settled my
 PF> curiousity and returned to other problems at hand...
 PF>    

No problem....A lot of time what makes perfect sense to me doesn't make sense 
to others :-).  There is always this question with VSUM on where to draw the 
line on the descriptions.  

 PF> Patti- Any luck with last U/L?    ,-)
 PF> 

Not yet....I'm busy working on analysing a new virus right now, and it is going
to take awhile....will probably be a Whale of a tale when I get done....and I 
don't want to say anything prematurely on it.

Core Wars was a simulation system, it was not per se' a breeding ground for the
type of viri that you see today attacking systems and PCs.  The programs tested
were called viri in the way they attacked and behaved while operating
within the Core Wars environment.  I believe the "arena" used for the "viruses"
was an 8K memory grid, and that the programs/"viri" were limited to that area.

While those programs were not the same thing as what we see today chewing up 
our beloved computers, I can say that Core Wars was an extremely enlightening 
experience that had the programmers thinking about how a similiar type of 
situation could apply to the actual computing world.

This could happen (and has) if you are using disk caching software.  That would

be a good place to look first.
