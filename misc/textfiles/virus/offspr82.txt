  Yea yea here is Offspring v0.82 .. this really isn't a release which
  involved much change as far as coding goes. Mcafee's SCAN has been
  detecting this virus as 'Trident' which is obviously a complete
  screw up since this viruses encryption is not anything like TPE.
  Actually, SCANv107 adds 'OFFSpring' to it's list of detectable
  viruses. I don't know what version he got , but it doesn't detect
  any current version as [OFFS]. Regardless as what it detects as, I
  just couldn't live with one of my viruses being detected by his shitass
  scanner.   So new in this version is:

  v0.82 - No longer detectable by SCAN as anything.
          No longer detectable by TBAV heuristics.


  Type : PSRhA  - Parastic & Spawning Resident  - Encrypting
  Origin : Virogen's Drunken Programming Inc.
  Eff. Length : 1134-1184

  Infection Method :  Once memory resident, the virus infects up to five
                     files in the current directory everytime a file
                     is execucted. Anyway, it will first infect EXE files
                     (spawning) in directory, once all the EXE files have
                     been infected, it moves to COM files (parastic).



                                   Your Faithful Comrad,
                                           Virogen
