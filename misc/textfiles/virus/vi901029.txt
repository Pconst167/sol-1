It does not have to be a virus to cause this.  While creating files some 
programs assume that the diskette currently in the drive is the one that was 
started with.  One that comes to mind is SideKick.  I destroyed a few diskettes
before I realized the problem.  While using SideKick to edit a file on a 
diskette I popped it it down and forgot about the file.  Then I changed 
diskettes and continued to edit the file with SideKick.  I then saved the file 
forgetting about the diskette change.  The result was the files were still on 
the diskette but the directory belonged to the previous disk.  Since then I 
have encountered several other programs that can do this.

Doug, wouldn't it be feasible for you to change the archive bits to read only 
on the Scan File. Supposedly, Scan has a built in Mechanism for determining if 
it has been damged.  In fact, I found a virus had tried to copy to Scan.EXE and
the message came back and warned that scan.exe was damaged!  This was at a 
local University computing lab of PC's.  This may be a question that John needs
to answer or even Patti, the Moderator of the Echo.  I will ask her.

I was having a similar problem on my 386 when I got it and as I was running 
DesqView, etc assumed that was causing the probs (it was, in a way) ... I since
discovered that it was simply that buffers was too low. Unfortunately you do 
not have a Hard Drive to see if that would be affected but your 'symptoms' are 
of a low buffers. so, simply change the config.sys and adjust the buffers value
up about 15 this SHOULD fix it. If however, it doesn't, try getting hold of 
SCANv66b and try that

Jeff, sorry to hear about that.  I have been working on a program with several 
Department directors at Lamar concerning this "VIRUS" issue.  The most common 
virus I have ran into is the notorious Jeruselum B Virus.  You can use 
cleanp66.ZIP found on my BBS here to clean the virus.  The other common viruses
are Stoned and Stoned II.  Someone (Perhaps a student) deleted the Chkdsk dos 
command on one system in the Business College Lab and replaced it with a nasy 
trojan.  Tell your friend to try ScanV66B.zip to scan the Drive first whenever 
he boots up.  If viruses are found he can run clean in most cases to clean the 
virus up.

The best cleanup for a virus however, is the Delete command to delete the 
infected files.  If the partitiion table was affected, then it could be the 
Stoned II virus that got him.  How about having this gentleman to call me voice
and see what I can do to help him.

Well virus theory was being discused as far back as the 1940's.  John von 
Neumann outlined an Idea of programms self-replicating themselves in "Theory 
and Organization of Complicated Automata".  And if you want to really be 
boggled read his "The Computerand the Brain" ..
 
I use the '83 date because after Mr Thompson's speech, the following year 
Scientific american published an article further discussing viruses togather 
with an offer were by sending in $2.00 they sent you information on how to 
write virus programs.  I'm sure they rue the day they did that now.
 
At that point viruses where "Fun".  Harmless pranks one programmer could have 
with others.  And also one that could be shared.

I can answer that.  Jerusalem-B will infect an EXE file every time it runs.  It
only infects a COM file once but infect an EXE multiple times.  Clean has to be
run as many times as the file is infected to completely clean it out.

Sounds like someone is puting their data disk in the same drive before the 
buffers are flushed.  If you switch the disks while still in turbo.exe then 
when you exit the program DOS will overwrite the FAT and Directories with what 
it thinks should be there from the previous disk.

Quite regular, the "DELETE" Disinfection IS the only way to go.  After running 
cleanup some times, the user of the software complains that some programs do 
not work.  I just recommend they delete not just the once infected file, but 
rather the software package and re-install it.  I rememeber you mentioning that
piracy abounds in Thailand.  When I was working in the Middle East a few years 
back, i learned you could get a copy of most any software at the Computer 
stores.  They had diskette copying devices.  For 1 Riyal you were in business. 
This is another way viruses were spread.  Everybody would come in and share 
diskettes.

Are you using ScanV66 or ScanV66B?  V66 itself has an bug in it with the

Stoned doesn't alter the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS.  It infects floppy disk 
boot sectors and the hard disk partition table.  When it infects, it usually 
moves the original boot sector on floppies to another sector which is usually 
in the root directory, which results in files being lost if the root directory 
had entries in that area.  What is suggested, though, is that before 
disinfecting Stoned, the user backup his/her data files since in approximately 
1 out of 10 cases, the disinfection will result in the partition table being 
lost on hard disks....this occurs with some hard disk controllers.

Stoned doesn't cause bad sectors to be created.  Two possibilities 
here...either the user disinfected after booting from a version of DOS that was
not the same as what he was originally using, or the disk already had the bad 
sectors to begin with.

    I think the deal is that nobody is really sure what it does, how it

They are pretty accurate, but remember this:  I have been BBS-ing (downloading 
alot) for over 7 years now.  I have called BBSs across the US and I have never,
first hand, seen a virus.  That right there says something about how much hype 
the virus scares are.

Also, remember something about the virus scan programs:  They only find *known*
viruses.  If someone writes a new virus, you are vulnerable.  You might want to
check out something like Flu Shot+ if you want peace of mind.

Hi Patti 
 
        He stated that he recieved a screen mesage informing him that his 
System was Stoned.  I might be mistaken, but I'm sure that that is the Stoner-B
virus Signiture.
 
And while I agree that the Stoner Virus is known To attack the Boot Sector and 
Partition Table.  This is what we saw in our Variant down here.  After 
disinfecting the system, a backup was made.  The HarDrive was then Reformated, 
but still would not Boot up correctly.  It wasn't untill the Autoexec and 
Config files were deleted that it would.
 
Oops ... I stand Corrected on Bad Sectors, I meant to run a utility to check

Thanks for your info though, I just wish whoever keeps creating Variants would 
turn their obvious Talents to somthing more useful.

        At this stage an suspected COM or EXE file is being treated as
        DATA, as far as the the virus scanner is concerned. It is just
        reading the file looking for known virus code.

        For a virus to trigger and infect a system, an infected program
        must be RUN. Until the CPU is fed virus code as instructions to
        run, there is no danger. When scanning for virus code, (within
        SHEZ or not) the program with control of the CPU is SCAN.EXE.
 
        It does not test-run suspected programs to check them for virii,
        it simply reads them.

Hmmm.... I thought I could say that a few months ago. I was called into work 
early one day because one of the p/c's was acting strange. A scan of the drive 
said it had a Jerusalem B virus, 2 days later a friend called and asked what 
was the best way of removing the Jerusalem B virus. This was a different system
completly some 40 miles away. Then to top it off 2 sysops in the area called 
and left messages on my system that they would be down till they removed, you 
got it, the Jerusalem B again. This all took place in less than 5 days. In 
those 5 days it poped up in.
San Francisco
Fairfield
Oakland
San Leandro

I left as quick as it hit, I'm sure there were other unknown systems in the 
area that had it also, it just seems strange that the small circle I'm involved
with, 4 totaly unrelated systems were hit.

The source of the virus is still a mystery, the only thing that was in common 
was each system had a file on it called MIRROR.   I forgot what the extension 
was.
Well thats my 2 cents

Locally we experienced a trojan that was an exe file compiled by a utility that
converts .bat to .exe files.  The file purported to be a means to provide mnp5 
performance from an ordinary modem.  In fact the compiled bat instructions 
destroyed the C: drive.
 
What bothers me about this is the simplicity with which anybody could do this. 
I have the Bat2exec.zip file which performs the conversions.  I have not used 
it because the majority of my bat files are short fast executing things anyway.
 
Has anybody else encountered the problem and is there any sort of generic 
defense that we might arrange against the generic attack files which may 
follow?

Ken I live in Hayward.  I believe my system was infected by a Disk Manager 
diskette provided to me by a dealer who admitted that some of his system were 
infected by the jeru B virus.
 
Naturally he wanted to tell me that I had picked up my infection from a BBS. 
Strange to relate, none of the local boards to which I restrict my calling had 
this infection.
 
This dealer was in Sunnyvale.   If that raises any suspicions from the list of 
boards that you are referring to, why don't you call me voice some evening 
before 7:00 (lock up the phone with BBS'ing after that usually) and I'll tell 
you the dealer name.
 
They claim to have dealt with the problem so I don't want to smear them perhaps
inappropriately.  My home number is 415-889-0898.  My work number if you want

Very good advice!  There are a lot of files that won't disinfect correctly, 
such as programs that use internal overlays, or files that have the length set 
in the .EXE header incorrectly to begin with....so running a disinfector can 
result in the infected file not working correctly after disinfection.  The only
saving grace is that the program probably didn't run correctly before 
disinfection either since in the case of files with internal overlays, the 
virus would have overlayed part of the program.  Also, disinfectors typically 
can only disinfect the more common viruses since they account for 90%+ of all 
infections, or new viruses which are thought will be a future problem due to 
their characteristics.  If you are unlucky enough to get a rare virus, then you
would have to replace all the programs.

The only advice I would add is if someone is infected with any of the viruses 
which infect the partition table, they should backup critical data files they 
can't afford to loose before attempting to disinfect the system.  There are 
some combinations of DOS/BIOS/Hardware which, when disinfected, can result in 
the hard drive becoming inaccessible (happens in about 10% of the Stoned/Stoned
II cases).

The next release of the McAfee Associates programs scheduled for September 25 
have been rescheduled to October 2 or 3, according to the call I received 
yesterday from McAfee himself.  The delay is to allow them to complete some 
addition of new features to the programs.  If you call Homebase to pickup these
programs, hold off until the 3rd so that you don't have an unneeded 
long-distance call.... 

Due to illness and having one of my two test machines having intermittent 
hardware problems, I'm going to be also delaying the release of the new version
of the Virus Information Summary List until October 2 or 3 as well.  The 
additional week in there is to make sure the Whale virus makes it into the new 
version of the listing, as well as insuring that almost (if not) all of the new
viruses and variants I've received are included.  The October 2 or 3 release 
will be VSUM9009.Zip, there will still be an October release which is scheduled
for late October though they will be just two or three weeks apart.  The 
October release will also include another new "section" to the list that 
several people have indicated they thought would be useful.... <grin>....more 
about that right before the release date.

Hopefully, this message will allow some of the non-Silicon Valley users of the 
McAfee programs and my listing to avoid long-distance charges if picking up new
releases is their primary reason to place the calls....

I just got my system trashed twice..by the same bug if it is one..or if it's 
hadware...

What it does is it causes the drive(hard drive mind you) light to flash on and 
off intermittenntly with intervals of 1 second...the hard drive becomes 
unusable till midnight the next day...

Has there been other reports of such a virus?

I used to say that, too.  In fact, I used almost the same, exact words. 
However, recently almost all of the PC's at the college where I teach
information systems got the Stoner virus.  Since I have students turn in
disks as homework, had I not taken the appropriate precautions, my machine
would have becomed "stoned" as well.  Currently, several of my users who work
for Ford have "caught" the Joshi (sp?) virus and have been on my board
looking for the "cure".  I no longer have a cavalier attitude when it comes
to viruses.

   Let me give you a quick rundown.  The file is about a year and a half old, 
and claims to use some proprietary CRC mechanism.  I'll zip it up as 
"MCRC.ZIP", and you may request it by the time this message reaches you.  I

NO!!  Your system won't get infected unless you RUN of those
infected .COM or .EXE files.  A virus can only do its thing
if it is executed.  Reading it isn't enough.

Here is a simple detection program that will detect the 4096 while it is
in memory. It will not become infected by the 4096 (the 4096 thinks the
file is already infected). I wrote it for the shareware A86, but it should
assemble with MASM, TASM or WASM with few modifications.

This program should also detect the Fish-6 and Mother Fish

Hi!
I'm new here and had a question.
Is it possible for a virus to enter the computer system and remain their when 
the system is shut down for the night, and resurface when the IBM/clone system 
is turned on in the morning?
Background:  We have had viruses at at local college in the computer labs, in 
the Macintosh and clone computers.  We turn the computer off for ten seconds to
dump any virus in the memory.  Then we turn the computer back on.  One of the 
lab techs said it might be possible for a virus to stay in the system even if 
turned on and then off.

Subj: ARTICLE IN BEAUMONT ENTERPRISE
Quoting an Article which appeared in the Beaumont Enterprise on Saturday, 
October 6, 1990 from the Associated Press:
______________________________
ASSOCIATED PRESS
______________________________
NEW VIRUSES INFECT COMPUTERS

DALLAS - Computer Viruses, once percieved as contagious only through shared 
programming or electronic"bulletin boards," have wormed thier way into brand 
new equipment purchased from reputable companies.
  In one incident earlier this year, workers at an Evaleth, Minn., company were
suprised when thier computers suddenly began flashing the message: "Your 
system has been stoned."  The virus, which didn't destroy any data, was traced 
back to software in brand new modems, the devices that hook computers to 
telephone lines.
  Computer Viruses have been around for several years and there seem to have 
been several widely publicized infections.  But only recently have viruses 
begun to be reported in new equipment, and computer manufacturers are reluctant
to discuss the situation, fearing even a hint of contamination could torpedo 
sales.
  "A year ago we had nothing like this.  Now, it's almost an everyday 
occurrence," said John McAfee, Chairman of the Computer Virus Industry 
Association in Santa Clara, Calif.
  "Yes it has happened," said Winn Schwartau, president of American Security 
Industries, Inc., a Nashville, Tenn. consulting firm.  "And the posiblity of it
occurring on a larger scale is all too great and unfortunately it is 
unrecognized."
  In the modem case, the virus was quickly discovered and narrowly contained, 
said John Pope, spokesman for CompuAdd, Corp., an Austin-based computer 
retailer and mail-order house that sold the infected modems.

-=- END -=-

I don't agree that the wording that viruses were spread through "electronic 
Bulletin Boards" in the second line.  My understanding is that a virus is a 
replicating code within a computer program or set of instructions, and that 
would mean running the code or program.

However, it is highly possible that the ROM of the modem could have contained 
the Viral Code to send that message to the screen.  It is not my belief, 
however that the modem ROM could actually write to the drives, just issue 
interrupt requests, which are then interpreted by the command$ spec within the 
computer system.  Again, not a virus, but a simple (or complex Trojan).  And 
since most modems operate at interrupt 14, that would be logical for me not to 
be frightened of such things happening.  I really think that the press should 
be more responsible in thier articles.

Paul, I have the Clean Diskette by Mcafee.  Also, several other good programs 
from his Board such as Vshield, Scan, Vcopy, Checkout11 and severl other 
programs I downloaded from his BBS.  If you like, just reply to me and I will 
stick them all on a 1.2MB Floppy DIskette and Mail them TO Randy Goebal at his 
Address.  He can then get them to you, or better yet, just netmail me at 19/49 
and tell me where to send the diskettes.  I don't know about the JOSHI, becuase
I have never been confronted with it, but the Stoned and Stoned II Virus is bad
at the University where I work.  So, ScanV66B.ZIP works to identify and 
CleanP66.ZIP will remove both of them, or Use M-Disk.ZIP, which again is on my 
Board for Download.  The Stoned Virus appears to infect the FAT Tables of the 
Hard Drives there and eventually, the drives have to be low-leveled and 
re-formatted.

Thanks for the offer, but I don't need the cures.  I was merely telling someone

CleanUp  V67 - CLEANP67.ZIP
NetScan  V67 - NETSCN67.ZIP
VShield  V67 - VSHLD67.ZIP

The VCopy program was not released as a V67, so the current version remains
V66B, and is downloadable as VCOPY66B.ZIP.

New viruses now detectable by Scan are: Casper, 1605, Violator, Blood2,
Wisconsin, Christmas In Japan, Burger, Leprosy-B, Whale, Invader, Scott's
Valley, Black Monday, and Nomenklatura/Nomenclature.  Also added with this
release is an extinct switch: Scan will no longer automatically check for
viruses which either are research viruses or have not been reported in the
public domain for over 1 year.  Please see the documentation for details.

CleanUp has added disinfectors for Whale, Invader, Slow, and EDV.

VShield now has a new feature to check the validate codes which Scan can
add to files.  Again, please check the documentation.

these viruses infect every single disk that comes in contact with the machine, 
and contaminated data disks re-infect the system.

Definately. In fact, very few virii stay in memory only. Nearly ALL virii write
themselves to disk(usally to COM or EXE files and some in OVL files as well). 
After a cold reboot, the virus is USUALLY cleared from memory(I've never heard 
of it still being there, but.....).   The can get into memory though during 
Bootup through various ways though so your best bet if you THINK you have a 
virus is to do a cold reboot from your ORIGINAL DOS disk and then use a virus 
checker(Scan is one of the best) on your hard drive and ALL of your floppies. 
Also make sure you put a w/p tab on your virus checking disk as soon as you get
it so it doesn't get infected. I find that making a bootable disk and putting 
SCAN on it in the autoexec file and the put a w/p on it is pretty easy to do.  

 
     Try not to worry TOO MUCH about getting one but do take a reasonable 
amount of checking.

That is a good idea, Charles. I have a program similar to that at the 
University I work at in Texas.  The students/or other users must go through a 
"corridor" to get into the lab.  They must turn over all disks to be scanned by
the Lab Clerk.  If a virus is found, the student is informedand the disk is 
usually cleaned first.  If that works, we still recommend that they format the 
disk over to be sure.  Then, when they stick their disk in the computers in the
lab, we also perform another test which I wrote - but it is not a TSR program. 
The hard drive is securely protected and will not allow access to DOS or an 
application program until the disk passes.  That way, we cut down on the 
chances of infection.

THe main problem I have found is Computer Technicians that do NOT know about 
viruses or just flatly refuse to recognize the problems and do not scan their 
diagnostic disks.  They are the worst carriers.  They pick up a virus, then go 
diagnose someone elses system and spread it.  A local area Retailer is one who 
refuses to recognize the problem and has spread many Jerulselum B headaches....

But you have a good idea!  Wanna work on it?  How about Turbo C or just Quick 
Basic would work...  Would be glad to help you out as long as it will remain 
"Militantly Public Domain".

I once spoke with a person who ran a BBS and said he had a 'fool-proof' 
protection from anything (I don't know if he's trustworthy, but here's his 
idea): He put a physical switch on the cables to his hard drives. He would copy
a suspected file into a RamDrive and then shut off his drives. He'd run the 
program in RAM and see what happened. That way, no writes were possible.
 
How possible is it that this would work? It seems like you'd have to 
reconfigure your whole system after shutting off the drives, which would 
include a power-down, which would wipe out RAM???

Satyr,
  I believe that you are mistaken. Virtually the only way to spread STONED is 
through direct disk access (ie. Copying files, fformatin diskettes....). STONED
is a Boot sector infector and will omly spread in that fashion. It does not 
attach itself to any executables but instead resides in the partition table. I 
agree with your sentiment wholeheartedly, but I do not think that the BBS is to
blame. (Gosh, we BBSs get all the blame!).

Hello, "Ice"....
   My suggestion to you (and anyone else, actually) is to rely on the Author's 
board for a "clean" copy of the program. The latest version of ViruScan 
(SCANVxx) is version 67 B (a minor bug fix to version 67)....John McAfee and 
the Home base crew are very attentive to detail. The next release is 
tentatively scheduled for November 25th (I believe). There are some =rules= 
though, when it comes to scanning/disinfecting and the documentation should be 
read in entirety. Hope this helps. I would post the BBS # but I think that 
would be a =little= commercial.

Remember the terrible (or perhaps it was great, I can't remember which) story 
of the Trojan War and the Trojan Horse...Well, that is what a Trojan Horse 
program produces. Something quite undesireable, like formatting all of your 
sectors to dust. A virus, on the other hand, can replicate, attach itself to a 
"host" and for whatever you can image, have any number of "triggers to become 
detructive. My best advise that I can give is to get ahold of a copy of Patti 
Hoffman's "Virus Information Summary List" which is produced monthly. This is 
an invaluable document for reference purposes.

A "Trojan Horse" is a referral to an ancient Greek myth of a large wooden
horse that was given to the city of Troy.  The Troyans brought the horse into
the city, to discover later that enemy soldiers were hiding inside.  The
soldiers proceeded to flatten the city.

A "Trojan Horse" program is similar.  It's a program that damages your
computer in some way.  Usually, a Trojan Horse does its damage once, whereas
a virus may infect other programs and repeatedly destroy things.

Any program could be a Trojan Horse; there's simply no sure-fire way of
detecting them.  A simple way to write one would be:


  char junk[20000] = {'\0'};            // give it a realistic file size

  int
  main(void)
  {
    system( "echo y | format c:" );     // do some damage
    puts( "Nyah, nyah!!" );             // brag about it
  }


Then claim that it's a telecommunications package or something.  These types
of Trojans are usually detected fairly quickly, as anyone who gets a copy
pretty much knows what did it.

It's those hidden little time-bombs that could be lurking ANYWHERE that are
the problem.

Ok. If more people understood how virus's worked then more people
would not get in trouble with them. There are some real good things
about virus's when it come to beening able to program one. I have
writen 2 so far, and of course destroyed them. What they do is teach
you more  about how the config.sys and the command com works. Also
how to deal with tagging into exe files, and harddrives.
The above message is very upsetting to me as a novice programer
computer's main reason is to share infomation, not restrict it. Now
what you are telling me is that you would like to restrict what people
can learn and what they can create. What are we doing going back to some
sort of computer dark ages.   Vinson

Subj: RE: QUESTION
Scott, you'd have to go into more detail on your "scramble"d FAT before
it'd become obvious that a virus had hit it; I'd bet that it's the disk
"optimizer" you mentioned.  You didn't say which one it was, but
several of them, particularly older ones, can be quite nasty if
something unusual happens during the optimization run; they can even be
nasty if something unusual DOESN'T happen!.  Were you running a disk
enhancement utility such as SpeedStor or Disk Manager?  These, or other
TSRs like disk caches, especially ones with delayed writes, can add
still more problems.
 
As for possible fixes, I'd suggest that you try one of the "fixit"
programs in Norton Utilities 5.0, PC Tools Deluxe 6.0, or Mace
Utilities 1990.  The "Emergency Room" utility in the latter gets
particularly high marks; I've found it to fix disks that the others
wouldn't even admit existed!  If these won't help, you can contact one
of the commercial data recovery firms, but they can be
exxpppeeeennnnnssssssiiiiiiivvvvvvvveeeeeeeee..........
 
One final piece of advice:  Before you try to optimize again, 1) BACK
UP!; 2) Copy to save files CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT; 3) Delete them
and reboot to remove any TSRs (note:  If you're running a Disk
Manager-type of disk enhancer, you can't remove it.  In that case, make
sure that the optimizer you're using specifically states that it'll
work with the particular disk enhancer you're using.) and run the
optimizer on a "clean" system.  Hope some of this helps...

direct processor instructions.
 
I guess I was hoping some really clever programmer out there would be able to

Paul, I have been following this echo for a few days and am amazed at the 
hatred spread toward viruses. They are programs, just like Lotus 123 or dBase 
IV. There are good reasons for "friendly" viruses, such as automatic error 
detection and correction for unattended systems. System crash cleaners, I guess
you could call them. I welcome replies, but no screaming. Just intelligent 
conversation. :-)

It is possible and is a commercial product. Arrick/Microsync in Ft.Worth, 
Texas, has a product called "WriteGuard" which does just that. Let's you flip a
switch anytime and make the hard drive write protected. It also intercepts any 
writes to the hard disk and informs you with a buzzer, so you know when 
something tries to write to the drive. Call (817)540-0938. Tell them I sent 
you. (They are friends of mine.My brother used to own it, but sold it and they 
kept the name, so I'm not affiliated with them except by friendship.)

  Well, Vinson, I must take an opposing view concerning programming. Any code 
than can secretly attach itself to any of my clients executables (or whatever, 
you should know what I mean) is quite undesireable, especially if it slows 
processing speed or is destructive in any fashion. That is the equivalent of 
Invasion of Privacy. I commend you for "destroying" whatever it is/was that you

are a myriad of viruses popping up every month that keep every extremely busy

Satyr, the Stoned virus is a boot sector and partition table virus, it does not
infect executable program files such as .COM and .EXE files.  You cannot get it
from a download from a BBS unless the download happens to be a complete, 
compressed file containing an image of a floppy disk.  If you got a virus from 
a normal file that you downloaded, it wasn't the Stoned virus.  It may have 
been a file infector that also carries a boot sector infector, such as the 
Invader virus which was only isolated within the last month.  How did you

there is one, sort of. it's called CHK4BOMB. it comes with the FLUSHOT
package. what it does is look for calls to direct disk writes and warns you
that the program you're examining uses them. mostly it just looks for calls
to INT 13 instructions. not perfect, but worth checking out.

No, they are not synonyms but they are similar.

The term "trojan" comes from the story of Helen of Troy and the Trojan Horse.  
To refresh your memory:  Troy was a very well fortified city. So the enemy's of
Troy built a horse, hid inside it and parked it in front of the gates of Troy. 
The Trojans thought it was a gift from the gods and brought it in.  Once 
inside, the guys inside the horse jumped out and battled inside of Troy (I 
don't remember who won, though). 

But in any case, a Trojan is a program that says it will do something useful 
but does something damaging instead.  It differs from a virus in that it 
doesn't infect any other program.  But like a virus, it may choose to damage 
your disk now or some time in the future.

Hello, again, Darin....
 I apologize if it seemed liked "screaming"...actually quite the opposite. You 
are obviously looking at this situation from an esoteric standpoint. I see the 
damage a virus can do (gone unchecked and allowed to run it's course) on a 
regular basis. Some of my unsuspecting users go for months sometimes thinking 
that their recurring problems (whatever they may be, in this instance) are 
actually hardware problems. Technicians that must break routine and travel to 
correct such viral surfacings are bogged down enough. We handle all the 
hardware and software support for a very large government agency here in DC, 
all their sites locally =and= around the world. It gets to be a =very= large 
problem at times. I cannot at times allow myself to become esoteric. Perhaps 
you see my point.
 
Greetings (again) from Washington, DC

Well, it didn't wrap correctly, but what the hey....
There is a newer, enhanced offshoot of CHK4BMB called TRAPDISK. Based on the 
aforementioned, it seems to work rather well...I have tested it in a couple of 
instances in "triggered" type viruses without mishap (although I would =never= 
rely on it =completely).
It is a decent program and worth a look.

It doesn't have to really screw anything up; you *could* just change the
media descriptor and the corresponding info in the boot sector.  Then it
would be fairly straightforward to resurrect a disk.  It would also be less

I am having a strange problem with a Telex 286 AT computer's floppy. 
I have tried replacing the floppy drive, the controller, the cable, 
etc.  We have other Telex machines that work fine.  But now I am 
suspicious... 
 
Does anyone out there know of a virus that causes excessive read 
errors on the floppy disks?  This is the only machine in our shop 
that does this, but it also is isolated from anything else.  One of 
our technicians copied some software from it to his own floppy to use on his 
machine at home, and the same problem started to appear on the home machine! 
There is no 'Kilroy' message or anything...just the 
random failure on the disk.  The floppies it's reading work fine on 
the other machines in our shop, so this is beginning to make me 
curious.  The message we keep getting is the A)bort, R)etry, I)gnore msg.

 I agree that computer information should be free. The traditional view of a 
virus is something that sneaks into your computer and destroys your hard drive 
data. Yes, there are a lot that do that. A virus could also monitor system 
functions and watch for unusual activity (like a "bad" virus) and stop it 
before anything destructive can occur. They are both "viruses", one good, one 
bad.
Don't a lot of virus detection programs do what the above example does? Yup. 
Just remember, you're using a virus to protect yourself from a virus 
(fighting-fire-with-fire theory). If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
 
Just my opinion.

Scott, it is possible that the optimizer or some other utility that was run on 
the system caused the crosslinking of the files, but it is also possible it was
a virus.  Most of the "stealth" type viruses can have this symptom, 
particularly if CHKDSK is run with the /F parameter.  The effect occurs because
the "stealth" type viruses adjust the directory on the fly, but not the file 
allocation table.  Which version of Scan did you use?  

If you take a look at the Virus Information Summary List, towards the back 
there is a revision history.  To look at only the more recent viruses, look up 
the viruses that were added with the last couple of releases. 

 SH> PS.  I would like to take this list to the other folks at the AIS 
 SH> meeting here at NASA Headquarters and the meeting is on Oct. 17 so if 
 SH> anyone can get back to me before then I would appreciate it.

Keep in mind that the Virus Information Summary List must be site licensed with
the author (me) if it is used in one of several types of environments.  NASA is
considered both "government" and "agency", and not "non-profit", as far as I'm 
concerned.  Please do not take it into NASA for purposes of distributing it if 
they aren't going to check into licensing it.  If it is distributed there, as 
with any other government location or agency, it must be site licensed.  (Sorry
if the words are a little harsh, but after a recent "problem", it had to be 
stated.)

Yup,  I got one once that was a TSR made to look like a trojan.  What it did 
was you loaded it, told it how long to wait and then how many presses of the 
enter key to watch for, and then would pop up a full screen display of 
"Contratulations you have won a complete hard disk format"  along with a 
display showing as if it were really doing it.  It also scanned the disk as it 
did it to look more realistic.  I pulled it on a friend and he really hit panic

think it was funny for about 2 days.  Then he couldn't stop laughing for a 
week.  <grin>

Subj: REPLY TO MSG# 25279 (DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO MAKE VIRUS)
 By the way, I've had my share of viruses (from a bad point). Wheen I first got
my Amiga about a year ago, 30 out of 40 disks which came with it were infected 
with the "Lamer Exterminator" virus. Fortunately, a gentleman named Steve 
Tibbetts has seen it fit to fight bad viruses on the Amiga with his heart and 
soul. He wrote and EXCELLENT virus detection and vaccinations program called 
VirusX. It checks each disk automatically as soon as it is inserted into the 
disk drive. (The Amiga checks it's drives automatically for disk changes, and 
therefore, he just latched onto this routine.) I just switched disks until it 
had killed them all. Took me about 10-15 minutes for 30 disks or so.
 The most recent happened about 6 months ago (Amiga again). There is a virus 
that seems to be able to disrupt your real time clock and it caused mine not to
work. I think it actually stores itself in battery backed clock RAM. Solution :
(you're gonna love this) I shorted the battery terminals together with a 
screwdriver. It scrambled the memory, and therefore, the virus, too. I reset my
clock and haven't seen it since.
 I wish I could have taken the code for these viruses and disassembled it. It 
seems like there is quite a bit of programming time and talent which goes into 
one. (I know, most people think there's no talent in destructive viruses, but, 
you have to admit, the programmers know their stuff.)
 I like to classify programs, viruses, and programmers and hackers into two 
groups : black and white. Black = evil, destructive
White = Good, constructive. There are black viruses and white viruses. Black 
hackers and white hackers. (I hope no one takes this as racial, because I don't
mean it that way. I'm talking about personality, not skin color.)
 
I consider myself a white hacker.

The current version is 67B.

 Hello, Ryan...
 The current versions of SCAN and CLEAN are versions 67c and 67,  respectively.
(SCANV67C.ZIP and CLEANP67.ZIP)...
 I'm sure that you will receive quite a few replies like this, but I
 thought I may as well respond nonetheless.
 
 Greetings from Washington, DC

Scott, 
  The bugs that were previously encountered with the addition of validation 
codes (/AV) have been worked out with the subsequent releases. No other 
problems have been reported since the bug fixes were released. 
  As far as how to acquire a copy, please feel free to log onto my BBS anytime.
I'm located in DC (just a stones throw away) and I have a nice selection of 
AntiViral utilities including SCAN and CLEAN. I download the new release 
directly from McAfee Associates BBS when they are put into circulation. I'll 
NetMail you the number. Anyone else desiring the number can make a request via 
NetMail, as well.
I feel that this forum is a bit =too= public and it would not be entirely 
proper to "advertise" here.
 
Look forward to hearing from you,

Subj: FILE VIRUS
Can anyone help me with what I think is a new virus?
The symtoms are when the infected disk is loaded the machine instntly
gurus and then continues to guru for every disk inserted untill you
power down.
The disks contain a invisable file that resides in no directorys but in
the general loose file area of disk.
The file when viewed with Diskmaster V3.0 appears as " AAAA....."
or similar to this.Also in the startup-sequence is a similar file to this
 "     ...    AA .."
Now this is the first file in the startup-sequence and it also is hidden
from normal view.
So far no virus detector programs have detected it.
Can anyone identify this virus?
The solution I used was to delete both files then repair bootblock with
Novirus. However disk is still not 100%.
                                   warren.

 Do you think that if an antiviral virus was released which destroyed malignant
viruses, it would be condoned or scorned? Even people who didn't know they were
protected would be protected. I don't think anyone would mind. I know I 
wouldn't mind the extra peace of mind that it would bring. 
 Yes, and I now realize that those are TSRs, but I was talking about the Amiga 
world, not the PC. On the PC they are TSRs. On the Amiga, which natively 
multitasks, they are tasks, programs which are running continuously. This is my
understanding of them.

Scott, if you're using the PC-Cache from PC Tools 6.0, there's been
several updates released since the original package started shipping. 
I'd suggest that you dial into their BBS and pick up the latest; it
might prevent your disks from being scrambled again.  It might also be
necessary to disable delayed writes; depending upon the circumstances,
those beasties can be very deadly.  Anyway, I'm glad to see that it
wasn't some new virus; there's enough of those beasties floating around
already!  Tom Smith/Dallas...

Well, you really can't be 100% sure.  What you have to do is assume and be very
careful.

1) Boot (cold boot) from your ORIGINAL DOS floppy (you know, the one that came 
with your DOS manual in that little binder from Microsoft or IBM).  Create your
bootable floppy from the original DOS disk and then don't use the original DOS 
disk again.

2) Download SCANV only from a respectable BBS who's Sysop checks programs out. 
Also, run the verify program that comes with SCANV to verify that things are 
good.

3) The same goes for your de-archiver: download from only respectable BBSs.

4) As for your comm program, since you have a good de-archiver, SCANV and DOS 
bootable floppy, you should be able to scan term program downloaded from, 
again, a respectable BBS.


The best way is to just be careful.  Most Viruses are "evolutionary dead ends".
If someone out there finds a program going around infected, he will let 
everyone know.

Well ... When scanned by Virucide, the Virus Identified was "Stoner" virus, as 
to how the infection occured.  That is where we become a bit lost. Although as 
you have stated it was in all probability brought in by one of the workers ... 
and not downloaded in this case.  But my point was that everything should 
always be checked irregardless of how the information is brought to a system. 
I never intended for it to mean I was somehow blaming the BBS's for our current

An antivirus virus might mistake a legitimate program for a
virus.  Take a disk compacting (sorting) program, for example.
It does a lot of low-level stuff with sector reads and the FAT,
the same sort of thing a virus might do.

Here we go again.....My sentiments ride with you, Ken. But haven't we pretty 
much beaten this topic to death? I suppose that we will have to continue to

Talk to you later, Ken....

Charles,

Uhh...<laughing>....Uncle Sam and his hired help always lag behind the 
information dispersed within this echo...For example...
 
4096 is "old" news....Your reliable sources are behind in the times, so to 
speak....

1701 is the IBM error message (equivalent) of either a Hard sisk failure or 
Hard Disk Controller failure...Check out your hardware first.
