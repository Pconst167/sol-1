  General Comments:

   The scitzo virus was written in Lund, Sweden 1994, by someone calling
   himself Red A. A person with a great sense of humour and programming
   capabilities.

   The first release of this virus was send out to atleast one major
   bulletin-board-system located somewhere in Sweden. From this place
   it was downloaded by a great number of loosers, that got their files
   corrupted due to a slight bug in the infection-routine. This bug was
   however fixed in the latter version.

   Scitzo will install itself resident in the top of memory but below the
   640 kb boundary, allocating enough space for itself. It's not shown
   whenever a mem /c is performed, still mem and chkdsk will report the
   loss of memory.

   Whenever a file is executed, or opened (for any reason) the virus will
   infect that file. The next time this program is executed, it will check
   if it's already is resident, if so, it'll not go-up again, otherwise,
   it'll load itself into the memory waiting to infect new targets. Either
   way, it'll then let the original program execute normally. Making this
   virus non-overwriting (duh).

   Before the virus is about to close the (now) infected file, there is
   a one percent that the virus will add 'I feel a little scitzo...' to
   the end of the file. Otherwise, the Scitzo virus doesn't do anything
   besides replicating.
