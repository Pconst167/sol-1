Type : Resident Mutating Spawning EXE Infector 
Activation : 14th of an month - displays a message - no damage
Symptoms : Message on 14th - The first infected file ran will
           not execute it's corresponding EXE file. I'm working
           on fixing that. From that point on, everything
           executes normally.

General Notes :
        This virus infects all eligible files in a directory, as
        soon as you change directories, or change drives. It, 
        ofcourse, creates corresping read-only and hidden 
        COM files to EXE files it infects. So, the original 
        EXE files will not be changed, so all those CRC 
        utils out there won't detect any change in the files.. 
        This virus, is a mutating virus, however this version 
        is only a simple one at that. Approximatly 20 bytes remain
        decrypted.
