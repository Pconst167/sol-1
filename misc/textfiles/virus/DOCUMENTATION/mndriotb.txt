         YAM - Youngsters Against McAffee

Programmer:        [LiCl]
Language Used:     ASM [TASM v1.0]

Notes:   This is the highly awaited Strain B version of The Mind Riot.  This
         version is 100% more dangerous than the first version.  I used a INT
         13, AH 05 command instead of the normal INT 26.  This Virus goes off
         on May 16th, 1992 (a Saturday...when everyone is using their computer)
         If it isn't 5/16/1992 then the virus will go off within 33 mins. of
         running it.  This Virus prints a message to the screen each time that
         it infects (or is used).  I added more encryption to this virus at the
         last minute just for Otto Schtuck (YAM 92), and added the extra 33 min
         timer for Mr. Mike (YAM 92).  The extra timer should wipe out all XTs
         that don't have an internal clock, and will also wipe out some of the
         lamers that get this virus after the destructing date.
