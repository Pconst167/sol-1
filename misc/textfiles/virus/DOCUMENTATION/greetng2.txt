Notes On Virus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  One of my latest quality releases.  I actually spent time on this one to
perk it up a bit.  It's been my best so far.  Hope you like it.

  It is a TSR com and exe infector.  It infects these files when they are
run.  On infection it preserves the files date, time, and attributes to help
with stealth a bit.  It is also encrypted.  Tried to keep this encryption
routine as small as possible.

  When first run the virus will hook interrupts 8 (timer), 9 (keyboard), and
21 (DOS).  Then it will move itself into memory.

  Thanks go to Dark Angel of P/S where I learned how to go resident in
memory.  (At least I'm honest)  Without him I would still be at the
non-resident stage right now.  Even though those are fun to do every now and
then.

  The virus will probably use up 2236 bytes of memory.  But I never actually
checked.  Any infected file will have a file increase of about 1118 bytes.

  During the hours of 9am and 3pm (During school hours) a bouncing ball will
appear on the screen.  Well actually an asterisk.  In text mode it will just
erase its path on the screen and look normal.  But when it graphics mode it
will appear as big black blocks.  Well on VGA that is.  Also during this time
when a reboot is called a message will appear on the screen and wait five
seconds before the actual reboot.  I'm not too sure how this works on
different computers.  Sometimes it will hang the computer after the message.

  Look out for version two of Greetings.  Its just about done.  It will
include most of the above but it will show the ball effect at a different
time so infection is not so noticeable.  Maybe when in graphics mode the ball
will not be show.  (Hey let the "Warez Puppies" have their final fun)  Dir
stealth will be included as recently I have learned how to do it also from
Dark Angel of P/S.  I learned most of my stuff from him.  More stuff is added
but that I can't bother to go into.

Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~
  The source code will be released as this virus gets around more.  I worked
hard on it and I'm not going to give up the source until it's scannable.
