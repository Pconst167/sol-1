                     IE-VCC v0.09á    PRIVATE RELEASE!!!
                              Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
   This is the TEST-DRIVE version of IE-VCC (I-EAS Virus Creation Centre),
    this version is only for members of I-EAS and Omega, the sysop of our
    WHQ (World HeadQuarters). This test-drive version contains allmost
    every function, EXCEPT activation routines, i'm too lazy to build them
    so you will have to wait for the next version (0.19á). That won't take
    too long, but first i wan't to finish IVM-95-1 our very own virus mag!

What you need to use IE-VCC:

 - MS-DOS / IBM-DOS v3.2 or up
 - A video-card that can handle 80 collumns mode
 - Turbo Assembler / Turbo linker (Please use multi-pass /M2)
 - Enough free memory (I think 100k will do the job)
 - Very little experience with assembler (you will have to create your own
    trigger & activation routines)
 - A text editor (For example: Q.EXE)
 - A 8088 / 8086 or up (Sorry CP/M owners!)

What you absolutely don't need:

 - WINDOWS!!!! (Yech, it ain't even a virus, a virus DOES something!!!)
 - A mouse

                            The Configuration file
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration file can contain remarks, use the ';' sign.
Every command is seperated by a CR+LF (just use the Enter/Return key).
Every data passed to a command should be quoted (eg. Author ID = '[HH]')
In the function name may be as much spaces if you want, or none (eg.
   A U T H OR I  D    =  '[HH]'), The data must be fixed.

The commands you can use are:

Virus Name     (Eg. Virus Name='Manual.Doc Virus')
Virus ID       (Eg. Virus ID='[MD]')
Author Name    (Eg. Author Name='Hacking Hell')
Author ID      (Eg. Author ID='[HH]')

Infections     This function sets the Infections per run
               (Eg. Infections='999')

Anti-TBAV      This function hides the virus, no heuristic flags will
                appear (Eg. Anti-TBAV='YES')

Anti-MSAV      This function will make the virus take VSAFE down from
                memory (Eg. Anti-MSAV='YES')

Encryption     This function will make the virus encrypted or not
                (Eg. Encryption='YES')

Anti-Trace     This function will make the virus untraceble, a variable
                is passed to this function: 
                '0' : No Anti-Trace code.
                '1' : Minor Anti-Trace code.
                '2' : Major Anti-Trace code (* Not built in yet *).
                (Eg. Anti-Trace='1')

Traversal      This function sets if the virus should go to the '..'
                directory to find more files, if there were not enough
                infections. (Eg. Traversal='YES')

Target File    This function sets the name of the assembly file.
                (Eg. Target File='MANUAL.ASM')

That's all folks! (Easy isn't it!)

For examples, look in the 'SAMPLES' directory, every function will be
 shown (AND USED!!).
