         3. INFO

         You don't have to read this whole document before trying to
         do something with the toolkit!

         If you have never written a virus in Assembler, you can start
         with the toolkit!  (well, almost!)

         Khntark's Recursive Tunneling Toolkit is an object module
         that can be linked to any virus.

         The virus should be assembled and linked with KRTT41.OBJ
         using Turbo Assembler 2.0 and above.

         Using other Assemblers might cause unexpected results.

         The toolkit, when called will try find the address of DOS's
         real int 21h / 2Ah / 13h.

         The output code returned will depend on the results found by
         the toolkit.

         KRTT41.OBJ is truly a NO-FRILLS object module. You need
         nothing to use it. It is a simple, 'plug and play' item; just
         save the registers, call it and act depending upon the
         output.

         Unlike other tunneling routines KRTT DOES NOT use Interrupt 1
         to trace through the current interrupts, as this technique
         can be easily disabled by any decent resident AV utility.

         อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ
         4. What the hell is tunneling?
            Why use this?

         A quick explanation: Antivirus system monitoring software are
         Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs that remain in
         memory and hook or capture INT 21h / 2Ah / 13h and other
         vital system interrupts.
         
         These programs monitor all calls made to these interrupts for
         'suspicious' or 'virus-like' behaviour. An example would be
         unauthorized writing to a file thought INT 21h, function 40h.

         These programs ensure that all viruses not using any
         tunneling or stealth routines are detected when trying to
         infect or remain resident in memory.

         Some examples of such programs will even monitor their own
         code to ensure they are not removed from memory or their
         INT 21h handler is not replaced by other programs.


         KRTT41 will get the DOS's original INT 21h / 2Ah / 13h, in
         most cases, and can turn your virus into a 'smart' one by
         warning about the possibility of strange AV software present
         in memory.

         Once DOS's original interrupts are found you can call them
         directly to memory freely, bypassing any AV software present
         in memory and infecting other files right through their
         protection!

         The ability to locate DOS's original INT 13h is provided
         by KRTT to implement potentially destructive code.
         (None of the examples contain such code.)

         You could also use the original int 21h to allocate/free
         memory and disable any software present in memory.

         Such scenarios are possible but they have not tested fully,
         so no claims can be made.

         KRTT41's strength lies in a recursive nature which allows
         tracing and scanning through multiple hooked INT 21h's.

         You can load multiple non-conflicting system monitoring
         antivirus programs and KRTT41 will go through them!

         Be it 1 or 6 - admittedly a ridiculous situation - it won't
         make a difference.

         KTTR41 is very small due to its recursive nature. And
         it is fast since it uses no memory locations for data
         storage; all the operations are done directly in the CPU
         registers.

         KTTR41 is fully compatible with Trident's Polymorphic Engine
         Version 1.4 and future polymorphic Engines.

         Such compatibility is assured as long as KRTT 4.1 is linked
         before any Polymophic Engine.

         Note: See YB-1.ASM for TpE 1.4 linkage demonstration.

         5. USAGE:

         You need the following at the beginning of your program:

         extrn TUNNEL:near
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
         then call anytime during program execution (preferably at the
         start):

         call TUNNEL
         ~~~~~~~~~~~
         Then store the address of the found INT 21h in a double word
         location within your virus.
         
         You can then call the real INT 21h doing a CALL DWORD PTR to
         such location.

         All this is shown in YB-1.ASM and YB-2.ASM

         TUNNEL 4.1 procedure usage:

         INPUT:  bp=01                 => Search for original INT 2Ah
                 bp=02                 => Search for original INT 13h
                 Any other value in bp => Search for original INT 21h
         (you MUST save any necessary registers)

         OUTPUT: ah=00  Not found
                 ah=01  Found!
                 ah=02  Int 21h/ 2hA /13h Not Hooked
                 ah=03  DOS internal interrupts are hooked (search for
                 int 21h / 2Ah / 13h not conducted)

         If found:
                 dx=  INT 21h / 2Ah / 13h SEGMENT
                 di=  INT 21h / 2Ah / 13h OFFSET
                 al=  RECURSION DEPTH

                 REGISTERS DESTROYED: ax,bx,cx,dx,di,bp,es


         At infection time you must add 248 (decimal) bytes to the
         virus size. (see YB-1.ASM, YB-2.ASM)

         6. TESTING:

         The toolkit has been tested with a reasonable amount of
         hardware and software.

         Success for, loaded in the following order:

            DOS 5.00 (high) + Vshield 106 (McAfee)
            DOS 5.00 (high) + Vshield + Vshield 106
            DOS 5.00 (high) + Virstop (FPROT 2.09)
            DOS 5.00 (high) + TBdriver + TBfile  (TBAV 6.03)

            DOS 5.00 + Vshield (McAfee) + Virstop
            DOS 5.00 + Vshield (McAfee) + Virstop
                     + TBdriver + TBfile !!!!

         You can switch the order of the first 2. Tbfile won't let
         anything load if it is not loaded last.

            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM 6.0 (high) + Vshield 106  (McAfee)
            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM 6.0 (high) + Vshield + Vshield 106
            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM 6.0 (high) + Virstop (FPROT 2.09)
            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM 6.0 (high) + TBdriver + TBfile
                              (TBAV 6.03)

            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM (high) + Vshield (McAfee) + Virstop
            DOS 5.00 (high) + QEMM (high) + Vshield (McAfee) + Virstop
                            + TBdriver + TBfile !!!!

         KRTT is compatible MS-DOS and IBM DOS versions ranging from
         3.1 to 6.0

         The above results can be also reproduced against the
         following:

            VSAFE (CPAV / MSAV)

         Note that some of the above software developers costs $50+,
         all circunvented by a free 248 byte program!
