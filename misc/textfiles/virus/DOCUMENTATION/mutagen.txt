        ical mutation. - mu'ta-gen'ic (adj.)


        Yes, this is MutaGen, one of the most powerful polymorphic encryption
engines known to man. MutaGen is mainly designed for inclusion in computer
viruses or other such toys, but may be utilized for any purpose the user
wishes. 
        If you have not written viruses before, don't start with MutaGen.
Work on some good viruses first and then work with this program. This module
requires a good knowledge of assembly. Sometimes you may need to manipulate
a program a little to fit the module; if you have problems, observe the two
sample viruses and follow their example.
        Oh, and I don't particularly mind if you mess with this module, but
leave the "MutaGen vX.X MnemoniX" string in it.

                              - How to Use It -

        MutaGen is relatively simple to use; the module only requires a few
parameters.

        To use MutaGen, include at the beginning of your code the line:

                         extrn  _MUTAGEN:near

        Then, when the time comes, call it with the following parameters:

                DS:SI = address of code to encrypt
                ES:DI = area for encrypted code
                         - the decryption module can range in size from 
                           40 to about 180 bytes (usually about 70-100).
                           Include generous space for this module.
                   CX = size of code
                        - MutaGen v2.0 occupies 1938 bytes itself; be sure
                          to include this in the size.
                   DX = offset in memory where decryption module
                        will be RUN from
                         - that's RUN from; in other words, where this code
                           will be summoned in memory.

                After MutaGen is run, CX holds the length of the encrypted
                module with decryption code. DS:DX points to the encrypted
                code.

        Link with MutaGen, lather, rinse, repeat, etc. Examine the sample
Mutagenic Agent viruses included for examples. This version includes two:
MutaGenic Agents I and ]I[. (MutaGenic Agent ][ was included in previous
versions, but I dumped it in favor of the third one.) The first one is a
nonresident .COM infector that infects one file in the current directory
each run. It's not destructive, so don't be afraid to play around with it.
        The other virus is a powerful polymorphic stealth COM/EXE infecting
virus. It disinfects itself when opened so as to fool virus scanners, and
many CRC checkers will not even notice any change to infected files. It
also makes exceptions for SCAN.EXE and F-PROT.EXE and won't infect them.
But this is a powerful virus, so if you play with it, be careful.

                            - Miscellaneous BS. -

        For anyone who is interested, I am MnemoniX, a programmer and creator
of many viruses and miscellaneous electronic toys, located in western New York
State, U.S.A. I created MutaGen because I just wasn't happy with the other
encryption engines in circulation. Most of them are buggy, and scan as TridenT
50 percent of the time. I believe I have alleviated these problems in this
engine. I do not, by the way, intend to release the source code to this
engine.
        This version is the best one yet. I added many features that will make
this engine very difficult to scan. There are more calls and jumps added to
confuse scanners, and I fixed some bugs that would cause system reboots and
hangs (although to be honest I have no idea what caused them in the first
place.)

                               - Disclaimer. -

        MutaGen contains no harmful or destructive routines. As such, I, the
author and a generally amazing and wonderful being, take no responsibility for
any damage resulting from programs which may happen to implement MutaGen in
their code. You ran it, I did not ...

Revision History:

        .80á 1/94 - personal release
        .90á 2/94 - first offical beta test version released. Sometimes
                    scanned as TpE, contained minor bugs.
        .95á 2/94 - fixed bugs & made less scannable.
        1.00 3/94 - first official version. Functionally perfect, as far as I
                    can see.
        1.10 4/94 - Added more variability in code and optimized existing
                    code. Also added another demonstration virus.
        1.1b 4/94 - Fixed protected mode bug, I think. (Thanks Memory Lapse)
        1.2  5/94 - Improved code yet more, added more power & polymorphism.
                    (Also, the first demo virus no longer scans as Ash.)
        1.3  6/94 - Optimized some code and added more weird twists and
                    turns in the code.

        2.0  7/94 - The definitive version. I fixed bugs with the IN and REP
                    instructions that would occasionally cause problems.
                    Added many calls and jumps to make detection much more
                    difficult. If there is a next version, it will simply
                    be smaller.

        And so I conclude. Enjoy ...
