   GV1 v1.01 - Good Virus #1 v1.01 (c) 1994 By Stormbringer, Phalcon/Skism
     User-Friendly, Menu-Controlled Self-Replicating Encryption Utility!

WARNING:  THE AUTHOR OF THIS PROGRAM IS NOT RESPONSIBILE FOR ANY DAMAGES
          CAUSED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FOR THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM.  THE
          USER ACCEPTS ALL RISKS OF USAGE BY POSSESSING THIS PROGRAM.

        Good Virus #1 v1.01 is now released as freeware to the public.
Basics
~~~~~~
   GV1 is a simple file encryption utility that uses one of the strongest
encryption algorithms available today, the International Data Enryption 
Algorithm (IDEA).  It is memory resident, allowing the user to simply
press its hot-keys (CTRL-ALT-V) to pop up its menu, allowing the user to
encrypt/decrypt files at any time simply by entering the filename and 
password.  

   GV1 is also self-replicating, although ONLY AT THE COMMAND OF THE USER.  
If instructed to do so, GV1 will attach itself OR REMOVE ITSELF from .COM 
files as they are executed.  This gives it a flexability to be used in places 
where encryption programs are unwelcome and looked for, as infected programs 
will seem "normal" to all but the most expert analysts.  For example, many
governments have recently taken it upon themselves to limit, in one way or
another, the availability of encryptions to their people.  In some of these
cases, good cryptographic protection is completely outlawed and even searched 
for.  While a person in this situation may choose to use PGP or another 
established program, this can often be dangerous as one can simply look for
the PGP.EXE file.  GV1 is at an advantage here because it can be attached to
almost any .COM file and pass through normal inspections unnoticed. 

Main Menu
~~~~~~~~~
   Below is the main user menu of the virus, with basically two parts, the
Infection Modes and the Encryption Commands.  It is activated by pressing
CTRL-ALT-V from any text-based screen while the virus is in memory (which
happens the first time an infected program is run).

Infection Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The infection mode of the virus is selected while on the menu simply
by pressing N, I, or D.  When first run, the virus defaults to [N]one
and will therefore not infect (or disinfect) any files.  If GV1 is set
to [I]nfect files, it will infect any valid .COM files as they are executed
from DOS.  In [D]isinfect mode, GV1 will _disinfect_ any infected .COM files
as they are executed.  

SHOULD A PROGRAM EVER FAIL TO WORK PROPERLY AFTER BEING INFECTED, FOLLOW 
THE FOLLOWING STEPS: 
        1.) Reboot the computer.
        2.) Execute an infected program OTHER than the problem file.
        3.) Set GV1 to disinfect by pressing CTRL-ALT-V, then D.
        4.) Execute the problem file.  It should now execute fine.


Encryption Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   GV1 has two encryption commands, [E]ncrypt File and De[C]rypt File.
For each, one is prompted for a filename (include FULL path to file if it
is not within the current directory) and a password.  REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORDS
AND TYPE THEM CAREFULLY!  GV1 does no password checking and has NO backdoors.
If you forget or mistype a password, the file is lost.  Remember this when
you are using it - GV1 is very secure, and should be treated with care.

   GV1 creates no headers on the files, nor does it mark files it encrypts in
any way.  One advantage of this is that one can not determine _anything_ 
from a GV1 encrypted file, EVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS ENCRYPTED DATA RATHER
THAN SIMPLE GARBAGE.  However, this also means that you MUST get the password
correct the FIRST time to retreive your data, as GV1 has no record of the
original password and will "decrypt" the file with whatever password you
give it.

Extra Security Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   GV1 makes no backups, nor does it leave a "deleted" copy of the file it
is used to encrypt on the drive.  When a file is encrypted, it is encrypted
and no trace of its unencrypted form is left, making GV1 suitable for 
protecting even sensitive data.

Validity of This File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   I have included a copy of my PGP key, and have signed this document and
included a pgp-signed version of the executable for GV1 to enable PGP
users to ensure the authenticity of these files.  Future updates of GV1
will also be signed for verification with the key included in this file 
to ensure that the virus is coming from a secure source.
