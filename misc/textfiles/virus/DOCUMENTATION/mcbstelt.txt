Introduction
컴컴컴컴컴컴

  If you don't know anything about direct memory allocation, Memory Control
Blocks (MCB) and Terminate and Stay Resident programming, then this article
might be a bit too advanced for you.

  MCB Stealth is used to hide the allocated memory, by releasing the
memory before a known memory diagnostic program is executed. When the
program exits, the newly released memory gets allocated once again.

  When a program is executed (function 4B00h), the procedure is as follows:
    1. Check if the executed program is a known memory diagnostic program.
    2. Find the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in chain.
    3. Free the previously allocated memory.

  When a program exits (function 4Ch and 31h), the procedure is as follows:
    1. Check if the memory is released.
    2. Find the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in chain.
    3. Allocate the newly freed memory.

I would like to thank Clive Sharp for helping me with the English.

Checking if the executed program is a known memory diagnostic program
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  There are quite a few ways to check if an executed program is a known memory
diagnostic program, but I've used the following way:

  First I open the file, then I get the system File Control Block (FCB) from
the System File Table (function 1220h and 1216h) and then I close the file.
Then I compare the filename (offset 20h) from the system File Control
Block (FCB) against my list of filenames of known memory diagnostic programs.

  These files are known memory diagnostic programs:
    CHKDSK.EXE  DOS Chkdsk
    MEM.EXE     DOS Mem
    MFT.EXE     Quarterdeck Manifest

Find the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in chain
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  If a known memory diagnostic program is being executed, then I get the
segment of the first Memory Control Block (MCB) in the chain from Get list of
lists (function 52h), offset -02h. The following is the description of the
Memory Control Block (MCB):

 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
 Offset  Size    Description
 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
   00h     1     Block type: 5Ah if last block in chain, otherwise 4Dh
   01h     2     PSP segment of owner, 0000h if free, 0008h if belongs to DOS
   03h     2     Size of memory block in paragraphs
 컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  To find the segment of the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in the chain, I
add the size of memory block in paragraphs (offset 03h) to the current Memory
Control Block (MCB) and increase that by one, then I have the new Memory
Control Block (MCB). Then I determine the block type, to see if the new Memory
Control Block (MCB) is the last in chain, if it isn't I will continue the
process until I find the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in chain.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Free the previously allocated memory
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  To free the previously allocated memory, I add the size of the previously
allocated memory from the size of memory block in paragraphs (offset 03h) and
then I execute the actual program.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Check if the memory is released
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  There are quite a few ways to check if the memory is released, I use a
boolean variable, which tells me if the newly released memory has to be
allocated once again. If I have to allocate the newly released memory once
again I find the last Memory Control Block (MCB) in chain, as described above.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Allocate the newly freed memory
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

  To allocate the newly released memory, I subtract the size of the newly
released memory from the size of memory block in paragraphs (offset 03h) and
then I exit the current program.

컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
Final tips and tricks
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴-

  - You could make sure that the executed memory diagnostic program doesn't
    allocate your virus memory, but I don't find that necessary, because there
    is hardly any chance of that happening.
  - You could create a Memory Control Block (MCB) in front of your virus and
    just modify the PSP segment owner (offset 01h).
  - Look at the attached example.
