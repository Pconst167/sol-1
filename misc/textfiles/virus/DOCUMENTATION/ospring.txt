 OFFSPRING v0.8 - BY Virogen - 06/13/93

    Welcome to my latest viral creation. Don't blame me if you are an
  ignorant fool and infect yourself. Don't blame me if you "accidently"
  infect somebody else. Don't blame me if you rape your little sister.
  In other words, don't blame me for anything, and use this virus at
  your own risk.

    New in this version:

       - switched from a86 to tasm for better offset calculations
       - rearanged code so got rid of a few jumps
       - deleted alot of the encryption changing routines (for better or worse)
       - virus size changes by +50 bytes
       - fewer constant bytes in encryption
       - DI and SI switch in the encryption
       - that stupid activation routine has finally been changed, it now
         displays the virus name, and continusly flashes the lights on
         your keyboard while beeping and attempted print-screens.
       - virus size is smaller


  Type : PSRhA  - Parastic & Spawning Resident  - Encrypting
  Origin : Virogen's virus laboratory
  Eff. Length : 1127-1177

  Infection Method :  Once memory resident, the virus infects up to five
                     files in the current directory everytime you change
                     directories or drives. So, the files in the directory
                     you are coming OUT of will be infected. I decided
                     this would be the best way, maybe it won't be quite
                     as noticable to the victim. Anyway, it will first
                     infect EXE files (spawning) in directory, once all
                     the EXE files have been infected, it moves to COM
                     files (parastic).



                                   Your Faithful Comrad,
                                           Virogen
