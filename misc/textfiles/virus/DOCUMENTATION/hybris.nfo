Here's a virus that has been lying on my HD for quite some time
now, (uerm, like over 6 month ;)). It's really not a ready production,
but it's what you get ;). I am sick bored of seeing this code, so give
it your best fuck, I won't touch this anymore, ever.

Two routines in this code are not my code, but Priest and Stormbringers.
Priest wrote the randomizer and Stormbringer the critical-error-handler
routine. I had thought to fix this up and write my own code, but didn't
manage due to the lack of time. I thank Priest and Sb and give credits
where credits are due :-).

Previous versions of this virus has been released in the wild under atleast
10 (actually, more like 20 I think) different names, I don't quite remember
them all, but if some of these names are: Carpe_DiemII, HeartQuake, Petra,
Eternal_Hate, The_Unforgiven (I included the whole fucking text.. hehe),
Hallucinations in the heaven, Fuck_RatMan, [Lurve.Emma.PSFL], and things
like that..

Most of the viruses listed above has been highly destructive, but that's
actually removed in this variant since I won't dist this in the wild anyways,
so why bother? Some of them wasn't encrypted, some included fancy payloads,
some included stealth, some even had tunneling-capabilities (Thanks to
Satan's little helper), some has been debug-resistant, and well, the list
what those suckers did can be endless.. (they have though, fucked up my
computer over and over again :)).

If this is scannable or so by now, don't be suprised..   If it isn't
I sure as hell am suprised, bigtime.. Ah well, just alter the encryption-
routine and it start to plague the warez-puppies again :). (Hey, don't
forget the trashing routine, heh!)

If you btw get in trouble by this code, there is a remover against
this sucker in the AV-article..  and yea, as an extra bonus, the
infected file is kinda weird ;). . . that should be something to check
up if you like debug.. (Its kinda huge, so uudecode it, and then "arj x"
it and play.. :).
