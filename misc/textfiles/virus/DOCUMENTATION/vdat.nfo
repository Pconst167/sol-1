    Welcome to the "Who and What" of the virus scene. For years I've been
    reading .DOC .TXT and .ASC files about the virus and anti-virus
    scene. Those files are by now spread out across a lot of my diskettes
    and whenever I wanted to read something a second time I knew I had,
    I of course couldn't find it and ended up downloading it again.
    Finally I was sick and tired of it and came up with a solution. I
    combined everything in a hypertext format which I now keep on my
    harddrive. The initial release took me about a month and a half but
    hey, it was an improvement and I enjoyed doing it. Anyway, why keep it
    to myself? Here it is, use it if you want to, otherwise: trash it!

    Included:

    - Essays and papers on viral subjects
    - Viral terms & definitions
    - What kind of virus creation tools are available?
    - What kind of polymorphic or other engines are available?
    - What kind of pro virus zines are available?
    - 50 US State Computer Crime Laws
    - Interviews with VX and AV
    - Large virus tutorial section
    - Some miscellaneous virus stuff.
    - More and more......why don't you see for yourself?

    BTW: It is still possible that a few of the almost 700 hyperlinks are
    not "linked", this is not on purpose and will hopefully be corrected
    in any upcoming versions.
