 OFFSPRING v0.81 -BY Virogen - 06/13/93

    Welcome to my latest viral creation. Don't blame me if you are an
  ignorant fool and infect yourself. Don't blame me if you "accidently"
  infect somebody else. Don't blame me if you rape your little sister.
  In other words, don't blame me for anything, and use this virus at
  your own risk.

    New in v0.8

       - switched from a86 to tasm for better offset calculations
       - rearanged code so got rid of a few jumps
       - deleted alot of the encryption changing routines (for better or worse)
       - virus size changes by +50 bytes
       - fewer constant bytes in encryption
       - DI and SI switch in the encryption
       - that stupid activation routine has finally been changed, it now
         displays the virus name, and continusly flashes the lights on
         your keyboard while beeping and attempted print-screens.
       - virus size is smaller
  v0.81 - The virus now infects when a file is executed, not the directory
          or disk is changed. This should prevent possible problems with
          programs running while when the directory or disk is changed.

  Type : PSRhA  - Parastic & Spawning Resident  - Encrypting
  Origin : Virogen's virus laboratory
  Eff. Length : 1127-1177

  Infection Method :  Once memory resident, the virus infects up to five
                     files in the current directory everytime a file
                     is execucted. Anyway, it will first infect EXE files
                     (spawning) in directory, once all the EXE files have
                     been infected, it moves to COM files (parastic).



                                   Your Faithful Comrad,
                                           Virogen
