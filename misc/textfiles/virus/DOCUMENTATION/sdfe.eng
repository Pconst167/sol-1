  1   Licence

     1) You can include this engine in your viruses. Using this engine
        on other programs is not allowed! You also have no grants to sell
        this engine!

     2) This engine is not a virus! Its' just a module to help you to make
        polymorphic viruses!


  2   About this version of SDFE

     I had fixed a bug from last version! And I also make this engine more
     powerfull! Because I had added some code to make my engine more and more
     mutable... Well, this also make my engine biger than before! ;~)


  3   How to use SDFE

     1) SDFE can be used under MASM or TASM. It may not used under other
        assembler compilers.

     2) When you want to use SDFE in your virus, you must include the
        following...

        extrn SDFE:near,SDFE_E:near

        "SDFE" is the polymorphic module!
        "SDFE_E" is the pointer of SDFE ending!

     3) You will include the following when you need to encrypt your virus!

        call SDFE

     4) Link SDFE.OBJ together! While you are linking your virus to EXE file
        ! Dont' forget to add "+SDFE" at the command line!

     5) SDFE 's decryptor code will not over 1K! So you may reserve memory
        size if your virus will resident in memeory! Be carefull!


  4   Input parameters

     1) ES : Work segment. (ES must point to a free segment)

     2) DS:DX : Code to encrypt. Usually point to the head of your virus!

     3) CX : Length of code to encrypt. You can use "OFFSET SDFE_E" to get
             lengh.

     4) BX : Offset where the decryptor routine will be executed!

     5) AX : Length of garbage code before the decryptor routine!

     6) BP : Decryptor addressing mode...

        Bit 0 = 0 Dont' care addressing mode! (Used to infect COM files)
              = 1 Use CS to addressing! (Used to Infect EXE file or COM
                  files)

        Bit 1 = 0 Use 16's (10h) multiple!
                1 Dont' use 16's (10h) multiple!

        Bit 2 = 0 Use interrupt in garbage code!
                1 Dont' use interrupt in garbage code!

        Bit 3-15 = Reserved...


  5   Output parameters

     1) DS:DX : The address of decryptor routine and encrypted code!

     2) CX : Length of decryptor routine and encrypted code!


  6   Final Notes

     Hee! Hee! Haa! Haa! Whoa! Whoa! I must be crazy? ;_)

     Greets...

     Vlad : I like your magazine! Inside of articles are very good!

     TridenT : Mmm... How do you do? :_)

     Qark : Well... You are my first talker on virus channel! Should we
            be good friends?

     Omega : Nice to meet you on irc. Maybe I will see you at this channel
             and talk about some new virus skils! ;_)

     And greets to all virus writers! Thanks! I will try to do my best!
     Dont' hit me! Hee... ;~)
