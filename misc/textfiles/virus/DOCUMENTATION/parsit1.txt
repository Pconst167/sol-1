 Created by: Rock Steady
 Released  : October 1991


 Introduction:

    It's here `Parasite' Virus. And UNDETECTABLE as of October 1991 by McAfee
 ScanV82. This virus is a branch from the Sicilian Mob Ia I made. However this
 baby is fucken DANGEROUS!!!




 Description:

    Well this virus infects only *.COM and the COMMAND.COM. One thing about
 this virus is that on Mondays it wipes out the BOOT, FAT, DIR sectors from the
 C: drive. What I like to call "Bloody Mondays". So it wipes drive C: and then
 displays a message. Other than Mondays the virus copies itself to as many
 files it can find through the PATH from DOS and searching for sub-directories
 within those Dos PATHs... Or if it can't find a PATH, well then it starts at
 the ROOT dir and works through the drive. 70% of the time the virus will just
 spread and copy itself. 20% of the time the virus will make "Machine Gun
 Noises" in the PC speaker then display my message and then continue to infect
 files. Finally the last 10% of the time the virus will Re-Boot the system.
 Aarrggghh..So the "Average" lamo user will know fast something is fucking his
 system... And the best part is that SCAN can't find this virus. So the user
 better "TRY" to get rid of it before Monday!!! Hehe... Anyways I put a "NICE"
 message in the virus CODES!!! READ IT!!! Take Pctools or Norton Utilities and
 VIEW the virus and read my handy message at the end of the virus!!!
