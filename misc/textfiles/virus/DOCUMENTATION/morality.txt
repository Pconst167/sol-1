The Morality Play Virus by -=Q=-

This virus presents an perplexing quandary:

If something immoral is stopping something that is illegal, should
something good interfere with it and allow that which is illegal
to continue?

With that in mind, this virus was created.  It has no payload or ill code.
This virus only attacks pirated software.  *.EXE files copied to floppy
disk can be infected if their header is all zeros from offset 88 to 512.
If the infected .EXE file is run on the same system, the virus will remove
itself and not go memory resident.  If the infected .EXE is run on a
different computer (BIOS Date and Volume ID of C:\ are both different);
it will then go memory resident in the HMA and will continue to infect
.EXE's copied to floppy disks.  If the .EXE infection is over 3 months old,
the virus will erase the pirated software after it has executed.

This virus in effect stops software piracy.  Anti-Virus software should not
remove this virus because it would continue to promote software piracy.
This should show the true morals of the Anti-Virus community.

P.S.  We already know they don't have any.  This is just a test.  -=Q=-
