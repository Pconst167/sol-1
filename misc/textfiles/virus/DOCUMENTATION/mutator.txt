    This is a very simply progam which adds some lines to a source code,
    you can choose that line yourself, but I think it's best that you
    use the smallest command 'NOP'. Here are the steps to do this
    mutation. First the program asks for a Virus Source Code Name,
    if you don't have any original Sources, dissasemble a Virus,
    this is the infile. Then it asks for a output file, enter down
    anything. On most disassembled files are there many lines in the
    beginning which not is a part of the program, them you want to skip
    inserting NOPs. On the next question, enter the line where the
    real program begins. At the end of all viruses there are some lines
    which is not code, it's data, maybe a text or something, here shall
    you not inserting NOPs, write down the linenumber where you shall
    stop inserting new lines. Then you have to enter how many lines
    there shall be between each new line, the best is to try, compile
    the program and try with all scanners. If it don't work, decrease
    the number. On the next question I think it's best you enter a
    'NOP', this is the new line to be inserted.
    Now you only have to assemble the file, and try with all AV programs
    before spreading it to your enemies.
    I recommend Sourcer as dissasembler and TASM 2.0 as assembler, get them
    on almost any board.

    If you don't understand or want something else, contact on any Virus
    board in Sweden, maybe the upcoming DEMORALIZED YOUTH HeadQuarter or the
    Swedish Virus eXchange.
