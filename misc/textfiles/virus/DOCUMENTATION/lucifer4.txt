Hi.  This is Lucifer Messiah of Anarkick Systems.

This virus, which I called 'Lucifer Messiah's Boot Sector'
has gone through many different phases, and has been
released in a much simpler form 2 years ago in an
underground magazine called 'Guerrilla WareFair'.
I am surprised that the technology did not catch on.  Here
is why:

This virus is an overwriting boot sector virus.  It does not
need the normal DOS boot sector code to properly load up a
system.  Also, it doesn't care what type of DOS you are
using.  It will load virtually any DOS!

This virus will also infect virtually anything!  It doesn't
care if it is high density, or low density, or if it is a
hard drive of whatever size you could throw at it.  It can
handle ANYTHING!  This is no joke.

If the disk is a non-system disk, it will display an
'**Oops!**'.  I was originally intending on having it display
the normal DOS error, but due to the complexity of the code,
I have not yet been able to make the code tight enough to
fit this in, while still only requiring one sector.

The virus in this package is set up for a 360K diskette.
Just overwrite the original boot sector with this sector,
and you are finished.  Do it on a system disk for more fun.

Experiment like crazy with it.  If you find something it
wont successfully infect, I want to know about it.  I can be
found on RABNET.
