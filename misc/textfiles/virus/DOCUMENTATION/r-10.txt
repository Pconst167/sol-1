DataRape! is the first of a new-line of RABID memory-resident viruses,
programmed by Zodiac of RABID, USA.  Due to a large number of "busts",
the release of this virus has been delayed for too long.  Hence, this
version is being released as a beta-test of this virus.

DataRape! infects .COM files upon their execution by patching into
interrupt 21h.  It hides itself in memory by changing the PSP of the
"Free" memory block so it will not be overwritten and moves itself there.
Hence, no evident change in available memory is displayed.

DataRape! will destroy the FAT tables of ALL available disk drives,
regardless of whether they have been changed via the command "ASSIGN"
with a frequency of 1/50 after every file execution.  Therefore, the
program "RAPEV10.EXE" has been distributed so that one infecting a
program will not fall a victim.

Files under the size of 1000 bytes and those above the size of 63000 bytes
will not be infected.  This is done to complicate the lives of those
studying this virus, and to avoid potential hazards via running out of
allocatable memory in the .COM file.

The source code to this virus will be publically distributed 6 months
from the release of this archive.

Please feel free to infect anyone with this virus.  But in order to
prolong the "life" of this virus, try not to distribute it to the
authorities.  Quite frankly, I don't care and I know someone will
"trade" it away...  But that's the price I must pay for the 100+
hours that have gone into this project.  I'm not a particularly
malicious person, and I do not have a "vendetta" towards the computer
community.  I just enjoy programming viruses, as many others do.
That, to me, is what RABID is all about - a society of those who
like to program viruses.  You can stuff your egotistical "elite"
jargon down your throat as you wallow in the misery of your own
oppression, brought about by your own disgusting, miserable self,
or you can accept life and reality as they are.

To the anti-virus people, I must say a few words.  You should be paying
us money and not trying to "bust" us.  We're keeping you in your dirty
business.  Any of your efforts can be got around, because you, like the
pigs, are too stupid to realize our higher intelligence/motives.  So
leave us alone; you'll get more money and we'll be happier.
