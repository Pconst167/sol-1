        With the  release  of this  virus marks  the  absolute  end  for all
 boring  direct-action COM  infectors from  Virulent Graffiti... if some pop
 up  in  the  future, bearing  our  name,  and  do not have revolutionary or
 funny activation stages, they are NOT from us...

        Anyway,  I am  at a loss as to why I should use anything but the DOC
 I wrote for this, but,  here's what Patti says, and what I say, you compare
 and contrast who does it better!

 Virus Name:  Soupy
 Aliases:   
 V Status:    New
 Discovered:  January, 1993
 Symptoms:    .COM file growth; TSR; message; system hangs
 Origin:      United States
 Eff Length:  1,072 Bytes
 Type Code:   PRC - Parasitic Resident .COM Infector
 Detection Method:  Novi 1.15a+, CPAV/N
 Removal Instructions:  Delete infected files
 
 General Comments:
       The Soupy virus was submitted in January, 1993, and is from the
       United States.  Soupy is a non-resident, direct action infector
       of .COM programs, but not COMMAND.COM.  In the case of advanced
       infections, it may install a portion of itself memory resident in
       order to facilitate the activation mechanism in the virus.

       When a program infected with the Soupy virus is executed, the
       Soupy virus will infect one .COM file located in the current
       directory, as well as update a counter within the viral code.
       Programs infected with the Soupy virus will have a file length
       increase of 1,072 bytes with the virus being located at the end
       of the file.  The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory
       listing will not be altered.

       The Soupy virus activates once the counter within the viral code
       has reached 11, indicating the 11th generation of the virus has
       been reached.  At this time, the virus will install a portion of
       itself in memory of 736 bytes, hooking interrupt 08.  Once the
       memory resident portion of the virus has been installed, it will
       display the following messages one at a time every three minutes:

               "Unsuspecting user, 12 o'clock!"
               "Get ready... 'cause... THERE'S A VIRUS IN YOUR SOUP!"
               "From the guys that brought you Lythyum, Radyum, and
                VioLite comes:"
               "The Soupy Virus, (k) 1992 VG Enterprises,
                216/513/602/904/703"
               "By The Attitude Adjuster & AccuPunk!"
               "Hurry! Hire an Anti-Virus Professional!
                Increase Wallet Space!"
               "...hmmm, ya' know, I think I''ll halt now..."
     
       Once the last message above is displayed, the system will be
       halted or hung.  The above messages are encrypted within the
       Soupy viral code, as are the following additional text strings:

               "[Soupy] The Attitude Adjuster & AccuPunk,
                VG 08/23/92 to 12/02/92"
               "*.COM"
               "Bad command or file name"

 General Comments:

       The Soupy virus is a self-encrypting direct action infector
       of .COM programs. The virus, upon execution, will search the
       current directory for an uninfected .COM program. If none
       are found, the virus will restore the host file and continue
       execution.
 
       The Soupy virus mantains an infection counter. When this counter
       reaches 11, the virus will check for a copy of itself in memory,
       and if not found, make itself the owner of INT 8 and go
       resident.
 
       Approximately every 3 minutes, the virus will display the next
       of 7 messages, finally causing the machine to do a dynamic
       halt on the final message.
 
 ==========================================================================
        And,  just  to get  the story  straight, I  wrote  all the resident
 stuff out  of boredom, and, the  COM engine was what AccuPunk presented as
 his coding example to join the group. I just optomized the code, and added
 my residency, and I was ready to go... 

        This  virus sucks... mainly because I didn't know enough back then,
 but, that has all changed...
