 Mexican Mud is a nice little thing, but it isn't so hard to find cause
 everytime you execute an infected program, Mexican Mud fade down color 7
 one step. So when you have run 63 infected programs, color 7 is black!!
 This virus does only work on VGA-Monitors. If you don't have a VGA-monitor,
 Mexican Mud will only infect file(s), not fade any color.
