Matthew Stolarski - "A loser in deep trouble..."
YAM '92 - Youngsters Against McAfee

Programmer : Admiral Bailey
Language Used : Assembly [TASM 2.0]

Notes : The Matthew Stolarski was written because I was bored and this loser
        named Matthew got me really pissed off so I decided to write a virus
        about him.  If you ever see this guy apply to your board then don't
        let him in.  He will just start fights and cause troubles.  He may
        even try to hack your board for the fun of it.  But enough about him
        more about the virus.
        This is a com infecting virus that will kill all your drives during
        its activation span.  This virus has a three day activation span.
        It will be active and go off on the days of June 28th, 29th, and
        30th.  Basically because at my school they will be working on our
        school grades at this time and if they have this virus (And im sure
        they will) the markes will get killed.  HAHAHAH! It will search
        through all you directories and infect all com files if its not this
        date.
        As of Scan 89 this virus is not scannable.  And I will plan to keep
        it that way by updating it every time it becomes scannable.
        The source the the Matthew Stolarski virus will never be released
        because I realy don't want hundreds of strains to be maid off of it.
        But I may consider releasing the source in the future.

Future Plans : In the future I plan to enhance this virus a lot.  First I
               plan to make it incrypted so you cannot see the text.  I
               already know how I will do this but im too lazy to do it
               right now.  I plan to make it stay in memory but that doesnt
               really have any use to I gonna do that last.  Then finnaly I
               will make it also infect .exe files.  Why give the .com files
               all the attention.
