                              DWI Virus Source
                   By The Attitude Adjuster and AccuPunk
                            ====================

        Here's  the source to one of our new older viruses... Both 'Punk and
 I  did a  little bit  on this  one, but,  'Punk thought it all up... I just
 kinda fucked  around with  the code  when he  said he  was bored with it...
 Anyway,  I can't  really give you too much help here, as this code isn't at
 all the greatest, but, I include it to get this virus out into the world.

        Umm,  assemble  two pass,  and  link to an EXE. Modfiy the header to
 make  the maximum  memory  allocation equal  to the minimum, and the fucker
 should run...  I'm  really not  going to test it  right now, mainly because
 it's late, and I AM releasing this tonight...

General Comments:

        DWI will become resident after first checking for it's own
        presence in memory. DWI places itself into high memory, and
        changes it's MCB owner to the usual DOS MCB owner segment.
        This may be changed to retrive the DOS MCB owner from DOS,
        in the future, but this suffices at the present.

        Int 21h is revectored to Int 30h where the virus uses it for
        DOS calls. The FAR PTR at Int 30h+1 is lost.

        Upon the execution of any program using Int 21h/Ax=4B00h, DWI
        will check the file for an 'MZ' header, and if found, infect
        the file, leaving the time, date, and attributes of the file
        unchanged.

        DWI seems to have an adverse effect on WIN.COM when it is run.

        Other than the offensive WIN.COM program, DWI will not harm any
        data... If DESQView is found, the host system owner will be wired
        $100,000 for choosing a decent multitasking operating system...
        err... maybe not, but, we'll not screw any .COM files.

Future Revision Notes:

        There will probably be no future revisions of DWI. We may optomize
        it a little, and rip the engine for use in a planned virus, but,
        as I said, there will probably be no DWI-B.
