DTM - Dead to Minotauro BBS silly Trojan installer.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is a small program I wrote to eradicate a small nuisance this
magazine has, known as 'Minotauro BBS'.

This self-proclaimed BBS has caused a number of problems to our readers,
since logically they associate this magazine (Minotauro, get it?) with the
BBS of the same name.  We've asked him several times to change the name of
his system, but he just won't listen, as he's a Warez D00D  :0.

Very well, THIS BBS HAS NOTHING, I repeat.., NOTHING TO DO WITH MINOTAURO
MAGAZINE.  Unfortunately, the sysop will just not listen to reason, so we've
developed this little program for our readers.

The program is DTM, Dead to Minotauro BBs silly trojan installer ;).  It will
install a trojan into any .EXE you want.

The idea is for you to help us.  Take any '0-0 day Warez', add the trojan to
any .EXE in the program and upload it to the BBS, so that poor amorphous
thing known as the Sysop will enthusiastically execute it and watch as his
hard drive turns to, in a word, SHIT.  Though it doesn't seem likely, it
should work since the Sysop is not very 'brilliant' (we don't want to say
he's terminally stupid).  ;;;).

We are providing this program as a DEBUG script.  To convert it into an
executable .COM file, proceed as follows:

o    Eliminate all the text on outside of the lines that read "cut  here",
     including those lines, too, and save the file as DEBUG.SCR.  The file
     must contain ONLY the debug script.

o    Next, type  DEBUG < DEBUG.SCR   where DEBUG.SCR is the file you just
     created.

o    Done!.

If you did everything right, you'll create a file called DTM.COM.  It's very
easy to use: execute it and give it the name of the file you want to
"trojanize".

If you want to use DTM to fuck with some other BBS, I must warn you that the
message displayed when it trashes the HD isn't going to quite match your
intentions, since the trojan was written SPECIFICALLY for the Minotauro BBS.
But you can change the text using Norton Disk Editor (how lame, as the Warez
D00dz might say).

Also, don't fire off trojans to every BBS in the world (a stupid thing to do,
in my opinion), but if you have a GOOD reason, go for it!    :)

Well, we expect you to upload beaucoup trojans to Minotauro BBS and trash his
HD every time he gets it up.  Maybe he'll finally learn.


NOTE: A trojan was uploaded to Minotauro BBS (I won't say by whom ;)  ) and
apparently it's had its effect.  I've heard that board is no longer answering
.......  ;)

All the same, keep an eye out for him!
