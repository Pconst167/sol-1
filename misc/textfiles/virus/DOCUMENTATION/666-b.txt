                       Rock Steady `666-b' Virus                         
                 Released: May 5 '92 [Montreal,Canada]                   
                                                                         
Notes: This is a Simple EXE & COM infector  virus. The Virus will infect 
~~~~~  all files EXECUTED! (INT 21h, AH=4B) Virus will increase the file 
       size by EXACTLY 666 bytes! (Thus receiving its  name!) but if the 
       virus  is  Memory  Resident  while  doing a DOS "DIR" command ALL 
       infected files will retain the orginal File Length.               
Damage: As you can see this is a Stealth  Virus!  (Duh)  The  virus will 
~~~~~~  format  the  HD  Drive  C:  on the 13th of every month! I put in 
        TWO formating procedures, one  with the INT 13h and one with the 
        INT 26h, just in case any are being  intercepted. So you do have 
        a pretty  good chance of getting the  suckers  HD!  Leaving  him 
        with only "Invalid Media on Drive C:" to play with!              
                                                                         
Major: The Changes in this virus, is that the origal virus infected .OVL 
~~~~~  files which sometimes hanged the systems. Expecially with Windows 
       and QEMM! That didn't like Overlays to be touched, and fucked the 
       virus up. This was removed and the virus still remained to be 666 
       bytes long! But unfortunately  Scan 90  detected  it. As the scan 
       codes for both viruses are the same! So this one  won't  get much 
       of a chance to go round.                                          
                                                                         
                                        Rock Steady/NuKE
