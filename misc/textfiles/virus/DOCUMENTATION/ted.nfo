 TED is a program wrote for myself so that I could encrypt text easily and
 encorporate it into my own programs.

 What TED does is ask you for the text you wish to be encrypted (up to
 80 charachters), and it then XOR's the string with a value of 1Ah, and
 writes both the original text and the encrypted text into a file called
 ENCRYPT.TXT, so that I can later read in that file with my text editor,
 and easily throw the encrypted text into any program.

 As you may or may not know, when text is encrypted, it's a bitch trying to
 reproduce all those nasty extended ASCII charachters on your text editor,
 so this program takes care of that for you.

 Have fun with it. Oh ya, before I forget, it's a bad idea to make the string
 over 80 charachters, or else the program will die horribly when you try to
 write it to ENCRYPT.TXT.

 PS: If anyone wants the source code to this program, leave me a message
 on TGS, and I'll be more than happy to post it...
