<H1>Text Artwork: The DECUS Poster Collection</H1>
<P>
Comet has sent along the DECUS Posters Collection, circa 1985. Some of these show up
elsewhere, but together they represent the sort of designs and posters one could 
print out to hang on the wall of your computer lab or home. Overprinting plays a part
in some of these files, meaning there were no linefeeds so the printer would
print them even stronger, giving rise to near-true black and dark gray squares.
<P>
It is not fair to call these "ASCII", even though they are converted to ASCII; many of
them were in other forms first.
