 ASTRONOMICAL FORMULAE - [These are GREAT - no author! - S.H.]
 ---------------------

 MAGNIFICATION:  BY FIELDS
 M = Alpha/Theta

   where M is the magnification
         Alpha is the apparent field
         Theta is the true field

 Apparent Field:  the closest separation eye can see is 4', more practically
 8-25', 1-2' for good eyes.  The Zeta Ursae Majoris double (Mizar/Alcor) is
 11.75'; Epsilon Lyrae is 3'.

 True Field (in o) = 0.25 * time * cos of the declination
            (in ') = 15 * time * cos of the declination
            where time is the time to cross the ocular field in minutes

 A star therefore moves westward at the following rates:
      15o  /h (1.25o/5 min) at 0o declination
      13o  /h (1.08o/5 min) at 30o declination
       7.5o/h (0.63o/5 min) at 60o declination.

 MAGNIFICATION:  BY DIAMETER AND EXIT PUPIL
 M = D/d

   where M is the magnification
         D is the diameter of the objective
         d is the exit pupil (5-6 mm is best; 7 mm not produce a sharp outer
           image)

 The scotopic (dark-adapted) aperture of the human pupil is typically 6
 (theoretically 7, 5 if over age 50) mm.  Since the human pupil has a focal
 length of 17 mm, it is f/2.4 and yields 0.17 per mm of aperture.  2.5 mm is
 the photopic (light-adapted) diameter of the eye.


 DAWES LIMIT (SMALLEST RESOLVABLE ANGLE, RESOLVING POWER)
 Theta = 115.8/D

   where Theta is the smallest resolvable angle in "
         D is the diameter of the objective in mm

 Atmospheric conditions seldom permit Theta < 0.5".  The Dawes Limit is one-
 half the angular diameter of the Airy (diffraction) disc, so that the edge

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                 of one disc does not extend beyond the center of the other).  The working
 value is two times the Dawes Limit (diameter of the Airy disc), so that the
 edges of the two stars are just touching.


 MAGNIFICATION NEEDED TO SPLIT A DOUBLE STAR

 M = 480/d

 where M is the magnification required
       480 is # of seconds of arc for an apparent field of 8 minutes of arc
       d is the angular separation of the double star

 About the closest star separation that the eye can distinguish is 4 minutes
 of arc (240 seconds of arc).  Twice this distance, or an 8-minute (480-
 second) apparent field angle, is a more practical value for comfortable
 viewing.  In cases where the comes is more than five magnitudes fainter
 than the primary, you will need a wider separation:  20 or 25 minutes of
 arc, nearly the width of the moon seen with the naked eye.


 RESOLUTION OF LUNAR FEATURES
 Resolution = (2*Dawes Limit*3476)/1800)

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                 Dawes Limit * 38.8

 where Resolution is the smallest resolvable lunar feature in km
       2*Dawes Limit is the Airy disc (more practical working value: 2x this)
       1800 is the angular size of the moon in "
       3476 is the diameter of the moon in km


 APPARENT ANGULAR SIZE OF AN OBJECT
 Apparent Angular Size = (Linear Width / Distance) * 57.3

 where Apparent Angular Size of the object is expressed in degrees
       Linear Width is the linear width of the object in m
       Distance is the distance of the object in m

 A degree is the apparent size of an object whose distance is 57.3 x its
 diameter.


 SIZE OF IMAGE (CELESTIAL)
 h = (Theta*F)/K
 Theta = K*(h/F)
 F = (K*h)/Theta

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                
 where h is the linear height in mm of the image at prime focus of an
           objective or a telephoto lens

       Theta is the object's angular height (angle of view) in units
           corresponding to K

       F is the effective focal length (focal length times Barlow
           magnification) in mm

       K is a constant with a value of 57.3 for Theta in degrees, 3438 in
           minutes of arc, 206265 for seconds of arc (the number of the
           respective units in a radian)

 The first formula yields image size of the sun and moon as approximately 1%
 of the effective focal length (Theta/K = 0.5/57.3 = 0.009).

 The second formula can be used to find the angle of view (Theta) for a
 given film frame size (h) and lens focal length (F).  Example:  the 24 mm
 height, 36 mm width, and 43 mm diagonal of 35-mm film yields an angle of
 view of 27o, 41o, and 49o for a 50-mm lens.

 The third formula can be used to find the effective focal length (F)

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                 required for a given film frame size (h) and angle of view (Theta).


 SIZE OF IMAGE (TERRESTRIAL)
 h = (Linear Width / Distance) * F
 Linear Width = (Distance * h) / F
 Distance = (Linear Width * F) / h
 F = (Distance * h) / Linear Width

 where h is the linear height in mm of the image at prime focus of an
           objective or telephoto lens

        Linear Width is the linear width of the object in m
        Distance is the distance of the object in im
        F is the effective focal length (focal length times Barlow
           magnification) in mm


 (Star trails on film)

 The earth rotates 5' in 20 s, which yields a barely detectable star trail
 with an unguided 50-mm lens.  2-3' (8-12 s) is necessary for an
 undetectable trail, 1' (4 s) for an expert exposure.  Divide these values

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                 by the proportional increase in focal length over a 50-mm lens.  For
 example, for 3' (12 s), a 150-mm lens would be 1/3 (1' and 4 s) and a 1000-
 mm lens would be 1/20 (0.15' and 0.6 s).  Note that to compensate for these
 values, the constant in the formula would be 1000 for a barely-detectable
 trail, 600 for an undetectable trail, and 200 for an expert exposure.

 N.B. The above formulae assume a declination of 0o.  For other declina-
 tions, multiply lengths and divide exposure times by the following cosines
 of the respective declination angles:  0.98 (10o), 0.93 (20o), 0.86 (30o),
 0.75 (40o), 0.64 (50o), 0.50 (60o), 0.34 (70o), 0.18 (80o), 0.10 (85o).


 SURFACE BRIGHTNESS OF AN EXTENDED OBJECT ("B" VALUE)
 B = 10^0.4(9.5-M)/D^2

 where B is the surface brightness of the (round) extended object
       M is the magnitude of the object (total brightness of the object),
         linearized in the formula
       D is the angular diameter of the object in seconds of arc (D^2 is
         the surface area of the object)


 EXPOSURE DURATION FOR POINT SOURCES

            <Press  Home  PgDn  PgUp  Down Arrow  End  Q=Print>                                                                                 e = (10^0.4(M+13))/S*a^2

 where e is the exposure duration in seconds for an image size of >= 0.1 mm
       M is the magnitude of the object
       S if the film's ISO speed
       a is the aperture of the objective

 H = Theta - Delta

   where H is the hour angle
         Theta is sidereal time
         Delta is right ascension

   The Hour Angle is negative east of and positive west of the meridian (as
   right ascension increases eastward).

 ANNUAL PARALLAX

 Tan(pi) approx= pi = a/D  (by small angle equation)

 Where a = 1 AU or Astronomical Unit = 9.3E7 miles
       D = distance in parsecs

 The distance is therefore related to the parallax definition by:

   D = 1/pi

 The parallax is a measure of distance based on angular displacement of a
 star against much distant background stars over the course of a year's time
 as the earth circles the sun. (A similar affect is obtained by closing one
 eye, holding out a pencil vertically, and alternately closing and opening
 the opposing eyes. The pencil shifts relative to the background which in
 this case is the wall,window,woman, what have you. That is a parallactic
 effect, except the eyes take the place of a camera taking pictures when the
 earth is at opposite ends of its orbit.

 The parsec or PARallax-SECond is defined in terms of the parallax: The
 parsec is the distance a star has to be such that the Earth's motion around

 the course of one year. The parsec is 3.26 light years in measure and is
 obtained by conversion of light years or by taking 1/parallax value.


 STELLAR DISTANCES


 D(pc) = 10^(1+.2(m-M)) or rewritten as

   m = M + 5*Log(D) - 5

 Where as usual:

   D = distance in parsecs. Obtained by taking 1/parallax.
   m = apparent magnitude
   M = absolute magnitude

 m-M = distance modulus
