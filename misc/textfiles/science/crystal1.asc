                     Scanning Masers for Information Retrieval

       This file is  inspired  by  the  TV show, "Science Fiction Theatre".
       One of their segments had to do with  spying  on  a conference.  The
       method used was  unknown  and was traced to what appeared  to  be  a
       bottle of ant poison.

       The show used  the term "Crystal of Deception".  Unfortunately, I do
       not remember the EXACT technique although it can be narrowed down to
       only two.

       The first technique used a clear fluid  placed  in the bottle of ant
       poison.  This fluid hardened (crystallized) over time.  As the fluid
       crystallized, the matrix  thus  formed  recorded   the  sonic  waves
       present just as recordings are made in plastic or wax.

       The second technique  used  a  seed crystal onto which the new fluid
       accumulated.  Much like  the  saturated  solutions  used  to  "grow"
       crystal formations. Since the absorption was somewhat  regular  over
       time, it would also record sonic patterns.

       Of the two,  I  think  the  seed  crystal  technique  to be the most
       logical since the initiator of the  growth  process would already be
       present.

       By using M.A.S.E.R. (molecular amplification by stimulated  emission
       of radiation) energy  in  a  scanning  pattern,  the sounds could be
       recovered.

       When the molecules are excited,  they  produce  modulations  in  the
       audible spectrum which can be recovered much like radio  signals are
       broadcast on the AM (amplitude modulation) bands.

       Scanning is done  by  raking the focussed beam over the area in an X
       and Y pattern (vertical and horizontal  to  produced a 2 dimensional
       pattern).  Of course,   by   adding  a  Y  vector   (through   phase
       conjugation) we could scan a 3 dimensional matrix.

       For a twist,  the show used a rock which when scanned yielded voices
       and screams.  Of course, the rock  was  a  piece  of  lava  from Mt.
       Vesuvius and had "captured" the screams of the dying  inhabitants as
       the lava cooled.  A very interesting concept.

       Needless to say, the aggregation rate and the size and thus response
       time of the  particles  would  play  a distinct part in the clarity,
       fidelity and resolution of the recording.

       Note that Star Trek used a credit  card  size  piece  of  plastic to
       record both video and audio.  Science fiction it  might  be  FOR NOW
       but it does have possibilities.

       Also remember the  claims  of  Richard Shaver regarding what he said
       were images recorded in stone geodes by some ancient civilization.

       The geodes were sliced into thin  plates  which  could  be projected
       onto a wall to see the images.

       I have seen photos of these images and they are somewhat reminiscent
       of intelligible patterns.  By today's standards they  have almost no
       merit, however.

       Bear in mind  that most images, either audible or visual, are direct
       reproductions of ANALOG patterns (amplitude variations).

       This crystal recording technique simply points to another phenomenon
       that might produce a useable technology.
