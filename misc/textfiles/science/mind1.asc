                               by Tom Jaski
                       Electronics - September 1960

         In a  recent  editorial (August, 1959), Hugo Gernsback called
    for a serious reappraisal of the  effects  of radio waves on human
    and animal physiology.  In view of the almost casual  use of high-
    power radar and industrial RF (radio frequency) heating equipment,
    this is certainly a timely word of warning.

         It is  not  surprising  then  that  the  Air Force is already
    keenly aware of these problems, and has a number of projects under
    way to discover the exact effects  of  high-intensity radar pulses
    and microwaves on  human  and animal tissue.  These  projects  are
    being carried out  at our major universities, each specializing in
    one particular frequency.   For   example,   the  project  at  the
    University of California,  under  the direction of  Prof.  Charles
    Susskind, is primarily  investigating  the  effects  of 3-CM radar
    energy.  Test subjects are mice, ants, and yeast cells.

    Thermal Effects

         Of great   importance,   and    therefore   under   intensive
    investigation, are the  thermal effects of such waves,  and  these
    have been measured rather precisely under a variety of conditions.

         Using mice  as  subjects, it was found that near-lethal doses
    of radiation do  not seem to cause  any  pathological  changes  in
    them, and that the lethal effect is primarily an overtaxing of the
    mice's temperature-balancing system.  It was found  that the major
    heating effect took  place  immediately  under  the  skin,  but of
    course heat generated  there is rapidly  distributed  through  the
    body.  The temperature of the mice was monitored continuously.

         The photograph  shows  zoologist Susan Prausnitz  monitoraing
    the temperature of  a  mouse  suspended  in the wire cage right in
    front of the waveguide just visible  on  the  left.   The mouse is
    slowly rotated to  insure  even  radiation over the  entire  body.
    Death occurred in  50%  of the mice when a critical temperature of
    44.1 Centrigrade  was reached.

         Other interesting findings include  the fact that radar waves
    appear to have no significant effect on the fertility  of the male
    mice.  The effects of radar waves on the longevity of the mice are
    currently being investigated.

         An intensive   series  of  experiments  was  carried  out  on
    cellular organisms, such as yeast  cells,  but, other than showing
    thermal effects, the  experiments  with  insects   such   as  ants
    delivered relatively minor data.



                                  Page 1




         But one  interesting  item  which  emerged was that the ants,
    normally moving every which way, in a Petri dish, will all line up
    in a 3-CM field, aligning their  antennas  parallel  to the field,
    apparently to minimize the effects.

         The project is continuing, and more research  on  mice,  ants
    and other animals  is contemplated.  Psychological effects will be
    looked into.  One promising item  in  the ant experiments was that
    the ants which  were  exposed  to 3-CM waves apparently  lost  the
    ability, at least  temporarily,  to communicate the source of food
    to their fellows, as ants usually do.

         It may be significant that the  large ants used have antennas
    which measure very nearly one-fourth the wavelength  of  the  3-CM
    radiation.

         Incidentally, mice  are  so  frequently used for this kind of
    experiment because they are easily  handled,  easily  obtained and
    relatively inexpensive, while their physiology and metabolism bear
    a useful resemblance to human counterparts in some ways.  The life
    span of a mouse is limited, permitting experimenters  to  evaluate
    genetic effects over several generations.

         Meanwhile other  service  branches  are carrying out research
    programs concerned with the effects of radio waves on animal life,
    not necessarily limited to radar frequencies.

         A public announcement by scientists at the National Institute
    for Neurological Diseases concerning the LETHAL EFFECTS  of 388-MC
    radio waves on monkeys also shows there is great interest in other
    frequencies and effects BESIDES THERMAL.

    Some Early Reports

         As long ago as 1930, Nrunori  claims  to  have  seen evidence
    that the human organism "radiates" and "reacts to"  radio waves of
    2.33 meters and  its harmonics - in other words: 129, 258, 387 and
    596 MC (megacycles i.e. million cycles per second).

         This brings to mind the work  of a man who started publishing
    articles on this  kind  of  subject more than 35  years  ago.   An
    Italian university professor   named   Cazzamalli   placed   human
    subjects in a  shielded  room, subjected  them  to  high-frequency
    radio waves, and claimed to be able to record a "beat"  which,  he
    RECEIVED ON A  SIMPLE  UNTUNED  RECEIVER  consisting  of  a galena
    crystal, a small capacitor, antenna  and  sensitive  galvanometer.
    Cazzamalli's equipment, as well as it can be determined  from  his
    early articles, is shown in Fig. 1.

         The one  item  which  he  never  mentions, perhaps because he
    could not accurately  determine   it,   is   the   POWER   OF  HIS
    TRANSMITTER.

         He published oscillograms purportedly showing  VARIATIONS  of
    the "beats" when  his subjects were EMOTIONALLY AROUSED OR ENGAGED
    IN CREATIVE EFFORTS.

         Later experiments delivered  much  more startling results: he
    found that some  of  his  subjects  would  HALLUCINATE  under  the
    influence of the  high-frequency radio waves, which ranged all the
    way up to 300 MC.
                                  Page 2




         The Cazzamalli  experiments  were  carefully  duplicated with
    modern equipment, of  much  greater  sensitivity  than  his.   His
    "oscillatori telegrafica" (presumably a transmitter  as  used  for
    wireless telegraphy) was  replaced  with  a  very modest low-power
    oscillator.  The reason for this was twofold.

         In the first place, university  authorities  take  a very dim
    view of experiments  on human beings, even if these  subjects  are
    the scientists themselves, volunteering for the part.

         Second, a  previous  experiment  had  indicated  in  a rather
    startling way that POWER WAS NOT  REQUIRED TO EVOKE EFFECTS IN THE
    HUMAN NERVOUS SYSTEM.  In fact, there seemed to  be  SOME  SORT OF
    RESONANT FREQUENCY APPLICABLE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL HUMAN.

    Effects on Humans

         That experiment  was suggested by the behavior of the monkeys
    we cited.  These animals went through a sequence of behavior which
    would indicate that  something   besides   thermal   effects   was
    operating.

         To discover  if this "something" was subjectively  noticeable
    by an individual,  a weak oscillator swept through the band of 300
    to 600 MC with the request that the subject indicate any points at
    which he might notice anything unusual.   The  subjects  were  not
    allowed to see the dial.

         AT A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY BETWEEN 380 TO 500 MC FOR DIFFERENT
    SUBJECTS, they repeatedly   indicated   a   point    with   ALMOST
    UNBELIEVABLE ACCURACY (as many as 14 out of 15 times).

         Subsequent experiments  with the same subjects showed that at
    the "individual" frequency, STRANGE  THINGS  WERE  FELT.  Asked to
    describe the experience, all subjects agreed there  was a definite
    "pulsing" in the  brain,  ringing  in the ears and a DESIRE TO PUT
    THEIR TEETH INTO THE NEAREST EXPERIMENTER.

         The oscillator in this case  was  putting out only MILLIWATTS
    OF POWER, and WAS PLACED SEVERAL FEET FROM THE SUBJECT.

    Optical and Growth Effects

         It was  not  the  first  time  that such phenomena  had  been
    observed.  Van Everdingen,  a Dutch scientist, had discovered many
    years ago that radiation would affect  the  heartbeat  of  chicken
    embryos, when he  was  experimenting  with  the effects  of  high-
    frequency radiation on  growth  (specifically  working  toward any
    effect it might have on malignant growths).

         Van Everdingen used 1,875 MC and 3,000 MC and discovered that
    this kind of radiation WOULD CHANGE  THE  OPTICAL  PROPERTIES OF A
    GLYCOGEN SOLUTION.

         Glycogen is  a  substance  which  provides our  muscles  with
    energy!  Van Everdingen   found   that   this  change  of  optical
    polarization had some CONNECTION  WITH TUMOR GROWTH.  He proceeded
    to RE-ROTATE THE  POLARIZATION  IN EXTRACTS OBTAINED  FROM  TUMOR-
    PRODUCING MICE.


                                  Page 3




         When this  optically  "pure" substance was injected into mice
    with malignant tumors, and these  mice were kept on a diet free of
    animal fats, THE  TUMORS WOULD CEASE TO GROW.  Only  radiation  at
    UHF (ultra-high) or SHF (super-high frequency) would produce these
    effects in the substances he used.

         But Van  Everdingen  was  not  the  only  one  who discovered
    important facts about radiation on  living tissues.  Years before,
    a Frenchman name  Lakhovsky  claimed to have removed  tumors  from
    patients with high-frequency  radiation  treatments, and his book,
    THE SECRET OF  LIFE,  has a number  of  attestations  in  it  from
    grateful patients who were cured.

         Lakhovsky stated  that  healthy  plant growth  is  materially
    aided BY PLACING  A  COPPER  RING  ABOUT  8 INCHES IN DIAMETER and
    supported on an insulating wooden stick (Fig. 2) AROUND THE PLANT.

         So-called tumerous growths on plants disappeared withing such
    a ring.  Lakhovsky's experiment  with  plants  has been duplicated
    successfully.  But then we should also note that  the same kind of
    thing has been  done  by  a  group  of devout citizens using GROUP
    PRAYER!

         But the  people  who have published  the  most  data  on  the
    subject of UHF radiation effects on animals and human subjects are
    the Russians.  In  BIOFISICA,  the Russian biophysics  journal,  a
    scientist named Livshits  published  two  survery  articles on the
    work that had been in this field  by  1958 and 1959.  They are too
    extensive to repeat  in great detail here, but some  of  the  more
    impressive highlights will be reported.

         Many experiments were carried out on animals with conditioned
    reflexes, and one  by  Glezer  showed  that a WEAK UHF FIELD would
    INHIBIT THE CONDITIONED REFLEX, indicating that some inhibition of
    the cortex was taking place.

         As in  Van  Everdingen's  experiment   with   chicken   eggs,
    Pardzhanidze showed that  the  EEG's  of rabbits were  DRASTICALLY
    CHANGED WHEN THE  ANIMALS WERE SUBJECTED TO A UHF FIELD.  Bludova,
    Kurilova and Tikhonova showed that  the field produced AN INCREASE
    OF SENSITIVITY IN THE RETINA, and simultaneously  REDUCED THE AREA
    OF COLOR SENSITIVITY.

         It is  interesting to speculate how this would correlate with
    the Land effects.  (Land,  of  Polaroid  camera  fame,  has  shown
    recently that our concepts of three-color vision  seems  to depend
    primarily on the   presence   of  two  images  STIMULATED  BY  TWO
    DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES OF LIGHT!)

         Turlygin similarly showed that the sensitivity of the eyes of
    dark-adapted subjects at marginal  levels was INCREASED AS MUCH AS
    100% BY THE PRESENCE OF A UHF FIELD.

    Nerve Effects

         Of importance  in  the  light of Lakhovsky's  claims  is  the
    experiment by Grigoreva,  who  showed  that short exposures to UHF
    would EXPEDITE THE  REGROWTH  OF   SEVERED   NERVE  TISSUE,  while
    prolonged exposure would SUPPRESS THE REGROWTH.


                                  Page 4




         A fact  discovered  many  years  ago is that a UHF field will
    have an ANALGESIC (pain-reducing)  effect on nerves, and radiation
    therapy of patients  with  painful diseases such as  arthritis  is
    fairly common practice here and abroad.

         If the  field  gets very intense, the situation reverses, and
    the effects on the nerves can be extremely painful, as Lebedinskii
    reports.

         Numerous experiments  are   cited   which   deal   with   the
    simultaneous effects of  various  kinds of drugs,  stimulants  and
    toxins, and UHF  fields.   Many  of  these deal with very specific
    reactions and conditions, and any  generalization  would be rather
    meaningless.  One particularly  was  of interest  because  of  its
    relation to the  experiments of the late Pavlov, the father of the
    conditioned reflex.

         This experiment shows that the  field INCREASES THE SECRETION
    OF HISTAMINE IN THE STOMACH, and in related experiments  that  the
    secretion of digestive  juice which was artificially stimulated by
    such drugs as atropine is MATERIALLY REDUCED BY THE FIELD.

         Closer to home, we find that  Hugh  Fleming  at  Oregon State
    College carried out  experiments on the effects of  HIGH-FREQUENCY
    EFFECTS ON MICROORGANISMS.   Fleming used radiation at frequencies
    varying from 10 meters to 90 CM (30 to 270 MC).

         One result was that the RATE OF GROWTH OF CELLS WILL INCREASE
    to a certain power level, and then will SHARPLY DECREASE.

         TIME OF EXPOSURE and CONDUCTIVITY OF THE MEDIUM are IMPORTANT
    VARIABLES (as was also discovered  by  Van  Everdingen,  who  also
    found the VISCOSITY OF THE MEDIUM to be MOST IMPORTANT).

    Summing it up

         Now what  does  all  this  mean  in terms of Mr.  Gernsback's
    warning statement?

         If you  consider  the  few  items  we have been able to quote
    (more detail can  be  found  in   the   articles   cited   in  the
    bibliographhy), it is obvious that WE ARE IN SOME  WAY SUSCEPTIBLE
    TO RADIO WAVES,  and  that  our  susceptibility  IS  NOT NECESSARY
    LIMITED TO A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY.  Nor are large amounts of power
    required to produce some of the effects within us.

         But precisely what these effects  are,  we  understand not at
    all.  Van Everdingen points out that the possibility  of molecular
    resonance, AFFECTING THE CHEMICAL BONDS in our very substance.

         The egg   experiments   certainly   indicate   some  sort  of
    interference with the cortex (our  "gray matter") which MAY AFFECT
    OUR THINKING AND  OUT  CONTROL OVER THE "BASER" DRIVES  (generally
    considered to be generated in the lower sections of the brain, but
    normally controlled or inhibited by the cortex).

         Our physiological  functions,  such  as  our  digestion,  our
    ability to see and recover from  damage  when  nerves are involved
    may well be  drastically affected if we are subjected  to  a  high
    enough power level.

                                  Page 5




         Tumors may  be  inhibited  BY THE PROPER KIND OF RADIO WAVERS
    yet, in other cases, particularly  when  coupled  with the "wrong"
    kind of DIET,  radiation  may also PROMOTE THE GROWTH  OF  TUMORS.
    (This too was demonstrated by Van Everdingen in Holland).

         WE DO  NOT KNOW IF OUR LONGEVITY WILL BE AFFECTED.  Certainly
    we should consider  the  possibility   that   there  may  be  SOME
    RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE  INCREASE  OF CANCER AND  THE  AMOUNT  OF
    RADIATION we indiscriminately spew into the atmosphere.

         Or even  that  there  may  be  some  connection  between that
    radiation and our SHARPLY INCREASING CRIME RATES.

         We simply do not know enough  about  the  effects,  but  what
    little we do know would tend to make Mr. Gernsback's  warning  all
    the more urgent.

         For while  there  is nothing lethal about the doses of radio-
    frequency energy we absorb daily, neither is there anything lethal
    in the STEADY DRIP OF WATER ON  A  MAN'S  FOREHEAD  -  but  it was
    effectively used by medieval torturers to drive him completely out
    of his mind.

         Perhaps we have a responsibility to mankind,  before  we fill
    in all the  gaps  in  the radio spectrum, to discover once and for
    all if we are affecting human life  on this planet.  And if so, in
    what manner, as we finally had to do for another  surprise  out of
    Pandora's box, man-made radioactivity.
