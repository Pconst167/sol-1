   Responsibilities of Headquarters cover the determination of 
programs and projects; establishment of management policies, 
procedures and performance criteria; evaluation of progress and the 
review and analysis of all phases of the aerospace program.

   Planning, direction and management of NASA's research and 
development programs are the responsibility of program offices which 
report to and receive overall guidance and direction from an 
associate administrator.

   The Office of Aeronautics directs the agency's aeronautics 
research and development programs, including the High-Speed Research 
Program which is creating and refining the technology and addressing 
the environmental challenges supporting the development of a future 
U.S. high-speed civil transport aircraft.

   The office also researches advanced technology for subsonic 
aircraft, manages NASA's weather-related flight safety research, 
works to improve inspection methods for aging aircraft, propulsion 
research and development of advanced piloting and air traffic control 
aids.  In addition, it directs numerous flight research programs 
using high-performance aircraft such as the SR-71, F/A-18 and F-16XL.  
It also manages fundamental aeronautics research in aerodynamics, 
fluid dynamics, structural mechanics and human factors issues such as 
the interaction of pilots with highly-automated cockpits.  

   The aeronautics office also manages NASA's portion of the multi-
agency High Performance Computing and Commu-nications program, and 
NASA's part of the National Aero-Space Plane (NASP) program.  NASP is 
a national endeavor to develop and demonstrate technology for 
advanced vehicles that would take off horizontally, fly into orbit, 
then return for a runway landing.

   The Office of Aeronautics has institutional management 
responsibility for Ames Research Center, Mountain View, Calif.; Ames-
Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, Calif.; Langley Research 
Center, Hampton, Va.; and Lewis Research Center, Cleveland.  Dr. 
Wesley L. Harris is Associate Administrator.

   The Office of Space Science is responsible for the NASA space 
research and flight programs directed toward scientific 
investigations of the solar system and astronomical objects using 
ground-based, airborne and space technologies including sounding 
rockets and deep space satellites.  This office works closely with 
the scientific community through the Space Studies board of the 
National Academy of Sciences and other advisory groups.

   The Office of Space Science has institutional management 
responsibility for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.  
Dr. Wesley T. Huntress, Jr., is the Associate Administrator.

   The Office of Mission to Planet Earth is responsible for NASA's 
Earth science and environmental research.  Mission To Planet Earth is 
a comprehensive, coordinated research program that studies the Earth 
as a global environmental system.  Comprising ground-based, airborne 
and space-based programs, this office includes participation from 
other federal agencies as part of the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program and the international science community.

   The office has institutional management for the Goddard Space 
Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.  Dr. Shelby G. Tilford is Acting 
Associate Administrator.

   The Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications is 
responsible for assuring the health and safety of humans in space and 
to understand the biological effects of space flight on organisms.  
It also uses the unique attributes of the space environment to 
conduct research and gain new knowledge in fluid behavior, combustion 
science, material science and biotechnology.  Dr. Harry Holloway is 
the Associate Administrator.

   The Office of Space Flight operates the Space Shuttle and develops 
both manned and unmanned platforms which enable scientific research 
and advanced technology development. 



   The Space Shuttle is NASA's primary space transportation system 
and the only space vehicle capable of carrying people and large 
payloads into Earth orbit and returning them.  OSF is responsible for 
scheduling Space Shuttle flights, developing financial plans and 
pricing structures and providing services to users.  As part of its 
duties, the Office of Space Flight conducts operations and 
utilization of Spacelab, a laboratory dedicated to research in space 
that flies in the Shuttle's cargo bay.  

   The office is working with the Russian Space Agency to plan and 
execute a series of joint missions that will involve flying a 
cosmonaut aboard the Shuttle and an astronaut aboard the Mir space 
station, leading up to a mission with a Shuttle docking to the 
Russian space station.  The office also is conducting early planning 
activities for the operation of the U.S. space station.  

   The Office of Space Flight also is responsible for institutional 
management of the Kennedy Space Center, Fla.; Marshall Space Flight 
Center, Huntsville, Ala.; Johnson Space Center, Houston; and the 
Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Miss.  Jeremiah W. Pearson

existing systems capabilities.  The office has responsibility for 
space station development and operations; large propulsion systems 
development including a new space transportation main engine and the 
Advanced Solid Rocket Motor and advanced transportation systems 
program planning. 
   A permanently manned space station is essential for advancing 
human exploration of space.  The space station will be a permanent 
outpost in space where humans will live and work productively for 
extended periods of time.  It will provide an advanced research 
laboratory to explore space and employ its resources, and will 
provide the opportunity to learn to build, operate and maintain 
systems in space.  The station will be launched in segments aboard 
the Space Shuttle and assembled in orbit, with first flight set for 
1996.  NASA centers responsible for developing major elements of the 
space station are the Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space 
Center and Lewis Research Center.

   The advanced solid rocket motor is being developed to replace the 
redesigned solid rocket motor.  The ASRM will improve the safety, 
reliability and the performance of the Space Shuttle system.  Arnold 
D. Aldrich is Associate Administrator.

   The Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology has a mission to 
pioneer innovative, customer-focused concepts and technologies, 
leveraged through industrial, academic and government alliances, to 
ensure U.S. commercial competitiveness and preeminence in space.

   The office's four primary functions are to maintain a highly 
professional systems engineering team capable of detailed feasibility 
and cost analysis of advanced concepts, to be NASA's front door to 
businesses which want the agency's help and expertise in developing 
new ideas and technologies, to be the agency's lead in the transfer

AMES RESEARCH CENTER
Mountain View, Calif.  94035


   Ames Research Center was founded in 1939 as an aircraft research 
laboratory by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 
and named for Dr. Joseph S. Ames, Chairman of NACA from 1927 to 1939.  
In 1958, Ames became part of NASA, along with other NACA 
installations and certain Department  of Defense facilities.  In 
1981, NASA merged Ames with the Dryden Flight Research Center and the 
two installations are now referred to as Ames-Moffett and Ames-Dryden 
(see separate section on Ames-Dryden).

   Ames-Moffett is located in Mountain View, Calif., in the heart of 
"Silicon Valley" at the southern end of San Francisco Bay on about 
430 acres of land adjacent to the U.S. Naval Air Station, Moffett 
Field.

   Ames specializes in scientific research, exploration and 
applications aimed toward creating new technology for the nation.

   The center's major program responsibilities are concentrated in 
computer science and applications, computational and experimental 
aerodynamics, flight simulation, flight research, hypersonic 
aircraft, rotorcraft and powered-lift technology, aeronautical and 
space human factors, life sciences, space sciences, solar system 
exploration, airborne science and applications, and infrared 
astronomy.

   The center also supports military programs, the Space Shuttle and 
various civil aviation projects.  These projects and responsibilities 
will continue to evolve as NASA's needs change and Ames' capabilities 
develop.

   About 2,200 civil service employees and some 2,100 contractor 
employees are employed at Ames' two locations.  In addition, 
approximately 400 graduate students, cooperative education students, 
post-doctoral fellows and university faculty members work at the 
center.

   The Ames staff uses advanced equipment in their search for new 
technology.  This equipment includes aircraft and spacecraft, wind 
tunnels, large computer facilities, flight simulators and entry 
heating simulators.  

   The center's laboratories are equipped to study solar and 
geophysical phenomena, life evolution and life environmental factors 
and to detect life on other planets.  Capital investment at the two 
locations is more than $996 million, and today's estimated 
replacement value is more than $2.9 billion.  Dr. Dale L. Compton is 
Center Director.

   Ames Research Center was founded in 1939 as an aircraft research 
laboratory by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 
and named for Dr. Joseph S. Ames, Chairman of NACA from 1927 to 1939.  
In 1958, Ames became part of NASA, along with other NACA 
installations and certain Department  of Defense facilities.  In 
1981, NASA merged Ames with the Dryden Flight Research Center and the 
two installations are now referred to as Ames-Moffett and Ames-Dryden 
(see separate section on Ames-Dryden).

   Ames-Moffett is located in Mountain View, Calif., in the heart of 
"Silicon Valley" at the southern end of San Francisco Bay on about 
430 acres of land adjacent to the U.S. Naval Air Station, Moffett 
Field.

   Ames specializes in scientific research, exploration and 
applications aimed toward creating new technology for the nation.

   The center's major program responsibilities are concentrated in 
computer science and applications, computational and experimental 
aerodynamics, flight simulation, flight research, hypersonic 
aircraft, rotorcraft and powered-lift technology, aeronautical and 
space human factors, life sciences, space sciences, solar system 
exploration, airborne science and applications, and infrared 
astronomy.

   The center also supports military programs, the Space Shuttle and 
various civil aviation projects.  These projects and responsibilities 
will continue to evolve as NASA's needs change and Ames' capabilities 
develop.

   About 2,200 civil service employees and some 2,100 contractor 
employees are employed at Ames' two locations.  In addition, 
approximately 400 graduate students, cooperative education students, 
post-doctoral fellows and university faculty members work at the 
center.

   The Ames staff uses advanced equipment in their search for new 
technology.  This equipment includes aircraft and spacecraft, wind 
tunnels, large computer facilities, flight simulators and entry 
heating simulators.  

   The center's laboratories are equipped to study solar and 
geophysical phenomena, life evolution and life environmental factors 
and to detect life on other planets.  Capital investment at the two 
locations is more than $996 million, and today's estimated 
replacement value is more than $2.9 billion.  Dr. Dale L. Compton is 
Center Director.

Ames Research Center
HUGH L. DRYDEN FLIGHT RESEARCH FACILITY
Post Office Box 273
Edwards, Calif. 93523

    The Dryden Flight Research Facility is located at Edwards, 
Calif., in the Mojave Desert, approximately 80 miles north of Los 
Angeles.   The facility enjoys almost ideal weather for flight 
testing and is located at the southern end of a 500-mile, high-speed 
flight corridor.  Situated adjacent to Rogers Dry Lake, a 44-square-
mile natural surface for landing, the facility is in an isolated area 
free from problems of population disturbance or hazard.

    About 450 civil service and 510 contractor employees are employed 
at Dryden.  Capital investment at the facility totals about $135 
million and replacement value is $371 million.

    The facility's primary research tools are research aircraft.  
Ground-based facilities include a high temperature loads calibration 
laboratory that allows testing of complete aircraft and structural 
components under the combined effects of loads and heat; a highly 
developed aircraft flight instrumentation capability; a flight 
systems laboratory with a diversified capability for avionics system 
fabrication, development and operations; a flow visualization 
facility that allows basic flow mechanics to be seen on models or 
small components; a data analysis facility for processing of flight 
research data; a remotely piloted research vehicles facility and a 
test range communications and data transmission capability that links 
NASA's Western Aeronautical Test Range facilities at Ames-Moffett, 
Crows Landing and Dryden.

    Since 1946, Dryden has developed a unique and highly specialized 
capability for conducting flight research programs.  Its test 
organization, consisting of pilots, engineers, technicians and 
mechanics, is unmatched anywhere in the world.  This versatile 
organization has demonstrated its capability, not only with high-
speed research aircraft, but also with such unusual flight vehicles 
as the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle and wingless lifting bodies.

    The facility participated in the Approach and Landing Tests of 
the Space Shuttle orbiter Enterprise and continues to support Shuttle 
orbiter landings from space as well as processing them for ferry 
flights back to the launch site.

    Dryden is flying a specially instrumented F/A-18 to investigate 
high angle of attack, or high alpha, flight.  Today's high 
performance jet aircraft can fly in the high alpha flight regime, but 
not necessarily efficiently.  The facility's research will create a 
data base for aircraft designers to accurately predict high alpha 
airflow.  High alpha technology may result in airplanes capable of 
"supermaneuvers" and will help eliminate operational limitations 
imposed on aircraft designed without this techno-logy.

     Another high alpha program currently in progress at Dryden 
features the X-31.  An international test organization managed by the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is conducting 
flight tests to obtain data for next-generation high performance 
aircraft.  In addition to NASA and DARPA, program participants 
include the U.S. Navy and Air Force, Rockwell International, the 
Federal Republic of Germany and Deutsche Aerospace.

    The facility's B-52 currently is serving as the carrier aircraft 
for Pegasus, a winged, three-stage space launch booster.  Pegasus 
will be used to deliver small payloads into orbit.  The B-52 has been 
used previously to carry aloft and air-launch such vehicles as the 
famed rocket-powered X-15 and the lifting bodies, forerunners of the 
Space Shuttle.

    Dryden's F-15 is continuing flight research on Performance 
Seeking Control (PSC).  Using digital flight control, inlet control 
and engine control systems together, PSC demonstrates improvements in 
peak engine performance and maneuvering capabilities.  The F-15 also 
is equipped with a new computer-aided control system that will allow 
a pilot to maintain control of a crippled aircraft using engine 
propulsion to maneuver.  The ultimate goal of the program is to land 
the aircraft with only engine power.

    Extensive tests of Space Shuttle landing gear assemblies, from 
normal conditions up to and including failure modes, will be 
conducted using a CV-990 transport aircraft.  Information from the 
tests will help in developing crew procedures for various landing 
conditions and situations.

    Facility researchers are making preparations for the flight test 
program of an experimental vehicle of the National Aero-Space Plane 
Program (NASP).  One of three SR-71 aircraft based at Dryden 
currently is flying in preparation for possible experiments for the 
NASP.  Kenneth J. Szalai is Director.

GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
Greenbelt, Md.  20771

    This NASA field center, 10 miles northeast of Washington, D.C., 
has one of the world's leading groups of scientists, engineers and 
administrative managers.  It has the largest scientific staff of all 
the NASA centers.

    With its approximately 13,000 civil service and contract 
employees, including its facility at Wallops Island, Va., the center 
is involved in, among other things, research in the Earth and space 
sciences and the design, fabrication and testing of scientific 
satellites that survey the Earth and the universe as well as tracking 
satellites and suborbital space vehicles.

    Because of its versatility, Goddard scientists can develop and 
support a mission, and Goddard engineers and technicians can design, 
build and integrate the spacecraft.  Goddard also is involved in 
implementing suborbital programs using small and medium expendable 
launch vehicles, aircraft, balloons and sounding rockets.

    Controllers in the Payload Operations Control Centers maintain a 
24-hour vigil every day of the year for more than 20 orbiting 
spacecraft.  Spacecraft being watched include Tracking and Data Relay 
Satellites which serve as vital communications links between orbiting 
spacecraft and Earth through a Goddard-managed ground terminal in 
White Sands, N.M.  Two major telescopes, the International 
Ultraviolet Explorer, launched in 1978 and the widely-recognized 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) launched in April 1990, also are under 
the watchful eyes of Goddard controllers.

    So is the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in November 
1989.  COBE has provided scientists a whole new view of the cosmos.  
The spacecraft was designed to study the origin and dynamics of the 
universe, including the theoretical cataclysmic explosion known as 
the "Big Bang."
 
    From the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard, 
managers and engineers control the orbiting HST observatory and 
maintain an around-the-clock vigil from an array of consoles.  HST 
has accomplished a number of scientific achievements and, in spite of 
a spherical aberration in its primary mirror, has provided scientists 
with images of celestial objects in detail never seen before.

    One of the highlights of 1993 will be the first HST servicing 
mission.  The solar arrays will be replaced and several instruments 
and gyros will be changed out.

    The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), launched in April 1991, 
also is managed by Goddard.  Compton's mission is to study gamma ray 
emitting objects in the Milky Way galaxy and beyond.  Within its 
first 3 months of operation, the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment 
Telescope, one of four instruments aboard Compton, detected one of 
the most luminous gamma-ray sources ever seen.  The source of this 
radiation was identified with the variable Quasar 3C279 located in 
the constellation Virgo, approximately 7 billion light years from 
Earth.

    In spite of their size, Goddard's Small Explorer (SMEX) missions 
will investigate some of the most important questions raised in 
astrophysics and space physics.  The program will conduct focused 
investigations which probe conditions in unique parts of space, 
complement major missions, prove new scientific concepts or make 
significant contributions to space science in other ways.  The first 
SMEX mission, the Solar Anomalous Magnetospheric Particle Explorer 
was launched in July 1992.  

    Goddard also has developed an Explorer Project which provides 
moderate-sized missions in quick response to new scientific 
opportunities.  The Explorer Project includes the Extreme Ultraviolet 
Explorer, launched in 1992 to study a newly opened window of the 
electromagnetic spectrum called the extreme ultraviolet.

   The Goddard-managed Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), 
designed to collect, for the first time, data sets of the chemistry, 
dynamics and radiative inputs of the upper atmosphere, was launched 
on Discovery in September 1991.  UARS is the first spacecraft to be 
launched as part of the Mission to Planet Earth Q the NASA element of 
the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

    Future Mission to Planet Earth projects include Earth probes, 
such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission and the most 
ambitious science mission ever undertaken, the Earth Observing System 
(EOS).  The EOS mission, for which GSFC has the lead role in NASA, 
addresses pressing global issues, such as the depletion of 
atmospheric ozone and long-term global warming.

    Acting as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA)'s agent, Goddard procures the Geostationary Operational 
Environmental Satellite and TIROS series spacecraft and instruments 
required to meet NOAA's objectives.  Goddard also provides for their 
launch. 

    Goddard manages the U.S. portion of many international projects 
including two x-ray observatories:  the German Roentgen Satellite 
launched in June 1990 and the Japanese Astro-D launched in January 
1993.  Geotail, developed for Japan in support of Goddard's 
International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Project, was launched in 1992 
to better understand the interaction of the sun, the Earth's magnetic 
field and the Van Allen radiation belts.

    Much of the center's theoretical research is conducted at the 
Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City.  Operated in 
close association with area universities, the institute provides 
support research in geophysics, astrophysics, astronomy and 
meteorology.

    The scientific data from these and other space flight experiments 
are catalogued and archived at the National Space Science Data Center 
at Goddard in the form of magnetic tapes, microfilm and photographic 
prints to satisfy the thousands of requests each year from the 
scientific community.  Dr. John M. Klineberg is Center Director.

LYNDON B. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER
Houston, Texas 77058

    Johnson Space Center is located on NASA Road 1, adjacent to Clear 
Lake, and about 20 miles southeast of downtown Houston via Interstate 
45.  Additional facilities are located at nearby Ellington Field, 
approximately 7 miles north of the center.

    Johnson Space Center was established in September 1961 as NASA's 
primary center for design, development and testing of spacecraft and 
associated systems for manned flight; selection and training of 
astronauts; planning and conducting manned missions; and extensive 
participation in the medical, engineering and scientific experiments 
carried aboard space flights.

    Johnson has program management responsibility for the Space 
Shuttle program, the nation's current manned space flight program.  
Johnson also has a major responsibility for the development of the 
space station, a permanently manned, Earth-orbiting facility to be 
constructed in space and operable within the decade.  The center will 
be responsible for the interfaces between the space station and the 
Space Shuttle and flight operations of both.

    Johnson also is responsible for direction of operations at the 
White Sands Test Facility (WSTF), located on the western edge of the 
U.S. Army White Sands Missile Range at Las Cruces, N.M.  WSTF 
supports the Space Shuttle
propulsion system, power system and materials testing.

    Most of the 100 buildings situated on the 1,620 acre Johnson site 
are office space and laboratories, with some dedicated to astronaut 
training and mission operations.  

    Among the specialized training facilities are the Shuttle 
simulators (bldg. 5); Space Shuttle Orbiter Trainer, the Manipulator 
Development Facility, Precision Air Bearing Facility and Space 
Station mockups (Bldg. 9 North); and the Weightless Environment 
Training Facility (Bldg. 29).  The Mission Control Center (Bldg. 30), 
where all human space flights are monitored, is located at the center 
of the complex.  The Space Station Control Center was completed in 
November 1991 and will be ready to support integrated training in 
mid-1995.

    Life sciences, planetary and Earth sciences, robotics, artificial 
intelligence and lunar samples are a few of the research areas in the 
16 facilities dedicated to space and life sciences.
    Engineering facilities include vacuum chambers, an anechoic 
chamber, antenna range, avionics testing and various structural and 
environmental test areas housed in 22 buildings.  Aaron Cohen is 
Center Director.

JOHN F. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER
Kennedy Space Center, Fla. 32899

   Located on Florida's central Atlantic coast, the Kennedy Space 
Center (KSC) is NASA's principal launch base.  It occupies 140,000 
(56,568 hectares) acres of land and water on Merritt Island,  the 
adjacent coastal strand,  and the Indian and Banana Rivers and 
Mosquito Lagoon by which the center is surrounded.  The NASA holdings 
include 84,031 acres (34,007 hectares), the remainder is owned by the 
State of Florida but controlled by NASA under deeds of dedication.  
Robert L. Crippen is Director.

   KSC's eastern boundary fronts on the Atlantic Ocean and the 
center's large area (about one-fifth the size of Rhode Island) is 
surrounded by water, providing ample safety to the surrounding 
communities during launches, landings and other hazardous operations.

   Only a small portion of KSC is used for space operations; the 
balance is managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior as a 
wildlife refuge and national seashore.

   The  center was established in the early 1960s as the launch site 
for the Apollo lunar landing missions.  KSC pioneered the mobile 
launch technique in which space vehicles are built up inside 
protective structures and moved to their launch pads a short time 
before launch, reducing their exposure to the corrosive sea shore 
environment to the minimum.

   After the Apollo program was concluded in 1972, KSC's Complex 39 
was used for the launch of four Skylab missions and for the Apollo 
spacecraft for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.

   The center's facilities were modified for the Space Shuttle 
program in the mid to late 1970s.  The Shuttle era began with the 
launch of the STS-1 mission on April 12, 1981.  As of the beginning 
of 1993, more than 50 Shuttle missions had been launched and the 
current forecast calls for the launch of approximately eight missions 
per year from KSC's twin pads.

   KSC is NASA's prime center for the test, checkout and launch of  
payloads and space vehicles.  This includes launch of manned vehicles 
at KSC and oversight of NASA missions launched on unmanned vehicles 
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., and Vandenberg Air Force 
Base (VAFB) in California.

   The  center is responsible for the assembly, checkout and launch 
of Space Shuttle vehicles and their payloads, landing operations and 
turn-around of Shuttle orbiters between missions, as well as 
preparation and launch of unmanned Scout vehicles from VAFB.  KSC 
also is responsible for the operation of the KSC Vandenberg Launch 
Site Resident Office located at VAFB.

LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER
Hampton, Va.  23681-0001


   Langley Research Center occupies 787 acres of government-owned 
land and shares aircraft runways, utilities and some facilities with 
Langley Air Force Base.  An additional 3,200-acre marshland is under 
permit to NASA and is used as a drop zone for model aircraft tests.

   Langley's primary mission is basic research in aeronautics and 
space technology.  Major research fields include aerodynamics, 
materials, structures, flight controls, information systems, 
acoustics, aeroelasticity, atmospheric sciences and nondestructive 
evaluation.

   Approximately 60 percent of Langley's work is in aeronautics, 
working to improve today's aircraft and to develop concepts and 
technology for future aircraft.  Over 40 wind tunnels, other unique 
research facilities and testing techniques as well as computer 
modeling capabilities aid in the investigation of the full flight 
range Q from general aviation and transport aircraft through 
hypersonic vehicles.

   Langley's goal is to develop technologies to enable aircraft to 
fly faster, farther, safer and to be more maneuverable, quieter, less 
expensive to manufacture and more energy efficient. 

   Researchers are studying improved flight control systems to aid 
aircraft in 

operating more efficiently in all kinds of weather and in crowded 
terminal airways.  In cooperation with the FAA, Langley is examining 
wind shear, the cause of nearly 40 percent of U.S. airline fatalities 
in a recent several-year period.

   The National Aero-Space Plane is challenging Langley researchers 
to expand the limits in hypersonic (Mach 5-25) engines, heat-
resistant materials and supercomputers for engine and airframe 
design.  Improvements in supersonic (Mach 1-5) engine performance, 
fabrication of composite materials and laminar flow airfoil 
technology are spawning a new era in long-distance air travel.  
Passengers in the next century will 
benefit from current research programs at Langley.

   The additional 40 percent of Langley's work supports the national 
space programs.  Researchers study atmospheric and Earth sciences, 
develop technology for advanced space transportation systems, conduct 
research in laser energy conversion techniques for space applications 
and provide the focal point for design studies for large space 
systems technology and space station activities.

   Langley researchers performed extensive work on the structure, 
aerodynamics and thermal protection system for the Space Shuttle.

   Langley also manages an extensive program in atmospheric sciences, 
seeking a more detailed understanding of the origins, chemistry and 
transport mech-anisms that govern the Earth's atmospheric data using 
aircraft, balloon and land- and space-based remote sensing 
instruments designed, developed and fabricated at Langley.

   The center is contributing to the conceptual design phase of the 
Earth Observing System, the first stage of the international Mission 
To Planet Earth.  The system envisions a network of up to five 
equatorial and four polar orbiting research satellites.

     Langley has been named lead center for management of the 
agency's technology development program for the future High Speed 
Civil transport program.  Langley will manage high-speed technology 
in areas of aerodynamic performance, airframe materials and 
structures, the flight deck and airframe systems integration.
   The Langley Research Center, established in 1917 as the first 
national civil aeronautical laboratory, has been instrumental in 
shaping aerospace history for over 7 decades.  Paul F. Holloway is 
Center Director.

LEWIS RESEARCH CENTER
21000 Brookpark Road
Cleveland, Ohio  44135

   NASA's Lewis Research Center occupies 350 acres of land adjacent 
to the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, some 20 miles 
southwest of Cleveland, Ohio.

   More than 140 buildings comprise the center which is staffed by 
about 2,800 government employees and some 2,200 on-site contractors.  
Additional facilities are located at Plum Brook Station, about 3 
miles south of Sandusky, Ohio.

   The center was established in 1941 by the National Advisory 
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).  Named for George W. Lewis, NACA's 
Director of Research from 1924 to 1947, the center developed an 
international reputation for its research on jet propulsion systems.

   Lewis is NASA's lead center for research, technology, and 
development in aircraft propulsion, space propulsion, space power, 
and satellite communications.

   The center has been advancing propulsion technology to enable 
aircraft to fly faster, farther and higher, and also focused its 
research on fuel economy, noise abatement, reliability and reduced 
pollution.

   The center pioneered efforts in the use of high energy fuels for 
both air breathing and space propulsion.  Projects demonstrated the 
practicality of liquid hydrogen as a fuel leading to its use in the 
Apollo and the Space Shuttle programs as prime examples.

   Lewis has responsibility for developing the power system to

GEORGE C. MARSHALL SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
Huntsville, Ala. 35812

   The George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is located on 
1,800 acres inside the U. S. Army's Redstone Arsenal at Huntsville, 
Ala.  The center has about 3,650 civil service employees.  Of this 
number, more than 65 percent are scientists and engineers and more 
than 15 percent are business professionals.  The remainder consists 
of technicians and administrative and clerical support personnel.

   Marshall was officially dedicated by President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower on July 1, 1960, by the transfer to NASA of part of the 
Army Ballistic Missile Agency.  The center is named for former 
Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense and Army World War II Chief 
of Staff, General of the Army George C. Marshall.  The center's first 
director was Dr. Wernher von Braun, the noted German rocket 
scientist. 

   Marshall manages three government-owned, contractor-operated 
facilities for NASA:  the Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans 
where the Space Shuttle external tanks are made; the Slidell Computer 
Complex in Slidell, La., which provides computer services support to 
Michoud; and the new Advanced Solid Rocket Motor development and 
assembly facility at Yellow Creek, near Iuka, Miss.

   In the past, Marshall has been identified primarily as NASA's 
launch vehicle development center.  Today, this describes but one 
facet of the center's multi-faceted operation.  Marshall is a multi-
project management, scientific and engineering research and 
development establishment, with emphasis on projects involving 
investigation and application of space technologies to the solution 
of problems on Earth as well as in space.  Marshall also plays a key 
role in many NASA mission operations.

   Marshall had a significant role in the development of the Space 
Shuttle and continues to manage the Space Shuttle main engines, the 
external tanks that carry liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for those 
engines, and the solid rocket boosters that, together with the 
engines, lift the Shuttle into orbit.

   Additionally, Marshall is managing development of the Advanced 
Solid Rocket Motor, planned to replace the current Shuttle Redesigned 
Solid Rocket Motors in the late-1990s.

   The center has a key role in the development of scientific 
payloads and experiments to be flown aboard the Shuttle.  Many of 
these multidisciplinary payloads are flown on Spacelab, a reusable, 
modular research facility carried in the Shuttle's cargo bay.

   The center operates NASA's Spacelab Mission Operations Control 
Center, a new, state-of-the-art facility from which all NASA-managed 
Spacelab missions are controlled.

   To prepare crew members for Marshall-managed Spacelab missions, 
the center also operates a Payload Crew Training Complex.  Here, 
science crews train in Shuttle and Spacelab simulators to conduct the 
research they will perform in space.

   The center managed the development and initial orbital checkout of 
the Hubble Space Telescope, now orbiting above the Earth and relaying 
a wealth of new knowledge about the universe from distant galaxies to 
neighboring planets.  Marshall also is managing the Advanced X-ray 
Astrophysics Facility, a project with two observatories that will 
provide detailed, long-term study of x-ray emissions from the 
universe and the phenomena that produce them.  These include some of 
the most violent processes in nature Q the birth and death of stars 
and galaxies, spinning neutron stars, quasars and black holes.

   Marshall manages two space transfer vehicle systems, the Inertial 
Upper Stage (IUS) and the Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS).  The IUS, a 
two-stage rocket, places spacecraft in high-Earth orbits or on escape 
trajectories for planetary missions.  The single-stage TOS is 
intended to boost satellites such as the Advanced Communications 
Technology Satellite into geosynchronous transfer orbit and in 1992, 
was used in launching the Mars Observer spacecraft into an 
interplanetary trajectory.

   The Marshall center manages one of the three work packages for the 
space station, including developing and producing the U.S. laboratory 
and habitation modules and the environmental control and life support 
systems.

   The Marshall center is strongly committed to investigating the 
processing of materials in space and working in a microgravity 
environment.  These endeavors promise to increase the understanding 
of materials and improve Earth-based processes.  Center Director is 
Thomas J. "Jack" Lee.

JOHN C. STENNIS SPACE CENTER
Stennis Space Center, Miss. 39529

   NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center (SSC), located in Hancock 
County near Bay St. Louis, Miss., has grown over the past 30 years 
into NASA's premier center for testing large rocket propulsion 
systems for the Space Shuttle and future generations of launch 
vehicles.  Additionally, the center has developed into a scientific 
community actively engaged in research and development programs 
involving space, oceans and Earth.

   Approximately 14,000 acres make up the operations complex, which 
includes an industrial laboratory and specialized engineering 
facilities to support engine testing.  A significant advantage of the 
facility is the availability of all forms of transportation, 
including a direct water transportation route to the Gulf of Mexico 
and through the Intracoastal Waterway to the Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida.  Surrounding the operations complex is an almost 125,000-
acre acoustical buffer zone held under restrictive easement by NASA 
to muffle the loud, low-frequency noise produced during static tests.

     Since 1975, SSC's primary mission has been the research and 
development and the flight acceptance testing of the Space Shuttle 
main engines.  The data accumulated from these ground tests, which 
simulate flight profiles, are analyzed to ensure that engine 
performance is acceptable and that the required thrust will be 
delivered in the critical ascent phase of Shuttle flights.  Static 
testing is conducted on the same concrete and steel stands used from 
1966 to 1970 to captive-fire all first and second stages of the 
Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo manned lunar landing and Skylab 
programs.

   SSC also is involved in several other emerging test programs and 
activities, one of which is the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) 
program.  With the onset of ASRM testing planned for 1996, SSC will 
be totally responsible for proving that the Space Shuttle's main 
propulsion systems are flightworthy.

   The center also is gearing up for the Space Transportation Main 
Engine (STME) program.  SSC will test much of the STME propulsion 
hardware beginning with the turbopumps at the center's Component Test 
Facility.
   The High Heat Flux Facility at SSC will test materials in support 
of the National Aero-Space Plane.  In the future, SSC's role in NASP 
testing may be increased to include expansion of the facility for 
testing the plane's thermal structure.

   SSC personnel also are involved in scientific research, remote 
sensing technology and applications, and technology transfer.  The 
center has been designated as NASA's lead center for the 
commercialization of remote sensing technology and as such, work with 
the public and private sectors to expand the use of remote sensing 
imagery and technology.

   SSC is somewhat unique in NASA in that the center also serves as 
host to 18 other federal and state agencies and university elements 
in residence involved in environmental and oceanographic programs.  
Approximately 4,100 people are employed at SSC.  Roy S. Estess is the 
Director.

research.  Approximately 150-200 test operations, concentrating on 
aircraft/airport interface and aircraft operating problems research, 
are conducted each year at the research airport.  

   Wallops aircraft also are used to support applications and 
scientific research missions that are developing new instruments, 
providing ground truth data for satellite measurements and conducting 
field experiments.  

   Wallops provides support including launching, tracking, aircraft 
flights and data reduction to various segments of DOD, other 
agencies, commercial, international and educational ventures.

   Wallops plans and conducts Earth and ocean physics, ocean 
biological and atmospheric science field experiments, satellite 
correlative measurements and developmental projects for new remote 
sensor systems.  The main thrust of this effort is in support of the 
Laboratory for Hydrospheric Processes.

NASA Select Television

   The television service of NASA is an agency-wide TV-audio system 
offering a wide range of programming and coverage of NASA events via 
satellite.  During Space Shuttle missions, the system provides 
realtime air-to-ground communications between the orbiter and mission 
control, public affairs commentary from launch to landing and news 
briefings.  Unless noted, all programming carried on NASA Select may 
be taped for re-broadcast and other uses.

   The system also is used for other NASA briefings and events.  For 
most press briefings, the system is interactive (one-way video, two-
way audio) between centers so that media covering an event from one 
center may ask questions at a briefing originating from another.

   In addition to live mission coverage and press briefings, NASA 
Select offers informational and educational programming on space and 
related topics and updates on all of NASA's projects.  Historical 
documentaries focusing on great moments in America's space program 
also are featured, as well as recurring science as received from 
Galileo, Mars Observer, Ulysses, Hubble and other spacecraft.

   The programming starts at noon Eastern time, Monday through 
Friday, and is shown in 4-hour blocks (repeated at 4 p.m., 8 p.m. and 
midnight).  Within these 4 hour blocks, at 2 p.m., 6 p.m., 10 p.m. 
and 2 a.m. are programs containing material specifically suitable for 
classroom use.  Live programs such as press conferences and mission 
coverage take precedence over regularly scheduled programming.

   NASA Select coverage is carried on a full satellite transponder as 
follows:
 Satcom F-2R, transponder 13, C-band
 Orbital Position: 72 degrees W. long.
 Frequency:  3960.0 MHz
 Vertical polarization
 Audio monaural:  6.8 MHz

   NASA Select video also is available at the AT&T Switching Center, 
Television Operation Control (TVOC), Washington, D.C., and the 
following NASA locations:

      NASA Headquarters
      Ames Research Center
      Dryden Flight Research Facility
      Goddard Space Flight Center
      Jet Propulsion Laboratory
      Johnson Space Center
      Kennedy Space Center
      Langley Research Center
      Marshall Space Flight Center
      Stennis Space Center

   For Space Shuttle missions, updated NASA Select TV schedules may 
be obtained by calling COMSTOR, 713/483-5817.  COMSTOR is a computer 
data base service requiring the use of a telephone modem.  
   For additional information concering NASA Select, contact Deborah 
Rivera, NASA Headquarters, 202/358-1743.

Television

   NASA Headquarters produces a 14 1/2-minute "magazine format" 
videotape quarterly called "Aeronautics and Space Report."  The 
program is available to TV stations via satellite NASA Select and KU 
Band.  It also is uplinked to NASA field centers via the NASA Select 
TV system.  As an aid to broadcasters wishing to excerpt portions of 
this videotape for news programming, both audio channels are used.  
Channel 1 audio carries a completely mixed track with narration, 
music, actualities and effects.  Channel 2 audio has effects and 
actualities only.  

   To downlink this program, television stations should contact Joe 
Headlee, NASA Headquarters, 202/358-1734.  Stations are notified in 
advance when to expect a satellite feed with information on the 
current topics.

Audio

   NASA produces a weekly 4 1/2-minute program called the "The Space 
Story" and a 60-second spot called "Frontiers".  These topical radio 
programs feature astronauts, scientists and other people in NASA's 
ongoing research efforts.  These programs are distributed via 
satellite and on broadcast-quality cassettes to thousands of stations 
in the United States and abroad.

   Mission highlight audio tapes and other space-age sound effects 
also are available from NASA's radio office by calling 202/358-1735.

NASA Audio News Service

   Several NASA centers also provide up-to-date reports on 
aeronautics and space activities through automated telephone systems.  
The center codaphone services are:

      Dryden                   805/258-4464
      Goddard               301/286-NEWS (6397)
      Johnson                 713/483-8600
      Kennedy                 407/867-2525
      Marshall               205/544-NEWS (6397)
      Headquarters          202/358-3014

   Status reports during Space Shuttle missions are available by 
calling the above numbers for Kennedy (prelaunch), Johnson (mission 
operations) and Dryden (landing operations).  

Still Photography

   NASA field centers maintain photo files on current projects and 
those of the recent past.  Older files are periodically purged to 
make way for newer material.  The Broadcast and Imaging Branch, NASA 
Headquarters, has files covering projects and missions extending back 
to the agency's creation in 1958.  Researchers seeking early or 
general material may save time by starting their search at 
Headquarters.
