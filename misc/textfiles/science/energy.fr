Hmmmm.... seems like you all are interested in the topic. And
quite a topic it is as there is on-going work in the field that
obviously you won't read about in your newspaper. The following
file was written by a PhD Physicist who, due to the security
nature of his establishment, prefers to maintain his anonymity.

Abstract

A review is presented of the theory and experimental evidence relating 
to Zero Point Energy and Free Energy Devices.  This review is based on a 
two year study of the information and data available in these fields, 
and also upon the information presented by various key researchers in 
these fields at three recent conferences.  It is found that there is 
increasing momentum and a growing network of researchers taking place in 
these fields, despite reported efforts to suppress this information.  
Examples of such past and present suppression activities are included.  
Nevertheless, sound theoretical foundations for understanding so-called 
"Zero Point Energy" and "Free Energy" devices have been documented and 
are available.  There are several reports by various authors of 
experiments that indicate a much higher than normal operation 
efficiency, and even over-unity operation.  Unfortunately, these results 
have to date not been replicated by other researchers.  Since energy is 
conserved, pure perpetual motion cannot exist.  However, several 
examples are known to exist where energy efficiency can appear to be 
over-unity, and the motion can appear to us to be perpetual.  For these 
types of systems, the idea of "Free Energy" can be applied, and lessons 
learned.  Several experiments are discussed that have demonstrated the 
possibility of obtaining energy from space, and utilizing that energy in 
a way different from the normal laws of electricity.  These experiments 
and results are being tracked down and closely examined.  Valuable 
references with real mailing addresses and telephone numbers are 
included herein.  Replications of these encouraging results are 
desperately needed.

Introduction

"Let God kill him that does not know, yet presumes to show the other the 
way!"  This quote from a Persian dervish in the movie and videotape of 
"Meetings with Remarkable Men" by Gurdjieff (1963) pretty much 
summarizes my feelings toward the whole area of science, and living as 
well.  It's a jungle out there.  The dividing line between truth, 
fiction, what is best, and what sells has never been less clearly 
defined.  Since the advent of the digital information explosion, the sea 
of information has been growing at a pace that few can follow.  However, 
if we are to be responsible and seek the truth, we must persevere.  I am 
dedicated to finding the truth.  My fields of interest are Nature, 
religion, and science, and their beneficial applications to the human 
race.

To learn about the foundations and current technical knowledge in the 
Zero Point and Free Energy fields is to open a very large Pandora's Box.  
One finds non-believers, strong supporters, dissenters, and active hard-
nosed suppressers.  My interest was aroused as a teenager by reading 
about the life and contributions of Nikola Tesla, now available in the 
books by Walters (1961) and Cheney (1981).  He is the one individual 
responsible for creating the entire alternating current network that 
powers the world today.  He defied the science of his day, and designed 
and built the AC generator that transforms "potential" energy into 
"electrical" energy.  Yet, he is not in many school texts, and his basic 
theories and ideas for larger projects and applications were nearly lost 
to the world.  Why was he not supported?  Why is Thomas Edison such a 
well known name and Nikola Tesla is not?  Why was his research not 
actively continued?  Why does the academic community, within the US, 
continually ignore the possible applications of his theories?

Tesla was unceremoniously thrown out of the best technical school in 
Yugoslavia for believing that he could build a generator that would 
extract electrical power from a running stream of water.  His professor 
called it:  "Perpetual Motion!"  This is not so unfamiliar.  We have 
heard other such convenient explanations, such as:  "Heavier than air 
machines will never fly" (Lord Kelvin, 1890s);  "We threw out all of the 
textbooks, and then we built the airplane" (the Wright Brothers);  "The 
human body will not survive speeds of over 40 miles per hour" (early 
1900s);  and "Airplanes can not go faster than the speed of sound" 
(1940s).  Other example abound, all spoken by the out-spoken "leaders" 
of their day.  My view is that science continues to grow and mature.  
Nature is fixed.  Only our understanding of Nature continually unfolds.  
Sometimes this growth has been only painful, and sometimes it has 
provided great shocks to the system.  Fear of change is not an adequate 
excuse for not actively pursuing the development of our full 
capabilities as human beings, as individuals or as groups.

Areas Of Related Interest

The study of the "Free Energy" field overlaps with quite a number of 
other areas of science and technology that are not well understood, and 
are usually called "fringe areas."  I believe that responsible 
investigations in these areas do uncover important information and data 
that can relate to various questions that occur in the study of Free 
Energy.  These questions include:  Why is this research not conducted?  
Is it suppressed?  Why is it suppressed?  Are there other examples of 
such suppression?  Where can I get more information?  Are there any 
examples of such advanced related technologies?  If such energy sources 
exist, has anyone found out how to use them?  How do they work?  Can I 
use them, and can I use them in a responsible manner?

There is a great outcry by those familiar with our current energy policy 
and the public electricity utility network for need of a new 
breakthrough in the technology of energy production.  Dr. Gary Johnson 
(1992), a college professor and IEEE Senior Member, recently published a 
short review of the researchers in this area in a noted US technical 
journal and concluded his four page report with the statement:  

"There is a great deal of noise in the literature.  Some concepts are 
obviously nonsense.  Others will prove to be in error.  But is there any 
signal in all the noise?  There is if Tesla, Moray, and Bearden are 
correct.  The potential payoff is enormous, so the search should be 
continued if there is any chance at all of success."

Also, Llewellen King (1991), publisher of The Energy Daily, Defense 
Week, and Environmental Week Newsletters in Washington DC recently 
strongly and dramatically stated in a speech to an international 
technical conference:  

"We have failed with energy to come up with the 'Great Big 
Breakthrough!'  'The Major Change.'  'The Radically Different Thing.'  
'The Quantum Leap Forward.'  Where is the jump from a copper wire to a 
fiber or to a cable?  Where is the equivalent of fiber optics for 
electricity?  ... The new technologies (discussed at this conference), 
such as magnetohydrodynamics, (are advancing and coming forth), and yet 
these things have not fostered - and we are still boiling water!  It is 
theoretically possible that we could at some point take this 'Quantum 
Leap Forward.'  ... And in order to do that, I believe that you will 
need new institutions to deploy new technology.  They won't be deployed 
by the extant of the old institutions.  ... The Challenge in Technology 
is to find It, and then sell It, and finally to deploy It."

Since the status and results in energy technologies and in these other 
fringe areas are seen differently by different persons, many 
misunderstandings take place, people become frustrated, emotions become 
heated, and eventually someone gets sorely offended.  People can range 
from Apathy, to Denial, to Anger, and finally to Acceptance.  So as to 
not offend anyone in this paper, I will limit the areas of my summary 
introduction investigations to Politics, Religion, and Sex.

Politics

"Never give a sucker an even break."  I became very concerned when I 
became aware of first hand and second hand accounts of actual physical, 
emotional, and legal harassment being made to inventors, investigators, 
and writers in these scientific fringe areas.  And I thought all of 
these suppression stories were nonsense.  Upon investigation, harassment 
always follows those who promote a new paradigm.  Galileo spent a lot of 
time in jail.  So did Royal Rife, who demonstrated a cure for cancer in 
the 1930s, summarized in the books written by Barry Lyons (1989, 1989), 
published, of course, in Canada.  Christopher Bird (1991) writes of the 
persecution of Gaston Naessens for his radical and effective treatments 
of diseases.  America West Publishers has available many books that list 
actions that have been taken by various authorities to diffuse or bury 
"politically embarrassing" events and situations.  Paul Findley wrote a 
best seller (1985) that summarizes the effectiveness of large political 
pressure groups.  Fortunately today, there are many who do not conform 
to the "party line" in many political areas, such as the "Center for 
Action" in Nevada.  In the area of AIDS research and information 
transfer, Dr. Robert Strecker has produced a videotape (1988) and Dr. 
Taki Anagnoston (1991) has published a book that promotes a view far 
different than is advertised nationally to the American people.  "The 
Cutting Newsletter" by William Douglass also serves as a source for 
alternate information.

In my view, there is not a determined effort by the government to 
suppress information - because there is no government.  I see instead a 
collection and network of vested interest groups that seem to tightly 
band together for mutual financial survival.  The actions taken by any 
of these groups may be completely independent from the others.  
Therefore, I find the "government suppression" and "world domination" 
theories proposed by some to be interesting, and probably not 
applicable.  However, some sort of control and suppression in the press 
seems very evident.  Coleman (1992) has summarized that certain groups 
are actively controlling all other groups.  The "Project Censored 
Newsletter" and their student staff at Sonoma State University, CA, are 
actively pointing out US news stories that seem to be actively 
suppressed in this country.  So, how does this all relate to the topic 
of Free Energy?  Ken MacNeill (1983) published a very disturbing article 
entitled "Insights into the Proprietary Syndrome" in which he points out 
that over 3,000 patents have been suppressed!  It is reprinted in the 
Appendix of this paper.  READ IT!

Two historical events are worth including here regarding possible 
suppression and inability to commercialize Free Energy devices.  These 
are the Over-Unity Device of T. Henry Moray (Resines, 1988), and the 
Hindershot Motor (Brown, 1988).  Both of these devices were publicly 
demonstrated to the US press in the 1930s, and carefully conducted tests 
were made to assess these devices.  From the newspaper reports and 
clippings, it appears that both devices passed all tests, only to fall 
into oblivion.  What exactly happened to the devices, their inventors, 
and the technology is not known.  It also appears that the secrets of 
the devices died with their inventors.

If information deemed sensitive by certain governmental agencies can be 
actively suppressed, then what are the other possible ways of obtaining 
such information?  One method that has gained popularity in recent years 
is through the use of channeling.

Religion

"Ask and you shall receive".  I was surprised to hear that a grandmother 
("dharma") who said she could channel Nikola Tesla had been given a 
formal test in front of some very influential people in Los Angles, and 
she passed the test with very few errors.  I was told that the questions 
were prepared by a small knowledgeable group, and about half of the 
questions were reported to be trick questions.  Well, if this method can 
work to get advanced technical information let's try it.  After all, 
where do our ideas come from in the first place?  Both Tesla and Edison 
are reported to have made their respective amazing discoveries while 
daydreaming - not actually thinking!

Upon investigation, there is a morass of spiritual and channeled 
information being published out there.  From my point of view, it is all 
applicable to a person, depending upon where that person is at in his 
life, and of course it is not all true, applicable, or valid 
information.  The magazine "Connecting Link" summarizes a lot of this 
information.  Just for purposes of reference, I will list the names of 
those channeled intelligences that I have researched, by either reading 
their communications or personally conversing with them through their 
physical host.  (The references are organized by the name of the 
intelligence, or collective intelligence, with the name of the host or 
channeler in parentheses.)  From what I currently know, I give this list 
is given in order of increasing importance to me for personal 
information transfer:  

Ramtha, Lazaris, Seth, Bashar, Korton, Ashtar, Soltec, Cosmic Awareness, 
The Pleiadians, Hatonn, Ra, Hilarion, St. Germain, Thoth, Mary, Sananda, 
Aton.

To me, any information is valid only when it constructively supports or 
fits into the puzzle that I am trying to solve.  What is valid for each 
person varies with each person, and their puzzle of the moment.  I have 
noticed that I receive more valid information from hosts who are in 
unconscious trance during the communications.  If the host can remember 
anything of the communication, I feel there is always the possibility of 
tampering with the information during reception and transmission, thus 
producing "tainted" information.  This has historically occurred with 
many popularized channelers that have elected to use their talents and 
such communications primarily for their personal profit.  

Also, I find one needs to separate the substance of the message from any 
given dates.  To hear an intelligence say that "at this time a truck is 
gathering speed and is coming this way that will cross this intersection 
here in three hours," does not necessarily mean the truck will ever get 
there.  If it does, great.  Then that is a measure of predictability.  
If not, so what!  Was that the point?  Neither of these issues is 
demonstrable science.  I find it is best to gather the substance of the 
information and relate it to my puzzles.  Those that believe and act on 
all of the details of every channeled communication may be in for quite 
a shock, as described in the book When Prophecy Fails by Festinger, 
Riecken, and Schachter (1956).

I do know that some of the channeled information recently received is 
extremely accurate.  A case in point is the book channeled by Sananda 
through "dharma" (1989) regarding the life of Jesus .   While persons 
affiliated with America West Publishers, then in southern California, 
were trying to decipher the German text of the first few chapters of 
this material (originally translated into German from the Aramaic script 
found in 1963) with very little success, a complete translation in 
English was given in 1989 through "dharma" by Sananda (1989).  Two years 
later, the original German manuscript was translated by J. H. Ziegler 
and B. L. Greene, authored by Rashid (1992), and published by Wild 
Flower Press in Oregon.  Neither party knew of the existence of the 
other until after the material was typeset.  The contents are nearly 
identical.  I can personally attest to other cases of receiving 
extremely accurate information and being allowed to be involved in 
"unexplainable" physical events.

Whether one needs to be out-of-body to receive information, I am not 
sure.  Robert Monroe (1971, 1985) has spent years in this field with the 
Monroe Institute in Virginia, and he and his co-workers have all 
received personal knowledge.  I do not know if they have received any 
higher technical knowledge that is of interest here.  J. J. Hurtak 
(1978) received a vast amount of technical knowledge out-of-body when he 
channeled the extensive work The Keys of Enoch.

Why haven't these intelligences just given us the secrets of advanced 
technology on a silver platter?  I don't know.  Perhaps we as a 
collective society are not ready for it.  Some technical information is 
being given out from these intelligences and is slowly being published.  
Perhaps, as Hatonn, The Pleiadians, and other intelligences have 
suggested:  that if we told you that, then "they" would kill our 
vehicle.  Perhaps, waiting is.

Perhaps the goal of life is not to pursue the engineering of an easier 
life style solely for the comfort of living our lives through 
technology, but to finally realize what our personal mission here is, to 
become in touch with that mission, and then to perform that mission.  
That phrase from college:  "God has a plan for my life" makes very good 
sense here.  The problem actually may be that most of us are not taking 
the time to find out what our personal mission is, and how to 
responsibly perform it.  If you wish to pursue this, the most Holy 
course, I highly recommend the books by Dion Fortune (1957), Gaetan 
Delaforge (1987), and Fred and Pam Cameron (1991).  The latter book, 
Bridges of Light, includes step-by-step instructions, all specifically 
channeled, on how you can receive your own accurate information.  So Be 
It.

Sex

"It takes two to Tango."  Potentially, things are very interesting.  It 
seems to take two at different potentials to make something happen:  
male/female, up/down, positive/negative, north/south.  The view being 
taught today is primarily simply given in one or two dimensions.  
Electricity is caused by the electrons going one way on a wire, and the 
holes going the other way.  Electrical energy is created by chemical 
reactions that have a lower chemical ground state than the reactants.  
Chemical reactions are caused by electron bonding where electron orbits 
are finally filled and then higher orbits can be filled.  Atomic energy 
is caused by electrons and nucleons dropping into lower energy states 
(gamma rays and lasers), or by differences in the binding energy of the 
nuclei (fission and fusion).  The Sun gives and the Earth receives.

For energy creation, we have developed the catch-all term:  potential 
energy.  The water behind a dam is said to have a great deal of 
potential energy, so the electricity is said to come out of the power 
plant.  A battery has a stored electrical potential, so it powers your 
radio.  Men and women all have stored potential, and we all know what 
trouble that can cause.  However;  no one ever talks about magnets, and 
the possible potential energies within magnets and electromagnetic 
fields.  Light is such an electromagnetic (EM) field.  The motions of 
the electrical component and the magnetic component of alternating 
current, similar to light, are three-dimensional as they travel along a 
wire, and at several points, each is zero.  Where did they go?  How is 
EM energy stored and transmitted?  Can usable amounts of energy be 
extracted from already existing large and massive EM fields?

I have found only two sources that reference the modeling of EM fields 
in three spatial dimensions:  the works of Walter Russell (1926, 1947, 
1989), and material channeled by Hatonn et. al. (1991).  The idea that 
energy exists in male and female vortices that form between this 
dimension and other dimensions is not new.  The idea just hasn't been 
very useful, yet.  Russell and Hatonn describe three dimensional 
elemental EM fields that can be classified as male and female by the 
spin of their 3-D EM fields, much the same way that we describe the 
poles of a bar magnet.  Russell developed and tested counter-wound sets 
of coils, each in the shape of overlapping (male/female) cones.  Such a 
coupling and cancellation of these fields would open up a whole new way 
of thinking about electricity and EM fields in general.  Also, a new 
investigation of the physics of rotating permanent magnets and rotating 
EM fields would be very interesting.  All reported research in these 
fields seems to stop in the early 1950s.  I wonder why.

UFOs and Crop Circles

"We are living in Lies."  This statement was made by both Colin Andrews 
and Linda Moulton-Howe during their presentations during the Whole Life 
Expo (WLE) in San Francisco, April 1991.  It speaks for itself.  If 
examples of advanced technology are being demonstrated all around us 
nearly every day, shouldn't we be interested?  Well, if it does not 
impact our daily life, and our personal finances, maybe we don't care.  
We could say, let the government figure it out.  Well, evidently, "they" 
don't, can't, or won't care.  Besides, what you don't know won't hurt 
you.  Right?  However;  it may stunt your growth.

If you really want to know, you are going to have to rely on yourself.  
This is all very interesting to me, because it allows for the 
possibility of several examples of advanced technology here and now.  
And from my experiences, these phenomena are real, reoccurring, and 
getting more numerous and in-your-face outrageous all the time.

Without diverting from our main topic for too long, I will list the best 
sources of UFO craft pictures and crop geometrical formation material I 
have found.  (They are not just dots in the sky, and circles,  any more.  
Sorry.)  The UFO craft pictures began in the 1950s with those taken by 
George Adamski and published in his book in by Leslie in 1953.  (These 
pictures could have been faked, and I recall someone telling me that 
Adamski was said to have declared his whole photograph library a fraud 
on his death bed;  and I do not know.)  The pictures taken and thousands 
of sightings reported in the New York Hudson Valley region in the 1980s 
cannot be denied (Hynek, 1987).  Pictures from around the world have 
been compiled in two books by Wendelle Stevens and August Roberts 
(1985).  Other UFO book sources are listed.  And, the UFO Video 
Clearinghouse in California has just about all the movie footage and 
video taken of UFOs and TV programs produced that are available world-
wide.  "UFO's the Best Evidence" is a two-hour video produced by KLAS, 
Channel 6 in Las Vegas, that should be seen by everyone!

Close-up photographs, movie footage, and videotapes are much more 
disturbing to some people than the usual lights in the sky.  The 
photographs by Billy Meier in Volume 1 of the books by Elders (1979) are 
apparently all actual photographs of large disk craft.  (I was told that 
a few of the pictures in Volume 2 (1983) were of models that were made 
in order to compare to Meier's craft photographs, and then the photos 
were inadvertently mixed).  For those that disagree with this, I 
recommend that you carefully read the technical photographic analyses in 
Volume 1 that were performed on some of the photos by disinterested 
scientists in the US using electron microscopes, laser scanning, and 
computer analyses and enhancements;  and then read the book by Gary 
Kinder (1987), who set out to visit Meier, his family, and the people in 
the local community there in Switzerland in order to prove the Meier 
story a hoax.  Also, we have the pictures from Gulf Breeze, Florida, in 
the book by Ed and Francis Walters (1990).  (Some say they faked the 
pictures, but not to the hundreds of local eye witnesses that claimed to 
have seen the same thing, including most of the city officials.)

Robert (Bob) Lazar presents an interesting story in his videotape (1992) 
of how he became involved with some disk craft while working in the 
power propulsion area.  His story is summarized as one of the six 
viewpoints in the book by Lindemann (1991), as is Linda Moulton-Howe's.  
Lazar states that the craft he worked on were powered by a matter-
antimatter (potential energy) reaction with a near-stable element of an 
atomic number of 115, which has not yet been found or produced on Earth.  
Such a nuclide could give off power in a manner similar to Cobalt-60, 
which emits very high energy and deadly gamma radiation, thus the need 
for lead shielding in nuclear fission power plants.  How the El-115 
power would be utilized is unknown.  More to the point, how would such 
craft be able to levitate above the Earth?  Perhaps it could utilize an 
interaction of engineered variable frequency EM fields with the Earth's 
local gravity and EM fields.  That could explain the very complex and 
time-dependent harmonics found by expert sound researchers when they 
analyzed the sound of a hovering craft as recorded on audio tape by 
Meier while making movies of a craft.  These are all available.

For additional information regarding what these craft are, who are 
coming, and why, I would recommend the material from Stanton Friedman 
(1991) and Sananda (1989).  Additional viewpoints are found in the book 
by Lindemann (1991) and in the transcription of the wonderful talk given 
by Linda Moulton-Howe at the April 1991 SF WLE.  It appears we are being 
visited by more than 50 alien cultures on the physical plane, all 
different, yet related, each having their own version of their "sports 
car or RV," and each with their own purposes and motivations.  It also 
appears that this is nothing new, has been going on for what appears to 
be a very, very long time, and so what!  What is interesting is the 
apparent lack of advanced technology transfer, which could be likened to 
a possible violation of the "Prime Non-Interference Directive" 
popularized in Star Trek.  Unless such advanced data is being given to 
the privileged few.  Unless we, in the US and in other parts of the 
world, as individual societies are being allowed the information as fast 
as we can (financially) safely absorb it and properly utilize it for our 
benefit and not our mutual destruction.  That is what I would hope.  
That is where I want to be.

The crop formations are another and perhaps a more advanced topic 
altogether.  The books by Colin Andrews (1989), Alick Bartholomew 
(1991), and Ralph Noyes (1990) stimulate the imagination.  As Colin 
would say:  "I'm sorry.  It just isn't Doug and Dave, as the British 
Press would have you believe!"  These formations have become quite 
complex, such as the Barbury Castle formation that appeared overnight in 
July 1991.  It contains three "circles" of about 35 feet in diameter 
located at the apex of a nearly equilateral triangle that measures about 
180 feet on a side, with three internal circles and spokes within the 
triangle.  I highly recommend Colin Andrew's (1991) videotape 
"Undeniable Evidence."

Background Material

It is important that I include as much quality reference material as I 
am able.  These areas of interest have grown so large and confusing that 
it is difficult to know where to turn for the best or most meaningful 
information.  So I will include a list of the most applicable patents, 
the best books, reports, conference proceedings, and the most up-to-date 
papers that I know of in the Zero Point Energy and Free Energy fields.  
I also have included in the references the complete names and addresses 
of several technical societies, groups, and book sources.

Patents

There are several patents of phenomena and devices that are of interest.  
Rather than discuss them here, I will list them in the references.  They 
may be referred to later.

It is important to note that you can quickly obtain any patent from a 
local US patent clearinghouse, such as the one in Sunnyvale, California, 
by a telephone call or a FAX once an account has been set up for you.  
If you are not in a hurry, you can order a copy of any patent for $3.00 
(three dollars) each from the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks in 
Washington DC, although it may take 2-6 weeks.  Just provide the long 
patent number.

Books and Reports

Many books and reports have been published that relate to the Free 
Energy fields.  I have listed the ones I have looked at in the 
references in this section.  I have included all of Lt. Col. Tom 
Bearden's books and reports.  It should be pointed out that Tom's book 
entitled AIDS:  Biological Warfare (1988) probably has the best 
description of the pumped phase conjugate mirror wave theory model of 
any of his books.  The book by Moray B. King (1989) gives an excellent 
overview of the definition of Zero Point Energy.  Several books and 
reports have recently emerged regarding gravity and the Earth's apparent 
energy grid network.  Books regarding the Orgonne Accumulator and ether 
vortex mechanics are also included.  The book by Hans Nieper (1981) is a 
great reference book, and sometimes hard to find:  use the source 
listed.  The theories promoted by Richard Hoagland and the Mars Mission 
are also interesting, including the fact that a solid tetrahedron placed 
in a sphere will intersect the sphere at 19.5 degrees latitude, which is 
the same Earth latitude upon which Tesla was constructing his 
Wardenclyffe Tower in New York.  The theories of Victor Schauberger 
(Alexandersson, 1982) are also very interesting, including his 
descriptions of Natural energy vortices, the changing properties of 4 
degree C water with the phases of the moon, as descriptions of other 
Natural wonders.  

Conferences

I am familiar with only a few of the many technical conferences held 
that deal with the Zero Point and Free Energy fields.  The one's I have 
recently attended are the 26th Intersociety Energy Conversion 
Engineering Conference (IECEC), held in August 1991 in Boston, MA;  the 
1992 International Tesla Symposium, held in July 1992 in Colorado 
Springs, CO;  and the 27th IECEC held in August 1992 in San Diego, CA.  
As I organized the authors and papers for both the 26th and 27th IECECs 
in the "Innovative Concepts" sessions for the "New Technologies for 
Energy Utilization Area," I am more familiar with their papers and 
contents.  The material presented in other conferences, such as the bi-
annual International Tesla Society conferences, do relate and overlap 
with much of the material presented in the recent IECEC conferences.  It 
is my desire that future authors will network and exchange information 
before they write their next paper, so we can accelerate and converge 
the work that is being performed in these fields.

Free Energy Theory, Experiments,  and Devices

"Come on, let me show you where it's at."  Well, I can show you what I 
have been able to find out from the referenced sources within the past 
three years anyway.  I have learned that there is a lot of very sound 
scientific theory that supports the existence of additional energy 
sources, ways of interacting with those potential energies, and 
extracting energy for use.  There is also a lot of experiments, devices, 
and just good ol' fooling around going across the country to try to 
measure new ways of measuring these new energy sources.  There are also 
devices that have been built, tested, demonstrated, and provided for 
testing by others - that seem to have passed all of the tests.  These 
will be discussed below.  First some truths and definitions.

Energy exists.  It can not be created nor destroyed.  Energy can only be 
converted from one form into another.  In that conversion process, some 
energy is lost, in the form of friction or heat, so the efficiency of 
the energy transfer process is always less than 100 percent.  The 
process (you can envision a box) will always give less energy out than 
energy goes in.  The ratio of "energy out" to "energy in" is always less 
than one:  under-unity.  An over-unity device cannot exist.  Perpetual 
motion does not exist.  All motion eventually will run down.  (Whether 
you live to be here when it does run down is another matter.)  So, let's 
see.  A car battery is a good example.  It has so much energy to start 
with, and it eventually runs down from starting the starter motor and 
friction in the wire.  Draw a larger box.  The car runs and recharges 
the battery because the engine converts the potential energy within the 
fuel during combustion into crankshaft motion, which is then used to 
recharge the battery, until it runs out of gas.  Draw a larger box.  The 
car can go downhill with the engine off by transforming the potential 
energy of the hill into kinetic or moving energy at the bottom of the 
hill.  OK.  But what about Hoover Dam?  It just sits there and creates 
energy.  We don't put any energy into it, except when we built it.  And 
we sure didn't put as much energy into it as we have gotten out of it.  
And it for sure is not going to last forever.  But it's doing just fine 
now.  So is that an example of a Free Energy device with an energy 
conversion factor of over-unity?  Yes or No?

To handle such mind benders, workers in the Zero Point and Free Energy 
fields have, for better or worse, and probably for the near term worse, 
have adopted a simple way of describing the results of their research, 
in terms of what they can immediately measure and see.  So there are 
three categories that are generally expounded upon:  "Free Energy Under-
unity," "Free Energy, Over-unity," and "Zero Point Energy."  (1) "Free 
Energy Under-unity" would be when I get more energy out than before and 
I only made a small change to my design, like to increase the overall 
system efficiency.  An example might be those magnets that when placed 
onto a car gas line give 5 miles extra per gallon.  That's Free Energy 
dude!  This appears to be the case for several motors and generators 
that utilize magnets on their rotating shafts.  (2)  "Free Energy Over-
unity" would be where I seem to get more energy out than I know am 
putting in.  Period.  An example would be pushing a car over the top of 
a hill.  When it takes off without you, it appears additional energy is 
coming from somewhere.  And, in all cases, of such experiments, the 
energy MUST be coming from somewhere in some form.  It just hasn't been 
figured out yet, and the researcher has probably not drawn a large 
enough box.  (3)  "Zero Point Energy" refers to the energy that comes 
from outside your influence:  the wiring in the wall;  the transmission 
lines nearby;  a large EM signal on a specific FM radio station;  the 
Earth's EM or gravitational field;  solar EM energy;  or possibly 
directed energy from outer space.  Just because we can't measure it, 
doesn't mean it's not there.

With these definitions in mind, we see that Hoover Dam is a good example 
and could be considered by some Dam Engineer to be an over-unity device.  
A good Dam Scientist would probably point out that the Sun evaporates 
the oceans and lakes, moves the vapor, makes the rain that fills the 
Dam, and the potential energy of the water produces the electrical 
power.  The Dam Engineer could probably care less, and could also say 
that the Dam is a perpetual motion machine that will last forever;  
which means at least until he retires and his kids are out of college.  
The Dam Engineer would say:  "The Dam thing runs on Free Energy out of 
the air!  The city of Los Angles believes it!"  But:  you know it won't 
last forever.  Neither will the Sun.

So we need to be careful in our choice of words.  For the purposes of 
this paper, a Free Energy device will appear to produce more energy than 
it uses, because it is not known from what form of potential energy 
source the other required input energy comes from.  Thus, we will allow 
system efficiencies over 100%, and over-unity energy conversion until we 
are either proven wrong, or we finally draw a larger box and understand 
what is happening inside that box.

It is very important here to be a Fair Witness.  (Thank you Robert 
Heinlein!)  That is a person who reports exactly what he or she sees;  
no more, no less.  Researchers and investors really do not give a (guess 
what) about what you think is going on.  They want the facts of exactly 
what you observed.  If a device appears to be promising:  say so, and 
report it to be so.  If it has a problem, say it seems to have a 
problem.  Only after extensive support, testing, and cross-examination 
should an experiment or a device be classified or labeled a fraud or a 
failure.  Once labeled as such, they will not easily obtain further 
support.  Be responsible.

Free Energy Theoretical Considerations

Harold Aspden from the United Kingdom (1991) shared insights into the 
basic factors involved with vacuum field or zero point energy so that:  
"the 'free energy' challenge to win through and revolutionize the energy 
scene can involve more people with design skills and resources."  He 
proposes a frontal attack on currently accepted physics, urging:  "a 
theoretical and experimental program to follow projects in five 
classifications:  (1) Non-relativistic energy theory;  (2) Ferromagnetic 
vacuum energy generation;  (3) Electrodynamic vacuum energy generation;  
(4) Electromagnetic vacuum energy generation;  and (5) Gravitational 
vacuum energy generation."  He also pointed out the need for much of the 
work to be proprietary in order to attract investment funds,  but 
eventually the published literature would be augmented by disclosure 
arising by development on these projects.  Aspden (1992) this year 
described a foundation of a new technology for converting environmental 
heat energy into electricity.  The structure involved, whether in the 
tested thermoelectric device or the suggested radiation concentration 
device, uses thin film metal films separated by non-conductive 
materials.  An efficiency of 70% of the Carnot maximum has been 
demonstrated for the thermoelectric device operating at ambient 
temperatures with a 20 degree temperature differential.

Moray B. King (1992) presents a very good detailed review of the 
"Progress and Results in Zero-Point Energy Research" in his paper with 
the same title, available from Tesla Inc.  Moray states:

"Since the advent of quantum mechanics, modern physics has supported the 
view that the fabric of totality of empty space is not void but contains 
a plenum of energy called the zero point energy (ZPE).  The energy 
consists of fluctuations of electric field energy that persists even at 
zero degrees Kelvin.  A question applicable to engineers is can the ZPE 
be tapped as an energy source?  At first this idea seems to be a blatant 
violation of conservation of energy, but if the zero-point energy really 
exists as is suggested by modern physics, energy is present and its 
conversion would not be the issue."

"The surprising cold current effect has been associated with other 
inventions, such as T. Henry Moray's, using number 30 wire within his 50 
kiloWatt device.  It might be explained by the hypothesis that the 
coupling of synchronous ion oscillations with the ZPE can manifest 
macroscopic vacuum polarization displacement currents, which can 
surround a conductive wire and be guided by it.  Conduction band 
electrons, lacking stable, radially convergent vacuum polarization 
lines, have a minimal interaction with these displacement currents, and 
the wires remain cold.  If engineers could replicate this effect, zero-
point energy research would receive widespread interest."

"Another area where coherent ion motion is associated with energy 
anomalies involves abrupt electrical discharges.  (This is apparent in 
controlled water explosion experiments.)  Hyde's device was faced with a 
similar problem of absorbing large voltage pulses in his patented 
invention.  He solved the problem and created an advanced embodiment 
which produced over 20 kiloWatts of net output power while free 
running."

"From the concentrated vacuum polarization of atomic nuclei arises the 
possibility of triggering a macroscopic ZPE coherence with the 
synchronous motion of many nuclei.  Further supporting evidence arises 
from inventions that utilize coherent ion motions and output excessive 
energy.  The sharp voltage spikes that arise from ion-acoustic activity 
can be converted by use of circuits such as Hyde's voltage divider.  The 
largest effects might be produced by solid state methods that manifest 
dual, counter-rotating, acoustical, lattice spinor waves.  If 
synchronous ion-acoustic activity coheres the zero-point energy, there 
will be many more inventions forthcoming, and a new energy source will 
be recognized."

It should be pointed out that the voltage divider circuit in Hyde's 
patent (patent Fig. 6) has been questioned by several engineers.  Moray 
King is assisting a network of scientists and engineers who are 
redesigning this circuit to replicate and produce a working model of 
this device.

For some years, Tom Bearden (1991) has worked on an extended 
electromagnetics theory, involving the scalar component of the 
quaternion.  (A scalar is a number with no vector direction, like speed.  
A vector has numerical values in each defined direction, like velocity.  
A quaternion is like a 4-component vector in a real-complex plane 
space).  In MAXWELL'S ORIGINAL QUATERNION THEORY, this scalar component 
often remains when the directional components zero.  Further, it enfolds 
vectors and functions of vectors inside, in a hidden variable manner.  
Specifically, Tom has patterned a unified field theory concept upon the 
previously unnoticed but remarkable early work of E. T. Whittaker.  "In 
1903 and 1904, Whittaker showed that all present day vector EM can be 
replaced by scalar potential interferometry, and that bidirectional 
harmonic EM plane wave sets could be used to produce a standing wave of 
force-field-free potential.  In modern terms, this shows how to turn EM 
wave energy into electrogravitional potential energy, then how to 
interfere two such scalar potentials to recover the EM energy, even at a 
distance.  This unrecognized work is of great importance:  when applied 
to modern physics, it produces supersets of quantum mechanics, classical 
electromagnetics, and general relativity.  Further, all three extended 
disciplines unify on their common Whittaker subset, in a testable and 
engineerable fashion."  All of Tom's theories to unify electromagnetics, 
general relativity, and quantum mechanics are summarized in his 1991 
paper, which is only six pages long!  These are all available from the 
Association of Distinguished American Scientists.

Bearden (1992) this year points out that:  "By utilizing fundamental new 
definitions for energy, potential, and scalar potential, the mass of the 
atomic nucleus may be considered a powerful electrostatic scalar 
potential, referred to as the mass potential.  The Whittaker EM biwave 
structure of the scalar potential then becomes a new and universal 
internal EM structure for mass, including the atomic nucleus.  This 
structure can be directly manipulated electromagnetically, which allows 
direct EM alternation of the mass potential, and the nucleus itself.  
This totally new class of nuclear interactions is briefly explored, and 
several hypothesized mechanisms advanced for neutralizing or processing 
nuclear wastes.  Additional applications are hypothesized for 
experimental falsification or verification.  We have previously pointed 
out two successful experiments by Sweet, one for extracting useful EM 
energy from the vacuum, and one for the production of unilateral forces, 
including antigravity.  We have also pointed out the implications of the 
approach for possible testable unification of electromagnetics, general 
relativity, and quantum mechanics.  The cited Whittaker theory 
establishes a greatly expanded but engineerable EM, with external 
(spatial) and internal (hyperspatial) subsets.  Scientists and engineers 
are urged to seriously study the two cited Whittaker papers and their 
implications, and to set up experiments to falsify or verify the 
hypotheses advanced."

A new paradigm and a theoretical analysis supporting experimental tests 
of the N-Machine was given by Shiuji Inomata from Japan (1991).  He 
points out that H. A. Lorentz's treatment, in which a stationary ether 
is assumed, gives the correct answer.  Even in this case, a new paradigm 
of science is necessary for the full understanding of the functioning N-
Machine.

Kurt Van Voorhies (1991) is conducting his graduate work at a well known 
state university in the prospects of world-wide wireless power transfer, 
as first proposed by Tesla.  Tesla had designed and was building the 
Wardenclyffe tower on Long Island in 1900, featuring a 187 foot wooden 
tower designed to support a 68 foot diameter copper hemisphere.  While 
Tesla intended to use the facility publicly for communications, his 
secret aim was to implement wireless power transmission.  The 
transmitter was to have operated at 30-100 megaVolts, which Tesla 
claimed was sufficient for worldwide power distribution.  However, when 
Marconi demonstrated transoceanic wireless communications with much 
simpler equipment (illegally using Tesla's patents in the process), J. 
P. Morgan withdrew funding for Tesla's project.  Research indicates that 
the power receiver requires the most development to demonstrate Tesla's 
early theories.

Toby Grotz (1991) also presented theory and results of Project Tesla to 
determine if the Earth's electrostatic (atmospheric) Schumann Cavity can 
be resonated, if the power that is delivered to the cavity propagates 
with very low losses, and if power can be extracted at other locations 
within the cavity.  The theory, bases of operation of a transmitter, 
related computer programs, and component values are all given in Toby's 
paper.

A theoretical analysis of Tesla's "Death Ray" was also presented by Toby 
Grotz (1991).  By carefully examining historical records, this 1937 
design was probably the first attempt to construct a high voltage 
particle beam device.  Tesla's estimates indicate that a 5 meter 
diameter metal sphere charged to 60 million volts could project a high 
energy charged particle beam up to 60 kilometers through the air in a 
given direction.

Oliver Nichelson (1991) summarized two of Tesla's later energy 
generation device designs, including a turbine-shaped Unipolar Dynamo 
design for a machine that can continue to produce electricity after 
being disconnected from an outside power source.  This paper is also 
important because it also describes Tesla's "Coil for Electro-
Magnetics," patented in 1893.  This coil looks exactly the same as would 
the counter-wound conical coils of Walter Russell, if Russell's coils 
were drawn on a piece of paper in two dimensions.  (Surprise.)

Don Kelly (1991) examined the theory and operation of an enhanced tank 
circuit from two dated Soviet papers translated from the Russian.  The 
experiments suggest that the full band of a tank circuit can be utilized 
to take advantage of a full EMF output over an extended period of time, 
and then periodically and uniformly re-exciting the circuit as an 
effective electrical energy conservation method.  Don suggests that 
over-unity operation may be possible by proper adjustment of the 
resonant driver frequency and time-varying component reactances.

Paul LaViolette (1991) suggested taking a more lenient interpretation of 
the First Law of Thermodynamics and allowing the possibility that free 
energy devices could operate at efficiencies exceeding 100%.  He 
evaluates several ways of generating free energy in the context of 
subquantum kinetics gene energy (photon blueshifting), zero-point 
fluctuations, Ampere law forces, and electrogravitic gravity field 
manipulations.

Lynn Surgalla (1991) presented a tutorial on non-linear resonance 
phenomena which describes the mathematical theoretical techniques she 
feels necessary for modeling the design, tuning, and control of 
nonlinear effects.

Jose Zoleta from the Philippines (1991) proposed his TAF-13 device:  
Triac Alternator Flywheel Motor, as an alternate source of energy.  By 
carefully choosing the components and resonant frequency of operation, 
he expects to produce 150% or more energy than input into his motor-
generator system.  However, I feel that more details and data on his 
design are necessary to expect his system to provide over-unity 
operation.

In discussing plans for the quad-disc electrostatic generator, Donald 
Kelly (1992), described the basic principles of the Wimshurst twin 
counterrotating electrostatic (E/S) disks, and in addition a twin rotor-
to-stator E/S generating factor is included in this composite generator.  
The positive and negative stator discs on each side of the rotor disc 
receive E/S transfer from the multiple conductive segments on the outer 
side of each rotor.  The voltage and current amplification functions 
would be accomplished by twin, large capacitive transformers, similar to 
those used in the Swiss M-L converter, discussed in the next section 
below.

An improved method of winding inductors, transformers, and motors was 
publicized by Toby Grotz (1992).  This invention greatly enhances the 
ability to generate magnetic fields with a given amount of wire.  This 
invention may be as fundamental to the use of magnetic fields as was 
Nikola Tesla's use of rotating magnetic fields for the generation of 
alternating current. 

George Hathaway in Canada (1991, 1992) has suggested the engineering 
requirements necessary to begin to investigate and demonstrate zero 
point energy.  He draws together the most practical theoretical aspects 
of this work, and explains how they are already at a sufficiently 
advanced stage to allow initial experiments to be designed.  He states 
that the extraction of energy from such sources is really not an ivory 
tower pipe dream, but more a matter of nuts and bolts.  Thus, his 
suggestions should serve as a sound basis for those engineers and 
researchers to keep a close watch on vacuum energy physics.

The Integrity Institute is interested in providing the new measurement 
devices and instrumentation that will be needed to conduct meaningful 
experiments in these new advanced energy machine areas.  Tom Valone 
(1991) presented an overview of the interests of the Institute, and the 
various technical areas they have supported and hope to support in the 
future.

Finally, in the important related area of theoretical financing, 
Professor Charles Berg (1991) pointed out the relationship between 
available investment capital in the current conventional energy resource 
and conservation areas, and possible funding in these new innovative 
technologies.  He points out that:  "an innovative concept, as initially 
applied, usually results in only a small rise in productivity.  However, 
immediately afterward, there follows a wave of rapid improvement in the 
implementation of the new concept.  This wave is responsible for almost 
all the improvements in productivity that the innovation brings to 
society.  Still;  without the introduction of the innovative concept, 
there would be nothing upon which to improve."  To me, his message to 
investors is:  plan on very little return in the short term, and through 
licensing and networking agreements, reap a harvest that benefits all 
the World in the near term and thereafter.

Reports on Experiments and Working Devices

John and Kevin Moray (1956, 1991) were kind to allow publication of a 
portion of their book The Sea of Energy:  the history of T. Henry Moray 
and his devices, who from the early 1900s to the 1930s demonstrated to 
the US press's satisfaction massive over-unity energy conversion.

"In 1901, T. Henry Moray theorized that energy was coming from within 
the earth.  Through continuous experimentation and in spite of the 
doubts held by the scientific community of the day, he discovered that 
the energy was not coming from the ground but from an outside source 
away from the earth.  The energy came in continuous surges, like waves 
of the sea, more in the daytime than at night.  At this time Moray had 
enough power to light a 16-candle power carbon lamp at about one-half 
capacity.  He labeled and defined his "Radiant Energy:  The source of 
energy coming from the cosmos to the earth and radiating back from 
whence it came."

"Upon completion of his first Radiant Energy Device, many tests and 
experiments were conducted for the scientific and public communities.  
Channeling the waves of energy was done by way of an antenna.  When set 
up and connected to the ground, priming and then tuning, the device 
would draw electrical energy.  Results of this experimentation proved 
that the power generation had not originated from within the device.  
The device, through channeling radiant energy, produced up to 50,000 
Watts of power and worked for long periods of time.  For political 
reasons many people, organizations, and agencies of the day opposed him 
strongly.  Despite the deliberate destruction of the R. E. Device, 
threats against his work and his family, and armed attacks by unknown 
assailants, T. Henry Moray continued with his dream of harnessing a 
usable energy that the world could benefit from, and the same time save 
the earth from the many methods of energy retrieval which now scar and 
pollute its land, air, and seas."  

(As a side note, Moray's first germanium solid-state device 
(semiconductor) was submitted to the U. S. Patent Office in 1927, and 
was rejected on the basis that it would not work without a heated 
cathode.)  (Boy.  Am I glad times have changed.  Whew!)  (That's a sick 
joke folks!)  Wake Up!

A complete description of operational electrostatic motors is given in 
the book by Oleg Jefimenko (1973).  Some small electrostatic motors can 
be operated using only Earth-field antennas.

Paul Brown (1992) describes recent developments in materials technology 
that now make it possible to fabricate nonthermal thin-film isotopic 
energy converters with a specific power of 24 kiloWatts/kilogram and 5 
to 10 years working life at 5 to 10 Watts.  He states:  "This creates 
applications never before possible, such as placing the power supply 
directly on integrated circuit chips.  The efficiency of the converters 
is about 25%, which is two to three times greater than the 6 to 8% 
capabilities of current thermoelectric systems."

In a very impressive and I feel extremely important paper, Paul Brown 
(1991) described his ability to place radioactive nuclear isotope 
material into a resonant tank circuit and extract energy from the 
decaying nuclide.  He writes:  "A phenomena known as the 'Beta Voltaic 
Effect' is used to directly convert radioactive decay energy into 
electricity without going through a thermal cycle.  A great attraction 
of isotopic power sources is that radioactive decay energy is several 
orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy."  Specifically Paul 
uses a strong beta-emitting nuclide, like Krypton-85 or Strontium-90 as 
the radioactive material and places it directly into a tunable LC tank 
circuit.  He claims that results of 50% conversion efficiencies have 
been demonstrated, and greater efficiencies are hoped for in the future.  
I have heard that T. Henry Moray had used radioactive substances in his 
device in the 1930s.  I wonder if charged particles or charged ions play 
an important role in these effects.  Moray King (1992) thinks they do. 

Recent research has been conducted by Toby Grotz, Tim Binder, and Ron 
Kovac (1992) in order to verify Walter Russell's theories and 
experiments.  They write:  "The experiments that Russell conducted in 
1927, which were verified by Westinghouse laboratories, have been 
repeated.

Russell at that time thought that he had found a novel way to change the 
ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in a sealed quartz tube containing water 
vapor.    Russell's data indicated that, where there had only been water 
vapor consisting of hydrogen and oxygen in the tube, the addition of 
inert gasses in the amount of 69% were detected.  The use of magnetic 
fields was shown to produce this effect.  The end result of the 
experiment was to demonstrate a cheap and efficient method of hydrogen 
production for a hydrogen based fuel economy."  Russell also developed 
and tested counter-wound sets of coils, each in the shape of overlapping 
cones.  The device was based on the "power multiplication principle" 
discussed in the many books that he had written.  According to a memo 
dated in 1961, the device worked:  "because of the false concept of 
gravity which assumes it to be force of attraction which pulls inward 
from within instead of a cyclic force which controls the expansion of 
cold into heat, and the expansion of heat into cold... Nature's first 
principle of power production and the construction of matter is to 
produce heat from the cold of space.  The heat thus generated radiates 
back into cold to complete the wave cycle which automatically repeats 
itself in this ageless universe of infinite continuity."  (This is very 
similar to the theories of Victor Schauberger;  Alexandersson, 1982).  
On September 10, 1961, Walter and (his wife) Lao Russell reported to 
their contacts at NORAD, that the coils had worked and that the 
President of the United States could announce to the world that a 
"greater, safer power than atomic energy" could be provided for industry 
and transportation.  The Russell's were convinced that they had found 
and demonstrated a new source of energy and a conversion process for 
what is now known as the zero point energy.

Bill Muller has developed the Muller Motor/Generator and presented a 
very good review of the theoretical principles in his 1991 referenced 
paper.  His motors utilize super powerful permanent magnets with 
amorphous metal parts that have practically zero hysteresis losses!  
Utilizing their design, based upon an odd-even magnetic pole design 
developed in 1852, they describe the creation of a magnetic balance in 
the motor which eliminates the work required to remove one pole from the 
other no matter how large or how strong the magnetic surface would be.  
I liked how Bill talked about powerful permanent magnets:  "It is only 
because these super powerful magnets carry enormous ampere pressures 
within themselves that they are now able to lift their own weight."  
This supports my view that permanent magnets, including planets, are 
vast sources of potential energy.  The Muller's are very excited about 
the operational characteristics of their motors and generators, and 
demonstrated one large motor at the 26th IECEC in Boston, MA.  Their 
paper includes a detailed description of their circuits with voltage and 
current analyses.  They have obtained very high system efficiencies, and 
state that "Up to this point, there is no reason to expect what is 
called over-unity either on the motor or the generator."  Bill has 
promised to continue his experiments and keep in contact with interested 
parties.

The Reed (1991) Magnetic Motor is an electromechanical device that Troy 
Reed says runs on magnetic power.  The author has developed a small 
prototype and a larger unit that have both undergone several 
demonstrations and testing programs.  He has also filed for a Patent 
with the Patent Office and the Foreign PTO/EPO.  In his design, eight 
permanent magnets are placed on each of four disks.  Two outer disks 
remain stationary while the two inner ones are mounted on a common shaft 
and are allowed to turn freely.  Videotapes and other information are 
available.

The electrical dynamo patented by Barbara Hickox (1991) is an 
interesting device.  The design includes a central rotating non-
conductive cylinder into which small cylindrical permanent magnets are 
placed.  The interesting part is that the magnets are all positioned 
with one pole outward, and located on two spiral lines down the surface 
of the rotating cylinder.  Barbara claims that when properly designed, 
single-wound coils in the proximity of these rotating magnets will 
exhibit power transfers much higher than the power required to turn the 
cylinder.  Again, here is the idea of a spiral or cyclic texture within 
the substance of existing energy fields.

It must be pointed out here that accurate measurements of high frequency 
power can be difficult to make and results can be inferred that are very 
much in error (Triner & Hansen, NASA, 1977).  All measurements of input 
and output voltages and currents must be very carefully performed.

The Bedini free energy generator (1991) was also discussed.  Complete 
plans are given for the construction of a free energy system.  While not 
an over-unity device, the battery recharging circuit does allow a 
battery to operate for a much longer period of time than it normally 
would, thus giving the user that much more energy for free.  However, it 
was pointed out that certain circuit components, such as the transistor 
numbers, may be in error in these plans, and that a brand new battery 
must used.  Refer to Moray King's 1992 paper for more details.

Gary Johnson (1992) reported that electrically induced explosions in 
water exhibiting free energy are relatively easy to produce with a 2 
micro-farad capacitor charged to 10 kiloVolts.  "Expanding steam does 
not seem to be the main cause for the explosions.  Similar explosions 
are obtained with significantly different peak currents, which raises 
questions about the longitudinal Ampere forces being the primary cause.  
It is therefore conceivable that we are tapping a new energy source."  
(Of course, this technique may not be the optimum one to extract this 
energy.  But it could lead us toward a better understanding of this 
source.)

Professor P. T. Pappas from Greece gave an informative review of the 
theory and his experiments with the creation of energy in sparks and 
discharges.  Pappas points out that in Maxwell's theory, it is assumed 
that there is continuity and the closeness of the path for the flow of 
every current.  He examines the Cardinal current force law of Ampere, 
and claims that energy creation is considered as not binding, but as 
possible, according to this Cardinal law as an alternative principle to 
the continuous creation hypothesis of Astronomy.  Various inherent arc 
oscillations are presented as direct evidence of energy creation.

Wingate Lambertson (1991) discussed the WIN Process as a solid state 
method for converting zero-point energy into electrical energy that has 
been developed over the past 19 years.  He places a semiconductor 
ceramic barrier with a parallel capacitance between an oscillating tank 
circuit and a power supply.  He has included test results that indicate 
a power input of 84 Watt-sec producing an output of 810 Watt-sec, for an 
over-unity ratio of 9.6.

Rhetta Jacobson (1991) summarized an evaluation of Tesla Bladeless pumps 
and turbines.  As these pumps use the fluid friction to operate, she 
finds that:  "no other pump or engine can match the longevity, economy, 
size, safety, silence and vibration free performance of these devices."

While not specially related to energy conversion devices, Glen Rein 
(1991) presented results of his research with cell culture bioassays and 
the effects of time varying quantum potentials.  I feel this work is 
extremely important.  A modified caduceus coil was used to test the 
hypothesis that bucking (opposite) electromagnetic fields can cancel 
their vector fields and generate a time varying quantum potential (the 
"A field," for those in the know).  These experiments prove the 
existence of the "A field" that Tom Bearden and others refer to that has 
been excluded from the simplified EM equations (thanks to the 
simplifications of Heavyside) taught in physics today.  The coil was 
shown to dramatically stimulate the growth of lymphocytes in culture 
cells, both directly in proximity and indirectly through storing its 
information in water.  For those in the health fields:  think very 
carefully about what is being said here!  Then contact Glen!

Bruce dePalma (1991) points out that the key to understanding and 
explaining the baffling situation of anomalous excess electrical energy 
generation in free energy machines lies in a re-interpretation of 
magnetism as not being a property of the magnet, but of space itself.  
The Primordial Energy Field is then also distorted as a consequence of 
the spatial reaction to the centripetal force field existing within a 
ROTATING magnetized conductor.  Bruce says that a N- machine/Space Power 
Generator is an electrical machine which has the capability of producing 
electrical energy with significantly less mechanical power input than 
the presently employed induction machines.  In 1978, he constructed such 
a rotating device, the Sunburst machine.  In 1985, tests were performed 
under the direction of a well-known Professor Emeritus of Electrical 
Engineering at Stanford University.  The test report quotes:  "Known for 
over 150 years, the Faraday homopolar generator has been claimed to 
provide a basis for so-called free energy generation, in that under 
certain conditions the extraction of electrical output energy is not 
reflected as a corresponding mechanical load to the driving source.  
During 1985 I was invited to test such a machine.  While it did not 
perform as claimed, repeatable data showed anomalous results that did 
not seem to conform to traditional theory.  ... DePalma may been right 
in that there is indeed a situation here whereby energy is being 
obtained from a previously unknown and unexplained source."

While my research estimates that N-machines usually report over-unity 
conversion ratios of 1.00 to 1.20, Bruce reports design improvements 
that could result in a machine with an output/input power ratio of 5:1.  
Many fundamental questions in electromagnetics are reopened by the 
implications of the experiment with a rotating magnetic conductor.  For 
those interested in delving more deeply into these questions, I 
recommend reading Bruce's paper, and his paper reference's 14-18. 

Tom Valone (1991) also presents theoretical and experimental data that 
he has obtained with a Faraday disk, or homopolar generator.  He 
obtained a measured back torque of 0.17 N-m for a 25 Watt generator 
which is in agreement with his theory.  Tom is one of the few 
researchers who has been doing accurate measurements on such devices 
within the US today.  George Hathaway (1991, 1992) is also continuing to 
perform various experiments in Canada.

Richard (Scott) McKie (1991) has designed and tested a small model of a 
PODMOD device:  a Power On Demand MODule.  The circuitry invokes Tesla's 
theories of electron flow, resonance, and magnetism, combined with 
modern theories on high frequency electronics and radio antennas to 
generate power directly, without the inefficient conversion of energy 
from other sources.  A US patent has been filed and granted.  Scott 
claimes to be able to generate output power as much as 4,000 times the 
input power.  Prototypes have been built and tested, including 
independent tests by accredited specialists.  Plans are currently 
underway to build full-scale commercial PODMOD units, to be housed in 
standard 40 foot shipping containers, each having a continuous base-load 
generating capacity of 10 megaWatts.

Don Kelly (1991) presented a very good review of the Methernitha free 
energy machine, also known as the Swiss M-L Converter, or the "Thesta-
Distatica."  The spiritual and communal group of Methernitha is located 
in Switzerland, and a videotape might be available from Don at the Space 
Energy Association that summarizes their community and shows the device 
in operation.  An English transcription of that video is also available 
(Methernitha, 1989).  The device contains two counterrotating disks 
(about two feet in diameter) that are set in motion by hand.  They 
continue to spin thereafter, and the machine generates usable power that 
lights or powers small tools.  The device appears to operate 
continuously and generates a continuous 3 to 4 kiloWatts power at about 
220 Volts and about 10 Amps DC.  From an analysis of Wimshurst 
electrostatic generators, this would require a power increase factor, or 
over-unity factor of about 20.  Groups of investigative scientists from 
Europe and Japan have been allowed to examine the device in the 1980s, 
and have all verified these claims without understanding the machines 
principles of operation (Nieper, Hans A., 1981).

Methernitha is committed to not release details on their device, as they 
believe that present mankind is not ready for such advanced energy 
technology.  Their point of view is adequately summarized in a quote 
from a typed letter from Methernitha in 1988:  

"To surprise present mankind with a free-energy device would literally 
mean to pour oil into a world which is already set on fire in too many 
places and domains of human life.  What mankind needs is peace, peace of 
mind to start with, to have a chance to find back to nature and god, and 
not more and further technological support in his strife for pleasure, 
which would rather drown him in an ocean of noise, over-action and 
pollution in general.  If you can not accept this point of view please 
discover a new 'free'-energy device by yourself.  The responsibility for 
its publication with all of its consequences will then be yours only.  
May peace be with you.  Methernitha."

>From the videotape (or the transcription published in 1989), Methernitha 
states:

"This wondermachine is lurked from nature, nothing else.  Nature is the 
greatest source of power as well as knowledge which man has, and it 
still conceals many secrets, which are only revealed to those, who 
approach and tie in them with highest respect and responsibility."  "In 
order to understand nature and to perceive its voice, man is obliged to 
experience silence and solitude, and it was there, where the knowledge 
about this technology was obtained."  "To the educated physicist many a 
thing of this machine may seem impossible, maybe even crazy.  Maybe he 
is also offended by the conceptions used to explain the whole.  Only 
partly we could use the concepts of conventional physical terminology in 
order to explain and define only approximately the functions and 
properties of the various parts of the machine."  "It has to be 
remembered that the established sciences were already many times forced 
to change or give up some of their very fundamental concepts.  Think 
about Galileo Galilei, in order to name only one example.  Our human 
society almost condemned this man as a sorcerer and magician, just 
because he investigated and discovered a truth which seemed unacceptable 
by the established science of the days."  "The book of knowledge is not 
wrong, but it is incomplete, and therefore allows to draw wrong 
conclusions."  "We are part of a new era which brings to light many new 
facts and new knowledge.  The clothes of nowaday science have become too 
tight and should be stripped off, just like the larva of an insect does 
with its skin.  Only this will allow a true metamorphosis to take its 
course, and finally, at the limits and at the destination of all worldly 
knowledge, a universal and unlimited spiritual science, radiating and 
beautiful, just as the completed imago of an insect, may give its 
blessings and benediction to a renovated humanity."

Tom Bearden (1991) described a Vacuum Triode developed by Sweet.  I have 
seen Tom's videotape of this device in operation, when it was operating.  
Tom considers the highly nonlinear nucleus of the atom as a pumped phase 
conjugate mirror (PPCM).  He likens this effect to a triode tube since 
the amplified phase conjugate replica of the signal wave is much like 
the amplified output of a triode, and the input to a PPCM is much like a 
triode's grid signal input. 

Sweet has developed working devices based upon this vacuum triode 
concept utilizing paired barium ferrite magnets and resonant circuits.  
It should be noted that in order for the device to work, the magnets 
were preconditioned by an undisclosed process.  Devices have been 
reported and demonstrated to reliable witness that have produced 
continuous 6, 500, and 5,000 Watts output from a nine volt DC battery.  
Through Tom's theoretical suggestions, the circuit was modified to test 
possible antigravity effects.  The test results performed by Sweet alone 
indicated a 90% weight reduction of the device itself, from 6 pounds to 
about 20 ounces on a spring scale, when the external load was increased 
from 0 to 10 Watts.  To my knowledge, no further tests have been 
performed with this device, as Sweet has had severe heath and family 
difficulties.

Devices Worthy of Future Study

It is difficult to separate which devices should be considered as more 
important or better to research than the others listed in this paper.  
All have potential merit and application.  However;  for a first step, 
what is really needed is repeatable experimental evidence of a new 
potential source, to produce the so-called zero point energy, free 
energy, or over-unity effects.  As funding is presently limited, the 
lack of resources limits our research to simple and uncomplicated 
devices.  I would recommend the following devices, in order of 
increasing complexity and financial commitment, as worthy of careful 
attention and rapid duplication:

Kelly's Soviet Resonant Circuit, A Computer Model and Analyses;
Bedini Free Energy Generator (Brand new motorcycle battery);
Hickox's Electric Dynamo (US Patent No. 4,249,096);
Kelly's Soviet Resonant Circuit;
Russell's Counter-wound Overlapping Conical Coil Designs;
dePalma's and Valone's Homopolar Polar N-Machine Generator;
Brown's Radioactive Decay Resonant Circuit (US Patent No. 4,835,433);
Hyde's Electrostatic Energy Field Power Generating System, (US Patent 
No. 4,897,592);
Sweet's Vacuum Triode;
McKie's PODMOD Generation Device;  and
Methernitha's Swiss M-L Converter.

Summary

Of all of the devices reported herein, I know of none that have been 
adequately tested and accepted to allow unconditional support of their 
claims, nor have any of these devices been replicated or reproduced by 
another party to confirm their operation.  The devices that appear most 
promising appear to be held as proprietary or secretive for financial, 
legal, or philosophical reasons.  This very frustrating situation is 
being actively overcome by the creation of a dedicated and growing 
network of interested scientists and engineers, that are providing 
accurate and honest information transfer, pooling resources, and looking 
ahead to create, organize, and provide adequate financial support that 
works.

Business Plan

What is needed is an international organization that is committed to the 
study of these fields and the support of its researchers.  Such an 
organization cannot survive within the United States alone.  What is 
proposed is a three step plan:  (1)  The creation of an annual advanced 
energy conference to bring together those who will openly discuss ideas, 
experiments, and devices;  (2)  The creation of an international non-
profit corporation that would support these activities and extend and 
network these conferences internationally;  and (3) The creation of a  
financial dividend structure that would allow all participants to gain 
from the success of others.  Research and advancement done at the 
expense of others must become a thing of the past.

Acknowledgments

I thank all of the researchers and authors that have promoted these 
ideas and have placed themselves on the line in the face of so-called 
adversity.  I also thank the staff and promoters of the IANS for 
conducting this conference, and I thank Tom Bearden for allowing me to 
take his place during this conference in his absence.  Finally, I thank 
myself and my higher guides for allowing me to be able to continue to 
increase my consciousness, to learn to accept knowledge without fear, 
and to accurately transmit that knowledge to others.

INSIGHTS INTO THE PROPRIETARY SYNDROME

By KEN MacNEILL

Cadake Industries
Winter Haven, Florida

PART I

To give you some background on myself, I have been interested in the 
energy situation since I can remember.  I have built all kinds of 
devices, solar energy panels, windmills, photovoltaic arrays, flywheel 
devices, and also carburetors of which I will talk on Sunday.  In my 
background I am an accomplished tool and diemaker, moldmaker, been 
involved in Design Engineering for the past 12 years, primarily in the 
automation area.

My first real involvement with other people in this alternate energy 
area was at the Toronto Symposium in 1981 where I met George Hathaway as 
well as over 100 other people that believe in the impossible according 
to orthodox science.  Since that time I have made myself aware of just 
about everything that is happening in this field, and believe me there 
are some really fantastic things going on.  The rediscovery of some of 
the technology that was lost in the past is finally coming to 
realization, for instance the Tesla technology, the Hubbard device, the 
Moray approach to tapping into the free energy supply that we're sitting 
in without even knowing it.

A friend of mine gave me a real insight possibly without even knowing 
it.  He said the problem could only be solved by just considering the 
problem of weighing a glass of water at 500 feet under water.  Here you 
are under water with a glass of water:  how do you weigh it???

The analogy is the same for us.  Here we sit in the vastness of the 
cosmos on top of one of the biggest magnets known to us and we are like 
the glass of water.  We are in the vast ocean of energy.  Look around us 
and watch just the weather for instance, the next thunderstorm, think of 
all the electrical potential being wasted.  That energy is there;  it is 
very real.

Tom Bearden, one of our upcoming speakers, may have illustrated it quite 
well by the bird sitting on top of the wire with 13,000 volts going 
through it.  We all know that it could kill him but it doesn't.  I am 
positive that within this group will be the ways and means for making 
the energy situation of the future change.  

Now to the other side of this coin.  Why has not this technology been 
allowed to become established?  We have to look at the 'profit motive' 
involved.  If we have free energy, how will they charge for it?  What 
will happen to the billions of dollars that the utilities and oil 
companies and the government backing these establishments do if we can 
give the people independence from the chains of having to pay for 
energy?

One question that has been uppermost in my mind for the last year has 
been the rhetoric given by our elected representatives about the energy 
situation and the amount of money given to small researchers who could 
possibly give us a viable approach to becoming energy independent.  Who 
gets the government money??  Let me get a little audience participation 
in the question.  How many of you have all the money you need for 
research in the energy area?  Everyone who has please stand!!!!!  Now 
let me mention a few of the names of the companies that get the money.  
See if you recognize them:  Exxon, Gulf Oil, General Electric, 
Westinghouse, TRW, Exide Storage Battery, all manufacturers or producers 
of fossil fuel products.  We need to get away from the fossil fuels for 
the future and get into something that can indeed give us a future 
because we are rapidly depleting not only our natural resources but our 
air and water.  All because of burning fossil fuels.  We fund our 
universities and colleges in the most directed of ways.  If you want to 
explore the possibilities in some of the more esoteric areas, for 
instance the ones you will be hearing about in the next three days, 
there is no money for that.  WHY???  Because of the possibility that we 
might succeed.  What would our government do if all the American people 
could go back and forth to work, heat their homes, run their businesses 
without paying taxes on gas and oil?  Consider the fact that all of the 
gas stations would go out of business or would have to find other ways 
of making money.  Many complimentary businesses would also fold.  But 
alas, this is America.  What are we here for???  To perpetuate Big 
Business, Big Government, or to advance toward the future, not expending 
all of our natural resources but to save them to make the goods of the 
future.  Coal and oil both can be used for making all kinds of things 
besides fuels;  the list is endless.

It is my feeling that the technology may be already here and may have 
been shown to the government.  It even may have been introduced to our 
patent office and turned down.  Because as you know, there is no such 
thing as a perpetual motion device.  And I agree with the premise 
because forever is a long time.  

But there are surely some of the devices or parts thereof that have been 
introduced to the government or to big business in the past which have 
been shelved.  Tesla's transmission device is a classic illustration 
probably best known to this group.  What happened is that they removed 
the money from him to do his research and effectively stifled this 
remarkable man.  How many other times has it happened to someone not so 
well known?  At this moment, there are over 3,000 devices or 
applications in the patent office that have been branded as security or 
put under wraps by the secrecy order, Title 35, U.S. Code (1952) 
Sections 181-188.  What is security?  How is it defined?  I have had 
many inventors or other scientists tell me that they did not want to 
discuss their invention with me or others because they might lose it to 
us or we might tell someone else before they got it onto the market.  
Believe me, it won't get there by going through the patent process.  It 
is my feeling that if such a device were introduced at this level, then 
it would be put under the Secrecy Act.  I don't know that I am correct 
in this assumption.  But I cannot imagine a government like ours wanting 
to commit financial suicide.  So what better way than to brand something 
as a secret?  

I would like to read the Secrecy Order to you so that you may better 
understand my concern.  Please pay close attention.  I think it is very 
important.  To you or anyone!!!  Consider your receiving this:


SECRECY ORDER
(Title 35, United States Code (1952), sections 181-188)

NOTICE:  To the applicant above named, his heirs, and any and all of his 
assignees, attorneys and agents, hereinafter designated principals:

You are hereby notified that your application as above identified has 
been found to contain subject matter, the unauthorized disclosure of 
which might be detrimental to the national security, and you are ordered 
in nowise to publish or disclose the invention or any material 
information with respect thereto, including hitherto unpublished details 
of the subject matter of said application, in any way to any person not 
cognizant of the invention prior to the date of the order, including any 
employee of the principals, but to keep the same secret except by 
written consent first obtained of the Commissioner of Patents, under the 
penalties of 35 U.S.C. (1952) 182, 186.

Any other application already filed or hereafter filed which contains 
any significant part of the subject matter of the above identified 
application falls within the scope of this order.  If such other 
application does not stand under a security order, it and the common 
subject matter should be brought to the attention of the Security Group, 
Licensing and Review, Patent Office.

If, prior to the issuance of the secrecy order, any significant part of 
the subject matter has been revealed to any person, the principals shall 
promptly inform such person of the secrecy order and the penalties for 
improper disclosure.  However, if such part of the subject matter was 
disclosed to any person in a foreign country or foreign national in the 
U.S., the principals shall not inform such person of the secrecy order, 
but instead shall promptly furnish to the Commissioner of Patents the 
following information to the extent not already furnished:  date of 
disclosure;  name and address of the disclosee;  identification of such 
part;  and any authorization by a U.S. government agency to export such 
part.  If the subject matter is included in any foreign patent 
application, or patent, this should be identified.  The principals shall 
comply with any related instructions of the Commissioner.

This order should not be construed in any way to mean that the 
Government has adopted or contemplates adoption of the alleged invention 
disclosed in this application;  nor is it any indication of the value of 
such invention.

It is my feeling that something on the order of a so-called 'free energy 
device' would receive this treatment.  My only approach would be to go 
to the public domain.  That is, get the information or the device out 
there to enough people that they could not stop you.  This group looks 
like the best group to give this information to.  Hopefully it will 
forthcoming in the next three days.
