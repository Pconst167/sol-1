                   Precautions for Safe Handling and Use
===========================================================================
Steps If Matl Released/Spill: AVOID USING COMPRESSED AIR TO MANEUVER
SPILLS/LEAKS OF FINE MATERIAL. FINE MATERIAL SHOULD BE SWEPT UP/VACUUMED.
NO PROBLEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH SPILLS/LEAKS OF LUMP MATERIAL. KEEP WET
MATERIAL SEPARATED FROM DRY MATERIAL. *
Neutralizing Agent: NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER. *
Waste Disposal Method: AVOID REPACKING WET MATERIAL IN SEALED CONTAINERS.
DISPOSE OF I/A/W APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL REGULATIONS. *
Precautions-Handling/Storing: EXCLUDE CONT W/MOISTURE & ACIDS AS MUCH AS
POSS. CALCIUM-SILICON ALLOYS SHOULD BE KEPT AWAY FROM SPARKS, HEAT & OPEN
FLAMES IN A WELL VENTD AREA. *
Other Precautions: MILLING: SPECIAL PREC, SUCH AS USE OF INERT ATMOSPHERE,
SHOULD BE USED WHEN SIZING TO MINUS 8 MESH. MINIMIZE AND CONTROL DUSTY
OPERATIONS. GRINDING WET MATL MAY BE HAZ DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HYDROGEN
EVOLUTION. *
===========================================================================
                             Control Measures
===========================================================================
Respiratory Protection: IN DUSTY AREAS, USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SCHEDULE
21C RESPIRATOR. *
Ventilation: LOCAL FOR DUSTY AREAS. PROVIDE VENTILATION DURING STORAGE OR
HANDLING OF MOIST MATERIAL. *
Protective Gloves: IMPERVIOUS GLOVES (FP N). * 
Eye Protection: ANSI APVD CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES (FP N) * 
Other Protective Equipment: AS WITH OTHER METAL DUSTS AVOID CONTAMINATION
OF WORK CLOTHING. *
Work Hygienic Practices: NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER. *
Suppl. Safety & Health Data: MP:>1292F,>700C. EXTING MEDIA: BURN ITSELF
OUT. DO NOT DISTURB METAL WHILE EXTING FIRE. EXPLO HAZ: READILY, GENERATE
IARC MONOGRAPHS ON EVAL OF CARCIN RISK OF CHEM (ING 7) *
