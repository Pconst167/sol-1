EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE
  EXCESSIVE INHALATION OF DUST IS IRRITATING AND MAY BE SEVERELY DAMAGING
  TO RESPIRATORY PASSAGES AND/OR LUNGS.
  CONTACT WITH SKIN OR EYES MAY CAUSE SEVERE IRRITATION OR BURNS.
  SUBSTANCE IS READILY ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN.
  INGESTION MAY CAUSE NAUSEA, VOMITING, GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITATION, AND
  BURNS TO MOUTH AND THROAT.
  PROLONGED INHALATION OF MANGANESE IN THE FORM OF ITS INORGANIC COMPOUNDS
  MAY CAUSE MANGANISM.

TARGET ORGANS
  RESPIRATORY SYSTEM, CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, BLOOD, KIDNEYS

MEDICAL CONDITIONS GENERALLY AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE
  DAMAGED SKIN

ROUTES OF ENTRY
  INGESTION, INHALATION

EMERGENCY AND FIRST AID PROCEDURES
  CALL A PHYSICIAN.
  IF SWALLOWED, DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING; IF CONSCIOUS, GIVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF
  WATER.  FOLLOW WITH DILUTED VINEGAR, FRUIT JUICE OR WHITES OF EGGS, BEATEN
  WITH WATER.
  IF INHALED, REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.  IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL
  RESPIRATION.  IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN.
  IN CASE OF CONTACT, IMMEDIATELY FLUSH EYES OR SKIN WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR
  AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPS TO BE TAKEN IN THE EVENT OF A SPILL OR DISCHARGE
  WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS AND FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.
  KEEP COMBUSTIBLES (WOOD, PAPER, OIL, ETC.) AWAY FROM SPILLED MATERIAL.
  WITH CLEAN SHOVEL, CAREFULLY PLACE MATERIAL INTO CLEAN, DRY CONTAINER AND
  COVER; REMOVE FROM AREA.  FLUSH SPILL AREA WITH WATER.

VENTILATION:             USE GENERAL OR LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION TO MEET
                         TLV REQUIREMENTS.

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:  NONE REQUIRED WHERE ADEQUATE VENTILATION
                         CONDITIONS EXIST.  IF AIRBORNE CONCENTRATION
                         EXCEEDS TLV, A DUST/MIST RESPIRATOR IS
                         RECOMMENDED.  IF CONCENTRATION EXCEEDS CAPACITY OF
                         RESPIRATOR, A SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS
                         IS ADVISED.

EYE/SKIN PROTECTION:     SAFETY GLASSES WITH SIDESHIELDS, UNIFORM, BUTYL
                         RUBBER GLOVES ARE RECOMMENDED.
