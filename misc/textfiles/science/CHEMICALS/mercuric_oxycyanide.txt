      permanent brain damage. 
 *    Skin contact can cause irritation, skin allergy, or a gray 
      skin color. 
 *    Eye contact causes irritation. 
 *    Heating or use near acid can release toxic Mercury and Cyanide 
      vapors. 
 *    Health effects have been reported below NIOSH exposure levels. 
 
 IDENTIFICATION 
 Mercuric Oxycyanide is a white crystalline powder (sugar or sand- 
 like).  It has been used in medicine as a topical antiseptic. 
 
 REASON FOR CITATION 
 *    Mercuric Oxycyanide is on the Hazardous Substance List because 
      it is cited by NIOSH, ACGIH and DOT. 
 
 HOW TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE BEING EXPOSED 
 *    Exposure to hazardous substances should be routinely 
      evaluated. This may include collecting personal and area air 
      samples.  You can obtain copies of sampling results from your 
      employer. You have a legal right to this information under 
      OSHA 1910.20. 
 *    If you think you are experiencing any work-related health 
      problems, see a doctor trained to recognize occupational 
      diseases. Take this Fact Sheet with you.

 WORKPLACE EXPOSURE LIMITS 
 OSHA:     The legal airborne permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 
           0.1 mg/m3 for Mercury and inorganic compounds measured as 
           Mercury, not to be exceeded at any time.  
 NIOSH:    The recommended airborne exposure limit is 0.05 mg/m3 
           averaged over an 8 hour workshift for Mercury, inorganic, 
           and measured as Mercury.  
 ACGIH:    The recommended airborne exposure limit is 0.1 mg/m3 for 
           inorganic compounds and 0.05 mg/m3 of Mercury vapor 
           averaged over an 8-hour workshift and measured as 
           Mercury. 
 
 *    The above exposure limits are for air levels only. When skin 
      contact also occurs, you may be overexposed, even though air 
      levels are less than the limits listed above. 
 
 WAYS OF REDUCING EXPOSURE 
 *    Where possible, enclose operations and use local exhaust 
      ventilation at the site of chemical release.  If local exhaust 
      ventilation or enclosure is not used, respirators should be 
      worn. 
 *    Wear protective work clothing. 
 *    Wash thoroughly immediately after exposure to Mercuric 
      Oxycyanide and at the end of the workshift. 
 *    Post hazard and warning information in the work area.  In 
      addition, as part of an ongoing education and training effort, 
      communicate all information on the health and safety hazards 
      of Mercuric Oxycyanide to potentially exposed workers.  
 
 This Fact Sheet is a summary source of information of all potential 
 and most severe health hazards that may result from exposure.  
 Duration of exposure, concentration of the substance and other 
 factors will affect your susceptibility to any of the potential 
 effects described below. 
 ------------------------------------------ 
 
 HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION 
 
 Acute Health Effects 
 The following acute (short-term) health effects may occur 
 immediately or shortly after exposure to Mercuric Oxycyanide: 
 
 *    Mercuric Oxycyanide can affect you when breathed in and by 
      passing through your skin. 
 *    Direct contact causes eye irritation and possible damage and 
      may irritate the skin. 
 *    Heating or contact with acid or acid mist causes release of 
      toxic Mercury and Cyanide vapors and lung effects of 
      bronchitis and phlegm and/or lung irritation.  Overexposure to 
      Cyanide can cause sudden death. 
 *    Breathing Mercuric Oxycyanide causes irritation of the throat 
      and air passages. 
 
 Chronic Health Effects 
 The following chronic (long-term) health effects can occur at some 
 time after exposure to Mercuric Oxycyanide and can last for months 
 or years: 
 
 Cancer Hazard 
 *    According to the information presently available to the New 
      Jersey Department of Health, Mercuric Oxycyanide has not been 
      tested for its ability to cause cancer in animals. 
 
 Reproductive Hazard 
 *    Mercuric Oxycyanide has not been tested for its ability to 
      cause reproductive damage, but it should be HANDLED WITH 
      CAUTION since some related Mercury compounds damage the 
      developing fetus and decrease fertility in males and females. 
 *    Organic Mercury substances (organic substances are those which 
      contain carbon) have been identified as human teratogens.  
      While inorganic Mercury substances (those without carbon) such 
      as Mercuric Oxycyanide have not been shown to be human 
      teratogens, they still should be handled with caution as they 
      may cause reproductive problems in males and females. 
 
 Other Long-Term Effects 
 *    High or repeated exposure can cause kidney damage or Mercury 
      poisoning.  Mercury poisoning causes sore gums, "shakes" 
      (often with shaky handwriting), irritability and increased 
      saliva.  Other changes may include memory loss, extreme 
      shyness, weakness,  poor appetite and metallic taste.  Serious 
      personality changes and brain damage may occur, especially if 
      exposure continues. 
 *    Repeated skin contact may make the skin turn gray. 
 *    Exposure can also cause brown staining in the eye and may 
      affect peripheral vision (the ability to see to the side). 
 *    Skin allergy may also occur.  If this happens, even small 
      future exposures can cause rash. 
 *    Mercury can accumulate in the body with repeated exposure.  It 
      can take months or years for the body to get rid of excess 
      Mercury. 
 
 MEDICAL 
 
 Medical Testing 
 Before first exposure and every 6 to 12 months after, a complete 
 medical history and exam is strongly recommended, with: 
 
 *    Exam of the nervous system, including handwriting. 
 *    Routine urine test (UA). 
 *    Urine test for Mercury (should be less than 0.02 mg/liter). 
 *    Eye exam. 
 
 After suspected illness or overexposure, repeat the tests above AND 
 get a blood test for Mercury. 
 
 Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and present 
 symptoms with an exam.  Medical tests that look for damage already 
 done are not a substitute for controlling exposure. Request copies 
 of your medical testing.  You have a legal right to this 
 information under OSHA 1910.20. 
 
 Mixed Exposures 
 Creams to whiten or bleach skin may contain Mercury; if so, their 
 use increases risk. 
 
 Conditions Made Worse By Exposure 
 Persons allergic to Mercury may also react to Mercurochrome or 
 Merthiolate, which contain Mercury. 
 
 WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES 
 
 Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous 
 substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most effective way of 
 reducing exposure.  The best protection is to enclose operations 
 and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at the site of chemical 
 release.  Isolating operations can also reduce exposure.  Using 
 respirators or protective equipment is less effective than the 
 controls mentioned above, but is sometimes necessary. 
 
 In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider: (1) 
 how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the substance is 
 released into the workplace and (3) whether harmful skin or eye 
 contact could occur.  Special controls should be in place  for 
 highly toxic chemicals or when significant skin, eye, or breathing 
 exposures are possible. 
 
 In addition, the following controls are recommended: 
 
 *    Vigorous, periodic cleaning of all work surfaces. 
 *    Where possible, automatically transfer Mercuric Oxycyanide 
      from drums or other storage containers to process containers. 
 *    Specific engineering controls are recommended for this 
      chemical by NIOSH. Refer to the NIOSH criteria document: 
      Occupational Exposures to inorganic Mercury #73-11024 and 
      Hydrogen Cyanide and Cyanide Salts #77-108. 
 
 Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous exposures.  The 
 following work practices are recommended: 
 
 *    Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by Mercuric 
      Oxycyanide should change into clean clothing promptly. 
 *    Do not take contaminated work clothes home.  Family members 
      could be exposed. 
 *    Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by individuals 
      who have been informed of the hazards of exposure to Mercuric 
      Oxycyanide. 
 *    Eye wash fountains should be provided in the immediate work 
      area for emergency use. 
 *    On skin contact with Mercuric Oxycyanide, immediately wash or 
      shower to remove the chemical.  At the end of the workshift, 
      wash any areas of the body that may have contacted Mercuric 
      Oxycyanide, whether or not known skin contact has occurred. 
 *    Do not eat, smoke, or drink where Mercuric Oxycyanide is 
      handled, processed, or stored, since the chemical can be 
      swallowed.  Wash hands carefully before eating or smoking. 
 *    For clean-up use a specialized charcoal-filtered vacuum or 
      suction pump to avoid generating Mercury vapor.  Care should 
      be taken not to disturb spilled material. 
 
 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
 
 WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. 
 However, for some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, 
 jobs done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace 
 controls are being installed), personal protective equipment may be 
 appropriate. 
 
 The following recommendations are only guidelines and may not apply 
 to every situation. 
 
 Clothing 
 *    Avoid skin contact with Mercuric Oxycyanide.  Wear protective 
      gloves and clothing. Safety equipment suppliers/ manufacturers 
      can provide recommendations on the most protective glove/ 
      clothing material for your operation. 
 *    Non-absorbent materials are recommended. 
 *    All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear) 
      should be clean, available each day and put on before work. 
 
 Eye Protection 
 *    Wear dust-proof goggles and face shield when working with 
      powders or dust, unless full facepiece respiratory protection 
      is worn. 
 
 Respiratory Protection 
 IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS.  Such equipment should 
 only be used if the employer has a written program that takes into 
 account workplace conditions, requirements for worker training, 
 respirator fit testing and medical exams, as described in OSHA 
 1910.134. 
 
 *    Where the potential exists for exposures over 0.05 mg/m3 as 
      Mercury, use a MSHA/NIOSH approved supplied-air respirator 
      with a full facepiece operated in the positive pressure mode 
      or with a full facepiece, hood, or helmet in the continuous 
      flow mode, or use a MSHA/ NIOSH approved self-contained 
      breathing apparatus with a full facepiece operated in 
      pressure-demand or other positive pressure mode. 
 
 ADDITIONAL WORKPLACE EXPOSURE LIMITS for Cyanides measured as 
 Cyanide. 
 
 OSHA:     The legal airborne permissible exposure limit (PEL) is 5 
           mg/m3 averaged over an 8-hour work-shift.  
 NIOSH:    The recommended airborne exposure limit is 5 mg/m3, which 
           should not be exceeded during any 10 minute work period. 
 ACGIH:    The recommended airborne exposure limit is 5 mg/m3 
           averaged over an 8-hour workshift.

 ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION 
 
 Elemental mercury is a heavy and relatively inert liquid which is 
 oxidized to inorganic mercury (II) under natural conditions.  
 Mercury (II) may combine with an organic fraction to from 
 methylmercury.  Both mercury (II) and methylmercury are of 
 environmental concern.  Mercury (II) may enter the environment in 
 industrial or municipal waste treatment discharges, from previously 
 contaminated sediments, and from the weathering of natural rocks.  
 Bacteria may then convert it into methylmercury.  The concentration 
 of mercury (II) in bodies of water may be elevated with acid rain 
 due to the scouring of mercury from the air and increased 
 partitioning from the sediment into the water. 
 
 ACUTE (SHORT TERM) ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS 
 
 Acute toxic effects may include the death of animals, birds, or 
 fish, and death or low growth rate in plants.  Acute effects are 
 seen two to four days after animals or plants come in contact with 
 a toxic chemical substance. 
 
 Mercury(II) and methylmercury has high acute toxicity to aquatic 
 life.  Insufficient data are available to evaluate or predict the 
 short term effects of mercury (II) or methylmercury to plants, 
 birds, or land animals. 
 
 CHRONIC (LONG-TERM) ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS 
 
 Chronic toxic effects may include shortened lifespan, reproductive 
 problems, lower fertility, and changes in appearance or behavior.  
 Chronic effects can be seen long after first exposure(s) to a 
 toxic chemical. 
 
 Mercury (II) and methylmercury have high chronic toxicity to 
 aquatic life.  Eating fish contaminated with mercury residues has 
 caused secondary poisoning in humans: birds or land animals 
 similarly exposed to mercury and its compounds  could also be 
 subject to such effects.  Insufficient data are available to 
 evaluate or predict the long-term effects of mercury and its 
 compounds to plants. 
 
 DISTRIBUTION AND PERSISTENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Mercury is highly persistent in water, with a half-life greater 
 than 200 days.  The half-life of a pollutant is the amount of time 
 it takes for one-half of the chemical to be degraded. 
 
 
 BIOACCUMULATION IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS 
 
 Some substances increase in concentration, or bioaccumulate, in 
 living organisms as they breathe contaminated air, drink 
 contaminated water, or eat contaminated food.  These chemicals can 
 become concentrated in the tissues and internal organs of animals 
 and humans. 
 The concentration of mercury(II) and methylmercury found in fish 
 tissues is expected to be considerably higher than the average 
 concentration of mercury(II) or methylmercury in the water from 
 which the fish was taken.
