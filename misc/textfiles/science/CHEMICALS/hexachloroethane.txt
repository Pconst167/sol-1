SECTION VI.  TOXICITY AND HEALTH HAZARD DATA

  A.  EXPOSURE LIMITS:
      Threshold Limit Value (TLV): 1 ppm, 8-hr TWA, ACGIH 1990-1991.
      Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL): 1 ppm (skin), OSHA.

  B.  EXPOSURE EFFECTS: Exposure to high concentrations may cause liver and
      kidney damage.

      Carcinogenicity Status: Hexachloroethane has been identified as a
      carcinogen or potential carcinogen for hazard communication purposes by:

        California:  WARNING.  Hexachloroethane is known to the State of
          California to cause cancer.

      Inhalation: Harmful if inhaled.  Dust or vapor irritating to the
      respiratory tract.
      Skin: Harmful if absorbed through the skin.
      Eye: Causes eye irritation.
      Ingestion: Harmful if swallowed.  Ingestion of large amounts may cause
      central nervous system depression based on animal data.

  C.  FIRST AID:
      Inhalation: Remove to fresh air.  Treat symptomatically.  If symptoms
      are present get medical attention.
      Skin: In case of contact, immediately flush skin with plenty of water
      for at least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and
      shoes.  Wash contaminated clothing before reuse.  Destroy or thoroughly
      clean contaminated shoes.  If symptoms are present after washing, get
      medical attention.
      Eye: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15
      minutes and get medical attention.
      Ingestion: If swallowed, induce vomiting immediately as directed by
      medical personnel.  Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious
      person.  Call a physician or poison control center immediately.
==============================================================================

SECTION VII.  VENTILATION AND PERSONAL PROTECTION

  A.  VENTILATION:
      Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or other engineering
      controls to reduce dust concentrations to an acceptable level.

  B.  RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:
      If engineering controls are inadequate to control dust concentrations
      to an acceptable level, a NIOSH-approved dust or vapor respirator
      should be worn if needed.  If respirators are used, a program should be
      instituted to assure compliance with OSHA Standard 29 CFR 1910.134.

  C.  SKIN AND EYE PROTECTION:
      Protective gloves and clothing should be worn. Safety glasses, goggles,
      or a face shield should be worn.
==============================================================================

SECTION VIII.  SPECIAL STORAGE AND HANDLING PRECAUTIONS

  Keep from contact with oxidizing materials, metals or bases.  Do not store
  in metal containers.
==============================================================================

SECTION IX.  SPILL, LEAK, AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

  Sweep up material and package for safe feed to an incinerator.  Dispose by
  incineration or contract with licensed chemical waste disposal agency.
  Discharge, treatment, or disposal may be subject to federal, state or local
  laws.
