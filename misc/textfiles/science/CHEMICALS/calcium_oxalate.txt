SECTION IX.  SPILL, LEAK, AND DISPOSAL PROCEDURES

              Sweep material onto paper and place in fiber carton.
              Package appropriately for safe feed to an incinerator or
              dissolve in compatible waste solvents prior to incineration.
              Dispose by incineration or contract with licensed chemical
              waste disposal agency.
              Discharge, treatment, or disposal may be subject to federal,
              state, or local laws.

SECTION X.    ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS DATA

    A.   SUMMARY:
              This chemical has not been tested for environmental effects.
              Some published data are available for oxalic acid and oxalate
              anion, and these data have been used to provide the following
              estimate of environmental impact:

              This chemical has a moderate biological oxygen demand and it
              may cause oxygen depletion in aquatic systems.  It is expected
              to have a low potential to affect aquatic organisms.  The
              organic portion of this chemical is readily biodegradable and
              is not likely to bioconcentrate.  When diluted with water, this
              chemical released directly or indirectly into the environment
              is not expected to have a significant impact.

              Calcium oxalate is practically insoluble in water and acetic
              acid.6,7  The data below are for oxalic acid and/or sodium
              oxalate.
    B.   OXYGEN DEMAND DATA: (Oxalic acid)(3)
              ThOD:   1.8 g/g
              COD:    0.18 g/g
              BOD5:   0.14 g/g
              BOD20:  0.16 g/g
    C.   ACUTE AQUATIC EFFECTS:
              Goldfish; Period of survival:  0.4 - 0.5 hr, 1000 ppm (pH 2.6);
              4 days, 200 ppm (pH 5.3)(3)
              96-hour LC50; Mosquito Fish:  1350 mg/L (Sodium oxalate)(5)
              96-hour LCo; Water flea:  95 mg/L (Oxalic acid)(4)
              48-hour Immobilization; Water Flea:  214 mg/L (sodium oxalate)
