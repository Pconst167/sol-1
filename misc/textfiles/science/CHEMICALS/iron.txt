VENTILATION:             USE ADEQUATE GENERAL OR LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION
                         TO KEEP FUME OR DUST LEVELS AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:  NONE REQUIRED WHERE ADEQUATE VENTILATION
                         CONDITIONS EXIST.  IF AIRBORNE CONCENTRATION IS
                         HIGH, A DUST/MIST RESPIRATOR IS RECOMMENDED.
                         IF CONCENTRATION EXCEEDS CAPACITY OF RESPIRATOR,
                         A SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS IS ADVISED.

EYE/SKIN PROTECTION:     SAFETY GLASSES WITH SIDESHIELDS, PROPER GLOVES ARE
                         RECOMMENDED.
