 HEALTH HAZARD INFORMATION 
 
 Acute Health Effects 
 The following acute (short term) health effects may occur 
 immediately or shortly after exposure to Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) 
 Adipate: 
 
 *    Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate can irritate the eyes and may burn 
      the skin. 
 Chronic Health Effects 
 The following chronic (long term) health effects can occur at some 
 time after exposure to Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate and can last for 
 months or years: 
 
 Cancer Hazard 
 *    There is limited evidence that Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate 
      causes cancer in animals. It may cause cancer of the liver. 
 *    Many scientists believe there is no safe level of exposure to 
      a carcinogen. Such substances may also have the potential for 
      causing reproductive damage in humans. 
 
 Reproductive Hazard 
 *    There is limited evidence that Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate may 
      damage the developing fetus. 
 *    There is limited evidence that Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate may 
      decrease fertility in males and females. 
 
 Other Long Term Effects 
 *    Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate has not been tested for other 
      chronic (long term) health effects. 
 
 MEDICAL 
 
 Medical Testing 
 Any evaluation should include a careful history of past and present 
 symptoms with an exam. Medical tests that look for damage already 
 done are not a substitute for controlling exposure. 
 
 There is no special test for this chemical. However, if illness 
 occurs or over exposure is suspected, medical attention is 
 recommended. 
 
 Request copies of your medical testing. You have a legal right to 
 this information under OSHA 1910.20. 
 
 WORKPLACE CONTROLS AND PRACTICES 
 
 Unless a less toxic chemical can be substituted for a hazardous 
 substance, ENGINEERING CONTROLS are the most effective way of 
 reducing exposure. The best protection is to enclose operations 
 and/or provide local exhaust ventilation at the site of chemical 
 release. Isolating operations can also reduce exposure. Using 
 respirators or protective equipment is less effective than the 
 controls mentioned above, but is sometimes necessary. 
 
 In evaluating the controls present in your workplace, consider: (1) 
 how hazardous the substance is, (2) how much of the substance is 
 released into the workplace and (3) whether harmful skin or eye 
 contact could occur. Special controls should be in place for highly 
 toxic chemicals or when significant skin, eye, or breathing 
 exposures are possible. 
 
 In addition, the following control is recommended: 
 *    Where possible, automatically pump liquid Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) 
      Adipate from drums or other storage containers to process 
      containers. 
 
 Good WORK PRACTICES can help to reduce hazardous exposures. The 
 following work practices are recommended: 
 
 *    Workers whose clothing has been contaminated by Bis (2- 
      Ethylhexyl) Adipate should change into clean clothing 
      promptly. 
 *    If there is the possibility of skin exposure, emergency shower 
      facilities should be provided. 
 *    Contaminated work clothes should be laundered by individuals 
      who have been informed of the hazards of exposure to Bis (2- 
      Ethylhexyl) Adipate. 
 *    On skin contact with Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate, immediately 
      wash or shower to remove the chemical. At the end of the 
      workshift, wash any areas of the body that may have contacted 
      Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate, whether or not known skin contact 
      has occurred. 
 *    Do not eat, smoke, or drink where Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate 
      is handled, processed, or stored, since the chemical can be 
      swallowed. Wash hands carefully before eating or smoking. 
 
 PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
 
 WORKPLACE CONTROLS ARE BETTER THAN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. 
 However, for some jobs (such as outside work, confined space entry, 
 jobs done only once in a while, or jobs done while workplace 
 controls are being installed), personal protective equipment may be 
 appropriate. 
 
 The following recommendations are only guidelines and may not apply 
 to every situation. 
 
 Clothing 
 *    Avoid skin contact with Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate. Wear 
      protective gloves and clothing. Safety equipment 
      suppliers/manufacturers can provide recommendations on the 
      most protective glove/clothing material for your operation. 
 *    All protective clothing (suits, gloves, footwear, headgear) 
      should be clean, available each day, and put on before work. 
 
 Eye Protection 
 *    Wear splash proof chemical goggles and face shield when 
      working with liquid Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate, unless full 
      facepiece respiratory protection is worn. 
 
 Respiratory Protection 
 IMPROPER USE OF RESPIRATORS IS DANGEROUS. Such equipment should 
 only be used if the employer has a written program that takes into 
 account workplace conditions, requirements for worker training, 
 respirator fit testing and medical exams, as described in OSHA 
 1910.134. 
 *    Engineering controls must be effective to ensure that exposure 
      to Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate does not occur. 
 *    Where the potential exists for exposure to Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) 
      Adipate, use a MSHA/NIOSH approved supplied air respirator 
      with a full facepiece operated in the positive pressure mode 
      or with a full facepiece, hood, or helmet in the continuous 
      flow mode, or use a MSHA/NIOSH approved self contained 
      breathing apparatus with a full facepiece operated in pressure 
      demand or other positive pressure mode.

 life.  Insufficient data are available to evaluate or predict the 
 short-term effects of this chemical to plants, birds, or land 
 animals. 
 
 CHRONIC (LONG-TERM) ECOLOGICAL EFFECTS 
 
 Chronic toxic effects may include shortened lifespan, reproductive 
 problems, lower fertility, and changes in appearance or behavior.  
 Chronic effects can be seen long after first exposure(s) to a toxic 
 chemical. 
 
 Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate has slight chronic toxicity to aquatic 
 life.  Insufficient data are available to evaluate or predict the 
 long-term effects of this chemical to plants, birds, or land 
 animals. 
 
 WATER SOLUBILITY 
 
 Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate is slightly soluble in water.  
 Concentrations of 1 milligram and less will mix with a liter of 
 water. 
 
 DISTRIBUTION AND PERSISTENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT 
 
 Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate is slightly persistent in water, with a 
 half-life of between 2 to 20 days.  The half-life of a pollutant is 
 the amount of time it takes for one-half of the chemical to be 
 degraded.  About 47.5% of this chemical will eventually end up in 
 terrestrial soils; about 44% will end up in aquatic sediments; and 
 the rest will end up in the air. 
 
 BIOACCUMULATION IN AQUATIC ORGANISMS 
 
 Some substances increase in concentration, or bioaccumulate, in 
 living organisms as they breathe contaminated air, drink 
 contaminated water, or eat contaminated food.  These chemicals can 
 become concentrated in the tissues and internal organs of animals 
 and humans. 
 
 The concentration of Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) Adipate found in fish 
 tissues is expected to be considerably higher than the average 
 concentration of this chemical in the water from which the fish was 
 taken.
