Appearance: not available.



Target Organs: None.

Potential Health Effects
     The toxicological properties of this material have not been
     investigated. Use appropriate procedures to prevent opportunities
     for direct contact with the skin or eyes and to prevent inhalation.

                    **** SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES ****

     Eyes:
          Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes,
          occasionally lifting the upper and lower lids.
     Skin:
          Flush skin with plenty of soap and water for at least 15 minutes
          while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.
     Ingestion:
          DO NOT induce vomiting. Allow the victim to rinse his mouth and then
          to drink 2-4 cupfuls of water, and seek medical advice.
     Inhalation:
          Remove from exposure to fresh air immediately.
     Notes to Physician:
          Treat symptomatically.
          No specific antidote exists.

                  **** SECTION 5 - FIRE FIGHTING MEASURES ****

     General Information:
          As in any fire, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus in
          pressure-demand, MSHA/NIOSH (approved or equivalent), and full
          protective gear. During a fire, irritating and highly toxic gases
          may be generated by thermal decomposition or combustion.
     Extinguishing Media:
          Use agent most appropriate to extinguish fire.
     Autoignition Temperature: Not available.
     Flash Point: Not available.
     NFPA Rating: Not published.
     Explosion Limits, Lower: Not available.
                       Upper: Not available.

                **** SECTION 6 - ACCIDENTAL RELEASE MEASURES ****

     General Information: Use proper personal protective equipment as indicated
                          in Section 8.
     Spills/Leaks:
          Clean up spills immediately, observing precautions in the Protective
          Equipment section. Sweep up, then place into a suitable container for
          disposal.

                   **** SECTION 7 - HANDLING and STORAGE ****

     Handling:
          Wash thoroughly after handling. Remove contaminated clothing and
          wash before reuse. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. Avoid
          ingestion and inhalation.
     Storage:
          Store in a cool, dry place. Keep container closed when not in use.

          **** SECTION 8 - EXPOSURE CONTROLS, PERSONAL PROTECTION ****

     Engineering Controls:
          Use adequate general or local exhaust ventilation to keep airborne
          concentrations below the permissible exposure limits. Use process
          enclosure, local exhaust ventilation, or other engineering controls
          to control airborne levels.
