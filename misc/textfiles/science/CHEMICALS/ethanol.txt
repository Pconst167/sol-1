------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VENTILATION:             USE GENERAL OR LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION TO MEET
                         TLV REQUIREMENTS.

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION:  NONE REQUIRED WHERE ADEQUATE VENTILATION
                         CONDITIONS EXIST.  IF AIRBORNE CONCENTRATION IS
                         HIGH, A CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE RESPIRATOR WITH ORGANIC
                         VAPOR CARTRIDGE IS RECOMMENDED.  IF CONCENTRATION
                         EXCEEDS CAPACITY OF CARTRIDGE RESPIRATOR, A SELF-
                         CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS IS ADVISED.

EYE/SKIN PROTECTION:     SAFETY GOGGLES AND FACE SHIELD, UNIFORM,
                         PROTECTIVE SUIT, RUBBER GLOVES ARE RECOMMENDED.
