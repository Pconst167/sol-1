SWALLOWED. MAY CAUSE SEVERE EYE IRRITATION AND POSSIBLE INJURY. MAY
CAUSE LIVER AND KIDNEY DAMAGE. CAUSES SEVERE RESPIRATORY TRACT
IRRITATION. INHALATION OF FUMES MAY CAUSE METAL-FUME FEVER. EYE
CONTACT MAY RESULT IN PERMANENT EYE DAMAGE. MAY CAUSE SEVERE SKIN
IRRITATION. CAUSES SEVERE DIGESTIVE TRACT IRRITATION WITH PAIN,
NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. MAY CORRODE THE DIGESTIVE TRACT WITH
HEMORRHAGING AND POSSIBLE SHOCK.

Potential Health Effects
     Eye:
          Exposure to particulates or solution may cause conjunctivitis,
          ulceration, and corneal abnormalities.  Causes redness and pain.
     Skin:
          May cause skin sensitization, an allergic reaction, which becomes
          evident upon re-exposure to this material. Causes redness and pain.
          Skin contact can cause itching, redness, and an eczema-type rash.
     Ingestion:
          Harmful if swallowed. Causes gastrointestinal irritation with
          nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
     Inhalation:
          Causes severe irritation of upper respiratory tract with coughing,
          burns, breathing difficulty, and possible coma. Inhalation of fumes
          may cause metal fume fever, which is characterized by flu-like
          symptoms with metallic taste, fever, chills, cough, weakness, chest
          pain, muscle pain and increased white blood cell count.
     Chronic:
          Prolonged or repeated skin contact may cause dermatitis. May cause
          liver and kidney damage.
          Chronic toxicity related to copper is found only in individuals with
          Wilson's disease, who are unable to excrete copper. This causes
          retention of copper in the body resulting in damage to the liver,
          kidneys, brain, blood, bones and endocrine glands).


                    **** SECTION 4 - FIRST AID MEASURES ****

     Eyes:
          Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes,
          occasionally lifting the upper and lower lids. Get medical aid
          immediately.
     Skin:
          Get medical aid. Flush skin with plenty of soap and water for at
          least 15 minutes while removing contaminated clothing and shoes.
     Ingestion:
          Induce vomiting. If victim is conscious and alert, give 2-4 cupfuls
          of milk or water. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious
          person. Get medical aid immediately.
     Inhalation:
          Get medical aid immediately. Remove from exposure to fresh air
          immediately. If not breathing, give artificial respiration. If
          breathing is difficult, give oxygen.
     Notes to Physician:
          Treat symptomatically and supportively.
          Penicallamine may be of value as a chelating agent.

                 **** SECTION 10 - STABILITY AND REACTIVITY ****

     Chemical Stability:
          Stable. Stable under normal temperatures and pressures.
     Conditions to Avoid:
          Incompatible materials, acids, excess heat, temperatures above 65_C,
          exposure to moist air or water.
     Incompatibilities with Other Materials:
          Incompatible with hydrazine, nitromethane, and sodium hypobromite. A
