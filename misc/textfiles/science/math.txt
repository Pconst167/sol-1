    Warning - Some liquids and gases listed may be explosive
              under the right conditions. Many solids can
              catch fire and burn. Use CAUTION and GOOD COMMON SENSE.

    Note: Some books gave very different values for each substance so I
          have given you the highest and lowest values reported. The values
          will depend on the purity of the substance your using. If you
          know your substance is very pure then use the higher value
          reported. If you know your substance is contaminated or of poor
          quality then use the lower values reported. If you have unknown
          purity then use the average of the values given.

    =======================================================================
    EXPLAINATION OF EQUATIONS:

    Here are some real handy equations. They are very simple and easy to
    use.


    x = Multiply by
    / = divide by ( may also use line seperating terms above and below
        line as in standard mathematics).
    ( ) = Terms in parentheses should be calculated first as in standard
           algebraic equations.
     pi = 3.141592654. The circumferance of a circle divided by it's
          diameter will always give you this constant.

      2
    Z   = means the term "Z" multiplied by itself one time,"Z x Z".

    Note: In some cases I do not use the symbol "x" but instead simply
          put the terms close together, example: "LC" instead of "L x C".
          This is standard for algebraic equations and means "multiply by".

    =======================================================================
    MATH FOR TESLA COILS

    1. Determine your neon sign transformer (or other transformer's)
       Impedence:

                      E
               Z  =  ---
                      I

    Z = Impedence
    E = volts
    I = current in Amps
    Note: divide milliamps by 1000 to get Amps. 30 milliamps = .030 Amps.

    The Impedence of the primary capacitor should match the Impedence of the
    transformer at 60 Hz (60 Hz is the AC cycle rate of common household
    wall sockets, at least in America).

    2. To match Impedence and determine capacitor value:

                           1
             C =   -------------------
                   2 x pi x Z x .00006


     C = capacitance in microfarads needed for primary capacitor.
     Z = Impedence from equation one (Transformer Impedence)
    pi = 3.141592654
    Note: The .00006 is the 60 Hz AC, if you live outside the US then
          substitute your cycle rate.

    Next you need to find the Reactance of the primary capacitor at the
    frequency you have choosen. Many times the frequency is decided by the
    length of wire used on the secondary coil. See below for equations that
    determine frequency by length of wire used on secondary.
    When we find the Reactance , we can then find your needed Inductance
    for the Primary coil.

    3. To determine Reactance of capacitor:

                        1
            X(C) = ---------------
                   2 x pi x C x F

     X(C) = capacitor Reactance
        C = Capacitor value in microfarads, from equation 2)
        F = Frequency in Mhz (megahertz)
       pi = 3.141592654
     Note: To convert kilohertz to megahertz simply divide by 1000.
           190 Khz = .190 Mhz

     4. To determine the Inductance needed for Primary coil:

        Set X(L) = X(C)

                     X(L)
              L = ------------
                  2 x pi x F

       L = Inductance in microhenries needed for Primary Coil.
           To get millihenries divide the answer by 1000.
    X(L) = Reactance from equation 3, same as X(C).
       F = frequency in Megahertz.  Divide Khz by 1000 to get Mhz.
      pi = 3.141592654

    Now you know the values for your capacitor and primary coil. These
    values will give you the best ringing for your circuit (ie. more bang
    for your buck)! Use the equations below to finnish the project.

    Note: Many people don't go to the trouble to work these equations out.
    They simply slap the parts together and then try to tune. If you work
    the equations out first you will save lots of time in tuning, you will
    at least be in the right ball park! Also, just because you worked it
    out on paper that doesn't mean it will work the first time you plug it
    in. Trial and error is a large part of the Tesla Coil hobby!

    Maximum voltage rating will be equal to the voltage rating of the
    lowest voltage capacitor of the group.

    Capacitance = 1 / --- + --- + ---, etc...
                      C1    C2    C3

    The total capacitance of several capacitors in series will always be
    LESS than that of the smallest capacitor.

    Total voltage rating increases with number of capacitors in series.
    Simply add the voltage ratings together.
    When capacitors are placed in series to increase voltage rating they
    should have the same capacitance and voltage rating else voltages will
    divide unevenly, most likely causing failure.

    Most common material is Aluminum Roof Flashing. Use plastic bolts to
    hold sections of strips together if you have short pieces of ribbon.
    This makes a good mechanical connection (you can't solder aluminum).

    EQUATION 10: POWER FACTOR CORRECTION FOR NEON SIGN TRANSFORMERS

    Neons typically have an efficiency of about 50%, in that they
    draw twice as much power as they put out. This problem can be
    resolved with the use of power factor correction (pfc) capaci-
    tance across the line. The pfc capacitors used are the same as
    for capacitor starting motors. The voltage rating should be at
    least twice the line current used, and I like a 4x voltage margin
    for long life. The formula used to determine ballpark pfc is as
    follows:
                                    9
                                  10^
              C = Corrected kVA  ------ 2
                                 2(pi)fe^

    This should read C = Corrected kVA times (10 to the ninth power)
                         over, (2 pi times f times e squared)

    C = required capacitance in microfarads
    f = frequency of applied voltage
    e = applied voltage

    CORRECTED KVA is determined by dividing the volt*amps (watts)
    output of the neon sign xfrmr by 1000

   NST = Neon Sign Transformer, 110 volts primary, 15,000 volt secondary
         at 30-60 miliamps.
    SG = Safty Gap. A spark gap to insure your transformer doesn't get fried.
    SC = Safty Capacitor. 300-500 picofarad rated at 50 KV.
   FCC = Ferrite Core Choke. This prevents real high voltages from coming
         back towards your transformer. It also seperates the capacitors.
   PC  = Primary Capacitor. Normally .01-.02 microfarads rated 50 KV.
   SG  = Spark Gap.
   P-COIL = Primary Coil.
   S-Coil = Secondary Coil.
   TC  =  Terminal Capacitor. The big ball or coffee can on top.
   Gnd = Ground.

          happen to use.

    =======================================================================
    WARNING:

    Only people who are experienced with High Voltage devices should
    attempt to build Tesla Coils. They can be very deadly if you don't
    know what your doing. Remember, if they find you on the floor
    turning blue and frothing at the mouth - THERE IS NO SECOND CHANCE!

    A FEW Safety Tips:

    1. Don't ever touch the machine when it is pluged in.
    2. Use a safe methode to short out the primary capacitor after the
       machine has been run.
    3. Don't ever get close to a running Tesla coil, the Primary can
       shoot hot white arcs at you that will kill you instantly!
    4. Always have a small fire extinguisher close by.
    5. Always use kickback preventer circuits so you don't send
       15,000 volts back through the wall!
    6. Pets, children, and irresponsible adults should be kept away from
       your machine intirely!!!
    7. Read many books on Tesla Coils and other High Voltage devices
       and learn as much as you can about High Voltage Safety!
    8. Review the FIDO text files compiled by Richard T. Quick II

    I wrote this file because I felt there was a need for some real
    information for those of us who actually build Tesla Coils, as opposed
    to those who just talk of building them (Grin). I will be adding to this
    file from time to time, so watch for updates. I hope it helps you out!

    P.S. Let us not forget the words of Tesla," Let the future tell the
    truth and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments.
    The present is theirs, the future, for which I really worked, is mine".
