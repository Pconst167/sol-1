                 Computerized EEG Analysis of Subjects Undergoing
                        Synchro-Energization for Relaxation

                     experiments and presentation prepared by
              Sandra G. Loychik, Carroll P. Osgood, Bart C. Hayford,
                       James P.  Burke and Dennis E. Hainsey

       Computerized EEG signals  were  used  to  evaluate  the  effects  of
       "Synchro-Energizer" stimulation.   Synchro-Energizer  (S-E)  devices
       are the newest craze in stress reduction.

       The S-E device  includes  dark  goggles  with  tiny  lights  inside,
       earphones and a  control  module  that  varies  the  light and sound
       sequence.  S-E salons are springing up around metropolitan areas and
       are enjoying a lot of media attention.

       Power Spectra were obtained for the standard frequency bands (delta,
       theta, alpha and beta); activity  in  microvolts  for  each band was
       measured before, during and after a twenty minute session on the S-E
       device.

       Although the S-E  device  is  ALLEGED to induce a mental  relaxation
       response, we found  no  statistical evidence supporting existence of
       LASTING relaxation-type changes, i.e.  NO INCREASE in alpha or theta
       range activity, in  the  EEG  of  thirty  young, healthy  volunteers
       thirty minutes POST S-E use.
