According to Ref.1 and others, it is not possible to create
mechanical momentum from enclosed electromagnetic energy only :
'For it is an obvious postulate that in stationary state in which
matter is at rest and in which there are no waves escaping, there
can be no electromagnetic momentum'.

Still, this should be possible, and simpler than originally
thought of :

Suppose a Helmholtz coils arrangement, i.e. two flat coils,
separated a distance approximately equal to the radius of a coil.

If an alternating current is applied on each coil, an
electromagnetic field will be generated by each one. So, an
attraction and repulsion effect will appear at the frequency of
the applied currents and fields, on each coil, due to the field
generated by the other coil.

Now, the question arises: is it possible that, instead of the
coils attracting and repelling each other, both will experiment a
force in the same direction? In other words: if you mount them
on a cart, will the cart move in one direction ?

Apparently it is possible after all, at least theoretically,
because it is not the current but the FIELD generated by the
said current that reacts with the other coil, and, since it takes
a certain amount of time for the field to cross the space between
the coils, it is just a matter of finding an arrangement that
will create a unidirectional force condition.

Is there such a force condition ? Yes, and it is very simple :

If, (a) the frequency is sufficiently high so that the distance
'D' between the coils will be a quarter of a wavelength, (b) both
fields are of the same frequency, and (c) are in phase when they
meet at one coil (they will be in opposite phase when they reach
the second coil), then, a force will appear alternating on each
coil but this force will always point in the same direction,
since, one of the coils (the leading one) will always be 'pushed'
by the field of the lagging one, which in turn will always be
'pulled' by the leading coil field.

For clarity, see the following chart that corresponds to the
schematic further down :


     | FIELD | FIELD | FIELD | FIELD | DIREC. | FORCE
 Time| COIL1 | COIL1 | COIL2 | COIL2 |   OF   |  ON
     | POS.1 | POS.2 | POS.1 | POS.2 | FORCE  | COIL #
-------------------------------------------------------
     |       |       |       |       |        |
  0  |  MAX  |       |       |   0   |        |
     |       |       |       |       |        |
 D/C |   0   |  MAX  |   0   |  MAX  |    +   |    2
     |       |       |       |       |        |
2D/C |  MIN  |   0   |  MAX  |   0   |    +   |    1
     |       |       |       |       |        |
3D/C |   0   |  MIN  |   0   |  MIN  |    +   |    2

and so on ...

 C   : speed of the magnetic vector

 D/C : quarter-wavelength travel time.

Now, to avoid electromagnetic radiation the assembly CAN BE
ENCLOSED. The enclosure will also affect the wavelength and
force, depending on the particular shape and quality of the
enclosure. But this also means that the electromagnetic energy is
not radiated (other than termal losses) and CAN BE RECIRCULATED
i.e. an 'electromagnetic wheeling' effect.

This arrangement is similar to a directional coupler in microwave
technology, in which the electromagnetic energy propagates in one
direction only.

If the energy can propagate in one direction only in a closed
waveguide, then both ends of the waveguide can be joined in a
ring-shape, and consequently angular mechanical momentum can be
generated at will.

Obviously:

             (a) Any two electromagnetic sources, out-of-phase
                 in time and space will give you this effect.
                 The force will be maximum when the sources are
                 a quarter of a wavelength appart, in space and
                 time.

             (b) It can be enclosed in a metal box of any shape,
                 something very similar to a resonant cavity,
                 which in turn SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE.

             (c) When the fields are in-phase there is no
                 resultant force but an increase in
                 electromagnetic mass !


As far as the calculations go, here is some preliminary:

          coil1                  coil2
------------|----------------------|------------------------> x
           x=0                    x=c/4f


 c =  field propagation velocity
 f =  field frequency


coil 1 :             H1 = I1 sin wt

coil 2 :             H2 = I2 cos wt
                          ___
distance :         c/4f = // /2   ; i.e. quarter-wavelength

                                        ___
Field H1 at coil 2:  H12 = I1 sin (wt - // /2) = I1 (-cos wt)

                                                      2
Force at coil 2      F2 = u H12 * H2  = - u I1 I2  cos wt

This expression says that coil2 will always feel attracted, or
pulled by coil 1.

                                                    ___
           Field H2 at coil 1:  H21 = - I2 cos(wt - // /2)  = -I2 sin wt

           is negative because it travels in the opposite
           direction.

                                                                 2
           Force at coil 1 :     F1 = u H1 * H21 = - u  I1 I2 sin wt

I.e.: coil1 always feels repelled, or pushed, by coil2.

Ergo, a unidirectional force !

To concentrate the field and avoid magnetic lines dispersion, a
core or nucleus of magnetic material can be used to improve the
force effect. The magnetic material will then slow down the
propagation of the magnetic field waves, therefore allowing to
decrease, either the frequency or the distance between coils.
This core behaves very much like a 'resonant cavity' also.

For enclosed electromagnetic fields, the electromagnetic force
equation in integral form can be used (Ref.2).

The magnitude of the forces involved is very small, therefore it
is difficult to set up an experiment that will demonstrate the
principle, since very high frequencies and fields are necessary.

For two coils mounted on a ferrite antenna core, with a relative
permeability of 10, separated 6 cm, 28.2 ampturn at 395 MHZ and
156 ohms/turn are needed to generate 1 Newton ! This is 124 kVA !
plus losses.

But, according to the 'Principle of Equivalence' if it is
possible to create a force, in space, from enclosed
electromagnetic energy only, it should be possible to create the
inverse, i.e. electromagnetic energy from a 'force field'.

In a previous work by this author (Ref.3), it was suggested that
the 'electromagnetic momentum density' was the (missing) link
between mechanics and electrodynamics. This would suggest in
turn, that gravitation is nothing else than 'phase waves',
similar to the ones that develop in microwave guides and resonant
cavities. But for 'phase waves' to exist, there  must be an
electromagnetic field of that frequency present already.

This, in turn, brings back the concept of 'ether', and that all
mass, and even the whole universe is probably nothing else but a
gigantic 'resonant cavity'. A very powerful concept.

In (4) it is claimed, that an experiment has been set-up that can
measure absolute velocities, and explains why the Michelson-
Morley experiment fails to do so. This, in turn, would be
complementary proof of the above, the existence of an 'ether'.
