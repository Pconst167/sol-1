                            CONFIDENTIAL RIFE REPORT
                                       By
                               Lyks Sieger, M.D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRETEND FOR A MOMENT THAT YOU HAVE JUST DISCOVERED A REMARKABLE NEW THERAPY
WHICH CAN ERADICATE ANY DISEASE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Surely the medical world will reserve its highest awards for you. But such was
not the case for Semmelweiss, when he struggled to convince surgeons to practice
sterile procedures. Nor for Pasteur, ridiculed for years for the germ theory.
Other visionaries who went through the Inquisition for breaking new ground
include Roentgen and his X-rays, Morton and his ether anaesthesia, Harvey and
his theory of blood circulation, and others.  It does seem that orthodox
medicine resents those who challenge its cherished beliefs. And too often, the
pioneer pays a price for such blasphemy.
    Well, certainly the research foundations would welcome news of your
astounding discovery.  Won't they all be thrilled to learn you have a cure for
the very same diseases they are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars per
year to investigate? Maybe not, if it means the end of the gravy train. Forget
the research foundations.
    So far, you and your amazing cure are not very popular.  Why not take it to
the pharmaceutical industry? Surely they would be interested. But remember: you
have a universal cure... it makes all other drugs obsolete.  The pharmaceutical
industry may be somewhat less then thrilled.  They may even see to it that your
cure never gets licensed by the regulatory agencies, whose incestuous relation
with drug companies were well chronicled by the regular press in 1989.
   Now assume that your amazing cure is electronic instrument. The only cost of
using it is electricity.  And it's totally harmless to patients, who can recover
without losing their hair or bankrupting their families.  So why would anyone
continue to pay up to $200,000 per patient -- to become deathly ill with
chemotherapy, radiation and surgery?  You haven't won any friends among the
oncologists, radiologists and surgeons.
    You could try the hospitals and big clinics.  But how  excited are they
going to be about a therapy administered in any doctor's office which reversers
illness before the patient has to be hospitalized?  Thanks to you and your
miracle, the staff will be spending their time playing Video game with the
billing computers, sinking putts into urine cups and waiting for someone to
break a leg.
   Then how about the insurance companies?  Surely they would be delighted to
save the expense of hospitalation.  At least the companies which haven't
invested in hospitals. And the ones who don't lose policyholders as a result.
And the companies which aren't trying to divest themselves of their
pharmaceutical stock. On second thought, forget the insurance compies.
    Do you still think your cure will be a big hit with the orthodox medical
worid?
   Probably the only friends you'll have will be patients and those progressive
doctors who see change as an opportunitt, father than a threat to old ways.
They'll love you.
   What follows is the story of just such a sensational therapy, and what
happened to it.   In one of the blackest episodes in history, this remarkable
electronic therapy was sabotaged and buried by a sinister group of men.  It has
re-emerged publicly only since 1986.  This is the story of Royal Rife and his
electronic instruments.    If you have never heard about Rife before, you'll be scandalized and
incredulous.  But I urge you to reserve judgment until you read the entire story
that follows.
    Of course, some may regard this as just an amusing piece of fiction.  For
those who are willing to investigate it, I'll refer to highly-respected medical
doctors who worked with Rife, and briefly describe the technical aspects (those
who are bored by technical details have permission to skip to the end).  Also,
you may wish to read some of the books on Rife's therapy published since 1986
for further details.
  But in the final analysis, the best way to know if such a remarkable therapy
actually exists is to experience it firsthand.  Not just another rigged double-
blind trial, whose conclusion is dictated in advance by vested interests.  But
an honest trial, conducted by the one person who has nothing to lose by learning
the truth:  yourself.  If regulatory and licensing restrictions are observed, it
is your privilege to examine this therapy and use it under appropriate
guidelines, as described at the end of this report.
  To return to our thrilling story of yesteryear, who was Royal Rife?  And why
haven't we heard about him before?
   Royal Rife was a brilliant scientist born in 1888, who died in 1971.  After
studying at Johns Hopkins, Rife developed technology commonly used today in
optics, analytical chemistry, radiochemistry, electronics, biochemistry,
ballistics, and aviation.  It could be said that Rife practically developed
electromedicine himself.  He received 14 awards plus an honorary doctorate from
the University of Heidelberg for his work.  In the 66 years that Rife spent
designing and building medical instruments, Rife worked for Zeiss Optics, the
U.S. Government, and private benefactors such as millionaire Henry Timken.
   Because Rife was self-educated in many fields, he acquired the habit of
looking beyond tradition and dogma for his answers.  He mastered so many
disciplines that his mind contained the skills and knowledge of an entire team
of scientists and technicians of different persuasions.
   So whenever technology didn't exist to perform a new task, Rife simply
invented and built it himself:  a heterodyning ultraviolet microscope; a
microdissector; a micromanipulator.  When you finish reading his report, you may
agree that Rife was probably the most gifted, versatile scientific mind in the
history of mankind.
   By 1920, Rife had built the first virus microscope.  By 1933 it had evolved
into the incredibly complex Universal Microscope--with nearly SIX THOUSAND
parts, capable of enlarging microbes 60,000 times.  With such tools, Rife became
the first man on earth to see a virus.  And until just recently, this was the
only microscope which could observe the live action of viruses.  Modern electron
microscopes still instantly kill everything beneath them, viewing only the
mummified remains and debris.  What the Rife microscope can see is the bustling
activity of viruses as they change form to accommodate changes in environment,
replicate rapidly in response to carcinogens, and transform normal cells into
tumor cells.
    But how was Rife able to accomplish this, in as age when electronics and
medicine were still just evolving?  Now for a few technical details to satisfy
the skeptics.
    Rife painstakingly identified the individual spectroscopic signature of each
microbe, using a slit spectroscope attachment.  Then he slowly rotated block
quartz prisms so as to focus light of a single wavelength upon the
microorganism.  This wave was singled out because it _resonated_ with the
spectroscopic signature of the microbe based on the now established fact that
every molecule oscillated at its own distinct frequency.  Thus, no two species
have the same oscillations for energetic signature.   The result of using a resonant wavelength is that micro-organisms which are
invisible in white light suddenly become visible, in a brilliant flash of light,
in the color that resonated with their distinct spectroscopic signature.  These
organisms were visible actively invading tissues even in diseases whose origin
is obscure, as the connective tissue diseases.  So Rife could see organisms that
no one else could find with ordinary microscopes.  (See books by other authors
for technical details)
   More than 75% of the organisms Rife could observe with the Universal
Microscope are only visible with ultra-violet light.  But ultraviolet light is
outside the range of human vision.  Rife overcame this limitation by
heterodyning (a technique which became popular in early radio broadcasting).  He
illuminated the microbe with two different wavelengths of ultraviolet light
which resonated with the spectral signature of the microbe.  These two waves
produced interference where they merged.  And this interference was, in effect,
a third, longer wave which fell into the visible portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum.  So once again, Rife made invisible microbes visible, _without_
killing them.  This breached another barrier which is still insurmountable even
for electron microscopes.
    By now, Rife was so far ahead of his colleagues of the 1930s, that they
could not follow what he was doing without coming to San Diego to look through
his Virus Microscopes.  And many did exactly that.
    One was Virinia Livingstion.  She eventually moved from New Jersey to his
Point Loma (San Diego) neighborhood, and became a frequent visitor to his lab.
Virginia Livington is generally given credit for identifying the organism which
causes human cancer, beginning with papers she published in 1948.
   However Rife had identified the human cancer virus first--in 1920.  He then
made TWENTY THOUSAND unsuccessful attempts to transform normal cells into tumor
cells.  He finally succeeded when he irradiated the virus, passed it through a
cell-catching filter, and injected it into animals.  Not content to prove this
virus caused one tumor, Rife then created _four hundred tumors in succession_
with this technique (documenting it all with film, photos and meticulous
records).  He named his cancer virus "Cryptocides primordiales".  Virginia
Livingston, in her papers, renamed it "Progenitor cryptocides".  Rife was never
even mentioned in these papers.
    He seldom got credit for his discoveries.  He was a quiet, unassuming
scientist; dedicated to expanding his discoveries rather than to ambition, fame
and glory.  His distaste for medical politics (which he could afford to ignore,
thanks to generous trusts set up by private benefactors) left him at a
disadvantage later, when the forces of evil attacked him.  Coupled with the
influence of the pharmaceutical industry in purging his papers from medical
journals, it is hardly surprising that few have heard of Rife.
   Meanwhile, debate raged between those who had seen viruses changing into
different forms beneath Rife's microscopes, and those who had not.  Those who
condemned without investigation----such as the influential Dr. Thomas Rivers---
claimed these forms didn't exist.  Because his microscope did not reveal them,
Rivers argued that there was "no logical basis for belief in this theory".  The
same argument is used today in evaluation many other "alternative" medical
treatments:  if there is no precedent, then it must not be valid.  Nothing can
convince a closed mind.  Most had never actually looked through the San Diego
microscopes--air travel in the 1930s was uncomfortable, primitive, and rather
risky.  So the debate about the life cycle of viruses was resolved in favor of
those who never saw it.  (Even modern electron microscopes can not show the
transformation from one form into another--only frozen images).
    Nevertheless, many scientists and doctors have since confirmed Rife's
discovery fo the cancer virus and its pleomorphic nature, using darkfieldtechniques, the Naessens microscope, and laboratory experiments.  Rife also
worked with the top scientists and doctors of his day, who of course also
confirmed or endorsed various areas of his work. Rife himself ignored the
debate, preferring to concentrate on refining his method of destroying these
tiny killer viruses.
   He used the same principle to kill them which made them visible:  resonance.
By increasing the intensity of a frequency which resonated naturally with these
microbes, Rife increased their natural oscillations unit they distorted and
disintegrated from structural stresses.  This frequency was the "MOR", or mortal
oscillatory rate.  It cannot harm anything but the microbe.  (Frequencies shown
on modern Rife instruments are longer wave fundamentals of the frequencies
actually used for this).
    This principle can be illustrated by using an intense musical note to
shatter a wine glass:  the molecules of the glass are already oscillating at
some harmonic (multiple) of that musical note; they are in resonance with it.
Because everything else has a different resonant frequency, _nothing but the
glass_ is destroyed.  Hundreds of trillions of different resonant frequencies
exist; each species has its own.
   It took Rife many years, working 48 hours at a time, until he discovered
frequencies which specifically destroyed herpes, polio, spinal meningitis,
tetanus, flu, and a immense number ot other dangerous diseases.  I have observed
_only one_ less-than-dramatic response in dozens of serious cases.  However even
if the symptoms vanish after one treatment, therapy must be repeated for awhile
to prevent a relapse.
   The possibilities of using frequencies to eliminate human suffering indeed
seems infinite.  Today, doctors are even seeing results in conditions of unknown
origin, such as cataracts, diabetes, and diseases of connective tissue.  Perhaps
these conditions are in fact caused by microbes which are invisible to  ordinary
microscopes, unless ultraviolet or resonant wavelengths are used to illuminate
them.  Of course, proper equipment and technique are required to destroy the
microbes.  Frequency-type generators, simply do _not_ get adequate results
unless they are correctly modified.
   In 1934, the University of Southern California appointed a Special Medical
Research Committee to bring terminal cancer patients from Pasadena County
Hospital to Rife's San Diego laboratory and clinic for treatment.  The team
included doctors and pathologists assigned to examine the patients, if still
alive, in 90 days.  At this time, the Committee concluded that 86.5% of the
patients had been---to used their phrase---"completely cured".  Then the
treatment was adjusted, and the remaining patients also recovered in less than
four weeks.  The total recovery rate was 100%.  I sincerely doubt that any other
therapy could ever approach this rate of success.

Note:  even a 100% cure rate is not the final answer.  Even a therapy that kills
100% of the microbes may not prevent a relapse due to repopulation from the
environment at a later date.  Because microbes, like animal predators, only
attack the week.  To return the cells to vigor, it can be immensely helpful to
use a raw food diet such as the Gerson or Wigmore therapy.  Such a diet is free
of the denatured molecules of cooked food which gradually clog call machinery
and reduce ts functioning.
    But how long can _you_ eat only raw food?  Furthermore, in the case of a
chronic condition that has eroded the immune system and other organs. a raw food
diet will usually be too little, and too late to overcome the overwhelming
advantage the microbes now have.
    For everyone who thinks he might have cancer one day--and 40% of us
eventually will have--Rife's frequency treatment is the one method found to bealmost a guarantee of survival.  _Providing_ the correct procedure, frequency,
and instrument is used, I have never seen Rife's frequencies fail in cases
involving micro-organisms.  I have also seen dramatic changes in cases which are
not known to be caused by microbes.  Perhaps they are caused by microbes not
visible with ordinary microscopes.
    On Nov. 20, 1931, forty-four of the nation's most respected medical
authorities honored Rife with a banquet billed as "The End to All Disease".
They were photographed with Rife at the Pasadena estate of Dr. Milbank Johnson.
But by 1939, almost all of them were denying they had ever met Rife.  What
happened to make so many brilliant men have memory lapses?  Was is an epidemic
of occasional Alzheimer's Disease?
    It seems that news of Rife's miracles with terminal patients had reached
other ears.  Remember our hypothetical question at the beginning of this report:
what would happen if you discovered a cure for everything?  You are about to
find out.
    At first, a token attempt was made to buy out Rife.  Morris Fishbein, who
had acquired the entire stock of the American Medical Association by 1934, sent
a attorney to Rife with an "offer you can't refuse".  And Rife refused.
   We may never know the exact terms of this offer.  But we do know the terms of
the offer Fishbein made to Harry Hoxsey for control of his herbal cancer remedy.
Fishbein's associates would receive all profits for nine years, and Hoxsey would
receive nothing.  Then, if they were satisfied that it worked, Hoxsey would
begin to get 10% of the profits.  Hoxsey decided he'd rather just continue to
make all the profits himself.  When Hoxsey turned Fishbein down, Fishbein used
his immensely powerful political connections to have Hoxsey arrested 125 times
in 16 months.  Although the charges (based on practice without a licence) were
always thrown out of court the harassment drove Hoxsey crazy.  At one time he
was arrested once ever 3 days.
   But Fishbein must have realized that this strategy would backfire if used on
Rife.  After all, arresting Rife would mean that testimony supporting Rife would
be introduced by prominent medical authorities working with Rife.  And the
defense would undoubtedly take the opportunity to introduce evidence such as the
1934 medical study.  The last thing in the world that the pharmaceutical
industry wanted was a public trial about a painless therapy that cured 100% of
the patients in the 1934 study and cost nothing to use but electricity.  It
might give people the idea they didn't need drugs.  And finally, Rife had spent
decades accumulating meticulous evidence of his work, including film and stop-
motion photographs.  No, different tactics--not necessarily fair or legal--were
called for.
   The first incident was the gradual plifering fo components, photographs,
film, and written records from Rife's lab.   At one time, Rife employed 125
assistants; the culprit was never caught.  Then, while Rife struggled to
reproduce his missing data, in a day when photocopies and computers were not
available, someone vandalized his precious virus microscopes.  Pieces of te
5,682 piece Universal microscope were stolen.  Earlier, arson had destroyed the
multi-million dollar Burnett Lab in New Jersey, just as they prepared to
announce confirmation of Rife's work.  But the final blow came later, when
police illegally confiscated the remainder of Rife's 50 years of research.
   Then in 1939, agents of a family which controlled 85% of the drug industry
assisted Philip Hoyland, in a frivolous lawsuit against his own partners in Beam
Ray Corp.  This was the only company manufacturing Rife's frequency instruments
(Rife was not a partner).  Although Hoyland lost the case, it achieved the
desired effect:  the company was bankrupted by legal expenses.  And during the
great Depression, this meant that commercial production of Rife's frequency
instruments ceased entirely.   And remember what a universal cure meant to hospitals and research
foundations?   Any doctor found working with Rife immediately lost all hospital
privileges and foundation grants.  No one who had anything to say about Rife's
therapy could get a paper published in any medical journal.  Association with
rife became professional suicide.
   On the other hand, big money was spent ensuring that doctors who had seen
Rife's therapy would forget what they saw.  Almost no price was too much to
suppress it:  remember that today, treatment of a single cancer patient costs
about $200,000.  It's big business.  And thus Arthur Kendall, the medical school
director who worked with rife on the cancer virus, accepted almost a quarter of
a million dollars to suddenly "retire" in Mexico.  That was an absured amount of
money in the Depression.  As for Dr. George Dock, another prominent figure, he
was silenced with an enormous grant and the highest honors the A.M.A. could
award.
   Between the carrots and sticks, everyone except Dr. Couche and Dr. Johnson
gave up Rife's work.  Dr. Johnson died from an injection of poison during a
routine tonsillectomy on Oct. 3, 1944.  He was about to announce that the USC
medical committee had agreed that all patients treated with Rife's Instruments
had recovered from terminal illnesses.  His research reports and the USC study
disappeared the night of his death.  This had a sobering effect on the other
doctors.
   To finish the job, the medical journals, supported almost entirely by drug
company advertising, refused to publish any paper by anyone on Rife's therapy.
Thus an entire generation of medical students graduated into practice, without
ever once hearing of Rife's breakthroughs in medicine.
   The magnitude of such an insane crime eclipses every mass murder in history.
Cancer picks us off silently, but by 1960 the casualties from this tiny virus
exceeded the carnage of all the wars we American ever fought.  I 1989, it was
estimated that 40% of us will experience cancer at some time in our lives.
    In Rife's lifetime, e had witnessed the progress of civilization from horse-
and-buggy travel to jet planes.  In that same time, he saw the epidemic of
cancer increase from 1 in 24 Americans (1905) to one in three (1971).
    He also witnessed the phenomenal growth of the American Cancer Society, the
Salk Foundation, and many others collecting hundred of millions of dollars, for
diseases cured long ago in his own San Diego laboratories.  In one period,
176,500 cancer drugs were submitted for approval, ad any which showed favorable
results in _one-sixth of one per cent_ of the cases studied could be licensed.
Some of these drugs had a mortality rate of 14 to 17%.  When death came from the
drug, not the cancer, the case was reported as a "complete" or "partial
remission". because the patient didn't actually die from cancer.  It was a race
to see which would kill the patient first:  the drug or te disease.  But it was
a financial success.  Cancer became a multi-billion dollar industry, actually
employing more people than the sick!
   The inevitable concision reached by Rife was that his life-long labor and
discoveries had not only been ignored, but probably would be buried with him.
At that point, he ceased to produce much of anything, and spent the last third
of his life seeking oblivion in alcohol.  They dulled his acute awareness of so
much unnecessary suffering for the profit of a few, and half a century of wasted
research.  Today, doctors would be telling millions of patients, "Relax, it's
only cancer. In a few months, you'll be as good as new."
   Fortunately, his death was not the end electronic therapy.  A dozen or so
humanitarian doctors and engineers reconstructed his frequency instrument, and
kept the therapy alive.  Finally it became public again in 1986, with the
publication of books which told Rife's store.    A deluge of public and professional interest resulted.  Today, at least a
dozen manufacturers are supplying the demand for Rife's frequency instruments,
now known as _Rife Generators_.  But as stated previously, the interests.  In
1989, journalists linked the pharmaceutical industry with routine bribery of
regulatory agency officials.  Through their influence, Three Rife manufacturers
were shut down last year on the ground that claims made during monitored
telephone conversations had not been approved.  No one know how long it will be
possible to obtain Rife Generator, before past events are repeated.
   Thanks to mass-produced components, modern Rife Generators are considerably
less expensive then the $7,000 broadcasting tube instruments built at one time
by Rife and Lee de Forest (this was the actual production cost; a fortune during
the Depression).  It is now possible to obtain a good one for about what a good
stereo system costs.  There is tremendous variation in the cost and design of
the modern Rife Generator.  Where can the average person go for information? His
doctor won't know.  The reader may not be knowledgable about the features of the
Rife Generators.  It is possible to spend a lot of money for an instrument which
does not perform any better then a model that costs a third as much.  And some
models have undesirable limitations in range and power.
    For this reason I wrote "The Consumer Guide to The Rife Generators" with Dr.
Reisdorf, revised 1990.  While this guide does not specifically recommend any
particular brand, there is adequate information for you to find the model that
suit your needs.
