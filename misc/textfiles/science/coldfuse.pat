"Apparatus for cold nuclear fusion".
** Prepared by a German representative (patent lawyer?), this
incredibly badly written patent application claims a number of
"preferred embodiments" for cold fusion. One is electrolysis at a
cathode of an alloy capable of occluding hydrogen isotopes, such
as Ti, Zr, and the like, in an electrolyte containing a compound
of hydrogen isotope and oxygen such as heavy water including
alkali metal ions such as Li+, K+ and the like. "Tritiums",
"noutrons" may be produced by making use of "lithiums" and by the
"tonnel" effect. There is a list of example alloys for use as
cathode, all having larger hydrogen occlusion ability than "Pb"
and the like. An example shows that at the end of an
electrolysis, 5 times the starting concentration of T is found,
proving that cold fusion had taken place. Also, 500 neutrons of
2.45 MeV were detected or 10 times the background. In the second
preferred embodiment, some amorphous alloys are used, not having
"a crystal lattice rule of a long period", meaning (presumably)
no long-range order. Some of these appear to have a rather high
hydrogen uptake. Crumbling was never observed and again, excess
tritiums are seen. The third embodiment uses a large (7 mm
diameter) spherical cathode. In this way, the collision
probability for deuterons is enhanced in the centre of the
electrode and in this way, the nuclear fusion reaction was caused
easily and an enormous energy was obtained (I am quoting). Two to
ten times the background neutron count was detected in an
example. In another example, two spherical alloy samples were
charged with D2 gas, and then a high-frequency discharge passed
between them. Neutrons at 1000 times the background was observed;
using pure H2, the neutron flux was the same as the background.
Temperature cycling was also tried, and neutrons detected.

"Fusion apparatus".
** "Fusion apparatuses for coupling fusible material to a
quantized mode in coherent fusion are provided. Method for
optimization of reactor operation, control of the coherent fusion
reaction and extraction of usable energy generated are provided".
Some of the means of doing this are: containing the fusible
material (deuterium) in an electrically conductive radially
symmetric vessel and initiating fusion through coupling to
plasmon modes or by radially polarizing insulating crystals, or
by lining the vessel with radially disposed rod-like projections
electrically connected in series with an oscillator and in series
with a computer controlled variable load for extracting the
energy; acoustic excitation or excitement by alpha particles or
cosmic rays. The inventor's theory is given (twice), p.48 shows a
letter to Florence and Sam and there are 138 claims.

"Verfahren und Anordnung zu Kernverschmelzungsreaktionen bei
tiefen Temperaturen" (Method and apparatus for nuclear fusion
reactions at low temperatures).
** Professors Hora and Miley (editor of Fusion Technology) write
that the electrolytic charging of Pd or Ti with deuterium leads
to surface contamination. This is avoided by charging with
deuterium gas under pressure, which is one of their inventions
here laid bare. The 9 claims widen this concept to include any
metallic element in "the eighth group of the periodic table"
being exposed to H2, D2 or T2 gas, temperature control during
such a process, absorption of neutrons, alpha or beta emission,
the admixture of such isotopes as (11)B, (6)Li and (7)Li to the
metals, attainment of high hydrogen isotope concentration in the
metal, the use of electric discharge towards this end, the use of
high-surface forms of the metals or mixtures thereof, control of
the metal hydrides' compressibility and finally, the use of these
processes for initiating an explosive nuclear fission [sic]
reaction. Since this is an Offenlegungsschrift and not (yet) a
full patent, no details are given of how all this is implemented.

"Process and apparatus for the uptake of hydrogen in a solid".
** Expressed very generally, this invention is about the uptake of hydrogen
isotopes in a solid that is capable of taking it up. This could be, for
example, a palladium cathode in a cold fusion arrangement, or a hydrogen
storage material in a vehicle. The essence of the invention is to solve the
problem of an active layer, that enables hydrogen uptake; such a layer is here
generated continuously by means of, e.g., a dilute palladium salt in the
electrolyte (causing Pd deposition in a spongy, active form), or by means of
surface radiation treatment of the material. Various other means are covered.

"Energy production by nuclear fusion".
** "In this process, in which a fusible material is absorbed in the crystal
lattice of a H-absorbing material that has a neg. elec. polarity, the fusible
material is, or is being, absorbed by a H-absorbing material in the form of
individual particles having a neg. electrostatic charge, after which the
polarity of the particles is changed from neg. to pos. This process is esp.
aimed at the controlled fusion of D, optionally mixed with T, in the crystal
lattice of the H-absorbing material, at high efficiency. The H-absorbing
material is a metal or alloy consisting of, or contg., >=1 element selected
from, Pd, Ti, Zr, V, Th, Nb, Ta, Ni and Fe. A turbulent aerosol or suspension
of colloidal or cryst. particles (av. particle size 0.1-0.001 mu) in D is
supplied in an upflow through a vertical quartz tube internally coated with an
elec. conductive coating or metal foil, e.g., Al or Cu, connected to the neg.
electrode of a d.c. source. A cooled pos. charged plate (anode) is located
above the tube, the polarity of the particles contg. the absorbed D is changed
upon contact with the anode, and the pos. ions, e.g. triton, formed by nuclear
fusion are then expelled from the Pd particles. The ions then flow downwards,
are neutralised at the cathode in the conical bottom of the reactor, and the
Pd particles are then sepd. from the aerosol in, e.g., a hydrocyclone. The Pd
particles may be elec. charged in an insulating oil, e.g. a silicone oil. The
heat generated by the fusion is removed by the heat transfer medium with which
the anode is cooled". (Direct quote from CA).

** First, a metal must be used that can absorb deuterium to high
concentrations; then, the deuterium's harmonic oscillation energy in the metal
must be raised, preferably "by discharge of deuterium gas, optical irradiation

are subjected to pulsed voltages to induce gas charge and discharge, so as to
enhance cold fusion.

"Plasma nuclear fusion method".
** This patent sets out to solve several problems with "conventional" cold
fusion apparati and thereby give us reliable cold fusion. These problems are:
a) the use of "solusion", allowing little chance for cold fusion;
b) creation of deuterons in the same place as that in which they are to fuse;
c) poisoning of the Pd, leading to no more deuteride;
d) much deuterium is wasted as D2 gas and not used for fusion.
The invention produces a dense plasma (10-1000 times as dense as plasma formed
by high frequency fields) from gaseous D2, and then accelerates the deuterons
towards the Pd target by means of a voltage field. The plasma is generated by
resonance of microwave and magnetism. The gas is >= 98% pure D2 plus a little
H2 and He. There are further details of heat exchange for the heat produced,
prevention of overheating of the magnets etc.

tries to provide reliable cold fusion. Here, instead of microwave resonance
with magnetism, a high frequency electric field ("500 KHz to 500 MHz, for

target.

"Electrochemical nuclear fusion method".
** Yamazaki (working for the Semiconductor Energy Laboratory Co., Japan)
starts by summarising what is wrong with the way Jones+(89) carry out
electrolytic cold fusion. The use of atmospheric pressure reduces the
probability of cold fusion; the reaction tends to occur at a localised section
of the electrode from the rise in temperature at that point; poisoning of the
cathode leads to side reactions and product decomposition, and the deuterium
ends up in the atmosphere, so the amount used for fusion is small; says Y.
The invention describes a pressurised cell, with the evolved gases (which are
kept separate) providing the pressure. A heat exchanger removes the excess
heat, thus keeping the cell temperature down. The cathode is either Pd or Ti,
the electrolyte being a mixture not unlike that of Jones+(89). Neutrons are
measured by a detector; nuclear fusion "is obviously accelerated when the
reaction at the cathode is implemented under high pressure". Up to 200 atm
can be used. The neutrons released can cause subsequent nuclear fusion by
breeding, so there is some danger of an atomic explosion, which can be
prevented by controlling the extent of electrolysis. This is done by pulsing
the current, to a level not exceeding the critical nuclear fusion value.
Two example experiments showed that the neutron flux is proportional to the
pressure, and can be controlled by the duty ratio of the pulsed current.
Excess heat was also observed.
