                       BONUSES TO ENCHANT
     Magicians get a bonus to the Enchant roll when enchanting a
gem with a spell appropriate to the stone's divine association. 
For sacred stones, the bonus ranges from 10 to 50 percentiles,
depending on the size and quality of the stone.  Blessed stones
receive a bonus between 5 and 25.  
     Gems give an increased bonus when engraved with the image of
an appropriate god.  Gems give a further bonus to enchant when
they bear holy words or words of the spell.  A gem gives a bonus
to enchant a Control or Dominate [animal] spell if the animal's
image is on the gem.  A gem in the shape of the animal also gives
such a bonus.  Different enchantments may get different bonuses
with the same stone.
     Very rare stones have a deep mystical receptivity for
enchantments.  On a special success with the Enchant skill, the
enchanted spell has double strength in some way.  If the gem
ordinarily gives a bonus, that bonus is doubled.  On a critical
success, the spell has vastly increased power.  On a fumble,
however, the caster loses the ability to use the spell.  

                    MAGICAL DETECTION SPELLS
     The following list provides Detect and Find Substance spells
for each cult that has them.  Note that the rules give many cults
Find (substance) spells without specifying which cult finds which
substances.  This list includes gems and non-gems, to fill a need
for this information.  It includes all the published cults, and
some unpublished ones.
