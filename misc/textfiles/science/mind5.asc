                   Alterations in Imaginings and Suggestibility
                       During Brief Magnetic Field Exposures

                    by Christine F. DeSano and M. A. Persinger
                             at Laurentian University

                    originally in Perceptual Motor Skills, 1987
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Male and female subjects were exposed to alternating magnetic fields
       of 1 and  4  Hertz  which  were  applied  across  their mid-superior
       Temporal lobes.

       In addition, a green light was pulsed  in  phase  with  the magnetic
       field while the participant was instructed to imagine  an  encounter
       with an alien.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Rostral (at nose  level)  to  the upper half of the ear, retractable
       arms were placed, each containing  a 25 CM (1 CM diameter) soft iron
       nail wrapped (1050 turns) with insulated wire (20 gauge).

       A function generator was used to drive the solenoids  with sine wave
       current at either 1 HZ or 4 HZ.

       Magnetic field intensity was about 15 GAUSS at the skull surface.

       Field strength measured at the temporal cortex was 2 GAUSS.

       Maximum field strength as measured at the level of the frontal lobes
       was 200 MGAUSS (a 10 factor decrease).

       At the level of the hippocampus, field strength was 500 MGAUSS.

       All subjects generated  elaborate imaginings when exposed to a green
       light flashing in sync with the driven solenoids.

       4 HZ field imaginings included a sensation of rising or floating.

       The end result  of  the  experiment was that hypnotic susceptibility
       may be increased following magnetic-field exposure but that the most
       effective frequency is different for each sex.

       The quantity of   imagery   generated   (particular   the   floating
       sensations) INCREASED if  the  person observed a light  flashing  in
       sync with a 4 HZ applied magnetic field.

       Most interesting of  all  was that the magnetic field strengths were
       MUCH LESS than those expected to occur in NATURAL SETTINGS.

       Vangard Notes..

             OMNI writer  Dennis  Stacy   did  an  article  on  Persinger's
             research in December of 1988 (I think).  It  relates  the  UFO
             encounter  phenomenon  and  how  it  could  quite  possibly be
             INDUCED  by  alternating  magnetic  fields  of  relatively low
             intensity.

             As  I remember the  article,  Persinger  was  using a football
             helmet  with   multiple   solenoids   placed  in  a  grid  and
             supported over the skull.

             When the  helmet  was  driven  by a computer as  a  peripheral
             device (a  printer),  various  patterns  (characters) could be
             projected onto the brain of  the  subject  to  induce  various
             effects.
