                What Someone with Mineral Lore at 51% Knows

      People in Glorantha have as much trouble telling gems apart
as people on Earth do.  They may have more, because the shape of
a stone gives no information about it.  With some exceptions, any
stone could have its shape because a sorceror formed it that way. 
Sorcerors can also mold a mottled or banded stone like clay until
it has a consistent color.  Sorcerors or simple craftsmen can
change a stone's texture.  This leaves color, transparency,
toughness, and fragility as the main distinguishing
characteristics.  Glass is the great unknown.  It can be flecked,
banded, layered, milky, silky or catseye.  It can be transparent
or translucent, or opaque if a dark color.

Notes:
s = solid (assume all gems are solid unless an m or b note
      appears)
f = flecked
m = milky or waxy
b = banded
l = layered
c = catseye
w = waxy
g = glittering
Multicolored stones are of the same transparency as solid stones
of the same type; where there is none, Tp (Transparent), Tl
(Translucent), or O (Opaque) appears.
