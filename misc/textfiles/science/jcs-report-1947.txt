If used in numbers, atomic bombs not only can nullify any nation's military
effort, but can demolish its social and economic structure and prevent their
re-establishment for long periods of time. With such weapons, especially if 
employed in conjunction with other weapons of mass destruction such as
pathogenic bacteria, it is quite possible to depopulate vast areas of the
earth's surface, leaving only vestigal remnants of man's material works.
