MIXED FLEET MANIFEST NOTES


O  THIS MANIFEST INCLUDES PAYLOAD FLIGHT ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE SPACE SHUTTLE AND NASA 
EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (ELV) MISSIONS THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1997.

O   THE MANIFEST SERVES AS A BASELINE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  PRIMARY AND COMPLEX SECOND-
ARY SPACE SHUTTLE PAYLOAD FLIGHT ASSIGNMENT CONFIRMATION IS MADE APPROXIMATELY 19 
MONTHS PRIOR TO LAUNCH.  NON-COMPLEX SECONDARY PAYLOAD ASSIGNMENTS ARE MADE 12 TO 8 
MONTHS PRIOR TO LAUNCH.

O   FOR SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHTS, PRIMARY AND COMPLEX SECONDARY PAYLOAD ASSIGNMENTS ARE SHOWN 
THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1997.  NON-COMPLEX SECONDARY PAYLOADS ARE SHOWN ONLY ON FLIGHTS 
WHICH ARE 12 MONTHS OR LESS FROM LAUNCH.

O   THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT, PENDING REQUIREMENTS ARE NOTED "FOR NASA PLANNING PURPOSES 
(NOT CURRENTLY BUDGETED)"

O   SPACE SHUTTLE LAUNCH DATES ARE BEING SHOWN BY MONTH AND YEAR FROM NOW THROUGH FISCAL 
YEAR 1994 (SEPTEMBER 1994).  THE MONTH SHOWN REPRESENTS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION AS TO 
WHEN THE LAUNCH WILL OCCUR; HOWEVER, IN MOST CASES, NASA'S PLANNING WILL BE AGAINST 
EARLIER LAUNCH DATE TARGETS.  FROM FISCAL YEAR 1995 THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 1997 LAUNCHES 
ARE SHOWN BY QUARTER.  AS ABOVE, NASA'S PLANNING MAY BE AGAINST LAUNCH DATE TARGETS IN 
THE QUARTER PRIOR TO THE ONES SHOWN.
