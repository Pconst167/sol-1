This turned out to betrue for Rumpus, the hero(?) of our story.  It just so happened that thehomecoming dance for Rumpus' school was going to be on Hallowe'en night...onethat Rumpus will not soon forget.Friday, 10/30, 12:11 PM-----------------------     It was fourth period that Rumpus was headed to.  His friend, that we willjust call "Bill," had lined Rumpus up with a friend of his girlfriend to go tothe homecoming dance with.  Rumpus was excited at the thought of actuallygetting to dance with a girl that wasn't his mother or cousin for the firsttime in his whole life.  "Hmmm...I wonder what she looks like," Rumpus saidquietly to himself as he walked into his English room.  He took his normal seatnext to his only friend in the whole school.     "Hey, Bill, what's up?" Rumpus asked through his nose.     "I talked to Magen and she said that she will go out with you tomorrownight if you pay her."     "Unh!  How much is she asking for?"     "She said that since you were a friend of mine, she would only charge youjust fifty dollars."     "Hey, that's not too bad.  I'll ask my dad and mom for the money tonightafter school."     "Don't forget your tuxedo and car...Buhahahahahah!"     "Unh!"     Rumpus knew that he didn't have a car.  He knew he didn't have a license.This was going to be quite a challenge if he wanted to take Magen tohomecoming.  When Rumpus got home from band practice that night, he asked hisdad if he could borrow fifty dollars.  When Rumpus' dad asked why he needed somuch money, Rumpus said it was so he could pay for a date to the homecomingdance.  Rumpus Senior then gave Rumpus Junior a big lecture about prostitutesand other evils of the world and grounded him for the weekend.  Needless tosay, Rumpus was quite depressed at the fact that he was grounded fromhomecoming and would have to stay home.Friday, 10/30, 11:54 PM-----------------------     Rumpus calls Bill and tells him the bad news about him being grounded.After about half an hour, Bill manages to convince Rumpus to sneak out of hishouse and take his father's car on Saturday night.  Rumpus reluctantly agrees.Saturday, 10/31, 6:28 PM------------------------     "Rumpus!  Come down for dinner!" Rumpus' mother yells upstairs.     "Coming, mother!" said Rumpus zipping his pants up and putting theNovember issue of Penthouse magazine away.  He walked over to his dresser andpulled out a small packet of chloral hydrate that he made after reading a textfile on it on his Commodore computer that he loved so much.  "I really hopethis stuff works well," Rumpus thought to himself.  He put the packet in hisshirt pocket and walked downstairs to the dinner table.     After playing around with his peas and corn for a little while, Rumpusoffered to fix his parents some more tea.  They complimented him on what a goodson he was even though he was grounded for hiring a prostitute.  Rumpus tooktheir glasses and walked into the kitchen.  He made them some more tea thenpulled the packet full of chloral hydrate from his shirt pocket.  "This shoulddo the trick..." he laughed as he poured generous amounts in both glasses.     "Here you go, Mom.  And here's yours, Dad," he said as he set theirglasses down in front of them.     Rumpus' mother must have been extremely thirsty as she grabbed the tea andtook a sip and she then gulped down the whole thing.  Rumpus stared at her fora while, but then her little slanted eyes fell shut and her head slammed intoher plate full of food.     "Stupid ho," said Rumpus Senior as he got up from the table, "She nevercould hold her drinks for too long.  Oh well, since she's asleep, I think I'llgo out and fool around with my mistress."  He wiped his mouth and took a big,long drink from his tea glass then turned around and started to walk to get hiscoat before he collapsed on the couch.  Rumpus' mother was making small,gagging sounds.     "It worked!  This is my chance to get out of the house," Rumpus exclaimed.     Rumpus ran upstairs and put his father's tuxedo on.  They were both aroundfive foot, two inches, so it fit him like a glove.  "You're such a stud," hesaid to himself in the the mirror.  He then splashed on half a bottle of Brutcologne then went downstairs.     Now to get the car keys.  Rumpus rolled his father over on the couch.First he reached in his father's back pocket and pulled out his father'swallet.  Rumpus put his father's wallet in his back pocket and tossed his ownout on the coffee table.  Then he reached in his father's front pocket to getthe car keys.  While he was fumbling in the pocket, Rumpus Senior bent his legsup and started to speak in his sleep while he was having a sexual dream.     "Oh, move it faster, baby," said Rumpus Senior sluggishly as he yankedRumpus' arm back and forth.  Rumpus was startled and tried to pull his hand outof his dad's pocket, but his dad's leg was bent too much for him to get itfree.  Rumpus Senior reached up and grabbed Rumpus by the back of the head andpulled his face close to his own.  Rumpus Senior smushed his lips againstRumpus' and stuck his tongue into Rumpus' mouth and squirmed it around inside.Rumpus grabbed the ashtray off the coffee table and whacked his dad over theback of the head with it and Rumpus Senior fell back to the couch limply.Rumpus pulled his hand out of the pocket with the car keys and placed theashtray down.     "Hmmm...so that's what it's like to french-kiss," Rumpus pondered.  Hewent into the garage and started the car.  Rumpus drove to Bill's house andpicked him up.  Bill was impressed about how Rumpus managed to get out of thehouse, but was even more impressed with the fact that Rumpus found out what itwas like to french-kiss.  His girlfriend, Peggy, would only let him kiss her onthe cheek.  He asked Rumpus what it was like so Rumpus showed him.Saturday, 10/31, 8:00 PM------------------------     Rumpus and Bill picked up Peggy (who happened to have a wooden peg-leg)and then went to Magen's house.  Rumpus walked up to the door and rang the doorbell.  Magen answered the door and waved to Bill and Peggy out in the car.Then she saw Rumpus and said hi.     "Before we leave, Rumpus, do you have the fifty dollars?" she asked him.     "Unh!  Yeah, I have it right here," he whined through his nose as hepulled out his father's wallet and took a fifty-dollar bill out and handed itto Magen.     "Thank you.  Remember I have to be home by twelve."     "Unh!  Okay."     They got into Rumpus Senior's '88 fuel-injected turbo Yugo and tore out at20 miles-an-hour or whatever the top speed is for those things.  Rumpus was amaster at grinding gears as he ripped the stick-shift half to pieces by thetime they reached the school.     They all got out of the Rumpusmobile and went inside paying the fivedollar door charge.  Once inside, they went to the chairs along the wall fornone of the nerdlings knew how to even slow dance.     After sitting there for forty-five minutes listening to the latest"top-40" music, Rumpus got up and offered to go get punch for all of them.They accepted and he went on his merry way.  "I hope he doesn't expect me tokiss him," Magen pouted.  "I hope you don't expect me to kiss you, Bill," Peggywarned.     Rumpus circled the refreshments table in search of the punch.  He finallyspotted it after he noticed two drunk seniors walking away from it zipping uptheir pants.  Rumpus walked to the punch bowl and filled up four glasses fullof the urinated punch.  He carefully took the punch back to the other three andgave them their glasses.  They all gulped it down.  The girls started feeling alittle "tipsy" probably due to the extra ingredients in the punch.  They stoodup and started dancing or rather just flailing their arms and legs about in andirection even though a slow-dance song was being played right now.  The girlsmanaged to knock over several couples before they hit up against the walls andfell over.     Rumpus and Bill were not fairing too well themselves.  They walked over toa large group of football players and started screaming obscenities at them tothe effect of "you're a bunch of stupid fucking jocks!"  It took nearlyseventeen minutes before the both of them were regained consciousness.     Deciding that the dance was too much for all of them, they left the dance.Rumpus started the Yugo and turned on the radio.  "This is an important newsbulletin just in...a convicted mass murderer has just escaped from Rumpusville,Illinois State Prison--"  Rumpus turned the radio off because the girls weregetting scared.     "There's no need to worry, girls," Rumpus said, "That place is too farfrom here.  It's at least three-quarters of a mile away.  And besides, Bill andI will protect you."  This didn't make the girls feel too much better, but theydecided there was no use in worrying.     Rumpus drove the Yugo up to Lookout Point and parked the car so it wasoverlooking the city.  Bill and Peggy started kissing each other's cheeks inthe back seat as Rumpus and Magen sat in the front seat.  Rumpus looked atMagen as she stared out over the city.     "Don't even think about it, Rumpus," she said.     "I WANT YOUR BODY YOU LUSTY-EYED MOMMA!" Rumpus screamed as he jumped ontop of her.  She fought back furiously.  The Yugo, being a light car and sinceRumpus didn't put the parking brake on, started to roll forwards towards thehill.  It turned on its side and rolled down the hill bouncing up and downuntil it finally came to rest against a tree.     "You putz, Rumpus!" everyone yelled in unison.     "No problem...I'll get us out of here," said Rumpus as he switched theYugo to four-wheel drive and drove up the forty-seven degree incline.  Once hereached the crest, Rumpus parked the car making sure to put the brake back on."Now where were we..." he whispered to Magen with a smile on his face.     She screamed when the mass murderer jumped on the hood of the Yugo with achainsaw.  Rumpus screamed the loudest, though.  He pulled the hood-releaselever and the hood popped open sending the man flying to the ground some fiftyfeet behind the car.  Rumpus opened the door and started heading for theforest.  Magen was running right behind him as was Bill and Peggy.  Themurderer caught up with Peggy, though, and brought the chainsaw down on herformal and it sliced clean through her leg.  She fell to the ground and turnedto look at the murderer.  He was instead staring back at her in amazementwondering why she didn't scream.  She picked up her splintered wooden leg andshove it into the man's testicles killing him instantly.     "It's safe to come out now!" she yelled.     Bill and Magen crawled out of the bushes over to Peggy.  Rumpus startedscreaming because he could get down out of the top of a tree.  Bill picked upthe chainsaw and cut the base of the tree and yelled "Timber!"  The tree fellover crushing two parked car with teenagers inside and then the top hit a carwith a moon roof which Rumpus fell through onto two more teenagers in the actof fornicating.     Rumpus climbed out of the car and back into his own Yugo with the otherkids.  He started the engine and rocketed back down the hill to drop Magen andthe rest off since it was getting late.     After he dropped Bill off, Rumpus decided to see what his father's carcould do.  He found a long, empty stretch of suburban street and floored theaccelerator.  The engine raced hotter and hotter.  As Rumpus went through a redlight, he didn't notice the police car sitting at the other side of theintersection.  The police turned their car around and went after Rumpus.  Hetried to out-race them, but they caught him within 200 yards.  They shot outthe tires on the Yugo and it flipped over.  The police got out of their car andran over to the Yugo and pulled Rumpus out right before the Yugo exploded intoa large fireball.     The police woke Rumpus up and asked him for some ID.  He reached for hiswallet and then realized that it was his father's.  He gave them his dad'sdriver's license.  They looked at it puzzled.  "Are you sure you're fifty-fouryears old, Mr. Rumpus Senior?" one of them asked him.     "Uh, yeah!  That's right," Rumpus stammered.     "I think we'll have to sort this one out down at the station, bud," thecop said.  They grabbed Rumpus and hauled him back to the police car.     "No!  I can't go to jail!  I can't!" Rumpus pleaded.     The police slammed the back door of the police car and then drove offleaving the flaming Yugo lying in the middle of the otherwise quiet suburbiastreet.Note:  The Rumpus has no affiliation whatsoever with Omnipotent, Inc. or any of=-=-=  our members.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------(C) 1987 -- Omnipotent, Incorporated-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Dark Side of the Moon AE/BBS.................................[408] 245-SPAMThe Haunted House BBS............................................[408] 773-1202The Works Textfile Leeching FBBS.................................[914] 238-8195PUD (Pez's Underground Dump).....................................[313] 433-3164-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Next -- The Rumpus Chronicles Part IV:  Rumpus in Prison_______________________________________________________________________________
