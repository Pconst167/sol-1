Could this bethe one that they had thought was gone from their lives forever?  A singlebolt of lightening burst from the rain cloud overhead and struck our solitaryperson briefly lighting up his skeleton before spiking his hair even more.  Hefell face first into the mud of the field and merely issued an "UNH!" beforehe passed out.  The Rumpus had returned.     The next morning, the rain clouds had briefly dispersed to allow somesunlight to shine on Alief as all of the students started off to high schoolready for a Friday of hard work (yeah, right).  It was the final year ofschool for many students that would soon be starting either a career orcollege.  They had many things to consider and plan for over the next few daysas they prepared for graduation.  The last thing that they believed they wouldhave to worry about managed to infiltrate the student body as they pressedinto Elsik Senior High School.  Rumpus wore a florescent-orange rain coat witha hood to cover up his hair and adorned sunglasses to avoid drawingattention to himself and being recognized.  He would merely be gatheringinformation today to plan for his ultimate revenge.  What was he doing here?Why did he return after being gone for so many years?  Who or what was heplanning revenge against?  We will get to these questions soon enough, butmeanwhile...     On the north side of the campus, Jason pulled his crappy blue 1982Mustang in his parking space.  He opened the door and got his books out of theback seat.  Slamming the door and giving the car a kick for good measure hebounced his way up to the main building running into many of his friends alongthe way.  Out of the corner of his eye, he barely caught his old girlfriend,Jennifer, narrowly jumping out of the way of a big red pickup truck (withtinted windows and white mag wheels) that purposely seemed to be aiming ather.  The truck jumped over the drainage ditch and went driving off across thepractice football field before disappearing behind the annex building.  Jasonwould have sworn he could hear "Oh L'Amour" playing from the truck even thoughall of the windows were rolled up on it.  "I wonder if that could be who Ithink it was..." he quietly wondered to himself.     "Hi, Jen," Jason said as he approached Jennifer.     "Oh, hi, Jason," Jennifer replied as she was climbing down off of thetelephone pole.     "That truck looked familiar.  Something tells me it going to be a weirdweekend," Jason mused, "Can I walk you to class?"     "Sure," Jennifer replied in her most natural simple-minded way.     During lunch that day, Jason noticed a short, round person wearing aflorescent-orange rain jacket with the hood pulled over his head and TeenageMutant Ninja Turtle sunglasses in the lunch line.  "I swear that guy has beenfollowing me all day," Jason thought to himself as he sat down at his lunchtable.  Rumpus was going through the line picking out food left and right.  Hespent most of his time hovering over the dessert section.  Rumpus walkedbackwards out the end of the lunch line to avoid having to pay for his food.He balanced both trays on one arm as he pulled a chair out from a table.  Heset one tray down on the chair as he placed the other one down on the table.All of the sudden, his Rumpus-Sense(tm) started tingling meaning there wasdanger near.  He turned around to see one of his targets walking past him.Rumpus sat down and faced the other direction in a hurry.  Luckily, Jeffdidn't recognize Rumpus.  "That was a close one," Rumpus thought to himself.He chowed down his lunch and sat at his table for a while just perusing thecafeteria for everyone that was in it.  "I can't believe nobody here can tellwho I am right now...maybe I'm invisible?" he asked himself.  He stood up andstarted walking for the stairwell when he heard a growing noise from thecafeteria.  When he turned around he saw that everybody was laughinghysterically.  He looked around to find the source of such humor, then herealized everyone was laughing at him.  He had forgotten that he set one trayof food on his chair before he sat down in a hurry.  He had a tray stuck tohis butt with spaghetti and strawberry shortcake oozing out around the edges."UNNNGGHH!  They might recognize me!"  Rumpus dashed to the stairwell knockingover small trees in the atrium on his way.  After Jason finished laughing, athought struck him:  "Only one person could've done something that stupid, buthe's thousands of miles away and nobody's heard from him in years."     After peeling the tray from his posterior, Rumpus left the school andheaded over to West Oaks Mall to hang out.  He was chased around the mall bysecurity when he mistook "hanging out" as meaning exposing your private partsin public.  He warped the minds of many of the children in the toy store afterhe ran by with genitalia flailing in the breeze.  He played some video gamesreminiscing of the glory days that he would spend playing with his Commodore64 computer.  After school was out for the weekend, many of the students fromthe school made their way to the mall to do the wanky things that people theirage tend to do at such social gatherings.  Rumpus followed many other peoplearound the mall, most of it was because he had nothing better to do, but partof it was because he was waiting for the right moment...     Chris -- once a proud 12 year-old member of the exclusive CommodoreKingdom club that Rumpus ruled in the early days, but now just your normalhormonally-active 18 year-old senior in high school -- was checking out thelatest CDs that were on sale in Sound Warehouse.  He downed the rest of his32-ounce Coke and tossed the CD that he was going to buy up on the counter.     "'Front 242 Does Elvis'?" asked the young salesgirl.     "Supposed to be a classic," Chris replied.     "Whatever..." the salesgirl said blandly.  She rang up the sale and tookChris' $14.99.  Chris walked down the mall looking in various windows alongthe way.  He stopped at the pet store to look at the rabbits in the window.He saw a short, round fellow wearing a florescent-orange raincoat and TeenageMutant Ninja Turtle sunglasses walk past him and into the pet store.  Thisfellow kept looking back at Chris.  "I swear that person was looking at me inSound Warehouse," thought Chris.  He walked on.  Rumpus stuck two rabbits anda parrot in his jacket and a Guiana pig in his pants for dinner that night.     Chris was walking down the mall when he felt his bladder start to rumble."Uh-oh!  Must've been the Coke.  Damn stuff went right through me."  He headedfor the mall bathrooms.  This time, he didn't notice the figure in the orangejacket follow him.  He went into one of the stalls and let his pants down tosit on the stool.  He was looking at the jacket of his new CD when he noticedthe feet of someone walk over to the urinals on the other side of thebathroom.  He went back to looking at the CD.  All of the sudden he heard aloud, high-pitched, whining, vibrating sound.  WHIRRRRRRRRRR!  His heart sankdown into his stomach as his memory raced to figure out where he had heardthat sound before.  "NO!  It couldn't be...not after all of these years"  Heremembered a day in the Rumpus Room many years ago when he heard the samenoise.  It was during that day that Rumpus was actually revealed to be aRumpuser.  The door to the stall was kicked open.  Chris was blinded by abright light behind the short, round figure that was standing there.  Thefigure reached to his head and pulled off two straight, pointed, mousse-hardened locks of hairs and threw them at Chris like spikes.  The spikes wentthrough Chris' shirt at the shoulders and pinned him to the wall.     "This will teach you not to moon me in my own backyard!" the figuredsaid.  Chris screamed as the last thing he heard before everything went blackwas a ZIP! then the WHIRRRRRRRRRR!     Moments later, Rumpus made his way to the mall exit just as there werescreams and yelling coming from the men's restroom as people made the grislydiscovery.  Rumpus quietly chuckled to himself.  "They'll all be sorry theyever made fun of me..." he mused.  Then he threw his head back and startedlaughing out loud in a long, sinister laugh.  He didn't see the ambulancerushing up to the mall entrance when it hit him.  The cleaning people mistookhim for a florescent-orange garbage bag and threw him in the dumpster where hespent many hours unconscious.     Around nine o' clock that night, the clouds started to gather togetheragain.  They opened up on Suburbia Alief with a fierceness not seen in a longtime.  Rumpus felt the rain on his face and pulled the jacket up around him ashe climbed out of the garbage dumpster.  He stumbled over to his RumpusScooter and rode back to his base of operations:  His old house that has beenempty for several years now.  He parked his scooter in the bushes just insidethe gate and went around to the backyard.  He opened the big window on theback of the house and climbed in out of the rain.  Feeling somewhat tired, hejust jumped out of the window sill and onto the now-empty carpet.  His heartjumped when he heard a high-pitched voice say, "AAAAUUCK!  POLLY WANT THE HELLOUTTA HERE!"  He realized the voice was coming from inside his jacket so hepulled the parrot out.  The parrot flapped its wings and tried to fly forfreedom when Rumpus grabbed it and tied a piece of twine around one of itsclaws.  He tied the other end to the closet doorknob.     "Every good pirate should have a parrot," Rumpus said to Polly.  Rumpusrolled up the edge of the carpet and removed a loose floorboard to reveal hispirate flag (the "Jolly Flogger" as he used to call it) and his eye patch.  Hehad hidden them there when he thought he was going to be arrested forillegally copying "Summer Games" for his Commodore 64.  He put on his eyepatch and hung the flag on the wall like he used to do in his old softwarepirating days.  Rumpus commenced talking like a pirate ("Argh, avast ye scurvydogs!  Prepare to boarded!") until he was thoroughly bored.  He then went tothe kitchen to fix dinner.  He pulled the Guiana pig out of his pants.  TheGuiana pig was gasping for fresh air when Rumpus stuck it in the oven.  Later,as Rumpus was pulling Guiana pig hair out from between his teeth, he flippedon the television that he just happened to bring with him.  He tuned in to thenews.     "THIS JUST IN!" blared the anchorman, "An eighteen year-old youthidentified only as 'Chris' was found unconscious in a stall of the West OaksMall men's room.  He was covered with a sticky white substance; however,police do not believe it to be a sexually motivated attack.  The young mankept mumbling something about the return of the end of humanity.  He wasquickly tranquilized and taken to the hospital for severe trauma treatment.More news at ten."  --CLICK!--  Rumpus turned off the television.     Mike was getting ready to go to a party.  He took a shower and did theother things that people normally do when getting ready to go some place.  Ashe was getting dressed, he didn't notice a florescent-orange object streak byhis window in his back yard.  He had the radio turned up really loud as thethunder outside was almost deafening at times.  Little did he realize thatprying eyes were squinting at him through the window.     Mike finished getting dressed, grabbed his car keys and headed for thefront door grabbing an umbrella along the way.  He popped the umbrella openand stepped out into the rain locking the door behind him.  He was half-way tohis car when he heard a noise behind him.  It started growing louder:WHIRRRRRRRRR!  He turned around just in time to see Rumpus running towardshim.  Rumpus reached up and pulled a spike off his head and threw it at Mike.The umbrella snapped in two as the razor-sharp spike pierced the handle.  Mikestared at Rumpus in horror then took off running down the street.  Rumpuspursued.  After several blocks Rumpus realized his short legs were no matchfor Mike's longer legs.  He was falling behind.  Rather than let Mike get awayand warn the others, Rumpus remembered something.  He reached into hisflorescent-orange camouflage raincoat and pulled out a rabbit he hadshoplifted earlier that day.  When the incredible strength that Rumpuspossessed in his right arm, Rumpus lobbed the rabbit at a mind-numbing speed.The rabbit flew through the air (with the greatest of ease...).  It landedsquare in the middle of Mike's back, knocking the wind out of him.  He fell tothe ground from the force.  The rabbit, slightly stunned, hopped off and gotwashed into the sewer.  Rumpus slowly walked up to Mike and turned him over.     "This will teach you for opening up the bathroom door that day andstarting all of this," Rumpus said with a sinister grin on his face.  ZIP!WHIRRRRRRRRR!  Michael's scream pierced the suburban quiet only for an instantbefore it was drowned out by the thundering noise from the heavens.     Jennifer jumped as the thunder broke overhead and the lighteningilluminated the living room through the skylight on the high overhead ceiling.The electricity flickered off then back on for half a second.  Jennifer wastalking to her cousin on the phone:     "I don't know, Aida, he's been bugging me all day," she was saying whenshe heard a noise in the backyard.  "Just a second, I heard something outback."  She put the phone down and went to the backdoor.  She peeked out thebackdoor curtains, but couldn't see anything.  Jennifer ran back to the phone: "Let me call you right back."  She put the receiver in the cradle and grabbedher phone book.  She was starting to get frightened since she was all alone inthe house.  Her mother was out on a date and she had to cancel her plansbecause of the rain.  Hurriedly, she dialed several people, but nobody washome.  Reluctantly, she called Jason.     -- RING! --  -- RING! --  "Hello?"     "Jason, this is Jennifer!  There's someone in my backyard...please comeover, fast!"     "Okay, I'm on my way.  Stay put."     Within few minutes, Jason arrived to play the "the man is here soeverything is safe" routine.  He checked out back, but could find nothingthere.  He went back inside and told this to Jennifer.  They sat down on thesofa and started talking.  They didn't realize that someone was watching themthrough the skylight.  Rumpus stood up and slowly walked down the slant of theroof towards the front of the house for no apparent reason.  He looked aroundto see if anybody else was watching.  Rumpus stealthily walked back up theroof.  When he reached the peak of the roof, his foot slipped on a looseshingle.  He started to lose his balance.  He grabbed onto the televisionantenna with the superhuman strength of his right hand and balanced himself.Just then, a bolt of lightening flashed down and struck the antenna whileRumpus was holding onto it.     Jason and Jennifer watched as the picture on the television went out."That's funny, the TV antenna is grounded.  That shouldn't have happened,"Jennifer said.  As Jennifer completed her sentence, they heard a noise:WHIRRRRR-- WHIRRR-- WHIRR-- WHIR--.  It seemed to sputter out.  There was acrashing noise and glass showered down into the living room as a florescent-orange Rumpus fell through the skylight.  The smoking Rumpus landed right infront of the sofa with a broken television antenna clutched in his hand.Rumpus appeared to be unconscious.     "What the Hell is that?" Jason said as he got up off the sofa and bentdown by Rumpus.  "No, it couldn't be...," he pondered upon closer examination,"I didn't even think that he alive anymore.  What's he doing here?  Jennifer,go call an ambulance."  Jason stood up.     Before Jennifer could reach the phone, Rumpus jumped up and grabbed Jasonaround the throat from behind.  Rumpus jumped on Jason's back.  Jason couldn'thandle the weight as he fell to the floor.  As Rumpus was pounding Jason'shead into the carpet he was screaming, "And that's for mooning me in my ownbackyard then taking a crap in it!"     Jennifer grabbed the lamp off the coffee table and took a swing atRumpus.  She caught Rumpus square in the forehead with the end of the lamp.Rumpus went flying through the air and landed against the wall half silly.She helped Jason stand up.     "We've got to get outta here," Jason managed to get out.  They startedout the door and got in Jason's car.  As they were racing off, Rumpusstaggered to the doorway.  He threw several spikes at them, but missed throughall of the rain.  Rumpus pulled his Rumpus Scooter out of the SouthwesternBell manhole (excuse, me..."sewer access cover" for you feminists).  Rumpushad used the underground telephone tunnels to race around in, but this onecalled for surface pursuit.     Jason had punched his Mustang as fast as it would go, but there was onlyso fast that an old 3.8 liter fuel-injected V6 would go.  Rumpus spotted themless than half a mile ahead.  He reached down onto the side of his scooter.He tossed the Turbo Covers off the sides.  He then flipped a switch on thedash that flashed "TURBO SYSTEM ARMED -- NITROUS OXIDE TANKS READY."  With thepress of a button, the Nitrous Oxide systems fed the gas into the fuel lineand flames shot out the back.     Faster than the fastest bullet-bike, the Rumpus Scooter easily caught upwith the car by the time they reached the school.  Rumpus pulled along theside of Jason's Mustang and threw some hair at the tires.  The tires explodedand the car screeched to a stop in the middle of the intersection.  Jason andJennifer got out of the car, but then just stood there in fear as Rumpuscircled back around and stopped the scooter just fifteen yards from them.They trembled with dread as Rumpus got off the scooter and started towardsthem.     "You made fun of me for all of those years...even after I moved acrossthe country you still tormented me.  That's all over now..." Rumpus wassaying.  ZIP!  WHIRRRRRRR!     But before Rumpus could take another step, two bright halogen headlightscame up behind him with blinding speed.  They came right up to Rumpus and hithim with earth-shaking force.  Rumpus flew threw the air and stuck head-firstinto a telephone poll by his spiked hair.  The big red truck slid sideways toa stop.  The door flew open and out stepped their saviour.     "ROB!" they both shouted in unison.     "Hi!  I'd been heading out this way to pick someone up when I saw Rumpus.I knew that he meant trouble.  Quick, Jason, help me get him in the back ofthe truck," Rob said.  He opened up his tool box and grabbed some rope andduct tape.  They tied Rumpus up and put duct tape around his waist so that hecouldn't move; however, they only had four feet of tape left so they couldonly put it a little more than half way around him.     "Okay, Jason," Rob said, "let's throw Rumpus in the back and take him fora ride.  Jennifer, you stay here and change all the flat tires on Jason'scar." They got in the truck and started speeding north out of town.  Within thehour, they arrived at Intercontinental Airport.  They drove the truck throughone of the fences and headed for the fueling area.  They found a plane headedfor Columbia and tossed the unconscious Rumpus onto the baggage loadingconveyor belt.  Rumpus slid upwards then disappeared into the baggagecompartment of the 737 headed for Bogota.     Afterwards, they went up to the restaurant at the airport.  Jenniferarrived shortly after she had fixed the tires and drove to the airport.  Theytalked for a while.  Right after they finished dinner and were having drinks,they heard a noise that struck fear in their hearts.  WHIRRRRRRRR!  When theyturned around all they saw was a waiter with a small chainsaw trying to cut atough piece of turkey.     "Sorry, didn't mean to startle you," apologized the waiter.     "No problem," said Jason turning back to the table, "Anyway, all I knowis that Rumpus just came back and decided to get even with all of us."     "Kind of scary," replied Rob, "but you know how much of a Rumpus he wasanyway.  I'm just glad it's over."     Jennifer started up, "Oh, by the way, Rob.  I asked my friend Yvette tomeet us here...she says she knows you.  There she is."     "Ulp!" was all Rob could get out as Heaven came through the doorway.  Shewalked up and sat down next to him.     "Isn't this the cutest face you've ever seen?" Yvette asked Jennifer andJason as she grabbed Rob's face.     "Ulp!" was all he could still manage to get out.     Meanwhile, some 50,000 feet above the Gulf of Mexico, there was a 737 AirColumbia airplane flying strong.  However, the pressure in the baggagecompartment dropped sharply as a long, black spike of mousse-hardened hairpierced the outer hull.------------------------------------------------------------------------------This has been a Tampered-With Production (c) 1990------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you have any suggestions, comments, death threats, etc. directed towardsOmnipotent, Inc. or any of it's members, we can be reached via The Dark Sideof the Moon...[408] 245-SPAM...account number 27.
