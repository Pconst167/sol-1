If fuel oil is not available, use one half    measure of motor oil.  Store in a waterproof container until ready to use.[3] Spoon this mixture into an iron or steel pipe which has an end cap threaded    on one end.  If a pipe is not available, you may use a dry tin can, a glass    jar or a heavy-walled cardboard tube.NOTE:  Take care not to tamp or shake the mixture in the pipe.  If mixture~~~~~  becomes tightly packed, one cap will not be sufficient to initiate the       explosive.[4] Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the explosive mix.                     Blasting Cap =>   "                                     # " #                                  +- #%"%#                       One inch --+  #%"%#                                  +- #%"%#                                     #%%%#                                     #%%%#NOTE:  Confining the open end of the container will add to the effectiveness of~~~~~  the explosive.
