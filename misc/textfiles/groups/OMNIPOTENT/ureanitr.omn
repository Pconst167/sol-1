Urea nitrate can be used as anexplosive munition.  It is easy to prepare from nitric acid and urine (piss).It can be detonated with a blasting cap.MATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[1] Nitric acid, 90% concentrated (1.48 specific gravity)    - Field grade or industrial metal processors[2] Urine    - Animals (including humans)[3] 2 one gallon heat and acid    resistant containers (glass, clay, etc.)[4] Filtering material    - Paper towel or finely textured cotton cloth (shirt, sheet, etc.)[5] Aluminum powder (optional or if available)    - Paint stores[6] Heat source (fire, stove, etc.)[7] Measuring containers (cup and spoon)[8] Water[9] Tape[10] Blasting cap[11] Steel pipe and end cap(s)NOTE:  Prepare mixture just before usePROCEDURE=-=-=-=-=[1] Boil a large quantity of urine (10 cups) to approximately 1/10 its volume    (1 cup) in one of the containers over the heat source.[2] Filter the urine into the other container through the filtering material to    remove impurities.[3] Slowly add 1/3 cup of nitric acid to the filtered urine, and let mixture    stand for 1 hour.CAUTION:  Acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled wash it~~~~~~~~  away with a large quantity of water.[4] Filter mixture as in step 2.  Urea nitrate crystals will collect on the    paper.[5] Wash the urea nitrate by pouring water over it.[6] Remove urea nitrate crystals from the filtering material and allow to dry    thoroughly (approximately 16 hours).NOTE:  The drying time can be reduced to two hours if a hot (not boiling) water~~~~~  bath is used.HOW TO USE=-=-=-=-=-[1] Spoon the urea nitrate crystals into an iron or steel pipe which has an end    capped on one end.[2] Insert blasting cap just beneath the surface of the urea nitrate crystals.[3] Place and light and run.Note:  This explosive can be made more effective by mixing with aluminum powder~~~~~  (can be obtained in paint stores) in the ratio of 4 to 1.  For example,       mix 1 cup of aluminum powder with 4 cups of urea nitrate.  Confining the       open end of the container will add to the effectiveness of the       explosive.
