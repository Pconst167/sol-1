Blasting caps are probably the most popular today, since they are very functional and relatively stable.  The prime ingredient in most blasting caps and detonating devices in general is mercury fulmunate.  There are several methods for preparing fulminate.Method #1 for preparation of MF:--------------------------------1) Take 5 grams of pure mercury and mix it with 35 ml. of nitric acid.2) The mixture is slowly and gently heated.  As soon as the solution bubbles   and turns green, one knows that the silver mercury is dissolved.3) After it is dissolved, the solution should be poured, slowly, into a small   flask of ethyl alcohol.  This will result in red fumes.4) After a half hour or so, the red fumes will turn white, indicating that the   process is nearing its final stages.5) After a few minutes, add distilled water to the solution.6) The entire solution is now filtered, in order to obtain the small white   crystals.  These crystals are pure mercury fulminate, but should be washed   many times, and tested with litmus paper for any remaining undesirable acid.Method #2 for preparation of MF:--------------------------------1) Mix one part mercuric acid with ten parts ammonia solution.  When ratios are   descibed, they are always done according to weight rather than volume.2) After waiting eight to ten days, one will see that the mercuric oxide has   reacted with the ammonia solution to produce the white fulminate crystals.3) These crystals must be handled in the same way as the first method   described, in that they must be washed many times and given several litmus   paper tests.  Many other fulminates can be made in the same manner as above, but I will not go into theses, since most are extremely unstable and sensitive to shock.  All fulminates, including mercury fulminate, ae sensitive to shock and friction, and in no circumstances should they be handled in a rough or careless manner.
