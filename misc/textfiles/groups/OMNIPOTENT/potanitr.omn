Theyield ranges from .1 to 10% by weight, depending on the fertility of the soil.MATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[1] Nitrate bearing earth or other material, about 3-1/2 gallons (13-1/2    liters)    - Soil containing old decayed vegetable or animal matter    - Old cellars and/or farm dirt floors    - Earth from old burial grounds    - Decayed stone or motar building foundations[2] Fine wood ashes, about 1/2 cup (1/8 liter)    - Totally burned whitish wood ash powder    - Totally burned paper (black)[3] Bucket or similar container, about 5 gallons (19 liters) in volume    (Plastic, metal, or wood)[4] 2 pieces of finely woven cloth, each slightly larger than the bottom of the    bucket[5] Shallow pan or dish, at least as large as bottom of bucket[6] Shallow heat resistant container (ceramic, metal, etc.)[7] Water - 1-3/4 gallons (6-3/4 liters)[8] Awl, knife, screwdriver, or other hole producing instrument[9] Alcohol about 1 gallon (4 liters) (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)[10] Heat source (fire, electric heater, etc.)[11] PaperNote:  Only the ratios of the amounts of ingredients are important.

Allow    water to run through holes in bucket into shallow container.  Be sure water    goes through ALL of the earth.  Allow drained liquid to cool and settle for    1 to 2 hours.  Note:  Do not pour all of the water at once, since this may    cause stoppage.[6] Carefully drain off liquid into heat resistant container.  Discard any    sludge remaining in bottom of the shallow container.[7] Boil mixture over hot fire for at least 2 hours.  Small grains of salt will    begin to appear  in the solution.  Scoop these out as they form, using any    type of improvised strainer (paper, etc.)[8] When liquid has boiled down to approximately half its original volume,    remove from fire and let sit.  After half an hour add an equal volume of    alcohol.  When mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals will    collect on top of it.[9] To purify the potassium nitrate, re-desolve the dry crystals in the    smallest possible amount of boiled water.  Remove any salt crystals that    appear (Step 7); pour through an improvised fileter made of several pieces    of paper and evaporate or gently heat the concentrated solution to dryness.[10] Spread crystals on flat surface and allow to dry.  The potassium nitrate     crystals are now ready for use._______________________________________________________________________________
