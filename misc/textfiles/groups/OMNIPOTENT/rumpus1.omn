The answersthese ponderings and more will be explained in this exploration into a world ofa living nightmare:  The Rumpus!First the definition(s):  RUMPUS (rum-pus') -- a loud noise or obnoxious object                          RUMPUS ROOM -- residence of a RumpusBACKGROUND:     A Rumpus can be found living in the suburbs of a city just like many moreacross the United States of America.  A city with a downtown.  A city with thesuburbs.  A city that doesn't stand out much, except for the fact that itpossesses a Rumpus.  It is in the suburbia that it dwells.  The suburbia calledAlief (ay-leaf').     This Rumpus used to go a high school in the Alief Independent District ofSchools (A.I.D.S.).  It was a legend in its own time.  This Rumpus was of amale gender (so it is a commonly held belief), so we will refer to it as "he,""him," or "Ugh!" instead of "it."     The Rumpus consisted of a short (five foot, four inch) Filipino with thickvision-correction apparatuses (glasses) with spiked (porcupine) hair and wasslightly (ahem!) overweight.  Like it was stated before, he was a legend in hisown time, though it was short.     Around the school, Rumpus was considered by many to be what could becalled a "pain."  Speaking through his nose, he would issue a reply of "Unh!"to a statement that would displease him.  He was a member of the senior highschool instrumental orchestral society (also referred to as the "band") inwhich he would attempt to issue notes from an instrument known as a tuba thatwas twice as big as him and would crush him out of existence if it should everby chance fall over on him.  Considered a "stud" in his homelands on the otherside of the globe, he was thought of as quite less by the female half of thehuman race on this side.  Always becoming infatuated with attractive femalesthat would not care to sneeze in his direction at anyone's request.  This madehim turn to nocturnal activities of flogging his frog, spanking his monkey,beating his meat, whacking off, jacking off, jerking off, or as it ultimatelybecame known as, "Rumpusing off!"A LEGEND IS BORN:     [Names have been changed to protect the identities of those that would notcare to have their names printed here in association with Omnipotent,Incorporated.]     The sad tale began when Rumpus invited several friends (so he thought)over to play "VID-EE-0H GAMEZ!!1!" [Ed. note:  Sorry had to do it.].  Afterplaying with the computer for a while, Rumpus became bored and decided to takea shower (so he said).  He reached for something from behind the bed that waswrapped up in a shirt.  Clothes wrapped around a girlie magazine was what itwas.  He waddled into the bathroom whining an "Unh!" to whoever made any jokesbehind his back as he left the room.  Once behind the safety of the showerdoor, he ran to the bathtub and turned the water on.  He then proceeded toquickly strip down.  A considerable time later, one of the Rumpus Room patronsdecided that it was time to play a new videogame.  He searched for furtherdisks, but could find none.  "Oh well, I'll go ask Rumpus," said Mike as hestrolled over the the bathroom door.  HE'S BEEN IN THERE AN AWFUL LONG TIME,Mike thought to himself.  "Hey, Rumpus!  Are you still in there?  We need somemore disks.  Where are they?"  No answer.  "Rumpus?!?"  Again, no answer.  "Canyou hear me?" asked Mike as he pounded on the door.  For the final time, noanswer.  I BETTER GO IN SO HE CAN HEAR ME BETTER, Mike thought.  He fumbled fora credit card out of his wallet.  Carefully slipping in past the doorknob, hewedged the lock back.  The door slipped open.  Mike was quickly opening thedoor uttering "Hey, Rumpus, where are the--"  It was at this time that helooked down to see Rumpus sitting naked on the tile floor trying to issue forthjollies with a skin mag.  Rumpus didn't hear Mike come in due to the waterpouring into the tub.  He didn't realize Mike's presence until he saw the doormove out of the corner of his squinted eye.  "UNH!  Mike, get out!" Rumpusscreamed kicking the door with his foot as far as his squaty leg would reach.The force pushed Mike into the hall where he sat aghast for a split second.  Hethen burst out laughing and stumbling back into the Rumpus Room to explain thesight he just held to everyone present.     It didn't take long for the word-of-mouth chain to get the story allaround the band hall of Elsik Senior High School.  But the tale was not limitedto that location alone.  Soon, most people in both the South and North Housesof Elsik knew of "The Rumpus."  Like we said:  A legend of a sort.  Girls wouldsay "I thought he was all right until I heard that.  I think he's gross, now!"Not that it really hurt his luck with the ladies since there was not a wholelot in the first place.THE ADVENTURES BEGIN:     Rumpus thought he was a /<-/<00L FREEK!!1!  This was the farthest thingfrom the truth.  Admittingly, he knew how to use service codes, but not muchbeyond that.  We took it upon ourselves to educate the Rumpus in the workingsof the Bell system.  This was to be a mishap doomed from the origins.     First there was talk of opening a Southwestern Bell System manhole.  "Allwe need are some crowbars!  I could open one by myself," were the first wordsto come from Rumpus on the subject.  This was found to be untrue when TheUncorruptable and The Reflex discovered each manhole lid to weigh in excess of125 pounds.  Rumpus couldn't handle this mission alone so he abandoned theidea.     Rumpus' own work could be seen all throughout Alief in the form of brokenterminal boxes and left open doors on Bell equipment.  After school one Friday,Reflex and Uncorruptable were driving by a double-door terminal box in theRumpus' neighborhood.  The Reflex glanced over at the open door and the missingspool of wire and thought it to be Rumpus' careless work which he later foundout it was.     Agent Macabre and The Reflex decided to help Rumpus learn more aboutphreaking through Beige Boxing or use of a ButtFone (R) - OctothorpeProductions.  We explained in depth how the phone worked and how Bell wouldhook up lines to terminals.  We explained the magic 7/16-inch key.  Weexplained line polarity.  We explained the proper etiquette for Beige Boxing.And most important, we explained the importance of Ninja!  Ninja is simplyNinja in the fact that when you Ninja, you make yourself hidden.  Thus, whensomeone is to yell "Ninja!" then you are to hide in the possibility that dangeris approaching.  Rumpus had a hard time understanding this last concept.  Itcould have something to due with Filipinos hating Japanese and everythingassociated with it since that is that way their parents were taught duringWorld War II:  The Sequel.  Needless to say, this would result in someconflicts that would have to be worked out later.     We started out just after dark since Rumpus could not stay out late [moreon that later].  Riding Ninja-Cycles (bicycles), we met Rumpus at his house anddeparted for a night (or at least an hour) of adrenaline and frustration.  Wefirst travelled to the back of an A.I.D.S. elementary school.  We hid ourbikes.  Reflex opened a terminal box with the wrench as Agent Macabre helpedRumpus prepare the Beige Box.  We had to take several minutes explaining thecharges of the ring and tip wires and the proper placement of the alligatorclips, but we finally managed to connect to a working phone line.  Reflexdialed the local ANI and wrote the phone number down for future reference.Then the time came when we had to decide what to do now that there was dialingto be done.  Ideas were tossed up of starting a conference or simply calling911 and having an ambulance sent to the school, but leave it to Rumpus to comeup with the idea of calling 976 phone-numbers-for-morons services.     After disembarking from the school, we rode to explore a bayou for moreboxes and cans and various places we could service Bell's equipment for them.While examinging one box near a road, a car started to approach.  "Ninja!"Agent Macabre half-whispered/half-yelled as he fell to the groung on hisstomach.  Reflex did the same.  The only figure left standing in the field nextto the bayou was that of the Rumpus.  The car drew closer.  "Ninja?  That'sstupid," Rumpus whined through his nose.  The car was now on the bridge next tothe field with its bright headlights shining on a large Rumpus standing,squinting his eyes at the bright light.  "Get the fuck down!" someone yelled atRumpus as his legs were grabbed and was pulled down forcibly against his will.The car idled for several minutes staring at the field looking for furthermovement before it rolled on to either call the police or go on about its ownbusiness.  Should have set a car trap!     We rode back to Rumpus' house in disappointment and disgrace at a failureto reform the Rumpus.  We didn't give up hope for him, though.THE NIGHT LIFE:     We decided it was time for Rumpus to have a social life despite hiswell-known nocturnal activities.  It was agreed upon to try again with theRumpus and to try to get him to socialize with females his age.  We decided totake him to a popular young-adult club known as Club Soda.  Reflex and AgentMacabre arrived at the Rumpus Room on a Friday night at 8:00 P.M.  On the wayto the club several discoveries were made.  Rumpus couldn't stay out later than9 P.M. and was shocked to learn that we were planning on staying out until 1A.M.  He actually would obey such an early time to be in set by his parents.We thought this to be no problem since we would simply Shanghai him and keephim out later against his will.     When we arrived at Club Soda, Rumpus informed us that he only broughtalong $2 when the cover charge was $7 due to a special concert.  Agent Macabrehad enough money to pay only his own way in and couldn't loan money to Rumpus.Reflex had enough money to pay for Rumpus' way in, but it would leave him withno excess money with which to play pool or buy drinks with.     We stumbled back into the car to take Rumpus back home to ask for somemore money from his father.  After driving him all the way back home, Rumpuswhines and decides not to go back to Club Soda.  So much for a social life.THE PRESENT:     Rumpus has since moved to a large Northern city for reasons claimed to bethe change of occupational location for his father.  This is not the realreason believed in the Omnipotent_Foundation.  We believe it to be so thatnobody would know about the Rumpus' history and he would not be harassed anymore.  It is only a matter of time before Omnipotent will contact his newacquaintances, though.     He has not managed well in his new location.  Riding to the tennis courtsone day four black youths yelled something about Rumpus looking funny on hisbicycle.  Having no real intelligence or sense of self-preservation, Rumpusreplied by yelling, "Oh yeah?  Well, I bet I'm richer than you are!"  He waschased for five blocks before he was last heard from.RUMPUS -- THE INTERVIEW:     The following is an interview conducted with Rumpus over the telephone.The "O" represents the statements of a member of Omnipotent, Inc.  The "R"represents the reply by the Rumpus.O:  Hello, is Rumpus there?R:  Oh, hi, Jason and Rob.O:  So, what is life like in Chicago, Rumpus?R:  Well, I don't have any friends, yet; but my cousin is going to introduce me    to some girls later on today.O:  Sure...But are they going to know that case history of the Rumpus?R:  Unh!  You aren't going to start talking about that again, are you?O:  [Simulated perverse sounds.]R:  Unh!!!  --CLICK--     And so that was the end of the interview.LOOSE ENDS:     And so this concludes our little excursion into the world of theencounters with the Rumpus.
