This arrangement also serves to make the unithighly directional as sound other than that arriving at the mouth of the tubesarrives at the mic in an out-of-phase condition and cancels itself out.     With this easily constructed device it is possible (under idealconditions) to pick up conversations several HUNDRED feet away, in fact,reports of recording conversations up to 30 yards away THROUGH A CLOSED WINDOWhave been made...     The device is quite easy to construct:  First get together the followingmaterials:[1]  56' of 3/8" outside diameter aluminum tubing (hardware stores)[2]  1 sensitive amplifier with operating paraphenalia[3]  1 sensitive microphone element -- use either a good condenser or a     crystal, as their outputs tend to be a bit higher than their dynamic     counterparts.[4]  1 funnel[5]  Assorted small hardware     Cut the tubing into 37 pieces ranging from 1" through 36" in one inchdivisions.  Now bundle them together symmetrically with one end flush (asshown).  As you assemble them, blue them together in several places to assurethey remain in the state you have put them in (were it only so easy withpeople...).                                      OOO                                     OOOOO                                    OOOOOOO                                   OOOOOOOOO                                   OOOOOOOOO                                   OOOOOOOOO                                    OOOOOOO                                     OOOOO                                      OOO                              Flush ends of tubes     Take the funnel and fit it around the flush end of the tube bundle.  Beingastute enough to read this, I am sure you will notice the tubes do not exactlyfit into the funnel.  At this realization, take a small hammer and beat thefunnel to nearly as possible.  Now fill the remaining spaces with a good rubberbased caulking compound.     The microphone element is placed in the neck of the funnel (with a rubbergrommet if it is small enough to fit up into the neck -- otherwise set it intothe other end of the neck before caulking the tubing in place).  Glue the micinto place and caulk any air space around it.     Run the microphone wires out the neck of the funnel, glue in place, andalso caulk to give it a closed, fairly air invincible seal around the entireunti.  If you really feel up to it, fiberglass resin can be used instead ofcaulking compound.                             m    ###\                             i    ### \                             c    ###  \                                  ###   \_________#                             e    ###             #______ wire                             l => ###    funnel   #                             e    ###    _________#                             m    ###   /         ^                             e    ###  /       grommet                             n    ### /                             t    ###/     Run the output wires to your amplifier and place the entire unit on somesort of support, a camera tripod being ideal.  (Need I remind you to checkmatching impedances?).  The unit should be aimed at the subject and then pannedabout for maximum volume (sound does not travel in a straight line, but mayvary with wind, etc).     If wind noise overrides your target noise you can place a piece ofcheesecloth across the end of the unit.  If a particularly difficult noiseinterferes with your pick-up you can often plug up the tube(s) carrying thisnoise with a cork.     Good hunting, avoid paranoid people who may feel your rifle mic more thanresembles the real thing...                          Coming soon from Omnipotent:                          =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=                                 THE BLITZ BOX!                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     This will keep someone connected to your phone line for as long as youwant.
