It can be used in place of potassium chlorate.MATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[1] 2 carbon or lead rods (1 in. diameter X 5 in. long)    - Dry cell batteries (2-1/2 in. diameter X 7 in. long) or plumbing supply      store[2] Salt or, ocean water    - Grocery store or ocean[3] Sulfuric acid, diluted    - Motor vehicle batteries[4] Motor vehicle[5] Water[6] 2 wires, 16 gauge (3/64 in. diameter approx.), 6 ft. long, insulated[7] Gasoline[8] 1 gallon glass jar, wide mouth (5 in. diameter X 6 in. high approx.)[9] Sticks[10] String[11] Teaspoon[12] Trays[13] Trays[14] Cup[15] Heavy cloth[16] Knife[17] Large flat pan or trayPROCEDURE=-=-=-=-=[1] Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 liters (3 quarts)    of water.[2] Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously for 5    minutes.[3] Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the 2 wires.[4] With knife and sticks shape 2 strips of wood 1 X 1/8 X 1-1/2.  Tie the wood    strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 inches apart.                                  ---      ---                                  ! !      ! !                                  ! !------! !                                  ! !^wood^! !                                  ! !------! !                                  ! !^wood^! !                                  ---      ---                    Tie so the rods are 1-1/2 inches apart.[5] Connect the rods the battery in a motor vehicle (car) with the insulated    wire.[6] Submerge 4-1/2 in. of the rods into the salt water solution with the wires    still exposed to the air.[7] With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine.  Depress the    accellerator approximately 1/5 of its full travel.[8] Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours; then,    shut it down for 2 hours.[9] Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level of    the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.CAUTION:  This arrangement employs voltages which may be dangerous to~~~~~~~~  personnel.  Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running.[10] Shut off the engine.  Remove the rods from the glass jar and disconnect     wire leads from the battery.[11] Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray,     leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.[12] Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room temperature     (approx. 16 hours).  The residue is approximately 60% or more sodium     chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive ingredient.                    ---------------------------------------
