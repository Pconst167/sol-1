This was discovered by Nobel (yes, the man they named the 'PEACE' prize after), and is a very primitive form of plastique, as we know it today.  It is made by mixing a small amount of nitrocellulose (nitrated sawdust) with a larger amount of nitroglycerin.  This creates a stiff, plastic substance which has power as an explosive greater than either of its ingredients.  A person attempting to make this should use 92 percent nitroglycerin and 9 percent nitrocellulose, and PRAY!  If you don't want to mess with making nitrocellulose and have access to guncotton, it can be substituted. ONLY MAKE THIS STUFF IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH EXPLOSIVES.
