This should be done for 35 minutes.5) After nitration, the acids are washed away, and the cotton is washed in   boiling water five times, each time for 25 minutes.  The cotton is given   several tests with litmus paper.  If the litmus test proves that there is   still some acid present, a 2 percent solution of sodium bicarbonate should   neutralize whatever is left.  This is important, since any remaining acid   acts as an impurity to make the explosive unstable.
