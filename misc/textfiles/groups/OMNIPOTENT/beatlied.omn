S. for short).     The polygraph test was invented by William Moulton Marston, who was,strangely enough, also the creator of the Wonder Woman comic strip (under thename Charles Moulton).  The standard polygraph records only three distinctvital signs.  A blood-pressure.  Wires attached to the fingers measure changesin electrical resistance of the skin due to sweating.  Rubber straps around thetorso measure the breathing rate.  This information is displayed as foursquiggles on a moving strip of graph paper.     Whether or not you believe a polygraph provides useful information (mostpsychologists have their doubts), there is a good chance you'll be asked totake a polygraph test.  The vast majority of lie-detector tests areadministered for employee screening -- "Have you been using the WATS line forpersonal calls?" and so forth -- not for police work.  In 'A Tremor In theBlood:  Uses and Abuses of the Lie Detector' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1981),polygraph critic David Thoreson Lykken estimates that as many as one millionpolygraph examinations are performed on Americans each year.  In criminal caseshowever, even the manifestly innocent may be asked to take a polygraph test.All Yakima County, Washington, rape victims are required to take the test;refusal means the case will not be prosecuted.     At best, all the polygraph can indicate is a heightened emotional reactionto a question.  It cannot specify what kind of an emotional reaction.Polygraphers try to design question formats so guilt-induced nervousness willbe the only emotional invoked and so the subject's reaction to relevantquestions can be compared to other, "control" questions.THE LIE CONTROL TEST~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     This is the question format used in most police investigations.  Itusually starts with a card trick devised by two pioneer polygraphers, John E.Reid and F. E. Inbau.     The polygrapher hooks the subject to the polygraph and takes out a deck ofcards.  The polygrapher tells the subject that he must "calibrate" thepolygraph with a simple test.  He fans the deck and asks the subject to selecta card.  The subject is told to look at the card but not to show it or mentionits name.  The polygrapher tells the subject to answer "no" to every questionasked about the card.  "Is it a black card?" the polygrapher asks.  "Is it ahigh card?" and so on.  After each "no" the polygrapher scrutinizes thetracings and fiddles with the dials.  If the no answer is incorrect, thepolygrapher disagrees.  The field is soon narrowed to one card -- and it is thecorrect card.     Needless to say, the polygrapher uses a trick deck.  The point is tofoster confidence in the machine.  After identifying the card, the polygraphercomments that the subject's reactions are particularly easy to read and seguesinto the interrogation.     Three types of questions are used in a lie-control test.  The entire listis read to the subject well in advance of the test.  The start of a typicalinterrogation might run like this:  1. Is you name Sarah Elkins?  2. Is Paris the capital of France?  3. Have you ever failed to report more than $50 of tip, gambling or gift     income on a single year's tax return?  4. Is this apple red?  5. Do you have any idea why the cash receipts for the last quarter are about     $22,000 in error?  6. Is there something important that you did not mention on your job     application?  7. Have you ever been embezzling from the company?     The first question is always irrelevant to the matter being investigated.It has to be because many subjects get nervous on the first question no matterwhat.  Other irrelevant questions are asked throughout the interrogation(questions 2 and 4 in the sample list).  If the subject gives any questions toprovide a yardstick for evaluating responses to the relevant questions.Actually, the irrelevant questions are there to give the subject's vital signstime to return to normal.  They aren't the control questions.     Questions 5 and 7 in the list above are relevant questions -- the onlyquestions the examiner is really interested in.  The relevant questions areasked in several different wordings during the test.     Questions 3 and 6 are control questions.  In the pretest discussion of thequestions, the polygrapher explains that it is helpful to throw in a few"general honesty" questions.  Whoever committed the serious crime, the spielgoes, probably committed less serious crimes in the past.  Hence the inclusionof questions about tax cheating, lying on the job applications, stealing as achild, etc.     The polygrapher affects the attitude that it would be damaging indeed toadmit any such indiscretions.  Frequently this scares the subject intoadmitting minor crimes.  In that case, the polygrapher frowns and agrees torewrite the question.  Should the subject concede failing to report eightydollars in gambling winnings, question 3 might be changes to "Have you everfailed to report more than a hundred dollars of tip, gambling, or gift incomeon a single years's tax return?"  If necessary, several of the controlquestions may be reworded before the test -- always so that the subject willbe able to give the "honest" response.     In reality, the whole point of each working question is to manufacture alie.  It is the secret working premise of polygraphers that everyone commitsthe minor transgressions that are the subject of the usual control questions.All the subject's denials on the control questions are assumed to be lies.  Thepolygraph tracings during these "lies" establish a base line for interpretingthe reaction to the relevant questions.     The reason for rewriting some control questions is so a candid subjectwill not admit to minor crimes on the test.  That would be telling the truth,and the polygrapher wants the subject to lie.  The control questions areintentionally broad.  Even if a question is reworded to exclude the confessedinstance, it is assumed that any denial must be a lie.     The rationale for the lie-control test goes like this:  The honest subjectwill be worried about the control questions.  He'll know that he has committedsmall transgressions or suspect that he must have, even if he can't rememberthem.  So he'll be afraid that the machine will detect his deception on the"general honesty" questions (especially in view of its success with the cardtrick).  That would be embarrassing at least, and it might throw suspicion onhim for the larger crime.  In contrast, the relevant questions should be lessthreatening to the honest subject.  He knows he didn't commit the crimes theyrefer to.     The guilty person, on the other hand, should have far more to fear fromthe relevant questions.  If the machine can detect lying on the relevant issue,it matters little that it might also implicate him in petty matters.     By this hypothesis, an innocent person should have greater polygraphicresponse to the control questions than to the relevant questions.  The guiltypattern is just the reverse:  Greater response to the relevant questions.This, at any rate, is what polygraphers look for when the machine is switchedon.THE RELEVANT-CONTROL TEST~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     The relevant-control test is the type used for most employee screenings.Thus it is the most common type of examination.  The interrogation consistsonly of irrelevant and relevant questions.  As with the lie-control test, thefirst question and a few others are irrelevant.  The relevant questions usuallytest workplace honesty:  "Have you ever taken home office supplies for personaluse?" "Have you ever clocked in for someone else?"     The premise is that no one will lie about everything.  So if a few of therelevant questions produce heightened responses, they are presumed to be thequestions on which the subject is lying.  Unfortunately, there is no ambiguousway of deciding how much response is indicates a lie.  Most psychologists agreethat the relevant-control test is a poor test of deception.     The Reid/Inbau card trick is eliminated from employee screenings:  Thereis too great of a chance of coworkers comparing notes and discovering thateveryone picked the ace of spades.HOW TO BEAT THE LIE-DETECTOR~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~     To the extent that the polygraph works at all, it works because peoplebelieve it does.  Many criminals confess during polygraph examinations.  Manyemployees are more honest for fear of periodic screenings.  But a dummypolygraph that hummed and scribbled preprogrammed tracings would be no less inthese instances.     David Thoreson Lykken estimates that lie-control polygraph tests are about70 percent accurate.  (Remember, though, that choosing "heads" or "tails" of aflipped coin can be accurate 50 percent of the time.)  Accuracy of 70 percentis not impressive, but it is high enough to talk meaningfully of beating apolygraph test.     Just by having read this far, you stand a greater chance of beating apolygraph test.  You won't be wowed by the card demonstration.  You realizethat the polygraph's powers are limited.  There are two additional techniquesfor beating the polygraph.  The more obvious is to learn how to repressphysiologic responses to stressful questions.  Some people are good at thisone; others are not.  Most people can get better by practicing with apolygraph.  Of course, this training requires a polygraph, and polygraphs areexpensive.     The opposite approach is to pick out the control questions in the pretestdiscussion and exaggerate reactions to these questions during the test.  Whenthe control-question responses are greater than the relevant-questionresponses, the polygrapher must acquit the subject.     Because breathing is one of the parameters measures, taking a deep breathand holding it will record as an abnormal response.  Flexing the arm musclesunder the cuff distorts the blood-pressure reading.  But a suspiciouspolygrapher may spot wither ruse.     A more subtle method is to hide a tack in one shoe.  Stepping on the tackduring the control questions produces stress reactions with no outward signs offidgeting.  Biting the tongue forcefully also works.  Can you imagine thepolygrapher's response to the "Is this apple red?" question when you say "red"and the machine starts going crazy?  He'd shit his pants!_______________________________________________________________________________
