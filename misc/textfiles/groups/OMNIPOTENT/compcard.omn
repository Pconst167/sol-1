Well, with this file you will learn how to get as much as you wantwithout even having to pay a dime.  The technique you are about to beintroduced to is known as Carding.  It is using someone else's credit card.     Here is how it works, you get someone's credit card number and then use itto order through a mail-order firm.  Carding can be broken up into basicallythree sections:[1] Obtaining the credit card number.[2] Placing the order over the phone.[3] Receiving and picking up the package you ordered.Step [1]:  Getting the number=============================     There are many different ways to obtain a credit card number.  One of themost popular ways is what is known as trashing.  This is simply going throughthe trash of large store looking for the carbon copies that store make afterringing up a purchase on a card.  Another way is by calling a person while youpose as a representitive of their bank.  Or you can also copy it down if yousee someone carelessly flip out their card where you can see it.     Trashing may be accomplished one of two ways.  The first method is to gointo a store and start looking through whatever they carry.  Start moving yourway slowly to the cashier's stand.  When you get there, throw something in (abag or a piece of paper).  Next, exclaim that you didn't mean to throw awaythat particular object.  Reach in the basket and get your object.  Search forsome carbon copies.  If you find some, put them in your pockets.  If you threwa bag the the garbage, just put them in there, it is much easier since carbonshave a tendency to smudge, so be careful how you handle them.  The secondmethod of trashing is by making a dumpster run at night.  Go, at night, to thestore after a busy day with lots of customers.  Try to hit the stores with therich customers.  In other words, don't go trashing at K-Mart.  Now, take somelarge garbage bags with you or something that you can carry the carbons inwithout smudging them.  Jump into a dumpster and start searching for some largegarbage bags or for just some loose carbons.  Cut open the bags with your razorand ransack them for carbons.  If you see security coming, jump out and runlike Hell.  Or, if security catches you, try to get rid of the carbons withoutthem seeing you, and tell them that you were looking for some binders forschool.  Once, when The Uncorruptable and I were searching for some new cards,we decided to check out the dumpsters at the local mall.  When we were checkingout the dumpsters for Saks Fifth Avenue, we noticed that they could only bereached by going through the store for they were not open to the sky.  Theentrance to them was surrounded by a cage.  All out of luck?  Not yet, nevergive up hope.  We managed to reach under the fence and grab many carbons thathad been spilled with other garbage as the bags tore.  Out of close to 50carbons, only one was an American Express.  Not bad, because American Expresscards have at least a $5000 limit on them and they don't give them to poorpeople.     Another way of obtaining the number without leaving home is by posing as aperson from someone's bank.  Look through the phone book for some people thatlive in the rich part of town.  Call them up and proceed as follows:YOU:  Hello, my name is Brad Moreland, I represent Citibank Customer Service      and Management.  I am calling to notify you that your credit card limit      has been raised to $5,000.SUCKER:  But my limit has always been $10,000.YOU:  Just one moment.  [Make it sound like you are typing something in on a      computer.]  We must have a computer error.  Could you read off the      embossed number on your card, please?SUCKER:  Ok, one second and I'll get it.Boy, will they ever.  You can elaborate on this by asking if you can put themon hold while you call Computer Management Division.  In other words, pour onthe bullshit.     The final way of obtaining a card number is simply to write one down whenyou see one.  This is good in stores or restaurants when you are waiting inline.  Always carry a paper and small pencil with you.  Develop a type ofshorthand you can understand.  You will always find a situation where you wantsomething to write on whether it be credit cards or some 7-digits.     What do you do when you have some carbon paper.  Well, if you hold it upto the light, you can see everything you need:  [1] Name, [2] Card Number, [3]Expiration date.  But, you now need to get out your phone book and look up thisperson in the phone book.  Get their address and zip code.  You will need thisbecause when you are ordering, the company will ask you for the billing addressand you NEED to give it to them.  This is because when they go to check thecard and the billing address doesn't match, they won't ship your stuff to you.If the billing address DOES match the one you gave them, they won't check itany further except to make sure the card itself isn't stolen (which it isn'tbecause you only took the number, not the card).     You may need to check out the limit on the card to make sure that youdon't go over the limit.  This can be accomplished by calling up a credit cardcheck, like they do in the stores.  You probably wonder, "Well, where do I getthe number for this thing?"  This is where you need your paper and pencil.  Gointo a store and when you are checking out, look around for a number and anauthorization [merchant] code.  They are usually around the phone.  When youcall they will ask for the mechant number, the card number, the expirationdate, and also the amount of purchase.  Look in the magazine and add up theprice of all the stuff you want to order.  I suggest that you don't order anyamount of over $1,000 on a VISA or a MasterCard.  If you have an AmericanExpress, they have at least a $5000 limit.  The only bad thing about AmericanExpress is that they aren't accepted widely like MasterCard and VISA, but timesare changing.  One good number to check VISA's and MasterCards on is (713) 840-8010.Step [2]:  Placing the Order============================     Now find the 800 number in the magazine and get ready to place the order.Go to a phone booth and call up the place.  Usually they will have an 800number to order so you don't need any money.  Act calm.  Don't sound like alittle kid.  And most of all, don't act dumb, get carried away, and order theirwhole inventory.  Remember that they won't take you seriously if you order toomuch merchandise.  The whole idea is not to order it to your house.  Find anempty house and trash the FOR SALE sign.  Now give them the address of thehouse.  Try to have the shipment sent UPS.  UPS is good for their style andI'll explain it below.  Have it either shipped Blue Label (2-day) if the orderis expensive, or Red Label (1-day overnight) if it isn't too expensive.  I'veheard of them being ordered to P.O. Boxes before since you just give the peopleat the post office a false name, usually they don't ask for a forwardingaddress.  Also, if you can con some loser into doing this, make sure he doesn'tknow your name or number or where you live.  Tell him that you will be sendingsome stuff over to his house.  Usually it would be best if you told him youwould get him something cheap under $50.  When he receives the package tell himto call you.  Send someone over to pick up the package from him, let him keepthe cheap crap you got for him and get away from there and never talk to himagain.  This way, he will take the heat from the Feds and you don't have toworry.Step [3]:  Receiving and Pick-Up================================     Now for the pick-up.  Give the place an address for an empty house likeone that's for sale or an abandoned house.  Just make sure that the house yougive them does look lived in.  If there is a FOR SALE sign, don't forget totrash it around in the back yard or keep it, they can come in handy sometimes.     Put a note on the door on the day they said it would arrive saying thatyou are sorry you couldn't be home and for them to leave it on the front step.Now, sign the note with the card holders name and put on the card that if theyneed a signature, they can take the note.  UPS will always take the note forthe signature.     It is usually a good idea to watch and see when they drop it off.  Whenthey do drop it off, don't start acting like an asshole and run over to thehouse.  Take it calm and easy and then go on home and wait till night.     If the UPS man takes the package to a neighbors house, then just go totheir house with the note the UPS man left on the door and claim the package asyours and split.     Now that it's night, sneak over to your drop at about two AM.  Wear darkclothes and pretend you're playing James Bond or something like that.  Go tothe drop and get your package.  Take it back and hide it somewhere near yourhouse real good.  This way, when the Feds come knocking on doors, you won'thave what they're looking for.  Wait for it to cool down and then bring yourpackage inside, take it out, and get rid of the evidence by burning the box andshit.  Remember that only a moron that doesn't value his freedom would send itback if it were broken or something.     Now you know about Carding.  The way to obtain merchandise without paying.Just remember that you have now commited a federal crime with a penalty of upto 10 years in prison and a $15,000 fine.A few brief notes:==================     If the place asks for a phone number when you are ordering, give them aBBS number that is always busy.  You can place the oder from home, just don'tcall their 800 number from home because I have had them trace me before from an800 number.  If you want to call from home, call through an extender to theircustomer service number.     Make sure that you ask them for a date as when the shit is going to bedelivered.  That way, you'll know when to check the drop.     Carding is wonderful!  It is the way to get the stuff that you have onlystared at and dreamed of by going over and over in a catalog.  It is the poorman's way of being rich.  Let's face it, at today's prices, no one can affordmuch.  Carding is like making money for nothing as a song says.  One suggestionis to order gold coins from some shop, look in the back of Smithsonian'sMagazine.  And then you can turn the coins into cash for the current runningprice.  All that you have seen in this G-phile is not bullshit, because I nowhave $400 in books from Paladin Press, a Sony D-7 compact disc player, a Casio2-1/2 inch color LCD portable television (they give those things long names), a1200 baud modem, and $500 in cash.                                   BE CAREFUL                    =======================================
