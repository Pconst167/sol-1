It may be prepared by distilling a mixture ofpotassium nitrate and concentrated sulfuric acid.MATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[1] Potassium nitrate (2 parts by volume)    - Drug store    - Improvised (see one of my other files on the subject)[2] Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 part by volume)    - Motor vehicle batteries    - Industrial plants[3] 2 bottles or ceramic jugs (narrow necks are preferable)[4] Pot or frying pan[5] Heat source (wood, coal, or charcoal)[6] Tape (paper, electrical, masking, etc. but NOT cellophane)[7] Paper or ragsIMPORTANT:  If sulfuric acid is obtained from a motor vehicle battery,~~~~~~~~~~  concentrate it by boiling UNTIL white fumes appear.  Do not inhale            fumes (ahhh!).NOTE:  The amount of nitric acid produced is the same as the amount of~~~~~  potassium nitrate.  Thus, for 2 tablespoons of nitric acid, use 2       tablespoons of potassium nitrate and 1 tablespoonful of concentrated       sulfuric acid.PROCEDURE=-=-=-=-=[1] Place dry potassium nitrate in bottle or jug.  Add sulfuric acid.  Do not    fill more than 1/4 full.  Mix until paste is formed.CAUTION:  Sulfuric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is~~~~~~~~  spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also          dangerous and should not be inhaled.  This warning is for your good,          not mine.[2] Wrap paper or rags around the necks of the 2 bottles.  Securely tape necks    of bottles together.  Be sure bottles are flush against each other and that    there are no air spaces.                             # = potassium nitrate                          +-------\         /-------+                          !        \       /        !                          !         \_____/         !                          !          _____          !                          !#########/  ^  \         !                          !########/   !   \        !                          +-------/  paper  \-------+[3] Support bottles on rocks or cans so that the empty bottle is slightly lower    than the bottle containing paste so that nitric acid that is formed in    recieving bottle will not run into other bottle.[4] Build fire in pot or frying pan.[5] Gently heat bottle containing mixture by moving fire in and out.  As red    fumes begin to appear periodically pour cool water over empty recieving    bottle.  Nitric acid will begin in form in the recieving bottle.CAUTION:  Do not overheat or wet bottle containing mixture or it may shatter.~~~~~~~~  As an added precaution, place bottle to be heated in heat resistant          container filled with sand or gravel.  Heat this outer container to          produce nitric acid.[6] Continue the above process until no more red fumes are formed.  If the    nitric acid formed in the recieving bottle is not clear (cloudy) pour it    into cleaned bottle and repeat Steps 2 - 6.CAUTION:  Nitric acid will burn skin and destroy clothing.  If any is spilled,~~~~~~~~  wash it away with a large quantity of water.  Fumes are also          dangerous and should not be inhaled.  Nitric acid should be kept away          from all combustibles and should be kept in a sealed ceramic or glass          container.     I, THE REFLEX, will assume FULL responsibility for ANY damages caused bythis G-file.  Of course, you are fucked in the head if you think you can findme to prosecute me.
