A one-man burst of textfile-writing, The Reflex created file after file
on all ranges of subjects, ranging from Anarchy and Phreaking to transcriptions
of books on revenge and original fiction. His hallmarks were good spelling,
nice formatting, and intense hate of a guy named 'Rumpus'.
<P>
The Reflex could always be depended upon for his high-quality work.
