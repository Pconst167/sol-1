As with all the rest of the explosive formulas, it seems everyonehas his own recipe, which he claims to be the best.  I have collected 11 of thesafer, more functional methods of preparing gunpowder.  The most importantthing to remember when dealing with black powder is its incredible sensitivityto sparks.  Rember that all the formulas provided are in weight rather thanvolume percentage.Formulas for Black Powder:--------------------------1) potassium percholorate 69.2   sulfur                 15.4   charcoal               15.42) potassium chlorate     75   charcoal               12.5   sulfur                 12.53) potassium nitrate      70.4   sulfur                 19.4   sodium sulfate         10.24) potassium nitrate      79   sulfur                  3   straw charcoal         185) potassium nitrate      64   sulfur                 12   lamp black              7   sawdust                176) potassium nitrate      79   sulfur                  3   antimony sulfate       187) potassium nitrate      50   ammonium perchlorate   25   sulfur                 12.5   powdered charcaol      12.58) potassium nitrate      37.5   starch                 37.5   sulfur                 18.75   antimony powder         5.99) barium nitrate         75   sulfur                 12.5   charcoal               12.510) guanidine nitrate     49    potassium nitrate     40    charcoal              1111) sodium peroxide       67    sodium thiosulphate   33     When preparing black powder for use in firearms, it is important to keepin mind that these formulas are more powerful than the ordinary potassiumnitrate gunpowder, and for that reason smaller quantities should be used.  Thecorrect amount can only be dicovered by trial-and-error experimentation, butcaution must be taken to prevent overloading.     Although black powder is one of the safest explosives, is hasdisadvantages:  It is extremely sensitive to sparks; and it leaves a muddyresidue in gun barrels, which necessitates frequent cleaning.  The advantage ofsmokeless powder is that it is an extremely stable high-powered explosive inthe low-explosive class, which gives off only gaseous products upon explosion.The first type of smokeless powder used by the army was basicallynitrocellulose with a small amount of diphenylamine, for stabilizer.  Smokelesspowder is perhaps the safest of any explosive compound, and for that reason isextremely popular today.
