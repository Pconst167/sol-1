Well there are many great ways to get revenge againstscum of the bucket places like this.  Here is where you can learn some ways andseek inspiration for further activities.1) When you first walk into a restaurant and they ask you how many people will   be at dinner, say that you are having an office party and that about 50-75   poeple will be coming in.  It is better to call and reserve this.2) Get up and go to the bathroom as often as you can.  This will piss them off.   Once inside the bathroom, you have limitless possiblities.  Make sure that   you have a full bladder for this one.  First go into all of the stalls and   piss on all the toilet paper.  Piss up and down the walls.  After pissing up   the stalls, go over to the sink.  See the contraption on the wall full of   soap?  Well remove the top and empty your bladder into it.  If you can, stir   it up or shake it up.  I've done this before and then seen people come in   and wash their hands and face.  A real riot!  Next whip out your magic   marker and go back into the stalls.  Write such shit as:  "Brad Moreland is   a Dick that likes to give head!  Call him at (713) 487-0351."  Next give an   illustration to go along with it such as this:                                      ___                                     / ! \                                     !___!                                     !. .!                                     !., !                                     ! ,.!                                     ! , !                                     !., !                                  __ ! ,.! __                                 /.,\! , !/.,\                                 !,.,!___!.,.!                                 \__/     \__/                              BRAD MORELAND RULES!   If there are any empty toilets then fill them to the rim with toilet paper.   It is interesting to see the water fill up the bathroom as you run out in   laughter.3) Next order as much shit as possible and then "remember" that you have an   important engagement as they bring all the shit out.4) Need some credit cards?  After some assholes leave, they forget to take   their carbons with them and leave them sitting on the table.  Help yourself,   it will have the store authorization number on it for some checking   purposes.5) Low on money?  Help yourself to the tips that idiots leave for "good   service."  One night I got nearly $45 from 3 different restaurants in the   local mall.6) Food Phun!  So the shit, er...I mean food has arrived, eh?  Well you aren't   really going to pay for it, are you?  If you haven't collected your tips yet   then whip out your official Marvin Zindler Roach Droppings in a Bag(c) and   pour it all over your food.  Demand to see the manager and then start   bitching about how you expect good service for the price you are paying.   Threaten to tell the Board of Health and report them for that.  Also, have   some rat droppings and urine ready.  Live roaches are a must, all you have   to do is release one on your plate after you ate all that you want (don't   eat it all).  Next release the roach on your food and call the manager.7) Ever consider starting a food fight casually in a nice restaurant.  Once   when I was in Chili's and there weren't many people, I picked up a chip with   some sauce on it and tossed it over the divider between sections.  Next I   heard a loud "SHIT!"  And the guy came around the corner as I split.8) Need some utensils for your house?  Well, as you are leaving, grab some   knives and forks and put them in your pockets.  Salt and pepper shakers are   easy to put in your pants too if you need them.9) BB's!  Get one of those cartons of about a thousand BB's.  Open it up and   then spread them evenly throughout the restaurant.  It's funny to watch five   waiters all tripping and dropping food and glass and blood...10) Firecrackers!  These are halarious if you pay by cash.  When you are about    to leave, just light a string of blackcats with a fuse that would give you    enough time to pay and get out, or if you already payed.  It will scare the    shit out of everyone if you are still in there and you yell:  "He has a gun    everyone get down!"  Watch people flee and panic as they try to get out the    doors while the waiters are tripping over each other and breaking things.11) Hide everything!  This so when the people come to clean up your table they    won't find a mess, but the next group of people will as they sit down and    put their feet in your lasagna under the table.12) Order 50 different things and keep having them sent back to the kitchen    because you "didn't want mayonaisse on it."  Or you "wanted cheese on it."    This will confuse the waiters and cooks.13) As the waiters bring you your food and say "I believe you had the Veal    Cutlet?"  Say plainly, "No, sorry, I ordered blah blah!"14) Take the linen napkins into the bathrooms and procede to relieve yourself    in them.  On your way out just DROP it on someone's table as you pass by.    They will do one of two things.  1:  Have a shit themselves.  2:  Faint!15) Screw the caps off the salt and pepper shakers and then turn them upside-    down carefully.  When the waiters come to clean it up, they lift the    shakers and it drops all over the table and they have another mess to clean    up.                                   Have Phun!                     And remember that life is just a game!_______________________________________________________________________________
