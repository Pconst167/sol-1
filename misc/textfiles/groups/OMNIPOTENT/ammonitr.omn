As a matter             of fact, I'll let you sue me and I'll pay.  All you have to do is             tell your lawyer, "It's all THE REFLEX's fault."  I'll see you             when you get out of the institution.     Some Militants who don't have much dynamite use ammonium nitrate.  Thiscan be bought by anyone at $3.75 for an 80 pound bag.  It is fertilizer.     Ammonium nitrate explodes at rates up to 14,000 feet per second.  It isroughly compared to dynamite having 60% nitro.     The fertilizer grade Militants use is mixed with motor oil at the ratio ofone pint of oil to 8-1/2 pounds of ammonium nitrate.  This has to be detonatedwith a stick of gelatin dynamite [I didn't say all was easy.  Try to findanother file about that crap.].     Purified ammonium nitrate can be detonated with a number six dynamite cap.The pure stuff can be bought at chemical supply houses or the fertilizer gradecan be purified with distilled wood alcohol.     Put several pounds of fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate in a pan.  Pour inenough wood alcohol (methanol) to cover the fertilizer.  Then stir it until alot of it has dissolved.  Next, let it set for a few minutes to allow theimpurities to settle to the bottom along with the undissolved ammonium nitrate.     Another pan is set on some pieces of dry ice for the next step.  Dry icecan be found in the business section of the phone book under "Dry Ice."  Lockercompanies will sell it to anyone, cheaply and in small amounts.     The dissolved ammonium nitrate is poured into the cold pan.  This is donecarefully so as to leave the impurities and undissolved ammonium nitratebehind.     The dry ice causes the purified ammonium nitrate to precipitate out of thesolution in crystals.  When no more crystals are formed they are removed fromthe alcohol.     The alcohol is then poured back into the other pan and stirred to dissolveany ammonium nitrate left undissolved.  After setting a few minutes thesolution is again poured off the dregs and the dregs are thrown away.  When thelast batch of crystals is removed, the alcohol can be stored and reused.     The dry ice is simply frozen carbon dioxide and its fumes are harmlessunless they are enough to replace the air.  Don't handle the dry ice with yourbare hands [unless you are into pulling your skin off to the bone] as its coldwill cause blisters.     In order for pure ammonium nitrate to be detonated by a dynamite cap, itmust be very dry.  Spread it out under a heat lamp ir in thte sun.  Whencompletely dry, store it in tightly closed plastic bags.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------     You got here on just the right day!  For a limited time only, we will beoffering this *BONUS* file to you free with the above file.  That's right!  Twofiles for the price of one!  And only from Omnipotent!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------     So you don't know what to do with your ammonium nitrate once you've madeit.  You're saying to yourself, "Great!  Now I have a chemical that is supposedto blow things up, but I don't want to destroy anything [ahem?]."  Well...                              LAUGHING GAS                              =-=-=-=-=-=-                               [snicker!]     As a special treat for the dopers in the audience and since ammoniumnitrate has been on your mind for a few minutes, you might as well learn how tomake laughing gas from ammonium nitrate.     Laughing gas was one of the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little whileof inhaling the gas the patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn'tkeep from laughing.  Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.     Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This isbecause they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads wereinside.  They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.     The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot ofthe gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bagunder your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!     To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supplyhouse or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.     First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then youevaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavybrine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when adrop is put on an ice cold metal plate.     When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, breakit up and store it in a bottle.     A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tubeleading into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.     When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  Ifwhite fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.     When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Well, there you have two files in one.  No need to thank us.  Just sendall "donations" to...  [In this business, a since of humor is necessary!]Until the next one...THE REFLEX signing off as I am getting tired.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
