You can have little or no control over timing, and such devices are notorious for backfiring.  The chemical-action time-delay methods have proven to be pretty reliable.  Most of this action incorporates the amount time taken by certain solution of acid to eat its way through another substance.  The time length can be determined by the concentration of the acid and by the substance to be eaten through.Nipple Time Bomb----------------  An example of this type of chemical action is the Nipple Time Bomb, which is very effective.  One must obtain a short section of steel pipe and cap each end accordingly.  Place inside the steel pipe a stick of dynamite, and drill a quarter-inch hole at on end of the cap.  Now, into this hole you must place a small amount of potassium chlorate and gunpowder.  Now, seperatly from the pipe, take a small glass vial and fill it with a concentrated sulfuric acid solution, then stop up the end with a paper or cork stopper.  To arm the bomb, place the vial of acid upside down in the hole at the top of the pipe.  Now, when the acid has eaten its way through the stopper, it will come in contact with the potassium chlorate and gunpowder.  The mixture of these chemicals will cause a minor explosion, but it will be large enough to produce the heat necessary to detonate the dynamite.  The detonation time is usually between three and six hours.  If a solution of sulfuric acid and glycerin is used, rather than just a pure sulfuric acid, the time delay will be up to five or six days (plenty of time for you to haul ass as far away as you can so you won't be around when the Feds start looking for people).Here is a diagram:$ = Vial with Sulfuric Acid Mixture% = Potassium Chlorate# = Gunpowder                                   +--+$+--+                                   !  !$!  !                             C     !  !$!  !                             A ==> !  !%!  !                             P     !  !#!  !                                   !  +-+  !                                   +-+---+-+                                     !   !                                     !

This is very similiar to the Nipple Time Bomb, in that it relies on the same chemical action, but without the dynamite.  The procedure is very simple.  A cardboard box or iron tube is filled with a mixture of three-quarters potassium chlorate and one-quarter sugar, and then sealed. At one end a hole is made.  Into that hole is placed an inverted vial of sulfuric acid, with a paper or cork stopper, it will come into contact with the potassium chlorate-sugar mixture.  This will result in a very hot, powerful fire.Illustration:% = Vial of Sulfuric Mixture as in the above bomb$ = Cork or Paper Stopper# = Mixture of Potassium Cholrate and Sugar                                  +---+ +---+                                  !   !%!   !                                  !   !%!   !                                  !   !%!   !                                  !   !%!   !                                  !   !$!   !                                  !   +-+   !                                  !#########!                                  !#########!                                  !#########!                                  !#########!                                  !#########!                                  !#########!                                  +---------+Magnifying-Glass Bomb---------------------  The Magnifying-Glass Bomb is effective, but it has many disadvantages.  The procedure is very simple.  Take a tin can and fill three-quarters of it with highly compressed gunpowder.  Now attach to the top of the can a small magnifying glass, so that the sun's light, when magnifyed through the glass, will cause the heat necessary to detonate the charge.  This works very well, as long as it doesn't rain.Illustration:                                  Magnifying Glass                                       !                                    +-----+                             +------!     !------+                             !      +-----+      !                             !                   !                             !                   !                             !                   !                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             !%%%%%GUNPOWDER%%%%%!                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             !%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%!                             +-------------------+Alarm-Clock Time Bomb---------------------  The alarm-clock detonation method is the most accurate device, in that a person can the the exact time he wishes the bomb to explode.  It is connected in the same fashion as the other eletrical-circuit booby traps.  Wires are connected to the hammer of the bell and to the bell itself, via the blasting cap, to a dry cell.  The clock should be set to go off before the booby trap is built.  When the alarm goes off, the hammer and bell connect completing the electrical circuit and detonating the explosive.Illustration:                          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          % +---++---+ %   DYNAMITE   %                          % !  +!!+  ! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          % !  !DC!  ! %   DYNAMITE   %                          % !  !re!  ! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          % !  !yl!  ! %   DYNAMITE   %                          % !  ! l!  ! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          % !  +--+  +-- Blasting Cap %                          %%!%%%%%%%%!%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          % !        ! %   DYNAMITE   %                          % +-+----+-+ %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          %   !XXXX!   %   DYNAMITE   %                          %   !XXXX!   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          %   !XXXX!   %   DYNAMITE   %                          %   +----+   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%                          %   Clock!   %   DYNAMITE   %                          %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
