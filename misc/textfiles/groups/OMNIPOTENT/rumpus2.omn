He could make no friends so the only thing he could do was bother theones that he had left behind.  He would do this by calling them across thecountry using illegal long-distance-service codes.  Then one day a man calledsomeone that we will just call Amy claiming that her number showed up on hisbill.  She (lacking common sense) paid the fifteen dollar bill and calledRumpus demanding that he send the money.  He whined and gave in promising tosend the money.  This is his story as unexciting as it may be.The Nightmare Begins:     The alarm broke the early morning silence as the dawning sun crackedthrough the window shades.  Rumpus stumbled out of bed and turned off thealarm.  Feeling around for the light switch on the wall he found an electricoutlet instead.  This is what is believed to cause the "porcupine phenomenon"as it is called where Rumpus' hair stands straight up even when wet.  Rumpuswalked over to the mirror and rubbed his chins.  "Still no stubble," he thoughtto himself wondering when puberty was going to hit.  Then he took a step backand started modeling body-builder poses in front of the mirror trying to findsome muscles.  His mother walked in and she was impressed.  "You've got to hangup your clothes, Rumpus," she nagged in broken English.  "Unh!  All right,Mom!" was the only thing Rumpus could think of saying without getting introuble.     After taking a shower and eating his "Wheaties," Rumpus ran back in hisroom remembering that he had left his Commodore 64 on all night hackinglong-distance codes.  With an ectasy that only Rumpus could know, he turned onthe television to discover his computer had found the fatal code.  He copied itdown and ran off to school with books under his arm.     All day long he was trying to make a list of people in his mind that hecould call using his latest code.  "I could call all my girlfriends where Iused to live," he plotted to himself.  Rumpus was so busy daydreaming that hedidn't notice the changing of six periods from his first-period class.  By thetime he realized what was happening, everyone had left for the day.  Withexcitement building, he ran home and picked up the telephone receiver.The Telephone Calls:     "Hmmm, first I'll call Jennifer!" he thought with delusions of grandeurfloating around in his mousse-hardened skull.     --RING--  --RING--  "Hello?"     "Hey, Jennifer, this is Rumpus!  What's up?"     --CLICK--     "Unh!  This code must not be very good..." he pondered.  "Oh well, I'llcall Jason, now."  He tapped out the code and Agent Macabre's number.     --RING--  --RING--  "Hello?"     "Hey, Jason, this is Rumpus!"     "Oh well, I gotta go sort out my sock drawer.  Bye!"  --CLICK--     "Hello?  Hello?  I don't think this code is any good.  I'll give it onemore try."  With this, he tapped out the numbers for one Amy Somethingorother.     --RING--  --RING--  "Hello?"     "Hi, Amy, this is Rumpus!"     "Oh, hello."     "Do you still love me?" Rumpus prodded trying to get a hopeful response.     "Just like Seven-Up, Rump:  Never had, never will." she replied.     At this point Rumpus was emotionally distraught.  He thought aboutsuicide, but then thought it would be too painful.  He fished for something tosay for approximately an hour.  This was the phone call that broke the camel'sback.  Rumpus was destined for jail.The Discovery:     Somewhere not too far from the home of Beau Goltex, an unsuspectinglong-distance-company subscriber opened his bill to find many charges fortelephone calls he didn't make.  He looked over the list and found some of thecall destinations were in his area code.  He closed his eyes and picked one atrandom to call.     --RING--  --RING--  "Hello?"  Amy answered.     "Hello, your number showed up on my long-distance bill.  Do you knowanybody that lives in the 312 area code?" the confused customer asked.     With this Amy told the man just about everything that was needed to know.She told him about Rumpus and how he calls his friends using illegally obtainedcodes.  The one thing she neglected to tell him was Rumpus' name.  This was notseen as an important fact to Rumpus, though.The Panic:     The next day, Rumpus heard the news from Amy.  Rumpus was struck withfear.  "Unh!  I can't go to jail."  He made out a plan that included not usingthe codes from his house any more.  He thought that the authorities weretampering with his phone lines as he claimed he would hear clicking whenever hewould talk on the telephone.  This was later discovered to be his call-waitingservice and Rumpus was made to look like an idiot.The Fate of the Rumpus:     The following day, Rumpus skipped school in an attempt to clean his roomof any incriminating evidence.  He gathered up all of his print-outs and headedfor the garbage cans.  Two men in three-piece suits with sunglasses and littlewires running out their ears approached Rumpus as he neared the trash can.     They claimed to be poor scientists that were developing an engine thatcould run on garbage and they asked him if they could use his waste in theirexperiments.  Rumpus decided this was a good opportunity to get rid of theincriminating evidence since it would be burned and he gave it to the two men.They thanked him and stepped back into their black van with the tinted windowsand the minature satellite dish circling on top of it.     Rumpus walked back inside and fell on his bed in relief.  "I'm finally ridof that stuff" he thought to himself exhausted.  At that moment, however, therewas three loud knocks on the door.  Being the only one home Rumpus ran to thedoor and opened it.  The two men stood there along with several other men andthey had papers in their hand.     "Rumpus, you have the right to remain silent..." the first man started offas three were making their way to the door.  Rumpus kicked the door shut andthrew the deadbolt on.  He screamed, "You'll never take me alive, coppers!" ashe ran into his room and loaded the .45 he got for his birthday.     He flung the back door open and ran out of the house head-first.  Heshoved his hair into the stomach of one of the agents who fell screaming andclenching his bloody abdomen.  Rumpus saw another car pulling up.  He fired ashot through the window and killed the driver (which turned out to be hisfather).     He jumped on his Ninja motorcycle and drove off screaming something aboutkiller-codes.  This was the last that was heard from Rumpus as he was gunneddown by two Harris County Sheriff's Deputies on Highway 59 North just two milesout of Houston.  He was resisting arrest for traveling without proper lights onhis turbo scooter.[Editor's Note:  The above passage was misprinted.  Please ignore any previous information in it.  Thank you.]The Real Fate:     Nobody is really sure what really happened to Rumpus.  This wholesituation eventually blew over.     What will be Rumpus' future?  After several hours of deliberation, AgentMacabre and The Reflex decided that Rumpus will be found dead either lying byhis air conditioning unit after snorting all the freon out of it or hanging inhis closet with his penis clenched in one hand while trying a new sexualtechnique from HUSTLER magazine.[Note:  Please notice that the Rumpus has no affiliation whatsoever with Omnipotent, Incorporated.
