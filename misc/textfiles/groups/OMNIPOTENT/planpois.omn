A fewleaves in the salad aren't noticed and the victim dies without knowing why.     Rhubarb, for one, is a deadly poison.  The stalks are fine but if you eatof the leaf, you'll die.  Cooked, the leaves take an hour or so, but in a saladthey kill almost immediately.     The rhubarb bought in stores has all the leaves taken off so you will haveto get the leaves from a farm or grow your own.     You don't have to be stingy with rhubarb and most other plant poisons likefiguring grains and grams.  Just chop up some leaves and put them in the salador stew or among the lettuce on hamburgers and you will hit the jackpot.     Castor beans are a good poison as they are almost tasteless when groundand only three or four are enough to kill.  They're easy to get, especially inSouthern California where they grow wild.  They cann be put into almost anyfood.     Oleanders are common flowers but are about as poisonous as any plant.  Theheart is affected very quickly and severly.  Both the leaves and branches arelethal.     A couple on poisettia leaves will kill just about anybody.  Better usethree.     Yew is a conifer, or cone bearing evergreen tree or shrub.  Any nurseryman can take you out in back and idetify it for you.  But he will get prettysurly if you start stripping off branches so you should buy a small tree, ifyou don't know where a big one is growing.     It's the foliage that kills so forget the berries.  It is so poisonous andso quick that at one time the Secret Service considered for suicide pills.  Thebeauty of it is that it kills almost immediately without any symptoms.  Youtake it and, splatt, you're on the floor, dead.     I'm not sure of the dosage but it's not that much.     The way to refine it is to fill a coffee percolator with the ground upfoliage and put eight ounces of alcohol in the pot.  Percolate it for about ahalf hour.  if the alcohol boils off, put in some more.     Cheap rubbing alcohol is good enough once you have distilled it off fromits water content.     When the process is finished, put the alcohol and what went through thepercolator into the still.  You then distill off the alcohol until you haveonly a couple of teaspoonfuls of residue left.  Pour this out into a saucer andlet it evaporate.     You can use the same process for a finer grade of nicotine from tobacco.Always strive for quality.     Laurel is another evergreen that can cause death by eating a single leaf.It is best percolated and distilled but it can be used as it is and put instews and as a garnish on hors d'oeuvres.
