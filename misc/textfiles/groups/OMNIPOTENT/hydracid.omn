It takesmany forms and works on the principle the hydrochloric acid reacts withaluminum powder, foil or metal, releasing a great, dark cloud or noxious gaswhich looks horrible and smells worse.     Hydrochloric acid is used for killing algae in swimming pools and forcleaning tile and stone work.     Where swimming pools are common it can be bought at the supermarket forless than a dollar a gallon.  It is also sold at hardware stores.     Being only 37% strength, it is seldom harmful to the skin but will eatthrough clothing like battery acid.     Hydrochloric acid is also know as muriatic acid.     On damp nights, a bottle of the acid alone, broken in the midst of acrowd, will form noxious clouds of chlorine gas.  Scream "Poison gas!" and youwill have a panic that will give you laughs for years.     When you get some, open it up and give it a sniff.  It won't hurt youbecause you couldn't stand to smell enough to be harmed.  Then put a couple ofsquare inches of aluminum foil in a can in your sink and pour some acid on thefoil.  If the acid bottle has been tightly capped the reaction of breaking downthe aluminum and producing a dark noxious gas should start in about a minute.If the bottle has been setting for months, poorly capped, the reaction may beimmediate.  You can stop the action at any time by turning on the faucet andflooding the aluminum with water.     When you have tested the reaction with foil, try it with powder and thenwith aluminum metal cut from pipe or a slab.     The versatility of the hydrochloric acid goody is amazing and should keepyou fascinated for hours.     Say you're sitting in a booth in a gay bar.  You have a brown paper bagat your feet by the wall.  In the bag is a gallon wine bottle.  Now, being apractical joker, you have poured about a pint of the hydrochloric acid intothe bottle and nearly filled it with gasoline.  The acid is on the bottom as itis heavier than the gasoline.     When you finished your beer, you drop a few chunks of aluminum cut from apipe into the bottle and cap it tightly.  Then you swish out, so you won't benoticed.  Soon the gas will burst the bottle and gasoline will be everywhere.And if many of the dear things are smoking there will be burning faggotsgalore.  Burning faggots, get it?  Oh well.     Of course, the Militant's most common use of the hydrochloric acid goodyis to clear areas of people he doesn't like.  In a movie or a meeting hall atin can full of aluminum powder, foil or chunks is put under a seat.  The acidis in a bottle with its mouth covered with a couple of plastic bags held inplace with a rubber band.  You can also use a plain rubber or a balloon overthe mouth of the bottle.     The cover is pierced with a pencil and the bottle is upended into the can,after which, the Militant gets up and walks out.  If the acid is old and reactsimmediately, a wad of sponge is put over the aluminum, causing the neededdelay.     A person sitting beside the Militant would not notice anything, especiallyif something exciting was happening up front.  By the time he noticed the odorthe reaction would have left him with nothing to do but run squealing andpissing from the scene.     The outside goody is great, too.  It is used to break up parades anddemonstrations and in riots, where it's every man for himself and the deviltake the hindmost.     It is simply a pint or quart bottle (a quart is better) filled with goodyand wrapped with several layers of aluminum foil and put in a paper sack.     Now, say a group of Militants infiltrate a civilian parade at differentpoints.  At an agreed upon time they yell, "They're throwing things!"  Then,while the other paraders are looking around and up, the Militants crash theiroutside goodies, still in the sacks, to the pavement.     As the parade moves on, the Militants filter back to where the goodiesare.  When the reaction starts they scream, "Poison gas!  Poison gas!" andpanic the whole mob out of the action.     The aluminum wrapped bottles have to be slammed down hard or they mightnow break.  If it's something like a smoke or pipe bomb, there is a better waythan to throw them down.     It is a good thing to cut out one of your pants pockets for this one.  Thebomb is in a sack under your jacket.  You light its fuse with a cigarette andslip the bomb into your pocket and let it drop down your pants leg.     It is best not to wear boots with this one.
