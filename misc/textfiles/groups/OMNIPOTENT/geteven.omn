     This is THE REFLEX here.  I originally typed most of these files in 40columns.  So I revised them and I'm u/ling them here.  I got a kick out ofthe book and for you who don't have it, don't buy it.  I'm typing in all thesections from it and I'm u/ling them all here.  I hope you enjoy them as muchI did.                           --==**>>THE REFLEX<<**==--=========ADDITIVES=========  Harmful additives are a formidable weapon against machinery, people, andprocesses.  Additives perform one or more of the following:  1) Corrosion...sulfuric acid, for example, will corrode the gutter, eaves,     and downspout of a home; dumped salt will mar a building surface or floor     and kill a lawn.  2) Contamination...copper salts will rot rubber products; soap in a public or     corporate fountain will create giant foam.  Or put it in a steam boiler if     you're more serious about the matter.  3) Abrasion...introduction of light, coarse materials, such as resins, to     automotive fuel, or metal filings placed in the gears of industrial     machinery, will create frictional havoc.  4) Impurities...adding sugar to gasoline greates harmful carbon from the     burning sugar, stopping the engine.  Soaps and detergents make wonderful additions to food and could even bebeneficial if the target happens to be constipated.  If not, then soap-ladenmunchies or drinks will really keep him moving.  During my stay as an invited guest of Uncle Sam I recall some dirtytricksters' making an action statement against being in KP.  They liberallycoated various pans and cooking vessels with GI soap.  They washed mugs with alot of soap, then neglected to rinse them before letting the utensils dry.Later, when some drinkable potion like milk or coffee was poured into the mugby some unsuspecting mark, the soap was activated.  Whoosh!  Soap is also a very effective additive to containers in which food isprepared.  The secret is to disguise the taste.  Various other additives willdo that and other tricks.  A horny old pharmacist, Doctor Frank Pittlover, claims there really is aworking aphrodisiac.  His is almost as esoteric as the fake stuff you readabout in men's magazines.  Here's what Doctor Pittlover says:  "It's known asyohimmbine hydrochloride (C21, H23, O3N2), an obscure sex stimulant thatoperates on the central nervous system.  It was the aphrodisiac used by the CIAin their MK/ULTRA scam." It is not on the Central Substances Act list--yet--and it is classed as a "veterinary aphrodisiac." That means you can getit openly from a pharmaceutical supply source.  What you do with it after youget it is probably your own business.  There are other references to and uses of additives in many other topicalareas of your revenge...many more than could be indexed here.  "Take tea and see" is a good advertising slogan that should also alert thedirty trickster to some additives brought to our attention by herbal-teaproducers.  Two common products of many herbal teas have side effects that thetrickster could define only as delightful.  First, some teas contain theleaves, flowers, and the bark of senna plant, a tropical shrub related to ourbean plant.  The dried leaves, bark, and flowers of this plant are a mightypowerful laxative.  Chamomile flowers are also popular in herbal teas.  Relatedto ragweed and goldenrod, chamomile can produce severe reactions in peoplesensitive to plants of that family.  The trick in both cases is to obtain extracts of both products and use themin concentrated enough additive form to create the desired effect.  Meanwhile, from the other end, Doctor Christopher Garwood Doyle has aprescription that could really get amark moving.  Syrup of ipecac is a commonpurgative, easily available.  Here's how Doctor Goyle uses it.  "Your mark is with you or your agent somewhere having a few drinks," thedoctor outlines.  "Presumably, the mark is drinking something sweet and heavy,like rum and Coke.  When the mark goes to the bathroom or is otherwise out ofthe area, mix one tablespoon of syrup in ipecac in with the drink.  "You now have a fifteen-minute waiting--or escaping, if you prefer-- periodfor the mixture to get active.  After that, bombs away!  The mark will beginviolent projectile vomiting, which really messes up the nearby environment andanyone else who happens to be the way.  "We first did this in medical school, using to get back at a classmate who'dturned us in to officials for having an after-hours party in our dorm withwomen and booze.  They threw the book at us because we were supposed to bemature medical students.  "The student who did this fancied himself as a real boozer," Doctor Doyleexplained, "but he really was a hell of a hypocrite about it and really playedpious when he turned us in.  So we figured he who tattles about booze shallalso toss his booze."  Doctor Doyle reports that this additive will work easily with non-alcoholicdrinks, too.  He says the secret is to select a carrier drink that will hidethe taste and consistency of the syrup.  Another good remedy for a hotshot is cascara sagrada, made from the driedroot of a thorny shrub found on the American West Coast.  It produces violentdiarrhea.  Once, Joe Kascaba introduced some cascara sagranda into a mark'sorange juice.  The mark was with his girlfriend and her parents in their familycar.  He had the "juiced" orange juice about ten minutes before getting intothe car.  Kascaba reminisced, "The stuff's fast acting, and we were lucky to have thegirlfriend's brother as our ally, to report the action.  It hit the mark aboutsix minutes into the trip, and in another minute he didn't even have time toyell for them to pull over.  He just started letting go with loud, wet,explosive bursts.  "This is all in full witness of his girlfriend and her family in a tightlypacked auto.  He couldn't get stopped, either.  They took him to a hospital,but by then the additive was through his system and the storm had subsided.That surely is super powerful stuff."  Kascaba explained why he had taken action this explosive action, saying, "Theguy was a real creep.  He was always trying to make out with other girls, andsince he wasn't very smooth, he used to get them drunk.  This was always withother girls, of course--his regular girlfriend knew nothing about all of this.  "Well, one night he pulled this crap on a friend of mine, got her drunk,messed around...she got this feeling all guilty and emotional, then got sick--puked, in fact.  He thought he was macho stuff and gave her hell for it.  "We figured if he was going to act like such a shit...well, I'm sure youunderstand...."  The above trick is suggested to be used in such a place so that your mark cannot easily reach a bathroom within a few minutes after the attack hits.  Thiswill cause him to literally shit his pants and drip at the heels.  As a final note, Kascaba says not to use this powerful additive with olderfolks, because it weaken them to the point of very seroius medicalcomplications such as dehyrdration which may kill them.  Have some respect forthe elderly, think of your grandmother!  The following trick is technically a substitution and not an additive:  Iknow of one person who visited her mark's home and emptied the hair conditionerout of his bottle, then poured Neet hair remover into the conditioner bottle.She knew that Operation Substitute was a bald success when she saw her mark ina local store several weeks later, wearing a large scarf on his head.  Vinegar makes a great substitute for nose drops or in nasal-spray devices.One especially nasty person also suggested it for use in eye drops.  I'm notsure about that one though, sight's a precious thing.  You'd better reservethat one for a very deserving person that shot your dog, wrecked your computer,busted you for phreaking, etc.========AIRLINES========  Did an airline ever lose your luggage?  Veteran air traveler Dottie Huntesuggests you return their favor and make yourself some money.  Here's her scam.Arrange to have a friend meet you at the terminal gate when you deplane.  Giveyour friend your baggage claim checks and have him/her retrieve your bags fromthe carousel, then leave the baggage area with your luggage, be sure you getyour claims checks back.  Then you saunter over to the baggage area and spendhalf an hour waiting for you bags.  Ask the clerk for some help, then reportyour "missing" luggage, showing your claim checks as proof.  "Very few flights have a clerk that actually check the baggage and collectthe claims checks," she says.  "It's foolish, but they don't."  She suggests you "make a polite but firm scene and demand satisfaction.Normally, the airline people will have you fill out a form, and they willattempt to trace your luggage.  Obviously, they won't find it.  Bug themsome...write them letters.  Soon, you should get a good settlement from theairline." Don't pull this one on the same airline more than once, Huntecautions.  Leaving the airlines and aiming for individual mark, you can do a lot ofpersonal damage.  For instance, if you find that your mark is going to useairline travel and there are only a few travel agents in town, you could calluntil you find the correct one and cancel the reservations.  Or if you know thename of the airline, call their office and cancel the mark's reservations.  You might try to slip a couple of rounds of pistol ammunition or aswitchblade knife into your mark's pocket just before he goes through the metaldetector at the airport terminal.  You could also slip some drugs into hispocket at the same time.  Read a book on pickpocketing to note the techniquefor doing this.  It's quite easy since you are placing stuff back.  Bill Cutcheon sometimes poses as a Moonie, Hare Krishna devotee, or othercultist and goes to airports.  His goal is to act like a completely obnoxiousfool.  He really hams it up, usually getting tossed out after totally grossingout the passengers.  The heat, of course, falls equally on the cults and on theairport for letting "them" behave like that.  Another Cutcheon stunt is to leave accurate-looking but totally bogus hijackscenario plans, bomb diagrams, or orders for terrorists attacks in airport barsand restrooms.  This fires up both the rent-a-cops and the real securitypeople.  The security delays and resultant hassles with passengers createunhappy people who are angry at airports and airlines.  Naturally, thew blame for these plans must focus on the original perpetratorof Cutcheon's problems.  He says, "If some nut group's been hassling me formoney, messing in my neighborhood, or otherwise being obnoxious, I'll leaveevidence to pin the hijack or bomb rap on them.  I got back at a motorcyclegang by doing this once, after they had sideswiped my truck and refused to paydamages."  He also explains that this is a good vengeance grabber against an airportfacility that has offended you.  Mitch Egan of San Francisco doesn't like cultist panhandlers harassing peopleat airports, so he founded the Fellowship to Resist Organized Groups Involvedin Exploitation, or FROGIE.  Egan and his friends use those little metalclickers shaped like frogs to ward of religious solicitors.  According to Egan, thousands of people across the country are now armed withthe little metal frogs, and when a religious panhandler approaches, they whipout the clicker and "Click, click, click!" the pest away.  "In San Francisco, I saw two hundred people clicking away at a Krishna," Eganremarked.  "They blew her right out of her socks."  He adds, "If God wants a dollar from me, he can ask for it.  I'm not againstreligion, but I'm fed up with organized beggars."  Relief is just a click away.  I knew a chap who became annoyed at a Krishna who followed him out of theIndianapolis airport, verbally abusing him for not making a contribution.Having surreptitiously "armed and primed" himself, our hero suddenly stopped,whipped around, and pissed all over the startled harridan.  After the fewnecessary seconds of attack, he calmly replaced himself, zipped up, and walkedaway.  A bemused security cop nearby tried to hide his laughter.=======ANIMALS=======  If your mark is an oily cuss with a credibility problem, you could easilypull off this stunt suggested by good old country boy Emil Connally.  Itinvolves a cop, reporters, SPCA folk, and some farm animals.  According to Connally, here's how it works.  You have two marks.  The primeone is a farm owner with the credibility problem.  We'll call him Mr.  Big.The secondary mark is a cop who's made an enemy of you.  In this case, pick oneof your local Attila the Hun cops, because he's a bully and his ego for a bustwill get in the way of his grain-sized brain.  Call the cop--try for his home phone even if it's unlisted--and tell him youknow about a cock or dog fight that's being held at Mr.  Big's farm.  Explainyou have no morals against animal fighting (build your own macho image) but youlost big money the last time and you think the fights are fixed.  Mention drugsand booze, too.  Next, call Mr.  Big and tell him you're an anonymous politicalally who wants to warn him about some people holding dog or cock fights on hisfarm.  Call reporters and the SPCA and tell them about the fight.  Tell themthat Mr.  Big and the cop have a payoff relationship.  Give everyone the samegeneral arrival time...never be too specific.  If all goes well, all will sort of show up at roughly the same time.  Youmight manipulate things so the press and animal lovers show up first.  Even ifa real story doesn't develop, you have scattered some strong seeds of distrust.  There is a variation if you want a stronger story.  Kill and mutilate a dogor rooster, then bury it for several days before you set up your animal-fightscenario at Mr.  Big's place.  Tell the reporters and the SPCA where theevidence is buried.  It will be fun to hear the two marks talk about thesethings to the other parties.  Maybe there's a story here after all.  Dead animals are so useful.  Don't you agree?  A nefarious lady known only asHong Kong Hattie once waited until her mark went to the airport to depart on abusiness trip.  Then, using the nefarious methods for which she is so famous,Hattie got to the mark's car in the airport parking lot and go the lock opened.She then stuffed a large and very dead groundhog into the glove compartment.Hattie then locked the car and strolled away.  Reportedly, the mark sold hiscar at quite a financial loss just a few days after getting back from hisbusiness trip.  One of the plagues for newspaper deliverers is barking, biting dogs thatattack both kids and their bicycles.  Tom Frickert, today a newspaper magnatebut once a paperboy, has a solution.  "A good-quality plastic water pistol filled with freshly squeezed lemon juiceis the ticket," Frickert says with a chuckle.  "You shoot the felanious furballright in the eyes, and it'll soon stop the canine harassment.  "I once shot a big, nasty cur with the juice, and he never bothered meagain...used to hide under his masters porch whenever I came down the sidewalkto deliver the paper."  If your neighbor's constantly yowling and howling dog bothers you,congratulations, you're normal.  But unlike most who sit and suffer, you cancall the local SPCA and tell them how the neighbor mistreats the animal.  Holdyour phone near the window so the SPCA can hear the "evidence" right from thesource.==========APARTMENTS==========  Your mark lives in an apartment?  A squirt or so of Eastman 910 or a similartype glue into the lock can screw up the mark's trying to get back into theapartment after an evening on the town.  It's best to save this one until lateevening or on a weekend.  Of course, this same stunt would work on a house, butan apartment lockout disturbance causes more of a public scene.  If the mark's apartment is an older building with wooden door frames and youcan work quitly and quickly at night, you can lock him/her in the apartmentfrom the outside.  Quietly fix a hasp and keeper on the door and frame usingwooden screws.  Then slap a padlock on the new fixture.  It creates a greatdeal of frustration if that door is the only way out of the apartment.  Do itlate Saturday night so the discovery is made on Sunday morning when it'simpossible to get help.  Run a classified ad offering to sublet the mark's apartment.  You can listeither the mark's telephone number or that of his/her landlord.  As usual, makethe contact hour for very early in the morning "because of shift-workschedule."  You might want to make a "milk run" to the mark's apartment very early onseveral mornings and place a whole bunch of empty booze bottles outside his orher door.  This works well in ritzy apartments where the neighbors are snobs.How do you get by the security people?  One way is to pose as a deliveryperson, a service person, a building inspector, or someone on a work crew.  Youcan also hire an accomplice in the building, or you can bribe the door guard.  Suppose you are the victim of a nasty landlord who evicts you for no goodreason.  There are lots of legal ways to get your tenant's rights, but thereare also many quasi-legal and illegal ways that are much more fun.  Forexample, you could simply "sublet" the place, on your own, to a bunch ofdopers, bikers, drunks, hookers, runaways, or twenty-four-hour party throwers.Make this extracuricular subletting your going-away surprise.  Another person I know went to the local animal shelter on several differentdays and got a total of fifteen cats for twenty-five dollars.  He bought abunch of cat food and a bushel basket of fish, and filled his bathtub withwater for them.  He then nailed every window and door shut from the insidebefore crawling out the tiny casement window in the basement.  He hadpreviously nailed the basement door shut behind him.  Obviously, he had movedhis things out several days previously.  His eviction notice was effective thenext day, but the landlord didn't check on the house for five days.  My God,what a mistake that man made.  To say that that cat house was an uninhabitablemess is an understatement.  Tim Carroll was tossed out of his apartment by the landlady because one ofTim's many lady friends stayed over for the whole entire evening.  This upsetthe old biddy who owened the building, and being a staunch, God-fearing chartermember of the DAR, she canceled his lease and ordered him to leave thebuilding.  Displeased with the abitrary and unilateral treatment and the upheavealcaused by her dubious moral judgement, Tim didn't get angry; he got even.  Hehad a trusted friend place a large sign in a hallway window of the landlady'sapartment building.  The seventh-floor window faced a busy business street, andthe sign was quite visible to many hundreds of people.  The sign read:  TIM CARROLL SUCKS.  The landlady didn't see the sign, so two days later, Tim's friend positionedanother sign, this time in a sixth-floor-hall window.  The second sign read:  TIM CARROLL IS A FAG.  The landlady saw both signs and removed them.  Two days later, she got aletter from Tim, with a picture enclosed showing her building with the signseasily visible.  The letter was Tim's complaint about personal slander andharassment.  He asked her please to desist.  Sometime early the next morning, in time for rush-hour morning traffic, a newsign went up in the window:  TIM CARROLL BLOWS DEAD BEARS.  At 8:30 A.M., the unsuspecting landlady recieved a call from an attorneyfriend of Tim's, citing the original slander and warning the woman againstfurther incidents.  Shaken, she swore her innocence.  Ten minutes after hangingup, he called back, sounding furious because Tim had just called him about thelatest sign.  Flabbergasted, the old lady swore she would remove it and loudlyproclaim her innocence.  Another sign went up that afternoon in time for rush-hour the other way:  TIMCARROLL IS A FLAMING HETEROSEXUAL.  The landlady got the lawyer's call just after dark, when the sign was nolonger visible.  She was almost in tears because of his threats to sue.  Shebegged to just talk to Tim, to tell him none of this was her doing.  Theattorney told her that he had advised his client to have no further discussionswith her.  The next day's sign read:  FOR A GOOD LAY, CALL TIM CARROLL.  That evening, a new sign went up.  The landlady, frantic, according to Tim'sfriend who was putting up the signs, got to it fifteen minutes after it wentup.  The attorney called her five minutes after she got back to her ownapartment.  Tim related, "You might feel almost sorry for the old lady, except that shehad told me earlier that she was going to keep my security deposit and that Iwould have to forfeit the month's rent I had paid in advance because I hadviolated the morality clause in my lease.  The was no such clause.  I found outshe had done this same thing to two other guys a year before and some guysbefore that.  She also tossed out a couple because they weren't married.  She'dcome into your room when you were gone and snoop, too.  That bugged me."  No signs went up for the next three days, although the woman checked thewindows every twenty minutes or so.  On the fourth day, hundreds of passersby,accustomed to the signs weren't disappointed.  The new sign read:  TIM CARROLL'S WHOREHOUSE.  Although it took her an hour to discover and remove it, the lawyer friend ofTim's didn't call until the next morning, when a new sign was in the window:WHOREHOUSE UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.  The landlady's telephone number was listed.  A second sign was placed on the sixth-floor window underneath:  TIM CARROLLCOULDN'T BEAT THE COMPETITION.  In his best tones, the attorney explained that enough was enough and that onbehalf of his client, Mr.  Carroll, he would be filing an action.  The womanwas distraught.  He told her to have her attorney present for a meeting atthree the following afternoon.  He asked her who her attorney was and said themeeting should be in his office.  Tim and his attorney postponed this meetingseveral times, then told the woman that since she had stopped putting up thesigns, they would hold the suit in limbo for the time.  Reportedly, she monitored the halls and windows of that building regularlyfor five months.  But more importantly, she also left her tenants to their ownmoral lives.=============ASSASSINATION=============  Suppose you have a mark whose ill temper has created problems for you.  Orperhaps this mark is simply an obnoxious nut whose obsessions have cost youpersonally.  A dentist I know spent many unselfish hours working to getflouride into his community's drinking water as a means of fighting tooth decayin children.  An apolitical and highly dedicated professional, he was concernedonly with healthcare for the kids in the community.  A hyper, rightwing zealotjumped on the issue and scared the town council with his insane babble.  Heclaimed that flouride was a Communist plot to poison America's drinking waterand minds and that using flouride would lead to LSD as part of theInternational Communist Conspiracy.  The timid council voted "no" on flouride.  Beside himself, the young dentist said he surely would like to get back atthe rightwing firebrand but just didn't know what to do.  Sighing, he gave uphis fight and put his time back into his practice.  The kids never got theirflouride treatment, and as a result he had a lot of business.  It's too badthat young dentist never met Maurice Bishop.  In the hypocritical piety following the assassinations of the sixties,physical security was supposedly tightened to protect the chief executivechosen by the power brokers who now control the United States.  A formerlaw-enforcement official with a probable intelligence background offered anastounding dirty trick related to this topic.  To protect this source'sidentity we'll use the cover name of Maurice Bishop.  Bishop says that the CIA, FBI and Secret Service all keep a list of nutcases, radicals, and others who threaten political figures.  Often, thesepeople are jailed, kept under protective custody, or placed undertwenty-four-hour surveillance by autorities when poltical targets are in thearea.  Bishop's idea calls for theatening telegrams to be sent to thepolitician in the mark's name.  At the very least this telegram will bring avisit by one of the government agencies, and perhaps it will result in a bit ofjail time if the mark loses his/her cool as a result of this dirty trick.  Bishop says this will also work with state officials, bringing a visit fromstate police or some other law enforcement official.============AUTO DEALERS============  If an automobile dealership screws you, on either the car, the deal, or theservice, don't get angry--get even.  Wait outside the showroom until aprospective customer starts talking to a salesperson about the same type of caryou got.  Walk right up to the customer and tell him you woeful story.  Theidea is to screw up as many sales as you can (it will cost the dealer at least$5000 for each screw-up).  Be factual, be cool, and act as if you're an honestcitizen trying to save another honest citizen some money and heartache --as youwish someone had done for you.  Sincere good faith is the thing here, becausethe saleman is going to blow his about the second time you pull your act.  When the manager asks you to leave and you don't, he will probably call thepolice.  You had anticipated this earlier and alerted someone at the localnewspaper or television station--probably the action-line reporters.  Smalltownmedia usually won't allow reporters to come--car dealers buy lots of ads, andyou don't.  A regional TV station may show up--if you promise a confrontationwith the law.  So when the manager calls the police, you call your TVreporter--fun and games for the 6:00 P.M.  news.  If all this doesn't work, wait off the dealer's premises and approachcustomers as they leave the showroom.  Tell your story there and then.  Offerto help them avoid your mistake.  But stay on public property.  And keep afterthe action-line reporters.  If you esculate the attack a bit, show up when the night salespeople are onduty--they won't recognize you.  Look at new cars; wander around.  Fewsalespeople pay much attention to an obvious gawker.  As soon as someone elseor a telephone distracts the salesperson, you can do things to the automobileright there in the showroom.  A bottle opener is hard on the finish.  See thefile on additives for things you could quickly put into the fuel tank.  If youcould smuggle some in with you, stuff roadkill under a car seat or in the glovecompartment.  Or toss a condom (preferably used) on the front seat.  By theway, used condoms make wonderful plants in other locations as well, like theboss's desk, or in a customer's car back in the service shop.  If you can manage to slip undetected into the service area along with yourbag of sabotage goodies, such as glue, wire cutters, paint, potatoes, M80s,etc., you can run amok.  Work quietly and quickly.  This sort of guerrillawarfare can literally wreck a dealer's service reputation.=====BANKS=====  It could be time to make your bankroll.  According to Townsend Alexander, ourfinancial intelligence agent, you can make good money buying some very cheapforeign coins that are the same size as a quarters.  Get a paper coin wrapper.Wrap a few real quarters on the ends but fill the rest of the roll with thecheapie import coins.  Wrap the roll and with felt-tip pen write some phonyaccount number on it to add to authenticity.  Take the roll of coins into the targeted bank.  If you dress like a businessperson and go at a busy time, especially with the account number written oneach roll, and the rolls in a bank sack or your briefcase, the teller willprobably give you ten dollars per roll without checking.  If you could get a banker to tell the truth, he'd admit that they hatecollege-student checking accounts.  There's probably a lot of justification,since most services like this for college students cost far more than they'reworth in return.  However, that's not our problem.  Suppose you have a gripe with the bank.  Acting as the bank's ad manager, getin touch with the student newspaper at the school and arrange to run some adswith banner headlines reading, STUDENTS WELCOME, plus such services as NOSERVICE CHARGE, FREE CUSTOM-PRINTED CHECKS, INTEREST ON THE BALANCE, NO MINIMUMBALANCE, and so on.  Offer to give away free albums or Walkman radios.  The dayafter the "bank's" ad runs they will be swamped with unwanted students, who aregoing to be very angry at the bank (and probably at the student newspaper).  Modern banks now have cash machines where you insert your plastic money cardand the machine gives you the money.  If that institution or its machine hasbecome your target, here's a dairyland delight you could easily employ.  Takesome tough, hard cheese and cut it the same size and shape as your plasticcard.  Insert the cheese "card" into the slot of the machine and leave thearea.  One banker told me it took a service person nine hours to clean themachine and get it operating again when someone pulled this stunt in Baltimore.  The bank still giving you trouble, or you didn't give them enough?  It's timeto move things up the scale a notch.  Rent a safe-deposit box under anothername.  Pay cash for a three-month rental.  That's all the time you'll need tocollect on this one.  Go to the market and buy a couple of overripe fish--I'msure you'll get a bargain price.  Carry them wrapped in plastic in yourbriefcase.  Go directly to your safe deposit box.  In the privacy of the bank'slittle cubicle, unwrap the fish and lay the big, stinky suckers right in thesafety deposit box.  Close it, lock it, and store it.  Then carry the fishwrappers, briefcase, and yourself out of the bank.  In a few days your depositwill gain their intrest.  You'd better do your real banking at anotherinstitution for a while.  It's quite possible bank officials will have to hiresomeone to drill the lock on the targeted safe-deposit box to remove thecontents.======BIKERS======  You're walking along a pedestrian sidewalk, and along comes a bicyclist,churning away his/her spare calories on that nonpolluting transportaion device.Within moments you're an involuntary participant in a game of chicken with thatcyclist, who swerves while you weave.  You finally pass each other in gooddodgeum-car fashion.  Maybe.  Wonderful stuff, adrenaline.  On the other cheek, maybe you've been blindsided by an irresponsible cyclisttrespassing on your pedestrian walk right of way.  "No more turning the other cheek," is the war cry of Mel Scafe, ananticyclist who is fighting back.  "I've declared war on all two wheelers who trespass into my life," Mel says."I'll get the senior citizen bicyclist who forces me off my sidewalk on thesame day I get even with the teenage dirt biker who tears up the hill behind myhome."  One of Mel's tatics is to toss a length of chain into the spokes of the dirtbike when it's roaring by.  Instantly, the bike stops going forward while therider continues onward until gravity takes over.  "I've also used a wire cutter to snip the spokes on a bicycle whose owner hasdone me a disfavor," Mel relates.  "That'll cause a real collapse in his bikinggame."  Another time he spread a large patch of grease on the path used by dirtbikers.  He can't even estimate the pounds of air he's released from captivity in biketires.  He's used all the nasty engine additives mentioned in another file forthese machines that disturb his world.  "I liked that Burt Reynolds movie where the truck driver drove his rig overall those goddamn motorcycles," Mel grinned.  Turning seriously, he added,"I've thought about the old World War II trick of stretching piano or barbedwire across a trail or bikeway, but I think that could be fatal, so I don'treally do it."  "If there were some way I could totally kill the damn machines and onlyembarrass the people a bit I'd surely like to hear about it.  Until then I willstick to the old standards that have worked for me so far."  He adds, "I know people may sneer at me for being mean to kiddies on theirbicycles, and I know bicycles are an in thing today.  But maybe if those youngriders learn some manners early and stay the hell off pesestrian walkways, theymight grow up to be decent people."=====BOOKS=====     Did anyone ever borrow a book from you and not return it?  Our privatelibrary consultant, Roberta Russell, has a suggestion with an air of financialfinality behind it.  For the first step, a printer should make you about threeor four dozen bookplates, all featuring your mark's name and address, plus thelegend, "If this book is lost and you find it and return it, I will pay you$10 cash."  Your next step is the local Goodwill Industries, a local thrift orsecond-hand shop, or a garage sale for books.  Buy two or three dozen usedhardcover books.  You buy them as cheaply as you can, but they'll cost yourmark plenty.  Your next step is to paste on the bookplates and distributethese books--at the beach, on park benches, in a bus or subway, or in a bar orrestaurant.  The final step is for you to enjoy a good chuckle at your mark'sexpense, as people find the "lost" books.     If your mark has a fine library, you might consider introducing it tosilverfish.  They love good books; in fact they will devour them.  If you feelthis nasty, you probably already know where to get silverfish and their eggs.This one bothers me, though, since I love good books.  Maybe there's a betterway.  Perhaps you could put an earwig in you mark's bed pillow.     Why not give your mark the image of a philathropic person?  Donate booksin his/her name to the local library, but without either party's knowledge.Buy a bunch of really scuzzy porno paperbacks, especially the colorfullyillustrated ones from Denmark--the more grossly hardcore, the better.  Yourprinter will produce some paste-in bookplates that say something like this,"This book donated to the [Name] library by [Mark's name] in loving memory ofall the sweet children of [Town name]."  Paste in the bookplates and sprinklethe donated books around the local library.  Put some in the children section,and others in the religion books.========CAMPUSES========  Not everyone is hibernating on college campuses.  Although it's true thatmany students have become docile zombies, lobotimized by lethal doses oftelevision and the bureaucracy of the educational system, there are a few liveones.  At an eastern university, a number of students got upset with the rentgouging of a massive corporation acting as an absentee landlord for privateoff-campus dormitories.  After getting nowhere appealing to an untesticledschool administration, and after being ignored by a housing inspector and acity council belonging to the same social class and clubs as the corporatelandlords, the students held a pizza party.  The unusual part was the the pizza party was held in the clothes dryers ofthe dormitory laundry rooms.  One particpant reported, "We dumped a couple ofreally gooey pizzas in each dryer, put in the coins, and turned them on."  Try cleaning up that one!  Epilogue:  The corporate landlord and his student tenants settled theirproblems shortly after the party, totally to the satisfaction of the youngprotestors.  Professor James Shannon claims that college students of the past had heinousimaginations.  Today, of course, many students are content merely to movearound enough to prevent roots from forming on their contact surfaces with theground.  Professor Shannon suggests that if you have a teacher you don't like,and he/she lectures from a desk or podium on a raised platform, you move thestand so its legs are barely balanced on the front edge of the platform.  Whenthe academic leans forward on the structure ever so slightly, it will comecrashing forward.  With any luck the pedagogue will land on top of it.  At an eastern university, two looser colleagues filled a humorless andbookish faculty member's office closet with several large and irritable geeseone evening.  The professor was in the habit of arriving quite early for 8:00AM class, early enough so that the hasty-tempered birds would just beawakening.  When he opened the closet door they woke up and became badlyaggressive really fast.  Eyewitness reports left no doubt whose feathers wereruffled most.  This will be truly appreciated only by those privy to the pettiness ofacademia:  Other colleagues of this same professor sometimes send trulypedantic, nasty, personal, and vindictive memoranda to various other facultymembers, deans, etc., in the name of their priggish colleagues.  On one occasion they sent really nasty letters to the parents of a few ofthis faculty member's students, giving the poor folks hell for daring toproduce such genetic drift as their kids, much less turning them loose on acollege campus.  The school's PR people had a terrible time getting out fromunder that one.  As for the mark, the dumb schmuck had no idea why so manypeople disliked him.  But please take his colleagues word for it--he deservesevery bit of it.=======CARBIDE=======  Having been brought up around hunters and miners, I learned all about carbidelamps and carbide fishing early.  Working on my grandfather's farm, I learnedabout carbide bombs.  Let me explain some things you might find useful.  When calcium carbide is exposed to air and water it produces a gas that willkill small animals.  Farmers often pour it down gopher, rat, or groundhogholes, then dump in some water and put a rock over the hole.  The animal isgassed to death.  A lot of poor people used to fish with carbide with the same efficiency withwhich legions of GIs fished with hand grenades.  Simply toss a pound or two ofcarbide into a can and seal it, but be sure to punch a few holes in the lid.Toss it into a pond.  The results can play havoc with your mark's fish pond orfancy goldfish pool or an indoor aquarium.  Water and carbide can produce anexplosion.  Some of the nastier kids used to place amounts of carbide into the toilets atour school.  The idea was to place the carbide bomb in the toilet, leave alighted cigarette on the seat, and run like hell.  The carbide would combinewith the water to produce a huge cloud of noxious gas, which would explode whenit hit the lighted cigarette the perpetrators left behind.  This littlehomemade bomb did more damage than an M80.  Tim Bell, who later became a Special Forces NCO in Vietnam, explains, "We hada kid bully whom no one liked--a real prick.  He always went to the john afterfourth period to sneak a smoke.  So two of us went in right after him and laida carbide bomb in the water in the next stall.  We were about a hundred feetdown the hall when the damn thing went off."  At this point, Tim burst into a wild laughter.  I was able to learn, though,that the bully had his legs burned and cut by flying porcelain, bit his tonguebadly, was knocked violently off the throne, bruising his ribs against thesteel wall of the stall, and was deafened for nearly twenty-four hours, all bythe force of this carbide explosion.  With that kind of background as a highschool kid, it's no wonder Tim Bell made a good Special Forces trooper.  Are there more adult uses for carbide?  Some sixties semi-terrorists used todump a pound or so into the toilets of corporate offices and governmentbuildings, flush the mess into the system, and walk away briskly.  Enough ofthe stuff could get very dangerous, considering the possible backup of gases.A combination of water and carbide has been fed into the ventilating systems ofvarious corporate and government buildings, also by semi-terrorists who wish toharass the resident bureaucrats.====CARS====     This one's really kiddie Halloween time, but it does work.  A bunch ofold nuts and bolts placed into the wheel well behind the hubcap will make themark think his/her car is falling apart.  It's worth some minor harassment, ofcourse, and works outstandingly well with high-strung nonmechanical typed whoabsolutely panic at car noises.     You can get a little heavier than Halloween by removing a hubcap fromyour mark's car wheel and loosening or removing the lug bolts.  Sooner or notmuch later, the wheel will simply roll off the car.     Moving up the escalator of nastiness, you could probably fill your mark'swhole body with adrenaline if you placed a split shot sinker, of the type usedby fishermen, on the accelerator cable of his/her vehicle.  Willy Seamore, atop mechanic, suggests you extend the cable, then place the lead weight on theextended portion, which effectively blocks it from returning.  This means thevehicle's throttle will run wide open.  It's a nasty version of thejack-rabbit start.     From choking up to locking up is hardly a quantum experience.  The newmiracle glues are impregnable when squirted into car door keyholes.  Nothingshort of a locksmith can repair this low-risk attack.  If you hit just beforethe mark's family vacation, leave the car door locks alone and hit the trunklock.  With any luck, they'll never notice until they're miles from home.     A refinement of simply putting a super glue or epoxy into the car'svarious locks is to take any old key that will vaguely locks is to take anyold key that will vaguely fit into the lock cavity, insert it, then twist itrapidly back and forth until the key breaks off, stuck in the lock.  Now isthe time to squirt glue into the lock.  The job is more permanent and morecostly to repair.     If you tire of fooling with the locks, you can look elsewhere.  MarshallTanner, inventor of muffler bearings, says you can prop some large-headednails against the tires of your mark's car, especially if it's parked so itwill have to be backed up to get out of a parking stall in a lot.  The carmoves back and the wheels roll over the nails, puncturing tires.     If your mark's married, you can have all sorts of sport with his ride.  Amale mark deserves that you slip sexy undergarments usually worn by a sexylady under his car's front seat or wedge them carefully into the back seat.You could tear them a bit.  More than a hint of perfume or flavored douchewill always hype suspicion.  You can escalate this stunt somewhat if you buymale underwear--get the sexy style in white--and place some lipstick smearsaround the fly area.  You can help the campaign along by having a very trustedlady friend call and ask nervously for the mark.  The younger she sounds, thebetter.  Have her call several times.  Use your and the mark's wife'simagination.     If the mark is a woman, a pack of condoms carelessly hidden in the car isalways a sure-grow plant.  Several daint handkerchiefs of the type favored bymilady and heavily impregnated with semen can also be stuffed in the car.  Aswith the male, a series of appropriately timed telephone calls from a nervousmale will add to the marital festivities between mark and spouse.     In less carnal surroundings, if you can get to the distributor cap,remove it and use graphite from a pencil to contact the rotor brushes.  Thecharge will run along the graphite, causing the engine to misfire.  This couldcause the mark to dash into his local car butcher and get charged anoutrageous price for an unnecessary tuneup.     A quick way to disable a car battery is to slip a couple of Alka-Seltzertablets or a teaspoonful of baking soda into each battery compartment.  Theantacid will kill the battery's power before you can say "Plop, plop, fizz,fizz."     Another camhead nasty is to take a pushpin and jab a few tiny holesthrough spark-plug wires.  According to Lee H. Santana, a real straightshooter in the dirty-tricks department, the pin pricks cause a hellishlyrumpety noise when the car is driven.     Don't forget additives when working on a mark's car.  The nice thingabout additives is that you don't have to be odd or even to use them.  Manyexperts, including some of Uncle Sam's khaki-clad nephews, suggest lightmaterials, such as crushed cork, as a great additive to the gasoline tanks ofvehicles belonging to people or institutions you don't like.     One former professional trickster said, "It isn't to exotic, but ahandful of old leaves in the gas tank will bind the damn engine up too."     Sand is not recommended because of its weight, especially when wet.  Itwould sink to the bottom of the tank and not much would be introduced into theengine, he explained.  The idea is to get the additive to the bearingsurfaces, where the coarse little buggers can kick and scratch up a mechanicalbreakdown.  Silicone carbide, emery powder, and fine metal filings will work.During World War II, our OSS used a mixture of finely ground cork, resins,carborundums, and metal alloys to muck up an engine.     Another method that could possibly send a driver off to a service stationwould be to pour a gallon of shellac thinner into your targeted vehicle'sgasoline tank.  The alcohol will gather up all the water in the fuel trap, andwhen this mixture goes through the fuel line it will cause the vehicle tosnort, stammer, and act as if it has big carb troubles.  By the time thedriver gets the vehicle to a mechanic, the problem has usually departed outthe exhaust pipe.  Done enough times, this one can redline the frustration andcredibility levels of both the driver and the mechanic.     If you want to use additives in your mark's gasoline tank, yet areconcerned about arousing suspicion in daylight or in an otherwisehigh-visibility area, simply adopt a cover prop.     "Put the harmful additive in a metal gasoline can like they sell instores," advises Joey MacJohns, a veteran trickster.  "That way, any potentialwitnesses will never really pay attention to what's happening; they'll simplyinfer because you have a gas can that you're putting gas in the car."     And don't forget oil additives.  Styrene, a colorless, oily liquid, is anorganic compound that is one of the two chemicals mixed together to makehardened fiberglass.  Boat-supply stores and marinas have styrene availablefor patching fiberglass boats.  It is also used in body shops andupholstery-repair places.     There are substitutes compounds that will do the same job as styrene, soread the label when purchasing the stuff to make sure you're actually gettingstyrene.  Styrene is the only sufficiently effective, commonly availablematerial that can be put into a car's crankcase to completely break down theoil and ruin the engine.     Styrene in the crankcase is far better that sugar in the gas tank becauseit can't be seen after being introduced and because only a little does athorough job.  If it's used at the rate of one per four quarts of oil, thetreated vehicle will run about a hundred miles before the engine locks uptight.     This is a fairly high-risk stunt, but it could be fun if you don't getnailed doing it, according to Bill Rally.  If you find that your mark is goingalone to a movie you have an hour or so to have some fun with his automobile.If you're motivated enough to carry off this stunt, no one has to tell you howto start the mark's car without a key.  After you start it, drive to some verynice homes with pretty lawns.  But stay fairly near the theater, so you canget back there in a hurry.  Do donuts, dig out, and otherwise use the car tomake a shambles of lawns, shrubbery, flower beds, etc.  Run over lawnfurniture, hit mailboxes, and try to frighten some old people by coming reallyclose to them with the car.     This is a real hit-and-run mission.  Do your dirty driving fast and getthe car back to the theater parking area even faster.  Park it and leave.  Ifyou've done enough damage, all sorts of police reports will be out on the car.The second or third question the police will ask the mark is whether he or shehas any witnesses for the movie alibi.     That can be a real blast.  But if you want another sort of pop, digdeeply into the potato bin for this one.  My thanks here go to all those greattruck farmers who say a potato jammed into a vehicle's exhaust pipe is notexplosive, but it will cause all sorts of nasty problems.  In one case, themark parked his car with the rear end towards his home.  His tormentor jammeda fresh, hard spud tightly inot the car's exhaust pipe.  The mark started thecar on a cold evening and waited a few moments for the engine to warm.Meanwhile, the hot gases, unable to escape, built up dangerously behind thepotato....Woom!...KABLOOM!...  With an explosive roar, the gases fired thatbig, hot, hard potato right into the metal siding of the mark's home, justfifteen feet away from the exhaust pipe, which acted as a cannon barrel.  Theholing and denting of the siding cost $150 and a day to repair.     There are all sorts of other devices that make good muffler bombs.  Afirecracker may be shoved into the vehicle's exhaust pipe, pushing it alongwith a stiff wire until the explosive device falls into the muffler.  It takesonly a few moments of driving with today's hot exhaust gases to explode thefirecracker.  Even a fairly small firecracker will cause panic, escpecially ifthe driver is paranoid to start with.  If you want to destroy the muffler anddrive the mark's panic into the fantasy of having his/her car really bombed,substitute an M80 or a shotgun shell for the prankish finger-sizedfirecracker.     If the violence and property destruction of this bothers you or causesyou to grimace, consider this next happy face.  Most mail-order and noveltystores sell very realistic rubber-faced masks, resembling everything from anape man, through a drooling idiot, on down to a Ronald Reagan mask.  Selectone that looks especially gross--like an old man, or the idiot, or RichardNixon.  Position is so it looks realistic on the back of your head.  Thisleaves your vision unobstructed.  Head for the road in your car.     Just as another motorist overtakes your vehicle to pass you, lean out thewindow.  The effect on the approaching motorist would be interesting toobserve, as that other driver will see a drooling goon looking back, directlyat him, with no apparent concern for the road ahead.  I bet very few carsactually pass you with this stunt in operation.     Taking the license plate off a mark's car can be a good shot, even youdon't want to steal the thing for other nefarious purposes.  How many times doyou look to see if the plate is on your car?  A cop has only to look once.  Ibet it would be fun to hear the mark's explanation of where his license platehas gone.     Don't you get really happy when some defective excuse for a humansuddenly pulls his/her vehicle out directly in front of yours or cuts you off?Marty Mullin has a solution in hand.     A delightful person, Mullin reveals, "I bought a top-quality pelletpistol, one of those compressed-air guns, which I keep in my car.  You can useeither the cartridge or the pump type--just to be sure you get one with enoughpower to penetrate metal.  Get a supply of the .177-caliber pellets, too.Then, next time some dip pulls out in front of you, pull up behind the dip'svehicle and get in his/her blind spot.  With a truck or van that's easyenough.  Then you bring your pellet gun into action.     "Plunk a shot into the mark's vehicle, the trunk for a car, or the backof a van or rig.  If it's a big truck you can get in quite a few shots,because the driver is not likely to hear them.  A van or car will make ahelluva TWHUNK when that pellet hits, so be cautious.     "There's no discharge noise, because you're not using a firearm.  Afteryour attack, back off and proceed your business as if nothing has happened.You probably have not taught the mark a lesson, but you feel better for whatyou just did--I guarantee that."     I asked Mullin about the posibility of hitting a passenger who is ridingin the back of the mark's vehicle.  He replied, "Then, that passenger also hasevery right to be furious with the dippy mark for pulling out in front ofyou."========CB RADIO========     Want to send your neighborhood CB nut a message?  This nut is the CBaddict who refuses to filter his/her equipment and thus disrupts TV, stereo,AM/FM, and other normal communication for blocks.  Usually, these idiots areabout as sensitive to other people's feelings as Idi Amin was to the plight ofthe poor.  In both cases a lesson is called for.     To do this effectively, heed the lesson of Sterling Orco, who says youmust personally interdict the mark's CB antenna.  It would be well to do thiswhen the mark is away from the home area.  Unfasten the CB coax line from themark's antenna.  Then clip two leads of a regular 110-volt line to the CBcoax--one lead to the center conductor, the other lead to the shield.  Smallalligator clips will do nicely.  Then, hop down from your perch near theantenna and plug the other end of the 110-volt wire into your mark's nearestoutdoor socket.     Next time he/she turns on the CB and hits the transmit button...well,words fail to describe the results adequately.  One comment--even the repairpeople will shake their heads.     A bit less destructive, but no less nasty, Is the old pin-in-the-coaxtrick.  You prick a tiny pin through the plastic outer cable and through theshield.  Be sure it touches the center conductor.  Then cut the head off thepin and push it in some more--out of sight.  The plastic should close behindthe pin, making the wound invisible.  Just make sure that the pinshort-circuits the center conductor to the metal outer shield.  Do a couple ofthese along the coax between the antenna and the CB set.  It does stutteringwonders for the transmission.=========CHARITIES=========     Charity begins at the home of your mark.  You simply volunteer his/herservices to the charity's recruiting chairperson, giving the name and addressof your mark.  These charity drives are so happy to get volunteers these daysthat they will rarely verify your call.  That means the first contact the markhas is when another volunteer shows up at the door with all sorts of campaignand collection materials.  In many cases, the mark is too embarrassed torefuse, and you've added to his/her workload.     If you think that's a dirty trick to pull on a charity, ask them how manycents out of each dollar go directly to the victims and other people who areat the bottom of the line for help.  Besides, your mark might turn out to be agreat charity worker.     You can call in generous pledges in your mark's name during telethons andother charity drives.     You can also call in pledges to bothersome telethons, usingdouble-entendre names.  For example, when one public-TV station held anotherof its semiweekly fundraisers, several contributors announced over the air aspledging financial support included Clint Toris, Seymour Kunt, Connie Lingus.     Margie Kowalski used to work for the Salvation Army.  She suggests thatyou call the local Salvation Army, Goodwill, or whatever charity and reportyour mark for stealing out of the organization's pickup boxes.  Report themark by his auto license number.  Say you work at one of the stores near thecollection box and you've seen the mark rob the box several times.  You canalso report this "crime" to the police.======CHEESE======     It's tried and true, but I bet you haven't heard of it since you were akid.  This one came from Alabama, the old Limburger-cheese-on-the-muffler-of-a-new-car trick.  The exhaust manifold works well, too, as a surface for acheese spread.  Or you can simply place som of the same substance behind aradiator in a home or office.  Once it's burned on, the smelly sour effect canlast for weeks, despite robust cleaning efforts.===========CHILD ABUSE===========     I heard a real horror story recently where a truly evilminded teenager[Hmmm...] swore to child-abuse officers in her county that her parents beather.  They hadn't and didn't.  Never mind; the bureaucrats came bouncing outof the woodwork, and the harried parents had to appear in court to defendthemselves against the lies of a teenager with mental problems [Hmmm II...].The parents were looked upon as villians, even though the judge dismissed thecharges as unfounded.  Their attorney (yes, they had to hire one to fightgovernment persecution) advised them against a jury trial because they'd loseon the emotionalism of the issue, regardless of the facts.  Nice.     All this leads up to the fact that you can report your mark as achild-abuse offender.  Acting as a "concerned neighbor," you can tell theauthorities.  The hassle is unreal.  After you've done this, a few anonymousletters to the mark's employer about the "child-abuse thing" will help out.===CIA===     Your mark might have sneaky points you never thought about.  For example,maybe your mark would make a good CIA employee.  You could easily find out.Write a letter of application to the agency using your mark's name.  Theagency get hundreds of letters from would-be action agents, such as unemployedgangsters, karate freaks, ex-soldiers, Walter Mitty types, etc.  I doubt thatthey take many of these seriously, but they might be interested in talkingwith a highly qualified technical person, such as an analyst, area expert,journalist with oodles of foreign experience, language expert, or economist.Advanced college degrees and military service abroad as an officer are finecredentials for your mark.  Make up a good solid background.  It is probablyillegal for you to make a false application in your mark's name using phonycredentials.     Send resumes to:  Personnel Representative                       Central Intelligence Agency                       Washington, D.C.  20505     You can also send in an application in your mark's name for a CIA job atthe field office in the nearest city.  Yes, they are listed in the telephonebook.==============CLASSIFIED ADS==============     Classified advertisements in your local newspaper are inexpensive littlebullets that can cause major wounds to the mark's psyche if properly aimed.For instance, suppose you had a score to settle with some bitchy neighbors.You could insert a classified ad to "sell" their automobile.  Price it fivehundred dollars less than market value, instruct callers to call after midnight(shift work is the explanation you can offer), and explain in the ad that quickcash is needed for an emergency.  That will bring in the phone calls.     You can also put your mark's house up for sale.  Again, ask potentialcustomers to either call or visit at hours that will be very inconvenient tothe mark.     The "personals" in newspapers can provide even more fun.  Maybe your markought to advertise for "young boy and girl models to pose for 'art' pictures."You should use his/her home or business telephone here for return calls,whichever would cause more difficulty for the mark.     Placing ads is a snap.  Most newspapers let you do it right over thephone, and most of the ad people I've talked to say they rarely verify aclassified ad.  Take a tip from that and don't make it outlandish.  As with anypractical joke, there has to be a credible amount of reality to the premise forthe sting to work.     While you're thinking of newspapers, don't foget those sexy tabloids andtheir really gross cousins that let readers advertise all sorts of weird sexthings.  I don't know whether any of that is on the level, but it's worthfinding out--in your mark's name, of course.  Maybe you'll be doing him/her afavor.  But somehow I doubt it--there's no such thing as a free lunch.     You might help the mark share his new friends' sexual talents.  Place anad in one of the target audience magazines--the publication that runs veryexplicit and very honest classifieds.  If you're not sure, contact a localsympathizer and ask him/her for help.     You might write you ad copy like this:     "Soft white male aged 35 wants to play with black lady with largebuttocks.  Bi-couples welcomed for Greek and French culture."     You can really make bondage and S/M optional, depending upon reality, thepublication, its audience, and your mark.  You really ought to study the targetpublication before you word the ad.  The kicker is that you will register themark as the sponsor of the classified ad.  Read a section of this book thattells you about using a neighbor's address and the mark's name before you getstarted.     If you decide to run kinky classified ads for your mark in SCREW, BALL,and whatever, be sure you get some copies of the issue in which the ad runs.That way you can send originals or Xerox copies to the mark's neighbors,relatives, business associates, and friends.  Enclose a brief note asking howthey can even admit knowing such a perverted person.  Offer to pray for them.You could use the name and address of another friend, neighbor, or businessassociate as the return address for this note.     Help your mark out of the closet by running a classified announcement adin homosexual publications.  Have her/him grandly and proudly announce that heor she is gay and has dated and/or married only for cover.  Now, he/she iscoming out and telling the world she/he has taken a lover--and name a friend,neighbor, or business associate as that lover.  Libelous?  Yes, it is.  Don'tget caught.     Using classified advertising, Bill Colbeley had an auction for one of hismany marks.  He followed the usual auction format to prepare the newspaper ad,then ran it when the mark and his family were away for a weekend.  The ad wasone of those "Job transfer--everything must go--fanstastic bargains" types sonormal to an industrial community.  But let Sweet Old Bill tell the rest of hisstory:     "I set the time of the auction for 7:00 A.M., so that just as the sleepymark was rolling out of the sack about that hour, he looks out on his yard andsees about three hundred salesgoers out there trampling all over his lawn,garden, and flowers.  It took an hour for the mark and the police he called toget the crowd out of there."     Although it's not strictly a classified advertisement, the littleindex-card notices that people place on bulletin boards in bars, supermarkets,laundromats, and other public places are great ways to harass your mark.  Justabout anything you can use in a newspaper can be used on these more personalnotices.  But the advantages are, they don't cost anything but the timerequired to prepare and post them, and you can be a lot more wordy,descriptive, and personal than you can with a newspaper advertisement.  Folksseem to read these very regularly too, as I know from my personal use of thiscommunity advertising medium with legitimate messages.======CLERGY======     One of the most useful bits of armament in the trickster's arsenal is aset of clerical garb.  Lenny Bruce proved how financially useful this disguiseis when he panhandled Miami dressed in a religious costume.  But then,organized religion has known this for years, profitably practicing their oldproverb "Let us prey."     Obtain and make use of overt religious garb.  It creates a wonderfullysecure and trustworthy image.  Drug marketeers often use priest and nun outfitswhen moving dope.  In Ireland, weapons and explosives are smuggled bykindly-looking middle-aged persons disguised as religious figures.     Your possibilities are limitless.=====COINS=====     If consumer attorney Dale Richards is correct, more Americans lose moneyto coin-operated vending machines than lose money gambling or paying taxes tothe IRS.  What's also astounding is that so few people rise above simplevandalism as a response.     Richards explains, "Many vending companies are quite liberal in theirrefund policy.  They don't question most refund requests.  However, gettingrefunds is annoying to people, it takes time, and the machines shouldn't cheatpeople in the first place."     People who work for vending companies claim that customer vandalism is whythe machines don't work in the first place.  Critics claim thatvandalism-repair cost is built into the price for the goods and services youget from coin-operated machines.  I'm not here to adjudicate this debate, butto pass along some alternative philosophy.     Abbie Hoffman says that every time you drop a coin down the slot of somevending machine you are losing money needlessly.  There are many inexpensiveforeign coins that will duplicate the American version and operate vendingequipment.  It may be tough to get some of these coins, because many legitimatedealers look suspiciously upon attempted purchases of large numbers of cheapieforeign coins.  You could tell them that you use them for jewelry.  Apparently,many coins dealers are establishment snitches, so be careful.     Here, according to Hoffman, are the more useful foreign coins.  TheIcelandic five-auran piece is the most effective substitute for an Americanquarter.  They are hard to come by, since they are no longer minted.  TheUruguayan ten-centisimo coin will also substitute for the U.S.  quarter in avariety of vendng machines, parking meters, telephones, toll gates,laundromats, etc.  It does not work in cirgarette machines.  The Danishfive-ore piece works in just about anything but pop and cigarette machines.     Dime-sized coins include the Malaysian penny, which works in a variety ofmachines and devices that take a dime.  Some of the newer vending machines willreject this dime substitute.  Another ersatz dime is the Trinidad penny.     You might be able to have friends who travel abroad get you rolls of thesecoins for collection purposes or to make jewelry.=========COMPUTERS=========     The computer won't really be human until it can make a mistake, then coverup by blaming the error on some other helpless machine.  More than one critichas pointed out that it is machines, not people, that both run and ruin oursociety.  It seems perfectly proper, then, to seek vengeance against thesetyrannical mechanical masters of ours.  Most of us have the advantage whenfighting a machine, because we can reason, we can note shades of gray, and wecan think abstractly, beyond a set program.  Machines cannot do this, unlesssome person translates these abstractions into programmed sets of yes or no.     The classic way of fighting a computer is to punch a few extra holes inthe computer card.  This, of course, screws up the system, and the computerregurgitates your card.  A supervisor must handle the situation manually, whichcosts money and time.  People punch these extra holes in cards using a keypunchmachine at a nearby school, or they simply and carefully cut a keypunch patternwith an X-acto art knife.     This sticky trick delights repair people, in addition to you.  Place alarge strip of Scotch tape on several computer cards.  The slippery surfacecauses cards to fall off the track and into the bowels of the machine.  Arepair person has to come and perform mechanical surgery on the machine toremove your fatal paper bullets that felled the machine.  This sort of dirtytrick can tie up equipment for several hours of very, very costly down time.     Should the opportunity arise that you have a few secure moments with somereels of computer tapes and you want to screw up whoever or whatever controlsthe data on these tapes, you might try passing a portable electromagnet backand forth across the tapes.  It erases them just the way a bulk eraser cleansoff you audio tapes at home.  In many cases computer-tape records are the onlyrecords kept by many companies and schools.===========CONTRACTORS===========     Just suppose your new home wasn't quite what the contractor ordered andpromised.  If you're lucky, you'll discover this sad fact before he's doneworking on the house.  If not, you'll have to chase him to his next job site.I once went through that many years ago, and it can be fun.     Anyway, here's what you do.  Erect a huge sign on your lot that sayssomething like, BUY THIS UNDER-CONSTRUCTED, POORLY DONE HOME--CHEAP.  Displaythe contractor's name and telephone number prominently.  When he comlains, tellhim you wouldn't think of subjecting your family to the horrors of living insuch a poorly constructed dump, and if he buys it you'll take down the sign.Have a list of things you think are wrong with the house.  You have alreadyshown him your list if you had to eventually resort to the big sign.  Show himagain.  The heading of the list should state his name, address, and telephonenumber along with your general beef about the poor quality of his work,followed by the specific complaints.  Mimeograph this list so your contractorwill think you're handing them out faster than a politician's calling card.It's worked well in the past.  You should get your grievances satisfied.     A man calling himself Hank suggests one for the construction trade.  Hesays that if your mark is building anything from concrete and you or yourallies have access to that concrete before it is poured, add concentratedhydrochloric acid to it.  Hank claims, "I've seen it work--it causes slow butcontinual deterioration of the structure from corrosion."============CREDIT CARDS============     Designed as a credit convenience for consumers and a big profit turner forbusiness, credit cards are impersonal pieces of plastic whose power potentialcan be awesome.  The only way to use a credit card intelligently is to pay offeach month's balance, avoiding the outrageously high interest charges.  Buteven paying on time doesn't always guarantee perfection.     You are dealing with computers when you use credit cards.  God help you ifthe computer rings you up as owing more money than you do or if the computerslaps you with late payment, resulting in an interest charge.  Yes, there areconsumer-protection laws designed to help you.  But as more than a few peoplewill tell you, there is often a great deal of difference between principal andprinciple.     Kathy Ross had a bad time with magazine-subscription service through whichshe ran a credit-card charge.  Not only did her new subscriptions get mixed upwith renewals, but she was charged for items she never ordered.  She followedthe consumer-protection rules, and within seven months she was being billed forfifty dollars in interest charges alone, still didn't have the subscriptionmess straightened out, and was getting dunning letters from the credit-cardcompany, calling her irresponsible.  Computers didn't understand her humanpleas for logical service.  Kathy never did get justice.  She paid the charges,finally giving up because "it was easier."     If you can get the mark's credit-card number, order a huge bunch ofmail-order merchandise for him/her.  Use the telephone to order things too.The secret here, according to a former security agent for one of the cardcompanies, is to keep the amount of each individual purchase under fortydollars, because telephone confirmations are made on greater amounts.  Justmake hundreds of forty-dollar purchases in a short time.     Using the mark's credit-card information to place telephone ordersinvolves some investigation, according to Robert Schoster, a mastermanipulator.  Sometimes, Schuster will simply call the mark's home, pretendingto be a verification clerk at some local credit union or bank.  Schuster givesthe mark's full name and address, then asks the mark or the mark's spouse toplease verify the credit-card numbers.  If it works, and Schuster says it doesninety-nine percent of the time, you are now ready to order all sorts of goodsand services on behalf of the mark.     If you don't have his/her credit-card number and you feel honest, don'tsteal with it.  Go a step beyond and report the mark's card as stolen.Pretend you are the mark.  That will cause some upset for the real mark whenhe/she tries to use the card a week or so later.     This is fraud, but one recycled Yippie who is now billed as a professionalpsychic for the various supermarket tabloids told me how he applied for and gotvarious credit cards merely by lying on his application.  Easily getting cards,he would run the credit to the extreme and beyond on the cards, survive thecorporate dunning letters, then move to a new location without benefit offorwarding address.  Despite my doubts, several corporations I asked deniedthat they passed along these losses to the rest of us in the form of outrageousintrest charges.=======================DELIVERY OF CONSUMABLES=======================  For years kids have ripped off beer distributors' trucks, pizza wagons, etc.The scam is to call the place from a pay phone and give them a fake name insome high-rise apartment.  Give them the pay-phone number and stick aroundthere for a while, since some places call back to confirm orders.  When thetruck arrives with the order, and while he is up there trying to find anonexistent customer, you could help yourself to what's left in the truck.  Why would anyone want rip off an innocent beer-delivery truck or pizza wagon?Fred Littman has one reason, saying "I ordered a pizza at one place locally,and it was awful.  I spoke with the manager, and he told me to get lost andrefused to give me my money back.  I figured I had some free pizza coming tomake up for that."  Lefty Gaylor has another reason:  "We swipe beer from only one distributor,because everyone knows he's a big Mafia type, and they rip off everyone else,so why not steal from them?"  Isn't stealing from the Mafia dangerous?  "Not if you don't get caught, and this one's too dumb to know any better.  Heblames the drivers, and they get mad and figure if they're gonna get blamed,they might as well steal beer from him.  That way we multiply our efforts."  Perhaps the Justice Department could find some use for Lefty and his boys.=============DIRTY OLD MEN=============     If you know some jerk who's a terminal lecher, not just a dirty old man,but a truly, grossly obnoxious swine, the following is a sure-fire methodthat's right on target.  You need either three or four associates, depending onwhether you personally want to go into the field on this one.  One of yourassociates must be a comely young lady.     The drill goes like this.  The mark is told about the young lady.  She isdescribed as being either an unfaithful wife or a hot-to-trot daughter,depending on the age and circumstance.  The mark is told she has eyes andeverything else for him, and that if he wants to have a lot of heavy action,you or an associate will make the introduction.     As you approach the fateful house on the evening decided upon, you oryour associate, acting as a "guide," must stress that the husband or father isa fiery and jealous man and that she takes you on as a secret lover because ofinsatiable lust, etc.  Build up both the sexual suspense and the thrill of theforbidden.  You have to get his adrenaline and imagination cooking really well.     The mark and his guide are at the door and the sweet young thing opens itand moans out a greeting.  She should be dressed--or undressed--in theappropriate fashion.  The mark should have just enough time to wet his lips andsurvey her architectural lines.  About the time his eyes bug is time for thenext act.     Instantly, a large man comes roaring around the corner of the house,bellowing in rage about the honor of his wife or daughter.  The guide screamsin shrill terror, "Run!  Run like hell!  It's the husband [or father]!"     As the mark and guide start to dash away, a couple of shots are fired, andthe guide falls.  As he falls, he screams to the mark, "Jesus, keep running!He's killed me!"  Another shot rings out; then all is silent.     All is not really silent.  The mark's heart is probably thudding againsthis chest like a caged elephant.  It's a great idea to carry on with thisscenario for a few days, with you or another conspirator, who has beenundercover, keeping the mark apprised of the guide's condition from thesupposed gunshot wound.  It would also be good to float the rumor that thefather or husband is spending all his time looking for "the other bastard whogot away."     The mark won't stop his fearful shakes long enough to wonder why thepolice haven't arrested the husband or father.  Maybe, when he does come tothis logical question, he will call the police and ask for protection.  Thisscam turns a lot of corners before the mark finally realizes that he's beenhad.  The police probably won't be as amused as you are, but you'll not knowabout that.  The mark will.     If you know the right street people, and if you're going into dirty tricksyou must know them, you will have trickster access to ladies with socialdiseases.  Some of the veterans of the streets will help you out betweentreatments for a price.  Younger, less-experienced ladies don't know they havethe diseases, but their pimp or madam does.  Think how much fun it would be ifyou could hire one of these venereal versions of Typhoid Mary to dazzle, pickup, and seduce your mark.  This scam has been pulled off successfully by atleast four people I know personally.  It is not that hard if you plan, bargain,and buy ahead.=====DRUGS=====     Once, a very close friend of mine was badly hurt by a former employee whonot only had been stealing from the company, but when the employee left, shesaid and did some terrible things that damaged my friend personally andprofessionally.  Revenge was the best medicince, and he did extract his dose.     He waited a year to get even.  It was worth it.  The woman has moved toanother job in a city about two hundred miles away, in the next state.  Havingaccess to drugs, my friend got a small amount of cocaine and planted it in hercar during a special visit to the other city for just that purpose.  He thenused a pay phone to call police and give them the lady's name.  He told themthat she'd just burned him on a drug deal and that he was turning her inbecause of it.     As this is written, the case is going to court.  Happily for my friend,this female actually had a bit of marijuana on her person when she got bustedfor the planted coke.  Talk about good luck.  The third stroke of luck was thatthis bust took place in New York State.  He has followed the case through theother city's newspaper and through a friend.  He says the police aren't buyingher story of innocence.  The best part is that by now, she can't think ofanyone who would have a motive to hurt her.     Having drugs around is a very dangerous risk.  But if the stakes areright, it can become a very serious business for the mark.  You should knowthat your call to the police will be recorded.  Disguise you voice mechanicallyby using a rerecording tape, or inhale some helium from a balloon just beforeyou make the call, since it will alter you voice totally.  If you're a goodthespian, try to use a foreign or regional accent.  Speak very softly, also.Don't stay on the line for more than thirty to forty-five seconds.  Do yournumber and hang up.     An old head like William Harvey would get a chuckle from this, if he werestill with us to enjoy it.  If his mark was straight or naive about dope, Billthought it was fun to mail him/her bagfuls of chopped weeds, oregano, etc.,with some incense sprinkled on for scent.  As an added touch he included one ortwo joints rolled using the bogus weed, with a note saying, "Enjoy the sampleson me."     These materials were mailed to the mark's home address using a slightvariation in the spelling of the name.  Ideally, the mark thought she/he hadbeen confused as an innocent dupe in a dope deal.  After a day or two, Harveyhad a male with a rough, raspy voice call the mark to ask if some package hadbeen misdirected to him/her by accident.  The caller suggested that other,nastier accidents might happen if the mark did anything uncool like calling theauthorities.  Naturally, the mark already had done this.  What would you expecta mark-type person to do?  After all, that's how people get to be marks.     As a postgraduate version of this scam, Harvey used to send a packagecontaining some suspicious-looking white crystalline powder (sometimes with atouch of brown) using the same bit just described.=====================ENVIRONMENTAL RAPISTS=====================     If you dislike land rapists, such as big developers, big real estaters,gas and oil drillers, etc., then your first order of business is to read EdwardAbbey's THE MONKEY WRENCH GANG, twice.  The first time you read for fun andpleasure; the second reading might be for tactics, as in a manual.  Forexample, if you've had unpleasant dealings with utility companies "creatingprogress" in your area, for example building roads, drilling gas or oil wells,stripping coal, deep mining, etc. you know the feelings.  The monkey wrenchershave an answer.     Note the advice of one of Abbey's protagonists:     "Always pull up survey stakes.  Anywhere you find them.  Always.  That'sthe first goddamned general order in this monkey wrench business.  Always pullup survey stakes."     He should have added that you should always disguise the dirt from thestake hole, tamp it down, and disguise the scar, so the enemy cannot simplyreplace the stake.  A further suggestion would be to move the surveystakes...perhaps enough that a lawsuit could be instituted against theenvironmental rapists.     According to a Cat operator I shared several lemonades with a few times,Karo syrup poured into the fuel tank of heavy machinery is enough to deadlinethe equipment for a thorough bit of maintenance.     "It'll turn to solid carbon, that syrup, and seize the engine up tight.It makes a helluva mess of an engine.  I'd suggest about three to four quartsper tankful.     "Now look, though," he cautioned, his eyes glinting hard enough to stareopen clam shells at a hundred yards, "if you did that to my own machine I'dcome after you hard.  But if it was a company machine or if they'd leased mymachine, hell, I'd probably buy you a drink afterward!"     In the summer of 1978, about 150 angry farmers in Minnesota held abeer-and-hot-dog party to celebrate the coming of the "bolt weevils."  Theparty and the "weevils" cost a utility giant a quarter of a million dollars.     The farmers were fighting mad over the invasion of the huge utilityconglomerates who were running their power towers and lines across thecountryside, ruining farms and dairy operations.  All legal and moral effortsto oppose this land rape failed.  That's when the "bolt weevils" came to thefarmers' rescue.     After beating off state police by using Wrist Rocket slingshots to fireball bearings at patrol-car windows, the farmers brought out their wrenchs andcutting tools.  Soon, after two of the 150-foot-tall, hundred-thousand-dollartransmission towers lay smashed on the ground, victims of the "bolt weevils."     A dozen years ago, these farmers were staunch, conservative Americans,firmly behind "their" government, and they claim that the radicals of thesixties were right.  That's comforting, at last.     One farmer says, "The goddamn government's playing red herring, bleatingabout Arab terrorists and weathermen and the underground.  Hell, it's thepeople -- us, the little people -- they better watch out for.  We're therevolutionaries, and we're ready to fight.     "They may finish this power line and others, but the greedy, land-rapingbastards will never keep it in operation.  There's not enough guards for that.And more people are coming around to our way."     You could almost hear an echo of "All the power to the people," with nothint of a pun.     A major gas company was ripping and raping all over the countryside, usingthe national need for natural gas as its excuse for avarice.  One landownerwhose livestock were distupted by the gas-drilling operation decided to geteven, quietly.     Farmer Dale explained, "I knew a little bit about the state environmentalregulations, so I decided to help the gas company violate as many of them as Icould, even if it mean sacrificing a few things of my own.     "Late one evening, I kicked over the hose from their fuel tank and openedthe valve.  By morning, the result was nearly seven hundred gallons of dieselfuel in the stream below my place.  It took members of the sportmen's clubabout a mile downstream two hours to get state officials out there to the wellsite.  Because of a phone call I'd made earlier, the local newspaper sent areporter, too.     "Later that day, I dumped my barrel of old crankcase oil on the drillingaccess road, and you should have seen the foreman's pickup when it hit thatoil.  He slammed through my cornfield.  I acted really wild, raising hell aboutfirst polluting our stream, then wrecking my crops and spilling oil on theroad.  He was shook up to beat hell and blamed his own truckers for leakingoil.  I billed their company for three-hundred dollars in damages, and heendorsed the bill for payment right there."     Farmer Dale did some other things that week, like move and replace those"Underground Cable" markers used by the power and phone companies to markburied wires.  Naturally, the driller's dozer tore up the real wires, creatingfurther havoc.  He sprayed weed killer on his own crops, within a hundred-yardradius of the gas well, then raised hell witht the state agricultural people.He submitted a bill for a thousand dollars for damaging his crops, although thegas company balked -- at first.     "Finally I dumped some chemicals in my old well and had the water tested(he had had the water tested prior to the drilling, of course) by the county.They reported it had gotten polluted during the time the gas well was beingdrilled.  I turned it all over to my attorney at this time."     His attorney filed to have the drilling permit revoked and also to sue thecompany for huge damage settlements.  The case was settled out of court,allowing the company to finish its rape, yet at a very high price, includingunlimited free gas and a lot of cash for Farmer Dale.     Another combatant in the never-ending war between the land rapists andlandowners or environmentalists borrowed the old OSS tire-spike idea, marriedit to the Malay gate of Indochinese fame, and put some heavy vehicles on theshelf for a while.  Angered because the well drillers for a natural-gas companywere filling their mammoth water-tank trucks from a trout stream that ranthrough his property, a landowner spiked their plans.  He took a two-inch-thickpiece of twelve-inch board and pounded five ten-inch housing spikes through it.The board was about eighteen inches long.  He did the same thing to anotherboard.     The ambush site was the deeply rutted pull-off spot the heavy water trucksused when they sucked thousands of gallons of good water from the clean stream.The giant trucks had callously dug deep ruts, which filled with water fromtheir sloshing loads.  Our combatant placed his spiked boards tips upward, intothe ruts.  He did this on a random schedule over a one-month period, disablinga total of seven trucks and finally forcing the land rapists and their trucksto another fill-up point.     As a postscript, he enjoyed this activity so much that he built dozens ofthe spike devices and became a traveling one-man hit squad, placing the trapswhenever he saw evidence of the heavy water-tank trucks.==========EXPLOSIVES==========     Now that the feds have outlawed fireworks, you'd better save all the M80syou can find.  Extremely versatile devices, M80s are excellent propellants forother substances.  For example, this stunt started out as a dorm prank atClapper Packer University but soon escalated into more deadly sport, which wentlike this.  Put some fresh feces, the looser the bettter, into a large Baggie.Gently break the glass on a large-wattage lightbulb, but do not disturb thefilament.  Even more gently attach the filament to the fuse of the M80.  Screwthe bulb carefully back into a ceiling socket.  Finally, move the bag of fecesup and around the light fixture.  Be certain the fuse and filament do not touchthe feces, but see that the M80 is into the substance.  Tape the bag to theceiling.     Naturally, all this presupposes you have access to the mark's room or to aroom where the mark is likely to be the one who comes in and turns on thelight.  One cautionary note:  Be sure the light switch is off when you screw inthe bulb.  If it's not, you have about four seconds to avoid getting nastycoverage from the M80's blast.  Done correctly, this is a spectacular stunt.As the designer of this one, George Dierk adds, "You don't have to limit yourspatter substance to feces.  Paint, cheap perfume, acid, and CS gas all havetheir place."     Gun powder has a lot of uses in addition to filling up a portion ofcartridges.  If your mark has an outdoor barbecue, you could sprinkle a cup ofold-fashioned black powder around the bottom of the grill.  When the powderignites it will do so with a huge, whooshy flash, accompanied by a great whitecloud of smelly smoke.  I would hate to imagine the multiple effects of such apyrotechnical display on one of those fancy grills powdered by LP gas.  Wow!     Don't let your imagination rest with the cookout grill.  Rememberfireplaces, wood stoves, ovens, etc.  The experts suggest you use black powderrather than the more modern smokeless powders.  Black powder really works!     If you can't get a regular smoke-bomb device, a smoke grenade, orsomething real from the military, make your own.  According to Doctor AbrahamHoffman, the noted chemist, you combine four parts sugar to six-parts saltpeter(potassium nitrate).  You heat this mixture over a very low flame until itstarts to blend into a plastic substance.  When it begins to gel, remove itfrom the heat and allow it to cool.  He suggests you stick a few wooden matchheads into the mass while it's still pliable.  You also add a fuse at thispoint.  The smoke device is nonexplosive and nonflammable.  But a pound of thismixture will produce enough thick smoke to cover a city block.  Watch which waythe wind blows.     John E Warrenburger likes to mess up people's nervous systems.  One of hisfavorite nonlethal tricks involving nonexplosives is a good bit of cardiactheater.     John says, "I bundle a few of those road flares -- the ones in the redjackets -- together and wrap them with black plastic tape.  Connect this withsome coiled wiring to a ticking alarm clock and place it so your mark will getthe full visual and aural effect."     Applause, applause, John.  Only God and the mark's launderer will know howdastardly the frightening effect of the bogus bomb is on the mark's nervoussystem.=======FILLERS=======     Trickster Aynesworth Belin is thrilled with the recent introduction of thesuper-foam products.  These are urethane-and-resin compounds, usually in aspray can, which billow out and expand into a mass at least thirty times theoriginal volume.  They harden quickly, often within five minutes.  Anotherversion is a two-part liquid that when mixed does even more astounding things.One quart will give you the equal of 150 pounds of plaster.     A gallon of super foam will make eight cubic feet of the ultrastrongmaterial, which is water, erosion, and corrosion proof, as well as heat andcold resistant.  The irony is that these products have been marketed by majorcorporations for various legitimate filler jobs.  They rely on advertising andsocietal brainwashing to make certain the lulled citizens use the product onlyfor its duly intended purpose.  If there was ever a product that belongs in thearsenal of the dirty trickster, this one is it.  I took an informal survey offifteen hardware stores in my area.  All had the product in stock.  Yet oneclerk told me, "Most [buyers] are young kids...got no good use in mind."     I bet some of them have a very good use to mind.  What can I say but, "Tryit, you'll like it," even if the mark won't?=======FORGERY=======     Forgery is a fine art form, very useful to the trickster.  During WorldWar II, for example, the British Security Coordination often forgedletterheads, documents, and official cables to thwart Hitler's efforts in theearly dark days of 1939 through 1941.  Some of their efforts were spectacular,especially in South America, working covertly with sympathetic Americanofficials, officially neutral at that time.  Some of their tactics are highlyadaptable to today's dirty trickster.  Full details are yours for the readingin A MAN CALLED INTREPID.  Another excellent reference is THE NEW PAPER TRIP,which will give you everything you need to know about forging to get even.============GARAGE SALES============     Ever have a garage sale?  Ever been to one?  They're incredible, and theyseem to bring out the most in worst people.  Even I, a thick-skinned, terminalmisanthrope, was awed at the gall of some people who demand to see your entirehouse or who pound on your door at 6:00 A.M. to get a "head start" on a garagesale you announced in the paper starting at 9:00 A.M.  Getting the message?     Let's have a garage sale at your mark's residence.  Or let's have it inyour mark's name but at the neighbor's address.  List all sorts of outlandishbargains and tell people you have guns, old china, glassware, and dozens ofinexpensive antiques.  You want obnoxious gawkers, not buyers.  Remember that!Naturally, the mark and/or the neighbor will know nothing of this until thefirst knock on the door at 6:00 A.M.     "I used to get all sorts of odd-hour calls from home-remodeling-and-repairsalespeople at this one local company," recalls Jim Kenslogger.  "I must havecalled them a half dozen times to ask that my name and number be removed fromtheir files.  No luck.  So I decided to change my luck.     "I learned who their chief executive was and pulled the bogus-garage-salenumber on him, complete with newspaper ad.  Then I started calling his home atodd hours, asking if he were the party having the garage sale.  He was reallyout of sorts after about a week of this.     "I stopped, and about ten days later I got another routine sales call fromhis company.  I called right back, asked to speak to that executive, and toldhim I was damn tired of being bothered by his salespeople and could he get themto stop calling me.  He pledged he would and told me wearily, 'Buddy, I knowjust how you feel.  I'll surely take care of it for you.'  I had no troubleafter that, so neither did he."=====GASES=====     A serious dirty trickster should have a supply of ammonium sulfide.  Thisliquid is loads cheaper to buy than milk, booze, or gasoline.  It smells soawful that no one, not even the most terminal of coke sniffers, can stand to bearound it once it has been brought into play.  It may be sprayed or vaporized.Using this stuff as a base, Kurt Saxon offers a very effective formula formaking your own stinkum in his book THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND.  The stuff is sopotent that it should have to be registered somehow with someone.  Phew.  Butit's easy to make, and as long as it's harassing your mark's glands, what doyou care?     A little leave-behind hostess present can be a small, uncapped bottle ofbutyric acid.  Propped near the door you're closing, it will be knocked overwhen the mark enters the room.  Phew.      Crowd-dispersal devices are also good choices for the trickster'sarsenal.  These include spray cannisters, gas grenades, pens, and otherchemical-dispensing weapons.  Many of these items may be purchased over thecounter in some states.  They're generally sold under a variety of trade namesand generally contain CS gas, which is a military version of tear gas.  If youobtain it without undue risk, MACE is an excellent choice.  Many manuals tellyou how to make your own MACE.     You can buy many of these materials by mail order.  Check current shippingregulations and any laws against these devices in your own area first, ofcourse.  One of the best mail-order companies in this business is AmericanColonial Armament, P.O. Box F, Chicago Ridge, Illinois 60415.  If you are orcan appear to be a law-enforcement official you can have access to a veritablesmorgasbord of sophisticated gas weapons by getting a catalog from the F.Morton Pitt Company, at 1444 S. San Gabriel Blvd., San Gabriel, California91776.  Finally, if you prefer to brew up your own gases, get a copy of KurtSaxon's classic book THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND.  He tells you how to do it allin your own kitchen workshop.  You can get his book from Atlan Formularies,P.O. Box 438, Eureka, California 95501.     From Elmer Bill, our gardening editor, comes the charming advice thatspray cans of Raid and other insecticides provide you with an improviseddefensive weapon.  The stuff burns the eyes badly and will fire an eight- toten-foot spray.     This buffet of gaseous ideas is method only.  The rationale behind why youwould use such tactics is your own business, of course.  But at times whenpeople or institutions have done you dirty -- a dose or so of noxious gas mayhelp set the record straight for you.========GRAFFITI========     Contrary to popular belief, some people -- usually the creepy ones youwant for this stunt -- do call names and numbers found in bar restrooms.Harvey Rankin and Festerwald Ray proved this premise in their study SCRAWL ONTHE WALL.  What you learn from them is that you should write you mark'sspouse's first name and phone number and a boldly stated sexual attraction (useyour imagination) in every restroom of every bar in town.  Biker and jock barsare usually the best.     As a follow-up, you can tune in your tape deck to a pop country song, callthe number yourself, and sound drunk.  If you're lucky, the mark will answer.Tell the mark why you're calling and where you got the name and number.  It ishoped that you'll be the only ringer among a large crowd of real callers.     Commercial graffiti are available in a form known as billboards andposters.  You could have posters or billboards printed to announce your mark'scoming out of the homosexual closet.  Or your bogus billboard could announce aconservative political candidate's personal advocacy of gun control, gayrights, blacks, Chicanos, abortion, etc.  Your political candidate may actuallysupport busing.  If so, you billboard for him should indicate his violentopposition to it.  And so on.     Bumper stickers are another form of graffiti.  You can get bogus onesprinted in the same manner as billboards and posters.   Or you can uselegitimate purposes, such as slapping strongly adhesive bumper stickers thatchampion your political canidate -- mark to the painted rear-deck surfaces ofautomobiles in a shopping-mall lot.  It might be fun sometime to sit aroundthinking up other creatively rotten things you could do with bumper stickers toget even with someone.     For example, you could get bumper stickers printed that say, GAY ISGREAT...TRY IT, and place these on the automobiles of local bikers, rightwingers, clergy, and others who feel threatened by homosexuals.  You could getbumper stickers that say, HONK IF YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE TOO, and put them on theautos of marks whom you feel are qualified.  BAN HANDGUNS or HUNT HUNTERSbumper stickers go great on the property of redneck gun nuts.  Or put NRAFOREVER! and JUST TRY TO TAKE MY GUN AWAY! on the property of the simple andmisguided wimps who really think gun control serves any useful purpose.     Other fun bumper stickers can say things like, BEER DRINKERS GET MOREHEAD; SUCK MY TAILPIPE; HONK IF YOU'RE HORNY; HOORAY FOR THE KKK; orDEUTSCHLAND UBER ALLES.  Stickers featuring swastikas or Soviet flags can alsobe used creatively.========HIGHWAYS========     An activist can have fun on the roadway, too.  Can you imagine the damagepossible if one were to substitute a road sign that read, GROSS WEIGHT 15 TONS,for the original sign on a bridge that read GROSS LOAD 5 TONS?  One protestingemployee did this at his employer's Ohio plant and had materials shipments shutdown for eight days.     In World War II, it was common for enemy agents on all sides to turn roadsigns so as to misdirect military convoys, screwing up operations.  The sametactic could be used today, even if your only enemy is some governmental branchor agency.     In the annals of highway history no one has seen the equal of the many lowpoints of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, traditionally arepository for political hacks, Mafia underlings, patronage hogtroughers, andthe terminally incompetent.  M. Harvey Shopp, a veteran political trickster,has all sorts of suggestions for highway fun such as painting sawhorses to looklike official blockades and using them to close highways, bridges, etc.     Another of Shopp's ideas is to produce bogus DETOUR signs and place themat strategic locations where they will be sure to screw up highway traffic.     The road woes of Allen McDonald illustrate the rationale behind thesemoves.  Whenever the county in which he lived did road repair to the bridgenear his home, they always parked their equipment in his yard.  When countyroad scrapers went by, they piled a line of debris high enough to close hisdriveway.  In winter, they also closed his own freshly shoveled driveway, thistime with ice-hard snow and frozen slush.  All calls to county officials wereanswered with only the uncaring and operationally impotent cluckings of thetongue.     "I decided to return some of the favors," McDonald said.  "I began to turnroad and other directional signs around.  I stole a couple of BRIDGE OUT signsin another county and placed them in front of perfectly good bridges in ourcounty.  I once called the local radio station and announced several roadrepairs that would mandate detours -- telling them I was a county road super,of course -- which really screwed up local traffic for a couple of days.     "The upshot is that the county got a lot of nasty calls and even more badmedia publicity, and the county commisioners agreed to investigate theseproblems 'caused' by the road people.  Naturally, in the midst of all this Ialso brought up my beefs about their conduct, offering to testify at thehearings.  All abuses against my property quickly stopped.  So I stopped mycounter-abuse program."     Check the "Joggers" section of this book to learn about the OSS tirespikes of World War II infamy.=====HOMES=====     All sorts of things have homes -- snails, snakes, groundhogs, weasels,Japanese beetles, even marks.  One vengeful way of getting even with a mark isto destroy the moat to the castle of his/her home.  The idea is to hit close tohome, for both physical and the psychological destruction involved.     One example started at the apartment of Pat Konely.  Because the landlordrefused to make needed roof repairs, seceral rainstorms flooded Konely'sapartment, damaging personal property.  The landlord also refused to paydamages, and Konely didn't have the money to fight the landlord's attorney.     Pat Konely admits the response wasn't very funny, but it did put a damperon the mark's day and his own home.  It worked because the mark's front doorhad one of those mail slots cut in it.  Konely says that this stunt workswonders when the mark is not aware of what's going on until the poor dripreally gets the message.  Here's what Konely suggests.  Hook a hose, ideallythe mark's, to the outdoor faucet.  Unscrew the power nozzle so you have thebare hose.  Carry it to the mail slot and quietly fit the bare hose end throughthe slot and into the house.  Got the picture?  Good.  Konely says you justturn on the faucet and hope the mark has slow reactions.  Most tricksters wouldagree that it's hardly sporting to do this when the mark is away from home.     "That would be like shooting puppies in a barrel," Konely snorts.  "Atleast tip the barrel over and give them a running start, so to speak."     If your mark hates cats, be sure to place dead fish in obscure andunpleasant places around his/her abode.  Do this at night.  If you want felineaudio accompaniment, tie a large dead fish from a tree limb or pole just out ofthe reach of the neighborhood cats.  The nearer to the mark's bedroom window,the better.     The modern epoxy glues are a miracle to many and a menace to others.  Thelatter is exemplified by the exasperation of a person who's just discoveredthat someone has squirted a load of strong glue into her/his door lock.(Liquid solder works too.)     You know all those vents in the back and top of a television set?  If youever pour a bunch of iron filings down in there, some interesting things willhappen to the mark's set the next time it is turned on.     How about some party humor?  If your mark doesn't know you're getting backat him yet, you might even find yourself a guest in the target home.  You couldstart off your festivities by quieting yourself away from the crowd, locatingthe family freezer, and either turning the unit down greatly, pulling the plug(unless it's equipped with a safety signal unit), or switching it to defrost.     A trickster by the name of Micki related how she once came bearing giftsfor the mark's family freezer.  She had matched the hostess's freezer wrappingpaper and style perfectly.  Then, nestled among the nice beef roasts, steaks,hamburgers, and chickens belonging to the mark, Micki added her own packages offrozen roadkill -- dead cats, small dogs, groundhogs, and crows.     Happy eating, all you mystery-meat fans.     While doing your tour of the targeted facilities don't forget to dump somefierglass or insulation dust into the mark's washing machine.  It will bepicked up by the clothes, ideally undergarments.  Within half an hour ofgetting dressed, a person wearing clothing impregnated by the fiberglass orinsulation dust will wish he/she weren't.  It creates terrible itching thattakes two or three days to disappear.  The best part is that no one ever thinksto blame the rash on sabotaged clothing.  Repeated doses of this stunt areenough to make a strong mark crumble.  A continual supply of "product" isassured if you mix the nasty dust in with the laundry detergent.     Every real kid knows what sulfur smells like when burned -- horriblyrotten eggs.  Once, some of my peergroup delinquents put some three pounds ofit in a nasty neighbor's furnace, after somehow gaining entry to the basement.The house had to be aired out for nearly forty-eight hours.  It was awesome.If you want some fireworks with your sulfur-in-the-furnace gimmick, throw in amixture of potassium permanganate and sugar.  It will flare, smoke grandly,and, with the sulfur present, stink all the more.     Here is one of Leon Specre's recipe for ill humor.  He hopes you dig it.     Your mark (and family if there is one) is away for at least the weekend,and you know about it enough ahead that you can hire a backhoe operator.  Also,rent a pickup truck and tape a cardboard sign to its door with some vagueidentification on it about a landscaping business.  Smear the license platewith mud or borrow another plate for a short while.     You should arrive at the mark's house about half an hour before thebackhoe.  Naturally, you used the mark's name when you engaged the backhoe andyou told the operator you'd have a landscape contractor (you) there to meethim.  The neighbors should think everything is in order if you act as if youknow what you're doing.     Don't give the backhoe operator a good look at you, and use some disguisekit if possible.  The premise is that the mark wants to add a basement roomsomewhere on the house.  You must tell the backhoe operator exactly where toexcavate.  In most suburban areas, underground utility lines are indicated withaboveground markers.  You can pick up gas lines and water lines from themeters.  Pick an area clear of utility lines and pipes and lay out some stringand stakes.  Do all this before your operator arrives.  Tell him your client,the mark, wants that area excavated and to bill the mark directly.  Further,tell him that you have to leave to pick up your foreman and crew and thatyou'll be back in about twenty minutes.  Ideally, you'll never see the backhoeoperator again.     As Frank Foge points out, "My chemistry teacher always said there'd be apractical use for these high school science courses someday."  She was right.Do you remember what termites look like?  Good.  If not, any insect book willtell you.  Or visit your local Orkin man and tell him you need to obtain sometermite eggs for an experiment.  Or get them from a science-supply house.     I bet you already know the experiment.  It's called how fast can thelittle eggs hatch into hungry termites and devour the mark's house?  There's notrick here; you just infest your mark's home with the little buggers.  They'lldo the rest.  This last one was prompted by a frustrated renter whose landladyrefused to have the cockroaches and other pests exterminated from an apartment.A serious illness to an infant child, traced directly to the landlady'srefusal to follow sanitary laws, triggered the nasty "bugging" by the renter.=======HOOKERS=======     In many cities independent business people have set up a personal servicewhose employees make housecalls.  These paid friends come in all sexes and meetall tastes.  It might be fun to invite one of these hedonistic harlots to"your" house.  Use the mark's name and a neighbor's address.  Try to pick themost upright, puritan neighbor you can find to receive this sexual goodSamaritan -- a professional virgin or librarian; something on that order.     Not all prostitutes carry the Good Housekeeping Seal; some carry venerealdiseases.  These are fairly common among streetwalkers, the bargain basement ofhookerdom.  If you or a trusted friend in law enforcement, medicine, or socialservice can locate one of these carnal carriers and your mark has a weaknessfor ladies, hire her and let her pick up your mark.  Nature, as they say, willtake care of the rest.     I'm certain your vengeful imagination will have no trouble matching adeserving mark with a paid friend who might give him/her more than bargainedfor.  I know a couple of people who set up a cop this way.  The cop wasespecially hypocritical and nasty about honest working girls:  He'd fully andfreely sample the services before busting and totally prosecuting the servicer.He got his, so to speak.======HOTELS======     Suppose you are staying at a hotel and get into a bad beef over the poorquality of the meal you get in their restaurant.  After trying to bereasonable, here is how Ralph Charell, a champion-class advocate for the littleguy, handled it.  Seeing absolutely no satisfaction and no end of snobbishtreatment, Charell took the following steps.  He requested a deposit box in thehotel safe and placed the offending rib roast, which he felt was of poorquality, in the box and locked it.  The box had two separate locks and twoseparate keys.  One was held by the hotel, the other by Charell.     "At this point, the hotel management has absolutely no idea what I'dplaced in the box," Ralph Charell explained.  "I told them it was valuableevidence in a possible legal action I was considering against an organizationwith whom I was having a disagreement about the quality of one of theirproducts."     In a short time, someone at the desk caught the disagreeable odor of decaycoming from the area of the safe.  Within another short time, Charell wascalled by the manager and asked to clear whatever was in the box out of thebox.  Charell explained about the "evidence" in this legal action.  The hotelmanager threatened to force open the box anyway.  Charell reminded him of thelaws against destroying evidence, then explained the whole situation.     "What do you want from me, Mr. Charell?" was the manager's beaten reply.     Ralph Charell then reported the details of the dinner he and his party hadhad at the hotel.  It takes a real expert like Ralph Charell to turn a trickinto something positive for all sides.     In Homer City, Pennsylvania, a group of the locals told about the time afellow had a room at a nearby boardinghouse.  He was the pompous sort ofsmartass who just begged to be dirty tricked.  The locals went to a junkyardand brought a huge gang plow.  It was in pieces and was relatively easy forthese husky lads to put in the mark's rooms.  They assembled it and welded thepieces together with a small, portable machine.  They and their machine left.There was a great deal of consternation on the part of the mark and thelandlord, who parted company faster than the room and the plow.  Automobilesand other bits of large machinery work equally well in rooms and apartmentstoday.     A collegiate trick reported by Whitney Clapper called for hiding smalldead things, such as mice, sparrows, or moles, in out-of-the-way places in themarks rented room.  Good secret places include light fixtures, inside switchboxes, unused overcoat pockets, and inside appliances.  Within a few days, themark will be aware that something is wrong.  A few more days, and he'll besure.  Left unattended, this stunt will provide the mark with a mass of petmaggots to raise.===================INSURANCE COMPANIES===================     In the intelligence business, access to insurace company files is regardedas an operational goldmine.  A former executive explains, "These filescontained detailed analysis of actual and potential weaknesses, trouble spots,and other problems of any sort facing clients.  Insurance companies stand tolose millions of dollars in the event of an actionable accident or difficulty,such as the Three Mile Island fiasco.  Obviously, these very thorough anddetailed investigative data would be of immense interest to a saboteur.  Inother words, these companies want to know the details by which anything andeverything could go wrong with a client.  These data are like a printer onsabotage."     Getting access to these reports and data may not be so easy for thenonprofessional.  But if you have enough dedication and imagination you willfind a method.  The kids who blackbagged the FBI offices in Media,Pennsylvania, were nonprofessionals, and look what they pulled off!  Theymanaged to liberate entire files of illegal domestic espionage, which laterblew apart COINTELPRO, the blackest eye Hoover's FBI ever suffered.     Now let's get to the insurance companies themselves.  Suppose you getturned down for insurance and you want to know why.  By law, the insurancecompany must show you the file it has on you.  Suppose you learn that all sortsof misinformation and other lies are in there.  There are organizations andlawyers that deal in just that sort of thing, and a load of simultaneouslawsuits for such things as invasion of privacy and slander would be great.     Deborah Bodenhead hates junk mail, especially mail-order insurancehustles.  So she answers these requests with affirmative orders; "I'll buy,"she tells them.  Then she runs salespeople and clerks through all sorts ofscheduled, broken, rebroken, etc., appointments.  She settles finally on apolicy, then waits for the second billing to cancel.  Why the second billing?     "They rarely send out the policy before the first billing," Deborahexplains.  "I want them to go to the expense of preparing and processing thepolicy.  I usually get a second bill with a polite dunning letter.  That's whenI cancel.  It drives the salespeople to anguish every time.  Usually when theywhine and ask me why, I just tell them I really hate mail-order advertising andjust decided to cancel on a matter of principle about junk mail."     I asked an insurance agent about this stunt, and he cursed people likeDeborah, saying these people drove our rates up.  I asked him if it wasn'treally the companies' own obnoxious marketing techniques that drove up rates!He cursed me, too.     Don't ever pity or sorrow for insurance companies.  They make more profitin an hour than any of us make in salary in a year.===IRS===    Mark Mertz knows a few special things about the Internal Revenue Service --it can be used to furnish a hard time for your mark.  Mertz knows his wayaround government agencies, and here's one of his IRS offerings.    "You'll need your mark's Social Security number and some other obviouspersonal data.  Once you get those data you're on your way.     "Call a regional IRS office and 'confess' that you have cheated on yourincome tax, you conscience has bothered you, and you want to make things rightby this great nation.  Make an appointment with an auditor, using your mark'sname, Social Security number, address, etc."     The kicker comes when the mark doesn't show up to keep the appointment,for obvious reasons.  The IRS will send a visitor around to talk with the mark,and chances are he will be audited, regardless of his explanations.     So much for using IRS to hassle your mark.  Many more folks would preferthe IRS were the mark.  As in dealing with any large bureaucracy and itspeople, many of the stunts mentioned in other chapters may be brought to playagainst the IRS.  However, there are a few specefic tricks that may be used tobring rain on the IRS picnic.     You could start by picking up a bunch of blank returns and filing them inthe names of your least favorite people.  I have been assured by a former IRSfield auditor that someone will have to make an effort to verify each return.     With the help of your printer and your newly found forgery skills, preparesome financial documents indicating that some person or corporation hasreceived some substantial income.  Make copies of copies several times untilyou have a fifth- or sixth-generation copy that is not too clean but is stilleasily sharp enough to read.  The idea is to make it look like copies of apurloined original.  Call an IRS office from a phone booth and tell them youare an honest employee of the mark and you think he is evading taxes.  Offer tosend the IRS person the papers.  Get off the phone very quickly, then send thepapers.  If the IRS gets nasty they may find themselves in court.  I got thisidea from a man who worked for a company that did fight IRS in court and wonbig -- through an honest IRS error.  Think what could happen to IRS if you fedthem a dishonest error!================THOMAS JEFFERSON================     A quote by Thomas Jefferson can be used to confuse your friends or criticsif they question your activities as a dirty trickster.  A very sharp man whowould be as upset with things in America as you are, Jefferson is quoted assaying, "Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God."     Let the authoritarians and their domestic gestapo choke on that one.  It'senough to make them thump a few Bibles.  What would be Thomas Jefferson's viewson revolution, anarchy, busing, the draft, marijuana, and excessive taxation?=======JOGGERS=======     Overweight and overwrought motorists drive by in their Detroit Dinosaurs,pass a jogger, and mutter, "Damn stupid schmuck."  It's the human way to hatewhat and whom you don't understand.  Joggers are often thought of as nuts,oddballs, and kooks to be dealt with.     Marty Jones, a landowner, is more specific, saying, "They run across acorner of my property, using a path I put in for my own use.  I posted theland, but they ignored the postings.  I have tried to talk to them, but theymay or may not even stop to listen.  If they stop they keep running in placewhile I'm raising hell about trespass.  I think most joggers are rude,self-centered, and selfish.  I was thinking about hiding in the bushes andambushing them with my kid's BB gun."     For a variety of reasons, many people don't like joggers.  Some folks evenactively plot against joggers, using cars and motorcycles, then armingthemselves with boards, pies, and other objects with which to strike therunners.  There are less barbaric ways, however.     Tire spikes are a World War II relic.  During the hostilities, they weredumped from low-flying aircraft onto enemy airfields and main transportationroadways, where they caused havoc.  Your use may not be so widespread, but withequally exasperating results.  The tire spike is a simply made piece ofone-eighth-inch-thick steel cut in the form of a four-pointed star.  Itspurpose is to puncture rubber tires.  The original wartime models were threeinches in diameter and had four points at forty-five-degree angles.  One of thepoints always stuck upward, ready to impale a vehicle tire.  Even today, thereare many uses for tire spikes.     One anti-jogger has already suggested that these spikes be reduced in sizeand dropped strategically near the running habitat of these long-range exercisebuffs.  The purpose, I presume, is to penetrate the expensive bottom ofexpensive jogging footwear and, perhaps, the expensive foot of the jogger.  Onecritic called this tactic "a really sick pain in the metatarsus."     Ultrathin piano wire strung shin high on a pathway is excruciatinglynasty.  That's another World War II stunt redrafted for this book by ColonelJake Mothra.  Many military manuals offer equipment and directions, he adds.     Another contribution to joggermania would be to sprinkle marbles on theirspecial little pathways.  Another nasty trickster, Hidell Crafard, told meabout an acquaintance at the Hunt Sporting Club in Dallas who actually putground glass into the running shoe of a bitter enemy.  Perhaps that's wherefilet of sole originated.     There aren't many counteractivities a jogger can use in retaliation.  Onceis to carry MACE for obvious use.  Another tactic is to carry cans ofgarish-hued spray paint.  These can be directed against attackers' automobiles.===========LAUNDROMATS===========     In addition to the dryer for a pizza oven, as outlined in another sectionof this book, you can use laundromats to harass an individual mark, or thebusiness itself can be your mark.  It is not very hard, for example, to dumpseveral packets of dye into someone's wash, ruining his/her clothing.  Doingthis at random will bring grief to the owners of the laundromat.  Oneantisocial chap used to put small piles of moistened rust particles in thedryer used by his mark so the mark's clothing would have large rust stains.Roadkill may also be used to good advantage in these operations.     Additives that are positive ingredients for a good time at the laundromatincludes raw eggs, fish, peanut butter, and fiberglass.  If your mark is theoperator of the business, you will find a variety of his/her ancillary servicesto bugger, including vending machines, customer seats, and restrooms.  Smallnails or staples driven partly into seats, and restrooms.  Small nails orstaples driven partly into chairs make good items for customers to snagthemselves and their clothing on, for example.  And vending machines can bemade to steal money from patrons.====LAWN====     Our outdoor correspondent, Lother Gout, came up with a scheme to hassleyour mark's lawn.  It's a simple matter of spilling quantities of tomcat lureon the targeted lawn.  The urine of Felix Domesticus will do wonders for thelawn and the mark's disposition.     There are also a number of commercial lawn-care products that may used togood advantage by the serious dirty trickster.  One stunt is to select a large,open chunk of you mark's lawn.  Using concentrated weed killer, you spellsocially offensive words on the lawn with the defoliant.  The grass dies, and anasty word or legend is spelled out for all the neighbors to see.  This worksbest on a slight slope facing a street for maximum exposure.  Salt or vinegarwill work almost as well as commercial vegetation killer.  If you're the sortof fun person who's read this far, I'm certain you'll need no suggestions as towhat to say in your little message.     Serious defoliation is one of the many techniques our Vietnam experiencesmade available to the dirty trickster.  Defoliation is the most potent way toget back at dastardly people who also have unreasonable pride in their lawnsand ornamentals.  These are usually the type of fussy people who also ownsmall, yipping, bitchy dogs the size of rats -- more on that later.     This time we're going to take out everything that grows.  There are manycommercial products available that will kill anything growing.  Look on thelabel to see that it says the stuff is nonselective and/or that it makes thesoil barren.  You just load up your sprayer -- or the mark's, if you can get toit -- and fire away.  Like a good guerilla, pick out what he loves most and hitit first and heaviest.  Don't leave a single blade or stem standing.  Noprisoners.  Be cautious, though, that you stay upwind from the spray.  At nightyou can't tell how much of the gunk you are inhaling or getting on your skin.We have enough Agent Orange victims without adding you to the list.     Reinhard Ray, a former special-operations man for the U.S. navy, suggestsa selective use of the weed killer in a psychological battle against a mark whois a true worrier, fringing on paranoia.  You apply the solution fairly heavilyaround the mark's natural or LP gas meter; then, broadcasting a bit morelightly, you follow the fuel line directly to the mark's house.  A final,heavier dose would be appropriate at the jointure of home and line.  Within afew days the frightened mark will be convinced that his entire gas system isleaking badly.  Obviously, this is effective only if your mark's house usesnatural or LP gas.  But you could also do this to a water-supply line cominginto the house or a buried electric line.     A related scam would be to spray the stuff in a circle around the house.Then, on bogus official letterhead you've either duplicated or had printed,send the mark a letter from the Nuclear Regulatory Commision explaining howthey've just discovered some long lost records revealing that the mark's homewas built over a former repository for nuclear wastes.  I'm sure yourimagination can embellish the rest of the letter's content to convince the markthat he, his family, and home are now radiation victims.  Obviously, you can'tuse this if the mark's house is more than twenty years old, because nuclearwaste dumps weren't built much before then.=======LAWYERS=======     Punxy Phil Ferrick decided to get back at a dishonorable attorney whodecided to try hoodwinking the public by becoming a politician.  Ferrick gothold of the attorney's legal letterhead and got it duplicated by a printer whowas equally outraged at this crook's trying to capitalize his larceny bybecoming an elected thing.     Using the letterhead for starters, Ferrick sent out blatant dunningletters over the mark's signature demanding campaign contributions frompolitically sensitive people.  Another mailing was a group of threateningletters to local civic, church, and charity groups about their winked-atillegal bingo and 50/50 fundraisers.  In the bogus letter, the lawyerthreatened action.     The bogus mailings made the local newspaper when the lawyer -- who hadbeen a big booster, campaigner, organizer, etc., for Nixon in '68 and '72 --complained of the dirty tricks.  The newspaper treated the story straight:  Theattorney's denials only aroused more suspicion.  And no one ever suspectedFerrick...until now.     Another scheme is this:  Get a blank deed of trust, fill in your mark'sname and address, use your notary seal, and you have a legitimate-looking phonydocument.  File it at the courthouse, and you have an action in the worksagainst your mark.  It means the mark has defaulted on a mortgage or some otherpromissory note and that "you" are filing against it.  "You" can be an attorneyif you wish when "you" sign this form.  Days of frustration, anger, andbureaucratic disbelief directed at the mark will follow before things arestraightened out.  Don't get caught doing this one.  The best point here isthat no one ever does things like this illegally, so the bureaucrats will neversuspect it as a dirty trick.     But there's more.  If you have access to a law library or law-librarymaterials, you can play games with the mark's mind, claims Oswald Helms, anobserver of the legal scene.  He suggests, "Law libraries have standardizedlegal-practice forms, form books, and routine stationary forms that lawyers,clerks, judges, and the like use to help draft legal letters and proper legalforms.  A dummy form or letter, photostated with some dummy legal notices,using, for example, arrest warrants, summonses, condemnations, search warrants,etc., can often pass for the real thing.  It will shake the mark very much.     "The secret behind this," Helms explains, "is that real legal peoplesometimes use the Xerox machine and routine forms, too.  It saves time andmoney.  It will easily fool the target and will probably force his or herattorney to at least follow it up."     Time and money, time and money.  Good torting.==============LICENSE PLATES==============     There are many sophisticated and clever ways to obtain additionalvehicular license plates that aren't registered in your real name.  However,it's not necessary to fool around with all that esoterica.  Be like a streetpunk and simply steal what you need.  A bad guy who needs a plate simplyremoves one from someone's car or truck.  That simple.  This is also highlyillegal.  But if you're careful and use a bit of common sense, can you think ofa simpler and safer way of getting the extra plates you need for dirty tricks?=======MA BELL=======    Did you ever see those office signs that say, THINK?  In onetelephone-company office I visited, I saw signs saying, SNEER.     People have been messing with Ma Bell for as long as that corporatedictator has been monopolizing telephone service.  For years stories have beencirculated about using strips of Scotch tape on coins, which allows their useagain and again in pay telephones.  Do you know what a number-fourteen washerwill accomplish in a pay telephone?     The Yippies and other groups have developed marvelously ingenious ways ofsabotaging telephone-company operations.  Some of their literature is sheertechnological genius, almost as if it were written by a Bell Laboratorisdropout.  I once spoke with a radical who had become a "mole," an agent of hispolitical beliefs who secreted himself away in five years of deep cover workingas a technician for Illinois Bell.  His purpose was to learn about thetechnical side of the company so he could later control or destroy telephoniccommunication.     Gordon Alexander presents an alternative manner, simple but novel in thesecomplex days.  A professional dirty trickster for more than twenty years,Alexander uses the dangerous but simple method of physically cutting telephonelines.  If you are looking for instructions on how to safely cut Ma Bell'slines here, forget it.  Unless you know what you are doing and have the properequipment you could easily light up like an insect hitting an electric bugtrap.  I said it was simple; I didn't say it was easy or safe.     Lee Jenner, an accountant, suggests that you overpay your telephone billif you're alienated from Ma Bell.  He says, "Overpay by a constant seventeencents a month.  Make it consistent.  Then, after a few months, underpay byseventeen cents.  Start another pattern for a while of overpayment; thenunderpay again.  It drives them nuts."     Jenner continues, "The local telephone company had screwed a client ofmine and refused even give him the time of day.  He started this seventeen-centbit, and before the year was out he had the manager of the local companybegging him to stop.  It worked totally to his satisfaction."     Meanwhile, on other battlefield fronts, Bell-hater Leo Garry says youshould have your printer make a bunch of OUT OF ORDER signs with the local MaBell's logo on them.  Hang them on every public telephone you find.  Speakingof pay telephones, only punks and idiots damage them.  Much as you may hatethem, they're the only game in town.  If you've ever needed a pay phone in anemergency, you know what I mean.     You can play games with your local service representative (Ma Belltalk forsalesperson) by ordering phones and equipment for marks or ordering serviceshutoffs.  Always make these type of calls from a pay phone, for obviousreasons.     Bandit calling may have been developed by the Yippies.  Certainly they areamong its champions, both as practitioners and as cheerleaders.  Aside from theblue boxes, which make free calls for you, there is a tactic that can be usedby the nontechnical wizard and doesn't cost you anything.  It's the use of thebogus credit-card numbers, and it works like this.     Always use a pay telephone and not always the same one.  Next, you need acredit-card number.  Here is where knowledge of Ma Bell's codes comes in.  Forthat information check OVERTHROW, a tabloid published by the YouthInternational Party.  A subscription cost you ten dollars a year, but eachissue contains all sorts of other dirty tricks, as well as an updated listingof not only Ma Bell's codes, but also the complete credit-card numbers for manycorporations, public utilities, and government agencies.  To order asubscription, send ten dollars to Overthrow, P.O. Box 392, Canal StreetStation, New York, N.Y. 10013.  It's a good investment, according to mostreaders.     After you get credit-card codes or numbers, the Yippies claim, the rest ofbandit calling is simple.  You simply dial the long distance operator from yourpay phone and sound very, very businesslike when you say, "This is a creditcard call, and my number is [give the operator the credit-card number].  I wantto call [give the operator only the number of the party you are calling]."  Besure you can tell a suspicious operator the area code from which the card wassupposedly issued.  If the operator wants to know who holds the card, eithermake up a legitimate-sounding company name or use the name of the agency orcompany whose card number it really is, depending upon the circumstance.  Ithelps if your party at the other end of the call knows what's happening.     Talk straight and businesslike for the first five minutes, as a snoopyoperator -- that's the way Ma Bell trains them -- might stay on the line thatlong to listen in.  Avoid sensitive subjects like your name, politics, drugs,or dirty tricks since you never know who is recording calls these days.  Breakoff the call within twelve minutes.  Obviously, your callee should act verydumb when Ma Bell's security people do come to investigate a month or so afterthe fraud is discovered.  And don't let them intimidate you or your friends,either.  They're good at that -- many of them are former federal or statepolice.     One Bell employee told me that their security people utilize warrantlesswiretaps, blackmail, and physical surveillance to catch persons suspected ofmaking bandit calls.  The employee also told me these tactics are used againstpersons who even publicize such practices.  I consider myself warned.  Soshould you.  Ma Bell can be one nasty mother.     By the time you read this, though, the game may be up.  In Washingtonstate, the Supreme Court there upheld the conviction of a newspaper forpublishing the telephone company's secret codes.  The telephone company, whichhas both security and propaganda sections that rival the government's, wasworking furiously behind the scenes to influence the verdict.     Abbie Hoffman suggested this next trick, so if it doesn't work, call him.Restrict Hoffman's idea to corporate, utility, or institutional telephonesystems.  Cut the female end off an ordinary extension cord.  Unscrew themouthpiece on the telephone in any one office.  You will see a terminal for ared wire and one for a black wire.  Attach one of the wires from the extensioncord to the red and one to the black.  Finally, plug the extension cord into apower socket.     According to Hoffman, you are sending 120 volts of electricity backthrough equipment designed for six volts.  He says this will knock outthousands of other telephones and the main switchboard, "if all goes right."Even if his numbers are somewhat exaggerated, you've had a good day.====MAIL====     The Ku Klux Klan has some interesting strategies for spreading terror.One of these is to collect from regional newspapers clippings of unsolvedarsons (or robberies, rapes, burglaries, assaults, etc.).  If you need tofatten the file, include clips from national publications too.  Place the clipsin a manila envelope and tape it to an old gasoline can (or ax, bra, shotgunshell, jimmy bar, etc.), which you leave on your mark's home or officedoorstep.     David Williams is the pen name of a Texas state legislator who spends hisworking hours as a freelance writer.  He told about Jim Boren (pen name of afriend), whose great idea for practical joking was to send single-entendrepostal cards bearing personal, sexual, or medical messages to William's home.     "Since I met Jim Boren, I hide from my postman," Williams notes.     Williams is not Boren's only victim.  Many of his friends suffer frompostal cards such as the bogus Playboy Towers Memo that pointed out, "Davieboy, thanks for taking care of my friend while she was in Austin.  I wasenvious when she told me how things went down.  Love, Elvira."     Or this hotel postcard came from Hong Kong, addressed to Williams via hispen name at his real address:  "She's no longer at the topless bar.  But hersister at the massage parlor thinks she went to Seoul.  I can pursue it at theembassy, but will have to disclose your personal interest.  Please advise."     It is signed by J. Harley, identified by a return address as "Harley'sDetective Agency" in New Orleans.  There is no Harley, no agency, no nothing atthe return addresses.     Jim also sends cards to people's wives.  One said:  "Sorry, couldn't makeit this time.  My wife came along."     One of Harley's better efforts at postal assassination was this gem, sentfrom Toronto:  "Thanks for your help with the bail money.  You done better byme than President Nixon did by his boys for doing about the same thing.  If Iget the book thrown at me later, I'll ride it out, but I want a writtenagreement on the money and I don't want you saying ugly things about me in thepapers if they learn about your personal role in this."     From Cleveland, Jim Boren sent David Williams this postcard:  "The copsfound your name and address in one of the girls' diaries.  They may be in touchsoon.  -- A friend."     This next stunt is also accomplished through the mail.  Posing as amedical researcher, Elmer Surehe says, you can probably con some crablice eggsfrom a supply house, for a price, of course.  The eggs are inserted with aninnocuous business letter into an envelope addressed personally to the mark.When the mark opens and unfolds the letter, the lice eggs drop onto his/herclothing and surroundings.     It would make sense that nothing in this letter connect back to you, ofcourse.  Some people have used the name and return address of another mark.The resulting confusion will ensure that two marks are unhappy.     A critic felt that this tactic would be unfair because an innocentsecretary, business associate, or spouse might intercept the letter and receivethe dose.  Two observations -- first, people shouldn't read personal mailaddressed to other people; and second, sometimes the innocent must scratchalong with the guilty.     A pulled-punch version of the lice-eggs letter is to use itching powderinstead.  It's easily available from novelty stores, or you can make your ownfollowing the directions printed in some of the formula books available.Sneezing powder is another alternative.     A suggestion for a nastier ingredient came in from a former agent of theAmerican intelligence community who got paid a lot of money for planning andimplementing things like this.  He suggests a chemical tear-gas powder heavilylaced into an envelope, noting, "It will clear a mailroom or an office inminutes."==========MAIL DROPS==========     These are essential if you're going to carry on any sort of correspondencewith a mark or with suppliers of services and equipment.  Depending upon thecircumstances, you will need either a postal box or a regular street-addressmail drop.  Post-office boxes may be obtained in any name, although you willhave to present some identification documenting your "identity."     If your scam is a short-termer, pick an apartment with many little boxes.Choose an empty one, claim it for the duration, and have it checked daily.  Putin your little name card and use that exact address on your returns.  Themail-delivery person doesn't know or care who comes and goes.  Or you can havea very cool and trusted friend front their address as you as a mail drop.However, this person must be prepared and capable of carrying off a veryplausible denial.  You'd better think this one through before involving anotherperson.  Deniability can be a tough rap for an amateur.========MARRIAGE========     Marriage (catch)     Carol Sludge and a friend decided they should stage manage an entirewedding for a mark.  So they did.  She handled the gown and bridesmaids'goodies, and he did the satorial bit for the men.  They got invitations andarranged for a church, a reception hall, a caterer, and an orchestra.  They didit all in the name of the mark and his fictious spouse to be.  They chose atime when the mark was on vacation to send out invitations for the Sunday themark was due back in town.  Everyone showed up for the ceremony -- everyone butthe "bride and groom."  Guests were somewhat miffed, and merchants and othersdescended upon the mark at his place of business Monday morning, wanting to bepaid for goods and services.     Beyond that, what do you turn to after the old standard buns of wreckingthe marriage ceremony have been batted around the bachelor-party table?  Hereare some quickie suggestions, brought to you by the Reverend Robby Gayer:     1.  Hire a woebegone lady with a young child to troop into the receptionand confront the groom-mark with the question of his continued child-supportpayments.     2.  Hire an outstandingly healthy young wench who is just brimming overwith sensual physical charm.  She should cause heads to turn if she's costumedcorrectly as she vamps up to the groom-mark and plants wet soul kisses on him,cooing, "Don't forget our past, love.  And when you're tired of that littlegirl next-door, you know where to find me."  As she leaves, she stage whispers,"Last [night, week, whatever] was just super.  Don't be such a stranger --you're too much man for that."     3.  Call the church office before the ceremony and say that a crazedex-lover of the bride plans to destroy the reception.  Just as the receptionbegins, arrange to have many M80s or grenade simulators exploded.     4.  Consider bringing additives into play with the punch and the food.     5.  Hire someone, grief stricken at the loss of the bride or groom, tomessily and dramatically "attempt suicide" at either the ceremony or thereception.  Be sure to have associates to carry the victim out quickly for"medical attention."     6.  Hire someone to become physically sick during the ceremony or thereception.  With luck, you can get a member of the wedding party to do this.     7.  Use many additives in the groom-mark's drinks during the prenuptialbachelor party.     8.  Hire someone to slowly and dramatically flash the minister for theback of the church while everyone else is facing front.  This also works wellif there is a singer in the choir balcony.  Try to upset him or her during asong.     9.  Call the state police or the drug-enforcement people and give them acomplete discription of the car that will carry the bridal couple on thehoneymoon.  Report that the couple and the car are really dope mules, that is,couriers of the drug trade.=====MEDIA=====     The mass media -- newspapers, radio, television, and magazines -- can behelpful tools in getting even, or they can be your mark in a dirty trick.  Isuggest you keep your media-as-tool aspect relegated to local events and localmedia.  In general, newspapers tend to be conservative and stodgy and not muchinterested in your rousing of the rabble.  Most newspaper officials play golfwith corporate officials, and their common bond are advertising and profits.     Television likes good, visual consumer stories, and local TV stations willgo for local controversy more often than will local newspapers.  Here are somebasic suggestions for using the media to help you in your getting-evencampaigns.     If the editor says the event is news, then it goes out to the public asnews.  People don't make news; editors make news.     To impress editors you have to keep coming up with fresh action.  You haveto be visual, outrageous, funny, controversial, and brief.  Your message has tobe catchy, visual, and packaged to fit ninety seconds of time in the six- oreleven-o'clock news slot.  It's no wonder long-winded academics end up with"Viewpoint," or "Talk Out" at 3:00 o'clock Monday morning.  They don't know howto use TV.     Now, how do you get even with the media when they deserve it?  There areseveral things you can do:O     Take or phone in a fake wedding story, being sure to give them a legitimate-looking bride-groom photo.  It doesn't matter who the people in the picture really are.  Most smaller and medium-sized papers will publish without checking, which could lead to all sorts of wonderful things if you've been inventive in your choice of marriage partners.O     Use a low-power mobile transmitter to add little bits of original programming to your community's commercial radio station.  Some people did this in Syracuse, New York, and drove officials crazy with hilariously obscene fake commercials, news bulletins, etc.O     Newspapers often have huge rolls of newsprint in relatively unsecured storage areas.  It is a low-risk mission to insert paper-destroying insects or chemicals into those rolls.O     Some small radio stations are often loosely attended at night.  Often, only the on-duty DJ is around, and even he will have to go to the can sometime.  You might be able to wait until then or have an accomplice distract that DJ while you place a prerecorded cassette with a message of your own choosing on the air.O     With smaller newspapers, it is sometimes easy to get phony stories and/or pictures published.  Using you imagination, you can certainly cause a variety of grief with their crime.     According to media consultant Jed Billet, if you have a financially weakradio station in your area, you can often place ads for your mark over thetelephone.  Agreeing, Eugene Barnes recalls, "A couple of years ago, I wantedto get back at a doctor who'd really screwed up my family with some terriblebehavior in a business dealing.  So I designated him as my mark and had him'open a pizza business.'  I called the radio station and had them run asaturation campaign of twenty-five spots per day listing his name and homeaddress and telephone number, plus all sorts of promotional gimmicks, like freedelivery, free Coke, stuff like that.  He had to have his telephonedisconnected for a week.  The station ran the ads for a day and a half beforethe doctor got them pulled.  He had 'customers' off and on, though, for thenext ten days."     Newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV are businesses, very concerned abouttheir profit-and-loss statements.  Sales, both of advertising and of audiencefor that advertising, are vital to the media.  Knowing this, old media hand BenBulova has a scheme that works well most of the time.     "Most newspapers will start a subscription with a telephone call," Bulovasays.  "You call in and order a subscription in your mark's name and address."     The next step, Bulova explains, is to call the mark and, using the realcirculation manager's name, tell him that you are with the circulationdepartment of the newspaper and that they're going to give the mark a freetrial subscription.  That way, when the papers start to arrive, the mark thinksthey're free.  When the bill arrives, the mark will call the real circulationperson.  That conversation would be interesting to hear.     Bulova says that this will work with magazines and trade publications, aswell.  He advocates an entire string of such gifts.=======MEDICAL=======     Either steal real medical test-report forms from a hospital, clinic, orlaboratory or have a friend get them for you.  If this doesn't work, a trustedprinter will make some for you.  You will also need matching return-addressbusiness envelopes to mail the reports to your mark.  Get some technical advicefrom a medical textbook or a very trusted friend with a medical background,then prepare a series of embarrassing lab reports for your mark.  This couldinclude positive identification of such problems as venereal disease, drugdependence, cancer, yeast infection, or mental illness.     The mailing of the bogus report must be coordinated with a telephone callto the mark's spouse, employer, parents, parole officer, etc.  Doctor MiloWeir, who helped with this idea, recommends that multiple copies of thediognostic report copy could be sent to public-health officials, and adrug-problem might go to the state narcotics bureau.     If you're waiting in a doctor's examining room you will probably see allsorts of goodies stacked around -- syringes, common drugs, medical equipment,maybe a diploma or two.  A couple of Yippies said they used to makeappointments complaining of vague symptoms just so the could rip off goodies.Beyond simple pilferage, the opportunity exists here for introducing additivesto various products.     This should tickle the fancy of those true sadists among you.  It comesfrom the Olde Medical Almanak of Doctor Jerrold Andurson.  He removes some ofthe Preparation H from the regular container and refills that with tabascosauce.  Andurson guaratees that this will give your hemorrhoidal mark one ofthe hottest seats she/he could feel.     Andurson adds, "That reminds me of the observation made by the man whocaught his genitalia in a bear trap.  He said that the second worst pain in hislife came when he came to the end of the trap's chain."     One summer, Will Gressle had the misfortune to be incarcerated in ahospital wing run by a nurse who made Doctor Josef Mengele seem like SantaClaus.  An easygoing sort, Gressle was driven to revenge by this nastyBrigadier of Bedpans.  Here's what he did about it.     "In late November I was visiting my uncle's ranch in Idaho, where heraises a few sheep.  I got about seven pounds of farm-fresh sheep droppings andput it carefully in an opaque, airtight plastic sack," he relates.     "I put that in a box, wrapped it in bright Christmas paper, and stucklittle happy-face and Christmas decals all over it.  Then I wrapped all that inheavy brown paper and mailed it to the nurse, in care of the hospital.  I put afake return address on the package and a few holiday stickers on the outside,too.     "I'm sure the parcel arrived at the hospital, where they have a littletree in each wing and a small exchange of presents.  It is my sincere hope thatNurse Nasty unwrapped my gift in front of a lot of nurses, doctors, andpatients.  She would finally get to the bag of sheep shit and a little note,which read, 'Just returning a tiny little bit of what you are so fond ofdishing out in great amount,' signed, 'A Former Inmate.'"     Considering that the major side effect of medical treatment these days isterminal bankruptcy, it is little wonder that the medical institutions andpersonnel have become the target of so much getting-even thinking.  In speakingwith people on both sides of this fight, I have concluded that there are onlylimited stunts you can direct against these specific targets.  Yet the range ofregular stunts presented in a dozen other chapters of this book are aseffective against medical institutions and people as against any other subject-- perhaps more so, given the self-held exalted status of the medicalcommunity.     For example, it's one thing if your mark is a contractor and suffers froma venereal disease because of your getting even -- but think how it would workfor a doctor!  Gossip travels fast in the medical corridors.     However, if you are thirsting for a few little goodies to toss at themedical community, here's a mini-list of suggestions:O     Leave dead vermin at strategic points of a particular medical facility -- near the coffee shop, the kitchen, the emergency room, the visitor's lounge, etc.O     Dressed in whites or other appropriate uniform, slip in with cafeteria or kitchen help and put some harmless food coloring into foods.  Or if you can get in to where the staff food is prepared, more powerful additives may be used.O     Borrow some medical-insurance identification from a cooperative friend or otherwise obtain someone else's identification.  Use this to charge medical bills, either real or imaginary.  The point is to get bills sent to a totally innocent or totally unaware third party.  If it's your friend, he or she is part of the scam and will pretend to be outraged about the whole business. Either way, the medical facility is the real mark.========MILITARY========     The canard that began World War II in Europe was based on the tenets ofdirty trickery.  On 1 September 1939, a group of what appeared to be Polishsoldiers attacked a German radio station near the two countries' borders.  In"self-defense," German units then fired upon Polish units in Danzig.     That stunt actually started World War II.     The so-called aggressors who attacked the German radio station wereactually inmates from German concentration camps, dressed in Polish armyuniforms, driven from Germany to the radio site near the border and injectedwith the lethal drug skophedal.  The dying men were spread out in what appearedto be a firefight scenario and riddled with bullets by German SS men.  A fewwho survived told the story.  The German code name for this "military"operation was Canned Goods.     While serving as a guest of Uncle Sam, I had some intelligenceassignments.  There I found out that there are two types of intelligence --military and human.  Or as Groucho Marx said, "Military intelligence is acontradiction of terms."     You can get arrested for falsely wearing the real uniform of the armedforces.  That's why some tricksters don't wear an actual uniform but eitherbuild or rent a replica that surely looks real.  That way they are free to givespeeches, shout orders, make bogus policy pronouncements, hold pressconferences, use rank, and all sorts of other bits of theater from which theaverage citizen might infer that the actor really does represent the officialmilitary.  This sort of incorrect inference could cause all sorts ofpublic-relations and worse problems for the military establishment.  Could thisbe considered contributing to the delinquency of a major?     Although the Yippies are a generation or so forgotten, and at least asthis is written, our army is no longer a high-profile domestic villian, someonemay still want to pull one off for old times' sake.  A Jerry Rubin trick wouldbe to find a somewhat deserted area of a large public recreational park.  Placesome official-looking, commercially printed signs in prominent places.  Thesigns will say:                                    WARNING                          Army war dogs training in this                        area.  Very Dangerous.  Keep all                        children and pets within sight.                        If Army dog approaches do not                        move under any circumstances.                            --U.S. Army. Official--     Guess who will get blamed when frightened citizens complain to the town,city, county, state, feds, or whoever is in charge of the park.  Guess how manybrass hats will have to visit the site, investigate, write reports, and giveexplanations.     According to Captain DeGeorge Media, things got pretty bizarre over at thePentagon when the intelligence boys found that OPEC intelligence agents hadbroken the Pentagon ZIP code.  Hah!  Can you military agents reading this bookbreak the code I just used?  -- MESSAGE ENDS --     Speaking of military-intelligence agents, I recall that especiallyobnoxious recruits, second lieutenants, and other lower-order sorts could oftenbe sent on a fool's errand that often multiplied into more harassment than thestunt was really worth.  If your mark caught a first sergeant with anespecially bad hangover or an ill-tempered senior officer who'd just dicoveredthat his daughter was pregnant by some recruit from a Third World military unitattached for training -- well, you get the idea.  Anyhow, you can send thesemarks out to bring back a rubber flag to be flown on rainy days.  Or you cansend the idiot out to bring back the cannon report.  If you're air force, afive-gallon drum of prop wash is an appropriate errand target -- or a bucket ofprop pitch or a box of RPMs.  The navy is good for sending someone to getstuffing for the crow's nest, a biscuit gun for the galley, etc.  You canalways send someone to the post or ship's print shop for some dotted ink.  Atrip to the supply stores for plaid paint is fun.  The best part is that theyalmost always fall for such nonsense.  I think that says something about themilitary's effect on human thought processes.     If you have access to the sound system over which Reveille is played eachmorning, you might move up that magic time of day by, oh, say half an hour orforty-five minutes -- just enough to screw things up.  The next day, make itfifteen minutes late.  Another day, play it in the middle of the night.  Alwaysplay it a bit louder than usual.     In a similar sense, at one summer camp, a national guardsman switched theReveille record for a rock record one morning.  Another morning, recorded RustyWarren and her humor greeted the troops.     Some solid general advice for getting even within the military comes froma high-ranking and experienced military man who is now a biggie in the VFW.You know he's qualified to give advice.     He suggests, "The military is a blizzard of paper, paranoia, and intrigue.A dirty trickster who understands this and can parody the system will drive amark to ruin.  A good primer for action is to read CATCH 22.     "You will find an abundance of politics, ass kissing, back biting, gossip,and reputation hunting and destroying among career military people.  It's anabsolutely fertile ground to grow dirty tricks.  A nastily clever person willhave no trouble getting even for all the petty bullshit the military inflictsupon sensitive and logical people."     Thinking about sensitive and logical people brought Selective Service tomind.  When we last had a draft, during the Vietnam unpleasantness, all sortsof young men did all sorts of bizarre things to evade it.  However, a truedirty trickster would think in 180 degree terms -- why not invade the draft?Simply register yourself in about three dozen locations with an equal number ofdraft boards.  As far as I know, the law came down on only you if you failed toregister.  I guess I don't have to list the reasons why someone might wish toget even with the Selective Service system or a particular board.===============MOTION PICTURES===============     Hugh Troy was a famed artist who was also a hardcore practical joker.Once, the manager of a motion-picture theater offended Troy.  Troy went intothe same theater the next evening, after secreting several jars of huge mothson his person.  Soon after the feature began, he released the creatures, all ofwhich flew directly into the beam of the projector and stayed and stayed andstayed....     Have you ever sat down in a darkened theater, later finding your posteriorhas been parked on someone else's sticky candy bar or chewing gum from the lastshow?  Did you ever go to a movie house, feel you were ripped off by the poorfeature, get up and leave well before the film is finished, and still be unableto get a partial refund?     Peanuts Campbell used the restroom of a local movie house, and when heflushed the facility it backfired on him, staining his new pants and causingother patrons to both turn up their noses and turn away their eyes inannoyance.     Another person was served buttered popcorn in a tub that leaked the gooeyliquid all over his date's dress.  Management refused to pay any claims.  Thepatron of a stage theater had his pants torn on a potruding seat spring.  Nodamages were paid, and his attorney said the amount was too small to take tocourt.     What's next?  Peanuts Campbell has an answer.     You must have a quick, clear exit after this action.  Peanuts Campbellused to take a container of lukewarm vegetable soup into a movie theater.  Hesat in the front row of the balcony.  He made the sounds of being sick to hisstomach -- choking, coughing, retching -- then dumped the soup on the peoplebelow.  The same tactic also works at sporting events, public meetings --anywhere there is a crowd below you.  But you must have a good escape plan.     The point of all this is to have dozens of irate patrons demanding damagesettlements from the managements of the establishment.  If you don't feeladventuresome enough to dump on your fellow customers, simply go into thetheater early and, while no one else is around, place gooey chewing gum onrandom seats.  Pick seats aways form the aisle or ceiling safety lights.  Youmay also use a slow-drying glue on the seats.=============NEIGHBORHOODS=============     Be the first in your mark's neighborhood to become a blockbuster.  It'stime to fuss up the mark's neighbors again.  Find a real estate agency thatdeals mostly with blacks or Chicanos.  Posing as the mark, call the agency andinvite a salesperson out to talk about the sale of the mark's neighbor's house.Don't hoke up your role with a lot of brotherhood stuff -- play it straight.Now, if the mark is a good, solid white citizen living in a neighborhood ofsame-minded bigots, you have a wonderful deal going for you.  The kicker is,you give the salesman the mark's name and the neighbor's address.  Obviously,you must pick the most rednecked, bigoted neighbor to be the fall guy for theblack or Chicano salesperson.  By the time the "mistake" gets straightened outwho's going to believe the mark?  Not only have you alienated his neighbor, butyou have taken a big chunk out of his credibility and popularity.  Black isbeautiful, especially when it's the color of the mark's reputation among hispeers.     This stunt works -- a person I know used it.  He's a professional ballplayer who went into a furniture store with his wife to buy living-room-and-densuite of furniture.  The clerk was bigoted and exceptionally nasty.  My friendcalmly asked to see the manager, who turned out to be worse than the clerk.The black customer suddenly flashed his wallet full of green money, and bothwhite guys blanched.  No further words were exchanged as the married coupleleft the store.  Two days later my friend called a black real estate agency.You just read about what happened next.===========NOTARY SEAL===========     Possession of or access to a notary seal is vital to a trickster.  To theaverage layperson and common lawyer, the mere fact of a notary seal on adocument is like God's own rubber stamp.  Many times you will need to have adocument notarized as part of the scams explained in this book.  Having yourown seal kit is the obvious answer.  Some firms sell real ones -- "official" --on the black market.  Some sell replica kits, which are not official.  Avoidthese -- some are so crude that they wouldn't even fool a politician.  I knowone trickster who had a seal kit custom made -- by a con in a California prisonprint shop.  The con had been an engraver in civilian life and really knew hiswork.     You can buy a blank die kit openly from any shop stocking seals.Corporations use them all the time, which may give you a tip right there aboutthe value of seals.  You can have a custom seal made by many of thesecompanies.     However you obtain it, get a notary-seal kit.  The uses of it pay off thefirst few times you scam someone.  In addition to the notary seal, you shouldalso get a couple of other official-looking dies.  Commercially and openly, youcan obtain blank dies with state logos, or you can get one that looks like aU.S. eagle.  All sorts of possibilities exist.=============OIL COMPANIES=============     The soaring oil prices and lack of leadership got so bad late in 1979 thatall the dedicated and honest congresspersons got together to protest big oil.But who is afraid of seven people!     You remember the Great Gasoline Ripoff of 1979, when the oil companiesraped the driving public both coming and going?  Petroleum magnate JimmySlushslinger related this story:  A regular customer pulled up to a servicestation and said, "Fill 'er up."  As he was paying the bill, he said, "Ohgosh, all I have is a fifty-dollar bill.  Sorry."     The gas jockey replied, "No problem -- you can pay me the rest next week."     Starting rumors at the inappropriate time is the something else to do.For example, if your mark happens to be a gasoline station owned by a majorcompany, and a lot of citizens are in a gas line waiting for their semi-annualpittance of overpriced petroleum, you could walk onto the scene wearingoil-smeared coveralls and stroll down the line -- just out of sight of the realstation personnel.  Tell parked motorists that all fuel is gone.  If anyonegets belligerent, use the "I'm a minimum-wage employee, but the boss said ifanyone got angry to send the bastard to him, because he'll sure cool him off ina hurry."  Don't wait around for the cooling-off period.     Cut out a stencil that has the word ARAMCO on it, then spray it with whitepaint under the word STOP on all the stop signs in your town or near a largeoil-company office building or refinery.  Aramco, in case you didn't know, isthe major oil cartel that works with OPEC to rob American citizens.     During the 1979 oil-company blitzkrieg against the American public, aguerrilla fighter hit back.  He cut a sliding door in the floor of his van.  Hehad a three-hundred-gallon tank installed in the van, along with a smallelectrically operated pump and a twenty-foot hose.  He drove in only tocompany-owned gasoline stations, parked over the main tank caps, then used awrench to open one.  He dipped in his hose, turned on the quiet pump, andfilled his tank with three-hundred gallons of free tigers.     Bruno Tannetto dislikes oil companies.  For years he played credit-cardbingo with them, pirated cards, counterfeited cards, and ran up huge debts andskipped them -- all in the name of guerrilla warfare against the oil giants.He also saved all the postage-paid return envelopes they used to include withhis bills.  Since he rarely paid, he had quite a collection of envelopes,which is when he really got his rocks off.     Bruno collected a bunch of heavy rocks and boxed them up in a sturdycarton, which he marked, "Caution -- Geological-Core Samples" and addressed towhatever oil company he had the envelopes for.  Using the envelope as the"postage," he mailed this heavy box first class to the oil company, which hadto spring for the huge postal charges.  He did this many times to several ofthe giants.     Giggi Hilliard tells about a chap who played nasty to get an oil-companyoperation into some difficulty.  The agent provocateur's mode was forgery, andhere's what he did.  While on a routine visit to the oil company's corporateoffices, he swiped an internal memo from a desk while the secretary was out ofthe room.  He had his printer create some blank memo sheets using the companylogo.  Then, using a safe IBM typewriter and following the style of the companyoriginal, the trickster wrote a very sensitive memo from one oil-companymanager to another.  The memo discussed the need for deep cover to preventleakage of sensitive financial contributions to state and national politicalofficials.  He then leaked the memo to the press.     "The idea behind this," Hilliard explains, "is to cause the oil company,or whatever mark you choose, to have to explain and deny.  Nobody believes themanyhow, so you give that big business another credibility black eye.  Great,huh?  You can use this same tactic with any corporation, utility, or business.The list of sensitive topics is limitless.  But always use real officials'names on the forgeries."     Consult OVERTHROW (see section on Ma Bell) to obtain the telephone-credit-card numbers for the major oil companies.  Use this information to you bestadvantage.  Beware:  Oil companies hire experienced FBI, CIA, anddrug-enforcement people for their security staffs.  The security andintelligence operations of the oil industry are as nasty and effective asanything the feds could put together, and they are not hindered with what fewlaws do restrict the federal law-enforcement people.   You have no civil orhuman rights when the oil-company security and intelligence people go afteryou.  When dirty tricking the oil companies it is crucial that you practiceWYA, which means Watch Your Ass!     Recently, a lady trickster called the wife of an oil-company robber baronand pretended to be a lowly cleaning lady at corporate headquarters.  TellingMrs. Oil Executive that she, the cleaning lady, was a good Christian lady whobelieved in the God-given sanctity of family and marriage, our "cleaning lady"revealed that she often had to clean fresh semen stains from the couch in Mr.Executive's office after "private, after-hours conferences" between the bossand his young secretary.  That's all, just a simple telephone call from asimple, honest, God-fearing lady to a stay-at-home wife who's probably alreadyparanoid about her executive-husband's extracurricular sex life.  If moreright-minded citizens cared about the moral decline among executives in the oilindustry...     By now you surely owe that friendly and cooperative printer a few glassesof lemonade for being your co-cospirator in a number of scams.  Here's onemore.  Many of your area's prominent citizens should recieve a fancy invitationto attend a special local social function hosted by your favorite oilcorporation.  The invitation should read something like this:  "Admit bearerand guest for the special Hollywood entertainment and buffet on [day and date].Informal dress from [time] to [time] at [location]."     Try to pick a Saturday or Sunday and mail the invitation only a day or soprior to the nonevent.  This won't give the doubters, cynics, press, or anyoneelse much time to ascertain the veracity of the invitation.     In the summer of 1979, after reading newspaper stories about how the majoroil companies were raking in untaxed windfall profits ranging from 35 to 130percent, Melvin Lierd decided enough was enough.     "I had no mere dirty tricks in mind; my whole idea was to rip thosebastards as much as I could, the greedy, lying thieves," Melvin mutteredmildly.     His plan was simple.  He obtained credit cards from as many companies aspossible and charged as many products and services as possible only fromcompany-owned stations.     "I ran up bills as high and as fast as possible.  I had absolutely nointention of paying," Melvin explained.     Asked if he got the cards in his own name.  Melvin responded, "Nah, I gotthem in a fake company name.  I run up as much as I can, then pay them each $5or so, claiming it is only a token payment because we're a new company, but Iwill make the rest soon, blah, blah, blah.     "The greedy bastards are so anxious to make money they'll just add onthose outrageous interest charges -- usury rates, they are -- and drool at howmuch they're screwing me on financing.     "I'll string them along for a couple of months; then, if they get serious,I'll simply dissolve my company and let them eat their bills."     Do lawsuits bother Melvin?  He rates lawyers and judges slightly belowclam feces on his scale of respect, and he says, "Let them sue the company.  Ithas no assets.  Plus, they gotta find me.  Let me tell you something, old son-- you have to use the law.  There is no justice, so you use the law to suityourself.  How do you suppose the big oil companies and the big lawyers and thebig judges and all the other crooked snakes got so powerful -- by using thelaw!"     At last report, Melvin Lierd was draining the oil giants at a rate far inexcess of his own expectations.  He has invited many of you to join him.     Not content to live by the rule of "steal from them before they steal fromyou," Carl Bepp likes to add things to the oil-company stations' bulk tanks.He says that many of the additives described earlier in this book and elsewherewill work.  But, he does have a sentimental favorite.     "Once, some land rapists were drilling a noisy, sloppy gas well near thehome of a friend of mine," he relates.  "Since they were stealing from theland, I decided to steal some land from them.     "One evening, when they were finished drilling for the day, I got some ofthat slimy, mucky gunk that the drillers had bailed out of the well.  I took itto my most-hated oil company's very own station and dumped three two-gallonbuckets of that gunk down into their bulk tanks."     He said he has also used several gallons of refurbished solid wastes,known as sludge, as another additive for the oil-company products.==========PARTY TIME==========     It's always fun to drop into a number of what I call olde phart bars --the seedy downtown places where drunken men hang around from morning toevening, pouring down oceans of booze but never seeming to get falling-downdrunk.  The place stinks, and they stink.  It's a great place to make up aguest list for your mark's party.     Have a couple of beers and talk with the old duffers, unless everyone'suptight about a stranger being there.  Usually, though, old pharts in bars arefriendly.  After a bit of social ice has been clinked, tell them about a kegparty "you're" having.  Obviously, you use the mark's name and give hisaddress.  Early Sunday afternoon is a good time to schedule the party.     If you hit enough bars on Saturday and talk to enough old drunks, yourmark should have a helluva wingding show up at his house Sunday afternoon, allhung over and roaring to get started again.  Salud!     Remember Donald Segretti, Richard Nixon's unofficial classless clown?Apparently, he could have easily written this book from memory.  In any case,Segretti came up with a party "on behalf of" the late Hubert Humphrey, thoughtto be a threat to Nixon back in 1972.  Segretti printed up thousands ofinvitations to a luncheon with Humphrey, set for 1 April in Milwaukee.  He hadthe invitations distributed all over the black ghettos of that city.     They read, "FREE! -- All you can eat -- lunch with beer, wine or soda.With Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Lorne Greene, Mrs. Martin Luther King."  Hegave a time and place, too.  Of course, there was no lunch, no drinks, and nopeople there other than hundreds of hungry, thirsty, and highly irritatedpeople.  Should we say they were non-Humphrey voters?     The next stunt demands that you or your personal agent arrive at a partythrown by the mark.  Among your mark's other munchie dishes you should includea selection of candied laxatives.  You can serve a commercial product, which isalready adequately disguised as candy, or you can make your own by coatingand/or coloring stronger constipation-relief medicines.  Be creative with thedisguise.  The result of having people eat mittfuls of these bowel busters isbreathtaking.     Woolsey Newcomer and Enos Pomerene remember a party a number of years backin which a barrel of beer washed down the thirst of the folks gobbling boguscandy, which was really a powerful laxative.     "The digestive hell began the morning after the party and lasted up tofour days for some people," Woolsey recalled.  "The guys had been stuffingthose laxatives in their mouths and washing it all down with some draft beer.What a combination!  We had some sick folks."     Woolsey always wondered who had infiltrated the candy dish.     A more subtle relation to the dish full of laxatives is to get a candymold from a confectionery-supply house.  These are usually in the form oflittle animals, Santas, etc.  Molds for chocolate Easter bunnies are probablythe most common example.  You simply melt a little bit of real chocolate and agood bit of chocolate laxative together, fill the mold, and turn out somehomemade candy with an explosive punch to it.     Finally, if you know your mark is having a party any given day or night,that would be a splendid time to cause the utilities to be shut off orotherwise disrupted.  Contemporary civilized socializers just can't handledisruption of modern conveniences like power and water, and they tend toremember the host/hostess (your mark) and identify him/her with the failure.It's a good, subtle, nasty trick.========PEN PALS========     Men are fools when it comes to being conned by the game that proceded evenprostitution.  For example, if you could create a fictional lady, she could beas seductive as you wanted her to be.  After all, to the mark she is an imagebrought on by the words you put down on paper or maybe use on the telephone.You want him to become her pen pal.     As this scam progresses, you hope the emphasis will turn to personalmatters.  It's even more fun if the mark is married, because then he'll make abigger ass of himself.  Your fictional pen-pal lady must build a desire in themark, by doing just what comes so naturally.     The climax is an assignation setup in an exotic city as far away asreality will allow.  Setting up this sting calls for teasing creativity and allsorts of facades like flowers, hints of gifts, Fredrick's of Hollywood apparel,bogus sexy Polaroids, etc.     The next to last thing you will do in this stunt is discontinue yourpost-office box or whatever mail-drop address you were using for his returnmessages.  The last thing you will do is mail, call, or telegraph this finalmessage, "Meet you at the Sin City Hotel, suite 625, tonight at 10 P.M.  I'llhave the tub and me all warm and wet."     Naturally, only one of you will arrive, and he'll hardly be in the mood tostart without "you."========PERSONAL========     You can easily turn your mark into a fabled thief, according to formerprivate detective Trowridge Bannister.  You need a full-face photo of yourmark, plus a furtive longer shot of the type usually taken by surveillancecameras.  Take these pictures and your WARNING copy to a trusted printer to getsome posters made.     Bannister explains:  "You make up posters warning mechants and customersto be on the lookout for the mark.  Display his name and picture on the posterin a prominent location, along with the big headlines about this person's beinga thief, shoplifter, or pickpocket.  A small amount of copy could explain somebrief history of your mark's criminal career.  Make it sound realistic -- don'tget cute.  Sign the thing by the local community's merchants association orsomething like that."     Bannister says the final step is for you to take these posters to variousstores and carefully post them around the stores.  Avoid being seen.  Doingthis in a large shopping mall or in a busy downtown area ensures tha thousandsof local citizens will get your message about the mark.     You could use the same tactic and mark your mark as a sex offender, childmolestor, or worse...a pornographer.     You can write horrible "news" stories about your mark and have yourprinter set them in newspaper style, complete with column-length lines and,perhaps, border rules and datelines.  You should make the dateline a town inwhich your mark fomerly lived.  In these bogus news stories, she/he could bethe subject of almost any sort of exercrable activity, such as child molesting,sexual perversion, child abuse, killing kittens, starving and beating puppies,poaching fawns, self abuse in public, and on and on.     Naturally, the more authentic you make the story, the better the scam willgo when you send Xerox copies to the mark's employer, family, and friends.Have your mail postmarked from the mark's former city and include a short notefrom "a friend who thinks you ought to know the truth."     During World War II, the British SOE made use of a harassing substancethat became known as "Who, Me?"  It was later adopted by the American OSS.Essentially, it was a tube of obnoxious-smelling liquid that would be squirtedonto an enemy's clothing or body during some time that would not cause alarm,such as while she or he was sleeping or bathing, or during the jostling of acrowd.  Exposed to the air, the liquid immediately gave off the pungent odor ofstrong, fresh human feces.     The product was manufactured by Federal Laboratories near Pittsburgh underan OSS contract.  It proved to be quite satisfactory and, as it was packaged, auser could eject one cubic centimeter of Who, Me? as a thin liquid stream atdistances of up to ten feet.  There was little danger of self contamination ifit was handled properly.     According to OSS records, two different formulas were used -- a fecal odorfor the European theater and a "skunky/body" odor for the Pacific theater.  Theresearch-backed reasoning is that because the Japanese often used human wastesas agricultural fertilizers, they would not be as sensitive to the odor as theGermans.  Both forms were found to be "noticeably lasting for well over a day,despite frequent washings."     You probably want to know if you can buy surplus Who, Me? from your localarmy-navy outlet.  No, but you can produce it yourself using the followingformula:     919 g. mineral white oil      20 g. skatol      20 g. n-butyric acid      20 g. n-valeric acid      20 g. n-caproic acid       1 g. amyl mercaptan     That will produce a kilogram of the fecal-smelling liquid.  You couldalter the amounts to produce as much or as little as you think you'll need.  Ifyou prefer the skunky odor, here's the formula on a relative-percentage basis:     65 percent mineral white oil     10 percent butyric acid     10 percent mercaptan     15 percent alpha ionone     Another great pretender to aroma of woodpussy is 3-methyl-1-butane-thiol.It is easily obtainable in chemical-supply stores and smells almost as terribleas the real thing.     If you are assertive enough to get the chemicals and mix up of a batch ofcomposition, you probably already have the applicator selected and don't needfurther help.  If not, use this as a lesson in becoming more self-sufficient.Happy squirting.     If you're too insecure to become a home chemist, you could obtain someformaldehyde, which is popularly known as embalming fluid.  This stuff is badnews.  It stinks and cna burn your skin.  According to some folks, if enough ofit gets into the air it will vaporize.  If this takes place in a room, thatroom will be cleared of all breathing objects for several hours.     Being a liquid, formaldehyde may be squirted from any appropriateapplicator.  It is fairly devastating stuff, but you can get it in smallamounts if you are involved in biological or chemical experiments.  Sometimes,a white lab coat makes a good cover when you go shopping in a drugstore ormedical-supply house outside your neighborhood or town.     A bit more personal, but nowhere near as dangerous, is to dip your fingersin warm water, come up behind you mark, and as you deliver an ear-shatteringsneeze, fling the water on the mark's neck or back.  This works well withbackless dresses, at the pool, or almost anywhere, for that matter.  Escape maybe a vital concern here, depending on your mark's sense of humor.     If your mark is one or both members of a young couple, Dana Bearpaw had apolicy of calling the parents of one or both.  Playing the role of an older,irate neighbor, he would shout, "Look, I don't care how much [description ofcarnal activity to be left up to the discretion of the caller] yourson/daughter engages in with every male/female/whatever every damn night.  Justkeep them out of our backyard when they're doing it.  If you're any kind of aparent you'll talk to them about all this."     Parents usually take this sort of thing to heart...which causes all sortsof communications and credibility problems with their youngsters.     If you want to endear your mark to his/her neighbors, go to the locallibrary and consult the street-address or cross-reference city directory tolearn who your mark's neighbors are and their phone numbers.  If you can't findsuch a directory in a more rural area, just drive and list names frommailboxes.     Later, call some selected neighbors using your mark's name and be sure youidentify yourself as a close neighbor.  Then, launch into something like, "Iwant to come over and talk to you about [Communism, homosexuality, childpornography, drug legalization, busing, whatever].  I want you to sign apetition demanding fair treatment under the law for [whatever topic you'vechosen]."     Be pushy and really work to make your mark's reputation a deserved one.     Many times women are certain their men are out somewhere addingsignificantly to the statistical rate for sexual infidelity.  When one lady hadabsolute proof of her man's bombastic bedding habits with other ladies, shedevised a scheme that would guarantee his sticking around.  On one rare nightwhen he was in their bed, his mate waited until he had fallen into his usualdeep sleep, then gently applied one of the new superglue products to both hispenis and his leg and held the two together for the short bonding time so welladvertised on television.     No elephant, tractor, or pro footballer could break that bond.  It tookthe delicate skill of the family physician to make the separation, a movematched that afternoon by the vendicted lady, who also cut out on her very soreex-man.===========PHOTOGRAPHY===========     Ask any competent photographer who also has some sense of humor, aboutcomposite photographs.  They're easy to make -- the tabloids used them foryears.  It's a photo where someone has been added to a group, someone's facehas been used on the body of another person, or an entirely new photograph iscreated simply by using composite parts.     This is a very useful dirty trick and one that bears the stamp of approvalof the CIA and the FBI.     Unless you're competent in photography, including copying, darkroomtechnique, and minor retouching and airbrushing, or unless you have a verytrusted friend who will help you, you'd best forget this one.  However, donewell, the uses of composites are limited only by your imagination.  Here aresome examples passed along by some of the sources of this book:o     A "photo" showing the mark leaving a motel room with a person of the      opposite sex.o     A "photo" sent anonymously to the police showing the mark or the mark's      vehicle engaged in some illegal activity -- like poaching, dealing drugs,      or corrupting the morals of minors.  Be sure the license number of the      vehicle of visible.o     A "photo" showing the mark's spouse nude and in a compromising pose with      a companion -- human, animal, or whatever.o     A "photo" showing the mark in a compromising situation with a person of      the same sex could be sent to the mark's employer.  This will surely mark      your mark a gay who will live in infamy.     Like other topical areas in this book, this one is strictly a technicalsuggestion.  You will have to furnish the motive, rationale, and applicationfor your own photographic nastiness.========POLITICS========     As public jesters from Jerry Rubin to Jerry Ford to Hunter Thompson toFrank Rizzo to Nobody have discovered, any fool with twenty-five dollars andtwenty-five signatures can run for public office.  As Rubin asks, "What betterway to make fun of the political system than to run for public office?"     He's right.  It gives you a legal platform to attack and ridicule theinstitutions and people who deserve such attention.  If you have eithersophisticated or totally rustic local media, and know how to manage andmanipulate media people, you will get oodles of free publicity.  That isn'tvery difficult, as many people demonstrate daily.     Neil Mothra, who understands politicians, came up with this stunt.  Ifyour mark is a candidate or political VIP, if his coterie doesn't know you, andif it's a very hot, shirtsleeve day, you're all set.  Slip into the meeting orreception area, walk briskly up to the mark, and offer politely, "May I takeyour coat, sir?"  The impression is that you are going to hang it up for him.It will be best if you are dressed up or in some form of institutional-lookinguniform.  You simply take the coat away with you.  If you also have theperson's wallet, you must do what you think is best and most honest to allconcerned.     One of the grandest tricks of all time happened in 1960, when a beamingcrook named Richard Nixon was posing in San Francisco's Chinatown with a groupof Chinese youngsters holding a large banner spelling out a slogan in nativecharacters.  The photo ran locally and was picked up by both wire services andnetwork television and disseminated to the entire nation.     The very next day, a worried staffer told canidate Nixon the Chinesebanner had said, "What about the Hughes Loan?"  It was a reference to theHoward Hughes cash payoff to Nixon's brother Donald, in the form of a "loan."At the same time, Nixon found out that thousands of fortune cookies had beenpassed out at the same rally, each containing the same message, this time inEnglish:  "Ask him about the Hughes Loan."     The antics of Donald Segretti, court jester to the Committee to ReElectthe President (CREEP) in 1972, should fill your imagination with enoughfertilizer to devise tactics of your own, should you wish to advise a politicalcandidate.     For example, during the Florida primary, one of Segretti's raiders paid ayoung lady twenty dollars to streak naked outside Ed Muskie's hotel room,shouting, "I love Ed Muskie!" and "Father my child, Ed!"  During a Muskiepicnic, a Segretti trooper had a chemist mix up a batch of butyl percaptan,which is, as you know, a grossly foul, stinking mess.  The after-action reportto Segretti noted that among the guests, "everybody thought the food was bad."     If the bigshot candidate is having one of those hundred-dollar-a-platefundraisers, your candidate should hold a ninety-nine-cent, blue-collar special-- chipped-ham or bologna-and-cheese sandwiches.  Blue paper plates and cupswould contrast nicely with the power establishment's fancy eatery.  The themecould be "Why pay a hundred dollars for bologna from [other candidate]?"     Here's some further nastiness at the expense of three marks -- apolitician, the Postal Service, and the citizen you've chosen.  You secure afranked postal envelope from your political mark.  Carefully steam and removethe original mailing-address label.  Using a rented or public IBM electrictypewriter, carefully type in the name of your citizen mark on an IBM addresslabel.  Stick this label on the envelope.     The rest of this stunt depends on how nasty you are and how much revengeyou feel you must squeeze from the mark(s).  Some general suggestions for thecontents of this envelope include:  Heavily anti-Semitic propaganda for aJewish mark; fanatical antireligious material for a religious sort; veryexplicit pornography for a very straight person; homemade Polaroid photosfeaturing closeups of dead pet animals -- roadkills and mutilations -- forsensitive animal lovers; Polaroid closeups of genitalia, both human and animal,for very proper people; and on and on.     Most marks will blame all this on the person whose return address is onthe envelope -- the political candidate.     Congressmen (there are rarely Congresswomen) have postal frankingprivileges that allow them a lot of free mail.  A longtime politician baiter,Ted Shoemaker, decided to help a least-favored Congressman.  Obtaining afranked envelope from his own mailbox, Shoemaker had a printer duplicate thepostage-free envelope.  By the way, this is a serious federal crime.  He alsoprepared a mailing in which the ultraconservative congressman announced hisbacking for abortion and legalized marijuana, saying, "Times have changed, andwe old farts have to change with them."  Further, the letter had the politiciansaying, "You get drunk on booze -- why not let the kids get high on pot?  Youcheat on your spouse -- why not let the kids get a little free fun too?"     As you might imagine, the constituency was terminal Bible Belt.  Shoemakeraddressed, stuffed, and mailed a thousand of these messages, including copiesto many media outlets.  It only took two days for the old pol to claim fraud,but by that time the bogus letter had received lots of media attention, andmore than a few old voters had made up their minds their good old boy wasactually guilty of the whole thing anyway.     Shoemaker says, "He may have gotten some sympathetic backlash, though.This kind of thing can backfire, so be careful."     Barclay Skinner, the activist who championed women for membership in theNational Jaycees, developed a frothing dislike for an especially weasel-likepolitical candidate.  This man's major credentials were that he'd served as alegal advisor for the Warren Commission, which tells you a lot about his lackof honor, intelligence, and integrity.     Skinner hired an actor who was a real lookalike for this politician andhad the ringer travel the state giving speeches and press conferences in thereal politician's name.  The actor made all sorts of oddball, controversial,and asinine statements.  He insulted local leaders, heroes, and institutions.He came off as a real sphincter.     Because the real politician was not really well-known either personally orvisually, the impersonation worked well for the planned week.  The realcandidate found out about this and tried to stop it, but he was a week toolate.  He did not do well on election day.  By that time, Skinner and his actorfriend had faded back into the shrouded mists of heroic anonymity.     "Ah, politicians, God's unchosen people!" Skinner beamed.===========PORNOGRAPHY===========     Buy some really sleazy skin magazines -- ones featuring kiddie porn,animals, etc.  Use an IBM typewriter and some pressure-sensitive mailing labelsto prepare phony address labels in your mark's name.  Place them on the pornomagazines.  You can start by leaving a few magazines in doctors' or dentists'waiting rooms, Sunday-school reading rooms, and the periodical shelves of yourlocal library.  The public will think your mark is passing along his usedliterature.     You might also get some paste-over copyright stickers printed with yourmark's name and address.  Buy some raunchy porno, put the stickers in somewhereon the title area, then take the goods to local grade school and junior highschool areas and sell them to the children.  Do this only once.  If you do getcaught, swear the mark paid you to distribute his pornography.     This tactic is best used against bluenose censors and others who wouldimpose their own personal beliefs upon you under penalty of law.  According tocivil libertarian Townsend McFerrick, this piece of counter-propaganda isalmost always effective against the personal outrages of puritanical dictators.==============POSTAL SERVICE==============     M.J. Banks once sent her mother a Bible via the U.S. Postal Service.  Bythe time it arrived, seven of the Ten Commandments were broken.     If you like your mail deliverer but dislike the U.S. Postal Service, LorenEugene Sturgis has good news for you.  He feels that ordinary citizens arealready subsidizing the big corporations and their junk-mail advertising.  Hefights junk mail, which we'll get to in a moment.  But, here is one of Loren'sways of cutting down on your own personal postal overhead.     Use Elmer's glue to coat the surfaces of stamps.  This substance defeatsthe cancellation imprint enough that when you soak the stamp in lukewark water,both the Elmer's and the cancellation ink come right off.  Then you reglue theback of the stamp and use it again and again and again.  This is a realmoney-saver for those who use a lot of postage, Loren points out.  Your localpostmaster would also point out how illegal this stunt is.  Whom would yourather believe?     Rufus and Ruthie Luv are true rebels.  Ruf used to work for the postalservice, and he claims that automatic sorting machines really can't tell stampdenominations.  For example, he said letters do go through with Easter Seals inplace of stamps.  He also suggests placing your stamp in the lower rightcorner.  That way, the automatic canceling device will miss it and someone canreuse the stamp.     The U.S. Postal Service also furnishes you with games you can play withyour mark.  If you've ever moved, you know how happy USPS is to give youchange-of-address cards.  OK, you get such card and change your mark's address.It would be good if you had his mail sent to another state.  Don't get exotic,though; keep it simple.  Use a larger city, like Los Angeles, since thisincreases the likelihood of further screw-ups as the mark attempts tostraighten out the mess when he discovers his mail is no longer arriving.  Youcan double the trouble by changing both home and business addresses.  Stop afew moments and think how fouled up your own life would be if your mail wassuddenly diverted and possibly lost.  It's just a thought....================THE POWER CARTEL================     When Metropolitan Edison had to raise money shortly after beingembarrassed by its nuclear tinker toy at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, thepremier psychic semiologist Doctor John McManmon joked that they offered tosell used matches as an alternative power source.     In a far more deadly vein, Eddie Gast doesn't regard the giant utilitycompanies as public services.  He sees them as powerful monopilies who buylegislators, judges, and commission officials as human investments towardlarger profits for the big stockholers.     "They don't deserve mere dirty tricks," says Gast.  "Out-and-out sabotageis all they understand.  The ecotage raiders had the answers -- cut power linesand blow up towers."     Gast also advocates shooting insulators, trashing vehicles and otherpower-company equipment, and terrorizing their service workers.     "I also show people how to doctor their home meters to cut way back on theamount of money paid for electricty.  Anyone can learn how -- a guy even has abook out on it [John Williams, STOPPING POWER METERS, available fromLoompanics].  Do unto them before they do unto you, I say."     Asked if this doesn't inconvenience and even hurt innocent people, Gastsays it does, but they must learn who the enemy really is.     Other tricksters are less radical.  Osborn Milteer suggests that most ofthe tricks pulled on the telephone and oil companies will work as well on thepower giants.     "Leave the small rural co-ops alone, though," says Milteer.     Surprisingly, Gast agrees, adding, "The rural co-ops are the way thingsshould work.  The people really do own them.  I want to destroy the mammothcorporations -- the monopolies who own nuclear plants and oil companies and actas if they own our government, too."     For example, J.W. Burke, Jr., writes from Virginia to explain the monopolybetween the State Corporation Commission and the VEPCO (the Virginia PowerCompany).  He explains that in the middle of May 1979 VEPCO filed for a rateincrease of nine million dollars citing financial losses caused by thetemporary shutdown of two nuclear units by the federal government.  They hadalready just had a huge increase in March.  Without a whimper, the Virginia"regulatory" agency gave in.     According to Burke, that's not the end.  Less than a week after gettingthe nine million, the VEPCO powers came around asking for an additional ninemillion.     A mite upset, Burke exploded, "They [VEPCO] don't give a shit about publicrelations, and they don't need to, because the newspapers here won't evensqueak about this.  VEPCO also has the State Corporation Commission in theirpocket.     "It's worth noting that the SCC has never turned down a VEPCOrate-increase request.  We have a lot of getting even to do here in the OldDominion."     The power cartel is as vunerable to the same getting-even tricks as aredeserving institutions and persons mentioned in other sections of this book.=======PRINTER=======     You've noticed that a friendly, trustworthy, and perhaps devious printerhas been your staunch associate in so many tricks.  A printer can be your bestfriend, and having access to one or more totally trusted printers is anabsolute must for a trickster.  There is an old axiom about the printingbusiness that goes, "We don't read the writing; we just set the type."  Don'ttrust it.  Instead, trust a friendly printer you know.  Often it is easy tofind a printer who thinks as you do.  If not, your best bet is among largeprintshops in other cities.  Although this is risky, many really don't censoryour jobs.  But you're better off to cultivate your own good offset printer.     Unless your printer is also a good graphic artist, don't rely on him orher for such services as double printing, counterfeiting official documents,retouching, or sophisticated design work.  That works calls for a person whohas the specific skills and knowledge to handle it.  I might add that thoseskills are not all that tough to pick up.  Speaking from experience, a solidbackground in advertising and publications work will give you the specificknowledge and skills.=========RAILROADS=========     If a railroad line has been nasty to you and you want to get back, you arewelcome to follow "Bart's" advice.  A fan of Edward Abbey, "Bart" offers youthe following from his trickster's arsenal.  Set the manual brakes on railroadcars; this will cause a great deal of delay in checking and rechecking, whichties up people, time, and money.  You can visit the railyard areas on cold,cold nights in winter and pour lots of water on the switch points.  Thisfreezes the switches, making them inoperable.====RATS====     Here's one where the price just has to be about right.  You invest a fewdollars in some Norwegian rats -- the big, dirty, mean ones.  The idea is toget males and females.  Put them in some well-screened rabbit hutches.  Feedthem on garbage and swampweeds.  These rodents are cheap to keep, and theymultiply quickly, and they make people really unhappy.  Ask a New Yorker aboutthe Rat Raids of summer 1979!  I am sure the imaginations of many readers havealready figured out creative things to do with all those rats.  Good oldWillard, revisited!========RELIGION========     If your mark is a religious sort, you could follow the advice of Lee H.Blakely, who suggests printing up phony leterheads using your mark's name,address, and telephone number under the imprinteur of a group such as Atheistsfor a Stronger America or Nonbelievers Against God or Gays Against God.     Blakely continues, "You then mail really bitchy letters to local TVstations demanding equal time to make up for 'Sunrise Sermonette.'  You alsowrite letters to local newspapers.  Sometimes, smaller newspapers don't verifyletters that come in on letterheads and are typed well."     From one of my regular religious correspondents, the Reverend FleisherMcGeary, I learned that hooligans have been carrying on near his parish inPacker, Alabama.  It seems their trick is to call or visit one of the localwhacko religious sects -- the goofier and more Holy Roller the better -- andask them to come meditate with "you" and your family.  Of course, you give themthe name and address of your mark.  Another variant is to suggest that the holyfolks roll in during the mark's office hours and save the staff.  Getting thefix set up here requires a great acting job, lots of sincerely pious rhetoric,and all that glop.  But according to McGeary, it works.     If the mark is not well-known in his/her neighborhood, you can call, usingthe mark's name, and say you would like to come talk with the neighbor aboutcommunism, gay rights, gun control, interracial sex relations, or free drugs.The idea here is to be as obnoxious as possible about the issues.  Say thatyour mark represents his/her local church.     If the mark is a Grand Liberal, you can use the same tactic, but turn thetopics around -- support for the death penalty for most any crime, even tougherantidrug laws, outlawing abortion, and making the ERA illegal.===========RESTAURANTS===========     It used to be annoying when a waitess accidentally stuck her thumb in yoursoup while serving you lunch.  That was before topless waitresses, however.     Suppose you're really fried with a local eatery for charging you forterrible food time after time, and are ready to wash your hands of the wholeplace.  Try silver nitrate instead.  If you can introduce a bit of thatchemical into the soap dispenser in the restaurant washroom, you will havecustomers and employees furious with the restaurant.  Silver nitrate will leavetheir hands and faces unwashably stained to an ugly, erratic brown color.  Itdoes not come off easily.     Harry Katz, a prominent Pennsylvania socialite, frequents many posh diningestablishments in the company of equally ritzy jet setters.  He insists thatthis scam is only a practical joke, which may be correct.  However, with a bitof malice aforethought, someone could easily create a nasty version.  Harrycarries with him a supply of elegantly printed cards.  He spots someone hewishes to hassle and bribes a waiter to carry one of the cards over to themark.  The card reads, "The management requests that you and your party leaveimmediately before we have to call the authorities."     Of course, we don't always have to be so sophisticated.  If there areentire groups of people you don't like, you can always eat in restaurantsfrequented by such people and put salt into the sugar dispensers or unscrew thetops of the salt and pepper shakers, so that the next diner gets a plate fullof seasoning.  Of course, such stunts are perilously close to April Foolamateurism, but they do have some minor harassment value.     If you had a friend who would take care of the tab, you'd take that friendout to dinner, right?  In some swanky and excellent eatery, order your finestrepast.  Treat yourself to the best.  About halfway through your meal, youintroduce that friend who's going to take care of your tab.  Your friend is adead cockroach that you brought in with you, carried carefully in your jacketpocket.  Place your late friend amid some food on your plate and then turn onyour theatrics.  Make a noisy fuss and express concern about your health andthe restaurant's cleanliness standards, and mutter about your lawyer filing anaction.  After this, let the management talk you into a free meal or two andsome drinks.     This next trick will cost a few bucks, but if you consider it as aperverted investment, the return will be worth many times the outlay.  Forexample, a small display ad could be run in either a campus newspaper or one ofthe small local newspapers or shoppers.  Pick one that isn't too professional,since they are less likely to check the veracity of the ad.     The ad promises some fantastic dinner bargain, such as a steak dinner fortwo at half price, when the clipped ad is presented between 6 and 7 o' clockthat night.  Or promise an All You Can Eat Special of roast steamship round ofbeef for three dollars, with all the trimmings, also with the clippped ad.  Usethe logo of the restaurant with which you are feuding in the ad.  Check theirregular ads so your layout looks authentic.  Take it in and tell them you'rethe new assistant who handles advertising.  Just don't spend too much timetalking or getting remembered.  Be prepared to pay cash if necessary.     Between 6 and 7 P.M. your mark will literally have his restaurant crammedwith very hungry and soon-to-be-very-unhappy customers.  By 8 P.M. the ownercould have a whole lot of ex-customers and an undeserved bad reputation thatwill be hard to oevercome.  Or the owner may decide to go along with the"promise," which will cost her/him a lot of bucks.  Finally, there will be anunpleasant scene with the newspaper.  This scam will also work with local radiostations.     Note, too, that this scam can be turned so that the mark is the newspaperor radio station.================RICHARD M. NIXON================     Richard Nixon has all the charm and warmth of an obscene Christmas card.Let's remember him always.  For instance, whenever you are asked for yourSocial Security number for no good purpose to you, and when giving a false onewill not harm you, give them Richard Nixon's number.  It's the least we can dofor all that he did to us.  Richard M. Nixon's Social Security number is567-68-0515.=============RUBBER STAMPS=============     A stock of "official" rubber stamps is an important part of documentingauthentication.  A good sampling of what you need and what is available may befound in THE NEW PAPER TRIP, a valuable reference book for the dirty trickster.Most office-supply stores and many mail-order outfits sell just about anyrubber stamp you need.  You will need rubber stamps.========SECURITY========     Mort Sahl once pointed out that people who were afraid of ideas andthinking would label him an outlaw.  Yet, Sahl, who has a hell of a lot moreunderstanding and conscience than many people have brains, says he thinks ofhimself as a moral sheriff.  I think we can tie into that.     Any person concerned with security needs a supply of chains, locks,cables, and glues.  Sometimes you need to protect your mark.  That might meanchaining his/her car to the bumper of another car at a party, in a parking lot,or on the street.  A good padlock completes the picture, and by the time youget some expert there to release things, everyone is unhappy.  If your mark isthe obvious target, then all the victims are unhappy with him/her, too.     Locks, chains, and cables are great for closing lanes and driveways,sealing vehicles in or out.  They can keep people in offices, homes,apartments, or even buildings.  They can fasten objects to other objects.  Thehorizon of your own ideas is not yet even in sight.===========SLEEPY TIME===========     If you want your mark to sleep for a bit you should know that the fabledMickey Finn, knockout drops of grade-B-film fame, is a very real item that youcan incorporate into your dirty tricks.  The mysterious liquid is simplychloral hydrate.  Although it is no longer in general use as a sedative, it isstill available.  In addition, you can easily find the formula to produce yourown version.  It's a bitter substance, so mix one gram with several dissolvedsaccharine tablets before serving.  Most experts also suggest that you use thechloral hydrate in connection with booze -- a very potent combination.     Another sleepy-time mixture is one capsule of Seconal mixed in with themarks beer.  But as Doctor Christopher Garwood Doyle cautions, use only onecapsule and never use this drug with someone who is really loaded or otherwisemedically messed up.  Seconal is a powerful downer and can be deadly.     Other than that, according to Doyle, you take one capsule of Seconal, thehundred-milligram size, and empty it into a glass of beer.  Stir gently andserve to the mark.  Sleep will take him away in about fifteen minutes.     Sweet dreams.==========SLINGSHOTS==========     Slingshots are useful tools for the dirty trickster.  The modern ones areas different from the forked-limb-and-inner-tube variety of your youth as aDaisy BB gun is from a Taser.  They aren't even called slingshots any more.The technocrats have renamed them hand catapults.  I bet Goliath is turningover in his grave.     Any good sporting-goods store can outfit you with the propernylon-and-steel Hand Catapult to carry on your missions.  If you'd prefer todeal through the mail, write to Wham-O, Box 4, San Gabriel, California 91778.If you want a giant assault model, there's one available, according to Mike Hoyof Loompanics.  Mike reports that an outfit known as Information Unlimited,Milford, New Hampshire 03055, sells plans for a "giant slingshot," which isfive feet tall and anchored into the ground.     I recall some of the boys in my old neighborhood using an improvisedversion of the giant slingshot to propel large fruits and vegetables againstthe home of the neighborhood grouch.  They used the fork of a walnut tree andan entire inner tube.  A winch drew back the pouch, which could load severalcantaloupes, pieces of watermelon, a half dozen tomatoes, or combinations ofthe above.  Effective hits were scored at about 75 yards, as I recall.  Perhapsthis technique could be put to modern use by means of a mobile weapon.========STICKERS========     John Hansen of Boulder, Colorado, takes a more passive but no lesscreative approach in his revenge.     "Vexed by poor service in restaurants, vending machines, and other devicesor institutions that take your money and don't deliver the promised services?"Hansen asks.  His response is called Creative Revenge.     He has had permastick slogans printed to slap on an offender's premises orequipment.  For example, if a vending machine fails to deliver, Hansen slaps itwith a sticker reading, THIS MACHINE STEALS MONEY.  For restaurants, Hansen hasstickers that read, HORRIBLE FOOD, or LOUSY SERVICE.  The stickers can beplaced on the table or counter, or on the windows and doors of theestablishment.     His other stickers include THIS MOVIE RATED BLAH for questionablecinematic efforts, MY TAXES PAID FOR THIS? to be placed on examples ofgovernment or public foolishness, FILTHY RESTROOMS, for either food-service orgasoline stations, and INEPT NERD for offending civil servants or irritatingstore clerks.     For the simpleminded who park supidly in one or more spaces, Hansen tagstheir vehicles with WAY TO PARK, ACE.  He has a bunch of NO MORE JUNK MAIL --RETURN TO SENDER stickers to affix to people's mailboxes.  Enraged by the oilcompanies, John Hansen printed a new sticker for the first time in mid-1979 --PRICE GOUGER -- which adorns hundreds of service-station gasoline pumps.  Inmany cases, equally irritated station owners are not removing the stickers.     Hansen has a huge variety of stickers, including examples such as RIPOFF;PAID UNDER PROTEST; YES I MIND, DON'T SMOKE; RUDE DRIVER; GAS HOG; and anentire selection of adult stickers that feature hilariously nasty slogans whoseR rating places them out of Family Hour.  I have used Hansen's stickers, andthey are wonderful.

He has a favoritegame he plays with them, using a least favorite acquaintance as an unwittingaccomplice.  Ossie explains his game.     "I go to the bulletin board of a store out of my neighborhood and removea policy notice from the bulletin board, since the statement is usually printedon corporate letterhead.  At home, I cut off the letterhead and with rubbercement, dummy up a blank piece of paper under it to create a new blank piece ofletterhead.  I take this to a self-operated coin photocopy machine and get afew good copies that are as clean as the original with no smears or linesshowing.     "I call the corporation and learn who a couple of the vice-presidents areby name.  Then I type, very carefully and professionally, using a rentalelectric typewriter at the local library, a very nice letter to several of myleast favorite acquaintances.  I tell each of them they have won some fabulousprize at their neighborhood store...like a small color TV set or two hundreddollars' worth of free groceries, something like that.  I tell them they shouldcome in Saturday and claim their prize.  I sign the VP's name and mail thebogus letter.     "They show up, and the local store manager is puzzled.  He doesn't knowwhat to do.  It's Saturday, and he can't call the corporate headquarters.  Whatdoes he tell the customers?  Will they get upset with him?  With the store?What do you think happens Monday?  And beyond?"     Happy Shopping, Oswald Rankin.     If you're upset by a large corporation that owns a dairy, here's an oldtrick milk truck drivers used to pull on each other a few years back, beforethe mammoth agricorporations destroyed competition.  The driver for, say, theUdderly Sweet Dairy used a medical syringe to inject a few squirts of lemonconcentrate into the milk containers of the Joyful Jugs Dairy.  The customerwho bought Joyful Jugs milk would find the product sour as soon as she/heopened the container and would storm back to the supermarket to sour theircorporate milk.  It doesn't take too many stormy customers for a supermarket todump all over a dairy.     Today, of course, medical syringes are only a bit tougher to obtain, lemonconcentrate is easily available, and delivery men don't do this to each otherany more because their bosses are all paid by the same international holdingcorporation.  But you aren't and can.     I once interviewed a supermarket manager for an article I wrote onshoplifting.  I wanted to find out whether Homer Husband and Harriet Housewifewere boosting expensive food as a response to zooming price increases.  Thevery first words out of his mouth were, "Ahhh, we refer to that sort ofactivity as 'inventory shrinkage' in this business."     Whatever they call it, a lot of people are doing it.     Abbie Hoffman has some interesting ways of stealing from markets that havebeen targeted for whatever reason:o     Empty out a pound box of the cheapest margarine you can find and fill itback up with four sticks of the best butter in the store.o     Sew a bag inside your overcoat to receive cuts of meat.  Don't be greedy;you don't want to look too bulky.o     Two or three phonograph records can be placed inside one of those largefrozen-pizza boxes.o     Fake an epileptic seizure while your partner, who has already cleaned outthe meat counter, flees during the confusion.o     According to Hoffman, stolen food tastes a lot better than store-bought.==============SWIMMING POOLS==============     If your mark has a swimming pool all sorts of additives and accessoriesare available for your incursion into a targeted recreation area.  Dyes are agood choice, and there are many chemicals avaiable to do the job.  Placingcolored dye in the water could create quite an expensive maintenance problem.Heavy doses of salt will create difficulty for your mark, as will fertilizerand the bacteria-inducing chemicals sold for septic systems.     Another swimming-pool additive you could consider is an extract oftoxicodendrol, which is the nonvolatile oil found in the poison-ivy plant somemorable to legions of its fans from experiences in camping, fishing,picnicking, loving, or whatever.  If you've ever had a brush with poison ivy,you can easily imagine what the concentrated extract could do if introducedinto the mark's swimming pool.     It's not very creative, but you could put dead animals in his/her pool.That's why you should always keep several large trash or lawn plastic bags inyour car -- you never know when you're going to happen upon an especiallydisgusting piece of roadkill.  Generally, for swimming pools, the larger thedead animal you can manage to get into the mark's pool the better.  Call thezoo; maybe they'll give you their next dead elephant.  Use a fictitious nameand have the animal sent to a safe mail drop!     Some of my acquaintances belong to esoteric military units like SpecialForces, SEALS, Blue Light, etc.  One of them recently told me about a non-issueapplication of the orange dye marker solution that is normally issued forair-sea rescue work.     My friend recalled, "It happened down South, when we were refusedmembership in a community swimming pool because (1) we were military types and(2) two of our five were black dudes.  Since these civilian bozos were so colorconscious, we decided to give the locals some sensitivity training.     "A friend in Supply got us some orange dye marker, and a week or so laterwe pulled a late-night recon mission into enemy territory.  We loaded us theirlily-white pool with orange dye.  Man, does that stuff work -- even better thanwe thought!  It messed up the filters and pumps something fierce, and it coatedthe bottom and sides of the pool this vivid orange.  Oh yeah, the whole poolfull of water was ruined too.     "This made local TV coverage, and were the city fathers pissed off!  Theyfigured it was us military types, but nobody had any courtroom proof.  Thelocal hoods were afraid to mess with us physically, so the whole thing was adraw.  It cost them a few thousand bucks to get the pool running again.  Bythen, we'd discovered we could enjoy the base pool anyway.  That was ourcontribution to making some bigots a bit less discriminatory."========TEACHERS========     Early one morning before their teacher got to the classroom, some studentspainted a large black/brown spot on the ceiling.  With some deft art touches,it looked as if a huge hole had suddenly broken through.  They piled brokenplaster, ceiling wire, and hunks of lath on the floor beneath the hole.     The teacher was a priss, and when he came in and saw the mess he prancedout to inform the principal.  Quickly, the perpetrators cleaned the water paintoff the ceiling and swept up the floor.  They disposed of the residue and trashon the roof outside of the room.     When the principal and the teacher returned, the students acted inoccentlyconcerned about the teacher's sanity.  The principal asked the teacher toplease stop in and see him at the first available moment.  As he left, theprincipal stared at the teacher for a long, long time.     If you don't like a teacher, here's the ticket, according to that veteranstudent of human affairs Doug Dedge.  You have to get your mark to a librarywhere they use an electronic sensor to catch people taking books out of theplace without proper checkout.  Locate your mark.  Then go to the periodicalssection and page through several magazines until you locate and remove severalof the metallic sensor strips.     Carefully plant these on your mark or on his/her own books, briefcase,overcoat, or whatever.  The idea is to get multiple plantings.  Perhaps adiversion could be created to allow you the few seconds needed to plant thesensors.  Stick around and enjoy the fun when the mark tries to go out thedoor.     Your planted sensors will set off the bell.  This will cause extremeshock, upset, indignation, and confusion.  With luck, only one sensor will befound at first, and the mark will try to leave again.  Round two is also yours.     Because teachers deal with children, they are especially susceptible tochild-molesting charges, deserved or not.  Claude Pendejo's son was accused byhis teacher of cheating on a test and given an F.  The boy, who was quiteinnocent, literally cried his innocence.  No one believed him but his parents.The teacher was especially insolent about the entire matter, refusing to talkwith the parents.  The teachers' union backed their errant member, and thatcaused the principal to shy away from the case.     Claude Pendejo decided that because the teacher had messed up his son, itwas only fitting for the man to become a molestor of a different sort.     After giving the teacher a couple of months to forget the incident,Pendejo acted.  One morning, each home in the neighborhood around this schoolwas posted with a brief letter, run off on a cheap mimeo machine.  The letterstated that the teacher in question had molested the little child of theletter's grieving writer -- a scared mother -- and only now did this parenthave the courage to come forth.  The "writer" of the letter said that theteacher had sexually abused her son on four occasions, and finally the pain andshame had made him come to his parents for salvation.  The "humble mother" saidthe police would do nothing, so she, as a frightened mother, was appealingdirectly to other concerned parents for their help in ridding theirneighborhood school of this horrible beast.     Within three days, the man was blamed (wrongly) for an actual molestingincident totally unrelated to the scam.  Two other kids came forward and"confessed" he had made sexual advances to them (he had not).  The man waswaylaid by two fathers and pushed around, his car was trashed, and theneighborhood cop told him he would have his eye on the man.  The teacher's wifewas a suspicious sort anyway, and this whole thing just fed their maritalfires.  Finally, his supervisor told the man he was too much of a problem andhe ought to consider either moving away or going into a new line of work.  Thishappened after the local paper ran a "guilty or no" story on the whole matter.Since there was no actual proof, the paper was somewhat sympathetic to themark.  Eventually, the whole matter burned down to a few embers of suspicionthat would never die out.=====THEFT=====     Theft and other bits of guerrilla warefare by employees against a despisedcorporation have long, deep roots.  Greedy, embittered, politically alienated,or just plain loose-fingered employees took home an unauthorized twelve billiondollars in 1979.  This bit of larceny is so easy and requires so little thoughtthat most experts regard it as little more than another expense of doingbusiness.     "We figure the cost of a certain percentage of employee theft right inwith our other costs like rent, advertising, overhead, salaries," says businesseconomist Ivo Neglagenti.  "Most companies add this cost right into the amountsthey charge the public for goods and services."     Does that mean if you steal from your employer you are simply stealingfrom yourself?  One anti-corporate guerrilla has a ready response:  "Simplysteal more than your share of the cost.  Like the old bromide goes, never stealanything small, and if you do, do it often."     Abbie Hoffman gives you the operational details in his classic STEAL THISBOOK.  Good luck finding it, though.  It is apparently "out of theft," and nopublisher wishes to reprint it!  Try used-book shops.  It's an instructivebook.     If you're interested in petty larceny, Loran Eugene suggests youexperiment with various sizes of brass washers in coin-operated vendingmachines.  If you don't like a particular newspaper, he suggests you usenumber-fourteen washers in their vending machines, remove all the newspapers,take them into bars and other places, and sell them yourself.     Braden adds.  "Hey, even if the washers don't operate the machines there'salways the hope they will jam the coin slots.  So you don't really lose in anycase."     Obviously, some of the radical advocates of rights for ordinary citizensare both preaching and practicing theft as a form of fighting back.  I wasbrought up to believe that stealing is not nice.  On the other hand, maybe someof these antiestablishment tactics aren't really stealing.  I leave thedecision to you.     Most modern philosophers recognize a major difference between theft forfun, for survival, for a career, and for protest purposes.  As the premiercorrections officer Wallace R. Croup points out, "A common thief will stealfrom anyone, whereas a protestor will steal only from his institutional enemy-- a corporation, utility, or some other establishment target."     Even so, maybe you still have a moral block about theft.  If so, think howthin the dividing line is between business as usual and stealing.  Some of theDetroit auto companies know that their products are dangerous death traps; yetthey sell them anyway.  You pay nine dollars for a tiny container of aprescription drug.  Do you really believe that the compound drug costs thatmuch?  Talk to a salesperson for a large drug company if you doubt me.  I wishyou could see the breakdown of costs in producing laundry detergent.  I workedin advertising.  I saw those figures, and know how many dollars you have to payfor how few cents' worth of materials and labor.     There is a very thin line between business and theft.=======TOILETS=======     If you enjoy playing in the potty without blowing one up, consider thistrick.  Saturate a large dry sponge with a thick starch solution.  Squeeze ittightly as possible with tough string.  Allow the whole thing to drythoroughly.  Then remove the string, and the sponge will stay in its compressedstate.  Put it, or as many as you've made into targeted toilets, flush thesponge down, and walk away from the fun.     It may take a while for the sponge to become wet enough to expand solidly.Have patience -- it will do so soon.  For your purposes, you probably hope itis farther down the drainage system than is convenient for a repairperson toget to easily.  Holy backup!     If you have some of that poison-ivy extract left over from the section onswimming pools, heed Ed Hoover's story.  As a kid, Ed obtained some extract oftoxicodendrol (poison ivy) and applied it liberally to the toilet paper in thecounselors' outhouse at his summer camp.  He said he later did the same thingto the officers' latrine while serving Uncle Sam.  Maybe Ed just has thisproblem with authority figures.  Even so, that's a lot more comfortable thanthe problems his authority figures got wiped out with.     Mower McMurphy sticks closely to commodes.  Like the sticker man fromBoulder, McMurphy has a very sharp, nasty mind and uses creative revenge.  Oneof his classics is to have official-looking warnings printed on permastickstock.  When, for some reason, he gets irritated at someone or something in abar, office building, school, or utility, he will post each restroom stall inthe area.     Each sticker bears an official-looking seal and signature around themessage, which reads:  DANGER:  THIS RESTROOM OFF-LIMITS DUE TO INFECTIOUSVENEREAL DISEASE.  STAY OUT FOR YOUR OWN HEALTH PROTECTION.     In another campaign, McMurphy printed up graffiti-style stickers, which heposted over toilet-paper dispensers in the bathroom of least-favorite marks.The stickers read:  WARNING:  THIS TOILET PAPER HAS BEEN INFECTED WITH A HIGHLYCONTAGIOUS NEW STRAIN OF ASIAN GONORRHEA.  Uh-huh -- I know what you'rethinking.  But, would you really take the chance anyway?     Now, if you wish to be discriminatory, this next trick works best in abathroom frequented by women.  According to nationally known sexist ButchBryant, it is also an old trick -- cheap bathroom humor, Butch calls it.  A gaysort, though, Butch will always settle for a laugh.  Butch once said, "A cheapthrill is better than no thrill."     Lift the seat of the commode, then stretch and place Saran Wrap verytightly across the top of the bowl so no creases show.  Then lower the seatgently.  The trap is set.     Ideally, the mark will come dashing in, sit, and let loose.  Your humorousimagination can finish the rest of this trick, when the trap is sprung, so tospeak.  Butch Bryant says this works best in barrom johns.  Anything you say,Butch.==========LA TURISTA==========     If your mark is traveling into Mexico or some South or Central Americancountry, or even into Canada, you could consider doing your duty as anhonorable citizen and reporting your suspicions to the authorities of thatcountry that he/she is a drug dealer.  It might help to sneak some drugs intothe mark's car, luggage, or clothing prior to his or her hitting a borderpoint.  If you are kindhearted you will have the discovery made on the U.S.side of the border.  If not?  Hey, this is only a book.  It's his/her life.===VIP===     We've all tried to get that always unavailable Very Important Person WhoCan Solve Our Problem on the telephone.  But that Important Person always istied up, is in a meeting, or just stepped out of the office.  So after youwaste your time calling him or her in vain a few times, do it yet one moretime.     This time come armed with the name of the chief executive officer of thecompany.  Get that from the main switchboard operator.  When the unavailableVery Important Person's flunky starts to give you the runaround again, sternlytell the flunky something like this:     "I didn't want to bring [use full name of the chief executive] into thislittle matter.  I thought your [use name of very important person here] couldhandle this him/herself.  I guess not.  Well, I'm calling [first name of chiefexecutive] for a luncheon soon, and I can just ask him/her about this matterthen."     No person wants the superior, especially the chief executive, to thinkthat he/she is incapable of handling routine matters.  Beyond that, the factthat you have namedropped adds a dimension few bureaucratic managers care tocall as a bluff.  It's easier and cheaper to finally talk to you -- and satisfyyou.============WATER WELLS!============     People who live outside the lines of municipal services provide their ownutilities, one of which is a water well.  Normally, these wells are topped by asimple metal cap held in place by several set screws.  It takes only a fewminutes to loosen the screws, remove the cap, and dump a load of modest-sizedroadkill, such as squirrels, small rabbits, rats, birds, etc., down the wellcasing.  Replace the cap and tighten the screws, and the mark will be none thewiser.  For a while.     Water wells are usually purified once a year by adding a gallon of achlorine bleach, such as Clorox, to the well.  This process also oxidizes theiron in the water, turning the liquid a dirty rusty color.  The water nowstinks and tastes awful.  To demolish the quality of your mark's water supplyfor at least a week, dump about ten to fifteen gallons of bleach down the well.     Barfo Renchquist got his nickname as you might imagine.  His favoritewater-well trick is to eat all sorts of multi-colored greasy junk food, likepizza.  He drinks a lot of beer, too.  Primed and loaded, he is driven to themark's water well.  The well cap is removed, and Barfo positions himself overthe well casing and pulls the trigger by sticking his finger down his throat.Barfo does his thing -- all of it down the well.  The well cap is replaced.     "It works best when they don't have too fine a filter on their pump andsome of the small pieces of puke come out the house taps.  A lot of the color,smell and taste almost always comes through.  It's a very demoralizing stunt,"Barfo reports.======WILLS!======     If you have a least-favorite friend, relative, or other family member youwant to shame in front of the others, write him/her into your last will andtestament.  Simply instruct your attorney to include a codicil to the effectthat "I bequeath all my yachts, silver plate, gold bullion and coins, foreignholdings, carriages, and aircraft to [name of mark]."  Obviously, you had bestnot have any of those items, or you suddenly become the mark.  This stunt is ablow from the grave.  Maybe you won't know how it works.  Maybe, though, youwill.  Is there revenge after death?_______________________________________________________________________________==================Getting Even Index==================File ###:  Title (approximate length in K)==========================================File 001:  Additives (8.75k)                                            -File 002:  Airlines (6.25k)                                             -File 003:  Animals (4.5k)                                               -File 004:  Apartments (8.25)                                            -File 005:  Assassination (3.5k)                                         -File 006:  Auto Dealers (3.75k)                                         -File 007:  Banks (4.25k)                                                -File 008:  Bikers (3.5k)                                                -File 009:  Books (3.25k)                                                -File 010:  Campuses (4.25k)                                             -File 011:  Carbide (4.0k)                                               -File 012:  Cars (13.5k)                                                 -File 013:  Charities (2.75k)                                            -File 014:  Cheese, Child Abuse, CIA [combined] (4.0k)                   -File 015:  CB Radio (3.0k)                                              -File 016:  Classified Ads (6.0k)                                        -File 017:  Clergy, Coins [combined] (4.5k)                              -File 018:  Computers (3.25k)                                            -File 019:  Contractors (2.75k)                                          -File 020:  Credit Cards (4.5k)                                          -File 021:  Delivery of Consumables (2.5k)                               -File 022:  Dirty Old Men (4.5k)                                         -File 023:  Drugs (4.25k)                                                -File 024:  Environmental Rapists (8.25k)                                -File 025:  Explosives (4.5k)                                            -File 026:  Fillers, Forgery, Garage Sales [combined] (5.5k)             -File 027:  Gases (4.0k)                                                 -File 028:  Graffiti (3.75k)                                             -File 029:  Highways (4.0k)                                              -File 030:  Hookers (2.5k)                                               -File 031:  Hotels (4.0k)                                                -File 032:  Homes (8.0k)                                                 -File 033:  Insurance Companies (4.0k)                                   -File 034:  IRS (3.5k)                                                   -File 035:  Thomas Jefferson (1.75k)                                     -File 036:  Joggers (4.0k)                                               -File 037:  Laundromats (2.5k)                                           -File 038:  Lawns (4.75k)                                                -File 039:  Lawyers (4.0k)                                               -File 040:  License Plates (1.75k)                                       -File 041:  Ma Bell (8.0k)                                               -File 042:  Mail (5.25k)                                                 -File 043:  Mail Drops (2.25k)                                           -File 044:  Marriage (4.25k)                                             -File 045:  Media (7.0k)                                                 -File 046:  Medical (6.25k)                                              -File 047:  Military (7.5k)                                              -File 048:  Motion Pictures (3.5k)                                       -File 049:  Municipal Services (5.75k)                                   -File 050:  Neighbourhoods (2.75k)                                       -File 051:  Nixon, Richard M.
