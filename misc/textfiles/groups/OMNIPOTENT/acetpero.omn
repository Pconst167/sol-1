This explosive is to be usedin the fabrication of detonators.MATERIALS AND THEIR SOURCES=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=[1] Hydrogen Peroxide    - Hair bleach (15-25 volume content)    - Drug stores and hair supply stores[2] Acetone    - Hardware stores, drug stores[3] Sulfuric Acid    - Clear battery acid boiled until white fumes appear[4] Eye dropper or syringe with glass tube[5] Graduated cylinder (cc or ml) or other measuring device[6] Thermometer (0 to 100 degrees C.)[7] Glass containers[8] Large pan[9] Ice and salt[10] Water[11] Paper TowelsPROCEDURE=-=-=-=-=[1] Measure 30 milliliters of acetone and 50 milliliters of hydrogen peroxide    into a glass container and mix thoroughly.[2] Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture by placing its container in a larger one    containing a mixture of ice, salt, and water.NOTE:  Because of the lighter inner container being buoyant in the larger outer~~~~~  container, it is necessary to secure it so that it won't fall over into       the ice, salt, water mixture.[3] Cool the acetone/peroxide mixture to 5 degrees C.[4] Add 2.5 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid to the acetone/peroxide    mixture slowly, drop by drop, with the use of an eye dropper.  Stir the    mixture during the addition of the sulfuric acid with a thermometer,    keeping the temperature between 5 - 10 degrees C.  Should the temperature    rise above 10 degrees C., stop adding the sulfuric acid and continue    stirring until the temperature drops again to 5 degrees C., then continue    adding the sulfuric acid.[5] After all the sulfuric acid has been added, continue stirring the mixture    for another five minutes.[6] Let the acetone/peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture stand in the ice/water/salt    bath or remove the inner container and place it in an ice box for 12 to 24    hours.[7] After 12 hours white crystals of acetone peroxide will precipitate out of    the once clear solution.  Precipitation should be completed after 24 hours.CAUTION:  At this point the mixture is a primary explosive.  Keep away from~~~~~~~~  shock, friction and flame.[8] Filter the mixture through a paper towel into a container to collect the    solid particles.[9] Wash the solid particles collected in the paper towel with small amounts of    ice cold water poured over them.  Discard the liquid in the container.[10] Place these explosive crystals in a container and allow to dry.CAUTION:  Handle the dry crystals with great care.  Do not scrape or handle it~~~~~~~~  roughly.  Keep away from sparks or open flame.  Store in a cool,          dark, dry place.HOW TO USE:=-=-=-=-=-=Acetone peroxide is a powerful initiator and can be used by itself as the mainfiller when making homemade detonators.  Using 2-1/2" lengths of brass orcopper tubing with one end sealed shut with either solder or epoxy resin, beginby partially filling the tube with acetone peroxide and compressing with aloading press.  Continue this process until the explosive is within 1/2" of thetop.  Stopper the open end tightly with a cork or wood stopper.  When ready touse, remove stopper and insert time fuse.  Seal around fuse and tube and insertinto the main charge to a depth of 2".  These caps will detonate mostexplosives.NOTE:  These detonators should be used within 7 days of their manufacture and~~~~~  should be stored in a cool, dry place.
