<H1>Groups: The Phido Phreaks</H1>
<P>
A relatively minor textfile-writing group, but still very good friends of the
Works BBS, The Phido Phreaks came out of a Fido BBS in Michigan called
"Thieves' World", run by one Thomas Covenant. 
<P>
Thomas Covenant discovered textfiles.com and provided me with his collection of 
Phido Phreak files, including lots I didn't have and not providing me some I did.
He wrote most of the descriptions you see below, as well as this note:

<I>
All works by The Silver Ghost unless otherwise indicated. Comments by the 
carbon based life form formerly known as Thomas Covenant, now going by
<A HREF="mailto:frogfarm@hempseed.com">damaged justice (frogfarm@hempseed.com)</A>.
<P>
I have refrained from attempting to describe TSG's works of fiction, as no
words of mine could do them justice.

The only reason I wrote this was a case of "sequel fever" after reading Daemon's <A HREF="smurfkil.ph2">Smurf Kill</A>. The astute and discriminating reader will quickly ascertain that it took me much longer to find a unique and readable voice than it did TSG.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="chldmagc.tsg">chldmagc.tsg</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 2085<BR><TD> A Childrens' Guide to Magic. Douglas Adams has nothing on TSG when it comes to cynicism.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="classhot.tsg">classhot.tsg</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 4432<BR><TD> What's Hot and What's Classic. With Warelok and I pumping out "What's Hot 'n What's Not", TSG decided to gently take us to task by reminding us that popularity is not an indicator of elegance. I have seldom received a more resounding and welcome chiding.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD ALIGN=TOP><A HREF="couldhpn.tsg">couldhpn.tsg</A>  <tab to=T><TD> 7309<BR><TD> It Could Happen To You. TSG plays divorce counselor, in a style that reminds me of Dave Barry.

Published in an April Fool's issue of <A HREF="http://www.phrack.com/">Phrack</A>, this is one of my fondest memories, but is nowhere near as funny unless you're familiar with the works of the <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/groups/metalcommunications/">Metal Communications</A> group.
