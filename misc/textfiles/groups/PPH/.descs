1stcamp.tsg Typical First Campaign. We *wish* this was non fiction. Think "Eric Encounters the Dread Gazebo".
a-plea.tsg A Plea to Musicians. As they say, true perfection of design is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to take away. SG presents an eloquent case for simplicity.
bakintim.pph Back in Time, by The Silver Ghost
bakintim.tsg Back In Time. Fiction.
cabgnite.ph2 Night of the Cabbage Patch Kids by Thomas Covenant. The only reason I wrote this was a case of "sequel fever" after reading Daemon's <A HREF="smurfkil.ph2">Smurf Kill</A>. The astute and discriminating reader will quickly ascertain that it took me much longer to find a unique and readable voice than it did TSG.
chldmagc.tsg A Childrens' Guide to Magic. Douglas Adams has nothing on TSG when it comes to cynicism.
classhot.tsg What's Hot and What's Classic. With Warelok and I pumping out "What's Hot 'n What's Not", TSG decided to gently take us to task by reminding us that popularity is not an indicator of elegance. I have seldom received a more resounding and welcome chiding.
couldhpn.tsg It Could Happen To You. TSG plays divorce counselor, in a style that reminds me of Dave Barry.
cristdnd.tsg Christianity: Concerns for the AD&D player.  This is even funnier if you've read the original that it parodies.
feelgood.pph Feeling Good, by Thomas Covenant
fuckwrld.ph2 How to Fuck Up the World by Thomas Covenant.  Published in an April Fool's issue of <A HREF="http://www.phrack.com/">Phrack</A>, this is one of my fondest memories, but is nowhere near as funny unless you're familiar with the works of the <A HREF="http://www.textfiles.com/groups/metalcommunications/">Metal Communications</A> group.
futureae.tsg The Future Evolution of ASCII Express. AE was one of the most popular pieces of Apple software ever. Here, SG extrapolates from then-current trends to speculate on upcoming features and developments.  Nostradamus he ain't, but I trust him more than John Dvorak... 
heavy.tsg ...heavy... here there be monsters
hot-not1.ph2 What's Hot 'n What's Not part One.
hot-not3.ph2 What's Hot 'n What's Not part Three.
hot-not4.ph2 What's Hot 'm What's Not part Four (Part Two is missing in action), by the Warelok. These are either an indicator of our cultural brainwashing or a concise time capsule for data archaeologists. Or something.
intrcept.tsg The Interceptor. Fiction.
k-rad.pph The K-Rad, by The Silver Ghost
k-rad.tsg The K-Rad. Fiction.
maiden.pph Maiden Taiwan, by The Silver Ghost
maiden.tsg Maiden Taiwan. Fiction.
mtg616.ph2 The Rise and Fall of the 616 Users Meeting by Lunatic Surfer. Relatively objective, if short, account of the first major get-together for Thieve's World users and assorted others.
official.pph What Is Phido Phreaks?
onewish.tsg One Wish. here there be monsters
outtakes.tsg Outtakes. A few half-baked ideas that never got finished.
parodies.tsg Parodies. Short and snappy; the only reason TSG didn't parody me was because my pitifully low output prevented any analysis of my style. (Lucky for me I didn't develop one until much later...)
pphistry.hum  The History of the Phido Phreaks, by Double Helix
progtech.tsg Programming Techniques (that you won't find in textbooks). TSG may have recanted some of these statements since he wrote this, but it still rings pretty true. When real life hits where the rubber meets the road, something's gotta give.
rap.tsg The Penultimate Rap, or, The Next Step Is Free Verse. White boys (and geeks) *can* rap, if they put their minds to it.
smurfkil.ph2 Smurf Kill by the Daemon. We had to have someone around who made me look sane by comparison.
ultimate.tsg The Ultimate Computer Program. More accurately, "The Ultimate Computer Programming Language". He makes it look so easy!
witchunt.pph  My name is Erika, and I am a witch
