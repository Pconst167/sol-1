<H1>Groups: The Phido Phreaks</H1>
<P>
A relatively minor textfile-writing group, but still very good friends of the
Works BBS, The Phido Phreaks came out of a Fido BBS in Michigan called
"Thieves' World", run by one Thomas Covenant. 
<P>
Thomas Covenant discovered textfiles.com and provided me with his collection of 
Phido Phreak files, including lots I didn't have and not providing me some I did.
He wrote most of the descriptions you see below, as well as this note:

<I>
All works by The Silver Ghost unless otherwise indicated. Comments by the 
carbon based life form formerly known as Thomas Covenant, now going by
<A HREF="mailto:frogfarm@hempseed.com">damaged justice (frogfarm@hempseed.com)</A>.
<P>
I have refrained from attempting to describe TSG's works of fiction, as no
words of mine could do them justice.
