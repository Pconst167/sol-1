This is the first real FISH Util.

Punk Rock Girl's HAHA Dialer.

To use it just run it.

When it asks you for the COMPORT type a number.

When it asks you for the DELAY this is the time it waits from 
 when it picks up the fone until it hangs up and cycles again.
 Use something about 20 since dialing is slow unless you init 
 your modem to be fast... but modem init comes in the next version
 so SUCKS FOR YOU.

When it asks for REPEATS this is the number of times you
 wanna call the people. Any number from 1-2147483647. Seriously.

Number to call is obvious. Dont put a dash in it. You could but
 it is pointless so grow up.

To cancel the process just press a key and it will abort. 
Error messages are returned in TEXT not so you dont have to remember
what ERROR 102 is or any of that shit.

Look for version whateverversionIwritenext to come out soon.
I'll add an INIT string option and make the interface more sexy.

Possibly uses for this:

Radio stations on request day
Super markets
Pizza parlors
911  :) (if you are stupid)
Your X-girl/boy.friend
Shitty BBSs
Good BBSs
Grandmas
Lawyers
Political parties
1-800-DENTIST
1-800-PIN-DROP
The white house
Schools

P.S. Dont blame me if they call the cops on you for bugging the shit
out of them. Its your fault. Im not your mother. You are responsible
for your own actions. bla bla bla.
