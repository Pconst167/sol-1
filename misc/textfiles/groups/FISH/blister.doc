Thank you for downloading Blister. 
The easiest to use BBS Lister of all time.

Disclaimer: If somebody messes up this program and makes it do bad things
then it is not my fault. I wrote it as a BBS list ONLY and all damages 
resulting from this program are either the fault of the user, or some
malicious third party that enjoys tampering with shareware.

This program is Sorta Shareware/Freeware meaning that you can use it for
as long as you want to without ANY obligation to me, except that you will
burn in hell for eternity. Or you could register it and give $5 and I would 
send you all the updates that follow.


Files in the BLISTER1.ZIP archive:
BLISTER.EXE
BLISTER.DOC
BLISTER.LST

How To Use Blister: The blister.exe program and the BLISTER.LST program
are all that are required. Simply run BLISTER as door from your BBS.
The only problems I can forsee is that I wrote this program for use
with SEARCHLIGHT BBS Software. Thus it has no internal COM routines of
its own. This will change in future version but for now it really doesnt
even need them. To run Blister on your BBS you should make sure that you
have your software set to use its own com routines on this program. This
is done in Searchlight by setting the Communications Support to Standard.
If your BBS does not offer a forced COM output like Searchlight then
you may consider using a program like DOORWAY which will send ANYTHING over
a modem.

Wanna know all about the program? Why dont you just run it and save me 
some writting? 

Requirements: The program is relatively small so unless you are running
something really sick like an 8088 with 256K of RAM you should have no
problems. 

The program DOES require that the BLISTER.LST file be in the
same directory as the EXE file however, so DONT delete it. This is a TEXT
file that holds the BBS information from the users. The file should currently
contain an entry for The Sect bbs. If it doesnt then you have not recieved
an original copy of the program and should delete it, it may have been 
tampered with.

What will future versions have?

-Internal Com Routines for WAY more compatability
-A better menu
-A better everything
-Option to download the bbs list via the protocol of YOUR choice
-Search options (i.e. search for an entry by BBS name)

Any suggestions are appreaciated and usually ignored. Just kidding.
If you want to gimme some input you can find me at the following locations:

Fall and Winter: NREESE@YVAX.BYU.EDU
Spring and Summer: NATHAN@FATAL.COM

Or you can call The Sect Of The Trampoline People BBS which features the
latest version of this program at: (801)375-3058
But beware! I am moving soon so the number will change. Your chances are 
better if you use the internet mail adresses above.

Wanna send me money for this program and possibly extend my life another
day? Send five bucks to: Nathan Reese

Check, Money Order, CASH... we do it all.


Until The Next Version: Buh Bye
