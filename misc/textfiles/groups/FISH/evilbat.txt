                Evil Batch

                    Deletion of everything from a batch file! Avoid the
annoying DOS:   "Are You Sure:" and just wipe it all out!

To pipe a 'Y' into the 'del *.* ' command, here is whatcha do:

Create a file called 'Y.TXT'.
Type one letter (Y) in the file, and press Enter.
Save the file.
from the dos prompt ( or batch file ) type: 

del. < Y.txt

It wil pipe the Y into the del *.* command, and not prompt you for a Y/N.

This is good for putting into people batch files and some such stuff.
