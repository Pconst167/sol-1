        I just had to show this neat little batch file for all
        you users who call BBS's and hate it when the sysop is
        UN-Available. It is easy to use too! Instructions:

        1. Upload this file to The BBS you called
        2. Use the view/type command and view g.bat
        3. It will beep the Sys-op for 1 minute and drive him insane!
        4. Make sure you upload only G.BAT dont zip it or anything
        5. The End

The file you make should be called G.BAT and look like this for about 2 lines     

^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G^G

thats is. Control G will beep when you view it. Slbbs RUNS a .BAT file when
it views it. This could be useful in the future but since I run an SLBBS
I wont tell you what to do with this. SYSOPS BEWARE!
     

                       Call these great boards!
