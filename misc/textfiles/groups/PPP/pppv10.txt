I hate my nieghbor. The guy is a MAJOR prick. I needed a way to get back

at him - but it had to be legal. I dont need to be in any trouble with

the law. If you hate your nieghbor as much as I hate mine, then this

file is for you.



** Vol. 10 **





1) Accidently spill a gallon of anti-freeze on their grass. That stuff

   will kill mega grass. If your nieghbor is a Mr. Fucking Green Thumb

   like mine then this will drive him crazy. Enjoy yourself while you 

   watch him work his ass off in 90 degree heat to save his lawn.



2) Obtain a small animal and put it in his dryer vent. Imagine that smell

   of toasted bunny in his house when he turns on his dryer.



3) On a hot summer night get a small transistor radio with some good 

   batteries in it. Put it outside his bedroom window and sorta camoflage

   it. Put it on a polka station or something and let it play. It will

   probably will only work for a night but he wont get any sleep.



4) When he goes out to start his charcoals and goes back inside. Sneak over

   with a small pail of water. Do I need to say more?



5) If you could obtain an Iraqi flag and get access to his roof, you might

   wish to place it on his house.



6) Buy a truckload of top soil for about $60. Pay for it up front and have

   it delivered to his house and dumped. Of course this is gonna cost

   you money, so ya will feel better knowing he will have to pay twice

   that to have it removed. 



7) Throw a roach killing fog bomb into his open garage.



8) Have flowers delivered to his wife. With a very spicy note attached.



9) If they leave their car window open then run up and slip a picture

   of a really hot chick in the glove box or console. Hopefully his

   wife will drive the car next.



10) Form nice wet plaster of paris balls and stuff them into his gutter.





Well so it was only ten. I will have more in the future.
