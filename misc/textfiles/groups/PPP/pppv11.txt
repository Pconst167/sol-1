This is the second in my series on Stoner Stuff. I dont know how many 

there will be, so dont ask. Well I have been trying to write this thing for

awhile now, but am finally getting down to it. Of course, as I write I am

very, very, very high. So dont complain if my punctuation and spelling are

a little off. Actually you could complain if you wanted to, but I really

wouldnt care cause I am too high to think about asuch trivial things..

Onward.





** Vol 9 **



The topic of part two is going to be about creative (and sometimes destruc-

tive) things you can do for entertainment while you are enjoying your 

favorite buzz. 



Well - obviously you can write a gphile if ya feel like giving your brain

a workout while you are high. It is amazing how creative you become when

you are high. Well, maybe it isnt creative. Maybe it is just that when you

are high that everything you do seems creative. Doesnt matter, just as

long as you are getting the most out of each time you smoke pot. 



One thing I love to do when I am high is design new smoking devices. My

feeling is that you can never have too many bowls, bongs, or roach clips.

If ya still live at home with mom and dad, then the best thing for you

to make is a 'NO BUST TUBE'. Thats right. Now you can get high in your

own home and not worry about getting busted becuase of the smoke smell.

All ya have to do is get an empty toilet paper roll or paper towel roll 

(only difference is size - but paper towel roll works better) and stuff

the damn thing solid with Bounce (r) dryer sheets. Just a mental note -

DONT buy the unscented, casue that would kinda blow the point of this.

Now after you have it stuffed full, take a quarter sheet of bounce and 

place it over the end of the tube (kinda like a screen) and tape it in

place with electrical tape. (any tape will do - but electrical tape looks

cool). Then go to your favorite spot and smoke up. Just blow your hit

into the open end of the tube. Some smoke will get absorbed into the Bounce.

The stuff that doesnt will smell April Fresh. (yea I know that is Downy).



So ya dont feel like making something. Want to be excited a little more.

Well you could get really high then read the PPP file on Phun In Stores.

But here are some more neat things to do. Go collect Recycle bins. This

is always a lot of fun, but can get you in big trouble. Then take these

bins and drop them off at someones house that you really dislike. Imagine

the suprise when they wake up with 200 orange bins in their front yard.

Since these bins fit inside each other, they are very easy to collect.

Another fun thing to do is collect road horses and orange cones. Set up

your own road block or construction zone. Usually the cops will not 

even do anything, cause they assume there is construction. Another great

thing for high spirits and great laughs is to create something that looks

like a human or get something that looks human. (an old manican is great

for this trick).. put some clothes on your 'human'.. tie a rope around

its neck, and bring him to an overpass. tie the other end of the rope to

the overpass. drop your 'human' over the overpass and let him hang.

Imagine Mom, Dad and little Johnny on the way home from Grandma's house

and they see him hanging over Interstate 94 with a sign attached that says

"JESUS TOLD ME TO!".. Another fun thing would be to safely secure your

'human' to a skateboard and roll him out into moving traffic. Of course

that would cost you a skateboard.



Another really fun thing to do while you are high is to watch old reruns

of M*A*S*H. This has got to be the best show on TV while you are high.

Some shows really suck while you are high. Hospital shows like Trapper John

MD really suck dick. Most sit-coms (with the exception of Threes Company)

are very good shows to watch while you are high. 



I like to confuse myself when I am high and play mind games with myself

and other people. One real fun thing to do to yourself is to take all

the cassette tapes that you own and take them out of the cases. Hide

the tapes themselves around the house and leave the cases in the other room.

Now go try to find them one at a time. A great mind game to play on a dear

friend is to hide his remote control while he is high. Guranteed he will

not stop looking for it until he finds it. Stones people are soo lazy.



If you have a girlfriend (boyfriend - whichever the case may be) then

there really is only one thing to do when you are high. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.



Im sorry but if ya need instructions for that then you need to stop 

getting high cause your brain is just far to smoldered.





I would like to thank Michael Jordan for giving me the inspiration to

write this file. I have always wanted to fly as high as he can.
