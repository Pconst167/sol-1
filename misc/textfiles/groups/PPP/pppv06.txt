**INTRO**

This is a file on fighting to win.

**VOL #6**

    This is my first attempt at writing a file dedicated to
self-defense.  I wish to make it clear that I am not an
ANARCHIST - I believe in government, I believe in the police, I
even believe in taxes. (Sometimes).  However, the police are
never around when one needs them.  Therefore it is sometimes
required for one's well-being to be able to kick the living shit
out of an aggressor.

    A few things to remember:

o   This is not boxing.  Nobody is going to step in to stop the
    fight if you end up unconscious.

o   This is not wrestling.  Don't pull any punches or do tricky
    moves.  (Noone in the history of the world has used a move he
    learned from watching wrestling to win a fight)

o   There's no such thing as fighting dirty.  If it keeps you
    alive, it's fair.

    Ok, now, the specifics:

    If you are fighting someone who is obviously better equipped
    to win, RUN.  Being brave doesn't equal being smart.

    If you thought the above line was directed towards someone
    else, the section below is for you:

    FIGHTING AND WINNING:

    When fighting, aim for certain points.  These points are:



             _____
            | O O | <-------- The eyes (Classic 3 Stooges)
            |  <  | <-------- Bridge of nose or right below nose
            | --- | <-------- Below ear, next to jaw
            |_____| <-------- Base of skull
          ____| |___<-------- Base of neck
         /
       /  /|       |
      /  / |       |
      | |  |   X <----------- Solar plexus (Right in middle,
      | |  |       |          below rib cage.)
      |||| |       |
           /       \
          /   . . <---------- Duh........
          |   / \    |
          |  |   |   |
          |  |   |   | <----- Knee joint
          |  |   |   |
          |   \ <------------ Stomp on foot, right near ankle
           \__/


     Nose:  If you strike with the edge of your hand, karate
     chop style, right below the eyes, you can cause SERIOUS
     pain.  Strike right below the nose and it's bad enough to
     cause unconsciousness.

     Ear:   Below the ear and behind the jaw is a small
     indentation.  Press on it with your thumb.  Ouch.
     Jab with your thumb right at that spot, and you'll cause
     pain, unconscious, and if you do it too hard, death.

     Base of skull:  Karate chop yourself in the back of your
     neck.  Aim upwards.  There are two big tendons that form a
     large flat area.  Strike in this area, and you'll nail some
     nerves.  It feels like an electric shock.  Do it hard, and
     it feels like a 220 volt line running head to foot.

     Base of neck: I mean the place where you see spies in spy
     movies karate chop.  You won't knock anybody out with this, but you
     can disable their arm pretty well.  If you hit their collar
     bone, you'll hear a loud crack.  They won't be able to
     move their arm after that.

     Solar plexus - Jab with a finger.  They won't be able to
     breathe.

     Testicles - Last resort if you want to retain SOME dignity.

     Knee joint - If you're knocked down, hook your right ankle
     around their right heel, and kick their kneecap with your
     left foot.  No more skiing.  Ever.  If you do this, you may
     be sued, so only use it if you're dead meat.

     Foot - If grabbed from behind, stomp their foot, and drive
     your elbow into their solar plexus.

                         WEAPONS:

    Weapons are good and bad.  Good when you've got them, bad
    otherwise.  Stay away from knives and guns - It's too easy
    to accidentally kill someone.  (Killing is not good.  Forget
    what TV shows tell you - Kill someone and you will not have
    a life worth living anymore, unless you can PROVE it was
    self-defense.)  I use a stun gun.  SG's are non-lethal and
    safe.  Get a good one - 100k volts or more.  I use a 50,000
    volt gun, and it takes 3 seconds of contact to subdue.  Get
    a 120kV and your attacker will be airborne in 1 to 1.5
    seconds.  Another goody is a thonged club.  A steel bar with
    a strong nylon thong is intimidating and quick.  Just don't
    hit the person's head if you want to stay out of jail -
    Stick to forearms and hipbones.  Nice and painful.
    Also - Don't neglect our friend, the bullwhip.  Those whips
    exceed Mach 1 at the tips.  (The crack you hear is a sonic
    boom)  Extremely non-lethal and painful as hell.
