Funny, I think this is the first PPP file in which a disclaimer would
make absolutly no sense whatsoever...  Once you master these techniques,
which takes a long time, you might find this better than LSD, both
mentally and legally.  This the first volume is on Lucid Dreaming.
Meditation, OBE's, and other stuff is forthcoming.

Lucid Dreaming is the act of entering into a dream with full conscious
awareness or gaining this awareness in the midst of a dream.  Once you
realize that your dream 'is but a dream' you can begin to control it in
magnificent and fascinating ways.  Extremely proficient Lucid Dreamers
can use the Lucid Dream as a stepping stone to an even more interesting
state -- the out-of-body state. (If there is a next file by me it will
be on OBE's)

Most of the information I will be presenting in this file has been
condensed from the three sources I learned from.  A book by Stephen
LaBerge, a Stanford research psychologist, called Lucid Dreaming The
power of Being awake and aware in your dreams.  A book called Lucid
Dreams in 30 Days The Creative sleep Program by Keith Harary and Pamela
Weintraub, and an article in Omni magazine (I forgot which month and I
have since lost the mag).

Before one can get to the actual Lucid Dreaming state one must begin to
pay more attention to dreams.  A dream journal filled out first thing
EVERY morning is ideal.  You could also keep a dictaphone by your bed
and before going to sleep tell yourself to wake up after each dream so
that you can record it.  Merely keeping a record of your dreams is not
enought though.  You must analyze each one; they often hold important
messages.  A good book on analysis is Ann Faradays, The Dream Game.
Once you ha ve gotten a message from a dream follow through on it.  If
you dream about a surprise test next thursday in Group Sex 101 for
instance, you should study a little bit harder.  There may be no
surprise test coming up but your subconscious may be telling you to work
harder in order to succeed.  If you record then ignore your dreams you
are telling your subconscious they are not important and are drastically
reducing your chances of Luciditiy. Once you acquire good dream recall
go over the past few weeks dreams.  Look for any instantaneous shifts in
perspective, incongruities in time and space.  During your waking hours
start checking for similar incongruities.  (If you don't understand what
I mean by incongruities then I reccomend reading an article called
Welcome to the Dreamtime in issue # 28 of Magical Blend magazine.)  Tell
yourself before falling to sleep that you will notice these
incongruities w hile they are taking place.  (It may help to do this in
a light state of self-hypnosis)  Eventually you will spot one and then
you will realize "Hey, I'm dreaming!  Holy shit, this is kic..."  If you
get too excited at success you will wake up.

Now that you've become conscious the problem is keeping alert.
Constantly do things like look at the backs of your hands.  If you feel
the dream begining to fall apart it helps to twirl about in circles (at
least it does for me).

The method above is great except for the fact that by using it you
cannot enter the lucid dreaming state at will.  You just have to be
lucky enough to spot some oddity in a dream.  The next method is harder
but better.

Find some thought or image to cling to as you go asleep.  While keeping
your image in mind, observe your mind as you fall asleep.  Eventually
you will enter into a dream with full consciousness.
     
Practice makes almost perfect but takes a long time.  It's worth it
though.  Once you become proficient you can explore all sorts of strange
things.  For example in one of my dreams I wandered through a bowl of
Lucky Charms.  Each grain of cereal was like a mountain and every
marshmellow vibrated with intense color.  I made my dog start lapping
them up.  She lapped me up.  I then traveled through my dogs innards.
I've never had an experience that intense using LSD.

Once you've acquires some of these basic the important thing to do is
experiment.  Find new methods that work for you as an individual.  AND
PLEASE if you come up with a really great way of inducing a lucid dream
or if you just have a really intense one leave me some mail so I can
include it in a future file. 

I've barely touched upon any of the significant points on Lucid
Dreaming.  If you are interested in acquiring this ability I HIGHLY
reccomend Stephen LaBerge's book.  It has sections on the history and on
more technical aspects.  It's in paperback and you should find it in any
regular bookstore for $3.95 or if you just have a question then you can
leave comments to me at one of the systems listed below as 'John
Constantine'.
