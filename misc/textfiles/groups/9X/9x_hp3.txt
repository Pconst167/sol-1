              Author : OneThought
              Subject: Hacking the HP3000/MPE Platform

                 
  There have been several write ups written in the past about the
MPE operating system and how to hack it. To me many of these are
out of date with the times or havent gone into certin aspects of
the MPE-iX OS. To start this off i am going to shatter the myth 
right now that the MPE is a out of date operating system and is 
"not worth hacking" a phrase i have heard more then once now a 
days. The HP3000/MPE OS is still ideal for a small work place of
10-15 terminals, several of these servers networked together creates 
a powerful accounting and work system , Infact the MPE OSes latest 
version was released in 1995 (MPE-iX 5.0) and is already being picked
up by several companies. Right now you are asking yourself "Why should
i hack a HP3000?". Besides being a fun system to navigate around, in 
many cases HP3000s have some very good information inside of them. 
Credit Card #s, Employees personal information, Payroll files are 
all kept on HP3000s.

                     #Finding a HP3000.#

 When it comes down to finding a HP3000 your options are limited.
Your best luck will definetly be scanning business exchanges, However
you may also find a few inside the network information system of some
unix boxes on the net. You will know when you have found one by the
MPE XL: Prompt on older MPEs,MPE/iX, or MPE/V. If you are unsure of 
one being a HP3000 simply type some random letters at the prompt and 
press enter. If it is truely a HP3000 you will get the message 
"EXPECTED HELLO COMMAND".

                      #Getting inside.#

 If you are attempting to hack a unsecured HP3000 then factory 
defauts will suffice most of the time. The following is a list
of default accounts and some password protected accounts.

Use the following default accounts listed above to login as
souch. 

        :HELLO MGR.SYS,PUB
                   
           
   Login Command: HELLO    
   Username     : MGR
   Account name : SYS
   Group Name   : PUB

 When trying account and user names sometimes you will get the 
message "ACCOUNT EXISTS, USERNAME DOES NOT". This means that you
have enterd a valid account but not a valid user name. The same
goes for "ACCOUNT/USERNAME EXIST BUT NOT IN HOME GROUP". Here
you must include a valid group name with the login account name
and user name.   

*Note The group name is not required to be typed at the login prompt
most of the time.


  #Barriers that will stand in the way of gaining access to a HP3000.#

 Terminal password. Sometimes you will log in on a default account
and then recieve the prompt

TERMINAL PASSWORD:

 The terminal password is a eight bit alpha password that is not
a normal feature of HP3000s, But some system administrators request
it being on a new system. The only way to get by this is a brute
force attack, or going out and doing some field work i.e trashing
at the companys location,social engineering, etc etc.

 Another problem you may run across is a terminal that will not
accept logins from certin accounts. When running into this you will
need to find another account that can login on that terminal.

Case in point:

CONNECT 9600/ARQ/V32/LAPM/V42BIS
MPE XL:HELLO OPERATOR.SYS
HP3000  RELEASE: B.40.00   USER VERSION: B.40.00

YOU ARE AT A TERMINAL THAT
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE
 SO NOW I LOG YOU OFF.

END OF PROGRAM
CPU=1. CONNECT=1. FRI, JUN 28, 1996,  6:11 PM.

NO CARRIER

Something else you may run into is closed sessions. This means that
at that time the system cannot create a new session for a number of 
reasons, Maximum of users are already signed on or logins are not allowed
at that time. The best thing to do when running into that is to try again 
every few hours till you are allowed to start a new session.

Case in point:

CONNECT 9600/ARQ/V32/LAPM/V42BIS
MPE XL: HELLO MGR.RJE

CAN'T START A NEW SESSION (CIERR 970)

NO CARRIER

 The last thing i will cover when it comes to barriers on HP3000s
is the VESOFT add on. I will not go into this in depth but just give 
you a rough over view. First off to identify a system running VESOFT
you will have MPE/V: as your prompt. There will be no default accounts
on this system, if you get in by other means it will be extremly 
restrictive and secure. Your best hope here is to give up.

The first thing that you will want to do once inside is find out what 
access (if any) that you have. This is done by doing a LISTACCT.

Case in point:

:LISTACCT

CAP: AM,ND,SF,BA,IA

Most of this is self explanitory. The imprtant part to look at
is the CAP: section. Here is the capeability list needed to understand
what access you have.

Abrev.     Capeability.

SM         System Manager
AM         Account Manager
AL         Account Librarian  
GL         Group Librarian
DI         Diagnostician
OP         System Supervisor
NA         Network Administrator
NM         Node Manager
SF         Permanent Files 
ND         Access to nonsharable I/O devices  
UV         Use Volumes
CV         Create Volumes 
CS         Use Communications Subsystem
PS         Programmatic Sessions
LG         User Logging
PH         Process Handling
DS         Extra Data Segments
MR         Multiple RINs
PM         Privilaged mode
IA         Interactive Access
BA         Local Batch Access

Now compare the chart i have just included with what ever
account you have. This will dictate what privilaged commands
you may be able to execute as i will describe later in this file.

                 #Making yourself an account#

  Making yourself an account requires SM or AM access. On some ocasions
you will not be able to make an account with AM access if the System 
Manager has modified your account. You will be able to give your new
account equal access as the one you are on when making it.  

Case in point:

:NEWUSER   <User id> <Group Id> <Password>

      The same can also be said for the following commands..

:NEWGROUP  <Group ID>     *Creates a new group, very noticeable

:PURGEUSER <User ID>      *Delites a user   

:PURGEGROUP <Group ID>    *Delites a group. 

                     #Time to look around.#

You now have hopefully created a new account and know what access
you have. Now it is time to check the system out. First you will need
to know how to use the help file, as HPs may differ from version
to version. Type HELP <item you need help with> and it will bring
up other words to look at or a section of the help file. Do NOT type
HELP as the entire MPE manuel will be scrolled on the screen, Taking 
aproximetly 18 minutes to be fully scrolled. 

  To find out how big this system is and what devices are available

 I hope this file will spawn possible intrest once again in HP3000s
and the MPE Platform. HP will continue to support the MPE platform
for a very long time and with the extensive business software and
porting of unix to MPE systems you should expect to see these systems
for a few more decades. Greets to Black IC for his VESOFT write up 
and to The Underground Consortium for their Hewlet Packard support.
