ROLM PhoneMail - Revisited                      
by: khelbin 
email: khelbin@connix.com

This is a follow-up article in conjunction with Substance's article,
9X_RLMPM.ZIP on ROLM Phonemail systems (So please read 9X_RLMPM.ZIP first
or you'll jizz over outdial!).  This will basically show you the easiest 
way to set yourself up a VMB on these systems.  I do claim to be a good
"doc" writer so if you can't follow this, you have an IQ of 80 or less.

To remind you, this is what a ROLM Phonemail system usually looks like:


   CARRIER 1200

   ROLM PhoneMail 9252 9254 Microcode Version 5.2
   Copyright (C) ROLM Systems 1991
   All Rights Reserved.

   PM Login>

 
Older version of PhoneMail will drop you to a "Command %" prompt but for
the most part, use the previous description in identifying them.
 
Typing "?" at the PM Login prompt will show the valid login accounts.

   PM Login> ?
   Valid login modes are:
      SYSADMIN,
      TECH,
      POLL.
 
Possible defaults for these account follow: 

 PM Login         PM Password          
 --------         -----------
 SYSADMIN         SYSADMIN,FIELD,TECH,SYS,ADMIN,<ENTER>
 TECH             FIELD,TECH,SYS,ADMIN
 POLL             FIELD,POLL,TECH,SYS,ADMIN 

   PM Login>TECH
   PM Password>
   Invalid Password.
   PM Password>
   PM Action> (woo-hoo! ..you're in!)

Once logged in, you will most likely get a "PM Action>" prompt.  Typing "?"
displays the following:

   PM Action>?
                  The following commands are valid:
     Activate <session #>         - Activate the session
     Broadcast                    - Broadcast a message to all terminals
     Connect <subsystem> <node #> - Invoke the subsystem
     Terminate <session #>        - Terminate the session
     List                         - List all open sessions
     Logout                       - Terminate all sessions and log off.
     Login <login mode>           - Logout and login again.
     Display                      - Display sessions status on a site.
     TechView <on/off>            - Enable/Disable TechView training.

We first must connect to the subsystem which is where all commands are
invoked to control/monitor the voice mail system.  Type "connect":

   PM Action>connect
ÿÿÿ
   Screen 1 - SVI on Node 1  is now active.


You will now be brought to a "Node # - SVI>" prompt.  Typing "?" displays
the following.

   Node 1 - SVI>?

"Sa" is the System Administration utility.  This command can be passworded
(I've found two ROLM PhoneMail systems... one was passworded, one wasn't) 
and accounts such as POLL may not have access to this option.

This is usefull especially in this case because you want your mailbox to
blend in with the other.  In this case, you would want to set up a mailbox 
at box number 3[5678]XX instead of box 1111 or 9999.

The "list" action under system administator function profile, lists a users
profile in complete detail showing all settings with their specified mailbox.

This information can be used as a basis for your information if you're not
sure what to enter when adding your own profile.

Now, let's add our own profile (mailbox).  For this, we use the action "add"
under system administration function profile.


   Function:  profile
   Sat Jul  6, 1996  6:42 PM

   Action:  add

   Name (last first)   :  ROLM    
   Class Number        :  10
   Extension Number     [1]   3500
   Extension Number     [2]   
   PhoneMail Password  : (Default = ##########):  
   Group Name          : (Default = ):  
   Referral Extension  : (Default = 0):  
   PhoneMail Capability: (Default = 
            Accept Messages   Answer Phone  Do Message Alert
                 TRUE              TRUE              TRUE
     Enter T or F for each field):  
   Abbreviated Prompts?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Alt Greeting Active?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Software Mailbox    : (Default = FALSE):  
   Failed Acc Attempt  : (Default = 0):  

     If you wish to exit, type ";".
   First Field of Form:  
   Name (last first)   : (Previous = ROLM):  ;

   Done.
   Name (last first)   :  ;

   
Now we have our own mailbox at box #3500.  Let's take a closer look at the
steps involved.
   
   Name (last first)   :  ROLM    
   
Selecting a name.  Here, i chose "ROLM" as i thought the System Admin to be   
an idiot who would think it is a default box and not to mess with it.  A
regular name will blend in well with the others though.
   
   Class Number        :  10
   
Selecting a class number designates what class your mailbox is under.    
Certain classes have different options such as being able to have more
messages w/o being forced to delete them or having the dialout feature.
Check out the "ClassOfService" function.   
   
   Extension Number     [1]   3500
   
Enter a mailbox number you wish to have which is empty.   

   Extension Number     [2]   
   
If you want to set up more than one mailbox with the same profile.   

   PhoneMail Password  : (Default = ##########):  
   
Enter the password you would like to have.  It will not be echoed to 
the screen.

   Group Name          : (Default = ):  
   Referral Extension  : (Default = 0):  
   PhoneMail Capability: (Default = 
            Accept Messages   Answer Phone  Do Message Alert
                 TRUE              TRUE              TRUE
     Enter T or F for each field):  
   Abbreviated Prompts?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Alt Greeting Active?: (Default = FALSE):  
   Software Mailbox    : (Default = FALSE):  
   Failed Acc Attempt  : (Default = 0):  

Go with the defaults for a regular mailbox here.  They should be set up
correctly.
     
     If you wish to exit, type ";".
   First Field of Form:  
   Name (last first)   : (Previous = ROLM):  ;

   Done.
   Name (last first)   :  ;

Keep smacking ";" to exit.

Now let's verify that the profile was added.

Good.  You now have a VMB.
