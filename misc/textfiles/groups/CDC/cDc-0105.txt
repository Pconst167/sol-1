_______________________________________________________________________________


     This is a small compilation of some of the poems that I have written in
the last few months.  There are more then these, but these ones were
conveniently already typed.  Most of these poems are experiments that I have
done to help me relate to the real world.  Rememeber; art is lies, form is
evil, and most importantly of all, rhyming sucks.  Poetry is not haiku.  Poetry
is not dramatic monologue.  Poetry isn't Dada.  Poetry is not anything.  Poetry
is YOU as an individual.  The words on the page are not poetry until you
experience it for yourself.  Poetry is everywhere.  Poets who squabble over
form, style, rhyming, and other mechanics are pretentious fools who like to
hear themselves talk.  I do not apologize for anything in my poems, punctuation
is simply there as decoration as I don't care really where it is.

                "Beauty must be convulsive or it will not be at all"

-------------------

Hope fading fast
Destruction iminent
The global annihilation
We all want
In our private hearts
Is drawing near.
The time is up
We've got thirty minutes left
Say your prayers
To your respective gods
As for me
I embrace the sweetness of oblivion

-----------------------------

flowers.
float softly to the pondlike
grave,
An uncovered pit filled with water.
flowers
rest on the surface
a gloomy sentiment of rememberance
wasted on a fool
fool fool fool fool

---------------------------

Avarice in birds soars,
But men can not fly.
He wallows in greed,
like a pig eating feed.
Why must there be lust
for a green piece of paper?
They think sex is vulgar
yet thrive on seeing people bleed
what kind of culture is based on death
while shunning life.
SINKING IN THE MIRE OF OUR OWN STUPIDITY
The time is at hand
to start again
To destroy the past before it destroys the future
to stop the cycle of decay
Do not stand in the way, my friends
Or you will be destroyed like all the rest.

---------------------------

hell
isnt really that hot
its cracked up to be what its not
sure its a real pit
but the only flames are those in the hearths at night
hell can be quite cold
if you are up north
that isnt to say it doesnt get warm
it does
you dont have to search really hard for hell
it's right outside your front door

from my darling dead. A red blood rose coming from her head. It wasn't my fault
that she stabbed herself. I didn't believe she'd really do it. I still thank
her for that final flower flowing from her frame. Tra La La La La La ahhhhh.

                                 Good Evening


--------------------------

Traumatized
Desperate Gleam
Ripping open your skull
Tunneling in your brain.
Meandering Circumstance
Killer Decoy
The worms all dance
On their feast of man
The worms are crawling through
The plate glass venue of your brain
Your soul belongs to them
Where is your beloved now?
Why doesnt he save you?

Scream Twist
Taunt Wrist
Scream Taunt
Twist Wrist

Why?

--------------------

I was thinking "What can I do to illustrate the moment of illumination when
your adolescent consciousness turns into an adult one, and how can I fit power
tools into the picture"

--------------------

Fortunately screams DROWN you in pools of noise.
Gasping for silence only to gag on more.
There is no escape.
You are MINE.
Thrashing and Frothing,
In my deep brown eyes.
You are mine.
You are not in control,
living as a swan.
You are a puppet,
yet I am a pawn.
Slaving and slavering for your interest
Burning my flesh for one healing glance
from your powerful eyes
Melting and reforming
Internal blessing
you are mine
no.
I am YOURS

------------------

My love is like a rusty nail.
The bright crimson sweetness flows down its length
when it cleanly punctures the deperate heart.
Punctured and pure in the beginning
Time causes it to fester
leaving a rotting malignancy rotting through my heart.

-----------------

I am drawing a picture,
hunched over my drawing table-

My head implodes.
I am in the land of the gecko lizards.
They swarm around me and call me god.

I draw a picture of a dog.

----------------------------------

Your suicide was
The fashion statement of the year.
Everyone clamored to be like you.
Conformists to the end.
Ten million died before the trend changed
again.

-----------------------------------

The charcoal grey ruins of the small
town in southern california,
down a bit further then L.A.,
were full of broken memories.
Twisted and mangled corpses
lay on the ground, where the blast
sent them in their final moments.
I dare you to find any life here,
all you will see is decay.
A government test of a new terrorist weapon.
A nuke the size of a ball-point pen.
Small enough to fit in a pocket,
big enough to gut this town.
The town that was blown up to entertain the men
in the occult pentagon of Washington.

-------------------------------------

The secret behind closed doors.
Five floors of death, doom, and party supplies.
This store has everything
a young arayan could want.
Guns, bombs, blow up black men, and torture toys
only a Nazi could love.

--------------------------------------

I will traverse the lines that border insanity
If only to save your soul.
Insanity is reality
seen through a child's eye.

--------------------------------------

Metamorphosis
-------------

The open wound spits out a burst
of irridescent synasthetics,
with the mirthful destruction
that proceeds the creation 
of something new.

Laughing a perverse little tune, 
the cobalt-blue landscape
is plowed over by glowing, blood-red
plasma.

The molten life cools,
turning brownish-red 
like the color of blood
found on the scene of a day old accident.

The crusting flow crumbles from within.
A shape is formed,
the supple curvatures cause the crimson light to flow from them
like molten wax.
The pink form stretches like a rubber band,
and all is good.

---------------------------------

A corpselike pallor came over my face
When I saw you laying there,
The gash in your abdomen spewing blood,
I was ripped to shreds,
As if I had fallen into a combine.
At that instant I felt your pain.
My life ended on the day that you died.

----------------------------------

I've been inflicted with the disease.
It is not the one that shrivels your skin.
It is not the one that rots your bones.
It is not the one that makes your left hand fall off.
It is not the one that is spread by sexual contact.
I've been inflicted with the disease,
the one that comes from the flag.
God Bless America.
Yeah, right.

-----------------------------

Stop tearing me apart as if I were a plaything
for a 2 year old.
Stop fucking with my mind, like you do to all the others
Stop taking advantage of me you filthy worm.
Crawl back into your hole and drown.
I'm not fishing you out this time.

-----------------------------

There is no reason for the wholesale belief
in the existance of a being of higher order.
What good has there been that hasn't been done by ourselves?
What evil has there been that we haven't done by ourselves?
Thank you very much, Herr Jehovah, we're doing fine all by ourselves.

-----------------------------

Take Take Take Take
We all need to take from someone.
The world is not give and take.
There is only take.
We all need to take from someone.
There is only take.
Take from my pocket and call it a gift.
I'll take from your purse, and do the same.
We beg, we steal, we heist, we borrow. 
Every single one of us.
Anyone who tells you any different is a liar.
A true thief is one that won't admit his thievery.
These are the truths of the world,
so live with them
and take what you want, it's yours for the taking.

--------------------------------

Razorblade kisses
so sweet and so sour.
how true indeed is that which cuts and bleeds.
An honest wound , the gash that hurts
but feels good.

---------------------------------

I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the united states
of
america
and true to the
republic
for which it stands
one
nation
under
god
indivisible
with liberty and justice for those who can pay for it.

----------------------------------

I refuse to die for something I don't believe in
I don't believe in my government.
I don't believe in your government.
I don't believe in the corporations that really rule.
I will die for the things that matter.
I will die for my freedom to speak as I wish.
I will die for my girlfriend.
I will kill for my belongings
I will kill for my beliefs.
I will kill and I will die,
can't you see it in my eyes?

----------------------------------

Life is but a glimmer in the pool of twilight sewage.
A stick in a vat of shit.
Once in a while the stick comes to the surface,
but it mostly is towed under by the turbulent currents 
that race through our lives.
I'm drowning in a pool of rotting offal
that was dumped from the people up there.
If I can drag myself out I will kill them all.

-----------------------------------

I will hold you down.
I will tear you up.
I will spit you out.
I will take you in.
I will love you.
I will
I will
I will
I will help you live.

-----------------------------------

I was sitting under a table in an abandoned room,
not a light in the house.
Curled in the corner like an abused child.
Too many people,
too much hostility,
I have failed.
I lost face in a crowd of people.
I must get away before I tear myself apart.
Don't.
Touch.
Me.
I.
Am.
Unclean.

-----------------------------------

My nature isn't the green and yellow of the trees.
My nature is the bloody red that flows around in us all.
A young sapling chopped down before his time,
Roots still forming,
ready to engorge upon the earth.
Blood runs down the hill from the sapling boy,
forming a pool at the bottom.
The ducks wade through, coloring their webbed feet crimson.
A squirrel runs around the growing pool on its quest for a nut.
A dog laps at the puddle for a moment, taking his fill.
There is only the sounds of the birds 
performing their cheery little dirge.

-------------------------------------

Haiku:

Churning, Burning it.
Water buffalo sitting.
Rice paddies go grey.

Tell Thee Thine Weasel,
Wherefore art thou running to?
Away from thee man.

Wilting, Baking the
obnoxious fumes that come from
the steaming volcano.

Escape thee rowdy
Ramrod; Flee, into the still
nighttime forest, flee.

Ripe ( Into The Lake )
Spells of demonic charm wait
to prey upon you.

Waddle to the shore
my friend, don't allow them to
plant you like a tree.

Revolution sways the flow of the psychic energy flowing from
the inner beings that reside inside your head. 
Have lunch, lets do lunch, baby.
Tell me where you keep your money.
I'm dying to get away from it all.
I can't stop the twitching in my toes, they are
green green brown green
with some kind of rotting disorder.
Anarchist clubs, a contradiction in terms,
group together, yet another contradiction, and smash small animals with large
wet dogs.
Trained seals die in an auto accident,
they most certainly were drinking that ol Brazillian rotgut
since they were preserved without the help of Mr Undertaker
.......!!!STOP THIS SHIT!!!........
No , No I will not, you cannot stop these fingers that are typing through the
mystical man from beyond my forebrain.
Neural cortex, tasting like grey cheese spread on a bread of bloody skin.
Watch out for the bones y'all.
Head stompin' to that old time religion
Whitemeat skin
Chicken of the worshippers of the man down below.
Ho Ho Ho, Old Nick
Transfer the blame
maybe the shame of the wholloping will tickle
your memory.
Maybe not.

Kill or crunch, dive or bite the bullet.
Take me from this evil land
I need escape I need release
Release me!

Just For The Fun Of It
----------------------

The blue sky yawns,
as the twilight creatures sink back into their homes.
A peep of light, coming up from the horizon
producing a red-orange mist to form at its edges.
The yellow globe rises further into the sky ,
Burning up the mist easily.

"Roger , High command.  We've got a Defcon 2"
The crevice in the far away mountain yawns and
then closes it's maw,
leaving the world behind.

"Situation developing at an accelerated rate, Sir."
"Move it down to DefCon 1."
The planes are launched , the silos are awakened,
all is in readiness.

Children climbing from their wooly cocoons,
their parents drinking their coffee,
televisions turn on,
to spout some useless garbage.

"We interrupt this program for a special report.
The Department of Defense has just alerted us that 
the Soviet crisis has accelerated to DefCon 1"
Defcon 1
Defcon 1
Panic.
Get the children to the basement.
Stampede.
Get out of town.

"Sir, satelites see a launch."
"Get me the president."
"Yes Mr. President, we'll launch"
Sending word to the silos.
Defcon 0.
Nuclear war.

30 minutes left.
Highway is jammed.
Evacuation is useless.
Move out onto the lawn.
Watch it all end.

Star wars failed.
They're all coming in.
"At least we're locked up tight"
Planetary fireworks show.
Sure looked pretty on the satelite.

Time passes, and the dust settles.
One thousand years of recovery.
The world is new again.
A fuzzy little animal scurries behind a rock.

-----------------------------------------------------

The Running Days.
Innocence dies in the street.
A former friend lies on the road,
Blood streaming from his eyesockets.
Cleansing the pavement,
Washing away the sins.
With another sin.
Just turned nine years old,
He told the police what he saw.
Gangboys gouged his eyes out
And left him to die in the street.
The RUNNING DAYS ARE GONE.

---------------------------------------------------------

The twitching stops sometimes.
It always starts again.
I try to stop it, but it just keeps doing it.
I gnawed on my arm for a while,
Just to feel the blood flowing from me.
I have no mind for repeating myself.
Repeating myself. Repeating myself.
My doggie likes the taste of blood,
I must taste like a steak.

----------------------------------------------------------

The Beginning is the end,
The End is near.
Come over the river my friend,
Let's kill people until the end is here.
