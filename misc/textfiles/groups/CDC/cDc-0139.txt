     This file is dedicated to the late Jim Henson, a man who always managed to
entertain both children and adults.  He was best known as the creator of the
Muppets (R) and Sesame Street (R) and for giving life to such characters as
Kermit the Frog (R), Rowlf (R), Waldorf (R), Dr. Teeth (R) and Ernie (R).
Jim died on the morning of Wednesday, May 16, 1990 of a severe infection due to
an overlooked case of pneumonia.  Thanks for all the laughs, Jim....
 
                               --Racer X
                                 "It ain't easy bein' green."

He creeps down the hallway
Monobrow
Head like pineapple
Mind chock full o' vengeance
Body of foam
    He lurks
         and lurks
    and lurks
Dew forms 'tween his turtleneck and skin
He clenches two fists of animosity
He arrives at the door - a murderous courier
    and mutters to himself
         "This is it.
          I have to do it."
With
    a
        slow
                  sweep
His foot pushes the door
gently ajar
The soft hallway light frolics
across the face of his prey
The delicate orange sponge
covered only by a sheet
Innocence
The prowler contemplates
    and conceives
a multitude of homicidal acts
         in his already damaged brain
"How can I lynch this criminal?
I could play butcher and then play doctor
 Heh
    Heh
       Heh
I could just knife 'im a few hundred times
Poison, nah...
    I'll choke him
No
    Suffocation
    Asphyxiation
I'll cut his damn head off
Crucify him
    Crucify him for HIS sins
Electrocution.  Quick.  Painless.
Wait, I want the sucker to feel it.
I could burn the son of a bitch
Set his goddamned bed ablaze
Make him suffer
          Suffer
    Colombian necktie
I'll ring tears from his plastic eyes
Never sorry before
You'll be sorry now."
The nightstalker freezes
Orange eyelids expose unconscious eyes
Blurr blurr
Coned silhouette in doorway
The sleeper asks,
    "Who is it?
     ' Somebody there?"
A violent leap
Yellow meets orange in a clash
The life-burglar darts atop the sleeper
pinning him to the warm bed
Yellow foam hands squeeze into fists
    "Bert, what are you doing?!
     Are you crazy?!"
The hammers are raised
The killer reminisces his motives
"This is for everything you've ever done to me!"
POUND
"This is for the time you filled our apartment up with water
 because you left the bath running!"
STRIKE
"Remember my purple hand?
 Here's one for that!"
BEAT
"Remember when you played tag with an involuntary me?!
 Now you're it!"
WACK
"You're it!"
THWACK
"And this one's for Rubber-Ducky!"
SMACK
"I hate you!
 I hate you!
 I hate you!
 I hate you!"
Endless streak of death blows
Pulverization
Arms at work like piledrivers
Drive drive drive
Fists like anvils
Sponge to styrofoam noodles
Final blow
    "I'm sorry (sob).
     I had no idea (sob sob)."
"It's too damn late for apologies."
    "Please
     (gasp)
     stop this.
     I'll never bother you again."
Yellow digs deep into a polyester pocket
Paper clips surface

         A
   wild
             chain
       of
         paper-
                clips
    "What?  Your paper clip collection?"
Like lightning
The paper clips are yanked around the helpless puppet's neck
Gasps for breath
Choke choke choke
The wire digs holes in the orange neck
"I
    can't
           breathe."
Convulsion
Sudden peace
The body ends its hopeless struggle
The courier climbs down from the corpse
and watches
    and watches
         and watches
An open window
The sounds of a restless city rush in
with a flock of city birds
"My pigeons,
 My beautiful pigeons.
 You hate him as much as I do.
 He's all yours."
    Peck
    Peck
    Peck
Midnight snack
An audible siren
Slamming car doors
Knock
Knock
Knock
"Open up!  It's the police!"
The murderer
    h   e  s  i  t  a  t  e  s
Pushes the window
anxiously higher
l
 o
  o
   k
    s
     d
      o
       w
        n
and leaps
wondering
       just
         how
           the
            sleeper
              always
               managed
                   to
                     be
                      so
                       innocent
                             when
                               always
                                    guilty
