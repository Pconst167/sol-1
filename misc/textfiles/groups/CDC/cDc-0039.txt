                                U P S C A L E !

                                U P C H U C K !

                          M O T H E R F U C K E R S !


                     GET OUT OF MY WAY AND STAY OUT OF WAY!

        I'VE HAD IT UP THE ASS WITH YOU AND YOUR WORLD AND YOUR RULES
        WHICH APPLY TO ME BUT NOT TO YOU.  I'LL TAKE WHAT I NEED AND WANT
        IF YOU WON'T GIVE ME WHAT I NEED AND EARN.  ALL YOUR LIES AND SHIT
        AND POWER MOTIVATE ME IN ALL THE WAYS YOU WON'T LIKE - ALL THE
        LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE ME WANT TO BUY A GUN, AND ALL THE BIG
        THINGS THAT MAKE ME WANT TO USE IT.  YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME,
        AND YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU!  IF MY FINGER
        WAS ON THE BUTTON - AND THE BOMBS WERE AIMED AT YOU - I
        WOULDN'T HESITATE FOR A MINUTE.  BETTER YET, LET'S FORGET THE
        QUICK WAY AND SWING WITH RADIATION, DAD - EATING AT YOUR BODY
        AND YOUR FAMILY'S BODIES WITH ONLY THE COOLEST, MOST VILE
        CANCERS!  YEAH!  YOU WITH YOUR CONDESCENDING SMILES - EAT MY
        SHIT!  MOVE YOUR MERCEDES, MOVE YOUR BMW - I HAVE NO RESPECT
        FOR YOUR PROPERTY BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MY VERY
        EXISTENCE!  THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL RANT.  FUCK YOU, COMMIES!
        FUCK YOU, RACIST SWINE!  FUCK YOU, RONALD REAGAN!  FUCK YOU,
        PAT ROBERTSON!  FUCK YOU, NEW AGE CRETINS!  FUCK YOU,
        WHINING LIBERALS!  FUCK YOU, THIRD WORLD LEECHES!  FUCK YOU,
        JANE FONDA (AND I'LL EVEN USE MY OWN DICK)!  I'LL WIPE MY BUTT
        WITH ALL YOUR FLAGS!  I'LL DRAIN MY BLADDER ON YOUR BIBLE,
        YOUR KORAN, YOUR FUCKING MANIFESTOS!  BUT I'LL KEEP THE BILL
        OF RIGHTS AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!  TELL ME I'M FREE?  YEAH, I
        WILL BE FREE - OR ELSE.  THIS IS NOT AN ADOLESCENT RANT.  THIS IS
        THE ANGER AND FRUSTRATION OF TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF BEING
        PUSHED AROUND, BEING SHIT ON, WAITING FOR NOTHING.  I WANNA
        GO CRAZY!  SO DON'T TOUCH ME - DON'T FUCK WITH MY MIND OR
        MY LIFE.  I'LL LET YOU LIVE IF YOU LET ME LIVE.
        LIKE I SAID - AND THIS IS THE ONLY CONDITION:

                     GET OUT OF MY WAY AND STAY OUT OF MY WAY!

                            I HOPE YOU DIE REAL SOON.
