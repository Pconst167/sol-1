     In the Fall of 1992, NBC: DATELINE aired a show on computer hackers,
interviewing Erik Bloodaxe, Doc Holiday and a person named "Quentin."  Halfway
through the show, Quentin is shown with his back to the camera, text scrolling
across his screen.  DATELINE seemed oblivious: on closer inspection, Quentin
was displaying a file which listed various MIL and GOV sites which allegedly
had autopsies of extra-terrestrials on record, information about UFO crash
sites, amd detailed governmental research on alien beings.

     By December, that DATELINE episode had created quite a stir within the
hacker community.  Who was Quentin?  What file was he displaying?  Was this an
elaborate hoax, a joke which failed to gain the attention of NBC?  At HoHoCon
1992 in Houston, Bloodaxe and Holiday explained that the file did exist and the
information it contained was, in fact, true.  Lending some credence to the
story, well-placed sources indicated that the White House had requested a copy
of the episode from NBC.

     Bloodaxe and Holiday refused to name the people involved, but explained
that a relatively unknown group had formed to pursue a project they referred 
to variously as "Project ALF" and "Project Green Cheese," searching government 
computers for any evidence which might verify a UFO cover-up.  Apparently they
struck pay dirt.

     By the summer of 1993, at least one member of Project Green Cheese had
"disappeared."  White House aide Vincent Foster turned up dead after an
apparent suicide; among documents found in Foster's office possibly linking
President Clinton to a failed Arkansas Savings & Loan, a videotape was also
found: the DATELINE episode on hackers.

     Apparently buoyed by their success, the Green Cheese group began scanning
an unpublished prefix in the 202 NPA toward the end of the summer.  They were
surprised to learn that nearly every number in that prefix was answered by the
same authoritative voice asking, "Who is this?"  Not to be discouraged, the
group continued until they happened upon a lone DEC server.

     There they uncovered documentation suggesting covert action of a different
kind: a cover-up instigated by the three-letter agencies and NASA, perpetrated
upon the public with the unwitting aid of the media in the early 1970s,
beginning with the death of three astronauts.

     What follows is an excerpt of their discovery.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT CAPRICORN
----------  ------- ---------

     By 1965, NASA's public relations machine was in high gear, advertising
amazing (and non-existent) advances in American space technology and setting
an ambitious schedule for the Space Agency's top priority: a manned space
flight to the moon by the end of the decade.
     Despite the few successes NASA and the Air Force had  with rocketry,
in a memo to the President, dated 11/13/67, NASA reluctantly expressed some
doubt that a moon mission could be accomplished even by 1973.  The President
made it clear that the moon mission was, by now, more of a political mission
than one of science, and its success was of the utmost national priority.
World sentiment at the time favored the Russians, their flawless successes a
seeming vindication of the power and motivation of the Communist system.
Further, the President felt that a success could deflect attention from the
Vietnam war and re-invigorate public sentiment in the United States toward the
nation, the Administration, and the ingenuity of American technology.
     As a contingency for failure, CAPRICORN was instigated, its final
approval to be decided by the middle of the following year in a meeting
between the President, DIRNASA, DIRCIA, DIRNSA and attendant adjutants.  The
President summed CAPRICORN up in these words, "If we can't be heroes, we can
damn well act like heroes!"
     CAPRICORN's mission was a relatively simple one: covert deception of the
public and media, under the guidance of PSYOPS and PPYRUS; a manned moon
mission would be simulated and pre-recorded in a controlled environment, later
to be broadcast "live."
     By June of 1968, CAPRICORN was recommended and Presidential approval
given.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT CAPRICORN (cont'd)
----------  ------- ---------

     CAPRICORN was an unqualified success resulting in, among other things,
later congressional approval for a large appropriation of funds to further
NASA's successful research.


BACKGROUND, PROJECT UMENSCH
----------  ------- -------

     In February of 1963, DARPA gained oversight of an ancillary NASA research
project that began with the discovery of efficient micro-machines and light,
extraordinarily strong alloys.  These new discoveries implied the possibility
for advance along a relatively new field of science: cybernetics.  DARPA
reacted enthusiastically by forming project UMENSCH.
     Most information on UMENSCH, DARPA is unwilling to share.  But this much
is clear: under the direction of DARPA, NASA got the opportunity to test this
technology on a human subject with the crash of an experimental flying-wing in
1966.
     As his CLASSIFIED service record indicates for the years 1960 - 1965,
Lieutenant Colonel Virgil Grissom (see Air Force files for Grissom, Virgil I.,
USAF 563-87-2981; CI DL 118-26-9069) had an exemplary record as an Air Force
test pilot, including a stint as a U2 pilot during 1956-1959, performing
reconnaissance missions over Cuba and Southeastern China.  In fact, it was
Grissom's missions which confirmed the mass starvation of over 10 million
Manchurian Chinese in 1959.
     Grissom barely survived an XF-17 crash at Edwards Air Force Base,
September 17, 1966.  His right arm was badly crushed during an emergency
ejection shortly after take-off.
     DARPA offered Grissom a chance to regain the limb through risky, untried
technology: a cybernetically-enhanced prosthetic implant.  DARPA termed the
marriage of cybernetic implants with biology, BIONICs.
     The surgery was successful well beyond UMENSCH's projections; not only
did Grissom's BIONIC arm function as well as his original arm, but in
conjunction with a BIONICly enhanced upper skeleture, Virgil's right arm was
capable of lifting several hundred pounds and inflicting marked fatigue in
steel objects.
     DARPA's investment of technology and secrets in Virgil Grissom in effect
made Grissom UMENSCH property and necessarily privy to several sensitive
projects.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT UMENSCH (cont'd)
----------  ------- -------

     Colonel Grissom was an obvious astronaut candidate and by the following
year was training for GEMINI.  In fact, because of Grissom's access to a
project as sensitive as UMENSCH, Grissom was later tapped to aid in the
staging of CAPRICORN.


THE APOLLO LAUNCHPAD FIRE; GRISSOM, YOUNG, & WHITE
--- ------ --------- ----  -------  -----  - -----

     You're already well aware of the fire this July on the Apollo launchpad,
which reportedly killed astronauts Grissom, Young and White.
     What you are not aware of, however, is that Grissom managed, with the aid
of BIONICs, to escape the space capsule just before Young and White were
asphyxiated.  It is not clear why Grissom apparently made no attempt to rescue
his crew-mates or why he used the ensuing confusion to leave Canaveral.
     For whatever reason, Grissom is now a loose-cannon.  Despite a massive,
but low-key manhunt, the officially-dead ex-astronaut's whereabouts are
currently unknown, though we have reason to believe he may have made his way
to California or Texas.
     We suspect disillusion with the American space program -- CAPRICORN, in
particular -- may lead Grissom to go public and compromise UMENSCH and
CAPRICORN.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT DPULTRA
----------  ------- -------

       "The most convincing lie is the one that's half true..."
                       -- Samuel Butler

     DPULTRA is a damage-control project of utmost priority.  Its goal is to
desensitize the American public to the potential existence of a BIONIC-enabled
man and secondarily, any allegations concerning CAPRICORN, the ludicrous
portrayal of the first discrediting the second.
     PSYOPS' proposed project involves the production of a network television
show, produced in part with Company funds, Pro-US propagandizing, which will
lionize the American Intelligence Community and plant the seed in the public's
mind that projects like CAPRICORN and UMENSCH are impossible -- due to the
inherent silliness of the show's plotlines, week after week.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT DPULTRA (cont'd)
----------  ------- -------

     DPULTRA's success is directly related to the Nielsen ratings it can
garnish and to ensure its success, PSYOPS personnel will be involved in
writing the scripts.
     PSYOPS suggests peppering the show's plots with psychological archetypes
-- symbols from Jung's collective unconscious -- and possibly even subliminals
(if need be).  The story line will, nevertheless, be played straight but also
utterly implausibly.

     I would like to discuss DPULTRA further with you in person at our next
Monday-morning meeting.

PROJECT DPULTRA OUTLINE
------- ------- -------

     Following our meeting Monday, this is an update on DPULTRA.

     In keeping with our RMD objectives, we've begun working on ideas this
week.  Much progress, although finished scripts are probably a month or two
away, depending on the final series terms from American Broadcasting.
     We've settled on character names and sketches:


                              DRAMATIS PERSONAE

Dr. Rudy Wells,   An otherwise unremarkable man, the genius behind BIONICs
Oscar Goldman,    Director of a secret governmental intelligence agency, OSI
Steve Austin,     Astronaut/Test Pilot/OSI Agent; renowned as the
                        first Man on the Moon.  Similarity to the name
                        Sam Houston results from the necessity to attract
                        Texas viewers particularly (as well as Californians).


     Following is a list of show ideas for the first season, along with input
from the PSYOPS officers.  PSYOPS wants us to plant collective archetypes and
possibly subliminals in order to carve the show's subtext into the mind as
deep as possible, and to generate the largest market share possible.
     These psychological implants will be joined with or disguised under
ephemeral pop culture references, such as UFOs, Aztecs, Bigfoot, Cold Warrior,
Earthquakes, the mystique of the American Indian, and the paranormal.

During an OSI science investigation of the San Andreas fault in the wilderness
of Northern California, Steve encounters Big Foot.  Steve later learns that
Big Foot is the product of extra-terrestrial genetics and cybernetics, but his
purpose on Earth is never clarified.  In a later episode, Steve re-visits the
heavily forested area and initiates a friendship with Sasquatch, eventually
saving his life.

Venus Probe
-----------

An interplanetary probe (like the planned Viking probes) destined for Venus
slingshots through the alien atmosphere and returns to Earth.  Its computer
program doesn't realize that anything's wrong, so it begins its collection
routines.  Unfortunately, it has returned to our planet with an extremely
tough armor plating (resulting from a chemical reaction with Venus's
atmosphere) and it's zigzagging its way through Southern California.  It
possesses extraordinary collection equipment which in this environment are
effective weapons.  Anyone who gets near it is in great danger.  Eventually,
Austin and the California National Guard defeat the device by luring it into an
open pit filled with very caustic acid.

PROJECT DPULTRA OUTLINE (cont'd)
------- ------- -------

Amnesia
-------

As the result of a head injury, Steve is stricken with amnesia.  Consequently,
he forgets that he possesses BIONIC powers.  He ends up living out an alternate
possible life -- moves in with a woman and gets a job as a construction worker.
Everything is fine until Steve happens upon a woman and her child, pinned
inside a wrecked car.  He tears away the metal and extricates the people, who
are grateful but become frightened when they see wires sticking out of a tear
in his flannel shirt.  Eventually, OSI catches up to him before anything too
out of hand occurs, and Steve regains his memory by episode's end.

     If this show is a success in its first season, PSYOPS would like to
consider a spin-off involving a second BIONIC character.  The spin-off would
include:

                              ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS

Jamie Sommers,    Substitute teacher/ex-tennis pro; an unlikely OSI agent;
                        A love-interest for Steve, Jamie obtains her BIONICs
                        after a parachuting accident
Max the Dog,      Formerly a laboratory subject, horribly burnt in a fire;
                        Now BIONIC-enabled.  Psychologically traumatized, Max
                        goes berserk at the first sign of flame

Jamie Sommers
-------------

Jamie, a junior high school substitute teacher and ex-tennis pro, and Steve are
engaged to be married.  At this point, Jamie knows nothing of Steve's
involvement with OSI or his BIONIC abilities.  On a vacation parachuting trip,
Jamie is injured, paralyzed.  Steve pleads with Dr. Wells to restore her limbs
through BIONICs.  Wells accedes.  Except that Jamie has amnesia and has no idea
who Steve is.
     Jamie is instructed in her new BIONIC abilities, and begins to exercise
them, when her body rejects the BIONIC implants, physically and emotionally
traumatizing Jamie.  OSI eventually solves the implant rejection problem, but
Rudi cautions Steve that if he tells her of her past, it may induce the trauma
of the BIONIC rejection again.  Steve lives with the pain of knowing that Jamie
is his first love and that, for fear of her safety, can never tell her.

Aztec Warrior
----- -------

Investigating an abandoned WW II bunker along the California coast which seems
to be emitting powerful radio-frequencies, Jamie discovers that an ancient
Aztec pyramid lies below the bunker's foundation and is now accessible through
a hidden tunnel.  In the pyramid, Jamie is confronted with an 800-year-old
Aztec warrior bent on protecting the contents of the pyramid and repelling
intruders.  In an allusion to CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, extra-terrestrials are
receiving from the pyramid's beacon the electronic version of an invitation to
re-visit the planet.  Jamie learns, however, that chemicals seeded into the
atmosphere as part of a NASA project to end continental drought will ultimately
interfere with the propulsion system of the alien craft.  Fearing the
accidental destruction of the aliens will bring extra-terrestrial retaliation,
Jamie thwarts the Aztec guard and destroys the beacon.

TO:   Bill Brown, PP Deputy Chief

FROM: Thomas J. Kelley, Director, PPYRUS Section

SUBJ: DPULTRA


     Nearly two years into the project, I congratulate you on DPULTRA's
success; the show has consistently rated high in the Nielsens, topping
STARSKY & HUTCH and occasionally beating out M*A*S*H*.
     However, there seem to be several problems and the show requires a nearly
intolerable suspension of disbelief.  To wit:

      1.    Running at 60 mph, why don't the BIONIC Man's sneakers ever
            wear out?
      2.    Steve Austin never received a BIONIC heart, spine, respiratory
            system, musculature or skeleture.  How is it that his body
            doesn't collapse when he lifts objects that weigh tons?
      3.    Most of Steve's body seems to be metallic; how does he make
            it past airport metal detectors?
      4.    How can Steve's BIONICs defy principles of physics, like inertia?
      5.    Steve's BIONIC implants are nuclear-powered -- an energy source
            potentially capable of generating more heat than the sun.  How
            can Steve's BIONICs slow down and even fail when exposed to cold?
      6.    Steve Austin's BIONICs cost $6 million -- a sum that seems
            laughably inexpensive.  Why is the BIONIC Woman's pricetag
            Classified?
      7.    How can a world-famous, instantly recognizable astronaut make
            a "perfect undercover agent?"
      8.    A BIONIC dog?  What's next?  A BIONIC earthworm?  A BIONIC
            tarantula?
      9.    Jamie Sommers' cover includes continuing her vocation as a
            substitute teacher; how does she make time to be a secret agent?
      10.   Where do the Fembots come from?  Are they important to the show?
      11.   Re: The Venus Probe episode -- why is a probe whose purpose is
            to collect soil samples, heavily endowed with weapons?  How can
            that probe not realize it's not on Venus?  If it's armored enough
            to withstand the atmosphere of Venus, how was Steve able to
            destroy it in a pit of acid?  Why was it malevolent?
