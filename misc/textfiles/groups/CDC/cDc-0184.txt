  ...presents...              It Looked Back at Me

     Purloined Sirloin sat across the table from Micrometer Eyeball. 
Micrometer Eyeball didn't have that standard pair of eyes which you can finger
on most human beings, instead she had one large eye set in the center of her
forehead.

     Because it stuck out so far, it looked as if that eye would fall out at
any moment.  It twisted and turned in the light, the pupil dilated and looked
at him.  The muscles in her skull gripped that eye like a hand wears a glove.

     It didn't have an eyelid and that bothered him.  He could sit here and
talk to her, but that eye never shut.  It never blinked, it just stared through
him like cold steel moving through his hot belly.  A moist pink nerve was
visible near the back of the eye.  It pulsated with a steady rhythm.

     Twitching, moving, looking, always looking.  He tried to stare back, but
that eye was unmerciful.

     Without warning, Purloined Sirloin jumped up and tackled Micrometer
Eyeball.  Pushing her to the ground he sat on her.  He had one thigh on each
side of her chest.  Though she struggled and screamed in surprise, that eye
just keep looking and watching.

     It was as if that eye wasn't a part of her.

     It was then that he leaned over and began to chew on that eye.  His teeth
pierced it like a hard boiled egg.  Micrometer Eyeball screamed in pain as
blood began to dominate her face.

     The eye had the texture of Jello in his mouth, but the lens was chewy like
squid.  The eye was easy to get at because it couldn't protect itself with an
eyelid.

     Purloined Sirloin stood suddenly and washed down his meal with the rest of
his beer.

     Belch.
