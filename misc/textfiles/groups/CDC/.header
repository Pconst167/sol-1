<H1>Groups: The Cult of the Dead Cow</H1>
<P>
The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) rose in 1985, joining the sea of textfile
groups that dominated the BBS scene. The majority of files they came out
with in the beginning centered around anarchy, heavy metal, and odd 
stories. By sheer tenacity of will, they continue as a group to present
time, and therefore have lasted well over a decade. This makes them the
oldest surviving textfile group in existence.
<P>
With well over three hundred files in their library, cDc has left 
almost no textfile subject untouched. Besides the ubiquitous phreaking,
hacking, and anarchy files, members have written poetry, fiction,
music lyrics, erotica, and Scene news stories. By constantly reviewing
their membership rolls and taking on new members when older ones retire,
the group has stayed fresh and active as an entity.

<P>
Through the general slowdown of the early 1990's, cDc repositioned
itself as a brand name by dint of the addition of Skeeve/Deth Vegetable,
whose own media awareness (interviews on Dateline NBC and other outlets)
ensured that Cult of the Dead Cow would recieve press and recieve much
of it. cDc got into the business of clothing and stickers, and did a
remarkable job of preserving its own heritage even as the majority of
users moved from BBSs to the internet. Members of cDc are now routinely
contacted by media when the opinion of the "underground" is sought or
at least pursued.

<P>
In recent years the cDc has gained nationwide notoriety for its work with
security-checking programs (a further expansion of the brand name) such as
<B>Back Orifice</B>, which provides remote administration of Windows 95
and NT machines.
