_______________________________________________________________________________


     This is a really good album and, well, I decided to type the lyrics up.
Maybe you'll agree with me once you take a look.  On a vastly different
tangent, if you want the free poster that came with "Fresh Fruit For Rotting
Vegetables" or the lyric sheets to the "Holiday in Cambodia", "Too Drunk To
Fuck", or "Bleed For Me" singles, please write:

         Faulty Products 633 N. La Brea Suite A
         Hollywood, Ca. 90036

Also if you wish a copy of the 28 page luxodemented libretto that came with
this album send 75 cents to cover postage to the above address.

--GOVERNMENT FLU

We got a drug
We're gonna try it out on you
Won't make you die
It'll getcha just a little bit sick
(chorus)
Got a head cold
Got a chest cold
And it's three days old
(Goin' on forever)
Make you hazy
Make you lazy
Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days
And years
Barely got the time now
To stay on the job
Double up the dosage in your water supply
Make you even sicker 'til you're slippin' away
Getting all depressed
It's getting all your friends
You can't get up
For nothing that'll rock the boat

The Government Flu
The Government Flu
The Government Flu

Slip it abroad
Keep a-slowin' down the USSR
But meanwhile
We'll keep an eye
On what it's doin' to you

(chorus)
Got a head cold
Got a chest cold
And it's three days old
(Goin' on forever)
Make you hazy
Make you lazy
Drive you crazy
For days and days and days and days and days
And days and days and days and days and days
And days and days and days and days and days
and years

The Government Flu
The Government Flu
The Government Flu
Flew
Through
You


--TERMINAL PREPPIE

I go to college
That makes me so cool
I live in a dorm
And show off by the pool
I join the right clubs
Just to make an impression
I block out thinking
It won't get me ahead

My ambition in life
Is to look good on paper
All I want is a slot
In some big corporation

John Belushi's my hero
I lampoon and ape him
My news of the world
Comes from Sports Illustrated

I'm proud of my trophies
Like my empty beer cans
Stacked in rows up the wall
To impress all my friends

No, I'm not here to learn
I just want to get drunk
And major in business
And be taught how to fuck

Win!  Win!
I always play to win
Wanna fit in like a cog
In the faceless machine

(chorus)
I'm a terminal terminal terminal preppie
Terminal terminal terminal preppie
Terminal terminal terminal terminal
Terminal terminal terminal terminal

I want a wife with tits
Who just smiles all the time
In my centerfold world
Filled with Springsteen and wine

Some day I'll have power
Some day I'll have boats
A tract in some suburb
With Thanksgivings to host

(chorus)
I'm a terminal terminal terminal preppie
Terminal terminal terminal preppie
Terminal terminal terminal preppie


--TRUST YOUR MECHANIC

TV invents a disease
You think you have
So you buy our drugs
And soon you depend on them

Pain is in your mind
Gotcha comin' back for more
Again and again and again and again
Gonna rip you off
Rip you off

Doctor says you need surgery now
Feelin' good 'til the side effects
Fuck up something else
You're ensnared by the medicine man
Paying up the ass

Again and again
Gonna rip you off
Trust your mechanic to mend your car
Bring it in to his garage
He tightens and loosens a few spare parts
One thing's fixed, another falls apart
And the rich eat you

A magazine says your face don't look quite right
Unless you wear our brand new wonder cream tonight
Never look right again
Unless you grease your skin
Again and again and again and again
Gonna rip you off

Told you're depressed
So of course you see the psychiatrist
Right when you reach your neuroses' roots
He confuses you
He fucks your head up worse
Gotcha feelin' helpless
You're comin' back for more
Again and again
Gonna rip you off
Rip you off

Trust your mechanic
To make you well
You're seeing an awful lot of him now
The quicker he makes your life fall apart
The more money you put in his pockets

Trust your mechanic
To plug your holes
Trust him to make more
Somewhere else
Trust your mechanic
He'll always come through
And rip you off


--WELL PAID SCIENTIST

You're a well paid scientist
You only talk in facts
You know you're always right
'Cause you know how to prove it
Step by step
A PhD to show you're smart
With textbook formulas
But you're used up
Just like a factory hand

(chorus)
Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid
You're well trained
You're tied to a rack

Company cocktails - gotta go
Say the right thing
Don't fidget, jockey for position
Be polite
In the pyramid you hate
Sip that scotch
Get that raise
This ain't no party at all

(chorus)

Cringe and tense up
Grind your teeth
And wipe your sweaty palms
Close your windows driving past
The low life company bar
They're making fun of you

Ahhh
Even you
You've gotta punch the clock
Too scared to punch your boss
When will you crack
When will you crack
When will you crack
When will you open your eyes

Pull up to your sterile home
You're drained
Bite the heads off of your kids
Chew them well, they taste like you
Just slam the door
Assigned here cause your company owns the land
All your colleagues live here too
Private guards in golf carts
Keep you safe at home?

(chorus)
When will you crack
When will you crack
When will you crack
When will you crack

The dark shattered underbelly
Of the American dream
Avoid it like the plague
It stares you from the bathroom mirror
Drown


--BUZZBOMB

Buzzbomb buzzbomb
Macho-mobile
The road's my slave
That's how I feel

I cruise alone
I cruise real far
I don't love you
I love my car

'Cross Nevada
At 110
Highway 50
And there's nobody there
Sign says, "Next sign 30 miles"

I work all week, each penny saved
Buys more escape from my home
I'd rather cruise around all day
Than save up for a move

Plow through rest area san-o-lets
Splat! goes the lonely salesman
Wanking in the men's room

Buzzbomb buzzbomb
Tape up loud
Blue piss clinging to my windshield
Faster faster in my car

Buzzbomb is my pride and joy
King of the trailer court
Waiting for the perfect chick
Who'll love me for my car

I tell her why I'm cool
She coos back just what I like
When I pretend she's near

Zip through Ely
Where Pat Nixon was born
The cops 'round here sure looking bored
Flashing sirens - State Patrol

They're scratching up my gorgeous paint job
Shooting at my tires
Ain't no way to go to heaven
Buzzbomb cornered at the 7-11


--FOREST FIRE

No junk food, just earthly goods
I ate weird berries in the woods
Now I'm seeing colors, I'm getting higher
I think I'll start a forest fire

There's a forest fire climbin' the hill
Burnin' wealthy California homes
Better run run run run run
From the fire

But some of us stay and watch
And we think of your insurance cost
And we laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh
At your lives

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a fortress
Against the world

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a prison
How you gonna get out?

Electric bull and your tennis courts
Pink sports cars and your boat
Getting fried fried fried fried fried fried
By the fire

Windows covered by bars
Floodlights for the yard
It's a pleasure to watch you
Watch it all melt

But hey!
What about the cocaine
Stockpiled in the basement
Be a hero and save it
You know you're gonna need it

Where's your brand new pretty wife
She might still be inside
Either save her or your cocaine from the fire

But the gates and doors are locked
Cause the burglar alarms went off
Ever wonder why we laugh laugh
At your lives

Windows covered with bars
Fences spiked with barbed wire
Never looked so helpless
Engulfed in flames

Cameras watchin' the walls
Don't forget the dogs
Now you're trapped in your prison
How you gonna get out

See the gerbil
Run run run run run run run run
Run run run run run run run run
Run run run run run run run run
From the fire


--HALLOWEEN

So it's Halloween
And you feel like dancin'
And you feel like shinin'
And you feel like letting loose

Whatcha gonna be?
Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day

Better plan all week
Better plan all month
Better plan all year

You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that

I can see your eyes
I can see your brain
Baby nothing's changed
(repeat)

You're still hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween

You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months

Remember what I did
Remember what I was
Back on Halloween

But what's in between?
Where are your ideas?
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not everyday?
Are you so afraid
What will people say
(repeat)

After Halloween

Because your roll is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through
But what will your boss say to you

And what will your girlfriend say to you

And what will people out on the street they might glare at you
And whadya know?  You're pretty self-conscious too

So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations
And shove 'em up your ass


--WINNEBAGO WARRIOR

Roughin' it in the great outdoors
Guidebooks tell us where to go
Winnebego Warrior

Slow down traffic climbing hills
30 gallons to the mile
Honey, quick, the Polaroid

(chorus)
Winnebago Warrior
Brave as old John Wayne
Winnebago Warrior
A true yankee pioneer

Stop at Stuckey's for a meal
Blab all day on the CB
Winnebago Warrior

Littered campgrounds, folding chairs
Feed Doritos to the bears
Honey, quick, the Polaroid

(chorus)

Kill some fish down by the creek
Hang their picture by the sink
Show your grandson who's the boss

Tie your two tote-goats to the fronts
U-haul trailer full of souvenirs
That you buy along the way


-- RIOT

Rioting - the unbeatable high
Adrenaline shoots your nerves to the sky
Everyone knows this town is gonna blow
And it's all gonna blow right now...

Now you can smash all the windows that you want
All you need are some friends and a rock
Throwing a brick never felt so damn good
Smash some more glass
Scream with a laugh
And wallow with the crowd
Watch them kicking peoples' ass

But you get to the place
Where the real slavedrivers live
It's walled off by the riot squad
Aiming guns right at your head
So you turn right around
And play right into their hands
And set your own neighborhood
Burning to the ground instead

(chorus)
Riot - the unbeatable high
Riot - shoots your nerves to the sky
Riot - playing into their hands
Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast

Get your kicks in quick
They're callin' the National Guard
Now could be your only chance
To torch a police car

Climb the roof, kick the siren in
And jump and yelp for joy
Quickly - dive back in the crowd
Slip away, now don't get caught

Let's loot the spiffy Hi-Fi Store
Grab as much as you can hold
Pray your arms won't fall off
Here comes the owner with a gun

(chorus)

The barricades spring up from nowhere
Cops in helmets line the lines
Shotguns prod into your bellies
The trigger fingers want an excuse
Now

The raging mob has lost its nerve
There's more of us but who goes first
No one dares to cross the line
The cops know that they've won

It's all over but not quite
The pigs have just begun to fight
They club your heads, kick your teeth
Police can riot all they please

(chorus)

Tomorrow you're homeless
Tonight it's a blast


--BLEED FOR ME

You've been hanging 'round
With an enemy of the state
Come with me to the building
That no one stops to watch

(chorus)
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
C'mon bleed
Bleed for me

We'll strap you to a pipe
Electrodes on your balls
C'mon scream
C'mon writhe
Face down in a pool of piss

(chorus)

In the name of world peace
In the name of world profits
America pumps up our secret police
America wants fuel
To get it, it needs puppets
So what's ten million dead?
If it's keeping out the russians

We're well trained by the CIA
With Yankee tax money in Ft. Bragg
The Peace Corps builds us labor camps
When they think they're building schools

Hah

When cowboy Ronnie comes to town
Forks out his tongue at Human rights
Sit down enjoy our ethnic meal
Dine on some charbroiled nuns
Try a medal on...
Smile at the mirror as the cameras click
And make big business happy
Anytime
Anywhere
Maybe you'll just disappear

(chorus)


--I AM THE OWL

I am your plumber
No I never went away
I still bug your bedrooms
And pick up everything you say
It can be a boring job
To monitor all day your excess talk

I hear when you're drinking
And cheating on your lonely wife
I play tape recordings
Of you to my friends at night

We've got our girl in bed with you
You're on candid camera
We just un-elected you

(chorus)
I am the owl
I seek out the fowl
Wipe 'em away
Keep America free
For clean livin' folks like me

If you demonstrate
Against somebody we like
I'll slip on a wig
And see if I can start a riot
Transform you to an angry mob
All your leaders go to jail for my job

But we aren't the Russians
Political trials are taboo
We've got our secret
Ways of getting rid of you
Fill you full of LSD
Turn you loose on a freeway

(chorus)

Send you spinning
Send you spinning
Send you spinning all over the freeway
Spinning on the crowded freeway
Spinning on the freeway
Spinning on the freeway
Spin...
Spin...
Spin - Lookout

The Press, they never even cared
Why a youth leader walked into a speeding car
In ten years we'll leek the truth
By then it's only so much paper

Watergate hurt
But nothing really ever changed
A teeny bit quieter
But we still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play a lot of games
I am the owl

(chorus)


--DEAD END

Once I had a close friend
I knew him for quite a while
He seemed all right to me
We had this deal together
Tied up my money and time
And then he went away
Taking all that was mine

(chorus)
Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end

Once it was fun to worry
About who was in control
Could look into the future
But now it don't seem right
Passion is filling the air
Profits and better than life
And things are harder to beat

(chorus)

It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead end

Once I had a lover
I knew her for quite a while
She seemed all right to me
But then she was gone
She took my lovin' and my time
Taking all that was mine
And leaving me far behind

(chorus)

It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead end


--MOON OVER MARIN

The crowded future stings my eyes
I still find time to exercise
In uniform with two white stripes

Unlock my section of the sand
It's fenced off to the waters edge
I clamp a gas mask on my head

(chorus)

On my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight

Another tanker's hit the rocks
Abandoned to spill out its guts
The sand is laced with sticky glops

O'Shimmering moonlight sheen upon
The waves and water clogged with oil
White gassed steam up from the soil

(chorus)

I squash dead fish between my toes
Try not to step on any bones
I turn around and I go home

I slip back through my basement door
Switch off all that I own below
Dive in my scalding wooden tub

My own beach at night

Electric moonlight

There will always be a moon
Over Marin


Well that's all the tunes.  What now?  I think I'm gonna write some moo files.
