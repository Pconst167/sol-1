--AREN'T YOU HUNGRY

Sitting in my kitchen
Stuffed from having ate
What should I do now
With what's left on my plate

Maybe I should save it
But naw I got the cash
Think I'll take the easy way
And throw it in the trash

U.S.A. for Africa
What a fucking scam
Charity begins at home
What about our land
America has it's own problems
That's what should come first
So fuck those nigger's charity
And let them die of thirst

AREN'T YOU HUNGRY
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY

U.S.A. for U.S.A.
That's what I'd like to see
But sympathetic assholes
Send it all to their own countries
They want the food to grow
On what they call home land
But don't you know
You can't grow anything in sand

AREN'T YOU HUNGRY
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY
AREN'T YOU HUNGRY

I think of people starving
But do you think I care
Let them all die hungry
So I can breathe their air

Sitting in my kitchen
Stuffed form having ate
What should I do now
With what's left on my plate


--GET A REAL JOB

Standing on a corner
Frozen to the bone
You have to make a living
But you'd rather be at home
Your eyes start getting heavy
Still you forge on
Wake up and face the world

AND GET A REAL JOB
GET A REAL JOB

You get a little older
Your bones are brittle and weak
Dizzy in the morning
Your pulse is sounding weak
You hate to go to work
Just living for a job
Wake up and smell the coffee
And get a real job

GET A REAL JOB
GET A REAL JOB
GET A REAL JOB
GET A REAL JOB

Soon you will retire
Or maybe have a stroke
You cannot feel your finger tips
Because some veins have closed
But still you drive a hack
Or push a hotdog cart
Now it's too late for you
To get a real job


--I EXECUTIONER

I executioner
There's just me
You can't buy justice
And it sure ain't free
I executioner
Like Sargeant 'D'
I'm corporal punishment
I weed out the weak

I excecutioner
One on one
You and me
You've no place to run
I executioner
We got a date
My fist your face

How I love to hate

There's no justice
There's me
There's no justice
There's me

I executioner
You dare fuck with me
Say it to my face
Either way you'll bleed

I executioner
The king of schism
Misery and pain
Is what you'll live in


--DON'T FEED THE BEARS

You have to prove
That you're not scared
Enter the cage
Take the dare
Screaming death
In the beast's lair
You couldn't read the signs
DON'T FEED THE BEARS

Don't go in there
You best beware

Don't feed the bears

Stupid fool
You should have known
That's some place you shouldn't go
Polar giant on you
Blood starts to flow
They belong not in a cage
But in the fucking snow

Don't go in there
You best beware

And please don't feed the fucking bears!


--BALLAD OF DIO

In the dark of the day
Or the black of the sun
He's coming for you

Look out!


--THRASH OR BE THRASHED

I've seen enough
I just can't take it
Why don't you mosh
Or have an epileptic fit
You stand there like you're at a parade
Call this your scene
But you're the one who betrayed
Got your feet glued to the floor
Just there and thrashed some more

You're the fuckup, a dick to the extreme
It's people like you
Who make me want to scream

Thrash or be thrashed


--LET ME OUT

Aren't you sick of the way you're living
Let down in life without being forgiven
Struggle for a future
You try to survive
Put on this world to rot and die

Let me out

Let me out me out
Me out of this world
Tell me how I got here
Why don't you say a word

Let me out me out
Me out of this world
Tell me how I got here
Why don't you say a word


--BUBBLE BUTT

Bubble Butt
Bubble Butt
Bubble Butt
Bubble Butt
Bubble Butt
Bubble Butt
She's so fat
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble
Bubble Butt


--YOU'RE BEAT

Start up the car
You ain't going very far
Stick the rubber hose on the exhaust

Breathe that fresh air
It'll take away your cares
You're beat the game is over
And you've lost

Y.B........
You're beat
Before you start
You cry defeat

Sitting in the bathroom
With the razor at your wrist
You mom and dad don't like
The dudes you're hanging with
They say that you're a loser
A disgrace to human kind
If I were you I'd end it all
Before I lost my mind

Y.B......
You're beat
Before you start
You cry defeat


--BUSHWACKATEAS

Is that your hair or a Tina Turner wig
You should be ashamed of yourself
Now you shaved your head,
And that's a fashion too
With your ears you look like an elf
Bush-bush wackateas!


--MAN OF YOUR DREAMS

You thought he was dead
It was just in your head
You better get ready for Freddy

You thought you saw him die
But it's you who's crucified
So now you'll pay for his sins

He'll come while you sleep
You're gonna rest in peace
He's in the mirror hanging on the wall
He'll rip out your chest
Your body he'll molest
Then laugh and use your blood
To paint the walls

First he kils one
Then he kills two
Number three on his list is you!
He's the man of your dreams
He lives to hear you scream
That's his satisfaction guaranteed

You thought you'd escape
You felt that you were safe
Then you felt his blade
Around your neck
He'll dice up your throat
On your blood you'll choke
None of this Freedy Kreuger will regret


--CAPTAIN CRUNCH

Soggies suck

I was sitting up at night
I was feeling so uptight
I was just fucking around
There was something dragging me down

Thinking of a bite to eat
Thought this would be really neat
Cheerios are stale that's beat
But Captain Crunch is fun to eat

Captain Crunch, Captan Crunch
He's inviting you to munch
Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
Munch a bunch a munch a munch

Fuck my brain

Scoffing down this yellow wheat
Is making me feel kind of beat
My head is spinning round and round
Now my teeth are turning brown

My face is starting to come apart
From this overdose of starch
I really wish mom wasn't here
I'll have another box of beer

Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
He's inviting you to munch
Captain Crunch, Captain Crunch
Munch a bunch a munch a munch


--JIM GORDEN

Jim Gorden, the man who was insane
Jim Gorden, had Glaxo in his brain

Jim Gordon was insane
He took his mother's life
He used the hammer first
So she wouldn't feel the knife
He's gone insane
He's lost his mind

The voices in his head
Prove the bastard nuts
He bashed his mother's head in
Because she killed Paul Lynd

He couldn't play the drums
Cause people moved his hand
Was he just a mad man
We may never understand
He's gone insane
He's lost his mind

The voices in his head
Prove the bastard nuts
He bashed his mother's head in
Because she killed Paul Lynd

MOSH

Jim Gorden was insane
He took his mother's life
He used the hammer first
So she wouldn't feel the knife

He's gone insane, he's lost his mind
He couldn't play his drums
Cause people moved his hands
Was he just a mad man
We may never understand


--IMPORTED SOCIETY

They came from the other side
In bunches at a time
Crowding up the neighborhood
To raise the rates of crime

Some of them got money
Most of them got shit
All they do is come here
To take from our pockets

Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society

Don't you fucking see
That you bother me
Genocide
You can't hide

So go home now
Don't come back
Take your goat
Get on your boat
I hate imports
I don't want to hear their shit
I hate imports
Cause I'm just so sick of it

I just want to
Live my life without you fucking assholes
And I want to
Never see your ass again

Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society
Import, import, imported society

Hindus and Ethiopians
You know they're all the same
A huck a buck of Indians
They're all so fucking lame


--SPANDEX ENORMITY

Waiting here on line
Suddenly from behind
She's still a block away
Why'd it have to be today
Now what do I see
She recognizes me
She hugs and squeezes me
She's the Spandex Enormity

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from Hell to plague me with misery

What a fucking beast
Her ass alone would be a feast
And her love drippings
Contained a stench of rotted yeast
The show must go on
It's the end of me
Taking up the whole front row
It's the Spandex Enormity

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from hell to plague me with misery

As we were walking off stage
You're waiting to come back
She's got a back stage pass
Oh no
I hide my head
The sight of you I dread
Her chubby little fingers grab my ass
Don't talk to me, talk to Nick, talk to Nick
Why does it always have to be me
You fucking fat bitch
I've had enough of you
Take your blubber buns and leave
She left here in tears
Followed by her rear
I could not help she's fat

She's so sweet when she's yanking on my meat
Then she yells is this trick or treat
It's too late she asks me for a date
Before I'd fuck I'd rather masturbate
Spandex, Spandex Enormity
A beast sent from Hell to plague me with misery


--SHORT BUT SWEET

Short but Sweeeeet!  (wooo)


--PARENTS

Parents
They deprive
They diminsh our time

Mother-father
Wish I was dead
Could have been cum on their bed

Put me in this world
Gave me a little
The rich fucking bastards
Didn't care at all

Wish I were dead
I'm better off alone
I don't need their raggin'
Anymore

Turn that down
That noisy music
Go to bed
And leave me the fuck alone

That's all they say
And all they do
Get me out of this place
Can't take it anymore

Wish I were dead
I'm better off alone
I don't need their raggin'
Anymore


--A.I.D.S.

You're accused of the following charges
You're a woman trapped inside a man
Your sexuality no one denies you
But your preference we can't understand
You are the lonliness of all people

It's time for you to realize
AIDS like the plague is from God
For he sees something wrong in his eyes

Analy Inflicted Death Sentence
A.I.D.S.
Analy Inflicted Death Sentence
A.I.D.S.
Analy Inflicted Death Sentence
A.I.D.S.
Analy Inflicted Death Sentence
A.I.D.S.

That's what you get for having
A penis up your ass
You should have used a condom
That's what you get when you
Swallow another man's load
A lubricated condom

How do you find love in another man's hairy ass
You should have used a condom
Millions of lost hamsters
Running ramped in your bowels
Take the Hershey Highway

Fudge packing men
Fudge packing men
Fudge packing men
Fudge packing men
A manly man
Fudge packing men
Fudge packing men
Fudge packing men


--RUPTURED NUPTUALS

I bust my balls
I break my back
To come home to a slut
You broke your vows
You dirty bitch
I'll kick you in the cunt

Ruptured Nuptuals


--ODE TO HARRY

Harry got in his car
And turned the key
Started up and headed up the L.I.E.
Too cheap to get a real car
Had a Volkswagon Rabbit
And that put an end to Harry's cheap habit
Cause the trucker couldn't stop
So the driver just took aim
And when he hit Harry
Harry burst into flames
You're dead now Harry
And you can't come back
You'd still be alive if you drove a Cadillac


--HATE TANK

When you see it coming
The shit runs down your leg
A rumble of disaster
It's much too late to beg
You didn't heed its warning
As it's parked on top of your house
Your baby's crushed to pulp
You're cornered you cry out

The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank

Its treads are stained with blood
Of victims who had pride
Some thought they'd defy it
All of them have died
Destruction in its wake
The mangled corpses rot
If you think you'll survive...  NOT!

The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank

Here it comes, you better start running
Here it comes, you better start running

The armored shell coroded
From blood that now is dry
Markings left to signify
The deaths of many lives
Through many years of silence
Breaks a horrifying sound
You turn to look in disbelief
He's come to hunt you down

The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
The Hate Tank
Hate Taaaaaak!
