     Roscoe spent the week in bed, staring out the window.  How often had he
thought about the act before resorting to it?  It didn't matter now: what the
invalid said in that crowded theater had set him off and nothing short of
complete gratification was going to sway him from his course.

     On Thursday, Jane came by with a brown cardboard box tied with string.
Roscoe didn't open it in her presence, but he knew what was in there.
"It was my uncle's," she said, a little abashed.  "He was the Royal Hangman
until 1982.  I think that's when they stopped hanging people."

     Roscoe fitted the loop around his left shoulder and loosely draped the
remaining rope around his arm.  Part of the puzzle resolved.

     Now all he had to do was find the store.

 xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx

     There are literally hundreds of 7-11 Convenience Stores in Austin, Texas.
There is a city ordinance that keeps them spaced no closer than one and a half
miles, but aside from that small restriction, Southland Corp. went for
saturation bombing.

     Roscoe checked the 7-11 at MLK and Guadelupe first.  He bought a small
Slurpee.  The Slurpee Machine was a slow draw, and the drink was full of ice
chunks the size of beach sand on Galveston Island.  This wasn't the one.
Roscoe paid for his Slurpee and drank it on the way to 26th & Guadelupe.  Up
the drag.

     Sixteen Slurpee Machines, sixteen different qualities of Slurpee.  Watery.
Thick.  Syrupy.  Thin.  Broken (non-existent).  Variations on a theme.
Finally, on Burnett, he found it.  The Slurpee was perfect.  He had found the
adept.

     He paid for the Slurpee with a two dollar bill.  The adept working behind
the counter gave him a one-dollar bill and several trading cards featuring
prominent Rabbis.  He nodded to Roscoe, and Roscoe nodded back.  Another puzzle
piece.  He drank the Slurpee on the way back home.  It was a taste of Valhalla.
Perfect.
