        Pope Joan: Xcommunication
        Def Urban: Humanae Vitae


Sixtus VI: Pope 4 tha Nineties
Black Bull Press

1  6730   In Terra Libera
2  4200   Ecclesia Mundi
3  8120   Semper Vitae
4  2210   Non Fidelis
5  10330  Animalia
6  8900   Salvia Divinorum
7  2890   Non Fidelis (Il Purgatorio Remix)
8  5340   Ecclesia Mundi (Papal States Remix)

Comments: Hot young Pope Sixtus VI is already cutting sharp waves in British
chapels, and his second anthology "Pope 4 tha Nineties" shows us why.  Sixtus
VI's Latin is fluent, fluid, and melodic, and his rhetoric harder than anyone's
since John XXIII.  "In Terra Libera" rips straight off with a hard-hitting,
preachable case for freedom of worship; "Semper Vitae" is a smooth ambient
piece on medical technology; and "Salvia Divinorum" rocks the house down on
false prophets.  Topping the volume off are the hardcover-bonus remixes of "Non
Fidelis" and "Ecclesia Mundi," by German ultramontanist firebreather Luther
Zero, which by themselves would make "Pope 4 tha Nineties" well worth the
import price.

Summary: 10/10.  Sixtus VI brings the Bull home again.


Pope Joan: Xcommunication
Horns of the Cow

1  3440   Ex Communica  (Zwingli Is Dead Mix)
2  11890  Ex Communica  (Ras Tafari Mix)
3  1300   Ex Communica  (Fra Sahagun Mix)

Comments: This is Pope Joan's first release and if it's anything to go by we
have a lot to look forward to.  The angry young Dutchwoman takes a choppy
feminist rant and mixes it in with a healthy dose of expertly-applied samples,
everything from medieval Innocent IV bulls to 1930s Jamaican theology and
period reports on Aztec myth.  The mix is a little grungy in places but flows
thick and fast, and if you don't like one sentence you'll probably find
something in the next.  And the theology just plain burns.  This is one that'll
get the crowd lighting torches.

Summary: 9/10.  If it weren't for Horns of the Cow's lousy illumination and
layout this'd be a 10 too.  Imported and hard to find - but grab it if you see
it.


Def Urban: Humanae Vitae
Wurds of Wisdum

1  2790   Humanae Vitae (Trojan Reix)
3  7830   Humanae Vitae (Granada Remix)
4  18060  Humanae Vitae (Treaty of Tordesillas Remix)

Comments: Even at $4.99 domestic this Def Urban maxi-single is the absolute
worst waste of paper I've ever seen in my life.  If you've ever seen John
XXIII's original "Humanae Vitae," or think you might, in this life or any
other, DON'T under any circumstances come within spitting distance of Def
Urban's version.  Even with a million two-bit "Humanae Vitae" remixes floating
around, Def Urban stands out.  Abominable.  Sludgy, blurry printing, execrable
Latin, and lots and lots of stupid condom jokes.  Cardinal Ximenez himself
wouldn't have stooped to more than the first two thousand words of the
dragged-out awful pseudo-tribal "Treaty of Tordesillas Remix."  Def Urban are
neo-Inquisition at its worst.

Summary: 1/10.  The auto-da-fe's too good for them.
