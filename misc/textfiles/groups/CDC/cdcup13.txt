 _________________________________/Text Files\_________________________________

231: "Sunday Night Inside the Net" by Obscure Images.  Angstful Generation
X'ers angstfully analyze antisocial aspirations.  Analogies abound aplenty and
apply to arty asexuals and affected aardvarks.  Ah.

232: "Fred, the Boy Everyone Hated" by Allen Williams.  Fred the Third
Grader... pushed over the edge by the playground monitor.  Non-stop action!

233: "Desert Road Dick Disaster" by Lady Carolin and Renee O'Willsie.  This
file has to be a first of some sort.  Renee O'Willsie is Tequila Willy's little
sister.  Teamed up with cDc's only female member, Lady Carolin, the two go on a
castratin', whiskey-drinkin' rampage.  Fuckin' A, d00d(ette).

234: "Hybrid Vigor" by Curtis Yarvin.  Antonio the Badger-Man fought the laws
of genetics for his true love, but lost the brutal race against time... and
DEATH!!  Woah.

235: "Somethin'" by Franken Gibe.  More angstful action as day turns to night
and ain't nothin' gettin' clearer.

236: "Easy Rider II" by Erik Radmall.  A Harley-riding honey and a fat purple
dinosaur cruise into town.  Strangers.  Something's just BOUND to happen.

237: "The Fart of War" by Havok Halcyon.  A detailed story of one man's
gastronomical prowess.

238: "Clubbing" by Xibo (Mr. Coates).  Visit the biggest C&W club in Tuson for
a hootenanny.  It's introspective.

239: "Truckin' an' Fuckin'" by Omega.  Yeehaw!  White Knight the hard-drivin'
trucker goes for a swinging time with those zany wife swappers.

240: "Condors, Ganja, Rah Rah Rah!" by Clifton Royston and kEvin.  A new breed
of stoned super-condors swoop from the skies and attack the Rose Bowl-watching
sports enthusiasts!  It's obviously a plot.

     quality deal.  Roll hard with the phat cDc gear.  $15.00 plus a buck for
     postage.  An unsolicited quote from THE NIGHTSTALKER regarding his hat:
     "The hat is really spiffy, and I know it'll be getting me the respect and
