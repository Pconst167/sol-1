     Well, here it is...lyrics to 'tallica's long-awaited fourth album.  They
definitely haven't sold out to become more 'accessible', as this is probably
their darkest and most grim album yet.

     Note that "To Live is to Die" is sort of a tribute to the late Cliff
Burton, as the lyrics are by him and are chillingly fitting.

 Metallica is: James Hetfield - Rhythm Guitar/Vocals     Metallica Fan Club
               Lars Ulrich    - Drums                    P.O. Box 1347
               Kirk Hammett   - Lead Guitar              Roslyn Hts., NY
               Jason Newsted  - Bass                                   11577


                                  -S. Ratte'  9/6/88
                                   cDc - "And we'll remain the hardest ever..."

--BLACKENED  (6:40)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Newsted)

Blackened is the end
Winter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurity

Death of mother earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's End
Never will it mend

Never

   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened

Blistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have been

Callous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermore

Never

   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Color our world blackened

                   Blackened.

Opposition... Contradiction... Premonition... Compromise
Agitation... Violation... Mutilation... Planet dies

   Darkest color
   Blistered earth
   True death of life

Termination... Expiration... Cancellation... Human race
Expectation... Liberation... Population... Lay to waste

   See our mother
   Put to death
   See our mother die

Smoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappears

Darkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sun

Never

   Fire
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Blackened is the end
   To begin whipping dance of the dead
   Fire
   Is the outcome of hypocrisy
   Darkest potency
   In the exit of humanity
   Color our world blackened

                   Blackened.

--...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL  (9:44)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Halls of justice painted green
Money talking
Power wolves beset your door
Hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite
They devour
Hammer of justice crushes you
Overpower

   --CHORUS--
   The ultimate in vanity
   Exploiting their supremacy
   I can't believe the things you say
   I can't believe
   I can't believe the price you pay
   Nothing can save you
      Justice is lost
      Justice is raped
      Justice is gone
         Pulling your strings
      Justice is done
         Seeing no truth
         Winning is all
         Find it so grim
                 so true
                 so real

Apathy their stepping stone
So unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity
So deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns
Hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you
With prying minds

--CHORUS--

Lady justice has been raped
Truth assassin
Rolls of red tape seal your lips
Now you're done in
Their money tips her scales again
Make your deal
Just what is truth?  I cannot tell
Cannot feel

--CHORUS--

--EYE OF THE BEHOLDER  (6:25)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence

Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must

Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?

Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

   --CHORUS--
   Doesn't matter what you see
   Or into it what you read
   You can do it your own way
   If it's done just how I say
      Independence limited
      Freedom of choice
      Choice is made for you my friend
      Freedom of speech
      Speech is words that they will bend
      Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me

Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative

Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own

Do you trust what I trust?
Me, myself, and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

--CHORUS--

Do you know what I know?
Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself

Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thing
I hunger after independence, lengthen freedom's ring

--CHORUSx2--

--ONE  (7:24)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich)

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

   Hold my breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

   Hold me breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, wake me

   Now the world is gone, I'm just one
   Oh God, help me hold my breath as I wish for death
   Oh please God, help me

Darkness   Imprisoning me
           All that I see
           Absolute horror
           I cannot live
           I cannot die
           Trapped in myself
           Body my holding cell

Landmine   Has taken my sight
           Taken my speech
           Taken my hearing
           Taken my arms
           Taken my legs
           Taken my soul
           Left me with life in Hell

--THE SHORTEST STRAW  (6:35)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich)

Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witchhunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyes' disgrace
Defying common place
Unending paper chase
Unending

Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

   Shortest straw
   Challenge liberty
   Downed by law
   Life in infamy
   Rub you raw
   Witchhunt riding through
   Shortest straw
   The shortest straw has been pulled for you

   --CHORUS--
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Pulled for you
      Shortest straw
   Shortest straw has been pulled for you

The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
Your living catch-22
Deluding

A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be

   Shortest straw
   Challenge liberty
   Downed by law
   Live in infamy
   Rub you raw
   Witchhunt riding through
   Shortest straw
   This shortest straw has been pulled for you

--CHORUSx2--

Behind you, hands are tied
Your being, ostracized
Your hell is multiplied
Upending
The fallout has begun
Oppressive damage done
Your many turned to none
To nothing
You're reaching your nadir
Your will has disappeared
The lie is crystal clear
Defending
Channels red
One word said
Blacklisted
With vertigo make you dead

   Shortest straw
   Challenge liberty
   Downed by law
   Lie in infamy
   Rub you raw
   Witchhunt riding through
   Shortest straw
   The shortest straw has been pulled for you
                              Pulled for you

--HARVESTER OF SORROW  (5:42)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich)

My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fate

I give
You take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth

   Anger
   Misery
   You'll suffer unto me

      Harvester of sorrow
      Language of the mad
      Harvester of sorrow

Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to me
Get back which used to be

Drink up
Shoot in
Let the beatings begin

Distributor of pain
Your loss becomes my gain

   Anger
   Misery
   You'll suffer unto me

      Harvester of sorrow
      Language of the mad
      Harvester of sorrow

All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmares
To see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies

Infanticide

      Harvester of sorrow
      Language of the mad
      Harvester of sorrow
      Language of the mad
      Harvester of sorrow

--THE FRAYED ENDS OF SANITY  (7:40)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Never hunger
Never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

   --CHORUS--
   Old habits reappear
   Fighting the fear of fear
   Growing conspiracy
   Everyone's after me
   Frayed ends of sanity
   Hear them calling
   Hear them calling me

Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captor
Never warnings
Spreading its wings
As I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under

--CHORUS--

Into ruin 
I am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me

Height, Hell, time, haste, terror, tension
Life, death, want, waste, mass depression

--CHORUS--

--TO LIVE IS TO DIE  (9:48)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Burton)

When a man lies he murders
   Some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which
   Men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear
   To witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation
   Take me home


xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx

--DYERS EVE  (5:12)
  (Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett)

Dear Mother
Dear Father
What is this Hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in day out live my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

   Innocence
   Torn from me without your shelter
   Barred reality
   I'm living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still what's left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear mother
Dear father
You've clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
I've outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing I've always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

   Innocence
   Torn from me without your shelter
   Barred reality
   I'm living blindly
   I'm in Hell without you
   Cannot cope without you two
   Shocked at the world that I see
   Innocent victim, please rescue me

Dear mother
Dear father
Hidden in your world you've made for me
I'm seething 
I'm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this Hell you always knew
