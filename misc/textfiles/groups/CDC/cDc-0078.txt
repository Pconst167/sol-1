--TWIST OF CAIN

Ooh
I can feel it move me
Feel it shove me
As I break the law
Yea
I can feel its jabbing
Cuts the numbness then I
I come alive yea

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
    (Again)

Yea 
I took it standing
Broke commandments
And he tumbled like a toy
Blood
Like a crimson highway
Spreading out
From his forehead to the ground

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
    (Again)

Wo-oh
God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart
Wo-oh
Wanna know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below

Yea
I know my breeding
Know my father

He was born of light
Said yea
Can't hardly stand it
Splits me down the middle
Then I
Come alive yea
Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
    (Again)

Wo-oh
God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart
Wo-oh
Wanna know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below
    (Again)


--NOT OF THIS WORLD

Not of this world
And nothing bites like I do
Nothing screams out loud
In this empty night
Nothing can keep me from you

And you think that you know
The reason I'm alive
Truth is you only
Know the lies

Not of this world
And nothing can hold it back
I am the dawn upon your bloody beach
Come to pass

Not of this world
For I am nothing known
When the seasons shift
They call my name
To carry me home

And you think that you know
The reason I'm alive
Truth is you only know the lies
And I feel all the things
You could never understand
Choose where you stand
Am I mortal

Are you
Man


--SHE RIDES

She rides
Let loose the world
She is the night
And my loneliness in bondage
She's black
And sin runs down her back
She rides
From the daylight in chains

She rides the night
She rides the night

She slides
Down inside your skin
In time
She will make you scream
She's death

She rides
In the night of your mind

She rides the night
She rides the night

She'll take you down
She'll take you
She'll take you around
    (Again)

She rides
Let loose upon the world
She is the night
And my loneliness in bondage
She's black
And sin runs down her back
She rides 
From the daylight in chains

She rides the night
She rides the night
    (Chorus)


--SOUL ON FIRE

Angels fall to earth
World heats down
Cool

Now your heart is cold
Waiting on the summer
Of my soul

Devil-girl you must burn
Burn at the touch 
Of autumn's breath
Burn that heart of cold
Simmering in the samhain
Of my soul

Gotta wait
On the samhain of my soul
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire

Angels fall to earth
World heats down
Oh now your heart is cold
Waiting on the summer 
Of my soul

Gotta wait
On the samhain of my soul
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire

Come wrap my love in your house of ice
Melt you down more than once or twice
Make you shake till worlds align
See your body tremble w/blood on fire
Cause the season in my veins
Will end your world
To the season of the flame you must pray and learn
Change all the things that you've ever seen
Change all vision
Kill all endings


--AM I DEMON

Hordes of faces
Empty eyes
I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs
Offer up their flu
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you

Am I demon

You need to know

Faces of a million hells
Rage inside these veins
Pounding out deserved pain
To anyone in need
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for more
Am I demon
Need to know

Every world
And every limb
Torn asunder       base
Everything I need is me
Everything I am
Am I beast or
Am I human
Am I just like you
Power seething
Really reeling
Reaching out for you


--MOTHER

Mother
Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words
What they mean
What they say
Mother

Mother
Can you keep them in the dark for life
Can you hide them from the waiting world
Oh mother

Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh father

Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell w/me
I can show you what it's like
Till your bleeding

Mother
Tell your children not to hold my hand

Tell your children not to understand
Oh mother

Father
Do you wanna bang heads w/me
Do you wanna feel everything
Oh father

Not about to see your light
But if you wanna find hell w/me
I can show you what it's like 
Till your bleeding
    (Again)


--POSSESSION

I want to crawl inside your soul
Nestle in your brain
Stand you on your head
Crouch you on all fours

I will walk among your dreams
When you think you are asleep 
The invitation of your mind
Beckons me to your sin

All the things that you say and feel

For I will be inside your speech
Say the words you must not say
For I will lurk inside your heart
If you can take it and survive

As it must ever be
Oppression 
It's ever been
Through my oppressive black sleeping
It has always been
Possession
As it must always be

All the things that you say and feel

Become
Possession - riding
Possession - riding you hard
Possession - riding you on yea

And I will worm inside your skull
Make you beg to be my whore
Do my bidding day and night
If you can take it and survive

As it must ever be
Oppression
It's ever been 
Through my oppressive black sleeping
It has always been
Possession
As it must always be
    (Chorus)


--END OF TIME

The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled 
W/a hollow song
Got a new death
It lurks outside
Follows me home
Waiting for me

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea
Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea

A hum in the ear
Numbness comes
Feeling like you're almost home
The open arms
The tempting embrace
It's always been 
Waiting

The suffering's here
The wait is gone
The streets are filled
W/the hollow souls
Empty world
Of listless night
I pray to thee
I suffer blind

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too
Yea

Lost your soul
Doomed and cold
Yea


--THE HUNTER

Call me the hunter
That's my name
Pretty young thing like you
Is my only game
Don't use no love gun
Don't need no kissing
When I get ahold of you honey
Gonna light you up like Christmas
Ain't no use to run
Ain't no use to hide
Cause I've got you in the sights 
Of my
Burning

Call
Me deliverance
That's what I offer thee
Gonna do a million little things to you honey
Your life belongs to me
Don't use no love gun
Don't need no kissing
When I get ahold of you honey
Rip you up in pieces
Ain't no use to run
Ain't no use to hide
Cause I've got you in the grip
Of my
Endless desire


--EVIL THING

I serve my perdition
In this private hell
A thousand angers
Have kept me alive
Carve a hole in your distorted soul
I'm here to bang it

Yea
The blessing is a curse
Seduction and thirst
Feeds the hunger
That burns inside
Take a little caution
When you look my way
See the emptiness in my eyes
And the evil thing
That I bring
Soulless light

Warning is come upon your heels

Feel your dreams
Go away
Take a little caution
In the dead of night
Let the darkness rise again

Want the needing
Want to feel you near

Want you
Need you
Life
Want your, need your
Life
Feed it to me
