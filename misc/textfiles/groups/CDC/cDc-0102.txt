This file consists of lyrics from FUGAZI's demo and self-titled EP (Dischord
records).  The band is:

Joe Lally - bass

Guy Picciotto - vocals
Ian MacKaye - vocals and guitar

And now, a few words from FUGAZI:


--SONG NUMBER ONE

Song number one is not a fuck you song
I'll save that one for later on
You wanna know if there's something wrong?

It's nothing

Everybody's talking about their hometown scenes
And hurting people's feelings in their magazines
You want to know what it all means?

It's nothing

Fighting for a haircut?  Then grow your hair
Crying for the music?  I doubt you really care
Looking for an answer?  You can find it anywhere

It's nothing

Life is what you want it to be
So don't get tangled up trying to be free
And don't worry what the other people say

It's nothing


--FURNITURE

This is a song with no words
Nobody can here the missing
They just look at mouth and say,
"Hey man, I know where he's coming from"

Furniture has no say in life
It was made to be used by people
How many times have you felt like a bookshelf
Full of thought already written

This is a song with no words
I'm sure you've heard it before
You can see my mouth and you know that it's moving
You already know where I'm coming from

Right here


--TURN OFF YOUR GUNS

Turn off your guns
Don't cut your skin no more
Everybody's always saying,
If you hate life so much, what are you living for?
While we're still paying

You never hurt yourself
You hurt everybody else
And you talk about dying
But when your wish comes true, and there's no more you
We're still trying, we'll be trying

This is not the end of you

Noting in life could be that bad


--BREAK-IN

And he's happy because she's got skin
And she's happy just to let him in
When he asks will you let me in?
And from a place where they share skin they say

Come inside

And he's happy because she's got skin
And it's sweet when she lets him in, no sin
But there's a when where skin wears thin
And she finds she's working on another skin deep inside

Deep inside
Break-in

And then he wonders will my money, will it cover for me?
Can I stay outside and let it cover for me?
But she can't get outside, she's the covering
And she can't get outside, she's the covering


--AND THE SAME

At the risk of being too politically correct
This comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully change
Your way of thinking

That is if you believe in race
And that you were born in the right time and place
This is a thought, about face
Your way of thinking

And the same could be said
For all the people who are lying dead
To die was only distraction
What they found out a bit too late
Got twisted up in all that hate
And now it plays the part of reaction

If you have to carry a gun
To keep your seat at number one
This is a bullet you can't outrun
Your way of thinking

Just wait and see, it's coming round
Conscripted from the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound
Your way of thinking


--WORD

You got a problem?
What can you do?
What was that word again?

Life has got me down
Everything is wrong
Mom & Dad...(and so forth, whatever)
What was that word again?

The word is...

You see ugliness?
You see ugliness?
You see reflection.
Your reflection

What was that word again?
What was that word again?

The word is...

Change


--WAITING ROOM

I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait
My time is like water down a drain
Everybody's moving, everything is moving
Please don't leave me to remain

In the waiting room

I don't want the news
I'm not a part of it
I don't want the news
I have no use for it
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
Because...
They can't get up

But I don't sit by idly
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight for what I want to be
I won't make the same mistakes
Because I know how much time that wastes
Function is the key

In the waiting room


--BAD MOUTH

You can't be what you were
You have to be what you are
You can't be what you were
Time is now and it's running out
You can't be what you were
So you'd better start living the life
You've been singing about
You can't be what you were

No movement, no movement, no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind


--IN DEFENSE OF HUMANS

In defense of humans
Lay down your power trip
Stop toying with emotions
And relationships

You don't rise when people fall

In defense of humans
Lay down your politics
They're all big money
And media tricks

You don't rise when people fall

I see you ride this world
I see you rob this world
I see you rape this world
On off on off on off

And I don't like what I see

Greed

In defense of humans
Lay down your human pride
We're born into our bodies
No chance to decide

You don't rise when people fall

In defense of humans
Lay down your sticks and stones
Weapons and violence
Are better off left alone

You don't rise when people fall

--MERCHANDISE

When we have nothing left to give
There will be no reason for us to live
But when we have nothing left to lose
You'll have nothing left to use

We owe you nothing so
You have no control

Merchandise keeps us in line
Common sense says it's by design
What could the business men ever want more
Than to have us sucking in their stores?

We owe you nothing
You have no control

You are not what you own


--BULLDOG FRONT

Ahistorical--you think this shit just dropped
Right out of the sky
My analysis: it's time to harvest the
Crust from your eyes
To surge and refine, to rage and define
Ourselves
Against your line so sorry friend but
You must resign

You want to figure it out
We'll throw down, we'll throw down
You want to figure it out
Well throw down your bulldog front

Bold bold mouth talking not so bold
Now that you've eaten your own
Lips flecked, mouth specked you strip the
Skin right off of the bone

And I would never say you act without
Precision or care, but it's all attention
To armor, to the armor you wear so well
Let's knock and check to see
If there's somebody home


--BURNING

There's something acting on this body
Something goes in when nothing comes out
And someone's acting on this information
But nothing's registered from this location
From this site that I am, in asking
What is this buring in my eyes?

I wanted a language of my own
My lips sucked empty and I mouthed the lines
Of this crowd that surrounds me
Punctured and parceled I fold my hand
To this site that I snse that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?


--GIVE ME THE CURE

I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying

You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
that will never be found--like a reason
And I don't need a reason

I never thought too hard on dying before
I never thought on the dying
I never held the hand of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying

But you got to
Give me the shot
Give me the pill
Give me the cure
Now what you've done to my world


--SUGGESTION

Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body my only trait in the eyes of men?

I've got some skin
You want to look in

There lays no reward in what you discover
You spent yourself watching me suffer
Suffer your words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffere your interpretation of what it is to be a man

I've got some skin
You want to look in

She does nothing to deserve it
He only wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us

He just wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us

She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
But we are all guilty


--GLUE MAN

I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag

The sun comes up, the tide rolls out
The trucks roll by the park still a park
Where children play and pick up stones
Anything to make them feel less alone--he's alone

His mind is his own town where his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down

I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag

The sun comes down, the tide rolls back
We crawl our way back to the house we call home
he holds his home in the palm of his hand
And he says, and he says

You are my everyone, you are my anyone
You are my anytime, you are my everytime
You are my everywhere...anywhere...
