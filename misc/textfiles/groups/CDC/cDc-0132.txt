_______________________________________________________________________________


        In the abyss there is only one strength.  The power of the mind is of
little use here, the power of the body is even more useless.  The only strength
in the abyss is the knowledge that there is no strength.  Even the quantum
strands that hold us together are weak here.  The merging of lost souls is a
common occurrence.  Two strands become intertwined and meld into a single
strand over time.  Time is not a standard in the abyss.  Nobody is in a hurry.
There is nowhere to go and no way to get there in the abyss, at least until The
Wild One came along.

        The Wild One came from nowhere at no time.  The abyss was chaos as
usual.  The Wild One rejected the merging of souls.  It was itself, there would
be no intermingling of souls this time.  The easy chaotic sludge of the abyss
was shuddered at the defiance of this being.  The Wild One was order, an island
of sensibility in the ocean of irrationality.

        The chao-sludge began to coalesce into random pieces of order.  Tele-
phones appeared in the nothingness, only to melt away into a fern or a rock.
The Wild One was amused.  It happened like this all the time.  The islands of
order gravitated towards each other at great speeds.  When they came together,
they melded together in a white hot sphere of matter.  When all of the order
came together, The Wild One yawned and waited for the inevitable.

        The ball of matter exploded into the chaos, shoving it outward.  The
matter traveled away from the explosion, forming what is called "the universe."
The Wild One watched for the instant that was required to complete the process
of creation.  The Wild One gathered the pieces of itself that broke away in the
explosion and exited the abyss as it had come, looking for a new pocket of
chaos.

        As it left, the hands of time were set free.  It was the beginning of
the end.
