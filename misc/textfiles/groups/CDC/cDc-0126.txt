     As you well know, when you register I ask you to leave a little bit of
feedback, so that I will have a highly vague idea of what you are like.  I then
may or may not chat with you in a time soon following that.  Lately there has
been a person who has been very persistent in trying to gain access to the
system.  I would like to know what you all think of this individual based on
the feedback I have received (which follows after this message).

Note: text written in [ and ] are comments by myself.

(Some messages have been slightly edited - i.e. his phone number and real name
were edited out.)

     Well, you heard the guy, looks like this board is "g0in D0WN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
He, obviously, "knows wut hes doing!!!!!!!!!!!", we better be careful.
Actually, I don't think this board is "k-elite enph ph0r him!1!"..

-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-

EPILOGUE:  Stud muffin, depeche patr0l, never called back after his last
"threat."  I think this just goes to show how many real losers are out there;
don't encourage them--it makes me ill.
