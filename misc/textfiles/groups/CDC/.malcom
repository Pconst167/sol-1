# MALCOM -- The TinyTIM FTP Site Index.html Generator.
#           Written by Sketch the Cow, April, 1998.
#
# Malcom creates a file named index.html, adds the contents of
# .header, goes through .descs and generates a huge-ass table, then
# appends the contents of .footer at the end. Does it get easier than
# that? Don't think so.
#
# REQUIRED FILES:
#
# .malcom (This one)
# .malcomx (The table generator)
# .header (The header of the web page)
# .footer (The footer of the web page)
# .descs (A list of files and descriptions. Filenames MUST MATCH.)

sort .descs >.descs.tmp
mv .descs.tmp .descs

cat .header

sh .malcomx <.descs    
  
cat .footer
