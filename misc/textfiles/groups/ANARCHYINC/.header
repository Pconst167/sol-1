<H1>Groups: Anarchy Incorporated</H1>
<P>
Located around the San Jose, Califronia area and founded around 1984, Anarchy
Incorporated provided a steady stream of humorous and inside-joke-laden text
files for AE Lines and BBSes for well around 4 years. 
<P>
The combination of the technical expertise of the members and their shared 
deep interest in BBS Software (Waffle BBS was created by a member) ensured
that the files recieved a wide distribution among nationwide communities.
Many of the members have gone on to careers in companies like Netscape,
Apple, and Adobe, showing their abilities extended far beyond textfiles.
<P>
While some of the files
wander into treatises on vandalism and phreaking how-tos, the vast
majority of the work of Anarchy Inc. simply described fictional and
non-fictional accounts of happenings between the members, and writings
about the world that almost approach stream-of-consciousness. A sizeable
percentage of the files ridicule or lambast a fictional character named
Matt Ackeret who most certainly does not work at Apple Computer and who
doesn't really exist. Really.
