  Ghads.  I haven't called a bulliten board in about 1.75 weeks, and now, at
00:50:56 on July 3, 1987 (That's 12:50 AM) every board that I call is busy.  
All three of them.  Heh.  I used to be on a lot of boards, until by some rare
chance I found the number to [The Works!] advertised in a text-file.  That 
file was taken off of some small, witty operation of an AE somewhere in the 
mountain time region of the US.  It was jumbled up and most of it was 
unreadable, except for the first line, which said, "Call the Thieve's World
AE Line at 914-238-8195".  So I gave it a call, expecting to connect to an
Apple's AE, but instead I was connected with Jason Scott's board.   Since then
I've become a sysop of the board, made personal friends with a few callers, and
now call a whole other world of boards.  Namely, The Works, of course, and also
The Dark Side of the Moon (the number is <408>/245-SPAM.), which I don't even
call that often, even though Pink Floyd is one of my favorite groups.  And
the third and newest board is the Progressive Underground Dissidents, and you
can call it too at <313>/433-3164.  Before those boards, I called things like
Pirate-80 (which I had better call tommorow to see if Scan Man threw me off 
yet or not; I haven't been on in 2 months), Cygnus, Epson Citadel (my favorite
board since the day I called it in 1984.  All of the members were good
friends, and once a year we went to Geauga Lake [a local amusement park] and
occasionally went to movies, etc., but in late May the sysop got a Leading
Edge PC compat with everything, and sold his Epson.  So the board went down.
For a while all of us called each other and there was word of putting the
board up on the Leading Edge, but I doubt it will happen.  The sysop is 23 and
has his own life to live.  Most of the users are either going into college, out
of town for the summer, or are no longer interested in modeming.  And now 
none of the users talk to each other, either.  It's wierd, being that we were
such good friends while it was up.  That's one of the funny things about 
people.  I actually thought that we were all such good friends, but I can
see now that it doesn't really matter to anyone anymore (me included).  But
the memories are still there.    Where was I?  Oh, yeah, the other boards I 
used to call.  Well, there were a few phreak boards like Phreak Klass 2600
(I can't call it anymore because it's only 300 baud and I really don't have
the time for that), Ctrl-C's board, Phantasie Realm (I stopped calling that 
because I got _total_ line noise at 1200.  But I never had the time to call
Ctrl-C and tell him why I stopped calling.  I bet he hates me...), and 2600
Magazine's Private Sector.  I had called some local hack boards, namely 
The Underworld Elite //, Samhain, and The Wastelands, until last summer when
one was busted, one's computer broke, and the last one got tired of hacking.
Also, I called the 2300 Club boards until one member turned into a nark and
the rest of the Club split up, and King Blotto left for college.  There were
some other good boards (like No Bullsheet, and Med-Net ][+).
 
    I feel like I should start a new paragraph, since all of you are probably
terribly bored by now.  But I feel that I have to put this in a text file,
because any day now I might just drop out of computing forever.  My computer
broke last week and I just got it back from Basic Computer yesterday.  But
it's not my computer breaking that's making me think that I'm going to hang
up the phone forever, but it's that I'm changing (not, I'm NOT turning into
a werewolf), and I want to do a LOT more in my life, so I don't have time to
put all the dedication into computers.  Sure, I could call maybe once a week,
but then I wouldn't be the respected, intelligent user I was before, but I'd
be your typical "Blue Buccaneer" or "Peter Pirate".  Well, maybe not THAT bad,
but I wouldn't fit in right, and one day you'd see me, and then you'd never 
see me call that board again.  I'd be just another name on a boards "Last Five
Caller List".  And I don't want to bother if that's all that it'll do.  And
I surely don't have time for hacking anymore, but it's too bad, because right 
before I changed (jeesh, I'm making this sound like I had an operation or 
something) in May, I had found some serious shit, including bell unixes, the
Ohio Department of Motor Vehicle's number, and others.  But I simply
can't get into it, because I need my time.  And I just thought of something.
When the movie "WarGames" came out in 1983, I said, "W0w!  I want to be a 
c00l hacker, too11!!!".  And then I bought an IBM and a modem (a 300 baud
VolksModem.  Yech).  And when I called the "hack/phreak" boards, all of the
newcomers (including me) were laughed at and called "Members of the WarGames
Generation"... and some of those people had aliases like "The Game Doctor",
"Beaver Moken" and "The Formater" (spelled wrong), the first one was 14, the
second 15 and the third was 16 at the time.  But I looked up to them.  I had
just turned 13 and had a 2600 hertz voice.  And now I look back at how long
ago that was, and how much I've learned.  Heck, the only reason I bought my
modem and computer was in hopes to change my grades and find NORAD's 
defense computer, but now I use it so differently.  And half of the "phreaks"
out there today never even saw WarGames when it came out... that was the 
pre-Cyndi Lauper (girls just wanna have fun, funky synthesizers, valley girls,
and Bruce Springsteen) era.  At the time, the hit songs were "Let's Get
Physical", "Dirty Laundry", and "Pac Man Fever" (seriously).  Video arcades
were the big hit, and I remember one dance songs' lyrics as "you're living in
the shade of a video arcade".  Sheesh.  Things have really changed. 

   By the way, I forgot to put a header that the beginnning of the file!  Oh
well, I'm not going to bother going back and editing it, so... this is good
old "RAMBLE10.TXT", my third in this series.  I first wrote Ramble7, then
Ramble8.  Yep, it's me, --TeeSee.

   Well, I'll take a break in the action and call the PUD.  If it's busy, I'll
erase this line and continue.  If not, I'll chat with Mr. Pez, and that means
that I'll finish this file later.

Hmm.  It's now 7-3-87, 7:53 pm.  Last night I called PUD, but didn't chat with
Pez since it was 2 - 3 o'clock in the morning, and so he was asleep.  This is
all highly irrelevant to the file, however.  So I'll now continue.  Right now
WMMS (the station voted America's #1 rock-n-roll station for 8 years in a 
row) is playing the Firecracker 500 top songs in the history of rock-n-roll.
Right now they're at 400 something, which just happens to be "Love Walks In"
by Van Halen.  You can call the station, their number is <216>/578-1007.  

 "So when you sense a change
  nothing feels the same
  All your dreams are strange,
    Love comes walkin' in
  Some kind of alien
  Waits for the opening
  Them simply pulls a string, Love
  Comes walkin' in"

Whooa.  There's a bunch of dark clouds above.  It's gonna STORM.  It seems as
if every Fourth of July weekend it rains.  Oh well.  I'll continue a little 
later when I have something of importance to say.  And if I'm boring you, don't
worry.  It gets better.  Talk to you later.
