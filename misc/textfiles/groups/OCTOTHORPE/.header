<H1>Groups: Octothorpe Productions </H1>
<P>
After getting well over a thousand textfiles, The Works decided that it
should give back by creating a textfile writing group. Jason was fond of
the word "Octothorpe", which was the Bell System name for the pound 
button on a telephone keypad. Hence, Octothorpe Productions was born.
<P>
As the leader and maintainer of these files, I can give insight into the
experience of a typical textfile group. Unfortunately, most of my insight
is that I simply kept a special file upload area on the BBS open for my
friends to add files to. Some did, and many did not. The Cruiser took
it and ran with it, producing all sorts of files about the typical 
subjects a good group would cover, like phreaking and music. The Mathematician
kept donating fiction, and I buzzed in here and there with any and all writings
I came up with, branding them "Octothorpe Productions".
<P>
Octothorpe Productions lived with the first Works BBS, from 1986-1988.
