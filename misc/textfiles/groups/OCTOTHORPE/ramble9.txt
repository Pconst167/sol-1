 jimmy page /     that is, I am the third writer to      .:.:.:.:.:.:.    / /

 she / sometimes I don't know what I want to do with the rest of   / /
 me / my life.  but this is true for all of us, and thus, this    / /
 I / point is irrelevent.  if I cared, however, this would not   / /
  / be 'ramblings' but something like 'the silver ghost tells   / /
 / you how to be as studly as he is' or some such file. what   / /
/ I mean is that if it had a purpose, it would be named acc-  / /
\ ordingly. but instead it's just a bunch of ramblings, which \
 \ which would be done while I was drunk (to follow the great  \
\ \ tradition of earlier 'ramblings' files.  but it's 9:06 on a \
 \ \ thursday night, and I should be studying for my algebra ][  \
Q \ \ final tomorrow.  but fuck it - we all need to have a little \
ED \ \ irresponsibility in our lives.  (who the hell said THAT??)  \

of t \ \ hey! wait! school doesn't start until 9:30 tomorrow because \
his i \ \ of the aforementioned exams.  thus, I can stay up rather a  \
s wast \ \ lot later than I normally would.  last nite I was up until  \
ed spac \ \ 12:30 reading the new steven king (misery) and had to wake  \
e. there \ \ up abruptly at 6:47, and thus had to rush like a madman to  \
fore I wi \ \ catch my ride to school at 7:00.  I did it, but skimped on  \
ll now dra \ \ that very important hair care. speaking of which, my father \
w dumb litt  / told me my hair looked like shit yesterday.  it's kind of   / 
le things i / long, but not overly.  I wanted so much to say, "well, fuck /
n the spac / you!" but he would have gotten veryvery mad and perhaps hit / /
e for no  / me, and I didn't want to get into that.  but my hair must   / /
apparent / be cut, since it's so long it annoys even me.  I'll most    / /
reason. / likely go to "fred's barber shop" (yes, virginia, there     / /
hahaha / really is a place called "fred's barber shop", right here   / /
