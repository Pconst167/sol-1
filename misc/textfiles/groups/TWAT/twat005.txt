101 ways to subvert the infrastructre, lesson 1.

Pompus Pilots's Underground Guide to USENET(P.P.U.G.U)
		 By Pompus Pilot

Alright boys and girls, can you say NNTP? Thats the protcol that USENET runs 
on. Its very easy to access usenet through telneting to port 119. I have a 
file called Maas-info-nntp.  I am going to quote it in this article.  BTW if 
you see an address labeled as a NNTP server that means its a usenet server, 
and you should try to telnet to it at 119, public NNTP servers are hard to 
come by and if anyone has one that works and has a.b.p.e please leave 
voicemail at. 1800-241-7337 VMB:1371 Guest box:1111. The cool thing about 
public NNTP servers is if you have TIN or RN installed all you have to set 
NNTPSERVER = NNTP.SERVER.ADDRESS and run RTIN. it works really well


But there are alternatives, such as gopher to usenet servers. A good one is
usage.csd.unsw.oz.au port 4320. All you need to access them is a gopher 
client and the ability to telnet. just type gopher usage.csd.unsw.oz.au 4320.  
One advantage is with gopher you dont have nasty little .newsrc files telling 
which newsgroups you read. and if you combine it with unpost. (just archie 
for unpost.tar.Z). With unpost you just s each message out to a file and cat 
all the files into a big file and run unpost on it and will sort it out, they 
message dont even have to be in order or all together. I dont know how I got 
along with out it. IT even has a dos version.

Another cool service involving USENET is anonymous email usenet posting 
services. I am going to include a list of them along with instuctions on how 
to use them. One cool idea is to funky email(telnet anywhere at port 25 and 
fake it) a anonymous usenet poster and put it in non-anoymous mode. you make 
it look its coming from the person you want to fuck, then subscribe them to 
every huge mailing list you can manage. Some good ideas are the athruian 
legand mailing list, any binary mailing lists especially picture mailing 
lists and any alt.sex subgroup(especially something really perverse) email 
digest mailing list.  This will cause the the NET to bomb your target for you 
in a way that is almost impossible to be traced.   Nothing pisses off a
sysadmin more than someone who fills up there harddrive so full of smut that 
it crashes the system. It makes the person look bad and causes them serious 
problems, espeically if they get there internet email through a bbs/internet 
email gateway like the fidonet gateway, then every sysop along the chain from 
the gateway to the local bbs will be pissed. If it happens enough the local 
email node will be taken out of the mail network. It is a seroius attack on 
someone. Also you can funky email in their name on mist.test or alt.test with 
the subject test and in the body request everyone email who reads it reply, 
Alot of people will fall for it. Use the NET against it self, twist the 
infrastructure back onto its self. Whether or not you can make the system
do your bidding, instead of nibbling at its heels snatching bits of access 
and time slices, is the true test of real "hacker" (I hate to use this 
overusered and misunderstand typecast but I like to think in indealized terms). Its like using a chrome box so
you can go through any red light. oh well start the aformentioned files.

HERE is the email to usnet posting services they have anonymous and 
nonanoymous posting cabiilty.
begin now. (cut here)
********************************************************************
This message is being sent to you automatically in response to the
message you sent to usura@xs4all.nl with subject "remailer-help".

I have an automated mail handling program installed on my account
usura@xs4all.nl which will take any message with the proper headers
and automatically re-send it anonymously.  You can use this by
sending a message to usura@xs4all.nl, with the header Anon-To:
<address>, the address that you want to send anonymously to.  If you
can't add headers to your mail, you can place two colons on the
first line of your message, and then the Anon-To line.  Follow that
with a blank line, and then begin your message.  For Example:

> From: joe@site.com
> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The above would be delivered to beth@univ.edu anonymously.  All
headers in the original message are removed, with the exception of
the Subject (and Content-Type, if present).  She would not know that
it came from Joe, nor would she be able to reply to the message.
However, there are a few ways that the true identity of the sender
could be found.  First, if many anonymous messages were sent,
someone could compare the times that the messages were sent with the
times that 'joe' was logged in.  However, this can be prevented by
instructing the remailer to delay the message, by using the
Latent-Time header:

> From: joe@site.com
> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
> Latent-Time: +1:00
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

The message would be delayed one hour from when it is sent.  It is
also possible to create a random delay by adding an r to the time
(ie +1:00r), which would have the message be delivered at a random
time, but not more than an hour.  It is also possible to delay the
message until a specific time.  For example, "Latent-Time: 18:00"
would delay the message until 6 PM, Central European Time.  Times
must be in 24-hour format.

Another problem is that some mailers automatically insert a
signature file.  Of course, this usually contains the senders email
address, and so would reveal their identity.  The remailer software
can be instructed to remove a signature file with the header
"Cutmarks:".  Any line beginning with the same text at in the
cutmarks header, and any lines following it will be removed.

> From: sender@origin.com
> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: recipient@destination.com
> Cutmarks: --
>
> This line of text will be in the anonymous message.
> --
> This line of text will not be in the anonymous message.

This Cutmark feature can also be used to post a delivery notice
to a specified newsgroup. {ie. alt.anonymous.messages}]

> From: sender@origin.com
> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: MSG-id 1994.11.31
>
> ::
> Anon-Post-To: alt.anonymous.messages
> Cutmarks: *
>
> Message <1994.11.31> succesfully remailed
> *
> ::
> Anon-To: receiver@destination.com
> Cutmarks: --
>
> ##
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> Hi This is some anonymous mail
> This is in
> --
> This is out

If the first message shows up at misc.test you know that the message to
receiver@destination.com succesfully was remailed. 

For added security, you can encrypt your messages to the remailer
with PGP.  The remailer software will decrypt the message and send
it on.  Here is the remailer's public key:

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.3

mQCNAi4wTh8AAAEEAMb9gl6NlZHy4FdjADel4d+C+Th7+inTOV4mEsKk+N/QfJAj
BN6YPnJ9bm+Ch19FrR1KeTwrpluP6J+GdJrMkVSosvIqBPpSRgOs7nvMhnn3Tnrn

tC5HbG9iYWwgUmVtYWlsIFNlcnZpY2VzIEx0ZC4gPHVzdXJhQGhhY2t0aWMubmw+
=+iYx
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

To utilize this feature, create a message with two colons on the
first line, then the Anon-To line, then any other headers, such as
cutmarks or latency, then a blank line, and then the message.
Encrypt this with the remailer's public key.  Then send it to the
remailer, adding the header "Encrypted: PGP".  If you forget this,
the remailer won't know that it needs to be decrypted.

> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> From: me@mysite.org
>
> ::
> Encrypted: PGP
>
> -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
> Version: 2.3a
>

> =da+F
> -----END PGP MESSAGE-----

Any unencrypted text after the PGP message is also remailed.  This
is to allow sending to someone who is anonymous.  If you create a
PGP-encrypted message to yourself via my remailer, and then you give
it to someone, they can send you a message by sending the encrypted
message to the remailer.  The remailer will then decrypt it and send
it to you.  The message gets anonymized in the process, so the
sender will need to include a return address if he wants a reply.

You can use this remailer to anonymous post a message, the syntax
for that is:

> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: ignore
>
> ::
> Anon-Post-To: misc.test
>
> Test of anon message posting

You must specify a Subject, if no subject is specified the newsserver 
will reject the posting. Please donnot use the "Subject: test" if testing
to a test group [ie. misc.test] but use "Subject: ignore blabla" instead.
That will prevent my mailbox from being swamped with test replies, those
are send automaticly to -any- test posting with test in its Subject-line.

For non-anonymised postings the syntax is:

> To: usura@xs4all.nl
> Subject: ignore
>
> ::
> Post-To: misc.test
>
> Test

The remailer "understands" the following commands:
anonymous remailing : {Anon-To: ,Anon-Send-To: ,Request-Remailing-To: }
non-anon  remailing : {Send-To: }
anonymous posting   : {Anon-Post-To: }
anon-anon posting   : {Post-To: }
discard part of mail: {Cutmarks: }
time fideling       : {Latent-Time: }
PGP encryption      : {Encrypted: PGP}
Header Pasting      : {##}, {below that you add your header info}

You can get a list of statistics on remailer usage by sending mail
to usura@xs4all.nl with "Subject: remailer-stats"

This remailer is not endorsed in any way by XS4all Netwerk.  I,
Alex de Joode, take no responsibility for the content of posts or
messages, and I take no responsibility for the consequences of using
my remailer.  For example, if you post anonymously, and someone
manages to trace it back to you, I am not responsible.  Also, I have
no way of screening mail that goes through this remailer, so I am in
no way responsible for the content of posts or mail going through.
Also, note that this remailer is experimental.  Its mode of
operation is subject to change without notice.  Users are advised to
check these instructions and to do test messages often.

If someone is doing something inapropriate with this remailer,
please send mail to the remailer operator, as soon as possible.  The
problem can only be solved if the operator is aware of it.

If you don't want to receive anonymous mail, send me a message, and I 
will add your email address to the block list.

The Cypherpunks' remailers allow you to send anonymous mail by adding the
header Request-Remailing-To: and sending to one of the addresses listed below.
Most (but not all) of these remailers also accept Anon-To: in place of
Request-Remailing-To.  These headers must be typed exactly as you see them;
most remailers are case-sensitive.  Mail without these headers is either
rejected or delivered to the remailer administrators.  The standard
cypherpunks anonymous remailers are:

usura@hacktic.nl
hfinney@shell.portal.com
hal@alumni.caltech.edu
nowhere@bsu-cs.bsu.edu
remailer@chaos.bsu.edu
remailer@ds1.wu-wien.ac.at
remail@c2.org
remailer@ideath.goldenbear.com
remail@leri.edu
remailer@rebma.mn.org
remail@vox.hacktic.nl
remailer@desert.xs4all.nl
lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu

If you can not add the required headers, place two colons (::) on the very
first line of your message, then on the next line type Request-Remailing-To:
and the address you want to send anonymously to.  Skip a line, and then
begin your message.  Note that by using this method it is possible to send
a message consecutively thru more than one remailer.
Be sure to place the double colons on the first line of the message, and
skip one line following the headers.  Extra blank spaces (or forgetting to
seperate the headers and message) may cause problems.

Keep in mind that many remailers only allow one recipient per message.

You can add additional headers to your message by placing two number signs (##)
at the beginning of the first line of the message body, and then add the
special headers on subsequent lines.  The bsu remailers require that you
place the Subject: header in the body of the message, after the ##.  The
original subject line is removed.  (remail@vox.hacktic.nl does not support
this feature.)

remailer@soda.csua.berkeley.edu works slightly differently.  It includes
an encrypted reply block so that people can reply to your messages.  It
also requires that you use the header Anon-Send-To: to send anonymously,
and features a usenet posting service.  For more information on this
remailer, finger remailer@soda.csua.berkeley.edu, or send mail to that
address with the Subject: remailer-info

remail@extropia.wimsey.com requires that you public-key encrypt your
messages with PGP.  This added security prevents a hacker or nosey
sysadmin at your site from reading your outgoing mail or finding out where
it's going.  This remailer is not directly connected to the internet,
so messages will be delayed about an hour.
Some of the other remailers support PGP as well.
For remailers which support both encryption and plaintext messages, identify
encrypted messages by adding a header which reads:  Encrypted: PGP
Encryption keys can be found below.

The remailers at usura@hacktic.nl and lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu
offer several additional features.  Adding the header "Cutmarks:" will
truncate the message starting with any line that begins with the same
characters as in the Cutmarks header.  This can be used to remove an
automatically-inserted signature file.  Also supported is the header
"Latent-Time:".  This allows a message to be delayed at the remailer
and sent out at a later time.  This is useful because it prevents
people from correlating the times at which certain anonymous posts
appear with the times that you are logged in.  Both absolute and
relative delays are possible.  For example, "Latent-Time: 19:00"
would have the remailer hold the message until 7 PM local time and
then deliver it.  Times must be in 24-hour format.
"Latent-Time: +06:30" would deliver the message six hours and thirty
minutes after it is received.  The maximum permissible delay is 24
hours.  These lines may be placed either in the message headers,
or following the double colon.  For more information, send mail
to lmccarth@ducie.cs.umass.edu or usura@hacktic.nl, Subject: remailer-help

There is a pseudonym-based anonymous remailer at anon.penet.fi.  For
information on this remailer, send mail to: help@anon.penet.fi

There is another anonymous contact service at chop.ucsd.edu.
For information on this remailer, send mail to: acs-info@chop.ucsd.edu

vox.hacktic.nl also has a anonymous account service.  For more information,
send mail to remail@vox.hacktic.nl with subject "help".

Anonymous postings to usenet can be made by sending anonymous mail to one of
the following mail-to-usenet gateways:

group.name@demon.co.uk
group.name@news.demon.co.uk
group.name@bull.com
group.name@cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name@undergrad.math.uwaterloo.ca
group.name@charm.magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu
group.name@comlab.ox.ac.uk
group.name@nic.funet.fi
group.name@cs.dal.ca
group.name@ug.cs.dal.ca
group.name@paris.ics.uci.edu (removes headers)
group.name.usenet@decwrl.dec.com (Preserves all headers)

These were all verified as of August 1, but let me know if you have
problems with any of the usenet gates listed above.  Also tell me if
you know of any more of these.
The mail-to-news gateways do not anonymize messages; you must use a
remailer if you want the message to be posted anonymously.
It would also be advisable to try a post to alt.test before relying on any
such system to function as expected.  Also note the special syntax required
at dec.com

In addition, you can cross-post to several newsgroups by adding the header
Newsgroups: with the names of the groups you want to post to and sending it to
mail2news@demon.co.uk  (Use the ## feature with the remailers to add the
header line)

Examples:

Simple Remailing:
> From: joe@site.com
> To: remail@c2.org
> Subject: Anonymous Mail
>
> ::
> Anon-To: beth@univ.edu
>
> This is some anonymous mail.

Chaining remailers:
> From: sender@origin.com
> To: remailer@rebma.mn.org
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: remailer@ds1.wu-wien.ac.at
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: receipient@destination.com
>
> This is an anonymous message

Adding extra headers to the output message:
> From: suzie@euronet.co.uk
> To: remailer@chaos.bsu.edu
>
> ::
> Request-Remailing-To: mail2news@demon.co.uk
>
> ##
> Subject: Ignore this test
> Newsgroups: alt.test
> Comments: This is only a test
>
> This message will be posted to alt.test!

The operation of this system of remailers is a group effort which relies on
the contributions of many generous people.  Please do not abuse the remailers.
If you have problems with a remailer, most of the remailer operators can be
contacted by sending mail to the remailer's address without a remailing
request header.  Otherwise, follow the instructions that come in the messages
from the remailer.  Do not send complaints to postmaster at the site.
Most of the remailers are run by people who are not the site administrators.
Sending to postmaster or the site admins will most likely just make them
annoyed at you, and won't get your problem resolved.

If you can run an anonymous remailer, please volunteer to do so.
Software is availiable from anonymous-FTP at
soda.berkeley.edu in the directory /pub/cypherpunks/remailer/
Other remailer software is availiable at chaos.bsu.edu
in the directory /pub/cypherpunks/remailer/
Additional information and source code can be found at ftp cs.cmu.edu
in the directory /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr12/mg5n/public/remailer
or contact me and I'll send you what you need.
The software can often be run on personal accounts;
Root or sysadmin access is not required in most cases.

There are two usenet forums for discussion of anonymous remailer systems,
alt.privacy.anon-server and alt.anonymous
The newsgroup alt.anonymous.messages is a 'mail-drop' for anonymous parties
to exchange encrypted messages.

The cypherpunks mailing list is a forum for discussing ways to promote
privacy via cryptography.  To join, send mail to cypherpunks-request@toad.com

Additional information on the anonymous remailers is availiable from

%% NNTP, ONLINE MANUAL-TELNET ACCESS
 
It is assumed you have an account on an InterNet computer with direct
TCP/IP access, and that said computer has a TELNET user program that lets
you connect to other TCP/IP hosts, and that said TELNET program allows
you to select some port number other than the default TELNET port.
 
NNTP is a protocol described in RFC977 by which a NNTP server program is
accessible to a NNTP user program. The server program has an archive of
lots of articles from lots of UseNet newsgroups, and the user program
wants to obtain copies of some of those articles on behalf of one or more
users. But the commands that the user program sends to the server program
are in plain ASCII text and are quite simple, while the data sent from
the server program to the user program are plain text headers and
contents of articles. Consequently it's possible for a user without the
services of any program except barebones TELNET to pretend to be a user
program and connect to the server program, then to manually issue
commands exactly like a user program would have, then to read the text
coming back to decide which command to issue next.
 
First you need to know how to use TELNET at your host, and how to select
a host and port number. On many systems you simply type TELNET followed
by the name (or internet host number) of the host followed by the number
of the port. (Omit the port number to get the normal TELNET port; but for
NNTP you *must* specify the port number.) If your TELNET program uses a
different syntax, you'll have to ask somebody local to your system.
 
Next you need to know the name or internet host number of some host
providing NNTP service. At present I know of only one that is available
for general InterNet usage:
Name: uakari.primate.wisc.edu
Host number: 128.104.230.12
I know about two others available to the Stanford community (ask me
privately if you are on a Stanford host and want the info). The person
who told me about NNTP servers gave me a list of a few other hosts, but
most don't currently provide NNTP service, and the rest (listed below)
haven't worked for me:
--NAME--                --INTERNET HOST NUMBER--
uafvseg.uark.edu        130.184.64.203 - Some kind of networking problem, or the machine is down
uwm.edu                 129.89.2.1 - Some kind of networking problem, or the machine is down
sol.ctr.columbia.edu    128.59.64.40 - Probably a bug somewhere, perhaps on their machine
If you find that any of these actually work for you, please let me know
so I can change their status from bad to questionable. If you know of any
other NNTP servers, or how to get a complete list of them, please send
that info to the author.
 
Note that once you've become familar with using NNTP manually as detailed
below, presumably with the uakari server, you should try to find a server
closer to your location (unless of course you happen to be located in
Wisconsin). There is no index of NNTP servers, so you'll have to look at
headers of articles you browse and see if the point of origin happens to
be close to you. You can then check to see if that host has an NNTP
server, and if not you can contact the person who posted the article or
the Postmaster at that host to check if either of them know about other
UseNet hosts in the vicinity that might provide NNTP service.
 
Next you need to know the port number for NNTP service. It's 119. Thus to
connect to NNTP service at uakari.primate.wisc.edu, you say:
TELNET uakari.primate.wisc.edu 119
or if your host doesn't know that name, you say:
TELNET 128.104.230.12 119
or whatever the corresponding syntax is for the TELNET program you use.
 
Once you get connected, you need to select a newsgroup and then request
headers and/or bodies of messages. You may also want to have the server
print out a complete list of all newsgroups it knows about, but that is
more than 30,000 characters of text so beware!
 
To select a newsgroup, select a position (article number) within that
newsgroup, and look at headers and bodies of articles, you issue a
one-line command and then wait for the server to send you all the text
that results. The command lines always start with a keyword (command
name), whereas the replies always start with a numeric code then a text
message, then may have additional lines of text ending with a line
containing a single period. You may ignore the numeric reply codes unless
you want to understand the guts of the protocol or write an automated
browser.
 
Below are the most useful commands for browsing UseNet articles:
 
GROUP <NameOfGroup> -- Select a particular newsgroup, print out the Low
and High article numbers and an approximate count of articles, and set
the pointer to the first article of the group. If you now issue another
command (HEAD BODY or ARTICLE) without numeric argument, it uses the
first article. -- The very first command you issue may be rejected due to
a bug somewhere in the interface. If it says 500 Command unrecognized,
try exactly the same command a second time.
 
HEAD <NumberOfArticle> -- Move the pointer to the article (in the
previously-selected newsgroup) which has that number, and print out just
the header.
 
NEXT -- Move the pointer forward to the next more-recent article (in the
previously-selected newsgroup).
 
LAST -- Move the pointer backward to the next less-recent article (in the
previously-selected newsgroup). (Warning, LAST really means PREVious, so
don't get confused; don't blame me, I didn't write the command language.)
 
HEAD -- Without moving the pointer, print the header of the
currently-selected article.
 
BODY -- Without moving the pointer, print the body of the
currently-selected article.
 
By doing HEAD <NumberOfOldestArticle> then alternating NEXT and HEAD, you
can browse headers from oldest forward. Alternately by doing HEAD
<NumberOfNewestArticle> then alternating LAST and HEAD, you can browse
headers from newest backward. Either way, when you see an article you
want to see the body of, simply say BODY.
 
ARTICLE -- Without moving the pointer, print the whole (header & body) of
the currently-selected article. This may be useful if you're downloading
a whole set of articles without any prior selection. You alternate LAST
and ARTICLE, or NEXT and ARTICLE, to download articles in sequence
forward or backward in time.
 
LIST -- List *all* newsgroups the server knows about. As I said before,
this generates more than 30,000 characters of output, so beware! You will
want to do this only once in a very long while, and collect all the data
to a file which you then search locally from time to time.
 
HELP -- Print a list of available commands. Beware, don't use commands
like IHAVE or SLAVE that are supposed to be used for NNTP daemon programs
relaying articles, or POST that are supposed to be used for user-programs
posting new articles, since they are too dangerous to be used manually.
When in doubt, consult the RFC977 and avoiding anything that modifies the
state of the server in any way other than selecting your newsgroup and
article pointer. Probably you won't need any commands except the ones I
listed above.

%% NNTP-RELATED, NEWSGROUP POSTING VIA EMAIL
 
How to post from InterNet to UseNet newsgroups: Each newsgroup's name
consists of words separated by periods, for example 'comp.lang.lisp'. To
post, change each period to a hyphen, for example 'comp-lang-lisp', and
mail to that mailbox on 'ucbvax.berkeley.edu'. For example, to post on
'comp.lang.lisp', send email to 'comp-lang-lisp@ucbvax.berkeley.edu'.
(The apostrophes are for quoting and are not included in the strings.)
 
 
%% NNTP, Related topics:
 
MaasInfo.TopIndex -- This "Index of Indexes" tells how to 
get the index of RFCs and a few specific RFCs, 
and where you can find at least
two indexes of public-access UseNet hosts with NetNews.
