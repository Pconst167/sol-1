                AS REVEALED BY DIVINE INSPIRATION
                  THE WORD OF THE GREAT BANANA
                ---------------------------------


Hear Ye, Hear Ye...

Let it be known amongst the populace the our Divine Lord the
Great Banana has spoken to us.


"And ye, verily, thou shalt makeith a church of mine upon the
earth, and it shall be called The First Church of the Born
Again Banana.  My corporeal representative in all matters
shall be El Presidente, and he shall be hence forth called
Pope Inclement Drinking Weather the First."


In direct accordance with our Lord the Great Banana's wishes
I have hereby founded The First Church of the Born Again
Banana, and declared myself Pope.  The Great Banana, acting
through his earthly representative (me) has demanded that a
priesthood be formed, headed by a Cardinal, and this Cardinal
shall be named Cardinal Nana.  Bat Bastard has been chosen
for this ministry and shall henceforth be known as Cardinal
Nana.

Hear Ye, Hear Ye...

All ye worshipers of Bananas let us come together, to worship
the Great Banana in accordance with his divine wishes.

All ye followers of the Great Banana who wish to participate
in the worship of our Lord, should make yourselves known to
us, and we will enlighten you in the ways of the Great
Banana.
