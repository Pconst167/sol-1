
           AN ODE TO THE BR

     BY THE GREAT RABBI BAJZHEET


Shall I compare thee to raw porridge?
 
Hey, ther's an idea: Ode to BR
 
Shall I compare thee to Infoboard?
Thou art more kinky and less temperate.
Rough winds do shake the coconuts of May
And summer's lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too loud the line of telecom growls
And seldom is his foul complexion dimm'd
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance, or hacker's course untrimm'd
But thy eternal users shall not fade
Nor lost possesion of the files thou ow'st
Nor shall Fidonet bragst thou wanderst in its nodes
When in eternal lines to time thou growst.
 
For as long as fingers can type, or eyes can see
So long lives this, and this is a prety bad ending.
 
Worthy yeoman, canst thou dig it!
