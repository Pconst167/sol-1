                        An Interview with El Presidente
                        -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Reporter: Good evening LP.
LP:       Good (hick) evening.

Reporter: Is it true that you have imported a special  squad  of  Ecuadorean
          bananas to join the Te Atatu South Banana Party on your behalf, on
          the  understanding  that  if  they voted  for  you in the upcoming
          elections they would recieve special treatment  when  it  came  to
          applying  for  immigration  visas  and housing?
LP:       No....shhhnot true...honesht!

Reporter: But we have reports of 4-week  old  bananas  being  signed  up  to
          Banana  Party  membership by their parents, and reports of bananas
          who were listed as Banana Party members who didn't even know  they
          were members.  Is this true?
LP:       gluglugluglugluglug...swish

Reporter: Er...yes.  Well what do you think of these rumours?
LP:       Bleeeuuurrgghhhh!!!!!

Reporter: I  see.   And  is  the  rumour of legal action against yourself by
          members of the right-wing Banana-bone Club faction of  the  Banana
          Party true?

LP:       Barri?  Where'sh Barri? arrgghh..oh, there-ee-ish.  Hi Barri.

Reporter: Thankyou for appearing in this interview.
LP:       aaauuuhhhh...(clunk).

Voiceover: And that was the situation as of late last night.   Further  news
           as  it  comes  to  hand.   And  in our next news item, a shocking
           expose on the blowing up of letterboxes in  the  Te  Atatu  South
           electorate. Who is responsible?  More news after this break.....
