INTRODUCTION:  Freedom is not free.  We are in search of truth and freedom.
               The truth is out there.  Damage, INC. intends to find it and
               share our findings with you.  As the new millennium rapidly
               approaches, many controversial topics are being brought to the
               forefront.  The Damage, INC. Newsletter will openly discuss
               topics such as Cloning, the Apocalypse, the New World Order
               etc.  We will voice our opinions strongly and keep you informed
               about the major events that occur.  My own prediction is that
               in the new era, an information explosion is inevitable.  We are
               literally entering a Brave New World, in which there will be
               many great changes.  In order to be prepared, you must first
               become informed.  The word "ignorance" is derived from the word
               "ignore".  To blindly ignore the changes that are going to take
               place would be ignorant.  If you wish to perceive that as being
               a warning, so be it.

               Privacy is also a very important issue.  Big Brother is running
               rampant and gaining strength.  They seek control and yet cannot
               control themselves.  They're already too powerful in my opinion.
               However, Big Brother can be stopped.  Information can be used
               against them and dedicated freedom fighters can still attack
               them with intelligence.  Bashing Big Brother and revealing their
               corrupt ways is one of the most satisfying endeavours for me.
               I enjoy revealing their ways and teaching people how to be
               anonymous and retain their privacy.  That's especially important
               during these twisted times, when private is considered to be
               public information.  Of course, the result is that Big Brother
               is thriving and loving every fucking minute of it.

               The main message that I want to convey in this February issue of
               the Damage, INC. Newsletter is that freedom is not free.  Freedom
               isn't just given, it has to be fought for.  Free your mind and
               your body will follow.  This world can use more free thinkers.


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Big Brother wants our DNA.

To Big Brother, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is much more than a scientific
wonder, the beginning of all life on Earth... it is one more step towards
total control.  When Big Brother obtains the DNA pattern of an individual, he
has the blueprints to that individual's body.  Big Brother has been working hard
to bring human DNA banks into existence.  Big Bro's goal is to store the DNA
patterns of every person in "society" via blood samples, tissue samples, hair
follicles, etc. so it can be used against "dissidents."

When Big Brother can claim ownership of a portion of a human being, it only
proves how much we have truly lost.  How would you like it if you weren't
able to obtain a loan, or health insurance because Big Brother analyzed your DNA
sample, and found that you are prone to a disease?  Do you feel it would be
fair for the "genetically superior" to have an unfair advantage when it comes
to employment?  These scenarios are the future.  How about the police force
taking DNA samples from the bank and planting them at the scene of a crime?
Again, another plausible scenario since desperate cops can perform corruptly
when their backs are against the wall.  If they assume a suspect is guilty, and
have tissue samples within their reach, why wouldn't they use them to prove
their case?

Many states have already created DNA banks of all prisoners within their
particular "department of corrections."  As expected, the cops are extremely
excited over the whole idea of DNA banks.  To quote a cop, "This is something
that is more unique than fingerprints," said Nebraska State Patrol Capt. Kevin
Stuckenholtz.  "You put the sample in a computer data bank, and then if a crime
is committed years later and there is some forensic evidence that they are able
to collect, police can cross check to see if they have a perpetrator."  This is
another example how Big Brother uses the threat of crime to influence zombies
into willingly and happily support every law and policy that destroys our
civil rights and privacy.  Those that wish not to give Big Brother DNA samples
are treated like convicts.

During 1997, two American marines were court-martialled after refusing to
"donate" DNA samples to the Pentagon's DNA bank.  Corporal Joseph Vlacovsky and
Lance Corporal John Mayfield filed a class-action suit to force the Pentagon to
stop this practice, because it is nothing more than unlawful search and seizure.

The Pentagon responded by saying that they only want the DNA of every present
and former employee in order to create a "DNA dog tag."  For example, if a
soldier is blown apart in combat, the Pentagon would obtain a DNA sample from
the remains and compare it to the samples in their DNA bank.  What disturbs
Vlacovsky and Mayfield, and the Council of Responsible Genetics, is the
potential for misuse of the DNA information.  In response to their concerns, the
Pentagon has promised to destroy a "donors'" DNA information, tissue samples,
etc., when that person leaves the service.  However, there are absolutely *no*
laws requiring them to do so.  Haha... even if there were, it would be extremely
naive to actually think that the Pentagon would *destroy* DNA information.
After all, the Pentagon allows the FBI and other American law enforcement
agencies access to all of the DNA information they've taken with (or without in
my opinion) a court order.

The Canadian government has also been pushing for a national DNA bank.  It has
been proposed that all Canadians should be forced to submit tissue and blood
samples to this bank.  Big Brother is definitely wasting no time.  For some
reason, talk of this "mandatory" government DNA bank is on the backburner.  In
November 1997, a private member's bill was introduced to create a national DNA
bank to house DNA information from all convicts in Canada.

A extra bonus for Big Brother to create a DNA bank database of the entire
citizenry is greed.  Big Brother could make a fortune selling your DNA
information to foreign laboratories, big business, etc.  It's true.  In one
example, blood samples drawn from asthmatic inhabitants of the remote South
Atlantic island of Tristan da Cunha, led to asthma treatment technologies which
were sold to German medical monopoly Boehringer Ingelheim for $70 million.  Do
you think the islanders were paid any of the $70 million for the blood samples
they provided?  I highly doubt it.  Genetic laboratories in the United States
and Japan have been patenting DNA patterns for decades!  This even more proof
that Big Brother and big business see us all as commodities to be exploited and
controlled.  The precedent is if you give, or are forced to give, a blood or
tissue sample, you lose all rights to it.  Big Brother can literally "have
a piece of you" if they obtain a sample.

I hope that you take what I have written in this article seriously, and form
your own opinion.  It is horrid enough that Big Brother is attempting to take
our civil rights away so they can control us.  Now Big Brother desires to rape
us of our blood and bodily tissue, and our right to keep our own genetic make-up
private.  Especially if something can be used against a person by Big Brother in
an attempt to control that person.  And if a DNA sample is unique in some way,
Big Brother and his scientists are the ones that benefit, not the person that
provided it.  We all have a decision to make.  Do we submit our mind, body, and
soul to Big Brother, or do we fight for our privacy and rights?

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Tips for newbies on how to enter the h/p scene:

The main reason that I decided to write about how to enter the h/p scene is
because the majority of the newbies in 519 act like complete lamers... and then
they wonder why they're disrespected, mocked, laughed at and humiliated.  The
newbies try to pretend to know all about hacking (including hacking ISPs,
web sites etc.), phreaking (including stuff like scanning, PBXs, extenders,
diverters, ANI, CNA, loops, ringbacks, beige boxing, red boxing etc.)  The list
is almost endless.  Obviously, they can't fool us into thinking they have h/p
knowledge by spewing bullshit and lying.  One newbie in particular (ahem,
Highlord) doesn't seem to realize that extenders can be used for voice and
data... and talks about them as though they are just normal carriers (that you
connect to via modem)... that are just local diverters.  Hahaha.  Highlord also
claims to "program viruses in hex".  Other newbies are totally confused about
ANI.  By far the most hilarious are the newbies that talk about using PBXs, yet
they don't even know what a PBX is if you question them.  Or the newbies that
claim to scan or hack and they don't know shit about ToneLoc or unix.  I'm not
sure if they're trying to impress the well known, experienced users in the h/p
scene or not.  At any rate, it never works and they always end up looking like
lame fools.

Don't expect to be respected if you call learning "reading a text file" and
following the instructions.  You also won't gain any respect by bashing the
knowledgable hackers and phreaks.  And you won't get "instant respect" if you
start a wannabe "h/p group" or "h/p board"... when you don't know anything.
Don't upload trojans to boards and think that's hacking or think that it means
you're a hacker.  Don't think you're a phreak because you've used an extender
or know what PBX stands for because you don't know what phreaking means.  You
can't be the Sysop of a real h/p board if you're a newbie that knows less than
your users.  What will you do if they ask you a question that relates to h/p?
Do you think h/pers will actually call a wannabe board that's run by a newbie?
No, of course not.  Don't setup a board until you know something about what you
want it to support.  Basically, if you aren't a hacker or a phreak and not in
the h/p scene, don't setup a lame board and try to advertise it as being
"h/p/a/c/v/t".  If you do that, don't be too surprised if nobody that's in the
h/p scene calls and supports it.  ;)  And don't be shocked if it's constantly
being bashed and named the lamest board in the area code.

Now that I've covered some of the things that you *shouldn't* do (unless of
course your goal is to be the biggest lamer in your area code)... I will now
explain how newbies should enter the h/p scene.  First, call the respected h/p
boards in your local area.  Ask for access politely and post an intelligent
new user application.  Don't kiss the Sysop's ass or attempt to fool them into
thinking you're not a newbie.  If you chat with them, let them know that you're
genuinely interested in learning more about h/p... and want to become part of
the local h/p scene.  Ask them for advice, but don't ask them any questions
like "How do I hack?  How do I....."  If you overload them with stupid
questions, they might just become annoyed or pissed off at you.  Afterall,
nobody likes to answer a million fucking questions...muchless ones that a newbie
asks them.  Thus, don't expect to get direct answers about everything h/p
related that you've ever wanted to know.  It isn't that easy.  It takes time.
You have to learn many things on your own.  Download some text files and some
utilities (like ToneLoc etc.) that you'll need.  Read through the text files.
Read through the ToneLoc docs.  Read every issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.
Start scanning some local exchanges.  Start learning about tones.  You might
be surprised at what you can find and learn about.  ;)  Once you have learned
about a few things, don't start bragging or think that you know everything...
Don't get a big ego or develop an attitude.  If you've only been learning about
h/p for a few weeks or months, then you are still considered to be a newbie.
Also, don't apply to all of the local h/p groups in your area.  You still lack
experience, which is something that's very important and cannot be faked.  Once
you've done a few things (found some PBXs, extenders, diverters, VMBs etc.)
and hacked some codes (like passcodes etc.)... and have some experience using
ToneLoc, PBXs, extenders, diverters etc. then by all means apply to some h/p
groups that you're interested in joining.  Or if joining a h/p group doesn't
interest you, that's fine.  Obviously, you can still associate with hackers and
phreaks, exchange ideas and information... and learn from them and any advice
they might decide to give you.  ;)  Once you've learned the h/p basics, you
will find that people are more willing to give you advice and help.  As for
gaining their trust, respect and becoming accepted as part of the h/p scene,
that is something you will have to figure out on your own.  The only tip I can
give is that you'll have to earn their trust and respect.  It's not something
that can be instantly gained.  You'll have to prove that you are trustworthy,
have some knowledge, respect others that are in the h/p scene (especially those
that were in involved in h/p long before you knew what it was) etc.  You have
to show that by your actions and words.  If you aren't dedicated and active in
the h/p scene, it'll be evident to them and very noticeable.  If you do nothing
but constantly ask questions, that shows that you aren't reading, learning or
doing anything to progress.  Thus, take the initiative to learn as much as you
can and become self-taught.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Forcing an old dog to learn new tricks:

    Microsoft Corp's long monopolistic reign over the desktop/business
PC market may have reached an inevitable conclusion.  Crucial 
marketing decisions made by the greedy company have, and still are
being scrutinized by corporate and government groups, working towards
learning the extent to which Microsoft violated anti-competitive
laws in order to increase their profits.
    Anti-competitive business practices, such as forcing users of the
soon-to-be-released Windows 98 to use their Internet Explorer 4.0 have
alerted high-end developers, and low-end users across the globe to what
most of us knew all along - Microsoft is a bully.  In fact, the United
States Department of Justice has agreed with us on this one;
finding Microsoft guilty of violating anti-competitive laws in the 
recent IE 4.0 dispute.  As a result, Microsoft now has to ship over 3
versions of the anticipated 'Windows 98' (including one 'IE 4.0 Free').
    The byte does not stop here.  In an attempt to gain a monopoly of
Internet-related applications, Microsoft had also violated universal 
agreements on the compatibility of JAVA applets across various 
platforms.  What this means is that Microsoft wanted PCs connected
to the web (running Win95/98) to run JAVAScript apps coded
only by other Microsoft developers.  This decision also created 
an uproar in the computing industry, leading to the development of
many 'Anti-Microsoft' groups. <g>
    Microsoft's competition seems to have finally realized the power they
hold when they join together to fight the greed.  Vendors such as
Sun Microsystems have jumped in response to these events, and are starting
to release low-end workstations designed to compete specifically with
NT 4.0 systems.  (Codename: DARWIN).
    JAVA has played an important role in all this; serving as symbol
against OS-Specific JAVA Code.  Users and developers alike have warmed
to the idea of versatile code, full compatibility issues, and
multi-platform flexibility - seen in the increased interest in alternative
Operating Systems such as Linux, and x86 based SunOS (Desktop UNIX).
    It appears Microsoft has made some fatal moves.
    Microsoft assumed they could maintain their narrow-minded, 
short-sighted business practices, and still realize great profits.  
How ignorant they were though, of the forces of the universe always
at work.  The universe thrives on change, and the longer something
remains static, the more dramatic its termination.  Just ask the 
dinosaurs.

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                           {NEWS}
An Introduction to VMBs:

This article contains some useful information on VMBs (Voice Mail Boxes) for
beginners and advanced phreaks.  Actually, it's an introduction to VMBs that
is intended for newbies to read.  :)

First, not all VMB systems are the same.  Some are local, others are 1-800s.
There are several types of VMBs and each has it's own unique features, defaults
etc.  I'm not going to describe all of them or give any "specific" information
on how to hack them.  However, I will give a brief summary of the basics of
each commonly used VMB system.  If you aren't familiar with voice mail and have
not had the priviledge of using it before, then you'll probably find this
article interesting.  Otherwise, it might seem a little boring if you already
know all about VMBs, use them regularly and have your own personal box etc.  In
that case, just skip this section and read the next article.

Most text files and articles on VMBs lack critical information and just say "You
really need a 1-800 VMB.  Buy one from a phreak or scan 1-800s to find one using
ToneLoc, and then try to hack it using default passcodes."  Of course,
Damage, INC. has much higher standards and would never write or release anything
that lacks the necessary content and quality that our readers have grown to
expect.  :)

At this point, you might be asking "Why do I need a 1-800 VMB?" though.  The
answer is that they are useful for staying in contact with people, contacting
new people (like phreaks from other area codes), trading codes and information,
and learning.  Some VMBs also allow you to dial out from them.  Plus, they're
free to call and most 1-800 VMBs are accessible throughout North America (some
are limited to Canada).  And, you don't have to give out your voice number
anymore once you have your own VMB box.  As for buying a VMB from a h/per in
your area code, you shouldn't begin by "buying codes".  If you get into the
habit of doing that, you might start relying on everyone else in the h/p scene
to do everything for you.  That isn't a good way to enter the h/p scene or learn
anything.  The main point is, you learn absolutely nothing by purchasing a VMB
from someone else.  In other words, you won't even be used to or know about the
VMB that you paid for.  You'd have to spend some time becoming familiar with the
system and learning, so why not do that first before you take the easy way out
by paying someone else cash to do the work for you?

Okay, now you want to know how to get started scanning and hacking VMBs.  There
are several ways that you can begin.  You could use ToneLoc (or another scanner)
and scan 1-800s trying to find a VMB.  Or, you could talk to some phreaks in
your area code and they might point you in the right direction (ie. they might
tell you to try scanning in 1-800-999-XXXX as an example).  Another option is
to dial 10 random 1-800 numbers a day, a few times per week for a period of a
couple of months and make a list.  That method is fairly safe, and it should
ensure that you find some 1-800 VMBs, PBXs, ANIs, extenders etc.  Then you can
investigate the cool 1-800s and forget about the rest.  :)  Of course, you
should only try to hack the Virgin VMB systems.  (VMBs that haven't been hacked
already by other phreaks).  Hack safely and always use a good diverter.  You
might also find some VMB systems by watching television or looking at products
(ie. Customer Support numbers, or just VMBs setup for their employees to use).

Once you've found a Virgin VMB system, identify what type of VMB system it is
before you attempt to start scanning.  (Read the section on identifying VMB
systems that's later in this article).  Scanning just means, searching for
boxes that you can hack.  Basically, you'll want to find a box that isn't
already being used by someone.  That is, unless you just want to listen to
other people's messages and don't want your own box.

I'm not going to take the time to explain guest boxes, dialing out etc.  You
will have to figure out how to use the more advanced features of VMBs on your
own.  As for hacking the VMB, this is a generic method.  Call the VMB and when
you hear the automated message asking for a box number, try entering 999, 999#
or #999.  (With some VMBs you might have to enter a 0, 9, #, * or a different
number first to access it).  After you enter 999, there are a number of possible
results.  It might tell you the Box owner's name, report that you've entered
an invalid box number, or ask for a password/passcode.  If it says "MailBox XXX"
or "Please leave a message" or just prompts you for a password, then more than
likely you've found a nice, hackable, unused, virgin box.  For the passcode, try
using some defaults.  If the Box Number (BN) is 999 then try entering:

        BN      = 999
        1+BN    = 1999
        0+BN    = 0999
        BN+0    = 9990
        BN-1    = 998

...or the BN backwards.  BN 123 would be 321 etc.  Some lamers don't even use
a passcode at all or they leave it as default.  Hahaha.  However, that's quickly
changing now that people are discovering that hackers and phreaks exist.

There are some other defaults as well, or common ones such as 000, 111 for 3
digit passcodes, 0000, 1111 etc. for 4 digits.  The default passcode might also
be the same for every box.  It could also be the last 4 digits of the actual
VMB number.  Try the BN first, and look for boxes that have a generic greeting
message.  Once you manage to get into a box, you can use it to start scanning.
That way, you can scan for boxes (while logged in) without getting disconnected.
The way to start scanning varies with each type of VMB system.  For ASPEN VMB
systems, you press 3 from the main menu.  Then you enter in a box number.
Just keep scanning boxes and writing down the ones that you think might be
hackable.  :)  You don't have to scan randomly either.  Continue scanning until
you reach the lowest box number.  In other words, you can go from box number
999 to 000.  You should know what the default box number system is for the VMB
at this point.  Every hackable box should have the same default password.  That
is what makes hacking them so easy.  So, if the box that you're using to scan
with used BN as the default passcode, then every open, hackable box will use BN
as well.  That means if box number 111 is hackable, the default passcode is the
BN... which is 111.  :)  You should be able to get a nice list of hackable
boxes, and get into some of them easily enough.  Does this seem difficult to
you?  If it does, you're a complete moron and should stick to calling lame warez
boards.  Hehe.  Here's a tip for you.  If you are hand scanning (looking for
VMBs by manually dialing them with your phone) or hand hacking, store the VMB
number into memory dial.  Or you can write a Telix script for hacking boxes.

Why only try to hack Virgin Systems?  Why take an unused or abandoned box?
Well, they last the longest for one thing.  They don't attract suspicion and
the sys admin isn't going to be alerted by someone that paid for a box when
their passcode is changed.  Plus, you won't be fucking up any other phreaks if
it's a virgin VMB system.  Another thing to remember is, the messages in your
box (once you hack one) aren't as secure as you think...even after you've
changed the passcode and greeting.  So, don't use any personal information and
avoid getting busted.  Take the unused/virgin boxes (watch them to see how
often they're used/not used) and don't fuck with every box on the system.  :)


Identifying different types of VMB systems:

ASPEN systems - This is considered the best VMB system, and it has many useful
features.  You are allowed to have two greeting messages, create guest accounts,
leave urgent or regular messages, and much more.  ASPENs are easy to recognize
because of the extremely annoying female voice.  When you dial one up, you might
have to enter * to get into the system, or you might not.  Now press # to login.
The system will prompt you for your mailbox number.  After three invalid mailbox
number tries, you will be disconnected.  If you enter a valid box number, you
will be prompted for the passcode.  It is usually the box number or the box
number + 0.  Once you're logged in, you can press 3 from the main menu to scan
for other boxes without being disconnected.  Always login first.

CINDY systems - This is another nice system.  It will start by saying "Good
morning/afternoon/evening.  Please enter the mailbox number you wish".  After 3
invalid entries it will cut you off.  To login, enter the box number, and
during the greeting press 0 then the passcode.  The default passcode for all
CINDY systems is 0.  :)  From the main menu once logged in, press 6 to scan for
other boxes without being disconnected like you would if you weren't logged in.
You can create guest accounts for someone.  They would login just like you,
except they would enter their passcode.  You can leave them messages this way.

Message Center systems - These are another popular VMB system.  To login, enter
a box.  During the greeting, hit * to log in.  It will then ask for your
passcode.  Enter it.  These VMBs have tricky password methods.  They will stop
you 1 digit more than the real passcode length.  If you enter "12345" and it
tells you that you're wrong, that means the code is only 4 digits long.  If you
enter an incorrect passcode the first time, no matter what you put in, it will
say that it's wrong.  From the main menu while logged in, type 6 to scan for
other boxes without being disconnected.

Q Voice Mail systems - These are not a very commonly used VMB system.  You'll
know that it's a Q VMB if it says "Welcome to Q Voice Mail paging."  The box
numbers are normally 5 digits, and you hit 0 during the greeting to login.
From the main menu while logged in, enter 3 to scan for other boxes without
being disconnected.  You will be promptly disconnected if you aren't logged in
and try scanning for other boxes.

MERIDIAN Mail - With this VMB you'll probably hear the default greeting message
of "MERIDIAN Mail.  Please enter your mail box number followed by # sign."  If
you wait for a few seconds it'll say "For more information press *."  After
you've entered a valid box number it'll ask "Password?" and then "Please enter
your password followed by # sign." after a few seconds of inactivity.

(Since I have not personally used all of the above types of VMB systems, the
source for some of the information used was from an iTS text file - Internal
Theft Syndicate.  However, I did modify it and added my own comments.  So, iTS
deserves some credit for their good release.  The entire MERIDIAN Mail section
wasn't in the iTS text file etc.)

HEED THIS WARNING:  Don't try to hack other phreak's VMB systems.  If you fuck
up trying to hack someone's box, then there's a great chance the admin that runs
the VMB will be alerted by them.  Not only will you be caught, but everyone else
will lose the box that they've been using.  The default box passcodes will also
be changed, the security will be strengthened and the company that owns the VMB
will be paranoid from then on.  So, be wise and avoid doing that shit.  Stick
with Virgin Systems if at all possible and don't do anything stupid.  If you
require information on a specific VMB system, then I recommend that you read h/p
text files that contain the information on hacking VMBs and explain the system,
it's features etc. in greater detail.  I know that there are many text files and
zines available on AJFA that would be helpful to you.  There are other sources
for that type of information as well that you might want to search.

List of some 1-800 VMBs for you to check out:

1-800-284-6245 - VMB (Meridian Mail)
1-800-543-7108 - John Hancock Customer Service (hit *7 to access the VMB)
1-800-669-1800 - Burger King's Voice Mail System.

In closing, I hope that you've enjoyed reading this article and learned the
basics of VMBs.  The extender above was provided by BLACKENED.  We're not going
to start including huge lists of codes or anything though.  If you want to find
1-800s etc. then you are responsible for scanning/hacking them yourself.  We're
not going to provide codes with passcodes for you.  :)  Experiment and try to
learn as much as possible on your own.  Don't just use the codes that we give
you as examples.  That'd be very lame.  It'd also mean that you're too fucking
lazy to scan and find anything.  Don't limit yourself to just using codes that
are written in text files.  Afterall, that's the opposite of what phreaking is
all about.  That would defeat the purpose of writing articles such as this.  You
basically have to take the initiative, become active and dedicated to learning.
I'll assure you that text files (even ones that were written recently) do not
contain information on everything related to phreaking.  In fact, there are
always going to be new systems, new technology etc.  Pioneers that are curious
and willing to explore, find codes, find and learn new systems are always in
demand.  The sense of accomplishment that you get from making a discovery can
be amazing.  I suggest you make it your personal goal to become a true phreak.

INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}
Fatal Vision's interrogation of Highlord:

Fatal Vision sent me this interrogation of Highlord, and I felt that it should
be published and shared with the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter... ;)
The bottom portion that contains Highlord's definitions for various things is
hilarious.  Enjoy.


<FV> = Fatal Vision
<H>  = Highlord

<FV> - Yeah, I am here man.. ;)  So what's up?

<H> - well nuthin much i was just reading some text files thats it though.

<FV> - Really?  What were the text files about?

<H> - hacking unix

<FV> - Yeah..  That's cool man ;)  You wanna chat about h/p for a bit?  I am
really new to h/p and you could probably teach me a little bit..

<H> - really...hmmm...thats interestin i thought you knew way more than me..

<FV> - Nah..  I don't know much..  I'll ask you some questions..   Do you know
what a PBX stands for?  Do you have any PBX Numbers?  Do you use a PBX?

<H> - well actually i used to but i forgot what it means but i have it in a text
file...i dont have any pbx numbers yet i dont think but i am workin on a
number i am getting from a friend and if i had a number i would definitely
use a pbx.

<FV> - Okay.. What about ANI? Diverters? Extenders?

<H> - well hmmm....i dunno what an ANI is :( diverters i think are numbers you
call to call another place like and extender....

<FV> - Hmm.. Okay..  Uhmm. Oh Do you have a Win95 Internet account man?  I saw
your posts on FoI about that... Do you have any Win95 accounts? (you don't have
to give me the username/passcode).  Do you know what a beige box is?  Have you
gone boxing?

<H> - ok well i dont have a win95 account i used to but it got busted due to my
carelessnes but i have learned more in the mean time like log editing. i have 
unix ones and thats about it cause thats what i mainly use. i think i know
what a biege box does but im not sure i dont really follow the box
things...and no i have not been boxing but i want to.

<FV> - Yeah.. Okay.. Are you and Taskmaster gonna go Boxing together?  Are you
on any Long Distance (LD) Boards?  What boards in 519 do you call?

<H> - well hmm....i dont think me and him will box together i think thats more
of an individual thing...i am on one LD board but i think its down but it was
only a company board with utils... i call scorched :(, suicide solution
occasionaly but only for full ver stuff....FoI,   druids keep :(, 5th dim :(
coolguys freezer, outlaw rave, brain damage, and thats about it...oh yeah and 
this one if you let me stay on.

<FV> - Hehe ;)..  You call quite a few boards in this area..  What do you think
of Coolguy's Freezer?  I haven't called their in ages..  What do you think about
FoI?  Are you on And Justice For All?  I really want access there..  He said
he might give it to me..

<H> - yeah well he said hed lemme know when they are accepting new users. Well i
think coolguys freezer kinda sucks...i only get some files there and thats
about it...i like FoI alot cause its the only good board im on and i have
learned alot from it.

<FV> - Yeah..  What happened to Jacknife BBS? With that 11 year old SysOp?  Did
you hack him or something?  What do you think about Blackened?  The Journalist?

<H> - well jacknife....i think he forgot to pay ma bell ;) well i hacked him but
i was his co sysyop hehehe yeah and i got his user files and stuff but i didnt
crash it....i think Blackened is a good hacker with a big ego but i respect
him and he helps me when i ask him about stuff...The Journalist has been very 
helpful to me and we have chatted many times///but recently he has been a
little annoying cause he thinks im a security prob.

<FV> - Hehehe..  Yeah.. So you hacked Jacknife then?  Why do you think Blackened
has an ego though?  That's what some people have been saying... But I really
can't understand why..  Do you know what having an "ego" means?

<H> - hehe well with jacknife i was his co so it wasnt really a hack....but i
think Blackened has an ego just by the way he talks to ya when you post to
him....like when i said i was working on GT he said really so what are you
doing are you worried about security? how long have you been doing this?
etc.... i dunno why people say im a security prob but im not gonna argue....i 
know what an ego is...........anyway shit my mom says i should go :( ill talk 
abit more but then i gotta go....will you be around tmorow at 5?

<FV> - Yeah.. Well I think you should consider some of the stuff Blackened says.
In My Opinion he is trying to help ya..  5:00pm? Near supper?  Yeah I should
be around..  The things you stated about why you think Blackened has an Ego
doesn't really match the description "ego".. So that's why I asked..  Have
you applied to Damage, INC.?  Do you know how to list files in unix? I forget
how..

<H> - ok well i do listen to Blackened i dont mean that having an ego is bad its
just what i feel when i talk to him.... ill call tmorow at 430 or 500 to talk 
to ya...wellli havent applied to damage inc cause im runnin my own group well 
im startin to...i have a few members but....so far nuthin has happened and we 
need a headquarters......to list files in unix type "ls"

<FV> - Okay..  Yeah.. so are you the "prez" What's the group called? Who's the
members?

<H> - ok well i am the head of the group.....but its called The Shadows.....the
members are well...me, taskmaster, /zero, and thats it for now.

<FV> - Alright man.. I'll let ya go..  Yeah Just page me tomorrow or something..
at about 4:30-5:00 then..

<H> - ok i will...if your not in or somethin just call me voice....

<FV> - Yeah.. I am around man ;)

<H> - yeah i figured you would be./...for some reason my 14.4 wont pick up
ansi...i think its screwed...so are you gonna put up the other board?

<FV> - I just got a new system.. So I still have to put Eternity on from
backups..;) My old computer basically fried..   Anyways, So you want some more
q/a's eh ;)

<H> - whatever you want...i dont really care....

<FV> - Alright..  Hmm..  What do you think anarchy stands for?  What do you
think about our Government?

<H> - ok hold on a sec my cat wants out :) ok well anarchy hmmm you mean like
what does the A the N stand for that kinda thing or overall? overall i think it
means basically having fun the way you want and our shitty government decids
that it is wrong but it borders on the legal/illegal border not that i care
about doing things the "Legal" way....our government i despise i think they
are a bunch of morons who dont know anythin and are screwin up our country
and us.....like Bell ;) anyway i really dont like our government and i am
always trying to find out new stuff they try to get themselves involved in...

<FV> - Hehe.. ;)  Hmm.. Okay..  Do you know what Cracker Jack is?  Who is this
hacker that you know that's LD?

<H> - hahahaha you heard about that eh? well cracker jack is a pword cracker you
can get different versions but i have the unix one...this hacker well he Had
a website and i hacked it and fucked him over because we got in an
arguement...he moved and learned everything he could about hpvac and quickly
got better then me...but he uses diferent aliases....a source of mine told me 
he wanted to take me out and i found out who he was for real and i threatened 
to tell the cops about him so he took off <g>

<FV> - Why would you call the cops on him?   As for Cracker Jack is there a
Win95 one? ;)   You hacked his Webpage?

<H> - well it was an empty threat but i know he is afraid of the cops so i
figured may as well scare him a little ;) for win95 there is a prog called
Claymore that does that....i dont know of a crcker jack one.....and i just
hacked the isp well i knew the pwords.....and i took him down and screwed his
system with a few trojans......

<FV> - Oh.. Hmm let's chat a bit about your "h/p" group..   What does it take
to be a member?  Do you have any releases?  What do you focus on?  Why was it
created? etc?

<H> - well im gonna tell you stuff but i dont want you posting on FoI about my
little lameass group ok?

<FV> - Why are you calling your own group lame?

<H> - im not i read your interesting post about my group called the "prezzes" or
somethin like that.

<FV> - Huh?  That was about a different group.. I didn't even know you had a
group until last night..

<H> - oh ok well nevermind then....anyway i dont want you posting on FoI about
it though ok? i know TJ and Blackened will make fun of me or annoy me...

<FV> - Hahaha...  Okay.. I won't post it on FoI. ;)

<H> - ok thanx ;) anyway ok i created it cause well to be honest everyone knows
519 is dead....i want to bring another h/p group into the scene and try to get
more people into it. We have had no releases yet but that was because we had
our headquarters on scorched earth and stallion was in on it and then screwed 
everyone for talking about hacking and shit....so we kinda got lost...but im
trying to bring it back....our main focus is to bring useful info about hpvac 
to the 519 community and to create awareness of Bell Microsoft and our
Corrupt government....To become a member you must show some sort of
dedication and intelligence and promise not to talk to non-members about our
actions and the  your in if i allow you to be.... thats about it...we also
have a vote to see if you get in or not.

<FV> - Stallion *screwed* everyone for talking about hacking? Hahah.. That's
hilarious man..   So you don't plan on realizing your shit to Freedom Of
Information then?  Why only upload it to Scorched Earth?  Especially since
it's not a h/p board..

<H> - OK well i do plan on releasing it to FoI but only

=> User disconnected

Recorded with user: The Highlord
Chat reason: ......
------------------------------------

<H> - ok that was call waiting but its disabled now.....anyway i do plan on
releasing the stuff to FoI but first i would like people to give me an
opinion on it. I will not u/l it to scorched because well...stallion is a
fuckin moron......and he runs a warez board......thats about it....

<FV> - I thought Stallion is going to have your files online?  You call that
board though right?  You still call warez boards?

<H> - well to tell ya the truth i call it only to piss of people :) they dont
like me cause i dont like warez...so screw em :) anyway no stallion has no
files of mine on his board...he is trying  to setup an h/p file area but me and
tweakie are the only people who use it hehehe and i do call some warez boards 
but only if i want a full ver thing and they have it..i dont go getting new
warez to double click and calim to hack....besides i dont use microsoft
products at all.

<FV> - Really?  How did you find that little lame "trick" in Win95 then? Hehe..
I read about that on FoI..

<H> - i figured people would read it thats why i posted it...well i used to use
MS products b4 i got into hpvac and then i realsized how much MS sucks and vowed
never to use their products at all :)
i found the trick when i had windoze....

<FV> - Oh.. I see..  I read somewhere that you can program viruses? Is that
true?  Hex is a *hard* language man.. Fuck..  Hahah

<H> - well i dont program in hex i merely edit the file so it has a viral
effect...im tryin to learn about programmin viruses but so far i cant do
anything good...i just try to take a source code and change it around...i
have text files that help me do that...

<FV> - What Language do you use? Hex?

<H> - well i use hex to edit things but im using c and uhh...  <cough>...basic
:(

<FV> - Hahah..  That's hilarious ;)  Who do you think is the *biggest* lamer in
this area?

<H> - well hmmm..... to me well i hate Floyd the Jackass but id hafta say
Spike Jr.

<FV> - Oh..  Yeah.. Someone Said Spike Jr hacked that Jacknife board eh..

<H> - hahaha spike couldnt hack anything...he wasnt even on there......well he
got pissed off at me for hacking his board...still hasnt changed his pword
HAHAHAHA!!!!!

<FV> - Yeah he was on Jacknife man ;)  And It doesn't take much to nuke a board
in this area..  Just rename a quality trojan, and upload it to a board..  ;)  It
doesn't take much for someone to get the SysOp to run it either...   Ah well, 
that board was lame anyways.. I saw your posts there and had to laugh ;)

<H> - hahaha yeah i only posted cause he told me too....but i was his co sysop
and i felt i may as well try to make it a little less lame...but the fucker
forgot to payoff bell.....so he dont got a line this month.....

<FV> - How do you know?

<H> - hmmm....well he called me on voice and told me......

<FV> - Really?  Your not lying to me?  He's 11 years old.. How could *he* pay
for the line?  His parents would probably pay for it and I don't think they
would forget..

<H> - no he was paying for it...he has a little shitty paper route and his
parents dont even want him running a board so they dont help him.....i think the
beel bill got lost in the mail thats what he said.....

<FV> - If he seriously told you that, I'd have to say "bull-shit" ;)  He probably
just can't admit that he got hacked.. 

<H> - i guess hes lying but i dont really care hes a lamer with a lame board and
i just changed some stuff for somethin to do...... but....oh well.

<FV> - Hahaha!  Do you know what Social Engineering is?

<H> - no fuckin idea.

<FV> - Oh.. Heheh..  Did you ever figure out about what PBX stands for?

<H> - nope had no time and dont really care but ill look l8er.......

<FV> - Hehehe.. You don't really care what it stands for?? Hahaha.. How can you
use one if you don't even know what it's called ;)   Just one more question for
ya.  How are you avoiding being caught while hacking ISPs?

<H> - ok well i meant i dont care that i didnt have any time...sorry worded it
wrong....but i am editing all the logs and i hack em from other peoples
houses... but i just change their logs and always use *67 even if it dont
work too good.

<FV> - Who's houses do you hack them from? Taskmaster?  Hehe.. As for *67.. Haha
that's hilarious man.. Do you think that does anything?

<H> - well bell invented it and i read enough text files to know it doesnt do
anything but its in my dialout thingy so i dont care.....but no ive never
been to taskmasters house...i call from friends houses who dont know what
bbses or the internet are hehehee.

<FV> - Hahaha..  I just wanted to know what "Elite h/p" is?

<H> - well your talkin about 2 different things.....elite is like well warez and
shit like that like emulators and shit and h/p is hacking/phreaking well you
probably knew that ;)

<FV> - Hahah.. Yeah. I probably know a little more then you think ;)..   How come
when you left me e-mail before with your real information you said you would
upload all your "Elite hp" if I gave you access?   Do you know what
h/p/a/c/v/t stands for?

<H> - yes did i post that? hmmm must have been smokin somethin ;) i dunno why
i did though..oh well just a mistake....hacking/phreaking/anarchy/viruses/
trojans/carding

<FV> - Yeah you did post that..  Anyways dood, I've gotta get going..  Don't
give this number to anyone..  I noticed you already have though.. <g>

<H> - huh? to who? i did to /zero but he just wanted to make sure that number
was for here.......

<FV> - Oh.. Alright..  I'll let ya go though.. I've got some work to do now ;)

<H> - ok yeah whatever...you want to continue this discussion l8er?

<FV> - Sure..

I just finished reading DAMAGE.005... and want to give you some feedback
man.  I've read all of the issues of the Damage, INC. Newsletter now and
think the January issue is the best that you've released.  Your quote is
accurate.  They are addictive.  I really enjoyed the Introduction and the
drug metaphor that you used.  That really linked it to the quote "Addictive
but not lethal."

The Big Brother Bashing article you wrote really opened my eyes and made
me think seriously about smart cards and microchips... and how they can be
used against us.

The article on data recovery techniques contains some very good info.  I
am looking forward to reading your tip of the month for February.

The Conspiracies and Coverups article relating to the thought police, h/p
and the laws should be read by anyone that hacks and phreaks.  Shatazar
must've spent some time researching Bill C-17 and the criminal code... and
deserves credit for informing us.

The Corruption and Greed article that Blackie Lawless wrote on Saddam Hussein
was very interesting and well written.

The h/p information that Blackie Lawless wrote should be read by newbies.
Even though I phreak and know about PBXs, I still learned something.  I
hope he writes more h/p articles in the future.  :)

The interrogation of Bill Gates that Damage, INC. did was simply hilarious!
Hahahaha.  I read through it several times and enjoyed it immensely.  It
was really creative too.

Shatazar's Objective Opinions article on Robert Latimer was well written.
It made me think about the federal government and question why they don't
act.

The Reports from the Front article on the New World Order was humorous,
sarcastic, and satyrical.  I suggest you include more articles like that.

I looked through the Fade to Black source code in the Source and Scripts
section... and managed to learn a few things about assembly.  :)

The "Visions in Fire" essay was well written, and had a powerful message.
As always, your Closing Comments put the finishing touches on the issue.
Overall, I think Damage, INC. did an excellent job.  I hope to contribute
soon.

Editor - Thanks for the feedback man.  ;)  We'll take your suggestions into
         consideration.  If we can find more articles like the New World Order
         one, then we'll definitely include them.  I'm glad you learned a few
         things about assembly, PBXs etc. from the last issue.  As for the
         laws on h/p, I hope that information proves to be helpful.  You can
         also be assured that Damage, INC. will continue to inform the readers
         of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  I personally look forward to you
         contributing.  I am very open to new ideas and welcome any different
         opinions and perspectives that you might have.  ;)


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
Calling the kettle black.

The United States of America is currently fascinated by a real life soap opera.
Beloved President Bill Clinton is embroiled in a sex scandal, which supposedly
threatens his presidency.  Bill Clinton is accused of using his position as
President, and previously as Governor of Arkansas, to cultivate sexual relations
with women.  After Paula Jones filed suit against Clinton, women like Monica
Lewinsky and Kathleen Willey have come out of the woodwork.

Aren't there more important issues that Americans should concentrate on?  Most
definitely.  And yet the Clinton sex scandal, and the coverup that followed has
dominated the attention of politicians, the media, and most of the zombies in
America's citizenry.  Personally, I feel this whole ordeal is sheer lunacy.
However, this whole sex scandal really epitomizes what is at the core of
"western society."

One obvious fact regarding this "issue" is the fact that it's a power play.
The Republicans are using this scandal to attack Clinton so they can weaken the
Democrats before the upcoming presidential election.  It is no coincidence that
prosecutor Kenneth Starr has connections to the Republican Party.  The
Republicans can see that Clinton is vulnerable, and they are going in for the
kill.  Using their allies in the religious right, they are attacking Clinton on
what they consider to be high moral ground.

I wasn't stunned when Linda Tripp came out of the blue with her audio tapes.
Linda Tripp befriended Lewinsky, got her to open up about her dealings with
Clinton, and then recorded them without Lewinsky's knowledge.  Tripp took
advantage of the fact that in the state of Virginia (where their office was)
it's legal for one party of a conversation to record it without other person's
knowledge.  Linda Tripp, like the Republicans, is an opportunist taking
advantage of Clinton's sexual escapades.  No doubt she will sell her audio tapes
for a king's ransom.

Don't forget another group of opportunists that have been feeding off of
Clinton... the mass media.  The media are totally out of control.  At one point,
I saw Monica Lewinsky portrayed as a naive 21-year-old intern with low
self-esteem, influenced and seduced by a horny president.  Another media source
has described Lewinsky as a slut that took her intern position so she could have
the dubious honour of blowing the President of the United States.  It is obvious
to me that the media will do anything to give this scandal, which has been
beaten to death, a different slant so they can sell their story.

Meanwhile, the media is stalking Lewinsky.  When she went to visit her father in
California, she had a taste of what Princess Diana dealt with.  Ironically, a
member of the press chased Lewinsky's car down a California highway.  This
paparazzi reporter actually hit her car from behind!  Fortunately for Lewinsky,
she didn't lose her life like Diana did.  I'm sure the photographer was pleased
with himself though.  After all, for a small fine, he created a photo
opportunity and a story.  And yet the media is extremely quick to judge
Clinton's sexual affairs.  I've even heard media members say "the President
of the Unites States is the moral leader of this country."  Yeah right.
I've also heard the media report "in the United States, there is a division
between church and state" during the vigil prior to Carla Faye Tucker's
execution.  Which one is it?  The media always tries to have it both ways.

At first I shook my head at Clinton for having affairs with young interns that
were trying to build careers.  Clinton is not unlike most politicians that abuse
the power of their position.  What really sickened me is that Clinton is being
attacked because he was "morally in the wrong."  Clinton's critics are ones to
call the kettle black.  The Republicans have had many scandals when they held
power.  Does the Iran-Contra scandal bring back memories of their lack of
morality?  And how about the mass media?  They have no right to judge anyone on
moral grounds.  If you don't agree with me, reread BLACKENED's article about the
mass media in the November 1997 issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  They are
as immoral as any corrupt politician.  

I'm not going to let Clinton and his buddy Al Gore off the hook either.
Remember all of the "family values" speeches that Clinton and Gore spout so
feverously?  Haha... It appears that Clinton's values include trading
professional favours for sex.  Do you see the message that these people with
power send out to people that want to be influenced?  Do as I say, not as I do.
The definition of hypocrisy.  And hypocrisy definitely isn't moral, although it
is acceptable in "society."  I do not say this tongue-in-cheek.  President Bill
Clinton's popularity has never been higher than it is right now.

All I have discussed, in my opinion, is at the heart of not only Clinton's sex
scandal, but it is the very core of "society."  Political and economic power
plays, betrayal of friendship, overzealousness, unaccountability, greed, lust,
and hypocrisy are only a few words that can be used to describe what skills are
necessary in order to enjoy the "American Dream" as it exits right now.  The
next time you hear someone criticizing someone else on moral grounds, be sure to
think of the source of the words first.  Especially if that person is part of
the government or the mass media.

REPORTS FROM THE FRONT -                                          {REPORTS}

After reading Damage INC.'s fifth issue this morning, I came across an article
in the Toronto Sun which ties in quite nicely with the Big Brother Bashing.

Big Brother's watching, hearing told:

Ottawa dished out $31 million in the early 1980s for a state-of-the-art
computer software program to keep track of Canadians, a secret refugee hearing
was told.  The U.S.-made Promis system interfaced with any data base and
provided information on a person's credit cards, banking, pension, tax,
criminal and immigration records, transcripts obtained by the Toronto Sun
showed.

The program could spit out details of a person's health care and even library
transactions.

"If you ever had a driver's licence you would be on the program," Ari Ben
Menashe, once an adviser to former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir,
told a secret Immigration and Refugee Board hearing last June.

"No data base existed then that could interface with other data bases," he
said.

"This software can by used on any Canadian in any jurisdiction," Richard
Kurland, lawyer for U.S. refugee claimant, Alexander Henri Legault, said.
"It can be used by the government to play big brother."

Updated versions of the software are reportedly still being used by the RCMP
and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.  CSIS and RCMP officials
could not be reached for comment.

The board is expected to rule any day on the fate Legault, 49, who says he'll
be persecuted by the CIA for blowing the whistle on a Montreal brainwashing
experiment, code named MK-Ultra, in the 1950s and 1960s.

The experiments headed by the late Dr. Ewen Cameron and funded by the CIA,
subjected unwitting patients to hallucinogenic drugs, weeks of forced sleep
and massive doses of shock therapy.

The hearing was also told the CIA used contaminated mosquitos to spread
dengue fever to parts of the Caribbean and Cuba, and conducted drug tests on
abducted derelicts and prostitutes snatched off the streets of San Francisco.
Most of them died.

Disposal CIA units called "Team B" were then called to get rid of the corpses
the hearing was told.


This article was published in the Monday February 2, 1998 issue of the
Toronto Sun.

My thoughts on this article?  If the CIA can do things like what I've
mentioned above, then what makes us think that the government didn't
collaborate on making the AIDS virus and spreading that around to control
the population?

In my opinion, Big Brother has WAY too much control in not only our country,
but the whole world.  They can track our every move and dictate what we
can and cannot do.  It's asinine, and it's time we did something about it.


Another thing I noticed when I received my phone bill this month, $30.00 for
local service and a line which has absolutely nothing on it.  I use this line
for my computer only and it also has a toll restriction so I can't make long
distance calls (I put this feature on myself)

Because Bell has a monopoly in the field on local calls, they must feel that
they can raise rates.  But I feel that paying $30.00/month for ONE phone line
with absolutely no special features on it is absolutely ridiculous.  Ma Bell
needs a competitor in the local rates area and fast.

THE JOURNALIST'S TOP TEN LIST -                                   {TOP TEN}
"New movements within the industry"

    1.  MICROSOFT vs DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
        Microsoft's battle with the Department of Justice has so far resulted
        in a decision by judges to force Microsoft to sell Win98 packages
        that do not include their integrated browser "Internet Explorer 4.0."
        Eleven other states however, have joined together to get to the
        bottom of Microsoft's perhaps illegal business practices.  Microsoft
        Corporate offices in Japan were raided by officials, being forced
        to hand over legal documents, records, etc. to help understand to
        what degree Microsoft has violated anti-monopoly laws.

    2.  MERGER MANIA IN ISP-LAND
        Many factors influence the Internet providing industry, the main one
        being profit; and in the interest of profit, many large corporations
        are in the process buying out most medium sized ISPs to gain control
        over the market, and stabilize prices (and realize higher profit).
        Researchers estimate the computer industry will be controlled by a
        handful of "Mega-Corporations" around the globe in the near future.

    3.  NAVIGATING A DIFFERENT PATH
        Netscape Communications Corp. has announced the public release of
        the source code for its popular browser "Netscape Navigator."  The
        statement came as a shock to the industry, since Netscape declared
        losses for the fourth quarter of 1997.  Netscape officials say
        the company will now focus more upon server-specific applications.

    4.  CRYPTIC ENOUGH?
        Cryptologists and the government seem to be like oil and water these
        days.  At a conference this month, government officials, and
        Cryptologist experts gathered to discuss the issue of electronic
        security.  Experts say they have been able to crack 40-bit DES
        encryption within 40 seconds, and 56-bit within 2 weeks.  Big Brother
        is not allowing a 128-bit encryption method yet, and also requires
        that all cryptology algorithms submit a skeleton key so that FBI
        and other agencies can decrypt data to "catch criminals."  The
        matter has yet to be resolved.

    5.  NEW DOMAIN NAMES ARRIVING
        The expanding number of people and organizations on the net has
        created an enormous demand for more TLDs (top level domains).
        Existing ones, such as; .org, .com, .net, are not adequately enough
        providing the number of unique, relevant domain names that people
        want.  Seven new TLD's will be available this year; .FIRM for
        businesses, .SHOP for companies offering goods for sale, .WEB for
        organizations stressing web activity, .ARTS for cultural groups,
        .REC for entertainment, .INFO for informational services, and .NOM
        for personal web sites.  To be honest, I'm surprised they didn't add
        .XXX for the over abundance of porn sites on the net!

    6.  VIRUS WAR MUTATES
        With the ever increasing population of the internet, virus writers
        have been given a delightful 'test bed' for their malicious code.
        But the process of virus writing has changed a lot since its
        assembly language days.  Macro viruses are the hype these days,
        with an estimated 2000, up from 40 (2 years ago), and the ease at
        which they can be created is mind boggling.  Any user with MS Office
        installed can embed virus code in a macro, and distribute it via
        e-mail to thousands of victims.  Experts claim the problem could be
        totally eliminated if 30% of the world's computers were equipped with
        up-to-date anti-virus software. <g>

    7.  TERRA-SCALE COMPUTING
        Since IBM's Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov in a close chess tournament
        last year, the US Department of Energy, IBM, and three other
        companies are working on a computer 100 times stronger than any
        available today; the target date is 2001.  The computer will be
        used to predict earthquakes, replace current scientific computing
        methods, aid in drug design, CAD, and more.
        On the same note, Digital Equipment Corp broke the 1Ghz barrier
        this month, with their new 21264 Alpha chip.

    8.  CORPORATE DOWNSIZING HITS AST
        AST Canada has been hit hard by global competitive markets, and
        the need for efficient use of resources.  The company, which declared
        losses for the most part of 1997 has downsized its Canadian offices
        to one main office in Mississauga, leaving 20 people to do the work
        of 200.  Is AST on the way out?  Only time will tell.

    9.  Y2K ISSUES
        Despite the hype surrounding the "millennium bug," studies reveal 
        that this issue is not being followed up on.  At this time it is
        estimated that 50% of corporations are ignoring the problem.  Either
        hoping it will disappear, or a simple, quick, and cheap fix will
        become available in the near future.  This is not good enough for
        the government officials though, who are demanding that formal plans
        be submitted to ensure that lives are not lost, and people left
        stranded due to the date error.  Most important are hospitals,
        insurance companies, and other corporations who provide services
        necessary for survival in our current society.  It is undecided if 
        charges will be laid against companies who do not show proof of
        efforts to correct the bug.

   10.  WHEN GREED TAKES OVER
        Bell Canada once again shows its true colors in 1998.  Their thirst
        for money is horrendous.  Threatened by the amazing quality of
        internet long distance calls (Internet Phone, etc) and widespread
        use, Bell Canada has executed to my knowledge one public plan, and
        one 'not so public' plan to ensure profits, and kill competitors.
        The former entails buying out ISPs, and gaining a market control,
        after which raising prices for basic services.  The latter was not
        meant to be public knowledge, but the facts are evident.
        Companies that had produced Internet phone hardware and software
        technology were coerced into purposely reducing the quality of voice
        transmissions over the net.  The advertisement for such products
        has been verified to include the following sentence, "Quality of

THOUGHTS, POEMS AND CREATIVE WRITING -                            {WRITING}
CREATIVE THOUGHTS BY THE JOURNALIST:

Novelty and Habit are said to be two evolving forces within the 
Universe.  The formation of the new, in relation to the old.

The patterns which manifest themselves so obviously in our lives
Escape our innermost thoughts.

We are the needle in the haystack.  Yet we believe ourselves
To be the haystack itself.  

And this is the miracle we call life.  So intricate, so beautiful.
And yet so elusive. 

We attempt to repress natural processes that have existed since
The beginning of time.  We call this "progress".

What is progress?, but a fruitless journey away from ourselves.
Away from innate technology existing in our beings now.

How pathetic we must look, burying our heads in the sand to avoid
Looking at reality.  

The fragile reality that we believe is a "fluke", a chance event 
That created life.

Hardly.


CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Intense Closing Comments:

You have an opportunity to learn about h/p and progress.  However, it's your
responsibility to become actively involved, dedicated to learning how to hack,
phreak etc., gain knowledge and experience.  If you've made a conscious choice
to join the h/p scene, that's great.  If you aren't really interested in h/p,
then quit wasting other people's time and return to the warez scene.  If nobody
on h/p boards will answer your questions, don't criticize or blame them.  More
than likely it is your own fault.  Try to consider their position.  Think about
how many newbies are constantly asking them stupid questions.  Try to remember
how much information they've shared.  If an experienced h/per gives you advice
that proves to be useful, be grateful and appreciative.  Don't pretend to be
a "big hax0r" after they've given you a technique or whatever the case may be.
Basically, don't act like a wannabe... because you'll be despised, mocked, and
laughed at continually.  In my opinion, you deserve that type of treatment if
you foolishly try to pretend to be a hacker or phreak and you're neither.  ;)
Also, don't idolize someone, kiss ass, overly compliment them etc.  That's very
annoying, won't get you any credit and respect.  In fact, you'll probably be
labelled as being a lamer and won't be taken seriously ever again.  Don't try
to form your own wannabe "h/p group" either if you're a newbie.

The reason that I wrote this as the Closing Comments is because I want newbies
to realize that shit like that is unacceptable and not tolerated in the h/p
scene.  It is very unfortunate that many newbies act like ignorant lamers in
519.  Fortunately, it isn't that way in every area code.  The 519 h/p scene
needs to be reformed and evolve before it dies completely.  The solution isn't
extremely difficult.  Show respect towards those that have been in the scene
for years and made a valuable contribution towards it.  Don't make petty
insults and bash people's h/p abilities, skills, knowledge and experience that
you know nothing about.  Don't make stupid assumptions based on age or
"rumours that you've heard".  Try not to act like a total lamer.  Also, if
you're a newbie you can't fool any experienced people in the h/p scene into
thinking that you're not... so don't even attempt to do that.  It simply doesn't
work.  ;)  We really get a good laugh whenever a newbie tries to make up shit
and it's blatantly obvious.  Sometimes we even discuss them in Email and chats,
laughing heartily at their stupidity, arrogance and ignorance.  Haha.  So, avoid
doing that if you're a newbie.  It's the lamest thing you can do.

We're always looking for Writers, Members and Distribution Sites.  If you'd like
to apply to Damage, INC. and join a respected h/p group, then download a copy of
the Damage, INC. Application Generator.  If you want any of our releases, they
are currently available on the following boards:

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL - Damage, INC. WHQ, h/p/a/c/v/t, no ratios, invite only.
