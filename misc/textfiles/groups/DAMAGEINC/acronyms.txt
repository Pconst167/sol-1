Sources:
-------

This list was compiled over several months time and spans many areas of
interest (from telco terms to general/common computer terms).  Multiple sources
were used, including:  a list from Metal Shop Private BBS (as published in
Phrack), a list from PIMP issue #3, text files on specific networks, various
telco documents (Bell, AT&T, MCI) I've found and read, my own knowledge, and
from memory, etc.  It isn't a complete list by any means, but it's as complete
as it's ever going to be.  So, that's why I decided that I might as well release
it the way it is.  It was originally released at the end of 1998 in issue #13 of
the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  A few additions and minor changes have been made
to it since then.  I may decide to update it and release a new version sometime
in the distant future.  That is, if I have the time to type all of the acronyms
and definitions from various documents that I've obtained.  Gathering together
masses of loose papers that are strewn around is an undertaking in itself.

Final Notes:
-----------

Hopefully you find this small list of acronyms useful.  It was created to be
used mainly as a reference for terms that you might run across while exploring
systems, reading text files, looking through documents you found while trashing
or whatever.  :)
