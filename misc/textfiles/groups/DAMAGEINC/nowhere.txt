American Dreams:  Nowhere is Everywhere.

Wind whipping against old wooden barns and worn leaning fences.  Light snow
covered gravel country roads... crunching beneath bicycle tires awakens your
senses.  Brisk cool winter air striking your face... Quickening your pace.
Tree limbs weighted by ice and snow... bending.  Spirit is soaring and soul
mending.  Mixed emotions blending.  Mind and body... everything transcending.

Thoughts of music, poetry and paintings dancing in your head.  Often, that's
enough to sustain you.  Nothing need even be said.  Alone but content you ride.
Other times, you decide to skate... and over paved streets you gracefully glide.
Yet all the while, what you're doing is irrelevant.  It's what you *feel*
inside.  And so within, you find importance.  You find the meaning you so
desperately seek... realizing your strength... knowing you're not weak.

In the middle of nowhere, caught between crossroads and empty fields.
And you feel the pain inside of you...
So bright and true to your convictions.  If only you knew the power you wield.

Compassionate.  Significant beyond measure and you can't seem to see it.
Tragic yet modest.
Always seeking understanding.  Far beyond your years with intellect and wit.

Stranded in obscurity and isolation, yet so very open and free.
Filled with ideas.
Consumed by the pursuit of knowledge.  You need to know.  You need to be.

Wishing you were without pain.  Wishing everything were understandable.
Honest and loyal.
Trusting me with secrets, you chose to make yourself vulnerable.

Everything fades softly.  Night turns to day.
There you stand.
In silence... all of the sadness and tears wash away.

Maturing rapidly but dignified and with grace.
A lovely being.
Thoughts of quantum mechanics, science and the continuum of time-space.

Grasping hold of truth, firm beliefs and ideals you witness your own growth.
Developing and evolving.
With fragility and strength woven tightly together, so you can carry both.

Eyes on the crimson stream.  Mind focused on books and dreams.
Peaceful and without threat.
Extending a gentle hand to strangers, you're much more than you seem.

Looking well past the surface, delving deeper, I can see you for who you are.
Envision what you'll become.
Your imperfections are beautiful... All of you.  All of your scars.

So adorable and unique.  So much of an individual... tender and young.
Charming with wisdom.
Brilliantly bursting with potential.  So many tales and songs yet to be sung.

Exuding strength without fully realizing it, you strengthen and inspire.
Fortified and grateful for your presence.
I love your essence, and hope you're fulfilled.  Achieve all you desire.

- Dedicated to Karen.  I wrote this for you so that you'd realize how bright
and significant you are.  Beyond my perceptions there's you... a very
compassionate and loyal person of great worth.  ;)
