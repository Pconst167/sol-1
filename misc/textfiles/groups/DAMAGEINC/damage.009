INTRODUCTION:  The quote for this issue is "Search and Destroy".  It invokes
               many images and powerful thoughts.  What does it mean?
               Obviously, that depends upon your perspective.  It could mean
               strength, aggressiveness, destruction, damage, a merciless
               mission, evil, or war itself.  However, it could also mean
               something quite different from that.  The above quote might mean
               searching out and destroying ignorance, misinformation and false
               assumptions.  Indeed, there's more than one possible meaning.
               You just have to open your mind to the many possibilities that
               exist.

               The intended meaning is to fight ignorance and destroy the
               misinformation that surrounds us.  To say that it's a difficult
               task is an understatement.  I'll admit that I'm not optimistic.
               I'm a realist by nature and cannot fathom what's involved in
               accomplishing that goal.  I realize that it will take years of
               dedication and diligent work to even make a small impression
               upon the ignorant masses that have been mislead and misinformed
               by the media, Big Brother etc.  I also know that no matter how
               much time and effort is expended, a single individual can't
               make a significant difference.  That is, they can't do it alone.
               That's the reason that I'm calling upon you, the readers of
               the Damage, INC. Newsletter to unite, exchange information and
               ideas and contribute towards a common goal.  Our mission is to
               inform and educate.  We cannot rely on anyone else but ourselves.

               "The system" is structured to teach you what *they* want you to
               know and nothing more.  It has failed us all.  It doesn't provide
               you with the means to attain wisdom and gain knowledge.  In fact,
               it is setup to prevent you from thinking freely and learning
               about what interests you.  They control the material that you
               study and absorb.  They set the standards, the rules and test you
               on what you're supposed to know.  Meaning, you're instructed to
               memorize certain material and then regurgitate it back to them
               later on.  It's almost like a feedback loop.  In reality, it's
               a trap.  Don't be ashamed if you walked right into it due to your
               own naiveness.  Many people have fallen into the same trap and
               become prey.  The main problem is that most never escaped and
               they're currently zombies.  As in, they do not possess the simple
               ability to think freely, examine things and then form their own
               opinions.  They are the true failures in "society".  They've
               failed themselves.  Most importantly, they didn't learn the hard
               way from their mistake.  The zombies assume that they were told
               the truth and defiantly reject learning the real truth.

               What can I do about it?  That's a rhetorical question that is
               often spoken by zombies.  They don't want a reply, the answer,
               nor do they wish to think and find a solution.  Basically, they
               don't want to do anything about whatever problem they're
               indirectly referring to.  In comparison to an enlightened person,
               a zombie is a sub-human, brainwashed, creature that is a slave
               to "society".  Their only duty is to serve it.  That is all that
               really concerns them.  I've witnessed the ignorant, influenced,
               government loyal, Big Brother loving, brainwashed, sickening
               actions of zombies too many times.  They are not only illogical,
               but also the most limited, controlled, puppets imaginable.  Their
               lack of thought prevents them from ever evolving and achieving
               enlightenment.  They are the epitome of thoughtlessness and the
               best followers that can be found.  The only logical answer to
               their question is that they can do nothing about anything.  At
               least, not without changing their state of mind and entire being.
               The zombies view is the accepted view of "society".  To change
               that is to change everything including their very consciousness.

               The main point that I want to express is to warn everyone not
               to become a zombie.  If you can think then you can do something.
               If you can learn then you can teach.  If you can share ideas and
               information then you can make a positive difference.  Don't just
               take it.  Don't just ignore what is happening.  Don't just give
               up and quit.  Don't just surrender and let the ignorant of
               "society" win.  The battle against ignorance must be waged now if
               things are going to change.  If you think that it's possible to
               improve something, then make an attempt.  As an example, it could
               be your local h/p scene.  Or, you could search out and destroy
               articles of misinformation that you've seen being spread around.
               In any case, you'd be doing something that's beneficial instead
               of asking "What can I do about it?" repeatedly to no avail.  The
               zombies will absolutely support the Thought Police, restrictions
               on privacy, the elimination of civil rights and freedom for
               "reasons of safety".  Many of those things are already slipping
               away from our grasp.  Don't allow it to continue.  Think about
               that while you are still allowed to think freely...


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Big Brother will brand his cattle.

In the book "1984", George Orwell described a ruthless totalitarian state in
which the actions and thoughts of its citizens were carefully tracked.  Many
people agree that Orwell was an exceptional author.  However, most people assume
that an Inner Party could not have such control over a society.  I disagree with
that.  Orwell was an amazing man that was able to accurately predict what our
world will be like in the future.  The only limitation for Orwell was that he
wasn't able to fully predict the monumental advances in technology since 1949.

Orwell's prophetic book, to which we owe the title of this section of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter, also leads me into what many people consider true
prophesy.  The Book of Revelation.  Yes, there are some very disturbing
prophesies in there, but there is one that I would like to focus on.  Revelation
13 (16-17) states, "And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads;
"And that no man might buy or sell, save that he had the mark, or the name of
the beast, or the number of his name."  These verses refer to the Mark of the
Beast, Satan's number 666, etc.

Orwell's prediction of people being carefully watched by a vast network of
Thought Police, and Bible prophesy regarding the Mark of the Beast are
dangerously close to becoming a reality.  For approximately a decade, Big
Brother has possessed the technology necessary to implant humans with biochip
transponders.  Once these chips are implanted, Big Brother can use his
satellites to track the victim's movements.

The biochip transponders are implanted within a human via a syringe.  It is
place just under the skin of the subject.  It can be placed anywhere... like
under the skin of your forehead, or on the back of one of your hands.  The
approximate size of the implantable biochip transponder is a grain of rice.
Once it is implanted, it is virtually impossible to remove.  

The biochip transponder emits low frequency FM radio waves.  These FM radio
waves are powerful enough to reach an orbiting satellite several miles up.
The satellite can then be used to surmise the exact position of the implanted
person.  Big Brother can then discover latitude, longitude and elevation of the
person branded by their transponder.

Implanted biochip transponders technology has been used for over a decade.
Especially in the United States, there are many domestic animals that have been
implanted with biochips.  InfoPet, a southern California company, was the first
to get involved in injecting biochip transponders into cats and dogs.  Companies
like InfoPet have exploited the rampant fears of pet owners in order to implant
as many biochip transponders as possible.  

Worse yet, in the mid 1990s, a company called KIDSCAN attempted to prey upon the
fears of guilty, fearful parents when they offered a program to inject children
with biochip transponders.  Children "enrolled" in KIDSCAN would be tracked down
and their coordinates would be immediately sent to the local police department.
KIDSCAN's angle relied on the public's misconception that child abductions were
running rampant.  Another angle was when the KIDSCAN children become teenagers,
parents that do not trust their children can use the transponder to track down
their "rebellious teenagers".

Of course, parents were too busy living in fear to think that they were
injecting a foreign device into their children's body that could not be removed.
These parents were so scared of losing their possession... err, child, that they
were willing to sacrifice their child/children's freedom of movement
permanently.  People just don't think.

Luckily, KIDSCAN founder Jack Dunlap's plans were finished, when funding for his
Big Brother inspired idea was eliminated in the prototype stage.  However, that
was back in 1989.  In those days, people cared more about their independence and
individuality than they do these days.  There is no doubt in my mind (and
judging by the research I've done, many others) that Big Brother has the
technology in the ready, and a plan to get the dupes out there to WANT the
biochip implant.

There are also other reasons (excuses) that Big Brother is publicly whirling
around to people that are standing up against the implanted biochip
transponders.  The loudest one that Big Brother yells is well used "stop crime
at the cost of all civil rights and liberties" propaganda.  That includes
convicted criminals, and suspects that are awaiting trial, and get bail.  Big
Brother would love to place a permanent biochip transponder into that person,
the excuse being "they might jump bail".  (Even if the suspect is released
because he is innocent, he must live a life sentence under the unending
surveillance of Big Brother.)  Other recommended implant victims are the
disabled (mentally and physically), poor people ("they might defraud the welfare
system"), Altzheimers patients, and "dissidents" that stand against Big Brother.

Big Brother knows how to dupe people.  Step by step, Big Brother introduces new
technologies that make it easier for him to track people's financial and
physical movements.  These days credit and debit cards are more popular than
ever.  In the November 1997 issue #3 of the Damage, INC. Newsletter, Shatazar
wrote an article on smart cards.  That is another, more intrusive step.  A step
after financial smart cards, are all-in-one cards that contain not only
financial data, but all civic data as well (driver's licence, tax information,
health information/history, etc.)  There has been discussion in the United
States regarding a National ID card.  Once that is implemented by Big Brother,
people will lose their cards, and be screwed because of it.  As in Revelation
13, they won't be able to buy or sell.  Big Brother will suggest a solution to
lost or (intentionally?) damaged "smart" all-in-one cards by offering biochip
implants.  Big Brother will spew out so much propaganda, that the sheep will be
lining up to be branded with the mark of Big Brother (the Beast?).

What would happen if he commanded all hospitals and birthing centres to inject
new born babies with the biochip transponder?  It is impossible for the parents
to protect their newborn when he/she is removed from the birthing room almost
after birth.  What would happen if there was a mandatory inoculation, but the
injection is some saline solution and Big Bro's tracking chip?  Once Big Brother
acts, a full generation will be tracked from birth until death.  Every moment of
life can be documented and examined.  It is easily within Big Brother's
resources to do this.  All he is waiting for is the mindless cattle to line up
to be branded.  Is that what you want?  To live knowing that Big Brother is
watching, and will severely punish you if you do something that is "politically
incorrect" or "illegal"?  If you go with the grain, and tolerate Big Brother's
actions of oppression, say "MOOOOO".  :(

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Tips on Dumpster Diving and Trashing:

This is the incomplete guide to trashing for NNNs (novices, neophytes and
newbies).  Hey, I just invented a new abbreviation!  :)  This article will
cover the basics that you'll need to know.  It's more like an overview, a
beginner's guide or "Trashing 101".  I've divided it into the following
sections:

Section 1.  How to avoid getting noticed and caught trashing.
Section 2.  Where the good dumpsters can usually be found.
Section 3.  What things to search for that are worth keeping.


Section 1:  How to avoid getting noticed and caught trashing.
---------   -------------------------------------------------

Have you ever seen those big steel dumpsters outside of large buildings before?
They're usually at the back or along the side and usually have something like
"BFI" (on the blue dumpsters written in white lettering) or "Big Bear" (on the
brown dumpsters, sometimes with their little bear logo on it).  They're fairly
easy to spot and find at places, due to their size.  You should go trashing at
night, and make sure you look around for cameras first at the location.  Also,
it's a good idea to use a very small flashlight (such as a pen light) that's
discreet and can be concealed in your pocket easily if needed.  Plus, don't
bring along a large group of people.  It's too conspicuous and only increases
your chances of being noticed by someone like a cop or security guard.  If you
do go trashing in a group, don't talk too loudly or make a lot of noise while
sorting through junk.  Take a shopping cart along, and fill it with cardboard,
junk from the first dumpster, bottles, cans, old clothing etc.  Wear some really
old, dirty, torn up, ripped clothes (as in, jeans and a t-shirt) and try to look
like you're a homeless street person.  Most people will avoid you and cops
probably won't harass you if they assume you're just collecting bottles and
cans.  ;)  Make sure you have a car parked nearby in case you need to make a
quick getaway.  Just don't park it right beside the dumpster or anything, since
that'd expose your license plate number.  The vehicle should be within running
distance on a route that won't take you through well lit areas.  You may want to
carry some garbage bags filled with receipts, documents, binders, manuals or
discarded computer hardware back to the car, and it'd look very obvious if you
were running a long distance with your arms filled with things like that.  So,
place them into a backpack or use the shopping cart.  Hide it underneath
cardboard and garbage bags.  A better way is to have someone drop you off, park
and wait in the car at a secluded location and return later at the appointed
time to pick you up.  It's less suspicious that way and you won't have to walk
around on the streets pushing a grocery cart filled with whatever you acquired
in your trashing treasure hunt.  ;)

You should also do some research first.  It'll benefit you tremendously later
on if you find out if the intended target dumpsters are monitored by cameras,
security guards etc.  Find out when the businesses are closed and go there
during the hours that nobody else will be around.  To make your expedition safe
and phun, sort through the trash somewhere private (like inside of a garage)
instead of at the actual site.  If someone on the street (like an ordinary
citizen) asks you what you're doing, just reply "I'm collecting and recycling
what big businesses throw away." then cough, spit and smile at them.  They'll
probably be happy to hear that reason and shouldn't bother you after that.
Never try to explain what you're really doing.  If the lamer persists, act like
you're an insane, deranged madman by talking to yourself and looking around
wildly for no apparent reason.  That'll get rid of the nosy bastard for sure.
Just don't get spoofed by any questions that they may ask.  If you're too
paranoid about getting caught, chances are you will forget to take the necessary
steps, precautions and plan everything out carefully.  Therefore, you shouldn't
even attempt to go trashing as you'll only end up frozen like a deer staring
into the bright light of a cop's flashlight.  Fear and paranoia can be your
worst enemies... especially in relation to stealthful trashing.


Section 2:  Where the good dumpsters can usually be found.
---------   ---------------------------------------------

At this point, you should know what a dumpster looks like and have some ideas
on how to avoid getting detected and caught trashing.  But before you dive in,
you'll need to know where to find the "good dumpsters".  That is, the ones
that will provide you with some useful information, hardware or anything else
that's interesting for that matter.  I'll give you a few locations to start
dumpster diving at, but it's up to you to do some research and look around.
If you're observant and keep your eyes open, you can find out many things
such as when the garbage is picked up at local businesses (in medium/large
cities it's usually scheduled), what information they have and what type of
stuff they throw out.  This information is crucial to know as you don't want
to spend hours trashing and return with nothing.  There's absolutely nothing
worse than time that's been wasted for no reason other than ignorance.  So,
become informed about the targets, narrow down your search to specific things
that you want and pick a few victim dumpsters.  Once you've done that and
chosen some sites, plan and map everything out so that your first night of
trashing goes as smoothly as possible.

So, where are these "good dumpsters" located?  The first place to check out
is your local CO (Central Office).  Even though it should be obvious what
type of material can be found there, it will still be explained in the next
section.  Some other good places to go trashing are at computer stores, stereo
shops, large office buildings (especially for PBX information, employee lists
and anything else that can be used for h/p or social engineering purposes),
retail stores/outlets, gas stations, banks, car dealerships, cellular phone
retailers, and malls etc.  Stay away from the food court (fast food) dumpsters
though, unless you want to wear gloves and be up to your waist in greasy shit.
They're too messy and usually don't yield anything that's useful.

Just watch out for security guards, cameras, and cops patrolling the parking
lots, alleys etc.  This especially applies to banks, large stores, telco COs,
and of course malls.  Some large office buildings might have their own security
hired to patrol at night as well.  So, do a little research first and be
careful about who's around and watching.  Scouting the location during the
day and looking for hidden cameras outside (mounted on light stands, the actual
building, above doors etc.) is always a wise move.


Section 3:  What things to search for that are worth keeping.
---------   ------------------------------------------------

It all depends upon what you want.  If you want telco documents, manuals,
notebooks, binders, trashed/broken equipment, reports, printouts, and perhaps
some lists (consisting of acronyms, employees, codes, numbers etc.)

I'm not going to tell you where to look for lists of CC #s.  If you want to
find and use them, then you're on your own.  This article isn't meant for
K0d3z Kidz.  ;)

If you want computer hardware, then try finding some dumpsters that are behind
computer stores or large retail stores that sell all types of electronics
equipment.  Sometimes the larger office buildings throw away old monitors,
motherboards, cases, hard drives etc. too.

If you want computer software, then don't bother dumpster diving to look for
it.  Call a local warez board, ask a warez pup or check out some warez ftp
sites if you want to be a warez d00d.  ;)

Look for anything else that you think *might* prove to be useful.  That includes
information that you can later use to social engineer a business, gain access
to their systems, use their PBX, VMB etc.  Just use your imagination and common
sense to determine what is worth keeping and what isn't.

In conclusion, I hope the tips and techniques discussed will be beneficial
to our readers.  If you do get caught trashing, the most that'll probably
happen is them charging you with trespassing.  So, it's only a minor offense.
Don't bring any illegal weapons, burglary tools etc. with you, or you could be
charged with a major offense.  You should avoid carrying any ID with you in
case something happens.  Also, despite what I've written you still might be
surprised at what you can find in the trash.  ;)  Here's a little trashing
humour.  Enjoy...

Other names for Trashing:

"Dumpster Diving, Trashcan jumping, Digging for Docs, Sliming, Recycling,
 Antiquing, Salvaging, Collecting, Scavenging, Impersonating the homeless."

Dumpster Dive rating scale:

1/10  - You fall into the dumpster by accident, break your neck and drown while
        face down in over 100 gallons of slime and rotting vegetables.  To say
        the least nobody is impressed, not even the coroner.
2/10  - You're thrown into a dumpster with a garbage bag tied over your head and
        suffocate to death.  Your body isn't found.  The landfill/dump becomes
        your final resting place.
3/10  - You jump into a dumpster and then realize it's filled with disgusting,
        stinking, decomposing fast food.  The horrible stench makes you sick
        and you puke enough to fill a garbage bag, although most of it lands
        on your shoes.  If that weren't bad enough, a small fire is started in
        the dumpster by some old lighters.  Luckily you avoid getting burned.
        Then a cop arrives on the scene.  He charges you with arson and
        trespassing to add insult to injury.  You feel extremely foolish.
4/10  - A friend challenges you to leap into a dumpster from the roof of a
        building.  You stupidly oblige and break both of your legs when you
        land.  You cry out in pain and ask for help.  Then you realize that the
        dumpster contained some old batteries.  Some of them were crushed and
        broken open by your "leap of faith" and the battery acid was splashed
        on your clothes.  It's starting to dissolve your jeans and sting your
        legs.  Your friend helps you out and takes you to the hospital and they
        ask "What the hell happened to you?"  You make up a lame story in an
        attempt to explain your injuries.  You're embarrassed and feel like a
        complete idiot.  Other patients in the emergency room mock and laugh
        at you.
5/10  - You dive in head first and sink to the bottom of the dumpster.  Other
        people witness it and laugh at your "dumpster headstand".  Your friends
        never let you forget about the now infamous "drunken faceplant into a
        half empty dumpster incident."  You're humiliated for life.
6/10  - You climb in expertly.  However, as you're digging around inside of the
        dumpster the lid slams closed on your head with a thud.  Then someone
        that's walking down the alley locks it shut with a padlock.  ;)
7/10  - You step into the dumpster like a pro.  You find some useful "trash"
        sitting right on the top.  Everything is going great until you notice
        your shoes are soaked.  The soaker ruins your new $150 pair of shoes
        that you shouldn't have been wearing out trashing in the first place.
8/10  - You show off by doing a backflip into the dumpster.  Everyone that's
        with you is impressed by your athletic ability and finesse.  However,
        your car keys fall out and it takes you 30 minutes looking through
        trash to find them in.  Eventually, you find the keys sitting on top
        of a fairly new telco manual with lists and other documents beside it.
9/10  - You pick a great night to go trashing.  You find a dumpster that's
        filled with clean documents, manuals, notebooks etc. and dive right
        in.  You look down at the papers and at your feet is the very list that
        you were just saying to your friends that you wanted to have.
10/10 - You find the "perfect dumpster", dive in, and within ten minutes you
        have managed to collect and gather together everything that you were
        looking for... including valuable hardware and telco information that
        is very difficult to acquire.  Overall, it's the perfect dumpster dive.

CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
NWO Part 1:  Basic Introduction.

What is the New World Order (NWO)?  Is it more than a meaningless phrase that
George Bush said during the Persian Gulf War?  Or is it something more?  Well,
I'm telling you that it is much more than the name of a group of WCW wrestlers.
;-)  Seriously though, if you haven't had the ambition or opportunity to learn
about the New World Order, you do not know about the greatest conspiracy that
threatens our freedom.  In this article, it is my intention to give those of you
enough information about the NWO so that you are no longer totally in the dark.
I feel that it is critically important that everyone learns what is happening
now... so that we aren't caught by surprise by our enemies.  If you have already
researched the NWO topic, you may want to skip this article now, and read it
after you have enjoyed the rest of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  :-)

The first question you could be thinking right now is what is the New World
Order?  The New World Order is the restructuring of the political, economic, and
social structures of the world towards a one world government.  This world
government will have control over all countries, and membership in the NWO will
be mandatory.  The world government will only serve the interests of a small
group of extremely rich and powerful people that are members of elite globalist
groups.  The rest of us will be used for labour.

There are quite a few groups that are very secretly working towards one world
government that they intend pull the strings of.  Below I will list various
groups and give you basic information on each.  The members of these groups are
extremely rich, and influential in their own fields.  When they meet, they do so
to shape the world for their own benefit.  And what benefits them the most is to
find ways to control us.  

Illuminati:  The Illuminati was formed in the 1700s (I saw the date May 1, 1776
in several articles I've read, but obviously I can't confirm it) by German
professor Adam Weishaupt.  Modern day conspiracy analysts believe the purpose of
this "secret society" was to fund each other in their conspiracies and plans for
world domination.  Skeptics believe this group was formed by free thinkers
trying to make Europe into a more loving, tolerant place.  I personally believe
it was the former.  The current day Illuminati want to make the world a better
place for themselves.  The most powerful and noteworthy modern Illuminati are
powermongers like Rockefeller, Rothschild, Carnagie, and so on.

Bilderberg:  The first Bilderberg meeting was held during 1954 in the Bilderberg
Hotel in Oosterbeek, Holland.  The delegates that attend the Bilderberg Meeting
are referred to as Bilderbergers.  Bilderberg Members are from North America or
Europe.  It is because of the Bilderberg that the groundwork for the European
Union was laid.  Their goal, like the other groups is to weaken nationalism in
favour of a globalist system ruled by the elite.

Council on Foreign Relations:  The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) was
founded in 1921 with the help of the Rockefellers.  The CFR is an American
elitist organization that was modelled after the British Royal Institute on
International Affairs.  Members are a who's who of the American elite.
Virtually all high ranking politicians are members, as well as the elite in
fields such as the media, bureaucracies, telecommunications, science, academics,
business and industry leaders, banking/high finance, oil/energy companies, and
the military.  With such a collection of influential people, it is not
unreasonable to think that the CFR could act as the United States' secret
government.  Its objective is the implementation of the New World Order.  After
all, the CFR was the force behind the creation of the United Nations after World
War II.

The Trilateral Commission:  The Trilateral Commission was formed in 1973 by
David Rockefeller.  Members of the Trilateral Commission live in one of three
world zones; North America, Western Europe, and Japan (Asia).  The objective of
this group is to promote free movement of transnational currency by eliminating
the economic sovereignty of individual nations.  Like the CFR, the Trilateral
Commission members' backgrounds are diverse.  It is disturbing to note that
every U.S. President since Jimmy Carter is a member of the Trilateral
Commission.

There are other NWO-driven groups and meeting places for the Illuminati, but
these are the believed to be the pulse of the New World Order.  Again I mention
that the Illuminati, through subgroups like the CFR and the Trilateral
Commission have taken control of every important governmental post, and have
members and sympathizers in every critical corporate and academic position.
Now that I have given you a basic introduction to the globalist elite and their
groups involved in the New World Order, I will discuss some of their
philosophies, and what they have been doing to bring them into being.

As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, the NWO a restructuring of the
political, economic, and social structures of the world.  Obviously if you can
control all three structures, you control the world.  That is what the elite
bastards have been doing for decades now.  Even today, we are feeling the
effects of their work. 

Economic Restructuring

I will begin with how the global elitists have changed the economic structure to
benefit their ultimate goal.  The reason I begin here is because the changes are
extremely evident once they thought about and examined.  Look at what has
changed since the beginning of this century.  There has been many economic
unions and free trade agreements occurring all over the world.  From GATT
(Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) to the European Community, to NAFTA, it
has all happened in the past 20 years.  In this time, sovereign control over
trade has been changed to free trade under the international rules.  There is no
doubt that the economic restructuring of the world economy and world trade
benefit elitist groups like the Trilateral Commission.
  
It is sickening that a one world economic system is virtually in place.  The
European Union has progressed to the point where the currency of member states
has been eliminated in favour of one supranational currency.  In the Western
Hemisphere, North America already has a free trade agreement, and there are
plans to have a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas by the year 2005 at the
latest.  There are also negotiations occurring in Asia and Oceania as they
attempt to hammer out a free trade agreement and economic union in that part of
the world.  Don't be fooled by the collapse of Indonesia and other Asian
countries, that is of little consequence to the plans of the globalists.

Not only do they earn unimaginable profits, but *they* have set the rules and
hold the power of the economic world order.  Obviously, that's the whole point.
:-(  They have the influence to create their own recessions and depressions.  In
fact, some knowledgable researchers believe that the CFR, under the guidance of
the Rockefellers, Rothschilds, and others engineered the 1929 stock market
crash.

Why would they do something like that?  Economic restructuring.  The depression
drove many nations, including the United States, into debt.  And of course the
families I listed above gained control of the U.S. economy because they hold a
debt that the United States of America will not be able to repay.  To quote
Mayer Amschel Rothschild, "Give me control over a nation's currency, and I care
not who makes its laws."  He said these words in the early 1800s, before his
death in 1812.  That should give you some idea as to how long the Illuminati
have been manipulating and restructuring economic systems for their own
purposes.

Political Restructuring

Because the economic structure of the world is dominated by the Illuminati, they
have tremendous influence over the political happenings within countries,
particularly "western" nations like the United States and Canada.  The global
elite have been successful in creating a political organization to further
their goals to create a one world government that operates under their thumb.
I am referring to the United Nations.

The United Nations is the result of the global elite taking advantage of a war
weary world after the end of World War II.  Publicly touted as an organization
to "stop future wars", representatives from most nations met in San Francisco to
create a new world organization after the death of the League of Nations.  This
conference began on April 26, 1945.  On June 26, 1945, the conference ended with
the creation of the UN Charter.  

It was known from the very beginning what the global elite plans were.  The
United Nations is to be the world government, above all other sovereign nations.
In fact, the Chicago Tribune had a sickening headline in their August 6, 1946
issue.  "Radicals, Rich Unite to Push World State; Fight Defenders of US
Sovereignty."  There is other, more subtle evidence that the elite were a force
behind the creation of the United Nations.  In 1950, it was the Rockefellers
that donated the land in New York where the UN Headquarters now stands.  Greedy
globalists like the Rockefellers don't give prime real estate away unless they
plan on getting a payoff later on.

The reason why the UN's predecessor, the League of Nations, failed was because
the United States Congress killed potential U.S. membership.  This time, the
leaders of the NWO conspiracy decided that things would be different.  The CFR,
as well as the CFR controlled U.S. State Department used propaganda and other
tactics to influence the U.S. Congress and the American people to embrace the
UN, even at the cost of control over their own affairs of state.  

Obviously, the CFR was successful.  The United States joined the United Nations
when they signed the charter.  At that moment, the globalists rejoiced.  It
didn't take them long to test the power in the United Nations either.  In 1950,
the UN decided that they would force member nations like the United States to
send their men and women to Korea for a "policing operation."  American and
Canadian soldiers died wearing the uniform of the United Nations.  You may also
have heard of a conflict in Vietnam.  That conflict was escalated by the United
Nations.

Over 50 years after the charter was signed, the United Nations is being
restructured.  It is my personal prediction that early in the next millennium,
the UN will have more than just an assembly of representatives.  It will be a
world assembly, complete with a world court.  It will have the power to tax, to
create laws that all nations must obey, and more.  Basically, the structure of
the UN will be similar to the structure the European Union operates under.  The
only difference is that the UN will not have to respect the sovereignty of its
"member states."  The UN itself will also have a military that will be under
their direct control.  That includes a nuclear weapons arsenal.

The UN is only a small portion of the political restructuring the global elite
have been accomplishing around the world.  However, I decided to focus on the UN
because it is what the world government will be.  In the next issue of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter, I will reveal to you some UN conspiracies, and how they
relate to the New World Order.

Social Restructuring

This is the most frightening part of the NWO because it affects all the people
that believe in "society" directly.  After all, the leaders of the globalist
movement don't care about "society."  "Society" to them is a flock of ignorant
sheep to be coddled or exploited, depending on the circumstances of their plans
at that particular moment.  What angers me the most is that the globalists are
giving the zombies exactly what they want.  Zombies don't want to think for
themselves... they want those that they view as intelligent and superior to do
the thinking for them.  It is the apathetic attitude of the zombies in "society"
that has lead to what I believe to be the final steps in implementing the New
World Order I have described in this article.

It is because the vast majority of citizens in the last few generations have
given their ownership of their sovereign nations to internationalist bankers,
and politicians (their allies).  They have been able to easily restructure the
political and economic portions of almost all "western" nations, like the United
States, Canada, Europe, etc.  What I am driving at is that those that are
forming the NWO have taken what the zombies (the majority) have given them, and
then proceeded to use that power against all of us.

The social restructuring has been accepted time and time again.  The NWO
conspirators put the screws to "society" by changing something, then the zombies
tolerate the change.  Some changes could be the elimination of civil rights,
economic policy that cause massive unemployment, and so on.  These changes only
benefit the elite, and entrench the NWO even further.

As you learn more about the NWO, you should be extremely conscious that they
have been working on their plans for many years.  There are plans that haven't
even been unleashed upon us yet, yet the groundwork was laid decades ago.  I
plan on going into deeper detail in regards to the NWO social restructuring
plans/conspiracies that have, and possibly will occur in a future article.

This article marks the beginning of a series about the NWO that will be in the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  If you haven't read anything about the New World Order
previously, I hope that this very basic introduction has helped you.  I have
tried to keep it simple for you.  There is a lot of information that I was
unable to include.  Therefore, I encourage you to seek out as much information
and opinions regarding the New World Order as you possibly can.  The Internet
contains a tremendous amount of different viewpoints, as well as NWO booklists.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Slave labour in America's prisons.

It doesn't take a genius to realize that prisons are on of the booming
industries within North America.  More and more government monies are being
"invested" into the prison system.  It is interesting to know that the state of
California spends more money on prisons than it does on education.  Most people
may think that prisons are a financial drain on governments... but that has
changed with the evolvement of prison industries.  Prison industries have been
around for decades.  In its crudest form, it is the infamous chain gangs that
remove trash and other debris from the ditches along highways.  There is also a
stereotype of prisoners manufacturing road signs and licence plates in a
basement factory connected to the prison.  In those days, prison industries like
that were only allowed to work like slaves for the benefit of the government.
However, in the modern era where the emotion of greed is paramount, and corrupt
practices are an effective end to those means, things have definitely changed
within prison industries.

Especially in the United States, prison industries are expanding and evolving at
a ferocious rate.  In an attempt to make prisons "more profitable," prison
industries are actually starting to undercut and eliminate private sector
manufacturing, driving companies and law-abiding taxpayers out of work.  In
fact, some wardens are trying to influence corrupt, fat cat companies to use
domestic prison factories as a cheap source of labour, instead of foreign
(Asian, Mexican, etc.) labour.

Prison industries usually comprise of the manufacturing of products such as
furniture, textiles, and other small products.  For example, in Dane County,
Wisconsin at the Oakhill Correctional Institute there is a typical dank,
basement factory in which inmates work 40 hours a week manufacturing office
chairs and other furniture.  In 1995, Badger State Industries, which runs the
prison industry within Wisconsin, made $1.2 million in profit.  The average wage
for these inmates ranged from twenty cents to $1.50 per hour.  Fifteen
percent of their gross wages was taken by the prison system in addition to
the profit made by the state of Wisconsin.  At these horrid, unfair wage levels
private industry cannot compete as prison industries continue to expand.
Economic forecasts released by the Correctional Industries Association in the
United States predicts that 30 percent of America's inmates will produce
approximately $9 billion in sales by the year 2000.  Nine billion dollars
that should have been used for the employment of the working class.  Even worse
than that, cheaper goods and higher profit levels are earned by those greedy fat
cats that buy and sell these goods produced by this form of slave labour.

Private corporations are rejoicing at the prospects of using (abusing) inmates
to manufacture cheap goods/supplies for their operations.  In the state of
Oregon, which in 1995 passed a constitutional amendment which forces *all* state
inmates to work, have their enslaved work force in prison industries producing
uniforms for McDonald's, jeans for Kmart and JC Penney, and rocking ponies
(which sold for $80 in 1995) for the trendy Eddie Bauer stores.  These
special orders from the above corporations are in addition to the staple
products like furniture, mattresses, computer circuit boards, etc.

Manufacturing is a huge part of the prison industries and their incarcerated
slaves, but that is not all that inmates are doing.  They are forced to do
clerical services as well.  Inmates are plopped in front of a computer and are
expected to perform data entry, and other data processing tasks.  Youth
offenders in California were "hired" by TWA.  The youths' tasks included taking
credit card information from TWA customers, as well as other personal
information.  Prison industries were embarrassed on quite a few occasions when
some youths used the credit information obtained from TWA customers for their
own purposes.  It is unfortunate that innocent people suffered, and not TWA for
their decision to save a few bucks on the backs of their customers.

There is currently only one force that has had some success in battling the
proliferation of prison industries.  Labour unions.  In 1992, Weastec
Corporation used Ohio inmates to manufacture parts for Honda.  The inmates
earned 35 cents an hour from the state of Ohio.  Meanwhile, the inmates'
slavemasters received $2.05 per hour from Weastec.  The United Auto Workers
fought against this corrupt practice because it threatened "union jobs even more
than cheap parts imported under NAFTA," said UAW Region 2 Director Warren Davis.
The UAW received assistance from a Ohio State Representative, and several bills
were drafted to ban prisons from taking jobs away from private sector civilians.
Although the bill died in the Ohio Senate, Honda backed down due to negative
publicity, breathing a sigh of relief that no laws were past to stop their
depraved acts of greed in the future.

Another corrupt practice the U.S. is engaging is that they are exporting the
prison made goods overseas.  At the same time the United States bashed Communist
China for doing exactly the same thing.  The U.S. Federal law (which is
obviously not enforced) which prohibits domestic commerce in prison made goods
unless inmates are paid "prevailing wage."  However, to save greedy prison
operators from joining their slave workforce, the law conveniently exempts goods
produced for export.  American prisoners working in prison factories are thought
of the same way as Chinese prisoners, and cheap, abused Asian and Mexican
labour.  It is also sickening that the United States and Communist China use the
same excuse to justify making their prisoners work like slaves.  To quote a
Chinese warden, "We want prisoners to learn a working skill."

Working skills?  They learn obsolete skills that are only useful in prison
industries because private sector manufacturing industries are being wiped out
by very low labour costs from within their own communities.  All prison
industries prepares them for is to resume their slave labour when they are
convicted of a crime after release.  How can it be any other way when there
are no jobs out there for them?  Obviously, only the fat cats that run the
prisons (whether it is government or corporately operated) and those that
exploit the slave labour the inmates provide.

Although the U.S. Government claims that their prisoners willingly volunteer, it
is clear that there is only one logical choice.  If a prisoner chooses not to
`volunteer' to work in the prison industry, he is threatened.  Punishments
include the loss of canteen privileges, and worse the inmate is considered to be
"behaving badly" so there will be no time off for good behaviour.  In some
prisons, it has been reported that some men were put into solitary confinement
for refusing to become slaves within industrial prisons.

What has been evolving within the United States is growing in other
industrialized nations as well.  Prison industry gives them little third world
city-states in which prisoners are exploited for the benefit of extremely low
labour costs.  As more and more prisons are built, more inmates will be forced
into slave labour, and more jobs in the private sector will be lost.  That will
lead to greater unemployment within the working class, which will lead to more
people forced to perform criminal acts in order to survive.  That will send more
people to prison.  Prisons will fill up, and more prisons will need to be built.
This cycle is neverending.  The only winners are the greedy manufacturers and
prison industry operators that take advantage of domestic slave labour.

DRUGS DISCUSSION -                                                  {DRUGS}
A Case for Legalization:

First, I want to dispel a few common myths.  Hemp and Marijuana aren't the
same.  The two plants may look similar to each other on the surface but they
are very different.  The colour and shape of their leaves is misleading to some
people.  There are also certain people that *want* you to be mislead and remain
misinformed.  Damage, INC. wants you to become informed about this issue.  Thus,
I've decided to start this article with some facts and information.

You can smoke Hemp and you won't get high.  The reason is that Hemp contains no
THC.  Without THC, it's not a drug.  That is what separates it from Marijuana.
Just because two things appear to be alike, doesn't mean that they are the same.
Always remember that.  Also, Hemp is a very useful plant.  It can be used to
make many products and certain companies have recently started to discover its
usefulness.  For example, the luxury car maker Mercedes uses Hemp in the seats
of some of their cars now.  Adidas produces running shoes made from Hemp.  It
can be used in clothing, shoes, shampoo, foods like pizza etc. (Yes, Hemp seeds
are edible and quite tasty).  That's not all though, it provides strong fibres
for ropes and industrial products.  It can also be used to manufacture paper
products.  The oil from Hemp seeds is also being used in various products.  It's
been reported that there are over 25,000 products that can be made from
industrial hemp.  The possible uses are almost endless for this amazing plant.
Yet, it was banned in Canada, The United States and many other countries about
six decades ago.  The Journalist explained why in the last issue of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Only in the last year has it been permitted to grow
Hemp legally as a crop in the province of Ontario, Canada.  Of course, the
Government is involved and it's strictly monitored and regulated by them.  Was
Hemp ever farmed in the past?  Yes, most definitely.  It was farmed for
centuries in the United States.  Some notable Hemp farmers of the past are
George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson.  Those are some
prominent figures from American History that you should easily recognize.  ;)

Quotes:

"Hemp is of first necessity to the wealth and protection of the country!"
- Thomas Jefferson

"Make the most you can of the hemp seed and sow it everywhere."
- George Washington

Medical Hemp can be used for the treatment of Cancer, AIDS, Asthma, Glaucoma,
Nausea Relief, Epilepsy, Emphysema Therapy, Migraines and many other illnesses.
Some doctors now prescribe it to their patients, legally and in many cases
illegally when it's necessary.  Other seriously ill patients have fought to have
the right to smoke or ingest marijuana legally.  In almost every case, they are
systematically denied the right to do so.  Personally, I feel that anyone
that wants to use a plant such as cannabis should be allowed to, regardless of
what the government thinks.  Our bodies are our own.  The government should
stay out of it and quit trying to control us.  It's unethical for them to
attempt to prevent sick people from using something that heals their illnesses
or is of comfort to them in my opinion.  Therefore, they are wrong to interfere
and exert the "power of the law" to try to stop anything that has medicinal,
economic, ecological and energy saving purposes.  Also, there hasn't been a
single recorded death attributed directly to the use of marijuana.  That's the
*only* reason Big Brother can't scream and shout claiming "It kills you.  We're
only trying to protect you."  Look up the amount of deaths related to alcohol
and cigarettes sometime, yet both are legal and the government profits from the
taxes collected on those products.  Now that some of the medical benefits of
hemp have been discussed, I'll give you some ecological statistics to read and
consider.

hemp vs. cotton:

Balance (Primary Energy input (PE) and emissions) for the life-cycle
cultivation and harvesting for hemp and cotton (ifeu-Institute in NOVA
1996). Data of 1 Mt hemp are compared with those of 1 Mt of cotton.

Substituting cotton with hemp i.e. in the textile industry would lead to
significant ecological advantages. (Bocsa, Karus; 1998, Der Hanfanbau, p.
138)

There are also economic and energy saving reasons that hemp should be grown
and utilized.  We have finite resources, the environment is being destroyed by
fat cat industries, and in many countries there are food shortages due to
drought and improper farming practices.  Hemp is a hearty plant with many
varieties that can grow in harsh climates.  It's suitable for almost any type
of environment.  The unharnessed potential that industrial hemp has is almost
unlimited.  Many people, including some famous ones such as actor Woody
Harrelson have realized that already and have been organizing protests etc. to
further the cause, publicly state their views and demonstrate them.  Of course,
the petroleum, pulp and paper industry and textile industry will forever fight
to make sure that hemp isn't legalized across North America.  Why?  Well, hemp
could be a huge industry that would be in direct competition with them.
Literally billions of dollars represent the reason that it's been criminal to
grow hemp for decades.  It's all politics and economics.  In fact, the social
reasons that it hasn't been decriminalized is minimal.  There seem to be enough
enlightened people in many parts of this continent that realize the benefits of
hemp.  However, individuals can't legalize hemp by remaining silent about the
issue or speaking softly in private.  That simply won't work towards correcting
the great wrong that was done approximately 60 years ago.

If you need more economic benefits, if hemp *and* marijuana were legalized, the
drug wars would be minimized significantly.  Law enforcement and government
resources could be dedicated to other things that are more important to our well
being.  Wouldn't you like to see our tax dollars being spent wisely rather than
on prosecuting teenagers that were busted for possession?  I most definitely
would.  The cost of prosecuting someone for possession of marijuana, filling
out paper work for court cases, wasting a judge's time, housing them in jail
and making sure they have a criminal record for life (plus, restricting them
from crossing the border) etc. is almost immeasurable.  It's such a waste.  It
is the real crime as far as I'm concerned... and the government is responsible.
Also, is selling a bag of weed to a friend such a big "criminal activity"?  I
don't consider anyone that does that to be a drug dealer.  Yet, that's exactly
what they are labelled as being.  It's ridiculous.  Think about how much of a
fucking joke it really is.  Why are they continuing to do that in many parts
of this country?  Why are they destroying the lives of our youths and taking
away their future?  As in, their job opportunities are extremely limited if
they get a criminal record because of something so trivial and meaningless.
It's sickening.  Holland should be the example for the world.  The savings on
court and jail costs alone for that country must be immense.  I can't even
imagine the amount that the U.S. spends on prosecuting and housing people
that were either selling or in possession of marijuana.  Don't they realize
that there is no way that they can stop people from importing, exporting,
growing, smoking, selling it no matter how much money they throw away?  I
hope that eventually "society" evolves its way of thinking and finally realizes
how stupid this "drug war" against hemp and marijuana is and has been.  It
is truly absurd and illogical.  Their sense of morality and logic are totally
flawed.  It's fucked.  If they want to catch criminals, they should start
looking at themselves.

In a future article, I am going to discuss how cops steal drugs (directly from
citizens on the street and "evidence" that's already at the police station) as
well as propaganda slogans and techniques that they use on the general public
to influence and brainwash them.  As in, they say "Selling/Smoking marijuana
isn't a victimless crime." "That it's a gateway drug."  "Marijuana is addictive
and harmful." etc.  I also want to review some of the anti-drug commercials that
I've seen on television.  Basically, this article is just a sample of what will
follow.

If you want more information on hemp, there are literally thousands of internet
sites that you can check out that offer good information.  Simply use a search
engine (like altavista) and search for "hemp".  ;)

Here's a quick comment on the new public service announcements on television
(or rather, propaganda commercials)... The one that shows a girl standing in
a kitchen smashing dishes with a frying pan, saying "This is what it does to
your family..." etc. is one of the better ones that I've seen.  It's hilarious.
At the end she asks "Any questions?" while looking right into the camera.  Here
are five questions that I think she would enjoy being asked:

1.  Do you want to fuck?
2.  Have you ever been baked?
3.  Do you want to smoke a bowl with me sometime?
4.  Why does talking about drugs make you so excited?
5.  How much money were you paid to do that commercial?

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                            {H/P}
Internet outdials:

This is going to be a brief article summing up Internet outdials.  Outdials used
to be extremely popular in the 80's and early 90's hacking era.  Now that
everyone and their dog has visited Matt's script archive and has a WWW board
running or idles for hours on IRC, Outdials have become passe'.  

First let me explain what an Internet outdial is and what it is intended to be
used for.  Companies who don't want to go through the bother or worry of
installing modems in all of their users computers will install one and connect
it to the Internet for all users to access, both on and offsite.  Employees can
telnet to modem.company.com, enter a few commands and dial in to a companies
database, server, or any company system that may require telephone access.  Most
outdials will only call local exchanges.  There are some called GODS or Global
Outdials which you can call world wide, but they are sparse so if you come
across one, consider yourself lucky, don't give it out and don't abuse it.

Why should you be interested in Internet outdials.  Well the obvious reason is
exploration.  If you connect to the modem and redial the last number, chances
are you've just found that companies/universities computer.  Another  reason to
use outdials is computer/processing time.  You can use it to scan exchanges.  If
you connect to an outdial in 619 now you can scan systems in San Diego without
paying ld charges.  The final reason for using outdial and the reason they
became popular in the 80's is to call ld BBS systems.  If you know of a cool BBS
in 202 you can look for an outdial in that AC, connect to it and dial up the
BBS.

Traditionally to find an outdial you would have to be on one of the X.25 packet
switched networks, sprintnet, datapac, rosnet etc.  To connect to these outdials
you either had to be on a host on that particular network, have a valid NUI
(Network User Identifier) or hope the NUA accepts collect calls.  A lot of the
PADS you connect to there would also be outdials.  Some were passworded, some
were not.  When you connected to a NUA that had an outdial you would get a
message similar to "Call Connected" "Hayes Modem" or "MODEM 312" typing HELP
or ? will give you a list of commands.  There are scanners available
specifically for X.25 networks.

If you don't have a valid NUI or access to x.25 networks you can still access
outdial via the Internet.  This is the most common way outdials are accessed
today, since everyone seems to have forgotten about packet switched networks.
All you have to do is telnet to modem.victim.com and enter in the modem
initialization instructions an or password.  Once you figure out what area code
the modem is in, your set to start dialing. Another way I have heard that you
can access an outdial is by connecting to a Cisco router and scanning for ports
that answer in the 2000-2020 range.  If there is not password, type enable and
then ATZ to dial out.  I have not personally tested this method.

When you connect to an outdial there are any number of commands that you can try
to initialize the modem.
ATZ
ATDT9
ATDT8
Connect (hayes)
Modem
Hayes
Dial
Dialout
Call

West Virginia Network was kind enough to give us instructions on using their
outdials at http://wvnvm.wvnet.edu/~roman/dialout.html

How do you find outdials?  Well by scanning.  You can scan on the PSN using
wardialers, datapac specific scanners and general ones like Ultradial are
available on the Internet and good h/p BBSes.  You can scan blocks of IP
addresses using any of the various ip scanners currently available for *NIX,
Windows and Mac.  I suggest scanning universities ip ranges.  The last way and
the easiest is to find good updated outdial lists.  A lot of these lists have
been passed down over the years and recompiled over and over.  DeadKat and the
guys who put out the COTNO zine used to have an updated one, (Issue #2 and #5)
Voyager used to include one in his 2600 faq which he hasn't updated in years
and I suspect he is finished with it.  Recently our Russian komrade Cyberlirik
released an updated list that includes both X.25 and Internet outdials.  You can
find his list in the most recent CodeZero release "Confidence Remains High" #8
(crh-008.zip).  It is up to Blackened as to whether he wants to include those
lists in this release.  I'll append portions of them to the end of this article.
If not, you can find the zines on any good h/p Board (such as AJFA) and on the
Internet at ftp.sekurity.org.

I have been gathering this information for years and it comes from a variety of
sources, 2600 faq, COTNO, Cyberlirik, Codezero, KM's haq faq, PhiberX, BBSes,
chats, email, usenet and everywhere else.  If I forgot you, whoops....

Specify whether or not you want it to be published.  Also, the baud rates
(300/1200 baud) for the DATAPAC outdials are a little outdated, so don't let
that discourage you from using them.  My final comment is, if you want to find
some DATAPAC dialups, look in the phone book for the ones in your NPA.  ;)

INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}
An Interview of Blackie Lawless:

This is a very recent interview that was recorded during a voice conversation
I had with Blackie Lawless.  We hadn't spoken in almost a month, so many
topics were discussed at length.  Not everything was transcribed from tape
to this text file as not all portions were relevant to this interview.  He
agreed to do the interview as long as he wasn't asked certain questions.
I respect him and his privacy, therefore that request wasn't a problem.  At
any rate, here it is.  Enjoy...

<B>  = BLACKENED
<BL> = Blackie Lawless

(Anything inside of brackets was added by me to explain abbreviations etc.)

<B> - Introduce yourself to the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.

<BL> - I've been known exclusively as Blackie Lawless for many years now.  I'm
sure that some of the old users on AJFA recognize the alias and remember me.
I can't remember when I first called your board, or even what software you were
running at the time.  I just recall that you were on a V/X (virus exchange and
research) board here in the States and invited me to call your board.  Before
that, we used to post messages to each other in Swash_Net and some of the other
nets of that era like VX_NET, NuKE_NET, RaBiD_NET etc.  At that point in time, I
was just exploring some ld boards and reading the "underground" virus and some
of the pirate nets.  Everything was still new to me then, and I had a lot to
learn.  Back then, I was still calling warez boards and such.  I was also
interested in viruses and virus source code.  <laughter>  Ah yes, those were
the days man.  I doubt if most people reading this even remember Swash_Net
and the warez cracking groups back then.  But that was then, and this is now.

<B> -  Yeah, that was back when Dark Coffin was still around...(formerly The
Crypt Newsletter HQ in the 215 NPA)  That was a cool board.  I kind of miss some
of those old nets man.  Anyways, how did you enter the h/p scene?

<BL> - I was on some V/X boards and noticed that there were some text files
online like CuD (Computer Underground Digest), Phrack etc.  I downloaded some
issues and after reading them I wanted to call some h/p boards to check them
out.  After that, I basically quit calling boards that carried viruses and
began reading and learning about hacking, phreaking, security, various operating
systems etc.  That was while I was in high school.  Then I went off to college.
That's basically when I really started to get involved in it.  I started calling
a lot of ld h/p boards, going to various Hacker Cons etc. and wanted to know
about everything that I could.  I found out about using codes to call ld and
wanted to learn more about the telco and how things worked.  Then there were
the loops, bridges, Alliance Conferences, Telenet, Datapac, and eventually I
discovered a little thing called the Arpanet.  Then I got into university
outdials, hacking PBXs, VMBs, 1-800 extenders etc.  It was all a lot of fun.

<B> - That's cool.  Do you want to mention what university you attended?

<BL> - No, I'd rather not.

<B> - Alright.  That's fine man... I should've been better prepared to do this
interview.  I don't have any set list of questions to ask you.  Anyways, you
obviously progressed after you originally found out about the existence of
h/p boards and text files.  Didn't you briefly work as a PBX system installer?

<BL> - Yes, in fact I did.  That was a couple of years ago though.  I'm not at
liberty to say where I work or what I do now.  My employer doesn't have a clue
about my past, what I'm into, or the fact that I'm doing this interview.  I'd
like to keep it that way too.

<B> - No problem man.  In the past though, you were a Unix admin though right?
Have you ever considered working for a Telco as a security consultant or
anything related to that field?

<BL> -  Yes, I was a Unix admin in the past.  No, I have never considered
working for a Telco in any capacity.  I haven't had any job offers like that
either.  However, I won't say that I'll rule out that type of work in the
future.  I think it would be quite interesting.

<B> - I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but would you ever collaberate
with the SS (Secret Service) or FBI?  I mean, to track down hackers/phreaks
and get people that you know busted?  Obviously, I'm not accusing you of doing
that.  I just wondered, if in a hypothetical situation in which *you* were
busted and would serve say 5+ years in prison as an example... would you take
a deal to serve 6 months in exchange for ratting on people or helping the FBI
bust them for shit?  As in, setting people up, recording conversations,
collecting evidence against them etc.?

<BL> - That's a very interesting and provocative question.  It's difficult
to say what I'd do in that situation.  If it meant ratting on my good friends,
I don't think that I could do that.  However, 5 years of one's life is a long
time to spend in prison.  So, if it only meant helping them catch malicious
hackers that I don't know very well, I would probably accept that in order to
get a light sentence.  Who wouldn't?  I'm no fool.  Then again, I wouldn't
like working with the FBI either, as I'm not a snake in the grass.  Some people
are made to be narcs.  Others aren't.  I don't believe that I'm the narc type,
but if I was forced into it and threatened with a really long sentence, then
I'd have to think about the choices and accept whatever consequences that would
result from it.

<B> -  Yeah.  One wrong choice can really fuck up your life.  I wasn't implying
that you're a narc or anything like that man.  I trust you and you know that
I don't trust many people.  <laughter>  Squeeling on a friend or setting them
up is the worst thing that you can do.  It's nice to hear that you wouldn't
do that.  Anyway, what do you think is wrong with the h/p scene these days?

<BL> - The kids expect too much to be done for them.  They want passwords,
codes, accounts, information on HOW-TO do whatever... which isn't the right
approach to take.  It's about learning on your own.  It's about exploring
systems.  That's the fun of hacking.  Being told exactly how to do something
in a text file isn't the point of it in my opinion.  It's changed so much with
the internet and the popularity of AOL with the kiddies.  That's what is
unfortunate.  Plus, there are codes kids that think they're phreaks after using
an extender or dialing out through a VMB or PBX.  It's become a joke.  They have
no respect for the true phreaks, the veterans of the h/p scene.  It is laughable
that they get dropped off by their parents at a Hacker Con and go crazy since
it's the first time they've been away from home on their own, unsupervised.  The
main problem is that they want to be given information, instead of wanting to
seek it out and find it.  It's not free.  That's something they should realize.
Do you agree?

<B> - Yeah, I agree with you.  What do you think of the people that think
they're better than everyone else?  You know, the ones that think they're
l33t hax0rs?  I'm not referring to the people that can truly be described as
elite... but rather the lame wannabes.

<BL> - It's lame.  It's pathetic.  It's disgusting to read the shit they
write.  That's all I can think of to comment on that.  That's about all that
should be said.

<B> - What do you think of Telnet h/p boards?

<BL> - There's nothing wrong with them.  They're keeping the bbs scene alive
in a weird way... I still enjoy posting messages on h/p boards once in a while.
I wouldn't mind calling a few overseas h/p boards sometime.  I think that if
your local scene is filled with immature idiots or is dead, then why not run
a Telnet board and get ld users from all over?  There's nothing wrong with
that.  Of course, there's nothing wrong with dialup boards either.

<B> - Okay.  Now back to some questions about you.  How'd you get your alias?

<BL> - Obviously, it's from the lead singer of the group W.A.S.P.  They're
an old heavy metal group.  I started using this handle in the 80s.  It's
stuck with me ever since.

<B> - So, are you still into listening to metal?  Or, do you listen to a
wide variety of music?

<BL> - A very wide variety... everything from hard rock, alternative, metal,
and classical.  I'm open to other types of music as well.  My musical tastes
are as vast as my personality.

<B> - Yeah, since we've known each other for quite a few years...I know what
your personality is like quite well.  Hehe.

<BL> - Indeed you do.  <laughter from us both>  What other questions do you
wish to ask?

<B> - I don't know how long this interview will be once it's published in
text format.  Therefore, I'll end it now.  If we haven't covered everything,
then we can always do a second interview in the future if you'd like.

<BL> - Alright.  I'm willing to do that.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity
to be interviewed man.  I'd also like to thank Damage, INC. and give a shout
out to the users in 519 that remember me.

<B> - Thanks for agreeing to be interviewed man.  I hope to continue this at
another time, so that I can ask you some questions about certain h/p related
things like your most memorable experiences, accomplishments, goals for the
future etc.  Anyways, we can move on to discussing other things now...

This is my letter of to the editor in regards of the Damage, INC. newsletter 
#8. I have read all the newsletters up to date and just finished reading the 
first newsletter which I never finished :) I read this issue (#8) in about 
30-35 minutes and was hooked from article 1.

The Damage, INC. newsletter is a great magazine for many reasons but one of
them is more outstanding IMO. The newsletter is informative, not only for the 
hackers & phreaks but it also gives alot of interesting, informative articles 
on government/ufo/conspiracies which is my favourite sections of the 
newsletter. I also enjoy the Damage, INC. newsletter because it gives 
prespectives of the mass-media, and an interesting look at GREED and also
offers opinions which are good because you find out what other people think
about certain subjects.  The Damage, INC.  newsletter #8 offered the best
information on cloning out of any recent text files which I have read (most
from 98) It offered names, cloning attempts, scientific information which
really grasped me.

I have a few questions and suggestions for the Damage, INC. group. How long
have you been around?!  I know you didnt release an article and thats when it
started, you must have been around for longer right?!  I like that it has a 
topic below the date and the issue number. The last one for example, "We Keep 
You Honest" was a cool topic for the latest issue. I also liked that their is 
a bigger and more explict copyright notice right before the Introduction to 
the Damage, INC. newsletter section. I think that might help prevent lamers 
who commit copyright infringements, and think a lame apology will take care of
it. That was one improvement I enjoyed in the newsletter. I also have 1 
suggestion for the Damage, INC. newsletter... it says at the bottom "any 
feedback or letters to the editor should be sent to BLACKENED, or on a Damage,
INC. board near you. He can also be contacted via Echomail/Netmail in several 
nets" I think it would be better for LD readers, or readers that only call 
1 board that you be more specific to which nets so they can reach 
Blackened alot easier. Also maybe somewhere in the newsletter include a list 
of all the members, coders, artists, writers, etc who are involved in the 
Damage, INC. newsletter. If that is too much, include a list with updated 
members everytime a new member has been introduced.

That is all my feedback for the Damage, INC. newsletter. Keep them coming (on 
time) like they have been 8 for 8 and keep them informative and keep the 
readers wanting more (speaking for myself)

Editor -  Thanks for the feedback man.  As you know, we always appreciate
          hearing from our loyal readers.  As for the compliments about the
          articles that we've written thus far, they are well taken.

          We'll try to continue writing interesting, informative articles that
          include our opinions.  Personally, I feel that it's important to
          write about things from our own perspective, rather than that of
          others.  Also, I'm glad you enjoyed reading my article on cloning
          and benefitted from the information contained within it.  I did
          research the topic, had been thinking about it for many months and
          wanted to write it as objectively as possible... to show both sides
          of the issue.

          As for the large Disclaimer and Copyright Notice, I hope that it's
          noticeable now and obeyed by those that read the newsletter.  We put
          a tremendous amount of work and time into putting together this
          relatively small publication... and don't want that effort to be
          wasted.  As in, when someone rips something such as this off it
          shows that they have no respect whatsoever for what we're doing and
          trying to accomplish.  I agree, adding that was an improvement since
          it was greatly needed to make things clear.

          Your suggestions have been noted and will be considered by us.  The
          quote "We keep you honest." for the last issue was selected by
          Shatazar (in case anyone was interested in knowing)... and I felt
          that it was suitable.  It set the tone and established a theme for
          the Damage, INC. Newsletter issue #8 in my opinion.

          I've changed the portion of the newsletter that describes how I
          can be contacted.  Now it specifically states "CCi Net, Psycho/2 Net"
          so that readers can contact me easier.  That was something that I
          had previously overlooked, so thanks for the good suggestion man.
          As for the list of Damage, INC. Members, Writers etc. that's another
          good suggestion that I'm going to use.  Check out the DAMINFO.ANS
          file that's included with this issue.  It'll be updated whenever
          changes occur.

          As for your question, I wasn't completely sure if you were asking
          how long *I* have been around, or when Damage, INC. started.  The
          Damage, INC. FAQ will answer those types of questions for everyone.


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
Violence.  Reader discretion is advised:

This program contains violent content.  Viewer discretion is advised.  I'm sure
you've seen those words preceding certain television programs.  It's meant to
be a warning to viewers.  Basically, it notifies them about depictions of
violent scenes (or in some cases, course language, mature scenes etc.) that
will be seen in the following program.  I realize that this article will most
likely be deemed "controversial" by many people.  However, that doesn't concern
me.  I honestly don't care what is politically correct, and have publicly
stated that many times.

There isn't enough real violence depicted in the media (on television, in
newspapers, in movies etc.) in my opinion.  You might consider that to be a
strong statement, a false statement, or an absurd statement to make.  That is,
most people in "society" just don't say or write things such as that.  Why not?
The answer is simple.  They fear the truth and don't want to face reality.  The
truth is that there's more violence in "society" than there is on television or
in the movies.  That's just reality.  You can try to run and hide from it, but
it will still exist.  It won't change.  It won't go away.  Violence in "society"
isn't suddenly going to vanish into oblivion...even if it's removed from all
media sources.

In this instance, the media isn't to blame.  The media isn't guilty.  Television
and movie producers aren't responsible for making people go on shooting sprees.
They aren't using guns to kill, nor are they telling the viewers to go out and
start killing everyone.  Therefore, the zombies that are searching for someone
to blame are wrong when they shift it onto the back of the medium of their
choice.  Meaning, lyrics in music, video games, text/printed articles, movies,
television shows, comics, radio shows, and concerts aren't responsible for
what violent acts individuals choose to do.

"Kill", "Born to Kill", "Shoot to Kill", "Natural Born Killers", "Kill 'em All".
Those are just a few short phrases.  I could list many others, include graphical
images or animations etc.  Would that make those words more effective at
brainwashing or influencing you?  Is it that easy to influence someone to kill?
I hope that people have more willpower and intelligence than that.  I know that
the zombies don't though.

The problem is that "society" wants someone to blame whenever there's an
incident such as a kid shooting his classmates.  Obviously, things like video
games, comic books, music, movies, watching too much television are easy
targets for them to use as excuses.  They don't want to find out the real reason
that things like that are happening.  "Society" is violent.  Visit a jail or a
prison sometime or talk to the guards that work there.  They know about the
cases of inmates that live there before they even arrive.  The mass media in
general doesn't show enough *real* violence.  It's scripted.  It's fake.  It's
not reality.  It's not even a realistic portrayal of what goes on in "society".
Even the most accurate, violent, movies and television shows can't compare to
what we can witness in daily life.  The reason is that it simply can't be done.
The only things that come close are certain documentaries that interview actual
prison inmates, take actual footage from inside prisons etc.  Even then, the
camera can distort reality.  It also only records events from one perspective,
which is what the cameraman is witnessing and pointing towards.  Plus, it's
edited, directed, cut apart, censored etc. before you even see it.  In other
words, Hollywoodized material is fiction and not fact.  It's the picture of
"society" that they want you to see... and not what actually exists.

As for the violent stories on the news, they aren't creating violence.  They're
simply reporting it... and obviously profiting from it.  If you don't like
seeing it, you can change the channel.  That won't stop it though.  It'll only
prevent you temporarily from seeing it.  So, that's not the solution to the
problem.  Once you open your eyes, you will see it again.  You can't avoid it
that easily.

How does the media depict violent events?  Is it a school shooting a feeding
frenzy?  Do they glorify and sensationalize violence when they report on
the consequences of events such as that?  Does it desensitize people?  Should
violent events such as that be censored?  Do kids get ideas from watching it?
Does the media make anyone go on a murder rampage?  Should kids be getting their
morals and ethics from the government and media, or someplace else?  Will they
try to imitate another teenager that's killed people at their school if they
watch the news?  Is the media the cause of violence?  Should they be allowed to
show live coverage (such as the recent suicide in L.A. that took place on a
freeway and was shown live after they disrupted other programming)?  Should
there be a delay of a few seconds so that they have a chance to make a decision
about whether or not to show violent scenes like that?  Is television itself
influencing people to go out and do those types of violent things?  The question
that's always asked is "Who's to blame?" whenever there is a school shooting or
another violent incident involving guns.

Those are just a few questions that you'll have to answer yourselves.  You must
form your own opinions.  In this article, I've given you a few important things
to think about.  You may not agree with what I've said, but it can't be disputed
that violence exists... and it always has.  Television didn't create it and
doesn't force us to be violent.  The seed of violence will always remain with
us.  It's the nature of the "society" that you live in.  Indeed, that's the root
of it and the only thing that can be blamed.

We need to see more *real* violence on television.  They should teach people
what the consequences are.  They should show them patients that've been shot
by taking them to hospitals.  They should show them the morgue.  They should
let them see dead bodies of people that were shot and killed.  They should
visit graveyards.  They should make them realize that there's a difference
between fake/fantasy/fiction and real violence.  The difference should be
explained and taught to them.  Perhaps if more people are exposed to reality,
they won't be so quick to dismiss things or look for someone else to blame.

REPORTS FROM THE FRONT -                                          {REPORTS}
Information on Micro$oft's Main Web Site:

Nevada sent me the following text file, which I decided to publish in order to
to inform readers.  It's also being published in an attempt to warn readers
about web sites such as Micro$oft's...


        Microsoft Main Web Site Info.			   10/5/98


     Here are a few interesting items, concerning the Microsoft Main Web
     Site.                                              
        
     1/ As you are aware, if you are on the Net, you are continually
        bombarded with "cookie" notices.  Most sites will still allow
        you unhindered access, even if you refuse to accept these
        "cookies".  I'm not about to go into an explanation of what
        "cookies" are; if you don't know, do some research on the topic.  
        On the Microsoft Site, if you don't accept the "cookies", you get
        very limited access, and in some cases can not even access anything.
       
     2/ In a never-ending effort to be helpful, Microsoft now has a new
        utility on the Downloads/Upgrade Web Site.  It's known as the
        "Download Wizard".  It scans your entire hard drive, and then
        makes "recommendations" on what software, drivers, updates you
        need.  Personally, I find this just a bit *too* helpful; and
        I'm more than a little skeptical, that this is merely a "helpful
        utility".

     3/ This is the actual text from the site, it has been saved as a
        .txt file, and the fancy html format has been stripped:


  Download Wizard

SOURCE AND SCRIPTS -                                               {SOURCE}
IP Spoofer:

Some readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter requested that we include more
C source code... and demonstrate how to use inline assembly etc.  So, I've
obliged by including this IP Spoofer.  In case you're a novice C programmer,
look for the lines that start with "__asm__"  Clip out the source and save it
to a file called IPSPOOF.C.

THC PHREAK'S TOP TEN LIST -                                       {TOP TEN}
Differences between Americans and Canadians:


    1. Canadians drink more beer.

    2. Americans drink weak beer.

    3. Canadian beer is stronger... and we like it that way.  :)

    4. True Canadians drink Molson Canadian.  Americans don't have a brand of
       beer named after them.  That's the only thing we have that they don't.
       We've sure got 'em there eh?  :)

    5. Canadian (B.C. grown) marijuana is the strongest.  We like it that way.
       Just ask our Olympic gold medal winning snowboarder, Ross.  Or, ask
       a few Americans that smuggle it across the border.  :)

    6. Americans have more guns, tanks, subs, ships, helicopters and nukes.

    7. Canadians have more snowshoes, skates, snow boots and hockey sticks.

    8. Americans are capatalists.  They're patriotic and aren't afraid to let
       you know it by waving their flag and singing their national anthem.
       They're proud, bold, brazen, outspoken and flaunt being an American
       wherever they travel.  Damn Yankees.  Hehe.  :)

    9. Canadians can't decide which flag to wave or fly.  Each province has its
       own flag.  We're too humble, shy and reserved to show our patriotism.
       The rest of us squabble with each other and threaten to separate from
       Canada.  We can't sing either.  But we sure know how to party, eh?  :)

    10. Canadians snowmobile and ski in June.  We like snow, ice and cold winter
        days.  We are a bilingual nation with two official languages (we can all
        speak both English and French... almost fluently).  On the extremely
        rare occassions when the temperature is above twenty degrees outside, we
        bitch and complain endlessly that it's too hot.  Then someone inevitably
        says "No, it's not the heat it's the humidity."  Canadians burn easily
        too.  We're the very definition of rednecks (or lumberjacks).  You can
        always spot a Canadian in a crowd while they're on vacation in Florida
        or Cuba.  Our currency is worthless in other countries.  But what can
        you expect from dollars named "loonies" and two dollar coins called
        "toonies" or "washers"?  We talk about Hockey all year round.  Nothing
        else matters to us.  To Americans, especially FOX Network Executives,
        Hockey doesn't matter at all.

In case you couldn't tell, the above was written as a joke.  It's a parody,
so whether you're American or Canadian, don't take it too seriously or feel
insulted by anything that I've written.

THOUGHTS, POEMS AND CREATIVE WRITING -                            {WRITING}
Thoughts on Enlightenment:

Sometimes genius manifests itself as madness.  Our primitive instincts can
be cloaked by intelligence, but they still exist beneath the surface.  Time
and space are intertwined and woven together like the threads of DNA in our
bodies.  They are one with each other.  Thoughts can travel faster than the
speed of light.  Physical laws do not apply to everything.  Physics only applies
to the physical.  Open your mind.  Reality isn't just what you've been told to
believe.  It is what you are aware of, unaware of and what you think.  Think of
what is possible instead of limiting yourself to dismissing the unexplained or
scientifically unproven.  What is considered to be impossible at one point in
time during one era, is many times possible at another point.  The impossible to
one person is someone else's possibile.  Explore the possibilities.  Examine the
truth and not just what you've been told.  Mind over matter.  A mind should be
powerful, not weak.  It should be ever expanding, a source of energy and great
strength.  To learn fact, don't just memorize...analyze.

How can one "follow an experiment?"  Experimentation should mean experimenting,
not following a scripted text with a list of instructions and guidelines.  The
results shouldn't be known beforehand.  One result can't be called incorrect and
another correct.  Yet, you are taught in school that only one result is correct
and that if that result isn't achieved, then the entire experiment is a failure.
You are told that everyone should have the exact same results and that any
deviation is wrong.  Why try to "experiment" if you already know what the
results will be?  Don't attempt to achieve a specific, certain result.  The
purpose of experimenting is to find out, not to get the result that you were
told will occur.  The process of experimenting and learning are the most
important and they outweigh any results that are found.  Contrary to what you
may have been told, there are no right and wrong answers.  To experiment means
to learn.

If you want to be the same, conform.  If you want to be an individual, then be
creative.  Voice your opinions.  Express your beliefs.  Show that you aren't
just another zombie.  Share your uniqueness and ideas.  Experience what true
individualism means.  Use your mind to the fullest.  There are no boundaries.
There aren't any restrictions on knowledge or thinking, except for the blinding
self-inflicted ones that you've made and forced upon yourself.  Define yourself
by what you want to know, and not the knowledge that you already possess.  You
are the only one to blame for what you lack.  You are responsible for going
beyond what you think you know.  Become self-taught.  Become a free thinker.
Become enlightened.  Knowledge isn't an illusion.  Knowledge is something that
must be gained and possessed.  It can't be fake.  It has to be real.  Wisdom,
experience and intellect cannot be faked either.  Only fools believe that they
can be faked and hidden underneath lies.  In the end, fakeness will haunt you.
It'll make certain that you don't evolve, progress and gain knowledge.
Discovering the true meaning of learning is one of the most fulfilling
achievements that you can make.  Seeking out knowledge is such an honourable
pursuit that it should be your main goal.

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Motivational Closing Comments:

Damage, INC. asks that you join us in searching out and destroying ignorance
and misinformation.  We believe that many of our readers are intelligent,
enlightened people, and not zombies.  I also hope that you didn't assume the
quote for this issue meant something else.  If anything, it means to destroy
people's misconceptions, false assumptions, false information and accusations.
If you are against misinformation, then do something about it.  If you think
that I'm a ranting and raving psychotic hypocrite that only preaches and
doesn't practice what I preach, think again.  I am doing and will continue to
do whatever is necessary to fight for my beliefs.  That includes fighting the
ignorant masses of zombies in any way possible.  The Damage, INC. Newsletter
was created to fight ignorance and give out information.  So, we *are* doing
something... and we'll keep going against the grain until the end.  There are
many possibilities and we don't want to ignore or discount any of them.  One
possible result is that a great awakening will happen and a revolution will
begin.  In order for that to happen, we need more enlightened minds.  In my
opinion, drastic change is needed.  In desperate times, people are driven to
take desperate actions.

Seek out knowledge and eliminate ignorance.  The pursuit of knowledge as a
goal is so worthwhile that it cannot be overstated.  Become active.  Do
*something*.  Take actions against the causes that you feel strongly about.
Become informed, develop your own beliefs, then learn what can be done.
Complacency and indifference aren't acceptable.  "Society" wants you to be
misinformed about many things that they deem to be wrong.  They don't want
you to know the truth.  They've built a "society" that is based upon pure
ignorance.  The bricks and the mortar that were used in its construction are
lies and propaganda.  The opposite of construct is destruct.  That is what
must be done.  The whole fucking brick shithouse has to be demolished and
done in.  That's the only real solution.  It's already rotting and decaying.
The mass media is an instrument of "society" that is willfuly misinforming
the masses of zombies about things such as drugs, current events etc.  When
they get caught lying or exploiting someone, they're quick to make a lame
apology to appease the zombies.  In their own sick, twisted, perverted way they
believe that they are teaching their audience (viewers, readers, listeners)
morality and educating them.  Nothing could be further from the truth though.
I believe that the whole "system" is ready to collapse... and when it does there
won't be any "society" left for zombies to cling to for security.  I hope that
it is on the verge of happening.  If it was only a matter of lighting a match to
ignite the powderkeg, I'd be there with a flamethrower.  Unfortunately, a
greater catalyst is needed.  Perhaps you think that I'm exaggerating or preying
on people's fears.  Maybe that's true to a certain extent.  Then again, maybe
that's just the reality that people aren't willing to face and I am simply
revealing it to everyone.  Not everything is crystal clear.  Therefore, you
might not be able to see and realize that "society" is demented and disease
infested.  However, that is the way it is... like it or not.  In my opinion,
people are either with "society" or against it.  You can hide in the shadows or
you can draw a line in the sand and take a stand.  It's your choice.
