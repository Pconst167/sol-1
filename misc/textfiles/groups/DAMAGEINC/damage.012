INTRODUCTION:  It's now October 1998.  It's the 12th issue.  We've managed
               to survive an entire year of writing and releasing issues of
               the Damage, INC. Newsletter!  ;)  Sure, we've experienced our
               fair share of difficulties.  We have also encountered several
               obstacles along the way.  However, nothing that's worthwhile is
               without its problems.

               In order to 'celebrate' issue #12, we have included more hollow
               point ammunition, DU rounds, high capacity magazines, night
               vision goggles, laser targetted scopes, fragmentation grenades,
               high explosive cluster bombs, laser/satellite guided Tomahawk
               cruise missiles, an assortment of smart bombs and of course,
               nukes galore.  Indeed, we're armed to the teeth and extremely
               dangerous.  So, put on your best suit of kevlar body armour, jump
               in your re-enforced concrete bunker, drink a few cold beers,
               light up a fat joint and remember to watch CNN for complete live
               coverage of the fireworks because this issue is fully loaded and
               action packed...

               Translation:  We've included more articles, more information,
               clipped out the filler, exposed the truth, targeted ignorance,
               waged war against corruption and are going to nuke 'em all.  So,
               prepare yourselves for a kick ass issue that's interesting,
               creative and informative.  ;)

               In case you haven't detected it by my comments, this is a
               theme issue.  Obviously, the quote "Armed and Dangerous"
               isn't meaningless... or just there to attract the attention
               of readers.  Information is dangerous.  It's potent.  It is
               a powerful weapon to possess.  Arm yourselves with it by
               becoming informed about all that interests you.  It's time
               to fill up your clips with bullets, lock and load.  As in,
               open your mind, nourish your brain, use the knowledge and
               information that's stored.  Simply using your brain for a basic
               Input/Output data storage device isn't enough.  Awaken and
               enlighten yourselves.  Develop your mind and reap the rewards
               that it gives you.  There's so much to uncover, reveal, explore,
               discover and learn.  That's what is so amazing.  There are no
               absolutes and no limits... just possibilities.  You can *never*
               think about too many things or think too much.  Just as, you
               *can't* learn or know too much.  That's why it's such a slow,
               ongoing process.  And h/p is no different.  Therefore, if you
               want to advance, you must continue to do the things that I
               mentioned above... and pursue your goals.  It's not quick and
               easy.  It's not about downloading programs/tools/utilities that
               'hack/phreak' for you either.  It's more like a long, strenuous
               journey of gathering knowledge, wisdom and experience.


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Big Brother uses technology against you.

Have you ever been involved in a conversation with a person that is truly naive
when it comes to technology in general?  In my experiences, it is not a very
enlightening conversation to say the least.  Many naive people that I know have
been influenced by Big Brother's propaganda.  The most dangerous lie that they
tend to believe is that "all technology is good."  Such a broad claim is
extremely ignorant and dangerous.  It causes them to have a false sense of
security and misleads them into optimistically believing that the future will
be better due to new technological advancements.  Obviously, that doesn't have
to be the case and that it can work both ways.  All intelligent people should
know that technology can be used to benefit *and* harm people.

It is such ignorance of technology that Big Brother promotes and relies on.
Afterall, making sure that people are ignorant only strengthens Big Brother's
control and power over the naive, gullible masses.  To Big Brother, an
uninformed population is extremely easy to spy on... with little chance of
being detected.  They're like a hungry wolf in an open field of sheep.  Easy
prey.  In this article, we will look at how Big Brother, with the total
cooperation of Bell, is using the telephone system to spy on the citizens of
"free" nations.  As advances in telephone and computer technologies occur at a
fantastic rate, so does Big Brother's ability to invade and destroy our right
to have private telephone conversations and transmissions.

For many decades, Big Brother has wanted to be able to randomly scan the entire
telephone system, searching for "thought crimes."  Up until this decade, it has
been impossible because of the vast quantity of people that access the country
wide telephone system at any one time.  Even in Communist Russia, the KGB
couldn't watch and listen to every telephone conversation, although they tried
their best by heavily bugging the Soviet telephone system.  The same is true of
the CIA, FBI, CSIS, etc.  They've desperately wanted to help Big Brother root
out "thought crimes," but their technology was lacking.  Back then, spying on
citizens using the telco on a massive scale was only a pipe dream, instead of
an achievable objective or a reality.

As I mentioned above, times have changed.  In a sense, their technological
dreams have come true.  Their goals can now be reached... and spying objectives
realized.  Almost gone are the days of limited voice and data taps on individual
lines.  Voice recognition technology can give Big Brother the ability to monitor
all citizens that use the telephone system for voice conversations.  Currently,
independent businesses have claimed to be able to create software that will give
computers the ability to understand words instantly (no training required, like
home computer voice recognition software).  When certain words are said, the
software can be instructed to react by executing a command, subroutine, etc.
And with the further development of AI (Artificial Intelligence), who knows
how far the "intelligence community" will be able to go.  I won't even begin
to speculate, since their ability to invade privacy will be unimaginable.

To further prove my point, I will tell you about Votan, a corporation in
Pleasanton, California.  Votan has created a VMS that can be operated by voice
command.  No touch-tone telephone required.  Voice recognition, telephone and
computer technology have been successfully merged.  The user's commands are
understood using voice recognition software and then executed.  This is what Big
Brother has been waiting for.  It's basically an evolution of the early voice
recognition systems/software.  With Big Brother's resources, he can create a
massive voice conversation monitoring system to search for "thought crimes"
across the entire telephone system.  Think about that for a second.  It's a
terrifying thought, isn't it?

Imagine talking about "handguns" to a friend during a telephone conversation.
Big Brother's monitoring system happens to be listening in on your line during
the system's random line scanning.  The word "handgun" could trigger a small
subroutine in Big Bro's software that would immediately start recording your
conversation.  If you are a phreak that diverts, you could still be caught
eventually because Big Brother would have your voice print on record.  (Unless
you use a voice changer all of the time... or find a way to disable their voice
recognition... a backdoor through it etc.)  It could be matched to future
"thought crimes" that those bastards might record during your lifetime.  If you
don't care that your privacy is totally destroyed under this potential
monitoring system (that could be in effect any time in the near future), just
keep in mind that in most countries, "thought crimes" are criminal offenses.
In many laws, the phrase "or conspiracy to..." is enough to put you in prison
for as much time as someone that actually committed the offense.

Also, when video conferencing is built into telephones it is an eventual fact
that Big Brother will take advantage of that as well.  All Big Brother will need
is greater storage capacities (no problem since tax dollars feed Big Brother's
unquenchable need to invade our privacy) and video clips can accompany our
recorded voice conversations.  Big Brother could then put a face to the voice
and identify the "thought criminal" extremely quickly.  With a powerful system,
a Thought Policeman could access your electronic dossier as soon as your video
conference call begins.  Is this technology truly beneficial to the average
person?  Is it necessary to have in your home?  I hope I have made the point
that technology can be used for good or evil purposes.  Always be aware of
that and take it into consideration before buying into it.

This topic is definitely controversial, and a lot of facts don't exist for this
particular freedom crushing scheme.  However, as time passes and computer and
telephone technology continues to advance, the power it can offer its user is
phenomenal.  Big Brother has, is and will use technology to invade our privacy.
That's something that isn't going to change.  Arm yourself with the skills
necessary to fight back and use technology against Big Brother.  Various types
of ammunition are necessary.  Some ammo to use in this war for free thoughts
are knowledge, practical experience and an open mind.  Know your enemy and know
yourself.  Arm yourself with the awareness of the technology that exists.  Then
be willing to protect yourself against all of Big Brother's invasive methods and
weapons.  That is, by any means necessary.  Your own privacy and freedom relies
on it.  In other words, don't just allow them use new technology to their own
advantage against you.  Fight fire with fire.  I believe that is the only way
that Big Brother can be exposed and defeated.

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Hacking local systems:

These tips are an introduction to hacking local systems.  They are by no
means complete.  However, they are important and should be considered by
newbies that want to start hacking systems in their local area.  I have read
a lot of messages posted in nets lately, regarding PBXs, VMBs, extenders and
local UNIX systems etc.  Basically, the users that were posting didn't think
that this type of hacking 'still goes on'.  Some users didn't think that
companies/businesses/large corporations use PBXs and VMBs anymore.  Haha...
Many of them didn't know what the acronym PBX stands for etc.  In other words,
they were misinformed or ignorant.  The comment of "I didn't think anyone hacked
PBXs anymore or was into that." surprised me.  A few wondered about ANI and how
it relates to PBXs.  I remember one user in particular that was posting about
dialing out through PBXs and confused about ld charges etc.  Someone else
assumed that they all have 16 digit passcodes to dial out.  Some others thought
that hacking them was merely a fad in h/p.  I can assure everyone that it isn't
a fad.  Hacking PBXs is nothing new.  Plus, many hackers/phreaks are still into
hacking local systems, including PBXs, VMBs etc.  This short article is meant to
clear up some of the misinformation that's being spread out there.  You should
read these tips, keep them in mind and continue to learn about hacking local
systems safely.

Since there have already been articles included about scanning, trashing and
social engineering... I'm not going to repeat that information and explain
what each one of them is about.  However, I'll just say that you'll need to
know something about them in order to get involved in hacking local systems.

Step 1:
------

"Alright.  I've scanned a few local exchanges/entire NPA... now what?"  Well,
congratulations ace.  You were able to setup ToneLoc properly and scan local
exchanges.  ;)  Seriously though, there's a lot more that has to be done besides
scanning and finding systems.  That is, if you want to be able to do anything
with the new found numbers that you have.  What you do next all depends upon
what you've managed to find while scanning.  For example, you'll need to have
a diverter.  Some NPAs might have a free diverter.  Others have diverters with
passcodes.  Of course, if the latter is the case, hack the passcode with
ToneLoc (or whatever scanner/code hacker you prefer).  If you didn't find a
diverter, there are still many options available to you.  For example, if
you found some local extenders, find out where they reach.  Then check to see
if they divert by calling an ANI.  There should be a local ANI in your NPA.
Scan for it, check lists of ANIs or ask a local phreak for one to use.  Or,
you can use a 1-800 ANI if you have one instead.  There are also usually some
local numbers of companies that report your ANI when called.  Or, if you found
some local VMBs, hack a box and see if they support dialing out.  If they do,
check to see if they divert.  Obviously, PBXs can also be used to divert your
calls.  Again, they can be local PBXs or 1-800s.  Don't call ld h/p boards or
your ld friends with them yet though.  ;)  Don't call any carriers (local UNIX
systems etc.) and start trying to break into them yet either.  You have to know
more about diverting and safe hacking before you can start exploring.  If you've
tried all of the above, and can't figure out how to divert your calls... then
read Blackie Lawless' article on junction boxes again.  You can setup diverter
boxes on lines in Bell cans, blue box, bounce your calls, etc. as a means of
diverting as well.  Obviously, if you're going to use the junction box method
(or beige box) to call carriers, you'll need to have a laptop with a modem.

Step 2:
------

"I'm able to divert my calls now.  Wow!  This is cool.  I've scanned and found
a few systems that I want to explore.  What should I do now?"

Cool.  You're a big hax0r now.  We phear you.  ;)  Well, you still might
need to do a few things before proceeding with your hack.  For example, if
you require further information on a company, you could CNA them and go
trashing to see if you can find some valid logins, manuals and company
documents to read.  Or, you could get the name and address of the company
through a reverse database listing by entering in the phone number.  Or, you
could scan around it and try to find another one of their company's lines.  If
you find a voice line (someone answers and they identify themselves by the
company's name), you could attempt to social engineer them for whatever
information you require.  Then again, if it's just a local UNIX system, you
could just try some default accounts and passwords to login etc.  As you can
see, there are many options available to you.  It all depends upon where you
live and which company's system you are trying to access.  In some areas, the
security is very lax...since the h/p scene isn't active.  Therefore, the Admins
themselves aren't very active (lazy, don't patch holes etc.) and don't take any
measures to improve security.  Basically, if the system hasn't been hacked out
already, then it probably isn't as secure as it should be... and a lot of known
exploits will still work.  Just don't get in the habit of relying on the Admins
to be lazy and stupid... because obviously not all of them are.  ;)

It's also a good idea not to start giving out local codes (extenders, PBXs etc.)
to everyone you know... and don't know on boards or wherever.  Plus, don't
start bragging about what you're doing/hacking.  And don't do any intentional
damage to systems that you're able to get into.  That is, except for altering
logs and covering your tracks so that you won't be traced.  If you do fuck
around, it might come back to haunt you.  Not only will they be on alert, but
the security will most likely be changed in order to prevent similar
occurrences.  Not to mention, it's a good way to get yourself busted.  ;)  As
in, they'll be watching and trying to trace you for sure if you go out and do
that.  So, just keep that in mind.

Step 3:
------

"Am I ready to start exploring now?"  The short answer is, yes.  You can start
exploring whatever you've found.  That is, as long as you know what you're
doing at this point.  Meaning, you are relatively intelligent and stealthful.
Just don't abuse things such as PBXs, VMBs, extenders, any outdials etc. by
calling ld excessively with them, until they're changed, go down (in the case
of some local codes like extenders) or you're busted.  If you use a few PBXs
sparingly, then your few ld calls a month can go unnoticed for a *long* time.
;)

As for any carriers (UNIX systems, any dialup networks such as X.29 packet
switching and the like) that you find and want to explore, it's basically up to
you as to what you do.  As long as you divert, don't do any damage once
logged in, are aware of what you're doing, don't keep trying to guess a login,
know about logs (their logging system, paths) etc. then you'll probably have an
enjoyable experience.  Hopefully you aren't just out to grab passwd files to
decrypt, or get shell accounts on as many systems as you can.  And you should
also know that not all systems store their logs in default paths.  Some have
backups in hidden directories as well etc.  So, that's just another thing to
be aware of while hacking carriers.

In conclusion, local hacking can still be interesting, beneficial to you and
a lot of fun.  So, the next time someone talks about internet related hacking,
you don't have to be ashamed if you're into hacking local systems and networks.
What you get involved in is totally your choice.  Even though I divided the
article into three steps, it isn't a complete guide or set of instructions.
Basically, I just thought I'd share a few tips on the subject of local hacking:
what is out there, how to get started and what it's all about since some people
assume that this aspect of hacking is dead.  ;)

Digital Information Society's site (DIS) offers phreaking related information,
security and the underground.  Also, check out their ftp.phreak.org site for
their archive collection.  I didn't go through every area of their site, but
they have information on their users, their group, some links etc.

Secure Networks, Inc.
www.secnet.com
This site has Security auditing software, vulnerability research and various
security related services.  You can download an evaluation version of
Ballista(TM), which is one of their commercial security programs.  There
are also some free security tools available to download as well.  They also
release technical reports and security advisories etc.  From what I read,
they have information on securing proxy servers, firewalls, etc.  Overall,
it looks like a fairly decent security site.

System Failure
www.sysfail.org
If you haven't read SysFail, then visit their site and download all of the
issues.  They put together a very cool h/p related zine that offers a lot
information.  However, Sysfail issue #14 was mainly filled with DefCon reviews
by several members though.  So, make sure you leech all of the back issues.
Or, you can just download the articles that interest you.  Overall, their
site is excellent and has a lot of resources.  ;)


That's all of the reviews for this issue.  You may have noticed that many of
the sites reviewed this month are very well known and popular etc.  Well, that
was by design.  It was done as a tribute to some of the groups that've been
around in the scene for a long time.  I thought that it would be appropriate
for us to do that in issue #12 since it marks the end of a year... and is
just something different.  Also, we're going to start adding links on the
Damage, INC. web site (http://members.tripod.com/~damage_inc) to every site
that has been reviewed so that people won't forget to check them out.  ;)


CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
NWO Part 3:  U.S. Concentration Camps.

Just to be perfectly clear, this article is *not* about the camps that were
established during World War II to detain Americans and Canadians of Japanese
and German heritage.  Although the abuse of their rights was corrupt and
abdominal, it is not as bad as what faces us right now.  This article will
reveal the preparations of globalists within the United States Government to
send American citizens to concentration camps after their totalitarian regime
takes over.

U.S. National Emergency
-----------------------

The first most likely step in the globalist take-over of the United States
starts with their lackey, the President.  You may or may not know that the
President has the power to issue Executive Orders.  Executive Orders can be put
into effect at any time a national state of emergency is declared by the
President.  During a National Emergency, the President essentially becomes the
dictator of the United States.  Below I have a list of Executive Orders that can
be called upon by the President during a "national emergency":
  
   Exec.
  Order #  Civil Rights, Liberties, and Powers taken from the American people 
  -------  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  10995    All communications media seized by the Federal Government.
  10997    Seizure of all electrical power, fuels, including gasoline and
           minerals.
  10998    Seizure of all food resources, farms and farm equipment.
  10999    Seizure of all kinds of transportation, including your
           personal car, and control of all highways and seaports.
  11000    Seizure of all civilians for work under Federal supervision.
  11001    Federal takeover of all health, education and welfare.
  11002    Postmaster General empowered to register every man, woman and child
           in the U.S.A.
  11003    Seizure of all aircraft and airports by the Federal Government.
  11004    Housing and Finance authority may shift population from one locality
           to another.  Complete integration.
  11005    Seizure of railroads, inland waterways, and storage facilities.
  11051    The Director of the Office of Emergency Planning authorized to put
           Executive Orders into effect in "times of increased international
           tension or financial crisis".  He is also to perform such additional
           functions as the President may direct.

All of the Executive Orders above, plus others I was unable to list can be put
into motion if the President activates Executive Order 11490.  Richard Nixon
created 11490 on October 28, 1969.  Executive Order 11490 represents the death
of freedom and liberty in the United States.  It is also the easiest way to
mobilize the carefully laid plans of the globalists that are the enemies of the
U.S. Constitution.  These plans include the distribution of American citizens
into concentration camps, so they must work as slaves for the Federal
Government.

Rounding up the zombies
-----------------------

Before I get into the actual concentration camps, I must explain what powers
and responsibilities the various U.S. bureaucracies will have.  During a
state of national emergency, the Post Office department would be responsible
for the implementation of a mandatory national registry.  That will make it
easy for them to identify a particular slave, check their dossiers compiled
by Big Brother, etc.  Then the prospective slave can be sent to a concentration
camp that matches his or her particular skills.

The Justice Department would have joint and equal responsibility with the Dept.
of State for prevention of escape from the U.S.; for replenishing the stockpile
of narcotics; control of the national police force; for prisons, concentration
camps, slave labour camps and mental institutions; for mass feeding and housing
of prisoners and to use said "prisoners" for slave labour.

The State Department would be responsible for the safety of the United Nations
(NWO) personnel and/or property, and to prevent American citizens from escaping
from the United States.  The Department of Defense would be responsible for
seizing independent American industries; direction of service and national
production system, control of censorship; and communication expropriation of
non-industrial facilities.  The Commerce Department would be responsible for the
looting of American homes, and the redistribution of all commodities stolen.
They are also responsible for census information and human resources.  The
Treasury Department would be responsible for collection of cash and non-cash
items and the recreation of evidence of assets and liabilities.

As you should be able to clearly see, the Executive Orders listed above supply
the President (and his puppet masters) with the excuses necessary to enslave
America without the zombies reacting to the takeover until it is too late.  When
the special urban units I described in my previous NWO article are busting down
the doors of American citizens "seizing" every human being and material object
in the United States it definitely is too late.  During a declared state of
emergency, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights are suspended.  After that
happens, all of the stunned zombies will rounded up so that they can be assigned
to their slave labour camps at their local post offices.  Then the zombies will
be sent off, one by one, to various concentration camps throughout the United
States.  There they will be slaves of the New World Order.  The army will then
assist the Commerce department to loot the vacated homes.  At this time, all
firearms in the United States can be captured if the majority of Americans
allow it.

Below is a list of military bases that are prepared to become civilian
concentration camps during a "state of emergency."  This is by no means a
complete list of concentration camps.  If I was to somehow compile such a list,
I'd also have to include all American prisons that have incarcerated naive drug
users, etc. 

List of U.S. Military Bases that can become U.S. Concentration Camps
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ft. Chaffee, Arkansas                       Ft. Drum, New York
Ft. Indian Gap, Pennsylvania                Camp A. P. Hill, Virginia
Oakdale, California                         Eglin Air Force Base, Florida
Vendenberg AFB, California                  Ft. Mc Coy, Wisconsin
Ft. Benning, Georgia                        Ft. Huachuca, Arizona
Camp Krome, Florida

Also keep in mind that any prison can be easily packed to capacity and become
a concentration camp.  Do you remember that I wrote an article on prison
industries in Issue #9 of the Damage, INC. Newsletter?  In my opinion, it isn't
a coincidence that virtually all prisons in the United States have been
converted into factories that exploit slave labour.  When the globalists attempt
to take over, they only have to increase the scale of the corruption that
already exists. 

A life of slavery is the fate of the average person that chooses to live under
the control of the New World Order.  However, the short sequence of events I've
described above has been simplified due to space considerations.  I believe I've
given you a lot of information to think about.  It is a fact that there are
complex plans for the seizure of civilians, and all their property by the
globalist controlled U.S. Government.  The plans combined are called Operation
Garden Plot.  In the next issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter I will discuss
Operation Garden Plot, as well as more intricate details into their bold
conspiracy to become the totalitarian masters of the United States.

The goals of the globalist conspirators are clear.  In their New World Order,
the masses are nothing more than nameless, faceless zombies to be used as slave
labour.  What I have shared with you in this article isn't fiction created by me
to fool you.  The concentration camps are all ready for zombies that are
ill-prepared and unwilling to fight for their freedom.  The Executive Orders
exist and could easily be put into affect.  That is a sad but true fact.  I also
believe that readers around the world can benefit from this article.  Afterall,
if freedom is eliminated in the United States, rights and freedom in weak
countries like Canada will crumble extremely quickly.  Basically, they'd just
instantly follow suit.  Now that you have been introduced to this great
conspiracy, it is up to all Americans to decide if you are willing to line up
to be registered as a slave of the NWO or not when Executive Order 11490 takes
away your rights that *were* protected under the Constitution and the Bill of
Rights.  Now that you're aware of it and informed, make sure you're prepared.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Bill C-68; Corrupt and Oppressive Gun Control:

What is C-68 and its purpose?  What is the agenda of the Canadian Government
in relation to this bill?  Does it affect everyone?  I don't own a firearm,
so why should I care about it?  I'm not a Canadian, so how does C-68 apply
to me?  Why is it important that I know about it?

First, I've watched coverage of protests, read articles, reports and countless
text files on C-68 (from the National Firearm Association (NFA), people's
opinions and the actual bill itself)... therefore, I feel that I'm adequately
informed and qualified to write an article on this topic.  An article on
Bill C-68 (written by David A. Tomlinson) was included in the Reports from
the Front section.  In comparison to other articles that I've read on the
subject, it's short but it contains some very good points.  If you would like
a copy of Bill C-68 "An act respecting firearms and other weapons." and other
text files relating to it, then leave me Email.

Bill C-68 is a poorly written, intentionally ambiguous document.  The purpose
is to restrict and control firearms.  In my opinion, the goal of the Canadian
government is to eliminate them altogether... and disarm all Canadians.  Right
in C-68, "Gun Free Zones" are discussed and provisions are made for their
creation.  It is *not* just about licensing weapons and paying fees.  It is
about taking away the rights of citizens.  As in, we should have the right
to defend ourselves and protect our property.  We should be allowed to have
firearms for hunting, collecting and target shooting etc.  It isn't about
stopping criminals, reducing crime or "protecting" us from dangerous weapons.
Haha.  Whether or not guns have to be registered and licensed makes absolutely
no difference to criminals.  Obviously, they will never turn in their weapons.
Nor will they follow the laws so that their weapons can be traced back to them.
And, they don't need to buy firearms legally at gun shops with an FAC in hand.
They can steal them or smuggle them across the border into Canada if needed.
In other words, it won't affect them at all.  Therefore, that proves that
C-68 isn't aimed at criminals.  That is something that the National Firearm
Association (NFA), myself and many gun owners agree on.  It's just a logical
fact, that the government can't seem to successfully dispute... no matter
how much political rhetoric they spew out of their mouths.  Every Canadian
is affected by C-68, regardless of whether or not you currently possess any
firearms.  Especially since, they can break into your home and search for
weapons to confiscate.  That doesn't require you to do anything wrong at all.
All it takes is for a suspicious neighbour or vengeful enemy to make an
anonymous phone call stating that you have an unregistered .22 calibre firearm
hidden in your house.  Basically, that is enough to give them the power to
take actions against you... regardless of your own naiveness or innocence.

Also, Bill C-68 wasn't even available to read or download from government
web sites.  They've made a conscious effort to hide it from Canadian citizens
and make sure it's as inaccessible as possible in my opinion.  That just
proves how this country is following in the footsteps of other nations, such
as China and Cuba.  Those two communist countries aren't only trading partners
with Canada, they are role models which Cretien and the rest of the federal
Liberal Government want to follow... and aspire to become.  In fact, you
might even say that Cretien (the current Canadian Prime Minister) considers
Cuba (lead by his friend, Castro) to be one of his allies.  But that's another
topic.  ;)

One of the fundamental things that is wrong with C-68 is the overwhelming
control that it gives to a corrupt government.  Since it's so poorly written,
they can interpret sections any way that they want... and thus the Canadian
citizens with firearms can't really protect themselves against prosecution
and fines.  I've read it all, and even I can't understand how to avoid getting
busted for transporting firearms in a safe and "legal" manner.  In other words,
they can make it impossible for you to do so, since they've left so many
loop holes in the document.  Therefore, they have made sure there are provisions
for them to do whatever they want.  They can increase the fees for registering
firearms, take away the right to transport a weapon in your car, and make
zones (which could be entire cities) in which guns are totally illegal to
possess.  At least, that's how I interpret what C-68 reads... But as I stated
before, it's very difficult to be certain due to the language that they chose
to use and the way that it's written.  It is Govspeak at its finest.

I decided to include the following article by Dave Tomlinson of the NFA in
order to explain the complicated registration fees in C-68... since he
did an excellent job of showing how it works and saying it like it is.  Even
though it was written towards the end of 1996, the information that it contains
is still relevant (except for the voting/election portion at the bottom).

C-68 Firearms Fees

From: "David A. Tomlinson"
Date: Wed, 06 Nov 1996 18:41:46 -0600 (CST)
Subject: C-68 Firearms Fees

06 Nov 96:  The Canadian Firearms Centre [CFC] branch of the Department
of Justice [DoJ] has finally issued the schedule of fees for various
firearms permits, licenses, etc.  It is quite remarkable, and will
destroy the Canadian firearms community as we know it.  Some crippled
"thing" may survive, but the fee schedule is proof positive that the
Liberals are out to "get" us.

Table A says that a License to possess and to acquire non-restricted
firearms will cost you $60.  If you want to have handguns on it, it
will jump to $80.  It will also cost you $60 for a license to possess
and acquire _crossbows_.  That last license fee gets to me.  How nutty
_are_ these serfs of the Liberal Party?

The fee to register one or more currently-owned non-restricted firearms
is $10 in the first year, rising to $18.  The fee for registering a
newly-acquired one jumps your cost to $15 _per_gun_.  The fee to
register a newly-acquired restricted weapon or "prohibited firearm"
jumps again, to $30_per_gun_.  That is Liberal "social engineering."
They are making it more expensive to acquire the new firearm (behavior
that the Liberals classify as "politically incorrect") and even more
expensive to acquire any _firearm_ that the Liberals classify as
"politically incorrect."

Lose a license or a registration certificate? Its replacement will cost
you $25.

REMEMBER: YOU MUST HAVE A LICENSE PLUS ONE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE FOR
EVERY FIREARM YOU OWN WHEN C-68 COMES INTO FULL FORCE.

Table D says that the cost of importing any firearm will be boosted by
requiring the dealer to pay for a $20 Import Permit, plus $4 per
firearm imported, plus $4 per firearm for a "Confirmation of
Authorization to Import."

More "social engineering."  That adds $8 per firearm plus the
additional administrative costs to the dealer plus a share of the $20
Import Permit to the price of every imported firearm, because the
Liberals regard importing firearms and buying imported firearms as
"politically incorrect."

The same fees apply to the _exporting_ of firearms.  Canadian firearms
manufacturers are going to disappear; they cannot afford that sort of
taxation on _exports_.  Apparently the Liberals regard our few firearms
manufacturers -- who have been bringing new money into Canada by their
exports -- as "politically incorrect" businesses that their "social
engineering" will hound out of existence.

Bulk imports or exports are even worse.  The first shipment of 300 guns
- -- in or out of Canada -- costs $5000.  The next 2 shipments of 200
each cost $2000 per shipment.  That is a tax of nearly $17 per gun on
the first 300, and $10 per gun on each of the next 400.  They are
ruining Canadian competitiveness in the world market -- and for what?
"Political correctness."

It seems unlikely that any firearms business can survive this Liberal
"social engineering."  If the Liberals are re-elected, this will come
into force and all those jobs and all those foreign earnings will
disappear --along with the jobs of every Canadian in the firearms
industry.

There is one consolation for all the Canadians who will be thrown out
of work.  They will no longer be classified by the Liberal Party as
"politically incorrect" on the basis of where they work.

An Authorization to Transport a restricted firearm (replaces a Permit
to Carry) for target shooting costs $40 per year.  If you are carrying
it "To protect life,"  the fee goes up to $100 per year.  Apparently
the life of a citizen is not worth protecting, so they penalize anyone
who wants to do that.

The Table says nothing about fees for Authorization to Transport rifles
and shotguns for hunting and target practice, but that will probably
come in soon after the Liberals get re-elected -- if they do.

If you are carrying because your "Employment" requires it, the fee is
$40 per year.  We have two major armored car companies in Canada, each
with about 2500 employees who carry guns.  Their overhead just went up
by 40 X 2500 = $100,000.

Add to that the information dropped -- casually -- in the course of the
conference call as Carolyn St-Denis (CFC Senior Policy Analyst) briefed
the major dealers, armored car firms, and manufacturers that another
Liberal government department is going to require $400 armored vests
for every armed employee, and that increased overhead goes to
$1,100,000 in the first year of Rock's Folly.

If you use the armored car service, expect your fees to jump sharply.

A final word: Because _you_ have now become part of the huge voting
bloc that is the Canadian firearms community -- because _you_ are now
being courted by the Reform Party and the Conservative Party -- both of
which are promising _you_ that they will repeal Bill C-68 if you will
only vote them into office --

The Liberals are strongly considering putting Rock's Folly back on the
shelf until _after_ the election.  They still think that you are too
stupid to work or vote against them unless they are actively attacking
you on voting day.

Boy, are they stupid.  Do you think that accounts for the fact that
they ran Canada $600 billion in debt -- to buy soup?

Stay tuned for the latest news...

"Everyone told me that it was impossible to weld the Canadian firearms
community into a voting bloc.  Then they told me why it was
impossible.  Then I -- and a few good people who shared the vision --
went out and did it."

In summary, Bill C-68 is a corrupt and greedy act.  The Canadian government
is seeking control over the citizens of Canada (or rather, Communista) through
this bill.  The fees that they seek (as described in the above C-68 Firearms
Fees article by Dave Tomlinson) for gun registration aren't just driven by
their need for greed.  It's much more sinister a plot than that.  Plus, the
Liberals "ain't done yet" in my opinion.  Amongst citizens that are gun owners,
there's great opposition to C-68, and with just cause.  The cost alone to
average hunters, gun collectors, etc. is potentially overwhelming.  Not to
mention the fact that they don't want Big Brother on their backs... and invading
their homes "in search of weapons".  I am completely against C-68, including
what it represents and foreshadows.  Hopefully this article (and the ones that
I've included in the Reports from the Front section) have given you some needed
information and insight into this corrupt government act.  I also hope that
strong actions are taken to prevent governments (not only in Canada) from
being able to restrict rights such as these.  Voting in elections for
politicians that "claim" to oppose C-68 or like acts isn't enough.  In fact,
it may lead you into a sense of false security.  I believe that a message must
be sent to show them that we aren't just going to sit on our hands and take it.
Indifference, silence and pacifism don't work.  Protect yourself by making sure
that you're informed.  I suggest that every Canadian citizen read C-68 very
thoroughly, try to discern the meaning and form your own opinions.  Most
importantly, don't let them disarm you without a fight.  Afterall, that is
what they want.  Their highest goal is a police state.

DRUGS DISCUSSION -                                                  {DRUGS}
THC content and meaning:

Chant this out loud and repeat until sufficiently brainwashed:

"Another missed opportunity to smoke crack in front of your child."
and
"Another missed opportunity to shoot up in front of your child."
and
"Another missed opportunity to discuss THC with your child."

Yes kids, it's time for another talk about drugs.  This month, I'm going
to explain why marijuana is such a dangerous and evil plant.  You see, it's
illegal and wrong to smoke it.  Plus, the THC that it contains will make
you stupid and lazy.  Smoking pot will turn you into a social outcast.  It
isn't cool.  So, don't give in to peer pressure... Blah.. Blah.. Blah.  :)

{Government propaganda ends}

Alright, now that I've mocked the Government for misinforming and trying
to influence everyone... I'll explain what the intention of this article is.
Since there are still some misconceptions out there about marijuana, THC,
what it is and what it does... I decided to write a short article to clarify
it.  In this article, I will provide facts and reliable information pertaining
to THC (TetraHydraCannabinol) in order to inform readers that may lack knowledge
and an understanding of it.  I'll try not to make it too boring.  :)

The chemical THC has not been proven to be addictive.  It's not lethal.  The
effects of it are temporary, not permanent.  Without getting too technical,
it basically alters receptors in your brain, temporarily.  That is what
gives you the feeling of being high.  Don't worry though, it won't bake your
brain.  :)  That's because THC isn't toxic and is not a narcotic.  There
hasn't been a single proven case of death that's directly caused by marijuana.
So, it's perfectly safe to smoke or ingest, and you won't die from it... or
"overdose" like you can with many other things.  In fact, the more potent it
is (the higher the content of THC), the better... since you won't have to
smoke as much of it to get high.  And the less you smoke, the better it is
for your health.  An even healthier alternative is to eat it.  If you do that
instead of smoking it, (or smoking it with tobacco), then all of the harmful
smoke that your lungs would've absorbed is avoided.  If you don't want to eat
it then basically, the key is to buy very potent pot so that you only have
to smoke small quantities.  Also, resin isn't a good indicator of potency.
Some varieties of marijuana may have a high amount of resin and not be very
potent at all, since a lot of the resin is made up of inactive ingredients
instead of active cannaboids (like THC).  There have been some scientific
studies done on resin content that found it's not correlated with the potency.
So, it doesn't matter if a variety of marijuana has a lot of resin glands or
is resinous by nature.  In fact, the better varieties are non-resinous and
are extremely potent... as resin can induce coughing and doesn't add to the
effects.  In other words, it won't get you high so it's not something that you
want to exist in high amounts in marijuana.

I found this Family Council on Drug Awareness pamphlet while doing some drug
research.  Since it's informative and interesting, I decided to include it
in my article for chronics and newbies to read.  :)

   10 Things Every Parent, Teenager & Teacher Should Know

                       About

                     Marijuana


  "Prohibition...goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to
   control a man's appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things
   that are not crimes. A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
   principles upon which our government was founded."

  1 Q. What is Marijuana?

    A. "Marijuana" refers to the dried leaves and flowers of the cannabis
       plant [1], which contain the non-narcotic chemical THC at various
       potencies. It is smoked or eaten to produce the feeling of being
       "high." The different strains of this herb produce different sensual
       effects, ranging from sedative to stimulant.

  2 Q. Who Uses Marijuana?

    A. There is no simple profile of a typical marijuana user. It has been
       used for 1000s of years for medical, social, and religious reasons
       and for relaxation [2]. Several of our Presidents [3] are believed
       to have smoked it. One out of every five Americans say they have
       tried it. And it is still popular among artists, writers, musicians,
       activists, lawyers, inventors, working people, etc.

  3 Q. How Long Have People Been Using Marijuana?

    A. Marijuana has been used since ancient times [4]. While field hands
       and working people have often smoked the raw plant, aristocrats
       historically prefer hashish [5] made from the cured flowers of the
       plant. It was not seen as a problem until a calculated disinformation
       [sic] campaign was launched in the 1930s [6], and the first American
       laws against using it were passed [7].

  4 Q. Is Marijuana Addictive?

    A. No, it is not [8]. Most users are moderate consumers who smoke it
       socially to relax. We now know that 10% of our population have
       "addictive personalities" and they are neither more nor less
       likely to overindulge in cannabis than in anything else. On a
       relative scale, marijuana is less habit forming than either sugar
       or chocolate but more so than anchovies. Sociologists report a general
       pattern of marijuana use that peaks in the early adult years, followed
       by a period of levelling off and then a gradual reduction in use [9].

  5 Q. Has Anyone Ever Died From Smoking Marijuana?

    A. No; not one single case, not ever. THC is one of the few chemicals for
       which there is no known toxic amount [10]. The federal agency NIDA says
       that autopsies reveal that 75 people per year are high on marijuana
       when they die: this does not mean that marijuana caused or was even a
       factor in their deaths. The chart below compares the number of deaths
       attributable to selected substances in a typical year:

       Tobacco...............................340,000 - 395,000
       Alcohol (excluding crime/accidents).............125,000+
       Drug Overdose (prescription)............24,000 - 27,000
       Drug Overdose (illegal)...................3,800 - 5,200
       Marijuana.............................................0

       *Source: U.S. Government Bureau of Mortality Statistics, 1987

  6 Q. Does Marijuana Lead to Crime and/or Hard Drugs?

    A. No [11]. The only crime most marijuana users commit is that they use
       marijuana. And, while many people who abuse dangerous drugs also smoke
       marijuana, the old "stepping stone" theory is now discredited, since
       virtually all of them started out "using" legal drugs like sugar,
       coffee, cigarettes, alcohol, etc.

  7 Q. Does Marijuana Make People Violent?

    A. No. In fact, Federal Bureau of Narcotics director Harry Anslinger once
       told Congress just the opposite - that it leads to non-violence and
       pacifism [12]. If he was telling the truth (which he and key federal
       agencies have not often done regarding marijuana), then re-legalizing
       marijuana should be considered as one way to curb violence in our
       cities. The simple fact is that marijuana does not change your basic
       personality. The government says that over 20 million Americans still
       smoke it, probably including some of the nicest people you know.

  8 Q. How Does Marijuana Affect Your Health?

    A. Smoking anything is not healthy, but marijuana is less dangerous than
       tobacco and people smoke less of it at a time. This health risk can
       be avoided by eating the plant instead of smoking it [13], or can be
       reduced by smoking smaller amounts of stronger marijuana. There is
       no proof that marijuana causes serious health or sexual problems [14]
       but, like alcohol, its use by children or adolescents is discouraged.
       Cannabis is a medicinal herb that has hundreds of proven, valuable
       theraputic uses - from stress reduction to glaucoma to asthma to
       cancer therapy, etc. [15].

  9 Q. What About All Those Scary Statistics and Studies?

    A. Most were prepared as scare tactics for the government by Dr. Gabriel
       Nahas, and were so biased and unscientific that Nahas was fired by
       the National Institute of Health [16] and finally renounced his own
       studies as meaningless [17]. For one experiment, he suffocated monkeys
       for five minutes at a time, using proportionately more smoke than the
       average user inhales in an entire lifetime [18]. The other studies
       that claim sensational health risks are also suspect, since they lack
       controls and produce results which cannot be replicated or
       independently verified [19].

 10 Q. What Can I Do About Marijuana?

    A. No independent government panel that has studied marijuana has ever
       recommended jail for users [20]. Concerned persons should therefore
       ask their legislators to re-legalize and tax this plant, subject to
       age limits and regulations similar to those on alcohol and tobacco.

I hope that you've enjoyed reading this article and learned something from
it.  If anyone has any plans for bongs, send them in to be published in the
next issue.  I'm considering doing a one-time "bong review" and will need to
look at and try many different types of bongs first.  :)  In future articles,
I would like to write about the benefits of eating marijuana, how to grow
your own plants (hydroponically and outdoors), what type of bud (ie, various
strains from different countries) is the best, etc.  However, I don't want to
be limited to writing articles on drugs.  So, if you have any interesting drug
experiences that you want to share, then write an article and send it in.
The topic doesn't have to be marijuana.  It can be about acid, hash, mushrooms,
or any other drug of your choice.  Personally, I'd like to read some articles
on drugs from a reader's perspective for a change.

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                            {H/P}
How to hax0r your modem and Conferencing.

         --- Save your marriage/Keep peace in your parent's house ---
          --- A helpful tip for late night scanning or hacking ---
                        --- Courtesy of Damage, INC. ---

Are you a busy person that has a passion for h/p?  Do you spend all day at
work, school or other critically important endeavours?  That doesn't leave a lot
of time for h/p.  So you burn the midnight oil to find some interesting codes,
and to take advantage of them.

While using a wardialier like ToneLoc for some tasks like scanning, hacking
a PBX dial-out, a VMB, or an extender you may choose to have your modem
speaker on.  However, most modem speakers are very small speakers that deliver
very poor sound quality.  Plus, most modems, whether internal or external, do
not have a volume control.  As you probably know, ATMn is extremely limited...
either ON or OFF.  :-(

If your modem's crappy little speaker is delivering its distorted sound at
4:00am, there may be some very upset family members.  Especially if you don't
want them to know about your h/p activities.  ;-)

Fortunately, Damage, INC. has come up with a potential solution for that
problem.  If you have an old 2400 or 1200 baud modem collecting dust in an
obscure corner of your closet, it can still serve very nicely for the tasks
I listed above.  After all, you aren't using your old modem to connect to a
carrier, so it doesn't matter what speed it is, right?  With some very minor
modifications, you can transform your loyal old modem into a nice, silent
scanning/code hacking modem for ToneLoc... while those that live with you sleep
peacefully.  That's right, it's hax0ring your old modem and putting it to good
use again.

Reminder:  Please reread the Damage, INC. Disclaimer at the top of the
           Damage, INC. Newsletter before doing anything.  I (Shatazar)
           performed the following operation on my own external Incomm 2400 baud
           modem, and it operates perfectly.  If you fuck up in any way, it is
           your problem.  Damage, INC. is not responsible for your mistakes.

Items needed:

1 - External modem (preferably an old modem you no longer use)
1 - Female mini-headphone jack (Walkman sized jack)
1 - Soldering iron/gun
1 - Screwdriver
1 - Drill with various bits
Some solder (rosin core worked fine for me)
Some electrical tape

Note:  You can obtain a female mini-headphone jack from various sources.  If
       you have a walkman extension cord or y-adapter, you can cut off a/the
       female end, strip the insulation, and bare the ends of both wires that
       go into the female jack.

1>  Use your screwdriver to open up your old external.  Some old modems
    have to actually be pried open (like my old Incomm 2400).

2>  Look for two wires that goes from the modem circuit board to leads on the
    modem speaker.  Use your soldering iron/gun to disconnect the solder
    joints between the wires and the speaker.

3>  Splice/crimp together the wires from the female mini-headphone jack and
    the two wires connected to the modem circuit board.  Then solder the two
    wires together.  It is a good idea to match up wire colours whenever
    possible.  That way if a poor solder joint breaks, you can match up wires
    quickly.  Be sure that a good wetting action has occurred.

4>  Using electrical tape, wrap tape around both individual wires.  Then
    wrap electrical tape around both wires together.

Next you can use your drill, with an appropriate bit, to snugly mount your
female mini-headphone jack into your modem case.  Since modems have various
case styles, it is up to you to secure the jack to your own particular modem
case.  Then put your case back together with screws or electrical tape.

With a mini-headphone jack instead of your old modem speaker, you now have many
more options when using your modem to scan with or hack.  You can now plug in a
pair of Walkman headphones, a pair of those Labtec-styled speakers, or better
yet, your home stereo system into your old modem.  You can now scan or hack into
the early hours of the morning without bitching and questions from the people
you live with.

                                Field Phreaking:
                               An Introduction to
                                  Conferencing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this article, I will introduce you to the world of teleconferencing.  If
you're a novice phreak, it'll serve as an introduction.  If you're already
an experienced phreak that's setup/participated in conferences, then look at
it as merely an overview.  It might include some methods that you haven't
thought of or used already.  Besides, there have already been many text files
written on conferencing over the years.  Therefore, there's no reason to
go into tremendous detail and cover every type of conference.


Background:
----------

In the early days of phreaking, there were many large conferences with phreaks
from all over North America involved at any given time.  Some of them were
fairly well known and lasted indefinitely.  As in, for days, weeks or months
at a time.  :)  Some of them were through Telex test trunk lines that weren't
being used, which is why they lasted so long without being shut down.  A phreak
could join by simply sending out (or "blowing") a 2600 HZ tone down the trunk.
All that was required back then was a blue box.  There were also many known
loops and dial-in bridges etc. in which conferences were going on.  But of
course, things change and have changed... And in this article, I'm not going
to explain blue boxing.  Nor will I discuss "Blue Boxing in the 90s", C5
trunks, dialers like Scavenger etc.  I'll leave that for another article.  :)
All of the methods that I will discuss don't require a blue box.


Methods:
-------

First, I suggest that you don't setup the conference from home.  Even if
you divert, and believe that you're safe, it's still not a good idea to
try it.  So, to lessen your chance of being caught, beige box to set it
up, use a pay phone, or find a junction box.  As always, dial an ANI to
find out the number of the line that you're using.  Write it down so that you
can give it to the Conference Op when they ask what number to bill it to.  To
find a line with call waiting, use *70 to check for the beeps (short dialtones).
Once you find a suitable (open/unused line) with the call waiting option, use it
to call the Conference Operator (like a 1-800 AT&T Op assisted Conference line).
Tell them that you want the conference billed to your line and give them the
number.  Then, after you've hung up... call a number to a line that you know
rings and doesn't answer or a VMB that you know you can sit on few a few minutes
without being disconnected.  When you hear the beeps, that's the Op calling you
to confirm.  So, click over and confirm that you want to setup a conference
billed to your line.  That way, the owner of the line won't hear the phone
ringing (or pickup to answer it) when the Op tries to call you for confirmation.
It's much more stealthful, safe and avoids interruptions.  That's just a useful
tip for those pesky Operator call backs to confirm conferences, or call backs of
any type.  But that should be self-explanatory.

There are many ways that you can setup a conference.  You can use a 1-800
PBX that supports Alliance Teleconferencing.  Some VMBs support conferencing
as well.  Or, you can use a dial-in bridge... local loop... dial up an
AT&T Operator (or hit "0" for a local Operator) and get them to setup the
conference for you.  You can setup conferences ahead of time.  Just tell
the Op what dates, times (like 11:00pm for whatever time zone you're in),
the number of ports and to bill it to the number you're calling from.  Or,
you can use third party billing to have the conference billed to another
number.  In that case, bring a friend along with you while beige boxing.
Instruct them to answer the phone and confirm that they will accept the
charges.  For example, they could answer using another line with "Phreak
Computers.  Jim speaking.  How may I help you?"  The Op will ask if they
accept the conference being billed to them, and they just have to respond
with "Yes, I accept."  Keep it short and sweet.  :)  You can also give them
the number of a loop for third party billing... and have a friend waiting
for the Op to call.  When the Operator calls, the person on the loop should
hear a click.  They should answer "Hello?" and then when asked to confirm
that a Conference can be billed to that number, answer "Yes, I accept."
If they're not nervous and sound convincing, they should have no trouble.
Then the conference will be billed to the loop.  :)  Or, if you can find a
"dead" (silent) line, you can use that for third party billing as well.  It's
the same as above, when you hear the click, or clicks, answer with "Hello?"
and confirm the billing of the conference or anything else.

If you can find a COCOT (Customer Owned Coin Operated Telephone), which in
some areas is highly unlikely, then you can setup a conference from there
easily.  But they're rare.  If you do manage to find one, it'll be able to take
incoming calls and you can bill things to the pay phone.  The reason is that
it won't show up as a pay phone on the Op's computer screen.  But most pay
phones (at least in North America) won't allow you to receive incoming calls, so
conferences can't be billed to them using the above method.  However, you can
call from a pay phone and try to use third party billing to have the conference
billed to another number (that isn't a pay phone).  You just need to know the
number for billing and have a friend waiting there to answer and confirm.  They
could be waiting on a loop or at a junction box or anywhere else.  :)

You can conference through 1-800 PBXs as well, if you know how to dial out
from them.  If you are planning on dialing out from home through a PBX in order
to conference, you should divert by dialing out through several other PBXs,
VMBs, diverters or using another method... Just enter the passcode and then
the conference code (for Alliance Teleconferencing).  There are three branches,
1000, 2000, 3000.  So, 100X, 200X, 300X.  I won't list all of the codes though,
since they are already included in many other text files.  So, if you plan on
using this method, then read some text files written strictly on Alliance
Conferencing.  Some of the basic commands are listed below in this article.

Using loops to conference was explained in an earlier article in the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Simple scan to find them and usually you just dial
the loop to join in any conferences that are going on.  If you manage to find
a multi-line loop (they're rare), then you're lucky.  Or, you might scan and
find that some lines are connected for the purpose of conferencing.  Usually
it's best with loops if the conferences are pre-arranged.  Just invite certain
people to call it at the designated time.  But occasionally you'll run across
some phreaks that you don't know on loops, which is a good way to meet other
phreaks.  Once in a while you might encounter an Op or a lineman using them as
well.  If you don't hassle them, you might be able to carry on some interesting
conversations or social engineer them for info.

3-Way calling is another method.  You can set that up on a line while beige
boxing, but obviously it's limited.  Those types of small conferences are
alright if you just want to talk with a couple of phriends.

Bell also has their own conference system, as do a few other companies.  There
are text files available that list numbers of various companies that offer
conference services.  However, some are only available in certain areas, so
it's pointless to list them all in this article.  Plus, some of the numbers
might've changed since I last checked them out... and many were located in
American cities.

You can dial "0" and get the local operator to put you through to a Conference
Operator.  They can set up the conference for you.  It's not the best method,
but it should work almost anywhere in a pinch.

VMBs/VMS - I'm going to leave this particular conferencing method for a future
article.  I'll just tell you that some support internal conferencing.  So,
get out there and explore.

In order to find some of the things listed above, you may need to do some
scanning or social engineering.  That is, unless you have a list of numbers
already to use, from a text file, scan lists or a phriend.  I'm not going
to provide you with AT&T Conference numbers, ANIs, PBXs, VMBs, or lines that
ring or ring busy (BUSYs) etc.  Also, you should think and experiment with
some of your own ways and methods to conference as well.  Not all methods
were listed in this article, so that it could remain relatively brief and
concise.  Hopefully the above methods discussed are clear and understandable
to everyone though, as they aren't complex or difficult to use.


Basic Commands of AT&T's Alliance System:
----------------------------------------

The general commands are "#" to add and "*" to cancel.  Meaning, to add
someone to the conference, you press the "#" button and dial their phone
number (1+NPA+XXX-XXXX).  To prevent someone from accessing it, you would
press "*" before adding them and they won't be permitted to join.  Entering
"#6" and then the person's number will transfer control of the conference
to them.  To get a conference operator, hit "#7".  To go into silent mode,
press "#9".  You'll be able to hear the others in silent mode, but they can't
hear you.  And press "#" to rejoin them.  While you are conferencing, "#" takes
you to command mode.  While there, you are temporarily out of the conference.
The others won't be able to hear you and they can continue talking.  If you want
to leave the conference, press "*" to disconnect/hang up.  Those are just some
basic commands for Alliance Teleconferencing.  It's very user friendly, so you
shouldn't have any problems.  Obviously, these commands don't apply to other
things such as loops... in which you're not in control.


Tips:
----

Don't use loops or conferences that were setup by an Operator to exchange
codes or information that could get you busted.  Also, don't give out names,
phone numbers and other sensitive info while conferencing.  You don't know if
they're listening in and recording or not.  So, in the interest of safety, it's
not a good practice to do that.

If you are field phreaking, use the call waiting method that I described
above.  It's a way to be stealthful and prevents a lot of problems from
happening while you're borrowing a line.

Be prepared.  As in, if you're field phreaking then bring along everything
that you'll need.  That includes a pen, paper, beige box, an ANI number to use,
AT&T Conference numbers, etc.  Basically, make sure you have all that will
be required to setup a conference.  You might also want to make sure some of
the people that you want involved will be around to join it.  :)

Try not to be predictable.  Don't keep using the same method, from the same
place, at the same time.  Be as random as possible to avoid getting caught.
If you use PBXs, don't keep using the same ones over and over again etc.
In other words, be intelligent and think about what you're doing before you
do it.  Otherwise, it's only a matter of time before someone puts an end
to your $1000+ conference calls.  :)  Just remember, they are billed by the
minute to the owner of the line that's in control of the conference.  That
includes the number of ports used.  The charges can really add up fast.
I shouldn't have to give you an example of what a 10 port conference for
4 hours costs, as the price per minute can vary.

You may even want to divert by dialing through a PBX, even if you're at a
pay phone or beige boxing.  That is, if you're using third party billing.
If you are billing to the number that you're using, you can't divert as that
number will show up on ANI.  If you beige box to setup conferences, don't keep
using the same location... or set them up at the same times etc.  Obviously,
you shouldn't use the same pay phone each time you setup a conference either.

Also, don't abuse the hell out of them.  And if you're setting up a conference,
it's a good idea to limit the number of ports to 10 or so.  That way, there
aren't too many people talking at once.  Plus, if it's setup by the Op, they
won't be as suspicious as if you say that you will require 20 ports for a
5 hour long conference.  :)  So, limit the amount of ports to 10 or so and
the duration to 2-3 hours.  If you set it up before midnight, you'll get more
conference time automatically.  Just use your own common sense in order to
avoid arousing suspicion or getting busted.


Conclusion:
----------

Overall, Conferencing is a lot of phun.  It's a great way to meet other phreaks,
especially ones that are in another NPA.  You can exchange information, plan
meetings, or just talk to some phriends that are ld.  It used to be one of
the main ways for phreaks and "telecommunications enthusiasts" to converse with
each other.  But now, with Email and shit like IRC, there don't seem to be
quite as many going on anymore.  Perhaps I just miss the good old days.  Or,
maybe the internet is killing certain things, besides just h/p boards.  Then
again, it might just be that the new generation isn't as interested in setting
up conferences, exploring the telco and using what they find.  I don't know
what the reason is.  However, I do hope that some people benefit from reading
this short article and become more actively involved in the phreak scene.  Until
the next time, enjoy yourself and always remember to phreak safely...

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL is temporarily down.  I've been experiencing some
hard drive problems etc.  However, users can still call and download the
most recent issue by hitting "D" at the security logon menu and using a
login of "GUEST" password "DAMAGE".  The board should be online and fully
operational again soon.

The next issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter may not be released in November
due to time constraints and lack of writers.  In fact, we might have to start
releasing issues on a bi-monthly basis.  Personally, I'd like it to remain a
monthly newsletter, but it may be necessary to change.  Unfortunately, we
weren't able to release this issue in September, as originally planned.  But,
that doesn't mean we're calling it quits.  You can expect new issues to be
released, regardless of any problems that we encounter.  We just won't be
able to release them as frequently as in the past.

I've been attempting to recruit some quality writers for the Damage, INC.
Newsletter.  However, it's not easy to find people that are willing to
spend time writing articles and make a contribution.  If you're interested,
contact us.  We're also looking for ansi, ascii and VGA art work.  Some
people (Count Zero of iCE, greent, Deezack and others) have already made
contributions, but the web site still needs work.  I'm not an ansi/VGA artist
by any means.  So, if you're an artist and want to draw a Damage, INC. logo,
then it would be greatly appreciated.  We can't afford to pay anything for
art work though.  ;)

Yes, we're still looking for quality h/p related boards in various area codes,
countries and continents to become Damage, INC. Dist. Sites.  So, if you're
interested, then contact us at damage_inc@mailcity.com.  Make sure you include
all of the necessary info about your board (name, number, type of system, what
it supports, how long it has been online, any nets that it carries, etc.) in
Email.  Any other information that you feel is important should also be
included.  If your board isn't multi-node, doesn't have gigs of storage, have
affiliations etc. don't worry about it.  As long as the board is stable,
supports h/p and is somewhat "established", then apply.

Fatal Vision recently quit Damage, INC. due to lack of time/interest.  He
and his board, PSYCOSiS are no longer affiliated with Damage, INC. in any way.
Regretfully, it was advertised in the Crossed Wires section as being online
24/7 and was down shortly after issue #11 was released.  I don't know what the
status of his board is now.  It could be up or it could be down.  Hopefully that
bbs advertisement didn't affect and mislead too many of our readers that
might've been trying to call it.  If it did, then I apologize for the
inconvenience that it caused.  Fatal Vision had assured me beforehand that it
would be up and running by the time it was advertised, but obviously that wasn't
the case since it was ringing for days... Ah well.  I can't control what other
people do with their boards.  Nor do I have anything to do with his board.  But
in the future, only boards that are more reliable and established will be
advertised in the Damage, INC. Newsletter.


INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}
An interview with Fringe.

<B> = BLACKENED
Fringe's answers and comments are obviously underneath what I wrote.  ;)


<B> - Introduce yourself to the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter...

My handle is fringe, and my real name isn't.  I've only been asked once before
to do an interview.. and I declined.. it was for a cheesy public access cable 
show.. This seems a little more subtle, so, hey, I'll go wacky.
basix on me: I tend to reside in the chicagoland area. I'm the editor of the 
pimp e-zine (also a writer).. and I'm 4'2", 600 lbs.  I had to add the last 
part in.. so no one plans on stalking me.

<B> - How long have you been involved in the h/p scene?

	I've been involved with the h/p scene for quite some time.  During the 
late 80's, early 90's, I was more into phreaking then anything.  When I was in 
7th grade, a lineman was doing a ringback on a payfone, and was actually cool 
enough to tell me what he did.  I had the insane need to learn more. 
Eventually, I think it was in 91.., I got my first computer.  

	It was a Commodore 64.. and a lightning storm eventually took its life. 
To this day, I still think it beats out any microsoft based boxes. Presently, I 
use an amiga 600 to do all my stuff.. and a coupla 286's.


<B> - How long has your board, Apocalypse 2000 been online?  Describe what
it's about and what types of things it supports.

	I've only been a sysop of apocalypse 2000 for about 4 years, but the 
BBS itself has been around since 1992.  Subhuman and Jello Biafra are the 
creators of it and did they ever pick a fitting name. It is utilized for the 
free open discussion of hacking, phreaking, conspiracies, politics, narcotics,
and almost any other topic that relates to the h/p scene of today.  We do not 
have warez, and we cannot permit the posting of codes of any sort. There have
been some "situations" in the past that have brought us to a more paranoid 
state.  

	If you want to find out more about the BBS, http://dope.org/pimp/apoc2k/
and on the web site, you will find a timeline, email links to all the sysops, 
and any news in regards to the ssh connection we are setting up to the BBS.


<B> - When was PIMP magazine started?  What is it about?  What are the goals?

	Well.. probe industries was just kind of a company name myself and 
an exfriend used when going on various missions (you know what I mean, if you 
don't .. nevermind).  Over time,.. I had started writing philes.. and noticed 
the degradation of quality ezines in the scene.  So many had come out of 
nowhere and had so much idiocy in them.  How to blow up your school.  How 
to make the ereet red b0x 10 different ways.  How to beige box off of your 
neighbors line.  Idiocy.. there was a complete loss of ethix in everything 
I was reading.  So, we just started getting together anything I had written, 
and any more dox that we could and created "probe industries magazine philes, 
aka pimp".  About 2 years ago, I set up the web site (http://dope.org/pimp/) 
and although the scale of readers and writers is small, the magazine stays 
true to its nature and has some very valuable resources.  The goal of the 
magazine is to educate, to spread the word, yet to do it discreetly.   The 
magazine stays strictly dedicated to h/p and conspiracies or other things of 
importance to the h/p underworld.



<B> - How has PIMP changed since the first issue was released?  Basically,
how has it evolved?

	The magazine format and depth has changed a lot.  The amount of writers
has gone from myself to about 8 or so people.  The exfriend has since left and
lost the affiliation due to his lack of respect for people and business 
within the group. We haven't heard from him. The original issue just had a 
lot of dox on programming various cell phones and was initially created / 
released to start the magazine.  I even went as far as to put some cbi dialups 
I found in that issue just to make it seem more valuable.   Since then, thru 
time and more data, we have gotten a lot more organized and have various 
sections for articles and inpho.  I try to include scene news in every issue, 
but by the time it gets out, it's usually old news.  I have no idea what the 
future plans are for it.. in fact, a few months ago, the magazine was dead.  
There was nothing new to be said.. no one had anything they wanted to submit, 
and I had little time to do anything myself.  I'd like to establish some form 
of release date,. but there really never has been any.  Whenever we can 
get it out we do.  If we get something decent submitted, it's added.


<B> - As the editor of PIMP, do you find that it's difficult to get
people to write articles and contribute?  And has it been difficult to
keep releasing issues?

	It all depends what mood people are in.  I'm trying hard not to rip on 
anyone here, but I have noticed that a vast majority of the h/p world has turned
to living on the net, and it's not all that good of a thing.  I have qualms
with it.  Scr1pt k1dd13s are everywhere, and no one believes in learning 
anything more than compiling c programs to attack sites.. very few bother even 
learning unix and networking, except to get around.  It's been extremely 
difficult to keep releasing issues and getting articles.  I'm not the only 
sysop of apocalypse 2k so that hasn't really slowed me down.  The web site 
(dope.org) is run by stash, a good friend and pimp who has given me space for 
all these pages.  The pimp site, apoc site, and my own page are all worked on 
in my free time.  Web stuff is part of what I do for a living.. so it takes me 
little time.  Subhuman / Devolve has spent an insane amount of time doing the 
graphix for both the pimp and apoc sites.  I just set em up.  The greatest 
difficulty in all, is just finding new things to put in the zine; keeping 
with its theme.



<B> - What does it mean to be a PIMP?

... y0wza, hard question.  To be a writer for pimp.. means that you want to 
broaden other peoples horizons mentally.. and to let them know inphormation 
that isn't normally all too easy to get.  At times, the zine can be very 
technically oriented.  It may sound hippyish when I say this.. but it's all 
about bringing the power to the people.. the scene.. the h/p underworld.. 
those that live in the grey area like we do.


<B> - Can anyone write articles and submit them to PIMP?  Where should they
be sent?  How can people contact you and/or PIMP?

	Yes, in fact it's encouraged.  All submissions can be sent to 
pimp@dope.org and will be reviewed by various established members for accuracy
and if it substantial to the mag.  On the norm, most everything we get, gets 
published.


<B> - How does someone join PIMP as a member?  Can people apply or is
becoming a member by invitation only?

	If there is some way you would like to help out with the magazine, 
then chances are you can become a part.  Admitted, there are core members
that have known each other for years, and don't necessarily trust everyone 
else as much.  Basically, if you want to join and have something to offer,
it's all good.  An email gets sent out to all current members to let them 
know who is joining, and to ask if anyone has any problems with said 
individual joining.  Usually, there isn't a problem.


<B> - Are you still actively involved in h/p?  What do you think of the
current h/p scene?  How is the local scene in Chicago?

	I am,.. and I'm not.  I have had a discrepancy with ameritech for 
almost two years now and do not have my own landline.  I partake in various 
projects here and there and still read, study, learn as much as I can.  The
current h/p scene I have problems with.  Too much is taken for granted.  
too many people are trusting too many other people way too much.  I have a 
few contacts i've established over the years in various countries,.. and I 
trust them somewhat.. but I think today's scene is littered with script kiddies
and aol hackers.  Kids who think compiling a c program to attack some site is 
hacking.  Not once taking a look at the code and really trying to understand 
what is taking place. 

	The local scene in chicago is doing pretty well.  A lot of new people 
have come about in the past few years, and an even greater amount have 
disappeared.  It seems that every coupla years, the scene evolves massively 
out here.  Everytime it does, some good comes out of it and some bad.  There 
have been a few little narc kiddies and some people who have violated other 
peoples well being out here.. but those situations get handled as they come.. 
and they just remind everyone why you can't intially give anyone trust. 
Trust should be earned. (in my opinion).


<B> - Do you read any h/p zines?  If so, please list a few of them.

Truthfully, I read a bare minimum.  I wish I could find more out there of 
substance.. I once in a while read 2600 for laughs, phrack for a few good 
articles out of the mag.. and the one zine I hold true respect for is 9x.. 
stash's dope.org hosts them as well (http://www2.dope.org/9x).  That group 
has come a long way and has helped to keep things real.  I hate using the 
term real, but it is extremely fitting.   I'm probably missing mags that I 
do read.. but I cannot think of any others that are really all that good.  
Most are a joke.

Think about blacklisted 411,.. how to be a theif is basically all it's about.

<B> - Which h/p groups, if any do you respect?  

Hmm. Tricky.  I respected AoD's passion (academy of deception, I was a member 
in 95 or so..).. amitech, for knowing what they were doing.  Their one bbs in 
516... was nice while it lasted.  9x, as I said above, I respect for staying 
true to the scene.. one of the last few diehard mags.  Most of the groups I 
knew weren't necessarily organizations, but scenes in other countries and 
cities.  516 had a great scene for years while I frequent'ed it.  As did 514 
(underworld was a damn good board).. as did +31 (the netherlands had a great 
bbs scene).. as did germany.. the list can go on for a long time.  I pretty 
much gave a ton of shout outs to boards I used to call on my web page for 
bbses.  (http://dope.org/fringe/bbses.html)


<B> - Have you ever... at any time considered joining another group?
If so, which one(s) and why?

I was part of academy of deception (AoD).. a group that never really took 
off due to lack of organization (but our hearts were in it haha). It was 
dedicated to bringing people up to speed with the current h/p scene and also 
to keep things afloat.  the groups whq was on the digital fallout in 516 years 
back.  Eventually, edgewise took the board down (he had to go to college or 
sumthin.. damns it) and the group fell.  I considered submitting dox to 9x,.. 
however, whenever I get something new.. I usually end up throwing it in pimp.  
Eventually i'll get some dox to substance for 9x.  We're all associates.  
There is no competition.. it's all about free inpho.. and inpho meant to be 
free.  At this time, I don't plan to join any other groups.. because most 
groups of today are just so people can attempt to make a name for themselves.  
I won't bring up specifics.. but everyone wants to make some idiot claim to 
fame, so they can feel 'eleet' and be bad asses when it comes to hax0r events 
like defcon.  In reality, most of these people are idiots and script kids and 
wouldn't know the difference between a vax dialup and a rolm dialup.  It's 
funny how many groups and people 'affiliated' with these groups that there 
are out there now.  I remember some friends talking to a speaker at defcon 
who really didn't know his head from his ass.  But somehow, he was deemed a 
badass and looked up to by all the other script kids because he 'must' be 
sooo knowledgeable.. because he knows people that also are supposedly so 
knowledgable.  I think a claim to fame for any reason in the h/p underworld 
just proves what an idiot you are.  And I think 99.99% of the groups created 
in this day and age are created just for that reason.


<B> - Which web sites do you usually frequent?  ;)

	dope.org in all aspects (check out my web page dope.org/fringe 
for a tree of the dope phamily), disinfo.com, impropaganda.com, phreak.org, 
geek-girl.com, freerepublic.com, zdnet.com, x86.org, and i'm sure there's 
plenty more I just cannot think of right now.

<B> - Do you want to share any memorable hacking/phreaking experiences?
(achievements, strange things found, memorable or interesting hacks,
meetings, hacker cons, etc.)

	Interesting things found.. I didn't find this, but I'm pretty sure 
another sysop from the area did (i'm trying hard to keep names outta this). 
Most C.O.'s in chicagoland have a dialup loop to the PA system.  The loop is 
always located at the area code and prefix of that particular CO, and the last 
four digits are 9951, and 9952. (ie, 708-xxx-9951 is one end of the loop).  
Useful they are, but you will be broadcasting on the PA system while you talk.
Other things found.. very very very many useful computer systems.. locally and 
far away.. however i'll stop myself right there.  Because I really don't want 
to go into detail on any of that.

	I've found that you can con any cell one operator into believing you 
are the legitimate user.  Same goes for ameritech cell operators.  I recall 
having been out beige boxing in 8th grade.. and a gang fight broke out all 
over that neighborhood.  We didn't know what was worse.. the gang war or the 
cops everywhere.  Achievements.. is a lousy thing to think of.. for me, 
personally, I have achieved almost everything i've set out to do.. but I 
don't think achievements you make in h/p should ever be public knowledge 
like this.  It tends to make everything too glorified and glamourized.
The most interesting thing i've learned over the years is the con game 
implemented within anything you do.  It helps in taking over anything.. 
and that is a tool everyone should learn.

	The worst thing that has probably ever happened to me while trashing 
was coming back from a great sprint CO with a lot of ess dox.  My timing belt 
broke halfway home so we got picked up.. only our new ride lost control while
exiting the expressway and launched off the expressway, taking out a light 
post and rolling with the van ending upside down.  People were hurt, ess 
dox were all over the expressway, and it just plain sucked.  A very 
depressing night on many levels.

Call me superstitous, but I will never hit that sprint CO again.


<B> - Have you ever been busted?  Or, do you know anyone that's been busted?
If so, would you like to describe the event, the circumstances of the bust
and the conclusion?


	I haven't ever been busted.. although I've been threatened by an 
exfriend/cokehead that he'd turn me in. He changed his mind.  Once, on a 
board in germany, the sysop got a message from an administrator asking who was 
dialing into their router and calling to his system.  He posted it in the 
public bases. it went on about ameritech doing an investigation blah blah blah..
luckily, he did that.  I never got in trouble for it.. and I know ma bell ended
up paying for it.  Which to me, isn't a violation of ethix, because ma bell is
a money sucking bitch anyways. 

	As for anyone else who has been busted.. there have been a few scares 
out here.. and a few times people got busted for telco heists.  A friend even 
got pinched once for cell cables.  There's been various other arrests of 
friends and I have seen a lot of friends go to prison (not necessarily for 
h/p related crimes though).  Anyways, their business is their business.. and 
to put it simple enough, if you are doing something deemed extremely illegal.. 
try to keep it under wraps.. don't let the world be your alliance in whatever 
you are doing.   I truly, TRULY, do not partake in any illegal activities now.. 
Why? because I have too many other things to worry about.  And if I ever did.. 
I made sure of my surroundings and who I could trust.  We once had a sysadmin 
scanning our message bases on apocalypse 2k for his ISP's name.. he found it.. 
plenty.. and we found him.. and since little things like that happen here and 
there in time, we have tightened up security. 

	I recall the sysop of extreme dreams busting into chat with me one day..
he had news crews at his house and people wanting to interview him.  We had a 
good laff together.. then police came..  Why? Someone downloaded a file on how 
to make a coke machine bomb from his board.  Naturally, he had a bbs ad 
attached to the bottomed of this.  However, the person who downloaded this 
decided to fax it to some offices.. and scared people from using the coke 
machines.  They tried to blame extreme dreams for the cause.  It's a tricky 
world.. everyone needs a scapegoat.	



<B> - Do you want to mention any boards that you call or people in the scene
that you know?

There's a lot of people out there I truly appreciate in the scene.. 

Werd to the people who i've known for years and have been true to the scene:
subhuman, stash, silo, jello biafra, trainwreck, insane lineman, goodbytes,
burning horizon, nothing absolutely and absolutely nothing, luthor, special-k, 
morpheus, jopiter, omega, and van hauser.

Shouts to: everyone on the dope.org boxes, apocalypse 2k, the centre, and for 
further shout-outs, bbs shout-outs, etc, hit my web page..
http://dope.org/fringe/greets.html and http://dope.org/fringe/bbses.html


<B> - Are there any other interesting h/p experiences or general comments
that you have and wish to share?

Learn for the know-how and knowledge.. not for the abuse.  
Don't consider anyone who's been around for a long time to outweigh you in wit.


One norm of the h/p underworld:

Feedback about the Damage, INC. Newsletter:

This is your forum for feedback.  Direct all comments, questions, suggestions
and requests to damage_inc@mailcity.com.  There's been a noticable lack of
user response in recent months.  Hopefully, this issue will provoke a few
quality letters to the editor.  Otherwise, this section may be discontinued.

Have no phear MA$E is here :) You might have noticed I used the quote of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter #11 in this message because in my eyes, it reflected a
great newsletter which goes on the top of my list as one of my favourite.

This letter can be used as feedback if Blackie Lawless chooses. The reason I 
say Blackie Lawless, is because I have to tip my hat off to his articles in
this issue. The Conspiracies And Coverups section was one of my favourite 
articles, and probobly one of the best in all of the Damage, INC. Newsletters 
past articles, whether it be, h/p articles, creative writing, etc. Since I 
know alot about area-51 (also the name of my board) and read up on alot of
conspiracies this article really showed that you knew what you were talking
about (I was thinking of writing an article on MJ-12, Hanger-18, Area-51 to
clarify to everyone what it was since alot of people ask me, but their is no 
need now, since your article made it perfectly clear and offered a great 
opinion on the subject).  I liked the fact that you mentioned some of the
projects (which is hard to find text files on) put more then one project
together in your article (Plato, Sigma, Redlight, etc.), and that's what made
it quality.  All of your articles to date have been quality man.  On the top
of my list (in no order) are; Field Phreaking: Junction Boxes, Tips on
Scanning 1-800s (which benefitted me personally because I havent done any
scanning due to my telephone status: rotary/pulse dialing, so that benefitted
me, and if it benefitted me, chances are, it benefitted other newbies who are
going to get into it once they have learned the basics) and of course your
article on PBXs tops them all for me since I am a newbie that also helped me
and will help others :) I am sure there are a few I am missing, and can't
remember at this time.  I guess what I am saying is all of your articles have
been quality and wanted to write this feedback since no one has said much at
all about your work and wanted to make sure that people understand that your
articles are addictive but not lethal, you keep us honest, and we ain't seen
nothin' yet.

MA$E

Thanks alot for the generous compliments you've given me in your feedback.
Although it feels good to be singled out for my accomplishments in the
Damage, INC. Newsletter, it takes the efforts of every active Damage, INC.
Member in order to keep the quality level high.  As for the inclusion of this
feedback being up to me, it was actually up to BLACKENED.  He is the Editor of
the Damage, INC. Newsletter, so it was his decision.  However, being the
selfless individual that he is, he's given up his soapbox for two months now,
since most Damage, INC. feedback seems to be directed to individual members for
some reason.  :)  In any event, hopefully BLACKENED, Shatazar and THC Phreak
get some feedback on their articles someday...

I'm pleased that you found my Conspiracies and Coverups article about the
Majestic Twelve to be informative and factual.  I look at myself as being a
well-rounded person and not just involved in one interest, like h/p.  The
great UFO conspiracies do interest me, and I've spent many hours reading
materials about that subject.  My main intention was to enlighten some people
about the fact that there is evidence that the U.S. government is covering up
the alien presence on Earth.  As for including information on the various
government projects, I felt that it was important for readers to see the big
picture, how the projects link together, etc.  As for Hangar-18 and Area 51, I
didn't discuss those topics in any amount of detail.  Future articles could be
written about those topics, so if you still want to give it a try, go ahead.

Concerning your pulse dialing situation, you should definitely remedy that ASAP.
I'm glad you have benefitted from my h/p related articles though.  I hope that
other newbies gained something from them as well.  Continue reading and learning
and I'll continue to write articles.  That's right, you ain't seen nothin' yet!

OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
Gun Control = No Control.

There is a war that is being waged right now, but it is not with guns.  Rather
guns are the victims of the war, not the weapon of choice.  The way the insane,
liberal gun control lobbyists speak, they make it sound like guns are living,
sentient demons that slaughter innocent people every second of every day.  "Guns
kill!" is their greatest slogan.  I've heard their paranoid opinions, based on
misinformation and corrupt, hidden agendas.  Now it's my turn to share my
opinions regarding guns and gun control with all of the readers of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.

First of all, do guns kill people?  Haha... the last time I looked at a gun, it
didn't seem animated or evil to me.  In fact, it didn't look threatening at all.
The obvious fact that gun lobbyists refuse to acknowledge and absorb is that
*people kill people*.  A person can use a gun to kill another person.  That is
true... but a person can use his hands, or virtually any kind of object (both
natural or man-made) to kill another human being.  A gun is nothing more or
less than a tool that a person can use to preserve his life if reasonably
threatened.  Guns should not be viewed as murderous demons, but as a tool that
enables people to defend themselves, instead of being a helpless victim.

The next bit of propaganda that the gun control lobbyists spew are guns and
"our" (meaning "society's") children.  How many commercials, TV programs, and
movies have you seen where a stupid, careless parent places a loaded handgun
in the bedside table?  Then the little kid blows away his little sister or
brother.  Yes, it does happen occasionally in reality.  However, it is my firm
belief that those kind of accidental killings aren't necessary.  First of all,
the children have not been educated on how to properly handle a firearm.
Parents should teach, and allow their children to handle and properly
discharge guns.  The ignorance and naiveness of a child should be eliminated
through education... not depravation.  An educated child may not have the
curious desire to play with a handgun after its hiding place is discovered.
The child would know that it is not a plaything... but a tool to defend his
family from home invasion.

A child's home education of firearms should be *supplemented* by the school
system.  Children in primary school should gain further practice on how to
handle and use firearms in a Physical Education course.  I also believe that
high school students should also be able to take firearms courses to improve
their proficiency with firearms.  Once children and young adults are armed with
information, they'll be better prepared if they arm themselves with a poorly
hidden gun, or even if their own lives were threatened.  Secondly, parents could
use gun safes with a touch lock that's activated by a combination of presses
in the proper sequence to make it more difficult for ignorant children to gain
access to the handgun.  The gun could be stored safely away in the parents
room in the safe behind a locked door as well for added security.  Yet, the
handgun would still be close by and handy in case of an emergency.

What do you think of that?  Are you up in arms in protest?  If so, ask
yourselves "Why?"  Why would it be harmful for children to become knowledgable,
comfortable and proficient with firearms?  Is it because, deep down you have
no faith and trust in your children, or children around you?  Or do feel that it
would take too much time and effort to educate... and it would be easier to go
with the grain and eliminate access to guns of any type?  If that is your
attitude, then perhaps you should give up your parental rights instead of
supporting your children's ignorance of firearms.  Afterall, wouldn't that be
the easy way out?

Fortunately, there is an example of a country that requires and encourages
their citizens to be armed and ready.  In Switzerland, the citizens are the
army.  From the time a Swiss child is born, he or she is used to the presence of
firearms.  They may see their father cleaning and inspecting his military
assault rifle and ammunition in their home.  After all, it is in the Swiss
Constitution of 1874 that all men must keep their military rifle and ammunition
in their homes, so they can mobilize quickly in the event that Switzerland is
invaded.  After seeing the state of decay in Canada and the United States, it
is refreshing to see a country that has faith and trust in their own citizens.
Swiss citizens can possess long guns without any kind of certificate or
registration.  Registration is only reserved for machine guns, sub-machine
guns, howitzers, anti-aircraft or anti-tank weapons, and some handguns.  Despite
the fact that every Swiss house has some kind of firearm, gun crime is very low.
Perhaps that has something to do with the fact that there aren't many weak,
helpless people that are unable to arm and defend themselves in that country.

Citizens defending themselves using guns.  In my opinion, that is what
governments, cops, lobbyists, and their allies are really fighting against.
They want to take away our greatest tool for defending our lives, our property,
and our freedom.  A citizenry that isn't armed is vulnerable and weak to
exploitation.  It isn't a coincidence that as the government and their
supporters fight to strip us of legal ownership of firearms, cops want body
armour, hollow point bullets, fully-automatic assault rifles, etc.  An unarmed
population that relies on the police for protection becomes a police state.

Depending on where you live, the freedoms we used to enjoy, and still partially
enjoy, were earned by either ridding ourselves of oppressive internal forces, or
defense from outside forces.  However, with no obvious enemy threatening western
nations, the war is within borders now.  Once again there is a battle for
freedom.  The government passes laws and edicts in attempts to control our
actions and our thoughts.  The cops are becoming more aggressive, both in
weaponry and attitude.  It is obvious that the very people that are supposed to
be representing us and serving us do not trust us.  How do most idiots react to
that blatant disrespect and total mistrust?  They cave in, fearing to sacrifice
what our forefathers sacrificed in wars of independence or national defense.
Well, in my opinion freedom is not free.  Freedom must be fought for, and guns
are one important tool that can help individuals (or individuals that band
together) in that fight.  To those of you that believe in gun control and
bannings, I have one final comment for you all.  If you don't want to stand up
for your rights, that's fine... just don't tread on me and my rights.  I would
use a gun only in self-defense.  However, if you would rather trust Big Brother
and the Thought Police over me and others that believe in freedom, then you'll
get what you deserve when you're rights are all gone.  Because when freedom is
gone, so will all of us freedom fighters.

How To Register ANY Firearm Under C-68

Date: Tue, 5 Aug 1997 22:10:32 -0600
From: "David A. Tomlinson"
Subject: How To Register ANY Firearm Under C-68

RULES FOR REGISTRATION UNDER BILL C-68
DOWNLOAD, PRINT, COPY AND DISTRIBUTE; FORWARD AND POST EVERYWHERE.

What follows is education on the coming situation when C-68 comes into
force.  From the viewpoint of the NFA, we must do our best to protect
Canadians from both criminal charges and inconvenience that may arise from
the new registration system.  It is unfortunate WHEN our activities
conflict with the plans and desires of the government and its bureaucracies,
but the defective legislation has that result.

Where legislation is this complex and difficult, there will always be
opportunities concealed within it.  Where complex and difficult legislation
is written by people who do not understand the theory and practice of
regulatory well enough, there will be many opportunities.

Looking back at the development of firearms control law, it is obvious that
the writing of those laws by unqualified persons has been a major and
continuing defect.  The loss of 20 per cent of all registered firearms
(under the "re-register every 5 years" plan of 1939) in 1945 was a red
warning that the registration system did not and could not work.  The change
made in 1950 (making registration permanent) was a cover-up.  In 1950, if
that legislation had not passed, the second "re-register every 5-years"
wave of re-registration would have conclusively proven that the system did not
-- could not -- keep track of registered firearms.  The bureaucracies
persuaded the government to prevent the test from being made, and that was a
serious error.  We are still suffering from the results of that coverup.

The continuing problems include:

(a) The Department of Justice does NOT understand administrative law,
and, in particular, the rules regarding the establishment, powers,
limitations and structure of the system of indpependent quasi-judicial
one-person licensing tribunals.  Those tribunals are established by the
administrative and regulatory law improperly embedded in the current
Criminal Code and soon to be embedded in the revised Criminal Code and the
Firearms Act.  A crash program should be instituted by the CFC to determine
where its proposals are in violation of basic principles of administrative
and regulatory law.

I have suggested to the CFC that when such a program is started, that an
OUTSIDE lawyer or an OBJECTIVE lawyer new to the firearms field be
consulted, and that the NFA be asked to brief that lawyer on some of the
vulnerabilities the NFA has already detected and plans to attack.  (This
paper would be a good starting point for him or her.)  It will be most
embarrassing if much of the work now in progress turns out to be wasted
because those limitations were not considered, and much of the current CFC
output winds up being ruled illegal.

(b) The writers of definitions in the Firearms Act and revised
Criminal Code failed to deal with the fundamental problems caused by
defective definitions of "firearm", "weapon", "offensive weapon",
"restricted weapon/firearm", "prohibited weapon/firearm", etc. when they
had the chance.  The C-68 definitions are actually worse than those in current
law.  Those defects will give rise to the following patten of (legitimate!)
behavior by the firearms community.

What follows is NOT an attack on what the CFC and Registrar want to do and
plan to do.  It is a PROTECTION of the interests of the 40 per cent of
Canadian households that contain at least one recreational firearm.  Where
the plans of the Minister, the CFC and/or the Registrar can and/or will
have bad effects on Canadians, we have the right and the duty to tell Canadians
how to minimize the harmful effects that threaten them.  That is one of the
NFA's major reasons for existence.

This is an educational campaign.  "Where the law is written badly, the
results will NEVER be the desired results."

It is particularly unfortunate that we share common goals for DESIRED
RESULTS of firearms control legislation.  In our view, legislation that
WILL have those desired results cannot be drafted by people who do not have the
required intimate knowledge of firearms, firearms owners, firearms users,
and the firearms community's complex interactions.

Where that intimate knowledge is ignored, and the advice of police
agencies, lawyers and anti-firearms activists is taken, the resulting
legislation will be FULL of opportunites.  In the material below, you will
see how some of the C-68 opportunities will be used.

The current CFC plan is to have YOU apply to register your rifle or
shotgun, supplying ALL the information that will wind up on the
registration certificate.  They do NOT plan to examine the firearm, so
EVERY ERROR ON THE REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE IS YOUR ERROR, AND MAY RESULT IN A
FIREARMS ACT SECTION 106/109 CRIMINAL CHARGE AGAINST YOU when the firearm IS
examined -- as it will be, the next time it is transferred.

1.  It is dangerous (due to the possibility that they may prosecute you
under Firearms Act section 106 and 109) to give registration officials ANY
information that will appear on the registration certificate when you first-
register a rifle or shotgun, unless you are a WORLD-CLASS expert in firearms
AND know EXACTLY what ALL registration officicals WANT on the registration
certificate.  Any "error" of yours can result in charges the next time the
firearm is transferred.  It is a criminal offence under Firearms Act
sections 106(1) and (3) and 109 to make any "assertion of belief" while
applying for a registration certificate if that "assertion of belief" later
TURNS OUT to be "false or misleading" -- IN THE OPINION OF SOME LATER
OFFICIAL, WHEN YOU ARE TRANSFERRING THE FIREARM TO A NEW OWNER. This is a
VERY dangerous area for making ANY error -- not because charges are LIKELY,
but because abusive enforcement is VERY common and this is an easy area to
lay charges.  Even if found innocent, the charged person will be out
thousands of dollars in legal costs.

2.  Therefore, all future registrations of rifles and shotguns should
contain the MINIMUM possible information supplied by YOU, and should
include NO information where there might be ANY doubt or possibility of error.
The registration officials (presumably) know precisely what they want to call
your firearm -- so let THEM decide what entries should be put on your
registration certificate.

NOTE:  Regardless of what is stamped into the metal on a firearm, error is
likely. It may say "Browning" and "Ogden Utah and Montreal Canada" on it,
but what should the "Make" and "Manufacturer" entries be if it
was "Made in Japan" or "Made in Belgium" by some known or unknown factory?
THINK!  Are you CERTAIN that the calibre stamped on the barrel of your rifle is correct,
and that it was never re-chambered by a gunsmith?  That you are looking
at a Serial number, and not an assembly number, patent number, owner's number,
military number, or is therefore the WRONG number?   If in ANY doubt,
enter "UNKNOWN."  That entry can save you court costs -- and up to five years
imprisonment.

3.  Under the new registration system, they plan to add "enough extra
information to provide unique registration."  That "extra" information will,
in most cases, have to come from "spare part" components -- like the
Remington-Rand "spare-part" slide on my Colt .45, in which the "frame or
receiver" (the ONLY part that is, in and of itself, a "firearm" by
Criminal Code definition) was made by -- Colt!

4.  If "Remington Rand" appears on my registration certificate, then I
cannot change the slide without being required to re-register (by
notification, at the least) the "firearm."

5.  That, obviously, prevents easy interchange of "spare parts" when
modifying, customizing or repairing my "firearm."

NOTE: In rifles and shotguns, it can prevent rechambering, rebarrelling,
customization, changing a calibre, etc., etc. without re-registration or at
least formal notification that a change has been made.  Where they accept
formal notification instead of re-registration, YOU have no proof that you
complied with a requirement, and YOU CAN BE CHARGED FOR THEIR
ERRORS.  It is far better to PREVENT charges than to fight them.

6.  Therefore, in order to prevent the prevention of interchange, all future
registrations should be of firearms stripped to "frame or receiver" (with or
without small "unidentified" parts normally found IN a "frame or receiver").

7.  There is no requirement in law for you to have, or to supply to the
registration officials, any "spare parts" when registering such a "firearm,"
and no such addition to the law can be made by Order in Council.  An OIC
can only be made to explain or elaborate the law, NOT to EXTEND it.

8.  Once registered, even if they insist on annotating the registration
certificate "frame or receiver ONLY," it is REGISTERED and no charge of
improper registration can be brought in regard to that firearm.  The
legislation does NOT require that a "firearm" be complete, but DOES require
that the "firearm" be registered.  The "frame or receiver" IS that firearm"
-- regardless of what "spare parts" are assembed to it or removed from it.

NOTE: It may be impossible to denote on the registration certificate which
class of firearm it is, but that is only because the definition of
"firearm" and te definitions of "restricted firearm"
plus five differing definitions of prohibited firearm" are
in confused and confusing conflict with each other.

The requirement in law is to register a "firearm."  There is nothing to
require that the "firearm" be registered in a particular class, to require the
owner to modify it so that it falls into ONLY one class, or to purchase parts
that he does not currently own to satisfy the whims of a registration official
who wants it to fall into one -- and ONLY one -- class.  Under administratve
law, a registration official who makes such demands has strayed beyond
his legitimate role.  He is no longer exercising opinion judgement.  He is
LEGISLATING -- and that is clearly beyond his vested powers.

9.  Unfortunately, that type of registration will cause major "unique
identification" problems.  Since a "frame or receiver" HAS no Calibre, Shots
or Barrel length, those entries will have to be marked "UNKNOWN" on the
registration certificate.

10.  Additionally, there is serious danger in trying to supply PRECISELY
what the registration official WANTS for each entry on the registration
certificate for the "firearm" you are trying to register.  Therefore, to
avoid risk of prosecution at some later date, the only SAFE way to apply for
a registration certificate is to apply in this form: "Make: UNKNOWN; Model:
UNKNOWN; Manufacturer: UNKNOWN; Calibre: UNKNOWN; Shots: UNKNOWN; Barrel
length: UNKNOWN."  If YOU supply that information, and do not know that your
"J C Higgins" rifle was made by Marlin or that your Mauser rifle was made
by some company in Poland, that your Mauser 93 is actually a Mauser 95, or
that your ".30-06" has been rechambered to ".30-06 Ackley Improved" or ".308
Norma Magnum", or that your "10-shot" .22 rifle magazine will take 15
cartridges if they are .22 Short instead of .22 Long rifle, YOU can be held
to have given "false or misleading" information to get a registration
certificate.  If the registration official makes the selections, YOU cannot
be charged for HIS errors.

NOTE: Providing a Serial number on an application is also dangerous.  FRAS
currently has firearms registered with a Model number, a patent number, an
assembly number, a Serial number that appears only on a "spare part", etc.
If an applicant makes such an error, he violates FA s. 106(1) and (3), and is
liable to up to five years imprisonment [FA s. 109].  DO NOT ENTER!

11.  SUMMARY:  There are two problems:  (a) If you take in or describe the
whole firearm for registration, you run the risk of being unable to modify,
repair or customize it at some later date.  (b) If YOU tell them what
entries to put on the registration certificate, YOU can face criminal
charges at some later date when a registration official actually SEES the
firearm during transfer to someone else, and decides that YOU gave "false or
misleading" information to get your registration certificate.

NOTE:  ALWAYS keep your Application to Register -- to PROVE that YOU did
not have anything to do with registration certificate entries that turn out
to be wrong -- YEARS later.  That AtoR is YOUR INSURANCE.  KEEP IT!

12.  The cures for those problems are closely related.

(a) Registering ONLY the "frame or receiver" preserves your flexibility
when modifying, repairing or customizing in later years, and preserves
that flexibility for the NEXT owner.  In the future, a "flexibly-registered"
firearm will command a better price than a "rigidly-registered" one that
cannot be altered without excessive paper work.

(b)  ALWAYS leave it up to the registering officials to determine what
your firearm IS and what THEY want to call it on the registration
certificate.  Then YOU cannot be charged -- at some later date, by someone
who is not even HIRED yet -- with making an "assertion of belief" that
turned out to be "false or misleading" [FA s. 106(1) and (3), 109].

13.  Unfortunately, this pattern of registration conflicts with the intent
of the legislation to identify firearms by class (unrestricted firearm,
restricted firearm, and prohibited firearm [including 5 DIFFERENT and
mutually- exclusive subclasses of "prohibited firearm']).  That is NOT a
result of OUR activities -- it is a result of the defective definitions of
"firearm", "weapon", "restricted firearm" and "prohibited firearm" in the Act.

14.  Forcing the firearms control bureaucracy to provide the identification
of the firearm is going to be costly, at least $90 per firearm to be identified.
If all of the 20 million unrestricted rifles and shotguns are to be "identified"
by the firearms control bureaucracy, that comes to $1.8 BILLION.  Is C-68
cost-effective?  Keep asking that question, everyone.  Because it is not.

FOCUS:  This information is crucial to the future of the firearms community.
Give it the widest possible circulation, and explain it to everyone.  The
proposed methods of registration are illegal and abusive, so we must
comply with the law -- NOT the whim of some firearms control bureaucrat.
To obey the law CORRECTLY, it  is necessary to UNDERSTAND the law.

The Most Dangerous Item in C-68

Date: Fri, 28 Nov 1997 07:08:50 -0600
From: "David A. Tomlinson, NFA"
Subject: The Most Dangerous Item in C-68

C-68's version of the Criminal Code, section 117.15:

"117.15 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Governor in Council may make
regulations prescribing anything that by this Part is to be or may be
prescribed."

Translation:  The Minister of Justice, acting alone, with minimal oversight
by his fellow Cabinet members and without reference to Parliament, can make
Orders in Council with force of criminal law -- Orders in Council that
"prescribe" many, many things, and that become valid criminal law as they
come into force.  An Order in Council made under this authority does not
have to be "placed before each House of Parliament" for examination before
it comes into force.  Huge lawmaking power is taken away from Parliament by
this section, and given to a single Minister.

"117.15(2) In making regulations, the Governor in Council may not prescribe
any thing to be a prohibited firearm, a restricted firearm, a prohibited
weapon, a restricted weapon, a prohibited device, or prohibited ammunition
if, IN THE OPINION OF THE GOVERNOR IN COUNCIL, the thing to be prescribed is
reasonable for use in Canada for hunting or sporting purposes. [Emphasis
added -- DAT]"

Translation:  The key to understanding this paragraph lies in the words, "IN
THE OPINION OF THE GOVERNOR IN COUNCIL."  The House and Senate Committees
both recommended deleting those words before C-68 was passed, but our
Liberal government refused to delete them.

If they had been deleted, as recommended, then any attempt to outlaw, say,
all .22 biathlon rifles, muzzle-loading shotguns and/or .30-30 Winchester
hunting cartridges could be taken before a court, and the court could rule
that such things are "reasonable for use in Canada for hunting or sporting
purposes."  The Order in Council would then be voided by the court.  There
would have been access to justice, fairness and a thoughtful second look at
bad law.

Because they were NOT taken out, and are still there, no court can even look
at any such Order in Council -- because A COURT CANNOT SUBSTITUTE ITS OWN
OPINION FOR THE OPINION SPECIFIED IN THE LEGISLATION.  Those words, in that
place, mean that NO ONE's opinion is of any interest or has any power --
unless that person is the Minister of Justice (thinly disguised as the
"Governor in Council").  He is given the power of a dictator, not subject to
any review or to any second opinion, body or method that can be used to
override his "opinion."

By including those words, the Liberal Party government gave every Minister
of Justice -- NOT just today's, but every Minister of Justice who will ever
hold that position -- the power to outlaw every firearm, cartridge,
propellant, primer, reloading device, firearms accessory, spare part, etc.,
etc., in Canada.  It BLOCKED any appeal to the courts against ANYTHING that
the Minister may do in the future regarding Orders in Council outlawing
anything.

That is too much power to place in the hands of any one person.  It is far
too much power to place in the hands of EVERY person who will ever hold the
office of Minister of Justice.

FOCUS: Is THIS the type of government we want?  No?  Then get out there and
persuade as many voters as you can that they should help us throw the
Liberal Party onto the scrapheap of history -- beside its clone, the
Conservative Party.

YOUR RIGHT OF SELF-DEFENSE

"Citizens may resist UNLAWFUL arrest to the point of taking an arresting 
officer's life if necessary." PLUMMER V. STATE, 136 Ind. 306.  This 
premise was upheld by the SUPREME COURT of the United States in the 
case: JOHN BAD ELK V. U.S., 177 U.S. 529.  The Court stated: "Where 
the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which naturally 
accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law looks with
very different eyes upon the transaction, when the officer had the 
right to make the arrest, from what it does if the officer had no 
right.  What may be murder in the first case might be nothing more 
than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no 
offense had been committed."

"An arrest made with a defective warrant, or one issued without 
affidavit, or one that fails to allege a crime is within jurisdiction,
and one who is being arrested, may resist arrest and break away. lf the 
arresting officer is killed by one who is so resisting, the killing 
will be no more than an involuntary manslaughter." HOUSH V. PEOPLE, 
75 111. 491; reaffirmed and quoted in State v. Leach, 7 Conn. 452; 
State v. Gleason, 32 Kan. 245; Ballard v. State, 43 Ohio 349; 
State v Rousseau, 241 P. 2d 447; State v. Spaulding, 34 Minn. 3621.

"When a person, being without fault, is in a place where he has a right 
to be, is violently assaulted, he may, without retreating, repel by 
force, and if, in the reasonable exercise of his right of self defense,
his assailant is killed, he is justiciable." RUNYAN v. STATE, 57 Ind. 80;
Miller v. State, 74 Ind. 1. "These principles apply as well to an officer
attempting to make an arrest, who abuses his authority and transcends the
bounds thereof by the use of unnecessary force and violence, as they do 
to a private individual who unlawfully uses such force and violence." 
JONES v. STATE, 26 Tex.  App.  I; Beaverts v. State, 4 Tex.  App. 1 75;
Skidmore v. State, 43 Tex. 93, 903.

The following are some very interesting insights compiled in the 1940's (I
think), by Dr. Warren Carrol, a refugee from Yugoslavian Communism. These
observations are based Lenin's advacation of Socialism (please note, Communism
is EXACTLY the same when you wade through the B.S.).
 
FOURTEEN SIGNPOSTS TO SLAVERY (or Socialism)
 
1) Restrictions on taking money out of the country or retention of a foreign
bank account by an American citizen.
2) Abolition of privite ownership of guns.
3) Detention of individuals without judicial process.
4) Requirements that private financial transactions be keyed to social security
numbers or other identification so that government records of these
transactions can be kept by the Government.
5) Use of compulsory education laws to forbid attendance at presently existing
private schools.
6) Compulsory non-military service.
7) Compulsory psychological treatment for non-government workers or public
school children.
8) An official declaration that anti-Socialist,anti-Communist or anti-United
National organizations are subversive and subsequent legal action be taken to
suppress them.
9) Laws limiting the number of people allowed to meet in a private home.
10) Any significant change in passport regulations to make passports more
difficult to obtain or use.
11) Wage and price controls in a non-wartime situation.
12) Any kind of compulsory regulation with the government of where individuals
work.
13) Any attempt to restrict freedom of movement within the country.
14) Any attemt to make a new major law by executive decree (that is, actually
put into effect, not merely authorized as by existing executive orders).
 
This is a fairly old document, very seldom found in published form, written by
a very published historian (normally).
 
These steps to destroy personal freedom are not in order and don't seem to have
any particular importance, but this is whats required for a few select
individuals to make you and your friends their slaves.
 
There is very little you can do as an individual to prevent this from
happening. The only thing you can do is to capture this document and ensure as
many people as possible see it. It has nothing to do with "revolution" or
"overthrowing" the Government. It will remind people of what the "creators" of
our Constitution already knew (and found out the hard way!).
 
[Did you know...] "Assault Rifles" are not classified as automatic weapons.
These weapons are clasically used to shoot long distances, many rounds,
without the barrel warping. As a rule, these weapons are used in MILITARY
type confrontations only.

FWIW

The following excerpt is from an interview conducted by Aaron Zelman in
1990.  Mr. Zelman is the founder of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms
Ownership (JPFO / 2872 S. Wentworth Ave. / Milwaukee / WI / 53207 / 414-
769-0760).  His subject was Theodore Haas, a former prisoner of the
infamous Dachau concentration camp.

A Warning: HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR DENOUNCES ANTI-GUN-OWNERSHIP MOVEMENT
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

(Excerpt)
IF ONLY WE WERE ARMED
+++++++++++++++++++++

Q.  Did the camp inmates ever bring up the topic, "If only we were armed
    before, we would not be here now"?

A.  Many, many times.  Before Adolf Hitler came to power, there was a black
    market in firearms, but the German people had been so conditioned to be
    law abiding, that they would never consider buying an unregistered gun.
    The German people really believed that only hoodlums own such guns.
    What fools we were.  It truly frightens me to see how the government,
    media, and some police groups in America are pushing for the same mindset.
    In my opinion, the people of America had better start asking and demanding
    answers to some hard questions about firearms ownership, especially, if
    the government does not trust me to own firearms, why or how can the 
    people be expected to trust the government?

    There is no doubt in my mind that millions of lives could have been
    saved if the people were not "brainwashed" about gun ownership and had
    been well armed.  Hitler's thugs and goons were not very brave when
    confronted by a gun.  Gun haters always want to forget the Warsaw Ghetto
    uprising, which is a perfect example of how a ragtag, half-starved group
    of Jews took up 10 handguns and made asses out of the Nazis.

Q.  Did you have any contacts with the White Rose Society (mostly German
    students against Hitler)?  Did anyone try to hide you from the Nazis?

A.  I did not, but my local friend, Richard Scholl, had two cousins or nephews
    who were members.  Both were executed in Munich (I believe) for standing
    up for decency and freedom.  Not enough people knew about the White Rose
    Society.  There were many non-Jews who were not anti-Semetic and were
    very much opposed to Hitler.

    It was impossible to hide people from the Nazis in Germany - it is so 
    densely populated and food was rationed.  Another point that many people
    fail to understand is that in Germany, you had a situation where the
    children were reporting to their teachers if their parents listened to
    the BBC on the short wave radio, or what they were talking about at home.
    If a German was friendly to a Jew, he was warned once.  If he failed to
    heed the warning, he would disappear and never be heard from again.  This
    was known as "Operation Night and Fog."

Q.  Do you think American society has enough stability that Jews and other
    minorities are safe from severe persecution?

A.  No.  I think there is more anti-Semitism in America (some of it caused
    by leftist Jewish politicians and organizations who promote gun control
    schemes) than there was in Germany.  This may stun some people, but not
    all Germans hated Jews.  My best and devoted friends in Germany were
    Christians.

    I perceive America as a very unstable society, due to the social tinkering
    of the Kennedy/Metzenbaum-type politicians.  When I first came to this
    wonderful country after World War II, America was a vibrant, dynamic and
    promising society.  There really was an American dream, attainable by 
    those who wanted to work.  Now, due to the curse of Liberalism, America
    is in a period of moral decline.  Even worse, corrupt criminals hold
    high political office, and you have police officials who don't give a
    damn about the Bill of Rights.  They just want to control people, not
    protect and serve.  When you study history, you see that when a country
    becomes an immoral manure heap, as America is rapidly becoming, all
    minorities suffer, and ultimately, all the citizens.

Q.  What words of warning would you like to give to young people who will
    soon be eligible to vote?

A.  Vote only for politicians who trust the people to own all types of
    firearms, and who have a strong pro-Second Amendment voting record.
    Anti-gun-ownership politicians are very dangerous to a free society.
    Liberty and freedom can only be preserved by an armed citizenry.  I
    see creeping fascism in America, just as in Germany, a drip at a time;
    a law here, a law there, all supposedly passed to protect the public.
    Soon you have total enslavement.  Too many Americans have forgotten
    that tyranny often masquerades as doing good.  This IS the technique
    the Liberal politicians/Liberal media alliance are using to enslave
    America.

Q.  What message do you have for ultra-Liberal organizations and individuals
    who want Americans disarmed?

A.  Their ignorance is pitiful - their lives have been too easy.  Had they
    experienced Dachau, they would have a better idea of how precious freedom
    is.  These leftists should live in the tradition of America or they should
    leave America.  These Sarah Brady types must be educated to understand
    that because we have an armed citizenry, that a dictatorship has not YET
    happened in America.  These anti-gun fools are more dangerous to Liberty
    than street criminals or foreign spies.

Q.  Some concentration camp survivors are opposed to gun ownership.
    What message would you like to share with them?

A.  I would like to say, "You cowards; you gun haters, you don't deserve to
    live in America.  Go live in the Soviet Union, if you love gun control
    so damn much."  It was the stupidity of these naive fools that aided
    and abetted Hitler's goons and thugs.  Anti-gun-ownership Holocaust
    survivors insult the memories of all those that needlessly perished for
    lack of being able to adequately defend themselves.

Q.  It appears the Liberal left in America is tolerating, and sometimes
    espousing anti-Semitism.  Why do you think so many Jews still support
    the leftist form of Liberalism?

A.  It is for this very reason that I firmly believe that we harbor more
    stupid and naive people in our midst, than any other group of people.
    It amazes me how Liberal Jews have such short memories that today,
    they would be so supportive and involved in setting up the mechanics
    of gun control, so that a Holocaust can happen again.  All they're doing
    is playing into the hands of the very clever communists who are masters
    at conning Americans.

Q.  Why did you join JPFO?

A.  I feel every Jew should be armed to the teeth, as should every American.
    I joined JPFO because as a group, we can stand up to Liberal Jewish gun
    haters and also to Gestapo-minded anti-gun police who want total control
    of the people.  I wish JPFO was in existence years ago.  I believe the
    Jewish involvement in gun cintrol would not be anywhere close to what
    it is today, but better now than never.

THC PHREAK'S TOP TEN LIST -                                       {TOP TEN}
Self-Defense Weapons.

        1.  Guns - Revolvers are too heavy, bulky and difficult to conceal.
            9mm pistols (Glock, Berretta, Smith & Wesson, Browning) are much
            better.  Use the largest capacity clip that you can get and have
            extra clips for your weapon.  Use soft point or hollow point ammo.
            It has more stopping power to disable the attacker in a hurry and
            the bullet won't travel right through their body, possibly injuring
            innocent people.  Carry your weapon with you in your car so that
            you don't get car-jacked.  Or, you can holster your sidearm and
            have it at the ready at all times.  It's also a good idea to keep
            a handgun in your house, with a trigger lock installed or in a
            safe.  The safes that can be opened in the dark (button operated)
            are best, since they give you accessibility in an emergency like
            a break-in.  The other option is to have a shotgun for home
            protection.  A 12 gauge will suffice, unless you're under attack
            by the military, terrorists, the SWAT team, a gang or a group of
            heavily armed rogue cops.  Then you'll require an assault rifle
            and a large supply of ammo.  ;)

        2.  Knives - Carrying a small, concealed knife on your person for
            personal protection is always a good idea.  Don't go overboard
            and try to walk around with a machete.  ;)  Also, switch blades
            and butterfly knives aren't the best to use.  Get a knife (such
            as a buck knife) with a folding handle.  It should be 5-6" in
            length and have a sturdy blade that won't break easily if used.
            Don't buy a cheap knife.  Your life could depend on it.

        3.  Stun Guns - They aren't as easy to conceal as knives, but they
            are an effective weapon.  They can disable an attacker in seconds,
            without drawing blood.  Buy the most powerful one that you can.
            Some of them have 100,000 volts of stunning power.  Also, the
            better ones can be used as a hand held stun gun and a tazer that
            fires up to 10 feet away.  If you can find the dual purpose gun
            somewhere, they are the best.

        4.  Pepper Spray - A canister can be carried and concealed.  It's
            an effective weapon, that when sprayed in someone's eyes or
            mouth will blind them, cause pain and difficulty breathing etc.
            It is also fairly inexpensive and can be purchased in the U.S.

        5.  Mase - It's not as effective as pepper spray, but it has similar
            results when used.  It's not just for women that are afraid of
            being assaulted.  It is an alternative to guns and knives.

        6.  Brass Knuckles - They can be carried in your pocket, taken anywhere
            and can do quite a bit of damage.  Brass knuckles are good for
            situations in which you don't want to pull a knife or draw a gun,
            such as open/public places like bars, etc.  While wearing a pair
            of brass knuckles, you can at least stand a chance against a gang
            of people.  If you're completely outnumbered, then it isn't a
            good equalizer.  But, if you drop one of them with one punch, the
            rest might decide to leave you alone.

        7.  Night Sticks - They are also called Billy Sticks, Clubs, Sticks etc.
            Cops and Prison Guards use night sticks.  You can buy them or steal
            one from them.  They're available in wood (oak), hard plastic,
            graphite etc.  Night Sticks are good to have under the front seat
            of cars and can also be carried under a coat.  However, you have
            to practice using them and become skilled with this weapon.
            Otherwise, it can be taken from you and used against you.

        8.  NunChucks - You can make your own by attaching a chain to two
            equal length dowels of hardwood.  The ends should fit into your
            hand and be comfortable.  The diameter of each end shouldn't be
            too large to grasp.  Or, you can just buy a pair.  This weapon
            requires a lot of practice to become skilled at using.  It's not
            easily concealed either.

        9.  Key Chains - You can purchase key chains that have a small iron
            bar attached.  These little devices are weapons that can be
            carried anywhere without anyone ever noticing what it is.  To use
            them, you hit the attacker in the throat, eye or on the side of
            their head (preferably the temple) with the tip of it.  Since the
            force is concentrated in a small area and it's a hard object, an
            amazing amount of damage can be done by it.  However, it relies
            on a perfect swing and punch to be effective.

        10. Bars - A small steel bar that can be carried in your pocket, fits
            in your hand (while making a fist) can deliver an added kick to
            a punch.  You can also use a roll of quarters, that's been taped
            shut with masking tape.  If you're able to hit the assailant on
            the jaw with enough force, then they can be knocked out with a
            single punch.

Note:  I don't advocate the use of weapons in fights.  Weapons and force should
only be used when necessary.  Don't use them unless you're in danger of being
injured and need to defend yourself.  If you own a gun, be careful and take
precautions to make sure that it's not taken and used against you or someone
else.  Remember, guns don't kill... people do.  Also, don't bring guns to school
because that ain't c00l kidz.  :)

THOUGHTS, POEMS AND CREATIVE WRITING -                            {WRITING}
"A pathetic zombie race."

Blood dripping from the sky.
Over and over you hear the hideous cries.
Desperation.

Covering the ground are bodies in tatters.
Their dreams have been shattered.
Disposable heroes.

In battle they fought for social evolution.
There wasn't a conclusion or resolution.
No revolution.

Brave souls with a cause were attacked and decimated.
Their very existence was removed, destroyed and eliminated.
Chaotic evil.

Big Brother's mind control and ignorant teachings were victorious.
Disinformation, propaganda and lies.  For that they are notorious.
Weapons of mass destruction.

The men did not seek any followers or pity.
Big Brother was their foe.  An enemy that defines and lives for infamy.
Dissidents.

Glory, honor and truth were what they respected.
Those very things were what the vast majority utterly rejected.
Zombies.

Indifference and ignorance ruled.
Again and again the zombies were fooled.
Blindness.

Their will and independence crushed.
Now Big Brother is all that the zombies trust.
Overpowered.

Individuality and freedom were lost.
Now they were mere puppets...controlled and brainwashed.
No resistance.

Their rights, choices and chances were now gone.
Afterall, they chose not to fight and Big Brother had won.
Defeated.

They ignored the warnings.  They refused to wage war.
Indeed, the zombies supported and believed Big Brother.  Whenever they were
stripped, raped and beaten they went back and asked for more.
Naive.

Influenced and constantly being manipulated by Big Brother.
Truth and lies were now the same.  They couldn't tell one from another.
Puppets.

Yes, the gullible zombies were influenced by all of the false promises.  They
believed the shit and did what they were told.
In the end, they weren't human beings.  Their strings could be pulled at will
by Big Brother and they were frequently imprisoned, bought and sold.
Enslaved.

Life in captivity is what they chose.
Slavery under Big Brother is something they simply could not oppose.
Weak.

Was this way of life torture to them?  Were the zombies upset or enraged?
No, it was Utopia.  They actually believed they were living in a gilded cage.
Controlled.

The land wasn't theirs to own.  The decisions weren't theirs to make.
But Big Brother repeatedly assured them that his way was best.  He decided
everything for them, for their own sake.
Brainwashed.

However, the zombies were all satisfied with the way things were.  They
were peaceful and content.
Was their happiness real?  Or was it artificial... twisted and bent?
Fake.

To them though, it was real.  For they acted on emotion and rejected all logic.
They were disillusioned fools.  They just couldn't see that it was wrong,
demented and sick.
Deceived.

Arm themselves?  Pointless.  Fight back?  Unacceptable and dangerous.
Relinquish civil rights and liberties?  Fair.  Victimized and controlled?
Socially acceptable and part of going with the flow.
Conformity.

Their silence was deafening and deadly.
It killed any chance of reform, quickly and effectively.
Self-Sabotage.

The zombies loved ignorance and always strived to be perfect, willing victims.
Never speak out.  Never oppose.  Never question.  Always support the system.
Mindless.

They gave in and had betrayed the very people that were fighting for them.
The zombies were alone.  On their behalf, there was nobody left to fend.
Helpless.

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Deadly Closing Comments:

This marks the end of our 'one year anniversary edition/issue' of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  To say the least, it's been a unique experience.
However, it has also been an enjoyable one.  Over the last year, we've
undergone many changes.  By looking back at the first issue, I can definitely
notice the progress that we've made.  Also, the group itself has changed in
the last twelve months.  I believe the changes made have been for the benefit
of the group and the readers of our releases.  I can honestly say that the
whole experience has humbled me.  Although, it hasn't slowed me down, tamed me
or dulled the sharp edges in my character that I cherish.  I still possess
the same desire to move forward, continue to share information and my thoughts
with others.  That's something that I don't think will ever change.  My quest
to educate and inform is neverending.  Even though the goals and direction of
Damage, INC. are constantly evolving and progressing, I don't think that my
own state of mind has been drastically altered or affected... Sure, my writing
has improved somewhat and my 'message' is being sent out across the vast
expanse of this wired world now.  But my reasons for writing articles haven't
changed, nor have my opinions, beliefs and views.  I feel that it's important
to maintain and reaffirm those things... At the same time, I try to allow room
for growth and change.  A person's mind should never be idle.  It's what I
like to refer to as "Personal Evolution."  You can change without compromising
the beliefs that you hold strongly.  It's not easy, but it can be done.

As for this issue, it's one of the best that we've released in my opinion.  It
is very theme oriented and contains many thought provoking, interesting and
informative articles.  In fact, it's the type of issue that I wanted to strive
for since the very beginning.  No previous issues of the Damage, INC. Newsletter
were even close to this issue in relation to establishing and developing a
particular theme.  In this issue, the theme is evident and strong throughout.
I'm not sure that we can duplicate the level that's been achieved again in
future issues.  However, we'll make an honest attempt.  ;)  The only real
disappointment is the lack of letters and articles submitted by readers that
continues to exist.  We'd like our avid readers to participate more in the
process, ask questions, make comments etc.  In other words, don't remain
silent when you have something to say.  Voice your opinions, let us know what
you think about certain articles and make a contribution if possible.  We're
not asking/looking for compliments.  We just want to know what you think.
Always remember that not standing up or speaking out is a dangerous thing that
can eventually come back to haunt you.  You're already armed with a voice, so
all you have to do is be willing to use it.

Then again, as I said to a 519 user on a board, I don't care if you read
it or wipe your ass with it.  He then asked how he could do that.  So, I
told him that he had two options.  Print it out first, or put his ass up
against his monitor's screen.  I have no idea if he chose to wipe his ass
with it by using the latter method.  However, if he did, then his monitor
must look and smell very strange now.  ;)  Here it is point blank, if you
don't like something, then don't read it.  At any rate, the above quotes
should be enough critical acclaim to last for another year.
