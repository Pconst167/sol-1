Eyes of Aquila.

Arctic air being blasted downward by strong northern winds as a cold front
moves in.  Yet you're still warm.  You're still who you are... who you've
always been.  Still someone with a heart I admire... and want to imagine.

Warming...

With eagle eyes you watch from above... observing the situation... studying...
analyzing and disseminating information.  Your eyes and mind dissecting anything
and everyone.  With eyes of wonder like the Argus, watchful and noticing.  Yet
you are calm and easy... and your eyes are not menacing.  Ever so pleasant to
imagine... with such beautiful imagery in my mind... dancing.

Imagining...

Soothing eyes and gentle words with a calming effect that are melodic in tone.
Poetic without effort, even over the incessant noise and the room's constant
drone.  Always so insightful, with wisdom that forces me to think.  Always
compassionate, never allowing me to fade... never allowing my spirit to sink.
From the crevasses of your mind, I could drink.

Soothing...

My thirst is quenched and you feed me thoughts to contemplate.  You are well
worth the price of admission, to get to know... trust and wait for fears to
abate.  You've softened me without harming or weakening.  Knowing that, I look
forward to all the future encounters we may have... and what they might possibly
bring.  In Winter's darkness and discontent you are my Spring.

Softening...

A gentle soul that can see right through me, leaving me vulnerable... but not
alone.  All of the advice you've given me, all of the pieces, layers and levels
of yourself you've shown.  I'm thankful... grateful beyond measure.  Just
reading your thoughts... gives me such great pleasure.  Your very existence is
something I truly treasure.

Opening...

All that I know of you can't be put into words, and yet I still know there's so
much more.  So intricate, complex... so deep... you'd take a thousand years to
explore.  With words that sustain and satisfy me... knowledge and interest of
things that never cease to amaze... you're more than these eyes can see.
Without judging, your eyes once more cast their hypnotic gaze.  And once more
we meet and converse in this strange, electronic place.

Deepening...

- Dedicated to Aquila.  You are all those things, and more.  You're also a
true friend that I trust and care deeply about.  I can no longer imagine not
having your friendship, since I value it so very much.  I treasure your
existence immensely.  Thank you for the encouragement, advice, inspiration and
all of the other things you've done for me.  ;)
