{BIG BROTHER} BASHING -
Government Control and Corruption in our Society:

    If you have read the book 1984 by George Orwell, you will immediately
recognize the phrase "Big Brother."  You have to ask yourself then, how far
is our current society from that state?  I asked myself this exact question,
and my answer?  Not that far, if we continue on the way things are going.
    Canada is not as bad as the United States, but calling us "the 53rd
state" is a pretty close comparison.  And I must say, things have improved
in the 1990's.  Equal rights are an important social advancement, and I am
glad to see a step in the right direction.  All praise aside, I think its
time to expose what's really going on...
    Supposedly we live in a "Democracy".
    HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.
    I need convincing.  Let's face it, "by the people, of the people, for the
people" is a crock 'a' shit.  Government looks out for government first, then
the good of society.  Ever heard of Watergate?  It's just the biggest
government coverup in the twentieth century.  Ever wonder about the Vietnam
War?  Now why exactly did Washington send thousands of soldiers to kill
millions of citizens?  We can never know.  Let me tell you about the Black
Panthers  -  A radical negro rights group in the 1960's.  The Local law
enforcement gave them so much trouble, they eventually fell apart.  Despite
the fact that they broke no laws, hurt nobody, just wanted to be treated
the same.  And just how did "the man" control these outbreaks?  They flooded
the Ghetto with extremely pure, "china-white" heroine, at dirt-cheap prices.
If you want proof, watch the news, any channel, at 6:00pm.  Murder rate up
7% since last year.  "Just another homicide".  It's no bullshit, the ghetto
warzone was created by none-other than your local government.
    And then of course, there's the CiA LSD experiments in the 1960's.
Making subjects stay up for 40 days at a time, tripped out 24/7.  Asking
themselves, "so, I wonder how much Acid this guy can take before he goes
clinically insane."  Nobody knew about these experiments though.  The
families were bought out, or threatened; the subjects themselves were all
eventually admitted to mental institutions.  It's scary.
    And these are just ones I'm thinking of off the top of my head.  There
are many more documented in books and film.  Mel Gibson's latest flick
"Conspiracy Theory" is Hollywood's way of showing the Film-going public what
really goes on behind closed doors.  Blackened talks about Government
coverup in war-time situations in this issue.
    This is a taste of the current political situation.  In every aspect,
Politics has some underhanded connection in it.  Whether it's kickbacks
to the Mafia, or deals made with Hells Angels.  From the health-inspector
who takes bribes, to the Tax Auditor who embezzles funds, the fabric of our
Government is woven with Fraud.  Corruption is so heavily entrenched in
the current political system, I believe things will not get better if we
don't do something about it.  The outcome if we don't???
    Collapse.
Total and utter, political, economic, social collapse.  But that is at the
end.  Because If we let things continue the way they are, you will be
praying at night for the collapse.  The end.  Please God end this Hell.
That will be your prayer.  And they'll hear it.  Because "they'll" have
technology that can hear everything.  One for each block.  They'll justify
it by claiming it reduces crime, being able to listen in on anybody, at
any time.  I heard the other day that private companies d/l all newsgroup
and public messages from the internet, and log them.  They keep massive
storage/retrieval systems on every word that get's published on the news
groups.  How much do you want to bet that CIA or FBI search those databases
for "suspicious" discussion?  We'll never know.
    This newsletter is intended to open your eyes.  This article was written
in the hopes that you will not believe everything "your government" tells
you.  The way I see it, it's US against THEM.

CONSPIRACIES AND {COVERUPS} -
THE GULF WAR SYNDROME COVERUP...EXPOSED:

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Defense (DOD) and top
brass of the American Military are all involved in an immense coverup.  That
includes the former President of the United States, George Bush.  He was the
Commander in Chief at the time of the Gulf War.  Bush also happens to be an
ex-CIA director.  Former military leaders such as Colin Powell, Norman
Schwartzkopf and possibly others were involved in the massive coverup as well.
President Clinton has formed a committee that's supposed to investigate the
"Gulf War Illness" but nothing productive will result from it.  The proof is
that one member has already been removed for trying to get CIA and DOD top
secret documents de-classified to show that troops were exposed to chemical and
biological weapons.  Therefore, Bill Clinton is also part of the coverup since
he has said and done nothing but setup a fixed commission.  Clinton knows the
truth but he isn't going to reveal it.

According to an ex-CIA member, the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by chemical
and biological weapons that American and other coalition troops were exposed
to during the war.  By his latest estimates, over 100,000 U.S. troops alone
were affected and are still suffering.  The CIA promptly fired him and tried
to silence him by giving out his name, address, unlisted phone numbers and
social security number.

Saddam Hussein *did* unleash powerful chemical and biological weapons.  In
fact, some of the "harmless and inaccurate" SCUD missiles were armed with
them.  During some of the SCUD attacks, major damage was done and wasn't
reported.  As in, yellow rain (first used in Vietnam and Afghanistan by Russia)
burned the skin of troops after a SCUD exploded near their location.  Many
areas were targets of these deadly, poisonous attacks.  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and certain areas of Iraq are all known to be places where troops saw and
experienced strange things.  For example, they were instructed to destroy
thousands of bombs that were seized.  Unfortunately, they weren't told to wear
protective gas masks and clothing.  They weren't warned of the dangers involved
with destroying those types of weapons.  Actually, they were told nothing but
just expected to perform the duty and serve their country.  Meanwhile, there
were disposal trenches and vehicles outside the buildings that were marked
Biological Hazard etc.  Safe methods weren't used to dispose of the chemical
and biological weapons though.  That's the reason why thousands of soldiers
are sick today, years after the conflict ended.

The CIA's involvement is vast.  They were directly involved and worked closely
with the Department of Defense (DOD) to coverup the evidence and deny the fact
that troops were exposed to any chemical or biological weapons.  They even
denied knowing anything about the situation.  They claimed to have absolutely
no knowledge about those weapons being used in the Gulf War.  Meanwhile, they
have documents that contradict their own statements.  The CIA is a corrupt
organization that is built upon lies and coverups.  That's how they've done
business throughout their entire history.  Basically, the CIA is more concerned
with their own interests than that of the people they are supposed to protect.
They made deals with the Department of Defense.  Meanwhile, that is a conflict
of interest.  The CIA should be keeping track of what the DOD does, instead of
covering their negligent asses for them!

Troops from many nations are still suffering from the Gulf War Syndrome.  Many
ground soldiers from the United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia and other
countries have shown the same symptoms as American troops.  They're being told
by doctors at Veteran's hospitals that it is all in their heads.  It is now
September 1997 and still nobody will admit the truth about what actually
occurred during the Gulf War.  In order to cure the disease and illnesses caused
by biological weapons, you must first know what troops were affected, where they
were on duty, what weapons were involved in the attack or during the destruction
process etc.  Until that happens, soldiers that served their countries in the
Gulf War will continue to suffer the severe lifelong consequences.  Personally,
I find it to be a sickening example of the extent that governments will go to
coverup documented events.  It's a real tragedy that has continued long after
the actual battle has ceased.  That's the real legacy of the Gulf War.  So,
before you think about the victory and laugh at the defeat of Iraq and Hussein,
consider for a moment the conspiracy and great coverup in the aftermath.

CORRUPTION AND {GREED} -
BURGER KING AND HUDSON FOODS...A LETHAL COMBINATION:

Burger King's main supplier was Hudson Foods (a huge American meat company that
recently recalled millions of pounds of beef).  Last week, Hudson Foods sold
their Columbus, Nebraska plant to Tyson Foods.  The processing plant was the
main beef division for Hudson Foods.  Recently, NBC's Dateline reported on
the situation.  They spoke with former Hudson employees, and were told several
shocking stories describing the types of activities that went on at the plant.
USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) inspection tags that pointed out problems
with meat were *removed*, which is a criminal offence.  Ground beef that fell
onto the floor was used in the making of hamburger patties.  "Keep production
going!" was their only slogan.  Greed and profit drove Hudson Foods to put
the health of every customer at risk.  They were so corrupt, the management
forced employees to change reports that they'd written.  In case you aren't
aware, meat has to be transported, stored and shipped out after processing at
a low temperature to prevent bacteria from growing.  Well, Hudson Foods would
not allow employees to record temperatures that were too high.  Normally, meat
should be kept at 34 degrees or lower.  Meanwhile, meat at Hudson Foods was
consistently above that...sometimes 44 degrees or even warmer.  So, they'd tell
the employees to probe for a cold spot.  If that failed, they'd do anything to
influence them into writing down a lower temperature.  That can have deadly
consequences.  Former Hudson employees also reported that it was almost
impossible to keep up with the demand from customers, mainly Burger King.

This week, Burger King introduced a new hamburger called the "Big King" in an
attempt to compete with McDonald's Big Mac.  Who is their new supplier?  How
are they going to be able to supply even more hamburgers to Burger King?  Can
we trust the food that we pay for and consume?  As customers of fast food
chains, should we question whether or not the food is tainted and contaminated?
Is there any type of protection in place to safeguard consumers?  Have you ever
heard the term E. Coli used before?  If not, continue to read this article and
Damage, INC. will educate you by giving you the cold, harsh facts.

FOOD RADIATION:

After Hudson Foods tainted beef scandal has been exposed, there is a renewed
interest in food radiation.  When food is irradiated, supposedly any E. Coli,
Salmonella and other micro-organisms in the food product are killed.  Instead
of using good meat handling practices, the quick and easy way out is food
radiation.  The term "radiation" conjures up all kinds of images.  To readers
that haven't heard of E. Coli, it's a lethal form of bacteria that is common in
animal and human waste.

According to a scientist interviewed on CBC Radio, food has been irradiated
for over 40 years, and is a common practice in 40 countries.  The scientist
also claimed that the United States and Canada use the technology in a limited
capacity.  They supposedly only irradiate imports from other countries like
tropical fruits, spices, etc.  I seriously doubt that.  I believe they also
irradiate domestic foods in Canada and I'll stand by those words.

The World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association have
already endorsed the practice of food radiation.  However, the DOA (Department
of Agriculture and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) are stalling because of
what is viewed as "the public's notion that radiation is harmful... that they
are fearful of the word radiation."  The FDA commented that the practice would
be unacceptable to consumers because of their fear.  Why should we trust them?
Do you want to ingest food that's been radiated?  I definitely don't.  During
the 1950s atomic bomb tests, scientists claimed radiation levels were safe
enough for American troops to be directly exposed to at close range.  Should
we now believe that food radiation is completely safe?  Haha!  Radiation can be
a deadly weapon.  Don't be naive.  Don't allow them to brainwash you by saying
that it isn't harmful.  How could radiation be good for you?  What's next?
Perhaps they'll want to add poison to our food supply in order to kill other
forms of bacteria.

The main purpose of the technology is to kill any molds and funguses that
are in the food product.  (Should moldy meat be used in the first place?)
Setting up the technology is expensive, but the scientist claimed that most of
the big meat packers could easily afford it.  Hudson Foods could've easily
afforded it, since they would bus in homeless drug addicts from New York City
and Mexican immigrants to work at their meat processing plant.  Now that's what
I call a cheap labour force.  Can employees such as that be trusted to handle
food properly?  I think not.  They didn't even test meat in the plant's lab.
They used the excuse of being too overloaded with orders from Burger King.  At
any rate, food radiation shouldn't be the solution.  It's all about greed and
making huge profits.  Food safety is the last priority and totally ignored.

The food radiation process is as follows:

First, the meat is examined with all of the current methods.  Second, the
meat is cleaned, and processed (cut into retail cuts of meat, packaged,
etc.).  Then they are dropped onto a conveyor belt and sent to a "shielded"
part of the plant.  The food is then exposed to intense gamma rays.  That is
correct, gamma rays.  The same gamma rays that turned the Incredible Hulk
green!  The process takes time, so the meat is exposed more than just a few
seconds.  The gamma radiation supposedly breaks down the DNA of the offending
micro-organism, rendering it unable to reproduce.  When the life cycle of
the existing micro-organism has ended, the scientist said that the offending
organism (like E. Coli) is gone, unless the meat is put into conditions where
the micro-organism thrives.  In other words, the meat can still become tainted
if it's improperly handled and stored at the wrong temperature.  What happens
if it's exposed to gamma rays for an extended duration?  The workers are bound
to make mistakes and errors always happen eventually.

NBC and CNN interviewed farmers that supplied Hudson Foods with beef.  They
admitted on television that they feed their cattle chicken shit, sawdust,
dead dogs, cats and wild animals (roadkill) that they find on the side of the
road near their farms.  Basically, their feed consists of *anything* except
grain.  Burger King has yet to disclose the name of their new meat supplier.
I wonder why?  Yet, they've started an advertising blitz for the "Big King"
burger to divert the media attention away.  It's business as usual for that
fat cat corporation.  As the saying goes, shit in and shit out.  If you feed
the cattle chicken shit, what do you think the burgers are going to contain?
Their famous Whopper should really be called a Plopper.  Haha.  If you want to
eat shit and die, have it your way right away at "Burger" King.  The next time
you're at Shit King... standing at the counter and ready to order...do yourself
a big favour and think about this article.  ;)  As a consumer, you have to be
responsible for your own health and protection.  Don't believe, trust and rely
on the government or any fat cat companies.  They're greedy, corrupt and don't
care how many people become sick and die from E. Coli etc.

H/P INFORMATION AND {NEWS} -
Motivational Neophyte Blurb...

    So obviously you're reading this because you want something more out of
the (519) BBS scene.  Warez just don't do it for you.  Play one game, you've
played them all right?.  Plus, you can't really put "I played a lot of pirated
video games" on your resume now can you?.
    My name is The Journalist.  I have been BBS'ing for over 4 years.  Not
that long, but longer than most.  I have watched the quality of users and
BBS's deteriorate like a snowman on a sunny day.  I'm not saying things are
lame now.  Far from it.  There just seems to be a major lack of leaders.
You know, people like me :)  People who go out of their way to make BBS-Land
a better place.  Now, what I'm saying here is, things are gonna change
around here.  Not because I say so, but because *you* want them to.  C'mon,
can you say that you have experienced the thrill of beige boxing?  The
satisfaction of breaking a password?  These things are still entirely
possible.  One comment I hear all too often is "... but all those text files
are written for like 20 years ago."  BULLSHIT!  It's just a little harder
because now you have to sift through the shit to get the good stuff.  I'll
tell you now, most boxes don't work, because The phone company got wise and
made it harder to get free calls.  But that doesn't mean shit.  Go to a bell
office, and do some trashing.  You might find some interesting stuff,
you might not.  But it was fun right?
    One point I want to get across is that the h/p scene has evolved.
Not anymore is it just about getting an extender or hacking a system.
It's about being on the frontier of the information age.
Think about that.
The *information* age.  We are living one of the biggest revolutions of our
time.  The Internet?  Think about what you imagine the internet will be
in 10 years?  Think about how in history class, one of the projects will be
"the history of the internet"  We are living it baby, and once you realize
this, you understand the importance of preserving free speech, and
condemning censorship.  (all you internet-porn-kings! :))
    The conclusion is this... Welcome to the future of H/P/A/C/V 

(c)1997 written by The Journalist 04/09/97

It's 11 o'clock... Do you know where your hard drive is?  ;)  This is the
local h/p news section.  The state of the group ati (access to information)
is now in question.  The ati web page lasted mere weeks and is no longer up.
The Crypt (ati's whq) wasn't online for the entire summer and ati_net was
basically dead.  Not only that, tck disappeared into the abyss and wasn't seen
on any local h/p boards...until recently when he resurfaced.  This commentary
isn't meant to bash ati.  I'm just reporting the news as it exists and stating
the facts.  The main point is that ati is inactive and hasn't released anything
since May 1997.  Is it the beginning and the end for ati?  Will tck resurrect
the group?  I'm not going to draw any conclusions.  We'll just have to wait and
see what develops.


{INTERVIEWS} AND INTERROGATIONS -
A SPECIAL INTERVIEW WITH THE JOURNALIST:

The following text is a recent interview that BLACKENED conducted on FoI with
the newest member of Damage, INC.

-B is BLACKENED
-TJ is The Journalist

Introduce yourself to the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  -B

If you don't know me already, I run a h/p support board in (519).  I have
been in the bbs scene for a long time, and many will know me as a creative    
and innovative thinker :)  -TJ

What made you become interested in the whole h/p scene?  -B

Hmm... that's a good question Blackened.  I would have to say it started a    
few years back when I came across some txt files on The Digital Network.  I   
had a 2400 at the time, and Text files were easy to get.  I started reading   
about hacking, and more of the anarchy, (ripping off pop machines and the     
like :)) Basically it snowballed from there.  I found other h/p boards in the 
area, and started calling LD to &TOTSE and other famous sites.  The rest as   
they say is history.  -TJ

;)  After that, why did you decide to start FoI and run your own board?  -B

Well I think a small history is needed here, because I decided to run a board 
pretty soon after I started bbs'ing.  I started as  a PD board.  And          
progressed to Warez (under the bbs ICE COLD :)) When I realized how pointless 
warez were, I decided to convert over to h/p, which has been one of the best
decisions I ever made.  h/p has always had a small following, and I guess I   
hoped that running FoI would attract otherwise warez geeks to a more          
fulfilling interest.  -TJ

How long has FoI been online and supporting h/p now?  -B

I would have to say about 18 months give or take 5 years :) hehe no,
probably 18 months to 2 years.  -TJ

That's cool.  Would you describe FoI as being more h/p related or general     
information and ideas?  -B

umm.. let me think about that one.  For those who have bravely ventured thru  
the file bases of FoI, I'm sure you'll note the diversity of files online.    
I like to have h/p as the focus, but let's face it, sometimes you just want   
to read about something other than hacking UNIX or such.  FoI is based on     
Information - regardless of topic.  -TJ

For those that haven't called FoI that might be reading this newsletter, what 
reason would you give for them to call your board?  -B

hehee :) a sales ad eh? No, FoI is different.  If you are sick of warez, or   
sick of certain people in the warez scene, you should call FoI.  If you are   
haunted by the corruption in our current political system, you should call    
FoI.  If you like the idea of taking advantage of the big corporations (Bell, 
etc) you should call FoI.  There is something for everyone at FoI.  Except    
maybe the pups.  -TJ

Now that you've discussed FoI a little and described it to our readers, I'd   
like to ask you what difference you think being a Damage, INC. Member and FoI
being the new Damage, INC. Dist. Site will make (to yourself, FoI and 519)?  -B

I expect Damage, INC. will boost user interest in FoI.  For myself, Damage,   
INC. represents an organization where the member's interests are the same as  
my own.  It is very rewarding.  I know I will learn new things by being a     
part of Damage, INC.  And I know for a fact that an FoI/Damage, INC.          
Combination will have a strong, positive effect on the diminishing (519)      
scene.  -TJ

How do you think the Damage, INC. Newsletter and interviews such as this one  
will affect the local h/p scene?  -B

By providing local, up-to-date information and support, the Damage, INC.      
Newsletter will open a lot of users eyes to a more intelligent way of         
bbs'ing.  We constantly refer to this as a "revolution", and I                
whole-heartedly believe the Damage, INC. Newsletter can continue to provide   
unbiased, useful information, thus resulting in a more enlightened h/p scene  
with much more activity.  -TJ

Do you know of any other local h/p groups?  -B

Not as of yet, but I expect to see many "wannabees" pop up trying to imitate  
us.  Damage, INC. and FoI are the foundation of the h/p scene in (519),       
simply because of our long standing presence in the community.  We demand     
respect, we get respect, because of a stability not found in most other       
groups.  (Commenting on the recent Sike dismemberment, and other groups which 
could not make it).  All the power to any other h/p groups that start, and    
I myself will fully support any groups, but only if they appear solid, and    
interested.  -TJ

That's an excellent answer.  Now to a more personal question.  Have you ever  
been idolized and "worshipped" by any local users that are new to the h/p     
scene?  If so, is it something that you dislike?  -B

hehehe, well which hacker hasn't been idolized by Blade Runner <g> but that's
not a bash.  In the past many inexperienced users have been at awe over my    
knowledge of h/p and related topics, and I tend not to really care if they go 
overboard a little :)  This is such a new, changing way of bbs'ing that I     
like to help people where I can.  -TJ

Haha.  ;)  I've had my own experiences with Blade Runner.  Anyways, you've    
done so much to spread information and educate the users that call FoI, but   
is it ever tiresome to be asked lame questions such as "How do I build a      
beige box?" or "How do I hack....whatever?" by users?  In essence, I want to  
know if it becomes annoying to be asked questions about information that's
already online and available on FoI.  -B

Exactly, Blackened.  Honestly? It's insulting.  I go through all the time and 
effort to get files online, make sure all files have descriptions, so when a  
newbie asks me such a question I usually have 4 letters for him - RTFM  -TJ

There's been so much debate recently about bbsing, the internet etc. as it    
relates to the overall h/p scene.  Do you think there's anything wrong with   
quality h/p web sites?  Or, do you believe that the h/p scene should remain   
on a smaller scale... with boards and users that "know each other"?  -B

That is a monumental question, and I'm sure you don't want me to type pages   
of my opinion :)... hehe, I have thought a lot about the internet's effect on 
the bbs scene, and I'm saddened to watch something I've grown to love slowly  
diminish into the shadows of the Internet.  I came to the realization         
recently though, that this is simply because we're letting it rot away.  Its  
time to take back the streets.  Well, bad terminology, but i have nothing     
against the Internet, in fact many of the files on FoI come from the Net.
Its a great source of information, but it can never compare to the intimacy
of a well-run bulletin board system.  -TJ

I completely agree with that.  The internet is good for distribution, but     
doesn't have the same feeling as boards.  On the other hand, I think it's     
good for distribution purposes.  So, do you think Damage, INC. should setup
it's own web site in the future for world wide distribution?  (at the same    
time continue to support boards such as FoI).  -B

Absolutely.  We will have the best of both worlds.  -TJ

Now that we've discussed the internet etc. what future plans do you have in   
store for FoI?  How do you think boards will change in the next 5 years?  ;)
-B

ahh, that is a very interesting question that I have not given that much      
thought to.  I think we will see a merge of the bbs scene and the internet    
in the 21st century.  Each medium complements each-other, and I like to use
this analogy - the bbs scene is like a small village.  The internet is NY     
City.  The two places are worlds apart, but must somehow live together in     
harmony.  To accomplish this, some laws are set by the "big guy", and others  
are allowed to be defined by each individual community/village.   If you      
understand what I'm saying, then good, but if not, then that's understandable 
because that was kinda cryptic :)  -TJ

I do, but I can't speak for the readers.  It's nearing the end of 1997, do    
you think the future of h/p is a bright or dismal one?  Also, do you have     
faith in the new people entering the h/p scene?  Is there any hope that       
they'll learn and help to evolve and progress h/p?  -B

They say there's no such thing as a problem child, its a "problem-parent."    
Its up to you, me, and the person reading this right now to make sure we      
teach our own h/p values, and ways of thinking to the younger generation.     
That means, the future of h/p rests on our shoulder's right now.  If Damage,  
INC. and FoI went down right now, the h/p scene would die.  Its the truth.    
But I look on the bbs's I'm on, and *most* do have an earnest H/P/A/C/T/V     
section.  This pleases me, so I think yes, there is hope.  The next           
generation of h/p'ers are going to be entering the dawn of a millennium.  I'm
sure they'll know what to do.  -TJ

On the same note, do you agree with warez boards trying to be wannabe h/p     
boards?  As in, most of their file areas are filled with warez... while they
also try to support h/p by having a single file area?  -B

Pirated software originated with the same intentions as h/p.  Hackers who     
were broke exchanging useful software to continue their search for the truth. 
Now it seems that has been forgotten, and the 0-2 day warez race is           
dominating the warez culture.  Warez culture has gone to shit, and I want     
h/p to have nothing to do with it.  -TJ

I agree with that.  Here's another interesting question... How do you feel    
about newsletters and magazines that charge money for a subscription?  As you 
already know, the Damage, INC. Newsletter is totally free.  Personally,       
that's something that I believe in strongly.  The spread of h/p information
shouldn't cost the users that want to learn.  Do you agree or disagree with
that statement?  -B

The best things in life are free - that's all I have to say.  -TJ

Would you ever pay to call a h/p board?  -B

Not if I can get the exact same thing for free somewhere else.   No I would   
not pay for a h/p board.  -TJ

Okay, now that we've discussed the "pay for access" aspect of h/p boards etc. 
I'd like to ask you a question about ethics.  If you had the knowledge to     
hack "fictional software", and a user offered to pay you to hack a board      
running under that software... would you become a hacker for hire?  ;)  -B

Wow!, that's a doozy of a question :)  I hope I can say that I would not      
"sell-out" but people do desperate things in desperate times.  How much       
money are we talking about, and what kind of hack does he want?  -TJ

Let's say $50 as an example, and the user/customer wants you to hack the      
system and provide him with the userfile and any passwords necessary to allow
them to logon under Sysop access.  -B

Hmmm... I would promptly tell him to Fuck off.  -TJ

;)  That's a good answer, and I applaud you for having the proper ethics.  I
won't mention any names, but this area is famous for "phreaks" that try to    
sell extenders, pbxs, other codes.  -B

Can I mention a name? :)  -TJ

That's your choice...  -B

hehe... Well its interesting because I once paid this same guy $20 for a      
voicemail box 1800 system a few years back.  So that kinda contradicts my     
answer previously on paying for stuff, but lets just say LL is the most I'll  
give out.  -TJ

Okay, that's fair enough.  Do you think it's right for people to be selling   
codes, internet accounts etc. in order to make profit from the h/p scene (and 
take advantage of naive users that are new to the scene)?  -B

No comment.  -TJ

Okay... Do you think Damage, INC. should ever sell information such as codes, 
accounts etc.?  -B

No.  As long as I am part of that organization, I would not feel comfortable  
selling pwords, codes etc.  I *honestly* must say though, I know its hard to  
turn down $20 or $50 when its handed to you like that, and I don't want to    
seem like some "perfect" h/p'er because that would be more damaging, than to  
admit I am human, and sometimes make mistakes.  -TJ

Yes, we're all flawed.  Personally, I've been offered money ($50 and more),   
but always turned it down in order to maintain my own credibility.  ;)  The
main reason I asked though, was because I believe if you sell codes and other 
information... then you aren't teaching the person anything.  That is, other  
than they can just "buy anything" they want instead of experimenting and      
learning by reading etc.  I don't know of any perfect h/p'er, but I think     
that our motives are honest and noble.  What benefit do you think the Damage, 
INC. Newsletter will have to this area after it's been in publication for a   
few years?  -B

Just to say, you just pinned the tail on the donkey man.  Look at the bible,  
(and although I don't believe in Christianity, I *do* believe Jesus existed). 
"Give a man a fish, feed him for a day, *Teach* a man how to fish, feed him   
for a lifetime."  -TJ

Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to express.  ;)  -B

And to comment on your second question; I have no doubt, those who become     
dedicated readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter will feel a fullness enter   
into their lives, never experienced before.  I feel it is important to stress 
that while Damage, INC. does focus attention on Hacking & Phreaking; It also  
takes a look at society from a whole new perspective, which is beneficial to  
anyone who sees that way as a result of reading our articles.  -TJ

Do you think it's a good idea for this newsletter to include articles that    
were written by people that aren't associated with Damage, INC. (as long as   
they are given full credit)?  -B

Umm, that would depend on the situation really.  At work I clipped out a      
newspaper article from <guiltily> "The SUN" which looked at Di's death from a 
"conspiracy" point of view.  It totally enlightened me to the fact that any   
situation always has two or more sides, and to be objective, you have to try  
and see things from that "other" perspective ;)  -TJ

Good point.  I want to change the topic to trojans now.  How do you feel about
the debug script for NWO being included in this issue?  -B

I think it is a provocative move, and will certainly stir up the bbs scene    
with a big plastic spoon.  The outcome of releasing it can only be left up to 
my imagination, but attention is a positive thing right now, and I see no     
harm in including it.  -TJ

Haha (if it stirs things up, that's cool with me).  Do you think it's a good  
idea to include source and scripts for viruses, trojans and utilities in the  
future issues?  -B

Only to teach readers something new so that they can one day make their own   
viruses/virii :)  I know from personal experience that looking at someone     
else's code accelerates the learning process greatly.  Especially if that code
is explained, line by line.  -TJ

Yes, whatever source code we include should *always* be used as a learning    
tool by our readers.  There's been debate for years about hacking for         
information/hacking and doing damage.  What's your opinion?  This is the      
final question.  I hope you've enjoyed doing this interview.  If you have any 
other comments to make, feel free to write them.  ;)  -B

:) Okay.  Well to answer your initial question;  and this is also a note to   
interested readers, I learnt a lot of information for books such as hmmm bad  
memory, Hacker Crackdown was one, and other various text files on Hackers     
such as Phiber Optik, The Fry Guy (a very controversial case that one)  and   
Captain Crunch.  There was a certain code of ethics that was very plain and   
simple,  but has been cast aside today.  It is this : hacking is to learn     
only.  Hacking a system is to gain some new knowledge about the o/s or        
computer.  If a hacker modifies or deletes files in any way, they cross a
boundary in which Hacking becomes unethical.  This is why hacking has gotten  
such a bad name, because it causes damage.  -TJ

In your opinion though, is it okay to hack an ISP, borrow accounts, use the   
internet for free?  (without doing any damage to any systems)?  -B

Yes, what about you?  -TJ

Yes, I think that's fine... since it should be free.  ;)  Any other comments?
- B

nope  -TJ

Okay.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts and agreeing to do this interview.    
It's the first of many that'll be included in the Damage, INC. Newsletter.
Hopefully, the readers have benefitted by reading this interview... and will
consider what was said here.  -B

That is all I hope too Blackened.  I want to make it clear that my purpose is 
to be service to neophyte h/p'ers who are genuinely interested to learn.   I  
will do my best to help anyone who asks my advice.  This also includes FoI    
Archives at 519-846-8598.  Thanks Blackened, this has been fun :)  -TJ

Thanks again The Journalist.  And to our readers, just remember that you could
also be featured in one of my interviews in the future.  ;)  -B


OBJECTIVE {OPINIONS} -
ONTARIO HYDRO...A MELTDOWN WAITING TO HAPPEN:

The calamity at Ontario Hydro should have received more media attention than
it did.  The general media did not cover the consequences of Hydro's
deteriorating nuclear reactors.  That is what premier Mike Harris and the
fat cat executives at Ontario Hydro counted on.  This newsletter is the
perfect forum to look into this issue further.  Be sure to read the following
facts and objective opinions, and then formulate your own.  Being an informed
person will help you to see through the government's lies and coverups.

After intense public pressure, and a scathing 60-page study by the Atomic
Energy Control Board, Ontario Hydro's gross inefficiency has been fully
exposed.  Hydro's president and CEO, Allan Kupcis couldn't resign fast enough
after it was announced that seven of Ontario's 19 operating nuclear reactors
will supposedly be shut down.

Carl Andognini, leader of the seven member team that wrote the report
concluded that many of Hydro's problems were rooted with people rather than
nuclear technology.  In Andognini's words, Hydro's management acted like a
"feudal fiefdom without professional standards, managerial expertise or, above
all, accountability."  In my words, Hydro's management acted like all the
other government-controlled monopolies.  Hydro has a reported $17.6 billion
invested in their plants.  All they have to show for it are worn-out reactors
that have been leaking various chemicals (most recently deuterium oxide) for
nearly two decades.  Andognini also reports that Hydro has "minimally
acceptable" or "below industry standards" when it comes to normal
operations or being prepared for an emergency, such as a meltdown.

Rocked by being exposed by the truth, officials are desperately trying to
keep the big fat boat afloat.  Hydro has convinced Andognini to join them.
He claims he will start initiating the recommendations in his report.
Andogini has promised to remain for 3´ years.  He is optimistic that he can
turn the nuclear division around.  Three coal and oil-fired generating plants
have been reactivated.  They will make up for the power loss that will be
caused by the dormant reactors.

During its years as a government-controlled monopoly, Hydro has accrued a
huge debt.  The Ontario government has guaranteed $24 billion of Hydro's
debt.  Upgrade costs for an additional 12 reactors will cost Ontario
taypayers an estimated $3.6 billion now, and $5.8 billion over the next
four years.  Of course costs will mostly likely be much more, since those
estimates come from the Ontario government.  One additional cost that Hydro
didn't include is the cost of shutting down seven reactors (four at the
Pickering plant, three at the Bruce plant) over the span of a 30 year period.
Plus the closed plants will have to be staffed to monitor radiation levels.

The fate of Ontario Hydro is still unfolding.  Ontario premier Mike Harris
has been sitting on his hands, unwilling to give up the government's
communist-like believe that they need to control the hydroelectric power
industry.  Andognini responds to the question of deregulation by predicting
Hydro will be ready for an "open market" in 2 years.  However, competition
and deregulation are words that are foreign in this red province.

Ontario Hydro's actions should be of great concern.  Due to gross
mismanagement, Hydro's nuclear reactors have not been properly maintained
and are operating past their prime.  Chemical leaks have been occurring on a
consistent basis for 20 years, although many have been covered up until
now.  It is not unreasonable to agree with Andognini's finding that Hydro
is at best minimally prepared for a huge disaster.  Therefore, we have old,
poorly maintained reactors and staff that are not prepared.  In my opinion,
that leads me to believe that there is a realistic chance of meltdown at any
of the nuclear reactors.

The Ontario Hydro monopoly must end.  It has proven to be a total failure.
They have lost all of their credibility and should not be trusted.  Hydro is
a tremendous drain on taxpayers and a disaster waiting to happen.  A disaster
that could make Chernobyl look like a little bit of acid rain.  The only
sensible course of action is for Hydro to get out of the power business.  The
entire industry should be deregulated and opened up to competition.  In the
United States, the power industry has been deregulated in some states since
1992.  Since then five nuclear power plants have been shut down because they
were fiscally unreasonable.  More economical ways were found to provide those
areas with power.

Unfortunately it is business as usual at Ontario's disgraced power
monopoly.  Now Ontario Hydro is talking about "shutting down the reactors
at the end of their lifespan."  As the nuclear reactors continue to deteriorate,
Harris can't let go of any power.  He is hellbent on becoming the dictator of
Ontario, and controlling the only source of power in Ontario gives *him* power.  And
Ontario Hydro's executives (new and old) are in a mode of panic, doing
anything they can to maintain their monopoly.  With no competitors
(predators) they can continue to operate under the status quo.  The scandal
will be forgotten by most of the media and public until Hydro faces another
self induced disaster.  We can only hope that the next one doesn't cost us all
our lives.  CANDU can meltdown.

{REPORTS} FROM THE FRONT -
WINDOWS NT LIES By ED BOTT        Garnered from ZDNet

What is it about the computer industry that compels people to stretch the
truth past the breaking point? Every week we dig through a pile of press
releases, news clippings, white papers, and reviewer's guides, most of them
filled with rumors, half-truths, exaggerations, false conclusions, tap
dancing, and spin that's gone completely out of control. Not to mention
outright whoppers.

This year, for the third straight year, we've gathered a collection of the ten
most popular lies about the trendiest technology.  In 1995 it was no trouble
to round up ten lies about Windows 95. Last year we focused on the Internet.

Death by NC

This year we set our sights on Microsoft Windows NT. Why NT? After Microsoft
tacked the Windows 95 shell onto NT, it was suddenly the hottest software
around, and when you're hot, people talk. But the trouble with NT is its
enormous complexity, which makes it hard to craft a simple marketing message.
That means Microsoft occasionally oversimplifies issues and smooths over the
rough edges in NT. And Microsoft bashers can have a field day using technical
trivia to reach unwarranted conclusions.
Just once, we'd like to read a press release that didn't sound like an outtake
from Jim Carrey's Liar Liar. Somehow we don't think that's going to happen
anytime soon, though. Want to know what's really going on with Windows NT?
We've got the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

Lie 1

NT Works with Most PCs

What's made DOS and Windows so successful? Arguably, it's their run- anywhere
nature. Take a shopping cart full of spare PC parts, slap 'em into a case, and
you'll be able to boot up Windows 95. But try the same experiment with NT, and
you'll probably find yourself staring at the dreaded Blue Screen of Death.
Microsoft claims that "Windows 95 supports one-third more device drivers than
does Windows NT Workstation (approximately 1,000 more drivers). . . However,
certain types of devices, such as video, audio, and PCMCIA are areas where
Windows NT Workstation support falls short of Windows 95." Right conclusion,
wrong numbers. In the interest of science, we pulled down the Windows 95 and
NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility Lists (HCL) and started counting.
There are nearly 1,500 more entries on the Windows 95 HCL than on its NT 4.0
counterpart. Surprisingly, there are 397 more printers and 565 more analog
modems on NT's HCL, leading one to suspect that those categories on the
Windows 95 HCL haven't been updated recently. One in three x86 systems that
work with Windows 95 sputters and dies when faced with NT. If you've got an
older audio adapter or network card, you'll probably need to replace it before
you upgrade your operating system. NT experts won't even think of purchasing
hardware without checking the HCL. Now you know why.


Lie 2

NT Is Less Secure Than Unix

Judging by the flurry of headlines in the first half of 1997, the most popular
sport on college campuses is hacking Microsoft software. This year's most
serious NT security scare first popped up on newsgroups in March with the
release of PWDump and NTCrack, a pair of homegrown utilities that let system
administrators attack the encrypted password file on an NT machine in search
of weak passwords. The story spread to the mainstream press at Internet speed
after Electronic Engineering Times published a front-page story with the
screaming headline "'Hack' punches hole in NT nets' security." The conclusion?
System administrators should avoid NT in favor of the inherently safer Unix
operating system.

The EE Times story was riddled with technical errors, and it completely
missed the point. Both Unix and NT have ample security features, including
industrial-strength logon routines and well-protected file systems. Any idiot
can configure any server--Unix or NT--so that its built-in security is
compromised. The new utilities are simply NT versions of well-known Unix
programs that sniff out insecure passwords by comparing them with entries in a
dictionary. For a hacker to take advantage of NTCrack, he or she would first
have to log on as a member of the Administrators group. And once an evildoer
penetrates the network, there are far more interesting things to do than
decode passwords.


Lie 3

Upgrading from Win95 Is Easy

The single most compelling new feature in NT 4.0 is the Windows 95 shell. So
there's an easy upgrade path from Windows 95 to NT 4.0, right? Wrong. In fact,
while upgrading to NT 4.0 from any older version of Windows or DOS is
painless, installing NT over Windows 95 is impossible.
Blame it on fundamental incompatibilities in the system registries for Windows
95 and NT. While you're at it, sprinkle a heaping helping of responsibility on
Windows 95's anything-goes support for oddball hardware and virtual device
drivers (VxDs). Because NT has no way to detect installed devices, doesn't
recognize VxDs, uses incompatible hardware drivers, and may not recognize the
file system in use, Microsoft wisely chose to not even try migrating the
Windows 95 registry to Windows NT.
If you're planning to move from Windows 95 to NT 4.0, here's what you have to
do: First, check your system inventory against the official Microsoft NT
Hardware Compatibility List (at www. microsoft. com/ hwtest), and make sure
your main hard drive is formatted using the FAT file system. Next, install
Windows NT into its own directory and reinstall every application as well.
Even if you're exceptionally well organized, the upgrade will probably take
several days from start to finish.
Microsoft's Migration Market Bulletin sheepishly acknowledges the problem and
offers this bold-faced promise: "Microsoft is completely committed to fixing
this issue in the next major release of Windows NT Workstation." Now all they
have to do is figure out how.


Lie 4

NT Meets Military Standards

Windows NT has earned a C2 rating from the U.S. National Security Agency
(NSA), the spookiest of all the shadowy spy shops surrounding Washington, DC.
That's an impressive accomplishment, but only if you look at how much red tape
Microsoft had to go through to get there. In practical terms, the C2 rating is
underwhelming at best. Here's why.
As Microsoft freely admits, no operating system is ever C2-certified. Instead,
the spymasters bestow C2 certification on a specific installation, and the
computer's operating system is only one small piece of that puzzle. If you
plan to install a C2-compliant system, don't expect to connect with the rest
of the world, either-- Microsoft chose to submit NT 3.5 for C2 approval (NT
4.0 hasn't been tested yet) using the NSA's "Orange Book" testing procedures
instead of the more stringent "Red Book." That saved time, but it means that
NT is certifiably secure only without any network connections. Would you
install a copy of NT Server without connecting it to another computer? Of
course not. But as soon as you do, you lose the C2 rating.
Gee, maybe Microsoft should have applied for the Catch-22 rating instead. . .


Lie 5

NT is Robust and Crash-proof

Everything's relative, especially when the topic turns to the stability of
Windows. Is NT robust? Compared with Windows 95, it's as solid as Gibraltar. A
buggy application locks up Windows 95 so tight only the power switch can undo
the damage. Run the same ill-behaving app under NT, and the app itself
vanishes in a puff of virtual smoke--leaving the rest of the system running
without so much as a hiccup.
Unfortunately, robust doesn't mean crash-proof. True, you reboot less often,
but NT has a long way to go before it consistently achieves the uptime that
Unix users take for granted. A buggy driver or a memory conflict in NT's
internals typically results in STOP errors, also known as the Blue Screen of
Death, a fatal listing of hexadecimal memory addresses and module names in
bright white letters on a blue background. Even more insidious are memory
leaks, which slowly drain resources from the operating system until
performance becomes so sluggish that rebooting is the only alternative.
Unfortunately, the Blue Screen of Death isn't rare. Microsoft has created a
special Web-based troubleshooter to help you decode the top 15 STOP error
messages. Most depressing of all, these crashes are so common that they've
earned the ultimate in backhanded compliments--their own widely used acronym,
BSOD.

NT Server Is Worth More

One box is white, the other is blue. That's not the only distinction between
NT Server (NTS) and NT Workstation (NTW), but you'll need to look at the code
under a powerful microscope to find more substantial differences. NT has only
one kernel, you see, and that core code is absolutely identical, no matter
which version you install.
Microsoft argues that NTS uses that kernel differently; according to
Microsoft, the installation process for NTS makes as many as 700 subtle
changes to entries in the NT registry, including memory- management settings
and other configuration options. There's also a bundle of utilities and system
service software in the NTS box that you won't find if you buy the
lower-priced NTW package. But the biggest difference is monetary, not
technical. At current street prices, you pay $450 extra--about a 150 percent
premium--to install NTS instead of NTW. If you plan to run a Web server at
your site, you're caught between a rock and a hard place: Even though
third-party Web servers run just fine on NTW, Microsoft's license agreement
won't let you legally run any server software if more than ten users will
access the site simultaneously. The NTS license, on the other hand, allows
unlimited connections to your Web server over the Internet; it also includes
Microsoft's Internet Information Server 3.0, which eliminates the need for
that third-party Web-server software.
There's no technical barrier to stop you from simply ignoring the license
agreement and running O'Reilly's WebSite or Netscape's FastTrack Server. Of
course, you would be violating the Microsoft license agreement, and a
disgruntled employee could turn you in to the Business Software Alliance, with
consequences including stiff fines and public humiliation. But hey--it's your
business.

NT Works Great on a Notebook

If you've grown accustomed to Windows 95's world-class support for portable
PCs, your blood pressure will soar an hour into your first cross-country
flight with an NT notebook.
Windows 95 can dim the screen, shut down the hard drive, and turn off PC Card
devices to squeeze extra life out of a battery. NT doesn't do power
management, period--all systems run at full tilt until they can't run anymore.
Windows 95 lets you swap PC Cards on the fly. NT has surprisingly good PC Card
drivers, but you have to restart the system each time you add a new device if
you expect the operating system to recognize it.
Thanks to Windows 95's Plug and Play, you can slip a notebook out of its
docking station, carry it down the hall to a meeting, and begin taking notes
without missing a beat. NT forces you to reboot and choose a new hardware
profile each time you change working environments.
Microsoft promises NT 5.0 will be a better traveler. We'll see. Meanwhile, if
you need to run NT on the road, ask IBM or Digital Equipment to show you the
custom code they've written to handle power management and simulate Plug and
Play. And be sure to stock up on extra batteries.

NT Will Kill Windows 95

What do you get when you cross a conspiracy theorist with a technology
analyst? Add a dash of paranoia to your basic business- school model, and it's
easy to see patterns where none exist.  Take Windows 95 and NT. When Windows
95 debuted, some analysts theorized that it was simply a placeholder that
would quietly disappear when Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft's real strategic
product, appeared. If that's true, then Windows 95 has been the most
successful disposable consumer product ever introduced.

Windows 95 and Windows NT have completely different target markets. The former
is aimed directly at home users, for whom fun and games are a higher priority
than productivity. Windows NT, on the other hand, requires a secure logon and
refuses to acknowledge the existence of many games, which makes it a model
citizen in the corporate world.
Someday Windows 95 and NT will share a common code base. Just this year
Microsoft product planners hinted that the merged kernel will be ready in
1999. Of course, those same sources predicted that Windows 4.0 would be on
store shelves in mid-1994. Come back in 2001 and we'll tell you all about the
latest updates to Windows 95 and Windows NT.

Zero Administration Is Here

Bill Gates has built an entire industry around mainframe-killing,
terminal-replacing, do-it-all-on-the-desktop, industry-standard PCs. So
longtime Windows watchers savored the irony when Microsoft announced its Zero
Administration Windows initiative. The idea behind ZAW is simple: Rein in
those maverick desktop PCs and put them back in the firm grip of network
administrators, with preconfigured, locked-down systems.
That's a convenient way to keep support personnel from having to rescue poor
dumb users, but it's hard to imagine those users willingly surrendering their
desktop PCs. Besides, it doesn't even begin to address the real burdens of PC
ownership, which still requires hours of upfront administrative effort before
a user can get to work.
Zero Administration Windows? Is Microsoft kidding? Maybe it is. One press
release from Microsoft makes this telling admission: "In effect, 'Zero
Administration' means zero administration for users." Administrators still
have to install Windows and approved applications on each user's PC, but they
won't have to clean up after those darned users. What will network managers do
Quake.

Network PCs Will Kill NT

If the computer industry didn't exist, high-tech honchos like Sun
Microsystems' Scott McNealy, Oracle's Larry Ellison, and Microsoft's Bill
Gates would probably have become pro wrestlers. They've certainly mastered the
art of bluster, and the typical product demo, like a World Wrestling
Federation pay-per-view extravaganza, bears only the most casual relation to
reality.
Take the tag-team match that has pitted the Oracle Network Computer and the
Sun JavaStation against the Microsoft/Intel NetPC. Sun, which owns the Java
programming language, argues that a fleet of users equipped with Web browsers
can run any business, as long as Java is powering the servers. Oracle adds the
technical flourish of an NC Card--a smart card that unlocks your personal
profile on the network. Microsoft and Intel, of course, contend that Windows
makes a perfectly good network computer (NC), once you trim away some of its
extra features.
Don't expect your desktop computer to disappear anytime soon, however.
Dataquest, for example, forecasts that sales of network computers in all forms
may hit a few million by the year 2000. By contrast, businesses and consumers
are expected to buy more than 132 million PCs (most equipped with some version
of Windows) in the first year of the millennium. Java is a work in progress,
and it'll be years before it's widely used on desktop PCs. For most businesses
NCs will replace aging mainframe terminals, not PCs.

{SOURCE} AND SCRIPTS -
THE NWO TROJAN:

This is the source code and debug scripts section.  We're going to try to
include a different virus, trojan or utility every month.  Since this is the
first issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter, I thought we'd start by featuring
a special trojan.  The NWO trojan is in the spotlight this month.  Damage, INC.
is proud to release the debug script for New World Order.  If you wanted or
expected the source code, that's too fucking bad.  ;)  In order to use NWO,
you'll need to clip out the debug script below and save it to a file called
NWO.SCR.  Then, execute DEBUG < NWO.SCR at a DOS prompt to assemble it.  If you
followed those instructions properly, you'll see a file named NWO.COM that is
exactly 830 bytes.

40-HEX magazine often used this method for including viruses etc.  It's the
safest, easiest and best method to use in my opinion, thus Damage, INC. has
chosen to use debug scripts.  We decided to explain how to use DEBUG in case
some readers are beginners and have no experience in this area.  In future
issues, we won't explain how to use this method in detail.  Always remember:

DEBUG < FILENAME.EXT - to assemble debug script files.

NWO is a powerful trojan that nukes the cursor, keyboard, and all hard drives
(C: to Z:) on the system.  It also writes a New World Order message to every
hard drive.  Upon completion, it coldboots the victim's system.  We recommend
being cautious with NWO.  Use at your own risk.  Damage, INC. isn't responsible
if you nuke yourself with anything that we release.  In the next issue, we're
planning to include a copy of RAZORBACK...if it has been fully tested and is
ready.  At any rate, enjoy NWO by Damage, INC.


˙---[The Journalist's Top Ten List. ]---˙


    One of the regular features of the Damage, INC. Newsletter will be my
top ten list.  Yes I stole the idea from David Letterman, but who cares? :)
This list will be funnier than his, so read on!
    After one of the shortest summers to date, school is back in, and for all
you suckers out there who have to attend, there are a few simple things that
can make school-life into a bearable day.
    But remember, in the event that you get caught, you cannot reveal
anything regarding a "damaging" newsletter or some such shit. 


{TOP TEN} List of Pranks to pull at school:
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ

    1. At lunch hour, drop a *BANANA* (not a banana-peel) into a congested
       hallway.  Watch as people walk over or around the banana, but when
       your mark is the high-school snob who keeps his/her nose pointed to
       the ceiling, you're sure to be in for a laugh.
    2. A oldie but goodie, try and exchange the O'Canada tape for Adam Sandler
       or Howard Stern.  It has to be something with bad taste, otherwise the
       joke just isn't fun! ;)
    3. When a minor-niner asks you for directions, give him the directions
       to the principal's office, then go to an empty room and page the
       principals secretary.  Tell her you are a new teacher here, and this
       student just started masturbating in class.  Only do this to people
       who aren't suicidal ;)
    4. Tie a strand of fishing line across the bottom of some stairs in the
       school somewhere.  Sit back and laugh as people "launch" their books
       into the crowd of people.  A good one to fuck over the much-hated
       "brown-noser" who deserves to have his perfect notes scattered around
       the floor for everyone to steal.
    5. This one doesn't need much explanation  -  Go to the Party Hut in
       Stone Rd. Mall and pick up a box of stink bombs.  If you execute this
       right, the school might have to be evacuated and you get to miss class.
    6. Another way to miss class is call in a bomb threat from the payphone
       inside the school.  You could even go to the lengths of creating a
       "fake" bomb, complete with ticking clock.  Tell the authorities you
       will blow up the school if the principal does not admit to the students
       he used to fuck sheep when he was a kid.  (make sure you get that one
       on videotape!) :)
    7. Try your hand at lock-picking.  You'd be surprised at how little guilt
       you feel over stealing a niner's new discman.
    8. Sneak into the Cooking class and exchange flour for custard powder,
       cayenne pepper for baking soda.  Fill the vanilla extract bottle with
       40% Rum instead.  And if you're really generous, you could even drop
       a few hits of acid in there.  Once again, make sure your mark is not
       suicidal! ;)
    9. Find the school's biggest browner, and when he's in the library
       (when *ISN'T* the geek in the library??) slip a book into his bag when
       he's not looking.  The student will probably stroll right past the
       detectors, and BEEP BEEP BEEP! His face will go red, and you and your
       friends will be laughing hysterically in the corner.  If you have a
       particular hatred for this guy, slip a homemade "sheet of acid" or a
       baggie full of oregano into his bag.  Watch him talk his way out of that
       one!
   10. Drop laxative into the new teacher's coffee.  If you've never tried this
       before, do it!  Such a simple manoeuvre can cause so much shit its
       hilarious ;)


{CLOSING} COMMENTS:

The first issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter is now a reality and a success.
The h/p scene in this area was lacking a source of information, and now we
are providing it to everyone.  A forum for the discussion of these topics was
needed.  It should be the duty of those in the local h/p scene to contribute
articles and lend support to us.  Otherwise, the h/p scene locally will weaken
and slowly die a painful death... It's obvious that 519 is already infested
with lamers, warez pups and politically correct idiots.  They are the enemy.
Don't allow them to take control of this area and destroy interest in h/p.
With continued growth, the h/p scene in this area has the potential to become
respected and powerful.  That being said, Damage, INC. is proud to welcome
The Journalist as our newest Member.  We also have an announcement to make:
Freedom of Information Archives is the new Damage, INC. Dist. Site.  It will
distribute our releases to Guelph and surrounding area.  We were already the
force in this area, but now Damage, INC. is *the* source for h/p information.
We've grown and become even stronger.  ;)

In the next issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter, look for articles about
Big Brother and encryption, the Media, Bell, more h/p information, and more
conspiracies and corruption being exposed.  Also, we are planning to include
the RAZORBACK trojan as well as a list of h/p web sites for you to check out.

We're looking for Writers, Members and Distribution Sites.  If you'd like to
apply to Damage, INC. and join a respected h/p group, then download a copy of
the Damage, INC. Application Generator.  If you want any of our text releases,
trojans and utilities they are available on the following boards:

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL - Damage, INC. WHQ, h/p/a/c/v/t, no ratios, invite only.
Freedom of Information Archives - Damage, INC. Dist. Site, h/p/a/c/v/t.

In the future, we plan to setup the Damage, INC. web site to distribute our
releases.  If you have any comments or suggestions, contact us at one of the
boards above.
