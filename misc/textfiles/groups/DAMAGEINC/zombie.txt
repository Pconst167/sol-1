===============================================================================

"A pathetic zombie race."

Blood dripping from the sky.
Over and over you hear the hideous cries.
Desperation.

Covering the ground are bodies in tatters.
Their dreams have been shattered.
Disposable heroes.

In battle they fought for social evolution.
There wasn't a conclusion or resolution.
No revolution.

Brave souls with a cause were attacked and decimated.
Their very existence was removed, destroyed and eliminated.
Chaotic evil.

Big Brother's mind control and ignorant teachings were victorious.
Disinformation, propaganda and lies.  For that they are notorious.
Weapons of mass destruction.

The men did not seek any followers or pity.
Big Brother was their foe.  An enemy that defines and lives for infamy.
Dissidents.

Glory, honor and truth were what they respected.
Those very things were what the vast majority utterly rejected.
Zombies.

Indifference and ignorance ruled.
Again and again the zombies were fooled.
Blindness.

Their will and independence crushed.
Now Big Brother is all that the zombies trust.
Overpowered.

Individuality and freedom were lost.
Now they were mere puppets...controlled and brainwashed.
No resistance.

Their rights, choices and chances were now gone.
Afterall, they chose not to fight and Big Brother had won.
Defeated.

They ignored the warnings.  They refused to wage war.
Indeed, the zombies supported and believed Big Brother.  Whenever they were
stripped, raped and beaten they went back and asked for more.
Naive.

Influenced and constantly being manipulated by Big Brother.
Truth and lies were now the same.  They couldn't tell one from another.
Puppets.

Yes, the gullible zombies were influenced by all of the false promises.  They
believed the shit and did what they were told.
In the end, they weren't human beings.  Their strings could be pulled at will
by Big Brother and they were frequently imprisoned, bought and sold.
Enslaved.

Life in captivity is what they chose.
Slavery under Big Brother is something they simply could not oppose.
Weak.

Was this way of life torture to them?  Were the zombies upset or enraged?
No, it was Utopia.  They actually believed they were living in a gilded cage.
Controlled.

The land wasn't theirs to own.  The decisions weren't theirs to make.
But Big Brother repeatedly assured them that his way was best.  He decided
everything for them, for their own sake.
Brainwashed.

However, the zombies were all satisfied with the way things were.  They
were peaceful and content.
Was their happiness real?  Or was it artificial... twisted and bent?
Fake.

To them though, it was real.  For they acted on emotion and rejected all logic.
They were disillusioned fools.  They just couldn't see that it was wrong,
demented and sick.
Deceived.

Arm themselves?  Pointless.  Fight back?  Unacceptable and dangerous.
Relinquish civil rights and liberties?  Fair.  Victimized and controlled?
Socially acceptable and part of going with the flow.
Conformity.

Their silence was deafening and deadly.
It killed any chance of reform, quickly and effectively.
Self-Sabotage.

The zombies loved ignorance and always strived to be perfect, willing victims.
Never speak out.  Never oppose.  Never question.  Always support the system.
Mindless.

They gave in and had betrayed the very people that were fighting for them.
The zombies were alone.  On their behalf, there was nobody left to fend.
Helpless.
