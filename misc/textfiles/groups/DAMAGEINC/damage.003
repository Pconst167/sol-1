BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
The Internet:  Big Brother's pride and joy.

The Internet is well known for the mass amounts of information that are
available to its users all around the world.  As millions of people
obliviously post email and in newsgroups, or move from web site to web
site, Big Brother is watching.  Never before has it been so easy for Big
Brother to profit from the private information it has obtained, as well as
track Internet users' activities.

It is sickening, but not shocking, how many databases that contain private
information are accessible on the Internet.  Do you know how easy it is for
someone to find your phone number, email address, and street address?  Or
that extremely sensitive information like your SIN/SSN number is probably
available on a pay-for-query database?  It is very easy.  The more active
you are on the Internet, the more chances Big Bro has to learn about you.

It is Big Brother's intent to create online dossiers by collecting vast
amount of data, and indexing said data by your name.  A search engine could
retrieve your dossier, and then the searcher could examine it.  Every bit
of personal data, personal habits, newsgroup posts, etc. would all be
disclosed without your knowledge.

That information can easily be used against you.  With the information that
is available, your identity could be easily stolen from you.  Decades from
now, your words can be used against you.  In essence, Big Brother can use
the Internet to destroy you...or to control you.

For many people, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are their link to the
Internet.  What most Internet users don't consider is that their ISP
operator could be bought out by Big Brother.  How else do you think Yahoo,
Hotbot and their kin maintain their email databases?  ISP operators sell
them!  If you chose to be a legitimate Internet user (use an account under
your own name) that means that the ISP has your real name, street address,
telephone number, plus any other information you had to give them.  Does
that information get sold as well?  Can your particular ISP be trusted to
keep your personal information private?  Those are the questions you should
ask when choosing an ISP.

Don't forget that the system administrator can sniff your TCP/IP packets or
use a protocol analyzer to see what you are up to.  I have also been
informed that different types are logs are created, and can't be cleaned up
unless your ISP allows you to have a shell account.

Everyone that has used Internet Email should realize that their
Username@Location attached to every post.  Therefore, every email posted
can easily be traced back to you.  And in any event, your ISP could
possibly has a copy of your message backed up.

Big Brother has created scanners that scan email messages for "obscene"
words.  It is not unreasonable to believe that your email is scanned for
private information that can be added to your dossier.  Plus the
administrator of your ISP can read all of your incoming and outgoing email.
If you use the Internet at work, your employer has a legal right to read
your email.  And do you know for sure if an email message is purged after
you delete it?

Big Brother has found that the World Wide Web is an excellent way to track
Internet users, and to learn more about their personal interests.  First of
all, when you connect to a web site/page the TCP/IP packet contains your
your origin site (ISP address) and username.  From that information, your
email address can be ascertained.  With your email address, it is very easy
for a web site operator to find out any other personal information, like
your real name, street address, telephone number, etc.  Of course, all the
activities you perform and are logged in a cookie file.

Also, any information you have inputted on the web site will be in the
cookie file, as well as a database on the actual site.  Web sites can read
cookie files to find out other information, such as the last web site you
have visited.  If you return to the site without deleting the cookie file,
it reloads all of what you did during previous visits.

With all of the information at their disposal, they can do virtually
anything.  They can spam you with advertising targeted at your perceived
interests, sell what they have found to marketing firms, etc.

As you can imagine, the battle to keep information private has been lost.
The only hope that remains is to give users the option to access the Internet
anonymously.  Various techniques have been implemented to that end.
Anonymous (email) remailers, and the services provided by web proxy servers
try to provide anonymity to Internet users.  However, anonymous web browsing
and email are currently unsophisticated and underdeveloped.  Big Brother and
hackers will always find ways to defeat the anonymizing systems.  Obviously,
the best way to access the internet anonymously is to use a "borrowed" account
that contains none of your information.  Big Brother can't track you then.

I am certain that this will be the first of many articles on Big Brother
and the Internet.  To expose every area of the Internet that Big Brother
has infiltrated is impossible in this one article.  :-(  The intention of
this article is:

1)  To make you aware of how much of your personal information is easily
    attainable from the Internet.
2)  To let you know how easy it is for Big Brother to link you to your      
    Internet activities.

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Practical uses for batch files:

Here's a quick tip.  The batch file below can be used as a shell to DOS
utility (or backdoor if you prefer to call it that).  Just put it onto a menu
and have it execute it like a door.  You can also convert it to a filename.com
by using a BAT2EXEC utility... to make it more difficult to read.  ;)

@Echo Off
ctty com1
command

You should create your own batch files, to automate any of the repetitive
commands you do on your system.  The DOS manual isn't the greatest reference
to use, but most people already have a copy of it just collecting dust on a
shelf somewhere.  As a start, I suggest you try to learn more about batch
programming by reading through your DOS manual.  After that, you can download
a more advanced reference like TSBAT50.ZIP and learn from those examples.

Programming batch files to perform tasks is a simple, efficient way to improve
your system.  They can be very useful if properly applied.  Also, using a batch
file for frequently used commands is a real time saver.  We've included a copy
of DAMZIP.BAT.  It's a small (only 650 bytes) batch file that adds zip comments
to .ZIP files and includes bbs ads in them as well.  Simply clip out the code,
and save it to a file named DAMZIP.BAT.  Then, you will need to modify it
slightly so that it works on your system.  As in, change the paths from c:\ads\
to the directory that contains the ascii zip comment file... and your bbs ads.
Obviously, the filenames must also be changed to match the files you are going
to use for the zip comment and bbs ads.  DAMZIP uses .ZIP as a default extension
so it's not necessary to enter a filename extension when using it.

DAMZIP filename # - Processes a single .ZIP file.
DAMZIP * # - Processes *.ZIP files in the current directory.

You can select the zip comment file by using the # switch.  Examples:

DAMZIP * 4 - Processes *.ZIP (all .ZIP files in the current directory) and
             uses justice4.asc as the zip comment.

DAMZIP damage-3 1 - Processes damage-3.zip only and uses justice1.asc as the
                    zip comment.

CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
Mondex and Electronic Cash:  From 1s to 0s
 
For thousands of years, humans have exchanged currency for goods and
services.  Currency has always had some real value.  In ancient times,
currency was judged on the composition of a coin.  Gold coins were
literally "worth their weight in gold."  In modern times, governments issue
paper money and coins.  Most modern currency doesn't obtain its value from
composition.  They are backed by the gold reserves of that particular
country.  The currency only becomes worthless when the country totally
collapses.  Chartered banks are also afforded protections from that
country's reserve bank, so that innocent citizens don't lose all of their
money if the bank goes bankrupt.
 
For some reason, governments and "society" wants to change the tried and
true method of real currency.  With the introduction of "smart" cards, it
will be possible for corporations to issue "electronic money."  Of course
these companies are outside of the regulated banking system, so they are
not afforded any protections that currency and bank deposits do.  Unlike
cash, electronic money has nothing backing it up.  You must trust the
corporation holding your money completely!

Smart cards look like any plastic credit or debit card.  They differ in
that they do not rely on magnetic strip technology.  Inside of a smart card
is a microprocessor that is capable of storing, sending and receiving
information.  To put electronic cash on the card, one must go to an ATM
machine and download it onto the smart card.  The money in your bank
account is gone.  It now only exists on the smart card.  These cards are
also referred to as a Stored Value Card.  You then may go to businesses
that have a compatible smart card system to purchase items or services.
 
Gee, doesn't cold hard cash do the same thing?  ;)  What is the advantage
gained by using electronic cash?  The only advantage I've heard is "I don't
have a whole bunch of change in my pocket."  Haha... In reply I say that
you can easily have nothing in your pocket...and in the "smart" card.
 
Mondex International is one of many corporations that are competing to
establish their technology as the standard electronic cash system.  They
currently have pilot programs under way in various small cities in, such as
Guelph, Ontario.
 
The current Mondex system requires an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) of a
participating bank to put money onto a card.  Then the electronic cash can
be used at retailers that are participating in the trial.  Mondex cards are
also capable of performing card-to-card electronic cash transfers.  Of
course, the transfer is offline, so Mondex's records have to be updated at
an ATM.  Fat cat banks and corporations that back Mondex are MasterCard
International (which owns 51% of Mondex), Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, and the most corrupt of them all, Bell Canada.
 
What Mondex users may not know is that Mondex once claimed that all of
their transfers were "anonymous, just like cash."  They said this in a
previous pilot program in Swindon, United Kingdom.  However, Privacy
International made a formal complaint, exposing Mondex's lie.  A lie that
should be obvious since each Mondex card has its own unique ID number.  It
may be of interest to Guelph Mondex users that CIBC was planning on
creating dossiers and marketing reports on all Mondex users that would use
their ATM machines.
 
While telling Mondex users that their system was "anonymous", they told the
participating banks and corporations that "the Mondex card system is fully
auditable.  There is an electronic record of the time, date, amount, and
participants of each transaction."  Huh?  How can something be "anonymous"
and "fully auditable" at the same time?  Mondex is really trying to have it
both ways.  Mondex was caught in a blatant lie.  And yet you are expected
to trust them with your money!  What integrity does this corporation have?
 
The truth is that the Mondex auditing system is complete enough to invade
the privacy of users, but not "fully auditable."  A Mondex card has a very
limited amount of storage.  Therefore, an active "offline" Mondex user can
overflow the memory, causing data loss.  And were talking "money" here, so
data loss means money loss.  If the electronic cash is lost in cyberlimbo,
or if the card is damaged guess who benefits?  The word `Mondex' should
come to mind.
 
The flaws in the Mondex auditing system leaves the entire system very
vulnerable to fraud.  Imagine an organized crime syndicate creating a huge
amount of counterfeit electronic cash?  Mondex would meltdown.  And if
Mondex's system is compromised by fraud, who pays in the end?  Let's put it
this way, you might as well take your Mondex card and melt it down.  You
won't be able to access the money on your card because Mondex will shut its
system down.
 
Are you skeptical that Mondex can indeed meltdown?  I'll quote Mondex's
`top security man'.  "Let's be honest -- no system is fraud-proof.  If I
were to claim Mondex is fraud-proof, you'd say I was an idiot.  And you'd
be right. We don't claim that.  The system has to be built to tolerate a
loss. If you don't design your system like that, you've had it.  We've
designed a system that will tolerate loss."
 
Mondex is ready to "tolerate a loss."  Are you?  Are you prepared to lose
everything when Mondex's system is compromised?  Mondex doesn't care.
They'll just change their internal encryption scheme and send you a new
card with an apology letter.  Are you prepared for your Mondex card to be
shut down if Mondex is suspicious of fraudulent activity?  Do you believe it
could be shut down just before you need to pay for lunch, or taxi fare?
Cash just doesn't disappear like the insecure electronic version can.  ;)

If you use a Mondex card, you are a puppet...and Mondex is pulling your
strings.  There is a price to be paid if you have the need to be
"high-tech."  If Mondex cards are distributed throughout North America,
Europe, and the rest of the world, we'll all have to decide whether we will
use a smart card or cash.  Damage, INC. just wanted to warn you that Mondex
and other similar "smart cards" aren't as secure as they claim to be, and
aren't as fast or convenient as cash.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Corruption and Greed in our Global Markets:

..an article by the journalist

FOREWORD:
    In writing this article, I want to make you aware of some of the reasons
behind the hacking/phreaking/anarchy/viruses/carding scene.  Why do people
join together to learn about information that goes "against the state?"
Why do people risk themselves to participate in illegal activity?
Big Brother sees this as a form of treason... and I think if you learn
the philosophy behind h/p, you will understand why *we* think our gov't 
officials are the real perpetrators.

    Corruption is the cancer of our society.  It eats away at the living
flesh from the inside out.  Corruption multiplies, it mutates, and it 
infects.  Ask any politician what their original motives were for getting 
into politics.  Compare their answer to what their current activities are.
You will most like see the "greed virus" has overtaken their psyche.  They 
have seen the briefcases of bribe money in front of them, and they were 
weak.  Their weakness becomes manifested in society as "cutbacks" and 
"downsizing."  
    Of course none of this can be proven.  
    What I can prove though, is what happens globally and nationally in our
economic system.  How corruption and greed in our global markets have caused
a once stable system to fall to its knees.  How individual and mass 
decisions affect entire nations' economic balance.  I will also provide you
with educated predictions on current cover-ups of corruption/greed in 
economic markets.
    Who is the criminal behind the mask in most of these situations?  Either
the United States Gov't, or large corporations such as Microsoft, McDonalds,
Coca-Cola, etc.  As an example, when you buy a CD such as Pearl Jam, or 
Spice Girls...<g> you are paying around $20.00 when all is said and done. 
Let me give you a general price break-down for your $20.00:
		
		Cost of CD to produce: $1.00 or less
           Taxes going to Big Brother: $2.50
              Royalties to the artist: $3.00 or less
         Royalties to BMG/SONY/VIRGIN: $12.00 or more.

That is an estimation, but it shows you how greedy the music companies 
are... we should only be paying about 1/2 of what we do for CD's and tapes.
Most people are too ignorant to realize this.. although there's not much
we can do about it except stop buying CD's.
    The focus of this article however is global markets.  So I would like 
to start off by bringing your attention to our nice little deal with US and
the Mexicans - NAFTA.  In case you don't know, this stands for 
North American Free Trade Agreement.  And essentially what it does is enable
large manufacturers to move plants down into mexico where labour is dirt cheap.
The old factories are either run at 1/2 the output (with 50% less employees)
or shutdown completely).  This is simplified to prove a point, and perhaps 
NAFTA was not originally meant to cause poverty.  But it has, and that makes
me doubt this fact.  Key questions are: "why would a company sell-out its
employees just for bigger profits?" and "How does the government let this
happen?"  The answer is up to you to find.
    When it comes to greed, all big companies know that the most profits
are gained when you have a monopoly on a market.  A monopoly means that only
one company is providing a product, and there is no competition to drive
down prices, and increase quality standards.  In our capitalist society today,
this kind of behaviour dominates.  Micro$oft is probably the epitome of this
negative action.  Microsoft is the bully of the software market, and if you
weren't aware of this, and still support Microsoft's inferior software, then
perhaps you should re-evaluate.  Microsoft's marketing scheme is extremely
aggressive and self-serving.  I'm all for making big profits, but this is
getting out of hand.  What Bill does is force retailers who want to be a
licensed microsoft vendor to put win95 on the new machines that they sell.
Microsoft crams its shitty software down their throats (retailers), and as a
result, they cram it down *our* throats, in order to make what little profit
they can to pay the bills.  This information is from a reliable source.
    Because this kind of behaviour is very bad for publicity, companies try
to hide it from you.  If you an ignorant zombie, you might perhaps not
believe anything I illustrate here.  Go fuck yourself.  To continue, I am
going to outline a couple of ideas that a lot of enlightened people believe
to be true.  Currently we are cutting down trees at a rate of something to
the order of one square kilometer per minute.  It is sickening.  If you have
ever driven past a "de-forested area" you will immediately feel death in the
air.  Logging companies are relentlessly slaughtering our earth's beautiful
forests.  The shocking thing is, we know of an alternative source for this
material, yet it is illegal to grow for industrial, and recreational purposes.
I am talking about Cannabis; Hemp; Marijuana.  Hemp is known to yield higher
gains for paper products than any tree.  Hemp grows annually, unlike trees
which take 40-100 years to mature.  And Hemp is cheaper and easier to grow.
Why then, are we not utilizing this wonderful plant?  The answer my friends
is because of a little word called 'greed'.  Let me explain, logging has been
a huge business over the course of the 20th century.  The companies are all
associates, and are all aware of the inevitable ban on de-forestation.  Of
course they don't want to go out of business.  These fat cats have been
living the good life their whole lives, and they do not want to give it up.
Now focus on the politician, who is going to vote yes or no to a bill that
will make hemp legal for industrial use.  It is in the interest of the
logging company to "buy" this guy's vote.  The politician is offered $25000
to vote 'no' to legalize hemp.  This situation happens so much more than you
know my comrades.  In almost *every* multi-million dollar industry,
kick-backs, bribes, and pay-offs are made every day.  The rules seem to be
different at a billion dollars.  It seems you are allowed to fuck with the
earth's precious balance for the promise of incredible profits.
    Another quick example of how this is occurring right now has to do with
the oil and car companies.  It appears there are serious repercussions in 
all this corruption.  Pollution threatens to take over our earth's atmosphere,
because of harmful smoke from factories, and also because of the oxides let
into the air by cars and trucks.  It seems to me, that this follows the
textbook case for an industrial scandal in order for continued profits.  There
is *no doubt in my mind* that a superior engine to the gasoline engine exists
that is cheaper to produce, requires cleaner fuel, and is available to produce
in mass-amounts for little or no change-over costs.  Unfortunately, these
incredible inventions have to get a patent before anything can be done.  I
believe that the oil companies buy these patents (through corrupt methods)
before any scientist has a chance to build a prototype, or attempt to
publicize their findings.  The oil companies then lock the blueprints up so
that they can continue to reap the profits they know and love.

EPILOGUE:
    I could continue on for pages with examples of how greed is starting to
seriously affect our society.  Big Brother (our gov't) is guilty of many
times choosing capital gain over the good of society.  You must find out for
yourself what is *really* going on in the world right now.  Get off your butt
and read a book, or call FoI and enlighten yourself.  Until more people 
become aware of this corruption, it will continue to happen.  Thank you for
taking the time to read this article, and the Damage, INC. Newsletter.

˙˙˙ƒƒƒ H/P NEWS ƒƒƒ˙˙˙

Unfortunately, there's not a tremendous amount of local h/p news to report
since nothing major has happened in 519.  However, we might publish news
from the 604 area code in the next issue.  - BLACKENED

I've just recently entered the h/p scene in 312 (Chicago)... and so far it
looks fairly promising.  Sure, there have been some busts in this area in
the past, but at the moment it seems rather stable and calm.  From what
BLACKENED told me the last time we spoke, 519 is in a hellish state... with
very little interest or excitement.  The 312 area code isn't nearly that bad,
although it is larger with more experienced people involved.  Thus far, I
have found a few good h/p boards to call and check out... and I'm enjoying
my stay here.  I actually found a few boards quickly by scanning.  :)

INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}
An interrogation of Billy Gates.

-B = BLACKENED
-G = Billy Gates
-L = Micro$oft lamers/lackies


Hello, Micro$oft.  This is BLACKENED of Damage, INC.  I'd like to do an       
interview with Billy Gates.  Is he available or is he going to dodge my       
questions again?  -B

Billy might be currently tied up ruining... I mean buying some other          
companies right now..  Let me check.  <pause>  I'll put you through...  -L

... Hello, this is Will.  -G

Hello there.  I was finally able to get through your lame security.  ;)  -B

Security? haha, I have no concept of what security is.  Just look at my
Operating systems.  -G

I meant, you have lackies screening your phone calls for you.  Why have you   
been trying to hide from Damage, INC. for years man?  All I want to do is ask 
a few simple questions... The future of Micro$oft will depend upon this       
interview.  So, be honest for once in your fucking life.  ;)  First, why did  
you ever release that piece of shit called Win95?  Was it done totally for    
quick profit?  -B

I resent that.  I believe windows 95 is the best product on the market right  
now.  If it has the Microsoft label, it's good old Microsoft quality.  Haha.  
I released it so that I could become the most hated man in the world.  I'm    
doing a good job don't you think? Would I put out an overrated operating      
system just for quick profit?  ... you bet your life i would.  -G

Hahaha.  Yes, of course you would.  Micro$oft and the word quality don't go
together man.  Windoze is completely bug ridden and an inferior operating     
system.  You know it, I know it, and the only people that don't are the       
Windoze zombies that buy the shit you peddle.  Next thing you know, you'll be 
trying to defend your shitty Win95 keyboards.  Haha.  Why hasn't Win98 been   
released yet?  Are your highly paid programmers still trying to fix up their  
Visual Basic code?  <laughing>  -B

Why you facetious little punk! Who the hell do you think you are?  Insulting  
my company, and my excellent, rayon coated keyboards.  
Zombies?  hahah, that's interesting, that's the word I used to describe that
in my marketing plan. <g>
I'm waiting to release win98, actually its been ready for months.  But I want 
to squeeze more money out of my first attempt at real multitasking.  -G

I'm your worst enemy Billy.  Now that you know who I am, I have a few more    
questions to ask you.  What companies are you planning on buying next?  Also, 
are you ever going to buy yourself a new shirt and tie, or an expensive suit?
Or are you that cheap that you want to hoard your $40 billion dollars... Most
people that I associate with call you a greedy bastard.
Do you realize that?  -B

A greedy bastard?  Geez, nobody's ever called me that before... <sob>.  So I  
am worth more than Cuba.  That's greedy?  I thought I was being generous.   
You say I wear cheap clothes?  Thats' because I'm a four-eyed nerd, who       
doesn't have an inkling of social acceptance, or moral conscience.  Does that 
answer your question?  
You think I would tell you what companies I'm buying next?  
...actually I don't even know myself - I have a big wheel that I spin, and    
the space it lands on corresponds to a business that becomes part of          
Microsoft that day.  hahahah <evil laugh>  -G

That doesn't surprise me at all.  I agree, you're the biggest geek/lamer      
around.  Yeah, you do wear cheap clothes.  You should also consider buying
a new pair of glasses.  Hahaha.  As for the companies that you'll buy next,
I'm sure you have secret plans to buy out Intel and have a monopoly on the    
hardware industry... to go along with your software monopoly.  You're a very
lucky man in some respects Billy.  IBM really gave you a good start back in   
the 1980's.  You have them to thank for your wealth... but I'm sure your ego
forces you to credit yourself with building Micro$oft.  I just hope the U.S.
Government fines the hell out of you!  Hahaha.  -B

FUCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!  THEY'LL NEVER GET MY MONEY.  NEVER.  
..AND NEVER *EVER* SAY 'IBM' IN MY PRESENCE AGAIN.  SPIT, SPIT.  -G

The rest of the words were too big for me to understand...  -G

After the sweet deal IBM gave you back then, I'm surprised at your hatred for 
them.  Of course, your deal with Apple soured a little bit too.  Is that a    
soft spot that I detect?  You don't like any other companies besides your     
own, do you?  Haha.  As for the U.S. Government, they're doing what is right  
for once... in attempting to stop you from dominating and controlling the     
world.  Just as, hackers do their part to destroy your little, shitty         
network.  <BFG>  -B

I have no idea what you're talking about.   I have no plans to dominate the   
world.  Maybe North-America.  Shit, oops, that's off the record.  Don't print
that okay?
No I don't like competition.  Capitalism is a full-scale war, and I'm         
winning.  Why would i want to stop? Death is symbolized in takeovers, and I   
have killed thousands.  Those who try to battle with Microsoft will feel the  
iron fist of the most influential fighter strike them down as if they were    
flies.  No one can stop me, no-one can stop me now.  -G

Damage, INC. doesn't make deals with lamers Billy... and you more than        
qualify for the lamer category.  Haha.  Someone will stop you.  Damage, INC.
will continue to inform people about you and Micro$oft.  You influence the
ignorant zombies and prey upon their lack of knowledge to sell inferior       
products.  Without them buying your shitty software, you'd be nothing man!
You've tainted the word capitalism... and sicken me.  Of course you don't     
know what I'm talking about.  You pretend to be coy, meanwhile you're         
probably planning your attack on the rest of the software market as we speak.
I speak for millions of people when I say, Fuck You!  We'll do everything
in our power to stop you... and your corrupt, greedy, underhanded company.
You can't influence the intelligent Gates.  That's why you'll never defeat
us.  -B

What's your name again?  Blackened.  You are absolutely right there Blackened.
But I am smart because I know that the people you talk about only represent
1% of the population.  The government thinks they can try and stop me by      
fining me.  Haha.  I make a million dollars a day in interest.  I am a man    
who lives with no emotions.  My wife and I sleep in separate beds, and when
we have sex, well, we never have sex, as my pecker's too small.  You may      
think you know everything Mr. Blackened, but my only weakness is my greed.    
Try and find a way to exploit that.  Tell me why I should be scared of        
Damage, INC.  -G

I'll never install any version of Windoze.  That's one thing I *do* know Mr.  
Billy Gates.  Sure, I only represent a very small portion of the population,
but the Damage, INC. Newsletter will be distributed world wide... and you
*will* be exposed.  Everyone will know that you're a corrupt bastard that
thrives on greed... after they read the next issue!  Hahaha.  Stick that in   
your pipe and smoke it Billy!  Actually, that's a good idea.  Try smoking a   
little weed sometime and calm down... As for exploiting that, if there's a 
way to destroy Micro$oft, we'll find it.  That's a promise man.  I don't
want to hear about you and the pathetic situation with your wife... All that
tells me is that you aren't a man, but a fucking geek that lives for money.
Do you sit in a big leather chair behind your desk and look at your bank      
books and investments every night like a fat cat while others do your dirty
work for you?  -B

Actually my chair is zombie-hide.  And I have a nice big 50" monitor that     
updates me every second of how much money I make.  Did you know I make over   
$100 000 a second? muahahahah. 
What's this Newsletter?  fuck it, its no match for my team of skilled         
investigators.  We will find and destroy Damage, INC.  But you can't tell     
them all.  -G

<SH>  I'm shaking my head at you Gates.  As if I'd give you any information
about the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Let's see if your paid lackies can stop
us.  Haha.  Check your Caller ID... I'm calling Micro$hit from your home
phone number d00d... Hehe... <sinister snicker>  ;)  -B

??? - "Hey Sergio, go look at the call-display, NOW." ...  -G
      "Yassir, ze nomber eez 555-GEEK.. eetz your hom phon nomber."  -L
      "How the hell??... quick call security."  -G

I don't know who you are Mr. Blackened, but don't play games with me.  I      
don't know what you're up to.  I'm losing faith in my excellent team of       
security guards.  What are you trying to prove here you big bully?  -G

Haha.  You don't fucking know anything Billy... ;)  I'm not playing games,
this is war... as you said earlier.  I will do whatever is necessary to
make you pay.  Speaking of making you pay, I *really* appreciate you allowing 
me to use your phone line.  In return, you will get an early Christmas        
present when you receive your phone bill... Hahahaha!  Thanks again.  I       
enjoyed beige boxing for the past few days and calling all over the world
while you were at Micro$oft wheeling and dealing.  I've only just begun       
though man.  You ain't seen nothin' yet fucker!  CLICK!  -B

..."hello, hello?".  Fucker must be lying, those "beige-boxes" only work in   
the movies.  <click> ;)  -G

Hate to bug you on a day like today but I just read the newest damage
newsletter release, and enjoyed it. Very comical, informative and
inspirational ;)

I was just wondering (since I'm a newbie scum or whatever) if you could refer
me to some information philes (<-cheap reference) on getting started. I know
nothing about programming, assembly, boxes, etc... and It would be nice If I
could get my hands on something that puts it all in perspective.

No prompt reply necessary, but if you could assist me in any way, I'd
appreciate it. Also, while I've thought about it, If you know of any books in
the library (I live in Guelph) that could help put this in perspective, or
even how to learn programming (borland, c++, etc..) I would appreciate a few
references. Thanx,

    Army Boy, alias Sir_Autechre.

P.s. I must say again that the damage newsletter 002 was Excellent! Right on,
keep it coming!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor - I'm thankful that you wrote that message man since I enjoy receiving
         feedback.  We're all glad that you enjoyed the last issue of the
         Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Also, everyone was a newbie at one time or
         another, but that doesn't mean we think you're scum man.  ;)  We can
         only judge you upon how you act, your attitude and willingness to
         learn about h/p.  You've already taken the first step towards learning
         more...and thus far you seem to be respectful and eager to learn more.

         Read the H/P Information and News section.  I've included a list of
         necessary files to download and read.  They'll assist you in learning
         the basics of h/p, unix etc.  You should also get a copy of ToneLoc,
         Turbo Assembler and the other programs and utilities that I listed.
         As for information on boxes, there is a vast amount available on AJFA
         and FoI.  If you are serious about wanting to learn how to program in
         assembly, contact me via Email.  I don't program in C++ though, so
         I cannot refer you to any good books for that language.  Thanks again
         for the feedback and compliments.  ;)


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
The Media - Mistakes or Misinformation?

The media is a sickness.  They are quick to spread misinformation to the
masses (of zombies)... and they know that it'll be believed by them without
question.  Every once in a while, they make a major mistake and have to
retract their comments.  In a feeble attempt to take back their words, they
print a very small article on page 38 (just as an example), and admit that
what they previously wrote was incorrect.  However, by that time the damage
has already been done by the media... and innocent people's lives have been
permanently affected.  Thus far, it might sound like I'm being overly harsh
and not objective with my opinion on the media.  Perhaps you're thinking or
assuming that I have nothing to base my statements on.  If that's the case,
you are mistaken.  There are plenty of incidents in the media that I'm using
to base my opinion on... as proof to show you that they "aren't always right".
The media jumps to conclusions, wrongly accuses innocent people, makes huge
assumptions and prints stories (including rumours) submitted by unreliable
sources.  Plus, they never want to reveal their sources to anyone... even
after the information has been proven to be false.

Take the Richard Jewel story as one example of the mass media destroying
someone's reputation and life.  His very name will forever be associated
with the "Olympic Park Bombing"... even though he's an innocent man.  People
still believe that he's guilty.  He's been confronted in public places,
heckled, threatened etc.  Who's at fault?  The media.  Why should the media
be held responsible for what has happened to Richard Jewel?  A small newspaper
in Atlanta wrote a story, naming him as the prime suspect for the Olympic Park
bombing (right after he'd been called a hero by the press for trying to clear
people away from the sound stage tower).  Then, the mass media jumped on the
story... and thus a "media frenzy" was created.  Almost instantly, it was a
national story on TV, the radio and in every major newspaper.  Suddenly, the
name Richard Jewel was a household name... and people were calling him an
evil man, a sick terrorist etc.  Obviously, the zombies (citizens that believe
whatever the media tells them) couldn't talk enough about the story.  They
were fascinated by it.  Yet, did any of them even consider for a second that
he *might* be innocent and wrongly accused?  Did they go by the facts and
evidence or rumours and speculation?  Basically, they just condemned him before
he was even formally charged with committing any crime.  Is that justice?  I
think not.  Was it a mistake by the media?  Again, I think not.

The mass media spreads misinformation on a daily basis.  Sure, that's a bold
statement to make... but it is true.  They don't always check the facts first
before printing an article on someone and making false accusations against them.
Just as, the media enjoys stories that get people talking and last for long
periods of time.  There have been several public court cases in recent years
that I could draw upon as examples, but I'm sure you know what the "big, fat,
juicy, money making stories" were.  I'll just use one example, the infamous
Unabomber case.  Afterall, it's still making the headlines and the press hasn't
quite lost interest in it... yet.  As a result of the media coverage, I don't
think Theodore Kazinski will be granted a fair trial.  If you disagree and
honestly believe he will have a fair trial by untainted jurors that have no
bias against him... then perhaps you should consider the influence that the
media has upon the average citizen.  Almost everyone has been exposed to and
assaulted by the media barrage of coverage on the Unabomber.  Sure, they try
to use words like "suspected Unabomber" etc. when speaking about Kazinski...
but in reality aren't they trying him in the press before he receives a trial
in court?  Is it innocent until proven guilty or guilty until proven innocent?
That is something that you'll have to decide for yourselves.  What about the
headlines that declared the Unabomber was caught and arrested after an
exhaustive 17 year FBI man hunt?  Was that just a mistake?  Or was that the
media trying to mislead people with misinformation again?

In summary, the media should answer to someone.  They aren't "all knowing" and
"all powerful".  They sure love to write stories and profit but don't enjoy
answering any questions.  Also, the media was hesitant to print the Unabomber's
Manifesto...yet they were quick to take credit when Kazinski was arrested.  In
fact, they were even patting themselves on the back and claimed the arrest was a
direct result of publishing the Unabomber's words.  Meanwhile, many people on
this earth have a similar writing style, vocabulary etc.  Only now are they
starting to reveal some of the actual evidence that was found in Kazinski's
Montana cabin.  I urge people not to judge someone before they have been
convicted.  Don't base your opinions solely on media propaganda you've read,
seen or heard.  Make a conscious effort to become informed.  Question what you
are told to believe.  Use your own mind to think, instead of allowing the
media to think for you.

            including email and computer-to-computer communications. Law
            enforcement must get a warrant in order to access the contents
            of your message. Whether law enforcement can get access to the
            contents of your email is largely dependent on the email
            retention policy of your service provider. For example, if the
            policy of your service is to only retain the email header once
            you've read your email, then law enforcement will not have
            access to read the contents of your email.

Personally Identifiable Transactional Data

            The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994
            (commonly known as the Digital Telephony Act) amended ECPA,
            increasing the privacy protection for online transactional
            information. The law now includes a heightened standard for law
            enforcement access to transactional data generated by
            electronic communications services. Instead of a mere subpoena,
            law enforcement officials must obtain a court order based on
            "specific and articulable facts" that such records are
            "relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation"
            (sec 207 (a)(2)).

Subscription Information

            Under the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of
            1994 (commonly known as the Digital Telephony Act), access to
            subscription information requires an administrative subpoena.
            This is a less privacy-protective standard than the standards
            governing law enforcement access to the contents of your
            communication or personally indentifiable transactional
            information.

THE JOURNALIST'S TOP TEN LIST -                                   {TOP TEN}
"Top Ten pranks on the Internet:"

    0. E-Mail Bombing.  This is a fun one to pull if some asshole on IRC
       or USENET is pissing you off.  Basically you get hold of either 
       a win95 app, or some source code that is designed to "mail-bomb"
       an address.  What it will do is send up to 100,000 e-mails to
       your target, and the victim will have to go through and delete each
       one ;)  One glitch i have heard of is if you do this to a gov't site
       they have "email bouncers" setup, so that every email you send to
       that address is sent back to you.  If this was the case, you would
       essentially be e-bombing yourself! ;)

    1. Sniffer Programs.  For this you need to have access to a shell 
       account on your local ISP.  MGL, Hookup, Sentex all provide shell
       access.  Golden Triangle does not however.  If you happen to have
       shell, you can run something called a "sniffer program."  What this
       does is reside in memory, and captures all logins and passwords.
       It is really that easy!  Once you have these, you can use any account
       you wish.  You can hack, email-bomb from that account, *without 
       getting charged any hourly rates*.  Sniffer Programs can be found on 
       Freedom of Information Archives.

    2. Webpage Hacking.  This is a lot quicker if you have obtained accounts
       using the above method.  Essentially you have to obtain root on the
       system that the webpage resides on.  Then you can modify homepages
       to make them fucked up.  Fatal Vision told me the "Hackers" movie
       webpage was hacked, and changed to be hilarious.  There are many
       ways to obtain root on the remote system, so I will not go into the
       methods.  To find the homepage, use cd /home/"name"/public_html or
       something similar.  It will be a directory residing in the user's
       home directory.. (type home to see where that is).

    3. Socket Killing.  Hehehaha.. this is probably the most fun.  
       If there's a user on the net that is giving you lip, and 
       intentionally pissing you off, with a program called WINNUKE, you
       can kick them off the net!  It is a win95 Util that takes advantage
       of one of the many glitches in the PPP code of win95.  The util
       sends a continual denial-of-service message to the victim, and win95
       crashes horribly at this.  Not only will you be killing his internet
       connection, but crashing his win95 every time.  This is much more 
       effective if you write a script that executes WINNUKE everytime
       the d00d logs in to his ISP.  He will think it is something wrong
       with his computer/modem/software, and it will cause him/her a *lot*
       of hassle. ;)

    4. IRC Bots.  I'm sure a lot of people know what these are, but they
       are always a good prank, provided you can find an IRC server that 
       will allow you to run them.  The amount of pranks you can pull with
       BOTS is amazing!  You can control a dedicated channel and only let
       in certain people.  Or you can wreak havoc on other channels by
       automating a script, making it resident, and then logging out.  The
       BOT keeps running even if you're not logged on, and only stops if 
       another BOT is clever enough to boot it, or if the sysAdmn sees it
       and decides to remove it.  These are just brief explanations, and
       would have to be read-up on before trying! ;)

    5. Porno E-mailing.  This one is not quite as well known, but I think
       is the ultimate prank.  Your mark has to be a reserved, dignified
       arsehole.  You may want to use a fake return address for this, 
       (or a hacked account) but go on the net and find the raunchiest XXX 
       pics you can find (disgusting looking old women etc.), and e-mail them
       to your victim.  I'm pretty sure you can email a .JPG and it will
       come up on his screen.  I would love to see his face if he had people
       looking at his screen when he happened to read his email. <g>
       You could also leave captions such as "The night you were conceived"
       and other friendly comments like that.. haha

    6. AOL Pranks.  These major services, mainly AOL are largely responsible
       for the sorry state of the internet today.  Their mass-marketing 
       served only to lower the quality of the newsgroups, and increase
       the profits of AOL.  These assholes need to be avenged.  
       There is a program on h/p boards (refer to EOF) called AOLHELL.  
       I won't even go into what one can do with this, except to say that
       it is worth checking out.  I'm not sure if AOL has combatted the 
       methods used by AOLHELL, but I'm sure there are still some holes in
       their interface.

    7. Chain Letters.  Everyone's seen these, all over USENET, all the 
       time.  You can't read 10 message without one of them being a "get
       rich quick" scheme.  I was always very pissed off at this, and then
       I figured a way to get revenge.  (And possibly some cash).  
       Get the addresses of the people in the letter.  You know they are
       susceptible to the idea of fast-money.  This is their downfall, 
       and your advantage.  Email each one of the people, telling them
       of some lottery they've won, or of some "super-chain-letter" that 
       promises 10 times the amount of the one they were on.  You have 
       to catch their eye, and entice their interest.  Make up shit, make
       up phoney documents, claiming to be a legitimate fund-raising co.
       What I would do is setup a Mail Box at somewhere like Shopper's 
       Drug Mart, and tell the people to send money to it.  You never know
       if it will work until you try it boys and girls...

    8. Carding is making a comeback due to the anonymity guaranteed by 
       the internet.  With a hacked account, you are omnipotent, untouchable
       and you can use this to make money.  (or get stuff).  If you know 
       how to get credit card #'s then you can skip this, but if not, there
       are a few ways to quickly get somebody else's info. (exp. date, and
       card #).  The first is to go "trashing."  go through the garbage of
       some retail outlets that might leave papers in there with interesting
       info on them.  Alternatively, if you are clever with hacking, you 
       could scan all packets leaving and entering a site that is commonly
       used for purchasing things.  If they have online VISA charging, I am
       guessing you could watch what information goes into and out of the 
       server.  The web page cannot decrypt the CC# before it gets there, 
       so there is a time lag where there are millions of Credit-Card #'s 
       floating around in cyberspace.  The other way to get Credit Card #'s
       is to simply steal them if you work at a place where people pay with
       credit card.  Its a lot easier if you haven't seen the face of the
       person whose card it is you're using though.  
           Once you have the necessary info, you can pretty much
       order anything you want.  Software, Porno Passwords, etc.  Don't
       get *anything* mailed to your house.  But software can usually be
       emailed to your box, so no-one has a chance of knowing who did it.

    9. I.P. Spoofing.  This is an advanced topic, so I will make it 
       simple.  One, you have to have a shell account to do this.  Two
       you must have a basic knowledge of how Unix/TCP_IP works.  
       This is a method of hacking to obtain root access on a remote 
       server.  There are many reasons why you might want to do this, most
       of the common ones are covered in this list however.  
       You need to d/l source code for an IP Spoofing program - yes the 
       hard work has already been done for you.  Run the code from your
       shell, and wait until you get access.  I would recommend going 
       through and deleting any logs that might incriminate you.

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Disturbing Closing Comments:

I'm disappointed with the lack of feedback and letters to the editor.  We were
expecting more readers to send us quality, insightful comments and suggestions.
At this point, I would be actually grateful to receive hate mail to publish
and reply to.  The Damage, INC. Newsletter has generated some interest in h/p
in 519... but hasn't had the type of impact that we'd hoped.  The main problem
lies in the people that are "involved" in the local h/p scene.  (and I'm being
generous by using the word involved).  I realize there aren't many people in
this area with a tremendous amount of h/p experience and knowledge.  I've even
publicly stated that we have nothing against newbies, and are willing to help
those with a legitimate desire to start learning, experimenting and putting
the information that they've given into practice by becoming active in the h/p
scene... and trying to do a few things.  Thus, the majority of this issue was
dedicated to teach newbies and refer them to the essentials for beginners.

Other than that, we cannot do everything for you.  It is your responsibility
to take the initiative, become dedicated and self-taught.  That's not only how
it is, but how it has always been.  Reading h/p text files is only a small
portion of the learning process.  It'll only take you so far.  If you want to
limit yourself to that, you won't ever progress and achieve anything.  However,
if you really want to become involved and contribute, let us know.

We are also planning to distribute the Damage, INC. Newsletter to other area
codes very soon.  It's possible that there will be a Damage, INC. Distribution
Site in British Columbia before January 1998.  ;)

We're still looking for Writers, Members and Distribution Sites.  If you'd like
to apply to Damage, INC. and join a respected h/p group, then download a copy of
the Damage, INC. Application Generator.  If you want any of our releases, they
are currently available on the following boards:

...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL - Damage, INC. WHQ, h/p/a/c/v/t, no ratios, invite only.
Freedom of Information Archives - Damage, INC. Dist. Site, h/p/a/c/v/t.
Distraught Continuum - h/p/a/c/v/t, programming, etc.

Any feedback or letters to the editor should be sent to BLACKENED in Email on
a Damage, INC. board near you.
