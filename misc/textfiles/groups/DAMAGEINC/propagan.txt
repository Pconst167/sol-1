Propagandize.

I'll give ya the low down...
We're takin' it to the streets.
Puttin' the power back in the hands of the p33ps.

You know what I'm talkin' about?
You know what I'm sayin'?
Now it's time to get serious.  Time you all quit playin'.

I'll give ya the straight facts.
So we can bring it all back.
Better act now so we can get on fucking track.

Get your act together.
And quit hittin' that pipe so hard.
Yer mind is all you've got left.  Last card.

I'm tellin' ya not to just sit back.
Don't just react.
Get up.  Ya gotta go on the attack.

Power to the people.  Ya hear me?
Fuck man, don't phear me.
You gotta listen to this.  Open yer eyes and see.

This ain't no showdown.  I'm givin' you the low down.
Dude don't let em mess you up.
Fuck your mind and make you all soft like a pup.

You gettin' any of this shit?
You ain't down?
Fuck partner... you better step out and split town.

This ain't all that hard to get.
So don't sit there bein' a fuckin punk.
This shit's as easy as seizin' a trunk.

Big Bro will fuck yer mind with propaganda.
He'll hit ya hard with it below the belt in the junk.
So you better prepare or yer ass will be missin' a phat chunk.

You gonna just stand there like a chump?
He's bringin' this shit right in yer face...
Beaming fuckin' Sat messages down all over the place.

It's a disgrace.  You gonna take that shit?
You gonna believe the propaganda from space?
Don't just front.  Yer already losin' this race.

It's fuckin' you up.  Man, if only you knew.
Get off yer fuckin' ass and start doin' somethin' bout it.
Or you already brainwashed by this shit?

It's all goin' down now.  Ya dig?
All this shit is gettin' worse man.  Final chance.
No more playin'.  Run like a punk or dance.

This is the last fuckin' shot.
Brotha it's now or never.  You gotta fight or die.
I ain't gonna lie.

Do whatever the fuck ya want.
I can't tell ya what to do.  You gotta choose.
I'll say this though... You back up and you lose.

If yer runnin' for back already, you just wait.
Roll over and die.  You'll soon be 0wned.
Don't think I havta tell ya.  You'll soon be shown.

Bought and sold.  Influenced like all hell.
It's do or die time.  It's all on the line now.
What?  I gotta fuckin' show you what to do and how?
