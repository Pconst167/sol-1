BLACKENED's group of telecommunications enthusiasts have been creating 
telephone scanning lists, newsletters, and poetry since 1993. This collection
comes courtesy of his efforts, which are greatly appreciated. 
A large portion of these files are the Damage, Inc. Newsletter, which pulls
away any individal textfiles they might be working on and puts them into an
easy to find (and read) collection. Solid telephone information and great
to see them at it after so many years.
