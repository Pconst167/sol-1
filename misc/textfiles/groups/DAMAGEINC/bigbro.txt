Big Brother Matters.

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't tear much more lives apart
Forever changing who you are
And we're all that matters.

Never exploited your mind this way
Life is ours, you live it our way
Bow down on your knees when I say
And the establishment matters.

Followers I seek and I find in you
Every day for us wealth renewed
Close your minds for a different view
And Big Brother matters.

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But we know.

So ours, no matter how far
Couldn't steal much more from your heart
Forever creating who you are
And the NWO matters.

Never cared for what you do             | Never cared for what zombies do
Never cared for what you know           | Never cared for what zombies know
But we know.                            | But we know

Never exploited so many minds this way  | Never destroyed so many minds this way
Your life is ours, you live it our way  | You're ours, you live life our way
All these words we don't just say.      | Your only duty is to obey

Zombies I seek and I find in you        | Naive minds I seek and I find in you
Every day we control something new      | Every day for us abusing you
Close your minds for a different view   | Fuck your minds for a different view
And the WTO matters.                    | And Big Brother matters.

Never cared for what zombies say        | Never cared for what slaves say
Never cared for games they play         | Never cared how much they pay
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And we know.

So owned, no matter how far             | So fucked, no matter how far
Couldn't take much more from your heart | Couldn't rip much more from your heart
Forever raping who you are              | Forever changing who you are
No nothing else matters.                | No you don't matter.

Notes:  This is a song modelled after Metallica's "Nothing Else Matters".
Obviously, I've modified the lyrics significantly.  But that's the style it
has been written in.  Music inspires.  I've included alternate (alternative?)
lyrics for some of the stanzas and marked them beside.  It was written in a
very short amount of time, but I still think it's cool and carries meaning.
