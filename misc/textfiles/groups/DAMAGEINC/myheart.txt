My Heart Beats for You.

On bent knees, I feel you.
Gentle caresses that soothe true.

In through a door you appear out of nowhere like a burst of energy.
Without facades or pretensions.  You are just who you must be.

Melodic molecules and electrons whirling around.
You are here now and I can feel you... free and unbound.

Unrestrained forces across windswept fields and horizons.
Universal theories, planets of thought and a thousand blazing suns.

Gone is the common shallowness as you make things deep.
So real I don't want you to leave.  Yet I know sometime you must sleep.

Drifting.  Thoughts of friends and love and home.
Mind at ease.  Kindness and understanding and the things you've shown.

Wrapped in warmth.  Embraced by comfort.  Fading fast.
Relax held in arms of compassion.  Hush now.  And rest.

Sleep now dear.

Sleep through blizzards of snow.
Sleep through hail and falling water.
Sleep through disappointment and heartbreak.
Sleep through winters of discontent.
Sleep through angels singing that were heaven sent.
Sleep through wicked sky and cold of night.
Sleep through space and time, darkness and light.
Sleep through dreams of wind whispering in your ear.
Sleep through it all in sweetness, with not a disturbing sound to hear.
Sleep through the silence too.
Sleep through the wind outside as it howls and whines and cries.

Then rise.

Rise like a fiery star over snow capped mountains, licking at them and
warming the valleys below.
Rise like the soft rolling hills, green and lush.
Rise above ashes and cold frozen earth.
Rise like the pitch of beautiful music, soothing and serene.
Rise like the sea on warm sand, calm aqua blue and clean.
Rise refreshed like the crisp fall air.
Rise and feel solace that you've vanquished all despair.
Rise like an indian summer and bask in the glow.
Rise and greet the world smiling, with your gifts to bestow.
Rise engulfed by flame of renewal and contentment.
Rise to awaken and ensure your passion never dies.

And through it all, your beauty remains.

- Dedicated to Megs.  You inspire me.  This lullaby was written for you, so
that you may read these words and sleep.  But you've inspired much more than
just these words.  I know we'll always be friends.  And I'm so very grateful
to have found you.  You're a very sweet, passionate, beautiful person.  ;)
The title may not mean anything to someone else reading this, but you know the
