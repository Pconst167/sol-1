INTRODUCTION:  Welcome to another issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  The
               quote for this issue "Phun for h/p d00ds" is obviously meant
               as a joke.  So, lighten up all of you big l33t hax0r d00ds.  ;)
               No offense is intended to those that consider themselves to be
               l33t hax0rs, and feel insulted by my comment.  Haha.

               Onward... Have you ever thought about mind over matter?  As in,
               telekinesis?  What about, mind over time?  Or perhaps, mind over
               mind?  Do you ever think about the potential power that our
               minds might hold?  Have you ever wondered about how far thoughts
               can travel?  Is it possible that our minds can go beyond the
               limits of space and time?  My main point is that possibilities
               exist that should be explored.  As a race, there are still many
               questions that we don't know the answer to, or cannot explain.
               However, that doesn't prevent us from continuing to learn more,
               progress and find the answers.  Meaning, don't dismiss something
               and assume that it's impossible because you don't understand it
               or can't explain it.  Open your mind.  Become aware of the things
               that science avoids investigating.  Seek out the truth.  Try to
               find your own answers.  Rely on yourself, and not what you are
               told to believe.  Think about the unthinkable.  Consider all of
               the alternative, strange perspectives.  Don't just conform and
               take "society's" mainstream point of view for everything.
               Develop your own individual beliefs and opinions.  Destroy the
               barriers of thinking that are hidden deep within your mind.

               At this stage, you may be wondering how this relates to this
               issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.  I'll attempt to clarify
               and explain the reason I wrote the above paragraph as part of
               the Introduction.  I want our readers to expand their minds,
               think about possibilities, consider alternatives, strengthen and
               improve their level of knowledge.  Why?  Well, think logically.
               If you manage to do that, you will be able to learn vast amounts
               of new information, evolve as a person, and advance.  The mere
               capacity to learn doesn't necessarily mean that someone *will*
               start learning.  Therefore, it takes more than being interested
               to learn about hacking and phreaking.  You must think.  In order
               to think freely, you must clear your mind and remove its useless
               limitations, misconceptions, lies and stereotypes.

               The expression "I think therefore I am" can be modified to read
               "I think therefore I hack/phreak" without destroying the meaning.
               Hopefully you understand why that saying is just as valid as
               the first.  In reality, it hasn't actually been changed.

               We are creatures that are capable of pondering our own existence.
               Even though we are animals, we can create and use technology.
               Personally, I don't believe that we are the only "intelligent
               lifeforms" in the universe but at least on this planet our
               intellect is unmatched.  The human brain has been developing for
               millennia.  It's the greatest piece of technology of all.  Don't
               waste its power.  I suggest that you use your mind and use
               technology to your own advantage.  My definition of h/p is
               thinking.  You can form your own opinions and try to define it
               differently, but I challenge you to dispute "h/p is thinking"
               and find a way to disprove that statement.  Its simplicity is
               what makes it complex and meaningful.  Unfortunately, to many
               h/p only means "hacking/phreaking".  For me, it carries a much
               greater meaning.


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Censorship:  Big Brother's secret weapon:

How many works of art, songs, movies and books have been destroyed by
censorship?  Obviously, there's no way to provide accurate statistics to
show how widespread censorship is.  But censorship can be found everywhere.
I'm sure that you've personally encountered censorship, and experienced how
it totally degrades and ruins the censored item in question.  The censorship
machine keeps on rolling.  Its momentum is created by the weak minded zombies
that protest if they disagree with the content of something.  If they find a
school book to be offensive, they get people to sign a petition, call the
school board etc. until it's banned reading material.  That just robs students
from being able to read classic books that would benefit them intellectually.
It shelters and censors them from seeing the real world, as it really is.

Have you ever wondered why there's so much censorship?  The reason is that
many people *want* to be censored, thus forcing it on everyone else.  That just
gives government agencies power.  It also gives them an excuse.  Big Brother
loves being able to say that a song or movie is "below community standards".
What does that actually mean?  Well, it simply means that people (sometimes a
very small number) call or send letters to an agency, such as the CRTC in
Canada and say that they find something offensive.  However, they have choices
available to them.  If they are offended by a TV show or movie, they can change
the channel.  If it's a song on the radio, they can listen to another station
etc.  That isn't what they want to do though.  They want to make sure that
*nobody* else can watch, read or listen to something unless it's censored.
So, they run to Big Brother for assistance.  And of course, Big Brother is
there to "help" them by making sure it becomes censored or banned material.

Why does Big Brother enjoy censoring and banning various material?  It's their
secret weapon.  It gives them control over us.  Each time they are allowed to
censor something (with public support and excuses) they gain a little more
control over what we have access to.  Using censorship as a weapon makes
Big Brother feel strong and powerful.  Censorship in the hands of Big Brother
is a very subtle and effective weapon.  It's one of their favourite mind control
techniques.  As in, they limit what type of information is absorbed into our
minds and therefore maintain control.  That's the very reason that mainstream
publications and movies are so shallow and lack aggressive, raw opinions etc.
They've been censored to prevent anything deemed "too offensive" from being
included.  It's sickening.  If you've ever watched movies shown on television
then you already know exactly what I'm talking about.  Words are removed, entire
scenes are cut from the movie and it's altered so much that the actual movie is
almost completely unrecognizable.  That's why censorship is so harmful.  Why
should Big Brother be allowed to modify someone else's work at will?  In my
opinion, they shouldn't.  It isn't their creation and doesn't belong to them.

In closing, nothing should be censored...but obviously countless things are.
There's no easy solution.  There is no quick fix.  There is no advice that
I can give you to fight this problem that is corroding away at our creative
works.  The only advice that I can give you concerning censorship is to avoid
supporting any medium that supports it.  That simply means, read uncensored,
underground publications whenever you can get access to them.  Seek out
book stores that sell books that are banned elsewhere.  Listen to music that
doesn't have words "beeped out" whenever possible.  Look for information on
the internet regarding censorship, and learn how it can personally affect you.
You can also find underground magazines, text files etc. on internet sites.
Use it as an instrument and utilize its resources.  You might be amazed at some
of the material available that Big Brother doesn't want you to have access to
or know about.  Don't let them stop you from accessing *any* information.

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
List of h/p sites and how to find them:

Q:  How can I find some h/p sites?

A:  Look at the list of sites below.  Many of them have links to other sites.
    Download lists of h/p sites.  Write down the ones that are written in
    h/p magazines that you read.  Try using search engines (like Altavista etc.)
    Do a search for hack, phreak, virus, security, unix, underground, exploits,
    cryptology etc.  That should give you a nice list of sites to check out.
    Then try to find the specific sites that you want to visit by narrowing down
    the search.  (Examples:  Phrack or cDc to find their sites).

Internet www and ftp sites are unpredictable.  Some of them are very unreliable
in that they're up one week and down the next.  Therefore, some of the sites in
the following list might not exist anymore... even though we've done our best
to personally check as many as possible.  Also, they aren't all h/p sites.
There are some sites like Sun, AT&T, Cryptology, Privacy, Anonymous Email etc.
as well that might be of interest to you.  If you know of any good h/p boards
(dialups/telnet) from any area code, then make a list and send it to us.  We
want to create a large h/p bbs list and include it in a future issue.

CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
PSYCHIC WARRIOR:

    Keeping with the theme of this month's newsletter, this article reveals
the US Government's coverup of a secretive group of people, whose daily
activities are mind boggling, and bone chilling.
    Operating under the codename STARGATE, in the Defense-Intelligence
Division, members of this group practiced things that less than 1% of the
US Government, CIA, and FBI knew about.  One thing that can be learned from
this somewhat chilling tale, is that most of the time, most of the army has
no idea what the rest of the army is up to.  The dawning of the 60's produced
an era of defense officials never before seen in the army;  intelligence had
taken over brute force methods of attack, and now new, more intricate plans
of attack were being concocted.  This article describes one of those such
"new age" plans.
    Sergeant David Morehouse was just your average joe.  He had pursued a
career in the armed forces, as had his dad, and his.  He had a lovely wife,
and two healthy children.  For some reason though, David's path was "chosen"
for him.  Whether you believe in fate or not is entirely up to you, but this
man's life changed so drastically that I myself cannot believe it was
accidental, or "coincidence."  The year was 1979; Morehouse and his platoon
"The Rangers" were stationed in a remote East-European country, training
Palestinian soldiers about war techniques.  Nothing was out of the ordinary,
until one day on a routine village raid, a stray bullet struck Morehouse
square on the forehead.  Instantly he was transported into another realm.
What he describes as "angels" (simply an archetypal symbol IMO), visited him
and gave him the message "What you are doing is wrong.  If you want peace,
seek peace, practice peace.  You have seen death, now bring life."  In one
instant his life as he knew it had changed.  The bullet had luckily hit his
helmet, and not done any severe physical damage.  The psychological damage
though, was shattering.  For years after the incident he was plagued with
nightmares, "visitings", visions, voices, and other bizarre experiences such
as sleepwalking, spontaneous trances, and more.
    David battled with the experience.  The main focus of his life had become
how to deal with the newfound consciousness.  It was as if the bullet hitting
his helmet had opened up some sort of blackhole in the fabric of space-time,
and consciousness.  He hoped with time it would go away.  It did not;  but
instead got worse.  Maybe a change was needed.  He decided to switch divisions,
into the intelligence-agency despite warnings from Commanding Officers that
"what goes on in there is sick, and immoral."  Before being allowed into the
Defense-Intelligence-Agency (DIA) Morehouse was required to undergo numerous
physical and mental tests.  Using these, the army built a "psychological
profile" on the new recruit, standard procedure for the DIA.  The army now
knew more about David Morehouse than he knew about himself.  They would later
use this to their advantage.
    Based upon his bizarre experience, our plagued hero was placed in a
covert operation now known as the STARGATE project.  Knowledge of its
existence was limited to very few individuals.  Morehouse was asked to lie to
his wife and family; no one was to know about what went on during the long
days he was at work.  Members of this unit were trained to develop psychic
abilities to be used in the application of defense-intelligence.  Another 
thing that can be learned from this man's experience is that the psychic
phenomena is a very real, and powerful tool.  Specifically,  these people
induced altered-states-of-consciousness (ASC's), and used astral-projection
(out-of-body travel) to remote-view enemy sites, gather information, and
learn things that were not supposed to be known outside of very tight circles.
The techniques they had developed were sound, and could be reproduced by
individuals who had the propensity towards this "sixth sense."  David 
happened to be one of these people, that is why he was chosen and trained to
be a psychic spy for the US Army.
    The experiences however, had very definite side effects that nobody could
explain.  Morehouse was prone to going into trance at random, sometimes while
driving his car.  Also he had vivid dreams of his family being brutally
murdered, and the face under the murderer's mask being his own.  Frequently
he woke up screaming.  It was starting to get out of control;  he was
losing his family, and his sanity.  He continued working however, hoping and
believing that what he was doing would lead to the answer to his problems,
for there were benefits to being able to travel out-of-body.  He saw the
potential for mankind, given this knowledge.  Unfortunately he did not realize
that the answer to his problems lay within him.  The mental stress began to
take its toll.  His behaviour now exhibited that of a mental patient.  He
couldn't sleep, for fear of lucid nightmares that left him sweating with fear.
Around this time he also realized that hiding the knowledge of the army's
remote-viewing practices was wrong.  The information could greatly benefit
society (or so he believed), and he began a plan to expose the whole unit.
    His family was the first to learn about what went on in the unit.  They
shared his belief that the knowledge should not be kept secret any longer.
Little did they know what awaited them on this path of government exposure,
for if they did, they perhaps might have rethought the whole thing.
Officials eventually got wind of his desire for publicizing the events that
took place during the 20 years that the STARGATE program was in operation.
Small threats inevitably lead to death threats, and it was when somebody
tried to kill him and his family that David Morehouse clearly saw the US Army
for what it was, and what it had become.  They used their knowledge about him
in attempts to stop his actions, and their ruthlessness was unforgivable.
    It was bigger than them though.  Morehouse had selected himself as the
one to make public the knowledge of the army's remote-viewing experiments.
Because of his one-track mindedness, Morehouse succeeded in his desire to
expose the activities that went on during those fateful months he was in the
unit.  The army denied 95% of his claims, also denying the validity of
"remote-viewing" for defense purposes.  Their tactics went straight from
hiding the truth, to manipulating it.  Not once did it occur to them to simply
admit their actions, and take responsibility.  Most would sooner have died,
than admit to a conspiracy/coverup.
    The events described here within are all true, and can be verified by
newsmedia, books, and some government documents.  The tale is a fascinating
one, combining elements of science fiction, suspense, and conspiracy.  David
Morehouse was a person who dared to be more than what society expected.  He
rose above the law, conquered space-time, and lived to tell the story of both.
He no longer works with the army in any way, and spoke at the 1996 world
conference on issues of peace, and nonviolent ways to solve disputes.
    It is at the discretion of the reader as to what he/she learns from this
article;  but remember, your thoughts create your reality, and only *you*
can be held responsible for your thoughts.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
The IRS, death and taxes:

Of all of the bureaucracies in the Unites States, one of the most corrupt and
cold-hearted is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The IRS has tremendous
powers in which they use to rape and pillage Americans.  Without a hearing, or
any other form of due process, the IRS can seize property, pay checks, homes and
shut down businesses.  It is because the IRS is the absolute judge, jury, and
executioner during a tax audit, it is no wonder that they are capable of
financially, or even physically destroying the lives of many Americans.

IRS managers keep track of citizens that they consider to be `tax protesters'
and `political dissidents' that disagree with the government of the day.  It is
no coincidence in my mind that people like Paula Jones have been audited by the
IRS.  They'll make someone's life hell on a request from a corrupt politician,
or will independently act on their behalf.  In addition, the culture within the
IRS encourages the exploitation of taxpayers that don't have the resources to
fight back.  Former IRS employees have revealed that IRS managers compile a list
of individuals and small businesses that are what they consider to be `easy
prey.'

It is said that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and that is precisely
what has happened within the IRS.  IRS managers foster a culture of greed
and powertripping.  Despite what the IRS says, it is a fact that IRS agents are
rewarded by bonuses or promotion in direct relation to the amount of tax,
interest, and penalty money they can seize.  At the heart of their schemes
is the fact that they can claim any amount of back taxes, with penalties and
interest, and it can't be contested.  If their actions destroy a person or
family's quality of life, it's a bonus to those sick bastards.  One example of
hundreds of abuse by IRS agents that I have read, an agent told a man he was
auditing that he was "worth more dead" so that the IRS could seize his life
insurance policy.  When the man reported this, the agent denied it and his
manager accused the man of lying.  In my opinion, he will be harassed by the
IRS for the rest of his life.

The tactics IRS agents use during an audit are cruel and appalling.  When
they have selected their target, they attack with no mercy.  And if an
American actually cooperates fully with the IRS, they are digging their own
financial grave.  In one case, a married couple that ran a small business
paid a penalty of $6000 because the agent told them "well, it appears that you
paid these returns correctly, but understand, we are paid to bring in money.  If
you don't pay us something now, I'll just come back with another list of
requests."  Approximately six years later, the IRS required that they had to
prove that they paid taxes the previous seven years.  At that time a heavy lien
was put against their home as an added "bonus" for their earlier assistance.

Another corrupt tactic that the bastards in the IRS use to inflict mental
stress upon their victims is known as the "whipshaw technique."  This technique
is used to coerce a taxpayer to `pay up' by punishing innocent relatives through
liens, levies, seizures, etc.  Yet another example of the corrupt use of their
unbridled power.  The IRS intentionally developed this tactic to humiliate and
isolate their victims from their family and friends.

Another convenient way for the IRS to destroy the lives of their victims is to
lie and claim that they didn't received forms, or payments on outstanding taxes.
This goes far beyond recovering taxes from those that owe the Treasury
department... it is a blatant and unprovoked attack against Americans that
can't afford to fight them in court.  And that is when the IRS really twists the
knife.  Their follow-up tactic is to charge late payment penalties and interest
*and* to pocket the payments they have already received.  Then it's up to the
taxpayer to prove that the IRS received their forms, payments, etc.  The reason
they do this is simple; greed.  In one reported case, two years after the fact
the IRS told a taxpayer that they didn't have a man's 1992 tax return.  They
demanded back taxes *plus* a penalty of $6000.  How could the man prove that the
IRS didn't have the tax return when it is a fact that they do?  It is
contemptible that the IRS is able to lie, or claim that they "lost files" and
put it all on the back of the taxpayer.

Unfortunately, not every American is strong enough to handle the oppressive
shadow that the IRS casts upon their lives.  The corrupt and evil ways in
which IRS agents act have driven people to suicide.  However, not even suicide
and the destruction of families will stop the IRS from their relentless greed,
and their need to exert their powers.  I read a report from a widow suffering
from severe mental stress.  She reported how the IRS took advantage of her
husband's suicide (his escape from the hell they were putting him through) by
placing liens on both of her husband's life insurance policies that were
intended to provide for her and her daughter.  And the IRS is not done yet.
IRS agents are stalking her by telephone and unannounced house visits,
revelling in their power that they use without any accountability.

I hope that this article has given you a small glimpse into how corrupt
government bureaucracies truly are.  Instead of serving the citizens of their
country, they prey upon them... destroying their hopes, dreams, and lives.
Breaking up families, and driving people to suicide is the result of their
corrupt use of the absolute power they wield without fear of recourse.  It is my
opinion that this kind of abuse is only the beginning as our civil rights and
liberties are eliminated and ignored.  Remember that knowledge is power.  If a
bureaucracy as greedy and corrupt as the IRS comes after you, fight back.  Don't
give up destroyed and say "what can I do about it?"  That is when they have won.

While using the Internet to obtain background information for this article, I
came across a web site in which victims of the IRS were gathering testimony in
preparation for a class-action lawsuit.  The IRS Abuse Reports relate their
horrible experiences much better than I can.  You may wish to see first-hand
accounts of how the IRS has destroyed the lives of hundreds of hard-working
Americans.  The website address of the IRS Abuse Reports is:

DRUGS DISCUSSION -                                                  {DRUGS}
An introduction to the newest section:

    This commences a new section that will continue throughout several
Newsletters.  Drugs are mind-altering substances;  for this reason, I feel it
important to discuss the current drug situation in our society.  There are
too many aspects of this topic to limit it to one article;  as such, this is
merely an introduction to which perspectives I will be covering, and my views
on them.

   -Legality issues must be addressed - should drugs be legal/decriminalized?
   -Personal experiences will be shared and discussed.
   -Drugs in different cultures, eras.
   -Types of drugs, classes of drugs, and effects of drugs will be covered.
   -True facts and events will be looked at, and commented upon.
   -The drug war in North America/the globe is an issue.
   -Focus on Hemp/Cannabis and its advantages/disadvantages
   -Drugs and life, drugs and consciousness, philosophical aspects discussed.
   -Hallucinogens, cosmic-consciousness, religion discussed.

    Some discussion will be serious, while others more humorous, and others
still, a mixture of both.  I hope you look forward to reading this section
as much as I look forward to writing it.  Those who know me know that life
is a very interesting subject to me.  To blindly think that all drugs are bad
is such a detrimental belief it astounds me.  Drugs fascinate me;  and I don't
necessarily mean experimenting with them.  Theoretical discussion of the
effects of DMT for example can be quite fascinating, without having to do the
drug oneself.  That is not to say I haven't done a lot of drugs.  Of the most
popular drugs available, it would be faster for me to tell you that I have not
done Crack, Cocaine, or Heroine.  I have tried most others however, thus do
not consider myself a "newbie" to drugs by any means.  Because drugs are
illegal though, I have a hard time believing that what pill I am buying is
really what it is supposed to be.  See what I mean?  How can I put my trust
into something that was probably concocted in a bathtub?

These and many more interesting thoughts coming soon.  If you care to leave
me feedback with any comments/experiences you have, I will gladly incorporate
them into my articles.  Otherwise, look for the new Drugs Discussion section in
the next issue of the newsletter.

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                            {H/P}
Tips on scanning 1-800s:

This article won't teach you everything that there is to know about scanning
1-800s.  Also, it will not give you any instructions on how to hack them.
The purpose of this article is to teach you some intelligent scanning methods.
If you're asking yourself, "What does intelligent scanning mean?" then you
definitely need to read this section very carefully.

In order to scan intelligently, obviously you first need to know what that
means.  In brief, it means scanning efficiently, stealthfully and finding the
desired targets quickly.  Sometimes speed can be of the essence.  You can't
find anything fast if you try to randomly scan all of 1-800-555-XXXX.  It
would take forever to scan and log it all, not to mention the fact that many
of the reachable numbers would prove to be absolutely useless to you.  So,
instead of wasting your time and putting yourself at risk, learn how to scan
intelligently.  Every single method won't be discussed in this article.  The
reason being, you cannot rely on a text file as your only source of learning.
You must experiment and develop your own techniques using your own ideas.
However, since I'm in a kind and generous mood, I will give you a few tried
and tested tips to try out.  :)

First, there's the ToneLoc (or THC-Scan etc.) approach.  I don't recommend it
unless you're beige boxing or only going to dial less than a hundred 1-800s
per session/day.  If you're out beige boxing, then you don't have to worry
about scanning randomly.  Try scanning sequentially, unless you're paranoid.
As an example, you could use a mask of 1-800-555-5XXX and allow it to scan for
an hour or two.  You can sit there watching and listening as it's scanning, or
leave.  Just don't forget to go back to retrieve your trusty laptop.  :)  Also,
always create different data files for separate exchanges.  It keeps your scans
much more organized that way.  Plus, then you can exchange them with other
phreaks in your area.  If a group of people work together to scan a 1-800
exchange, it'll go a lot faster.  Just assign one person to scan 1-800-555-1XXX
and the next to do 1-800-555-2XXX and so on.  Eventually all of 1-800-555-XXXX
will have been scanned, and you can share your findings.  Plus, if you use
separate data files, you can upload them to h/p boards in exchange for codes
etc.  That's another benefit to scanning intelligently, you'll find a lot more.
Just remember, only upload scans that are worthwhile.  In other words, not ones
that are 90% voice/busy's with the rest shitty carriers.  If you upload shit,
there's a great chance that you'll lose your access to those h/p boards.

Second, there's the manual dialing approach (pressing the little buttons on
your phone).  :)  By using this method, it's much safer since it's more
randomized.  By that, I just mean that the delay time between dials will be
different, the amount of time between each button being pressed will vary,
the amount of rings won't be the same, the amount of time "connected" won't
either etc.  Therefore, it is safe to use this method from home.  However, you
must make sure to limit the number of 1-800s that you scan each session.  A
good tip is to have multiple scan sessions per day.  In each session, dial 20
or 30 1-800 numbers.  Don't just "pick anything".  Scan intelligently.  Try
1-800-XXX-2255.  (2255 is CALL).  That's just an example.  You can also try
something like 1-800-XXX-0400 or 1-800-XXX-0500 etc.  There are patterns that
you can pick up on.  Sometimes the patterns are intricate, and other times they
are simple and easy to discover.  If you find a useful code that's
1-800-999-1110 then try dialing 1-800-999-1120 etc.  Sometimes you can find
multiple codes that way very quickly.  :)  Just as, you can try 1-800-225-5XXX
(1-800-CALL-XXX) and try random last 3 digits.  Once you find some codes in a
1-800-XXX exchange, then sometimes you might want to scan it all.  Other times,
you might only want a certain code that you found scanning intelligently.  It
all depends on what you're into, and how much time you have to spend scanning,
how many codes you want or need etc.  The point is that you don't always have
to scan the entire exchange to find the codes that you want.

Here's another tip.  If you find a code (like a 1-800 VMB or ANI or something)
that's 1-800-222-2020 as an example, scan around it.  By that, I mean do the
same thing as you'd do if you found one end of a loop.  To find the other end,
you have to scan above or below it depending on what end of the loop you found.
With 1-800s, you should scan above and below the found code.  The reason is that
you can usually find multiple codes that are the same that way.  For example,
if you found an ANI that's 1-800-222-5000 there might be another ANI that's
1-800-222-4000.  Even though that is just an example, I have seen that many
times before... The reason that I'm not listing usable 1-800s is because I don't
know what ones are reachable from other area codes, Canada etc.  Some 1-800s
work for all of North America, others are limited to the United States and some
are only dialable from that state, area code etc.  There's a great range, so
it would be pointless for me to list valid ones that might only work in my area.
Also, don't write off or ignore an entire 1-800 exchange just because one or two
numbers can't be dialed for free from your calling area.  That's definitely not
intelligent scanning, since you could miss out on a lot of cool codes.  I hope
that you enjoyed reading this article, benefit from the methods that I've
discussed and the tips that I've shared.  In conclusion, you should be creative,
use your imigination and learn how to scan intelligently.  If you follow that
advice, then you will soon have more useful codes than you can imagine...  More
importantly, you'll have the ability to find the ones that you need quickly
without scanning entire exchanges for days.

On a personal note, I'm moving again.  This time, it looks as though it'll be
permanent.  I am going out to Montana.  I don't want to mention the town, for
several reasons.  At any rate, I don't know how active I'm going to be in the
h/p scene anymore.  I've considered unofficially "retiring".  I'll still remain
in contact with a few people, and I'm not quitting Damage, INC.  However, it
is very unlikely that I'll be able to contribute as often to the Damage, INC.
Newsletter.  I still want to write articles etc. but the extent of my
involvement in the group will be severely limited.  I won't have nearly as much
free time after I start work at my new job.  I just want to thank everyone that
has ever helped me out, and thank Damage, INC. for the experience and knowledge
that I've learned because of the group.  Also, thanks to anyone that reads and
enjoys my articles.  Lastly, have fun scanning and don't forget to phreak
safely.  :)

˙ - NEWS - ˙

We're proud to announce that Fatal Vision is the newest Damage, INC. Member.
He's going to contribute to future issues of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.
In a relatively short period of time, he's managed to learn a fair amount about
h/p and what it means.  Everyone in the group is pleased with his progress and
we're looking forward to seeing him become an active member.

The Damage, INC. FAQ should be complete and ready to release with the next
issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter in April.  It will contain information
about the group, past, present, future plans as well as answer frequently asked
questions etc.  However, it won't be an ordinary FAQ.  It will be unlike any
other FAQ that you've read, or exists for that matter.  Damage, INC. is about
uniqueness, individuality and going against the grain... Everything that we
release proves that statement to be true.  So, look for the FAQ of all fucking
FAQs to be released soon and available on a quality h/p board near you.  ;)

Also, I spoke with Blackie Lawless after he submitted the above article on
scanning 1-800s.  He assured me that it won't be his last, but it might be a
few months before he has time to write and contribute anything else.  I know
that he isn't planning on "retiring" from the scene forever.  He told me that
he wants to take a break from it though, even after he's moved and settled in
Montana.  I fully understand that, as I've often thought about doing the exact
same thing... Plus, it's not good to stay in the scene for 'too long' if you
are very actively involved, as it might catch up with you eventually.  So, I
don't blame him if he feels that taking some time off will help him avoid
being busted for something.  However, I have no knowledge of his activities,
or what's going on, so that's just a hypothesis at best... ;)

In other local (519) news, The Crypt Keeper is back.  He plans to setup his
board (The Crypt) again... and wants to resurrect a.t.i.  We'll have to wait
and see what develops, especially after the recent Highlamer incidents of him
claiming to be a Member of a.t.i and creating fake releases etc.

Artistry's interrogation of Topsoil:

This interrogation was done by Artistry.  He captured this chat and sent a copy
of it to Damage, INC.  His intention was that we would include it in this issue

the sysop has broken in to chat

<T> - yeah?

<A> - hey.. are you into hacking?  1-800s?

<T> - ... ... uhhh.. i wanna be, but i know nothin...

[ Look...He admitted that he's a wannabe that knows nothing.  What a shock. ]

<A> - oh.. I thought someone said you were making a list of them...

<T> - i was.. they were like.. not computers or nothing.. and umm.. i lost that
list now, forgot to back it up before i formated my HD...

[ Topsoil is always formatting his hard drive. ]

<A> - okay.  do you know what the validation pword on foi is?  I applied but
can't get access.

<T> - no clue... he just validated me ... about a day or two after i called so..

[ Even Topsoil doesn't know why he was validated on FoI. ]

<A> - ok no problem.  uh, do you know of any other h/p boards around here that
are local?

<T> - heh..i hardly even read my own mail on my own board.. i don't call out at
all anymore so...

[ But he doesn't call boards anymore, except to leech h/p files from FoI. ]

<A> - Oh... umm... you don't call foi?

<T> - nah... haven't in.. oh.. i dunno.. since november or so... not sure
exactly...

[ That's strange since I remember reading posts by Topsoil on FoI after that. ]

<A> - i read about a board called the crypt and some group called ati.. should I
join it?

<T> - umm.. i dunno.. i've heard a lot of crap about ati, and well, it sounds
kinda like it sucks.. and besides, i don't really like the crypt keeper.. i was
on his board a while back.. and well, he had lots of viruses and stuff... not a
whole lot of h/p or anything like that... but that was a while ago.. and      
umm.. i'm not even sure if his board is still up..

[ But The Freezer is a great h/p board right?  Haha. ]

<A> - alright.. so then are there any *good* h/p groups in this area?  I'm still
kinda new... but want to join one really bad.

<T> - heh.. yeha... i'm still sorta new too.. and well.. umm.. i'm not sure of
one.. damage inc is cool.. 'cept for blackened.. i don't like him.. but the   
rest of the group is cool..

[ Oh no, Topsoil doesn't like me.  ;) ]

<A> - hmm... why don't ya like him?  hehe

<T> - heh... actuaully, i think i've no wiped out my hard drive more times than
he's wiped out mine.. heh.. that's hard to accomplish. but ahg well.. ehh/.

[ You can't blame anyone else when you nuke yourself with trojans Topsoil. ]

<A> - hehe.. so how abouts would I go about joining damage inc?  talk to him?

<T> - ... not sure... just talk to the journalist, his board is a member board..
so he should know...

[ FoI is a Damage, INC. Dist. Site.  Before you give advice, make sure you know
what you're talking about. ]

<A> - ya.. okay.. cool.  I noticed you've got some of their releases online
here.. have ya read any of them, and are they any good?

<T> - ..  well, i read the first few.. (2 or 3.. forget how many..) and well,
the one had a trojan's source code at the end.. and i wanted to try it out.. and
i did.. and wiped myself.. and well, blackened is honest in those and stuff.. 
and for the utils that damage inc. has released.. i've never tried them, but  
apparently they do what they say they do...

[ Wow.  We're all impressed that you were able to use TASM on the source code.
However, source code isn't executable.  Again, you're responsible for nuking
yourself.  Yes, I am honest.  Apparently?  You execute trojans but are afraid
to use Damage, INC. Utilities?  <shaking my head> ]

<A> - hmm.. cool.  hey, do you program?  I read a message about something you
were working on...

<T> - ... i know turing... and well, can't really do a whole lot in there...
examples.. you can't use the com port, you can't edit an .EXE file or         
anything like that (at least not that easily) and umm.. well, it's a cheapo   
beginner language.. i started to make a BBSList program for the board.. but   
kinda got stuck not being able to use the modem.. heh...

[ Turing?  <G> ]

<A> - hehe... yeah, it was the bbslist thing that I read about.  sounds cool
though.  I'm starting to learn pascal.  is that language any good?  like will
I be able to program some utilities eventually with it?

<T> - oh yeah.. if you learn it... i'd probably say that it's.. .. either the
BEST or the second BEST programming language out there... probably best though..
C/C++ is cool.. but i don't know..i tried it, and got totally confused so..   
most programs are written in pascal though.. eg. this bbs software was        
written in pascal..... or something.. wait.. it was written in turbo          
pascal... and i THINK their the same.. not sure though.. ah well..

[ Turbo Pascal is the best programming language out there?  <SH> again. ]

<A> - yeah, that's what we're learning in school... but I'm just starting to get
the hang of it.  hehe.  I should check out some of those utilities that you
have on your board... and see what they're like.  do you know anything about  
how to get started, like learning how to program stuff like viruses and       
trojans?

<T> - well.. .. no..:) .. umm... for viruses and stuff.. i think.. assembly is
best for that..and well, that seems easy to learn.. just grab a program like
VCL, and it will make source code for you.. and you just compile it.. easy..

[ VCL will generate assembly source code, as will any other virus generator.
That isn't programming a virus though.  That's called running a shitty program
that creates .asm source code for viruses that are detectable by any virus
scanner.  Nothing more. ]

<A> - what's assembly? a language?

<T> - yup..

[ <applause>  Good answer. ]

<A> - okay.. cool.. so are they usually made in assembly?

<T> - yeah.. it makes the files real small.. like.. 3k.. and well, to do the
same thing in turbo pascal or c/c++ it would be like.. ... i dunno.. 10k or
something.. so .. assembly is smaller.. but not as powerful...

[ Haha.  You really have a way with words.  You have a talent for explaining
things that you know nothing about to people.  Assembly is smaller but not as
powerful?  Wrong again man. ]

<A> - cool... also, I wanted to ask you about carding.  I posted a message
asking about it but just got bashed..

<T> - uh-huh.. question?

[ You should consider changing your alias to the Guru.  ;) ]

<A> - What is it?  How can I learn more about carding?  Is it like.. using VISA
cards or something like that?  or am I thinking of something else..hehe

<T> - .,, nah, that's it.. umm.. i dunno.. if you wanna learn some stuff about
it... like.. good methods and stuff, since a lot of them don't work, umm.. in 
the file areas, there's PLA*.ZIP... those have a lot of ... carding stuff in  
... mostly calling cards .. but you can use the same type of stuff for visa   
etc. ... and well, they have some phreaking stuff in too... they're no ratio  
so.. get whatever you want... umm.. and well, you can read the descriptions   
too..

[ Yeah, the Phone Losers of America issues are excellent sources of information
man.  The only thing I don't understand is why they don't use a 1-800 VMB and
have a few boxes.  I mean, their leader used to pay monthly for a box... for
a shitty local VMB in his area code.  Haha. ]

<A> - cool.. I will.. and I don't know much about phreaking yet either but I
want to learn.  do you know much about PBXs, VMBs, ANIs?  I also read about
firewall hacking in the bases here, but don't really know much about that...  
or how to remove firewalls.  there's one at school that prevents us from      
going to h/p sites.  hehe

<T> - hheh.. yeah.. i've gotten pissed of at that firewall too.. .. umm.. i
tried getting around it by going to.. www.anonymizer.com...; which will just
copy the page onto their server, and then send it over to you, so your computer
never actually goes the page at all.. but they firewalled that server. damn.. 
and umm.. well.. then i tried converting the .. domain name                   
(www.anonymizer.com) over to the IP address (209.xxx.xxx.xxx or osmething     
like that) and well.. that is firewalled too.. so not sure about that.. as    
far as.. PBXs go... i forget what the stand for again so.. :) umm.. VMBs,     
iknow that i have one on my cell phone, and ,.. ANIs, i have call display on  
my cell phone, so for that i just call up my cell phone which is usually in   
my hand, and i just read off the numbe.r.:)

[ Read a text file on firewalls d00d. ]

<A> - cool.. do you have a laptop and beige box?  also, i need an extender.. to
call like Guelph and Toronto...

<T> - ... yeah... umm.. laptop, nah, i can't afford everytrhing.. heh.. umm..
beige box.. .i wanna make one.. but well,i haven't got the cash right now.. damn
phone companies.. i had $150 in phone bills this month.. heh... umm.. but     
yeah, soon i'm gonna try and build a red box, and beige box... umm..          
extenders.. i don't got any... if i felt like it, i'd consider using toneloc  
or something like that, but since i don't call guelph any more, i don't       
really care about it...

[ Quit paying $150 to Bell and you might have more money.  ;)  Oh, forget about
trying to build a red box and beige box.  That's too difficult for you. ]

<A> - ya.. i just want to call some ld boards... like in Toronto.. hehe.. but
don't wanna pay ld to Bell.  :)

<T> - yeah.. in the pla files, they'll tell you about third number billing.. and
how you can do that.. so then you don't have the ld, some other guy in..      
oihh.. b.c. has it.. and he won't bother to call you back, since it will just 
cost more money, and if he does call you back, just hang up.. if bell calls   
you.. you know nothing about that... easy..

[ That's an excellent method to use.  Thanks for the great information. ]

<A> - hehe... yeah, that sounds like a good idea.  do you know how to hack ISPs
and get free internet accounts?  I can't afford to pay for one.. :)

<T> - yeah.. i can't afford the net either... so i just got my friend to get an
unlimited account, and the provider just happens to let up to 100 people use  
the same account, at the same time.. ehh..

[ 100 people.  Keep that number in mind and read the excuse Topsoil uses next. ]

<A> - hehe.. can you give me the login and pword?  :)

<T> - nah... i'm not alowed to give it out.. cuz well, there's 10 people who
already have it, and well, he doesn't want the provider billing him for all   
10 of those people when they notice they're being ripped off.. heh..

[ That shouldn't matter if they allow 100 people to use the same account, like
you said previously.  ;) ]

<A> - hehe.. okay... umm.. do you know how I can get access to some other h/p
boards, like foi and ajfa?  I keep seeing people posting about boards like    
that...but can't seem to get access... hehe.

<T> - heh.. umm.. well, once you get on foi, .. e-mail blackened from there
about ajfa.. umm.. .. foi.. well, hopefully you're on that now.. umm.. and well,
those are the only h/p boards i know of.. anyways, i've gotta go now ..       
getting tired.. and i got to surf the net first period tomorrow in schjool...

[ Nah, my board is invite only.  That won't work.  Go surf the net d00d. ]

<A> - hehe.. okay...but uh, I applied to foi and he has a validation password
for new users, so I can't logon yet... :(  and ummmm... so blackened runs ajfa?
I didn't know that... hmm... does he like run damage inc or something?

<T> -  .. you'll be validated by.. .. the journalist on foi, in the next day or
two.. and ... umm.. yeah, blackened runs ajfa, and ,.. damage inc, i'm not    
sure who runs that, but ajfa is the WHQ of.. damage inc.. 

[ Become informed before you try to answer questions. ]

<A> -  okay... now I understand.. :)  cool.  thanx for the info then man.
hope to chat again sometime... 

<T> - yup, ok, l8rz..

[ The above line says it all. ]

yOu are now back in the freezer

Editor - I wish to take this opportunity to thank you man.  The interrogation
         of you done by Fatal Vision was simply hilarious.  It contained your
         own words and answers to his questions.  I had to publish that and
         share it with our readers.  ;)

         As for the lesson you claim to have learned, I am skeptical to say
         the least considering the amount of false statements that you've
         blatantly made on boards in the past few months.  Always remember that
         anything you post on boards can be captured.  Learn from your
         experience.

         Also, you were never a Member of a.t.i.  So, you're lying yet again.
         Did you honestly believe that you could fool everyone?  The fake
         a.t.i releases that contained ripped off Copyrighted Damage, INC.
         material impressed nobody.  Did you do that in a pathetic attempt to
         get a reputation?  Or are you just stupid?  You're a ph34r3d l33t
         hax0r d00d now Highlord...


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
The existence of intelligent alien life in the Universe:

Does intelligent life exist elsewhere in the Universe?  If there are alien
races on other planets, are they technologically advanced enough to know of
our existence?  Have this visited this planet before?  Is it possible that
they have been evolving for millions or billions of years before life began
on Earth?  These are just a few interesting and valid questions that you should
spend some time thinking about.

The Universe consists of billions of galaxies.  In those galaxies, there are
many stars, planets, moons etc. of varying ages.  The Universe is a vast place,
and is so extremely large that it's difficult to comprehend.  We do not
understand it.  In fact, we don't even understand the complexity of gravity yet.
Therefore, how can *anyone* say that there isn't intelligent life on other
planets?  Have we explored them?  No, of course not.  The fastest machines built
by humans were the Voyager space probes.  They gave us the first "close" looks
at planets such as Jupiter.  Obviously, that planet is within our own solar
system and not a tremendous distance away from Earth.  Recently, we've started
exploring planets such as Mars and manned missions are planned to investigate
further.  They've looked at rocks from Mars that show (and prove in my opinion)
that there was life on Mars, albeit primitive "bacteria-like creatures" at one
time.  Scientists such as the late Carl Sagan and others believed that more
exploration is necessary.  They also believed that there's a great chance of
intelligent life on other planets and that we shouldn't just categorically rule
it out.  I agree with that point of view.  It'd be idiot to ignore the
possibility that life exists on other planets.  To assume that life only exists
on this planet would be both arrogant and ignorant.  It would also be the
biggest, worst assumption that anyone has ever made.

Let's say that out of the billions of galaxies and countless planets... that
there isn't any intelligent life in the entire Universe, except on Earth.  Do
you know what the odds of that are?  The odds of that are "astronomical" to
say the least.  So, why place an uneducated guess or bet that there's no life
out there?  It's not only possible, it is very plausible that intelligent life
could exist (or could've existed in the past) on other planets.  If the only
life in the Universe is on Earth, what is the purpose of the billions of
lifeless planets?  Why are there so many galaxies and stars?  Why were they
all created?  Wouldn't that mean that life evolving on Earth was a fluke?
Or perhaps, it's a cosmic joke.  Haha.  That possibility seems unlikely to me
for many reasons.  The biggest reason is that I don't consider human life to be
just a fluke of nature.  Why not?  Well, if that were true it'd mean that fluke
after fluke after fluke happened on this planet since it's filled with living
creatures.  Consider the diverseness of this planet for a second and you'll
understand my logic.

Also, the Universe is much older than we are.  Did it take human evolution for
there to be intelligent life in this enormous space?  We'd be very egotistical
to think that we are the only intelligent species in the entire Universe.  Or,
is there more than one Universe?  The answer to that question relies upon your
own beliefs.  I cannot answer it for you.  What if the truth is that we *are*
the only advanced life in this Universe though.  What if every other planet in
the Universe is lifeless?  What if that theory could be proved to be correct.
That would make everything meaningless.  If life forming on this planet happened
by a fluke, then there is no meaning to life.  There is no point in anything.
Everything would mean nothing.  At least, that's how I would personally feel.

On the other hand, if we could prove that intelligent life exists on other
planets, that would change everything.  That would give us new meaning.  That'd
mean our existence isn't the greatest fluke ever.  It might also mean that we
are their seed, that the aliens visited earth long ago.  It could also mean that
there was life on other planets before Earth.  They could've been evolving as
being for millions of years before Earth could even sustain and support life.
;)  Of course, the possibility exists that there is intelligent life on other
planets that started evolving after us... and that they aren't quite as advanced
yet.  Indeed, the possibilities are endless.

I'd also like to comment on Terra-Forming.  We have the knowledge, ability and
technology to turn a suitable lifeless planet into one that evolves... and
eventually can support life.  Essentially, we can change the environment over
time and "create" life that otherwise wouldn't have developed naturally.  The
chosen planet has to endure drastic changes in its biology, but it is possible.
Terra-Forming is a very long process that requires hundreds of years in order
to change a planet.  However, we could use the process to change a planet that's
reachable from Earth into a new world for mankind to inhabit and manage.  If we
can successfully accomplish that, (Terra-Forming involves changing and/or
creating the atmosphere using different methods including the formation of
oceans by releasing water from ice or rock, the removal of harmful gases etc.)
then why wouldn't there already be planets that are capable of supporting life
throughout the Universe?  If we can transform or convert a "dead planet" into
one that future generations can live on, then it's only logical that out of
billions of galaxies there would be at least a few "living planets".  ;)

Yes, that is my opinion and you have the right to disagree or choose to ignore
that logic, form your own opinion and live by your personal beliefs.  Basically,
I just think that if we can manage to find a way to explore other regions of
the Universe, are able to change planets through terra-forming, and make
discoveries that would have been unimaginable less than 100 years ago... then
it's very possible that alien beings know about and can do the same things.
Perhaps they know more about space, time, the Universe, propulsion, technology
in general etc. than we do.  They could've been travelling and exploring space
long before our evolutionary process began (or our creation).  They might have
known of us from the beginning, and not think of humans as being advanced
beings.  ;)  Hopefully I've given you something to think about.

                 ring to be generated on the current line; Hold keeps a call

[M: *xx] - alternate code used for MLVP (multi-line variety package)
                 by Bellcore. It goes by different names in different RBOCs.
                 In Bellsouth it is called Prestige. It is an arrangement of
                 ESSEX like features for single or small multiple line groups.

                 The reason for different codes for some features in MLVP is that
                 call-pickup is *8 in MLVP so all *8x codes are reaasigned *5x


*** Note from Damage, INC. - Bell's Call Screening can be defeated by using a
                             good diverter, contrary to popular belief.  I just
                             wanted to dispel the commonly held misconception
                             that Call Screening stops a person from calling
                             you from the line/number you try to block/reject.
                             Hopefully, this short note clears that up for
                             everyone that falsely believes that it does.  ;)

Damage, INC. Directory Trojan Source Code:

This trojan nukes files in every directory off the root of the current drive.
Then it creates directories to replace the files that were nuked.  Once that's
finished, it changes to the root directory of the current drive and creates a
directory named NUKE.  You can't RD it or CD into it normally from a DOS prompt.
Lastly, the "Nuked by Damage, INC." message is decrypted and then displayed.
The first type of encryption used (for NUKE) is a very simple XOR method.  The
second type uses SUB (subtract) for the damage message.  Both types used should
be easy enough to understand.

THE JOURNALIST'S TOP TEN LIST -                                   {TOP TEN}
"Think of the possibilities..."

    We are quickly approaching the dawn of a new millennium.  The Age of
Aquarius - love, peace, and enlightenment.  With it come new responsibilities,
and new freedoms.  I believe the true nature of existence will emerge as the
hidden answer everybody is waiting for. 
    This month's top ten list is a little different.  I am a firm believer
in the idea that man is not limited by his physical body.  Arm yourself with
the knowledge necessary to survive in the coming new age world.  The only
knowledge that when put into practice, truly will set you free.  

    1. Meditation.
       This marks the beginning of a journey that will lead you closer to
       yourself and the underlying reality available to everyone.  Diligent
       exercise of clearing your mind always results in the attainment of
       higher states of consciousness.  Zen Buddhists have known the potential
       of this art for many centuries now.  Pick up a good book on meditation
       if you are seriously interested in beginning the mystical life most
       people only dream about.

    2. Lucid Dreaming.
       In our dreams we are orchestrating those events which we cannot readily
       act out in everyday life.  Dreaming represents the mind's
       interpretation of activity far beyond the conscious level.  As you
       notice upon wakening, the dream often is as "real" as daily life - that
       is because it *is* real!  Just not in the same way you are used to.
       Lucid dreaming occurs when in a dream, you become aware that you are
       dreaming.  It is exciting!  You can now control your dream, direct it
       the way you want.  The simple suggestion before you fall asleep of "I
       am going to have a lucid dream" will put into motion the desire to
       wake up in your dreams.  Try it!

    3. Astral-Projection.
       Entering into trance, you feel the familiar buzzing throughout your
       body characteristic of regular meditation.  Your body feels lighter
       and lighter, and suddenly you are free.  Free from gravity, free from
       solid matter, and free from the incessant activity of everyday
       society.  Your thoughts lead you on an adventure unknown to most.
       Thinking of your deceased Aunt, you are immediately transported to a
       face-to-face meeting with her.  The exhilaration associated with this
       technique is *unparalleled*.

    4. Remote Viewing.
       This was the subject of my earlier article.  With enough practice
       in meditation and astral-projection, remote viewing can become an
       entirely viable activity for any student of the psychic phenomena.
       When you remote-view, your body stays in one place, while your mind
       traverses the universe, unbounded by space and time.  Simply by
       wishing yourself somewhere you can be instantly transported there.
       You can see past events as if you are right there while it happened.
       It is as if you are at a huge library of everything that ever occurred
       in the universe, and you can pick any experience you want.  When the
       army attempts to utilize transcendental experiences like this for
       military gain, you can understand why certain disaster occurs! 

    5. Hypnosis/Mind Control
       Hypnosis is something which, for the most part, is readily accepted by
       society.  Its full power is not yet realized though.  Hypnosis is the
       process by which one person, well-versed in the subject, uses his/her
       abilities to transport another person into an ASC.  From this point,
       the "subject" is in a very suggestible state, and can be made to do
       anything, believe anything that the hypnotist desires!  The fact that
       one human can control another like a puppet should scare the living
       shit out of us.  But it doesn't.  Why do you think that is? 

    6. Channeling
       I have read books channelled from entities beyond our dimension.
       Sound like science fiction?  Think again.  As indicated, channelling
       is essentially when a human being "lends" his/her body to a separate
       entity for the purpose of communicating a message.  Usually the
       channelled being is of much higher awareness than we can know.  But
       that is why they visit.  To bring us closer to awareness.  To put into
       words information which is not currently known to our consciousness.
       This is similar to automatic writing, whereby a writer experiences a
       force "taking control" of the pen, and writing whole books while the
       writer is under trance.  Consult the list at the bottom if you are
       interested in reading a channelled book.

    7. Parallel Universe Theory
       Without totally confusing you, I want to enlighten you as to some of
       the current ways modern science has accepted the existence of psychic
       phenomena.  One of these is the parallel universes theory.  This
       describes our physical universe as but one of an infinite amount of
       universes, each one unique.  Every action is broken down into choices,
       and the different outcome of each choice is manifested as a new,
       "potential" reality.  On the sub-atomic level, it is believed that at
       every instant a photon has the option to go one of two different paths,
       two different universes will be created, each identical except that in
       one the photon went left, and in the other it went right (for example).
       The basis is that *every* possibility, every permutation of events must
       exist in a separate universe, each independent of the observer, (the
       person perceiving the events). 

    8. Holographic Universe Theory
       This is similar to the parallel universe theory, with some minor
       differences.  The idea of infinite universes still holds true, but
       the concept of "macrocosm-microcosm" comes into effect.  What that phrase
       refers to is the oneness of everything.  If you know how a hologram
       works, you'll be on your way to understanding this new belief.  A
       hologram reflects images in 3D.  An interesting characteristic of
       holographic plates though, is that when you shatter one, each piece
       still shows the whole picture.  The *whole* picture is stored in every
       tiny fragment of the hologram.  With one minute particle of the
       hologram you could reproduce the entire picture, in 3D.  Take that
       principle and apply it to our universe, and you'll start to appreciate
       the validity of these newfound perception's on life.  

    9. Synchronicity.
       I thought I would put this in here.  Some of you may have heard of it,
       are familiar with the principles of synchronicities (The term was
       originally coined by Jung).  Those who are not, have at the very least,
       had one experience with it.  A synchronicity is kind of like a bizarre
       coincidence.  Sometimes it is more easy to recognize.  For example,
       lets say you learned a new word at school one day;  you'd never heard
       this word used ever before.  That night you hear it twice on TV, then
       the next day the book you're reading has the word in it.  Most people
       would hopefully see the "coincidence" in that experience.  I am telling
       you it is not a coincidence, but actually a simple example of the
       forces at work in our universe.  Synchronicities occur because true
       information exists beyond the physical world.  Every thought, every
       word you say has its own electromagnetic reality.  The reoccurrence of
       the word is nature's way of telling you "Wake up!  Life is incredible!"

"A Few Simple Questions":


        There are those around us that are ignorant and lost,
        That won't offer an opinion, no matter what the cost.
        They turn a deaf ear to the most logical suggestions.
        They are too scared to answer a few simple questions...

                    "A Few Simple Questions"

        Big Brother and his cameras are all over the place,
        tracking all motions, and recording your face.
        Why is our right to privacy dead?
        In the name of crime, which the frail people dread.

        Why are those in power always suspicious,
        assuming that we are doing something malicious?
        And yet in their integrity we are told to trust?
        Ignoring their scandals, kickbacks, and lust?

        Who are the victims of "society's" greed?
        The hungry and tired, the people in need.
        What do the affluent say with great glee?
        "By making them suffer, there's more for me."

        Why is that when good workers are fired,
        the stock market bulls its way higher?
        Do you feel this practice is sick and depraved?
        For man is not a commodity or slave!

        Why do most people put up with corruption?
        Not seeing that it leads to destruction.
        Maybe it is because they are gullible and naive?
        Or is it perhaps they just don't want to believe?

        Do you believe in everything you've been taught?
        Never to question, or have a free thought?
        To make you conform, they will wash your brain.
        Your only defense is to go against the grain.

        Don't those that have absorbed "society's" goals,
        realize that they've given up their souls?
        They are like ants in a colony, or an expendable soldier.
        Unquestioningly following every edict and order.

        For those honest men whom believe in what's right,
        must find their deep courage, stand up, and fight.
        Will virtuous free thinkers answer the call,
        before this diseased "society" imprisons us all?

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Vicious Closing Comments:

With large networks, new types of systems and new technology emerging rapidly,
we have the opportunity to learn and do more than the early hackers and phreaks
ever dared dream of.  They were only limited by what was at their fingertips.
However, the only limit that we have is our minds.  There have been massive
changes in h/p since the 1970s and 80s but the basics remain the same.  There
has been an influx of newbies, an internet explosion (FTP, Web Sites, IRC
channels, newsgroups etc.), faster systems, modems, more operating system and
software choices etc. and countless other changes directly relating to hacking
and phreaking.  The only constant is that there are still many people involved
in the h/p scene... and that will never change.  In fact, there's more h/p
support and better distribution than ever before.  Information is easily
accessible.  Plus, there are more Unix systems now than in the past, with ISPs
popping up all over the place.  I've heard newbies bitching, crying and
complaining about "not BBSing in the early days of h/p when everyone shared
information, text files, codes etc."  Haha.  They don't even realize that much
more information is available to them right now than what existed back then.
Newbies can leech from the internet (for free), h/p boards (no ratio) etc.  They
can read text files and magazines that were written by h/p groups from all over
the world... and they don't even have to phreak to be able to download them.
There is a tremendous difference between "now" and "then".  Newbies can now
leech some excellent utilities that weren't previously available or distributed
worldwide.  In 1998, we have systems that are powerful enough to use decryption
programs etc. without taking days to complete the task... as an example.  ;)
We can even dial h/p boards via Telnet.  Technology is constantly evolving
right around us.  Don't just sit back and be a passenger that's along for the
ride.  Participate, become actively involved and contribute to the h/p scene.

Explore your mind.  Develop its power.  Experiment and discover the true meaning
of h/p.  It's an art.  You must be creative, talented and artistic.  You can't
rely solely on pure intellect, memorization or the ideas of others to learn.
You can't wait for someone else to take the initiative for you.  You shouldn't
expect others to teach you what they know.  Eliminate your linear, structured
way of thinking.  Instead of just examining objects of technology that you don't
yet understand on the surface, look closer and try to learn ways to use it
that aren't known.  Culture your knowledge like growing, multiplying bacteria.
Immerse yourself in information and absorb it through osmosis.  Then associate
with people in the scene that are enlightened and have the same level of
knowledge.  I hope that you've enjoyed reading this March issue.  If you've
managed to learn something new, that's cool.  If not, phreak off.  ;)
