		      WARNiNG: HALLMARK REdBOXES!
	     
	   Whoever the fucking lamer was who thought to use 
	   those little recorder Hallmark cards as red boxes, was dumb, 
	   when the phone hears the beeps of money dropping in, it 
	   dismisses its own tones, and the Hallmark cards respond to 
	   this tone, with an ULTRA-HIGH frequency tone, and bam your 
	   caught right there, so in a short, don't use them.
