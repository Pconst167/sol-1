      Here we are once more...almost time to get our asses back in 
      school, so this is our 'back to school' pak i guess.  We
      have expanded a great deal since our last info file, we have
      even more ld boards in our sites list...its good to expand out
      of the 610 AC.  Thanks go to The Wizard, and MeatHead for 
      making this expansion possible.  We need more writers!
      if you feel you can produce 2-4 quality texts per month
      then please apply.  Phait is also proud to add a new coder 
      to its ranks, and possibly one of the best on the scene...
      the creator of the famous door game barney splat, and the
      president of BoNG software...Ascci Express.  Also in the works
      is our PHAiTDiAL project.  A program that is a redbox/vmb scanner
      /pbx scanner/blue box/green box/etc/etc....all in one.  If and
      when it is ever completed it will be released by itself as a special 
      phait release.  ok...well leave me feedback on what you think of 
      the pak on TSN.  By the way, I changed my handle to flagg, just 
      in case you need to get in touch. My bbs will be going up soon, 
      more info on that in the future. Ive included some ansis for our 
      dist sites logins, feel free to use them.  Take care.
