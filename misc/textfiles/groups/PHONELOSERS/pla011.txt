Here's a bunch of phone call transcripts that I typed up simply because I have
no life to speak of. Most of them are actual calls, typed straight from a
cassette tape but a few are just made up, something I did to kill time on a
rainy day. The made up ones are pretty obviously made up, as they include
operator suicides and police raids on phone booths. 

By the way I have tons of cassette tapes FULL of most of this crap and more. 
If you'd like to order the actual tape or want to submit some of your own calls, 
dial 512-370-4680 voice and listen to the message, or leave your own message.

MasterRoy:
---------
AT&T: "This is the AT&T operator, may I help you?"
RBCP: "Yeah, I want to use my credit card to bill this call."
AT&T: "Please hold while I get an operator who can validate your card."
RBCP: ".........Hello?............Hellooooooooooo??....Hey, operator, what,
      you get drunk and fall off of your chair or what?"
AT&T: (Irritated) "If you'll wait just a minute, sir, I'm getting someone here
      who can validate your card."
RBCP: "Well, geez, it's taking you long enough. Don't you know you're not 
      supposed to drink on the job?"
AT&T: (New operator) "This is AT&T, what kind of card will you be using?"
RBCP: "It's a MasterRoy."
AT&T: "Excuse me?"
RBCP: "MasterRoy. You know, Master the possibilities? The universal credit
      card? No other card more accepted on the planet?"
AT&T: "You mean Mastercard."
RBCP: "Well, it's from the bank in Roy, New Mexico and they call it a
      MasterRoy. They're pretty silly people, aren't they?"
AT&T: "Could I have the expiration date, please?"
RBCP: "Yes, it's 13/97."
AT&T: "What's that?"
RBCP: "The expiration date is 13/97."
AT&T: "That can't be right, sir."
RBCP: "Well, the kid who put my card together at the Roy Bank was new and I
      think he made a misprint on my card. It's probably supposed to say 
      12/97."
AT&T: (I hear her hitting the buttons harder, as if in frustration.) "Thank
      you for using AT&T. Your call is completing."

Operator 4592:
-------------
AT&T: "AT&T, Operator 4592. How were you wanting to bill your call, sir?"
RBCP: "I want to charge it to my home phone. My number is 618-258-1160 and my 
      name is Darin McCall."
AT&T: "Just a minute......Sir, the man on the other line says that HE is Darin 
      McCall."
RBCP: "Hmmm...Maybe that's because I just picked his name at random out of the 
      phone book and I'm trying to call my friend in Austraila and bill it to 
      him."
AT&T: "You can't do that. Obviously, it doesn't work."
RBCP: "Yes it does work, actually. About every third try it seems to work. You 
      see, usually the wife will answer and she'll think it's her husband 
      trying to make a legitimate phone call."
AT&T: "You'll be caught, though, sooner or later."
RBCP: "And if the third number billing doesn't work, I'll simply use one of 
      the stolen calling cards I've obtained or perhaps a business's PBX 
      number."
AT&T: "I hope you get caught."
RBCP: "I won't. I wrote down your operator number you gave me and I know how to
      get your name from that. If you don't start being nice to me, I'll 
      charge some calls to your house. You can't stop me, you know."
AT&T: "Fuck you, you little bastard."
  
Then she hung up. I swear, some operators just have absolutely no sense of 
humor at all. I was just trying to make her job a little more exciting. I did 
feel sort of bad when I saw the news that night and found out that she had 
tried to hang herself shortly afterwards with her operator headset.                                                                             

A Little Fun Backfires:
----------------------
AT&T: "AT&T, Please deposit 80 cents for the past three minutes."
RBCP: (I take a handfull of coins and jingle them next to the mouthpiece.) 
      "You hear that? I've got all this money and I'm not giving you one damn
      cent! Hahaha!"
AT&T: "Oh, well THAT'S fine with me, I'll just bill it to the number you 
      called then."
RBCP: "Hey, go ahead, buster. I was harrassing those people anyways. I'll be
      even better if they get a bill for it.........Well...hmmm, I guess maybe
      I can give you a little money. Here's fifty cents..." (beepbeepbeepbeep)
AT&T: "Sir, it has to be real coins, not a recording. Do you want me to turn
      you in to security right now?"
RBCP: "That's not a recording, it's a red box! They're electronicly produced
      coins. Learn to tell the difference, you shmuck."
AT&T: "Okay, let me turn you in to security right now....."
SUPR: "This is the supervisor. Can I help you?"
RBCP: "Gee, that's funny. He told me that he was getting security but all I 
      get is a lousey low-life supervisor. What do you want?"
AT&T: "Sir, 80 cents."
RBCP: "Okay, here...." beepbeepbeepbeepbeep....beepbeepbeepbeepbeep...(I box
      in the eighty cents he wants.) "Oh, and here's an extra quarter just 
      because I like you." beepbeepbeepbeepbeep!
SUPR: "Those aren't real coins, sir. Do you want me to send the police over
      there right now?"
RBCP: "Yeah, sure, send the police over here. If I had a nickle for every time
      an operator threatened to send the police to me..."

Suddenly, I look up and there's a helicopter overhead with his light shinning
down on me. I turn to run toward's the shopping center but there's a few dozen
men in army fatiges with machine guns running down the side of the hill. So I
turn the other way and three local police cars are sliding to a stop, 
surrounding the pay phone. Two FCC vans pull up and about sixteen Illinois Bell
trucks follow close behind and I think, "Man, I'm surrounded. I am fucked!"

I had to destroy the evidence, so I took my modified Radio Shack tone dialer/
red box and swallowed it. After hours of grilling by the police, they finally
let me go because of lack of evidence. Later that week, every employee of
Cincinatti Bell Telephone found that their home phone services no longer 
existed. It took them days to fix it all.

MCDS: Thank you for calling McDonald's, May I help you?
RBCP: McYes. I'd like to have a 69 piece McNuggets, a McCoke and two orders of
      McFrench fries delivered right Mcnow.
MCDS: We don't deliver, sir.
RBCP: McExcuse me? I'm looking at your McAd in the McPaper and it SAYS right
      here in black and mcWhite that you McDeliver.
MCDS: Well, that's some sort of printing mistake or something.
RBCP: This is McRediculous! Let me speak to your McManager!
MCDS: Okay, please hold.
RBCP: McHurry, you McLoser.
