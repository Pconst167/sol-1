Wow, this PLA issue is going to be a doozie. As usual, longer and even more
meaningless. First of all, I want to inform everyone of the little change the
stupid bastards at the voicemail company in Austin made. They totally changed
voicemail software (no longer the easily hacked Aspin) and relocated their
offices to downtown which meant, without warning, my voicemail number changed.
This all means, of course, that my plan of having a permanent number that
wouldn't change for a long time went out the window. Even for me, being a 
"valued" customer of over seven months, they wouldn't refer the calls from my
old number to my new number. So, the new PLA Voicemail number is 512-703-8910.

I finally got my brand new shiney fridge magnet from Roy, New Mexico the other
day, direct from their gift shop! They even sent back my change (in cash) and
they sent back the stamps I had enclosed for postage. (The magnet was a little
smaller that I'd anticipated.) They also included their business card and a
receipt with a hand written note on it, "Thanks! We enjoyed doing mail order
business with you!" Thank you, Cactus Flower Gift Shop! I feel so cool...

In the past few weeks, I've been doing a lot of bbsing in the 618 (Alton, IL)
area. I don't know WHY I started calling around there, but I did and you're
about to be treated to a four part series about the total lameness of that
entire area. I encourage anyone who lives there to MOVE OUT before it's too
late! Get ready to meet the PHREEKER scene of 618... As well as the christian
bbs scene and a few hillbillies. First, we bring you the Chatterbox BBS...

That is, more or less, what you see when you log onto Chatterbox BBS. The 
ChatterBox Incident has to come first, even though all this started with the 
Hit Man incident which is next in the series. It started when Hit Man needed 
my home phone number in Texas so he asked the sysop of Chatterbox for it and 
it was given to him. Just a few weeks before all this, Zak had logged on to 
this bbs using all of my info which I had given him permission to do. The 
sysop, being extremely paranoid of everything (he's a christian), always voice 
validates everyone, so Zak was using my info so he could get an account just
to cause trouble there. Zak has a habit of using my alias when he causes 
trouble, as many sysops in 618 can testify.

A little about Chatterbox...It's run by fifteen year old, sligtly overweight
Amanda Eyer, whose goes by the alias Chatty and her DAD, Scott Eyer, who goes 
by the alias of Scott The Believer. It's one of those bbses where you're not 
allowed to say any cuss words, not allowed to express your views because they 
may differ from the sysop's and of course you're not allowed to express any 
disbelief in the existance of some guy named God. When I called there, I 
uploaded a GIF of the bible being used as toilet paper (which should be 
included in this archive, by the way) and I made some innocent little post 
about Jesus being dead.

Anyway, this didn't make either one of the sysops happy and both of them spent
the day praying and calling up all their brothers & sisters of the church to
get a group prayer for me going or something like that. It turns out that I'm
not the only courrier for satan that they've dealt with in the past. Nobody 
likes them, their both always getting harrassing mail, their bbs has been 
hacked and the user list (names & passwords) been downloaded and distributed. 

Apparently, Chatty was gullible enough to give someone the access to view the 
user list and he/she captured it and distributed it everywhere. I would 
include it in this file but it'd be pointless because all the passwords have 
been changed and if you want a user's phone number, all you have to do is 
e-mail Scott The Believer for it and he'll give it out, no problem. Oh yeah, 
that's what I was getting at. Scott gave my home voice number to Hit Man and 
this whole shebang started up. Ah, but first you have to read some private 
mail from The ChatterBox, just to get an idea of how lame they really are...
First here's an amusing piece of mail from Chucky #91 to Chatty #1, written
on Monday, July 3, 1995:

     I say well, because I tried to page you and you must be asleep.  Today was
great.  Though my work is still cut out ahead of me.  Played volleyball at 
longacre for about 4 hours had fun.  And things made me think.
     Just standing there and seeing so many people.  There were so many people 
on the courts you couldn't see the sand, it was packed.  However though there 
were tons oh people having fun, laughing [Cand screaming I noticed things. On 
one court there were around 12 blacks and no whites.  On the other court there 
were 6 whites and no blacks.  Side by side there they were all having fun, but 
not true interaction.  Each side played their games and had fun.
     Standing around I noticed there were only two watching, out of around 
about 50, that were mixing.  My and another black girl.  Every now and then I 
looked at the blacks staring at me in wonder, and I even got the sane looks 
from the whites too.  But the most beautiful thing I noticed that GOD was 
watching too.  Though I felt a bit worried that one of the two races wou

RE: DEMONCHILD

¯My name isDEMONCHILD I wish to join your bbs. 

Well, hi there. The newuser letter said that you were to give me your REAL name
here, not your handle. AND in the info about you it asked for your handle 
first, then it asked for your FULL real name, and you and your "Brother is it" 
just gave your real first name and not your FULL name. I asked Vertico to tell 
me what his real last name was, but he didn't do it. MAybe he didn't even read 
my mail, or didn't know how to answer back to me. To reply back to this letter,
when it comes to the system prompt, just hit "A" for Autoreply to the author, 
and you will be replying to my mail. ALSO, to end and send a mail, after you 
write one, just hit return (Enter) to get to the begining of a NEW line, and 
then type /S to save your mail/letter/post. If you have any questions, just 
E-mail me.

And no, I am not going to Promise Keepers. I am just not to hip to that 
movement. I think it just pumps you up, fires you up, but really don't give you
any real value for Christian Living. Case in point, Rick Taylor. Came back from
there last year, really fired up, wanted everyone to go. Then for about 6 
months I never even saw him in Church, then maybe they came once a month for 
awhile. Now look at them, up and quit the whole Church. I am just not sure PK 
is all it is cracked up to be......

¯umm.....I think it was two days ago.. you got me in chat...
¯that wasn't me it was my sister. I am not usually that hostile. Sorry if she 
¯angered you..
¯:)
¯Lestat

Well, I see you still have that line noise, huh? NO, I wasn't angry, and I 
didn't cut you off, I guess that call waiting or line noise finally got the 
best of our comm programs, cause it cut us off automatically.

No problem here, I just couldn't figure out why I was getting a ring, ring from
your phone. I should have gotten a busy signal. See, the problem is that we 
have a VERY hostile user here that we deleted a couple of months ago, and she 
is still trying to call in under fake accounts. That is why I was checking to 
see if you were calling from your phone, I am too cheap to get caler ID. :)

  [And the hostile user in question, of course, is Martini. Scott's big
   security thing is calling up a user while they're on the phone to see
   if the phone is busy, just to make sure it's really them. Since a lot
   of people don't want to tie up their phone, they get booted off when
   Scott does this. So that's what their private mail looks like. After
   I was deleted, I logged back on to ask why. Here's what I wrote and
   also the responses that I got from both Chatty & Scott The Believer.]

Title:
Enter message now, max lines are 30
Enter '/HELP' for help.
[---=----=----=----=----=----=----=----]----=----=----=----=----=----=----=--]
Why'd I get deleted? Well, maybe that's not really the issue here. What I
really want to know is why did you give out my personal home phone number?
When I first logged on here I used my real information thinking that you
wouldn't give it out to everyone but I guess I was wrong. Was I deleted
because I wasn't home when you called my girlfriend? I'm sorry, I was bbsing
at a friend's house. I had no idea that wasn't allowed on here.

I guess it'd be best if you forwarded this to Scott The Believer since he's
probably mostly responsible for all this, from what I hear. I just want you to
know that I don't appreciate any of this. It should also interest you that I
happen to have YOUR home voice number and could give that out to plenty of
people. Did you know that the guy you gave my number to threatens to fly down
here and kill me all the time? If that were to actually happen, do you think
that Scott would be legally responsible for my death? I think so.

          Welll.. For your information, I already know that you have my #...
I'm not stupid, I know who is all involved in a plot against me. But I'm not
worried. I don't apprecaite users loggin' you in as a new user ( referring to
posts made on Martini's board, oh.. You thougt I'd never see them, I have. )
and you have no clue...... Well.. I have to say I also don't think it is in FCC
regelations to give out any other users information on a post, or anything.
They are trying to contact FCC, I know this for a fact, as he is my freind. No,
He doesn't have access to my user log, and no, he won't ever. I made that
mistake once with giving a guy that info, and someone loging on as him and
getting all the info.. Alright, so if I didn't give him the #, he would have
gone and got it from someone else.... Trust me, he knows how. I'm NOT sorry I
am freinds with him. He's a nice guy, if you are on his good side, I'm just
glad I am. And I wish that Martini, and everyone else wasn't mad at me, I make
an effort to try and be nice to all of my users, but she broke a rule, and was
in violateon of FCC. I also have to add, that I let my dad handle that, so she
WOULDB'T get mad at me. I'm sorry I gave your #. And I'm sorry you were
deleted, but I was given the explination that it was because there have been
people logging in as your name. And yes we know who it was. I do read messeges
on martini's boarde.... I'm not as dum as everyone thinks.

And just how did you get that number? From our users list? Humm?
Hey, our home voice number isn't unlisted, anyone can pick up a phone book and
get it, BIG DEAL! You think you are giving out privedledged info, or something?
NOT! Having our phone number isn't anything, BUT making crank, obsene calls is
ILLEGAL, and we are getting them, so we have called the FCC in Washington to
see what can be done to go back thru the phone records and catch whoever is
making all the calls. And to trace all new incoming calls also. We will catch
whoever is responsible.

As for you being deleted, YES, I did that. For several reasons. 1: Stupid posts
you made concerning GOD. 2:Stupid GIF you uploaded. 3:hanging up on me when I
pulled you into CHAT last nught. 4:Posts you made on Martini's board asking
what you could "DO" to Chatterbox. 5: Post you made giving out Hitmans info on
Martini's board. 6: The main reason, your association with the PLA! That right
there was enough for me to delete you, I just deleted 2 other members of the
PLA from here too. As soon as you read this, you will be deleted again, and we
turned on NEWUSER PASSWORD so none of you can log back on as NEW. You are not
welcome here, your association with Martini the JERK and your stupid posts on
her board has seen to that. Good-bye and good ridence....

        [And when I try to respond, Scott chat's with me!]

Chat mode entered. You are chatting with Scott The Believer...

[ME:] I bet it'll be a major inconvience for the new users with that NUP on 
here. That's funny.

what is so funny about it?

I think you're lame. Will users still be able to log on if your phone line
were to somehow disappear? 

how will our phon line dissapear?

Oh, I don't know. If you piss off God he may disconnect service. What's so 
bad about the PLA?

I think he is getting mad now 

  [And he dropped carrier on me. Imagine that. While all this is going
   on, Apok0lyps has been coming through will flying colors, capturing
   most of these posts, getting debates and voting questions started,
   and (him being the only one with an account on Chatterbox) having
   a lot of conversations with Scott The Believer. The issue being 
   debated mostly, was did Scott have the right to give out my info.
   Here's a message that he posted on Roy's Place...]

6/7: ok..
Name: Apok0lyps #3 @1
Date: Mon Jul 31 09:13:08 1995

     I got a question for everyone. When you go to your doctor, he/she and you 
have a sacred trust called the doctor/patient relationship. This means that he 
can't/won't discuss ANYTHING about you with anyone else without your 
permission. 

     The same things go on with you and your laywer. The only persons he can 
discuss your case with is other officers of the court, and they are required by
LAW to keep what they hear a secret. 

     Now we all know that these things get broken from time to time, but at 
leaset there are penalties in place to punish those who break these trust. So 
my question is as follows: Shouldn't a sysop be bound by the same set of rules?
At least the ones a laywer uses. Your personal information is a very precious 
comoditity(sp) and when you entrust it to someone, you expect them to honor 
your trust. What should happen to those who violate those trust??

     Now stop and think of this situation: A sysop tells you you MUST leave 
correct info, and you will be voice validated. You want access to his system, 
so you comply. He KNOWS your information is correct, and you are allowed on. 

     Next, I say you are making harassing phone calls to me, so I call some 
sysops looking for your phone number/real name. I finally stumble across one 
who will tell me. I call you make threats. But the catch is you were never 
making those calls to me. I just wanted your info. It may only work once with

  [Here's a couple of replies to Apok0lyp's mail from Scott...]

(2/2): Legalities?
Pirate:  Scott The Believer #2
Date: Tue Aug 01 20:22:49 1995

Here is a legal question. RBCP called me, thinking I would answer the phone, it
was the 2nd time he had called, I did answer it the first time. BUT the second
time, I let my answering get it. BOOM, he called back in 2 minutes and played a
tape of WHAT my answering maching said, Which means he RECORDED it! And if I
had answered it voice, he would have been recording me, WITHOUT my consent.
WHAT DOES the LAW say about that, HUH? If you are advising him, you may want to
talk to him about it. I am keeping that tape for any future possible needs.
Just in case this don't just END now peaceably. I am in favor of that option,
how about you?

  [In this reply, Scott is replying to his new & improved answering machine
   greeting which goes something like this: "Hello! WARNING! This call is
   being TRACED by the phone company as we speak. (stutters) It is also 
   being recorded, copies of which are being furnished to the FCC so please
   speak clearly so we can hear every word you say...(beeeeeep!)"]

I am glad you think I can be trusted cause I am older and a Christian. I really
don't think what I did was that wrong, I am sorry it has gotten blown out of 
proportion tho. It's not like I gave the number to someone I don't know either,
I know greg, he was at my house Sunday night and picked Chatty up to play 
Volleyball. He was NOT a total stranger I gave that number to.

BUT I saw the post where you claim that HITMAN posted his address and his phone
number, and it was NOT his correct address or phone number. If you have it, 
please pass it to me, cause I don't believe it till I see it. We read all the 
posts (AND captured them) and I didn't see his correct address or phone number,
except in RBCP's post. AND I still believe he got it from MY users list. AND he
is calling up here too, against your legal advise. He listened to my answering 
machine, AND then posted what my machine said on Bogus Journey. that is really 
lame, he IS calling my house and Greg also. All I can say is that it had better
not go on much longer, or I am calling the police. This is the stupidest thing 
I have ever seen. In all my years of BBSing, I have never seen such babies 
trying to cause trouble. AND RBCP posting my mail to him and my CHAT MODE with 
him on Martini's board is just as lame, BUT I guess that is legal too, huh? 
Maybe I should just go post ALL the PLA's phone numbers and address's in open 
posts on all the board I can, huh? That would be fun, right? yea. AND that post
about Satans BBS, 2 gigs of Adult files, then MY VOICE number, that just about 
takes the cake. I want to know if you think this whole mess is about to END or 
it is really going to take calling the police in to end this stuff? What do you
think? Is it about over? What do you think will end it? Just want your thought 
on this issue.....

(2/2): Wow,
Pirate:  Scott The Believer #5
Date: Sun Jul 30 23:48:18 1995

I guess this thing with Martini not liking the Chatterbox and Amanda, and the 
fact that she forced us to delete her from this BBS has finally gone over the 
edge. Whatever Greg did, it did NOT warrent the PERSON who stole our users list
to post his information in an open post for all to read. That is going WAY too 
far in my opinion, and very may well be illegal. I am sure the harrasing phone 
calls are illegal. Anything I could do to help him get to the bottom of it, I 
would have done for anyone including you if someone did that to you. AND I HOPE
he does get to the bottom of it, and the police catch the person responsible. 
In the meantime, let me say this. I will try to keep your info as secure as 
possible, but I can't guarntee your privacy. If the same situation came up, but
he had needed your phone number to call and see if it was you or a faker that 
had done that, I would probably give him your number for him to call and get to
the bottom of it all. I can NOT guarentee that I will never give your number 
out, it would depend on the situation. So if you want to stay on, it is ok, and
if you want us to delete you, thats ok too, no hard feelings either way. But I 
can't tie my hands by promising something that I can't keep. I will just say 
that I will try to not give your info out, it would have to be a good reason 
for me to do that. So you let me know what it is to be, and we will take care 
of it. We almost shut the board a few weeks ago because of user problems, and 
that is still a possibility, so it may not matter anyway, huh?

(1/1): Humm...
Pirate:  Scott The Believer #5
Date: Tue Aug 01 06:17:59 1995

what about closed systems that only allow certain people access? How do they do
that? Are you saying we MUST allow anyone on as a user, weither we want to or
not? If I called Martini's board, she would be required to let me on as a user?
I don't know about all those legalities, yes, If I refused to let someone on
just because they were Black or Japeneese, I would probably be sued for it. BUT
I do know that RBCP was deleted for posts and actions he did here, for his
attitude about this board. ZAK and Zensless1 both TOLD me to delete them unless
I could guarntee then 100% security, that I would NEVER EVER let out their
info. They asked me to delete them if I could not guarntee that, so I did
delete them at their request. You on the other hand, I have NEVER had a problem
with, so even tho you are PLA, you are welcome here. I only delete a user that
I have a real problem with and then only after I warned them about it. But you
don't have to worry, I have had NO problem with you.

But I would like to know one thing. Why is it so wrong for me to give out a
to post a users info like he did in an open post? Where did he get that info
for one thing? And why is it ok to post that in an open post, yet I get raked
over the coals for giving out 1 phone number to 1 user? What about systems that
have 20 co-sysops, that all have access to the users list? So would it have
been alright if I just made hitman a co-sysop, and gave him access to ALL the
users info? I just don't understand this, it is beyond me how everyone thinks I
did something wrong. I see nothing wrong with what I did, BUT I see all kinds
of wrong with RBCP posting info in a post. I just don't get it....

(1/1): Redbox...
Pirate:  Scott The Believer #5
Date: Mon Jul 31 06:22:53 1995

Well, there is other factors that you don't know yet about Redboxchilipeper. We
have always considered his account VERY suspicious. Calling from texas, then he
wouldn't give us his voice number to validate him for NOTHING 2 months ago. so 
we deleted him then. NOW 2 months later he calls and freely gives us his 
number. I heard he posted a post on Martinis board asking what he could "DO" to
the chatterbox BBS. Yesterday, he called our board, made some rather rude post 
concerning GOD, saying he is dead, etc, Uploaded a GIF showing a toilet with 
the Bible being used as toilet paper, knowing we are Christians, he was trying 
to get under our skin, IF IT WAS EVEN HIM CALLING. See, we still consider his 
accound a possible fake account. While he was on-line, I called his data phone,
busy. BUT immediatly when we broke contact, it was still busy. Was it him, 
possibly not. So I called his voice number, got his wife. She said RBCP wasn't 
home, and that he does all his BBSing from his house, so it wasn't him, but 
someone else calling in using his name. Probably the same person who stole out 
user list. when he was on-line, I pulled him into chat too, as soon as he saw 
that I was wanting to talk, hd immediatly hung up on me. NOW after all this 
went on, then hit-mans story about redbox posting HIS info in a post, hey, I 
didn't feel very concerned about keeping his phone number private. AS a matter 
of fact, I deleted him from our system. And I really don't feel bad about 
giving Hitman his phone number, sorry if you feel I did the wrong thing.

As for our user list being an inside job, you are partially correct. We think 
it was ripped off by "A Girl" who started dating a Guy. This guy was on our 
board, good friend of Chattys, and had a 255 access. She had several friends 
who she had given 255's to. well, this Girl logged on as this Guy, cause she 
had found out his password to get onto the system. Once on as him, with a 255, 
she got the users list. Simple as pie. NOW NOBODY has a 255 but Chatty and me. 
And we have proof that they were calling in as other people, using our users 
list to log in as whoever they wanted to, and stir up trouble. Heck, they even 
tried to log in as ME and Chatty, using our Passwords that were ONLY in that 
users list, except we changed them. I tell you what, weither we shut this bbs 
down or keep it running is still up in the air. How far hitman's problem goes 
may deceide that for us. AND we have also been getting phone calls at Midnight,
and 3 AM, hang-ups, alot of them, and we are thinking of calling the phone 
company and let them trace them. This whole thing is really stupid, and my wife
has had about al that she will take of this crap. It might turn ugly, who 
knows. But I still say that I can't promise total security for your info, but I
will use my discression as to who would get it, and it would have to be a darn 
good reason, fair or not?

   during all the conversing, Apok0lyps convinced Scott that perhaps a

    Ok, after some masterful calls, I convinced STB that the harassment should
stop, provided he APOLOGIZES to you and the PLA, and also agrees to NEVER give
out a users info without that users consent. 

    Now, if you ask me, I think Scott has seen the error of his ways 
(halajueia brother, ok I can't spell it) and should be left alone. But good 
ole Greg.....well, he (IMHO) could apologize all day and get no mercy. 

    It was cool, I told STB that he would most likley get harassed day and 
night for a long time unless he said sorry. He figured it would "just go away 
in time" but I told him all about Chris Tomkinson and he then replied with 
"well, what do you think I should say in this apology?" :) He was gonna mail 
it to you on Roy's Place, but I told him a PUBLIC POST on his board would be 
much better. It's in you xfer section. CYA

Chatty and I want to apologize to Redboxchilipeper for what went on this week. 
We gave out his home phone number to another user, and being new sysops didn't 
realize that we were doing a great injustice. Looking back, we see that we 
should NOT have given it out, and we will never give out any user info without 
their consent FIRST. Of course our user list had been hacked and is all over 
the area anyway, we didn't think it was that bad a thing to do. BUT we are 
sorry this happened, and we will never do that again. Hope this satisifies the 
PLA, RBCP, and anyone else who had doubts about our security. As of NOW, Chatty
and I are the ONLY 2 who have access to the user list, and it will remain that 
way. Security will be tight from now on.

Sorry RBCP........

  [My reply to it...]

Fine, apology accepted, and a good move on your part, as well as mine, I 
guess. I suppose that I'll apologize for the anti-religeous comments and GIFs
I uploaded to your system then. I promise you that I will make a point never
to call your bbs or your voice number again. From everything I've heard, 
though, a lot of people don't like you because you're both so big brotherish
about the way you run your bbs, so if you receive annoying calls, be assured
that they're NOT from me or Zak or any other member of the PLA.

One thing I think you didn't realize while rattling off my unlisted home 
phone number was that Mr. Carson who's such a fine citizen on your bbs, has
been threatening to fly down to Texas, find me, rape my girlfriend and shoot
me. While I know he's probably all talk and in reality works the graveyard
shift in a crappy motel, that's not exactly the type of person I want having
my phone number. The day after you gave it out, Greg started calling me and
threatening me every time he received a prank call. I hate to break this to
Greg, but I'm not the only one who hates him. Anyway, I'm rambling, have a
nice life without me in it anymore. You should take off that NUP because 
that's really a hassle for legitimate users and I heard some weirdo a few 
years back got nailed to a tree for suggesting a NUP.
                                        Peace,
                                        RBCP

  [And that's more or less the end. The next day I called up Bogus Journey,
   one of the few cool boards in 618, to see this public post by Chatty.

  [Sometime during all this Zak, who at the time still had a valid account
   on Chatterbox, left feedback to Scott saying, "Somebody just called my
   house and hung up on me! Can I have your user list?" and he got deleted
   for it. Also, a few other users (Zenzeless?) were deleted because they
   told Scott if their security couldn't be guaranteed on that system, 
   they didn't want accounts there.] 
   
I really meant what I said about not bothering Scott anymore, by the way. 
Since he was smart enough to make a public apology, I suppose I can respect 
that enough to leave him alone. He will continue to be harrassed daily, 
though. Not because I'm encouraging or doing it myself, but because of the way 
he treats people who call there. There's nothing I can do about that. So 
Scott, lighten up a little. As Colleen Card keeps pointing out to me, Scott 
didn't apologize because he was sorry, he apologized because he was being
harrassed and wanted it to stop. Oh and if anyone ever wants to give the 
Chatterbox BBS a call to talk about good, wholesome, christian and family 
values, you can reach their bbs at 618-277-8040. And of course you shouldn't 
ever harrass these people because they have the power of the lord behind him. 
And although I would never give out their home voice phone number in a mag
that's distributed nationally, you could probably dial 618-555-1212 and ask
directory assisstance for Scott's number in Belleville and they would give it
to you, but I wouldn't encourage that either.

In the above section you heard alot about a guy named Greg Carson aka The Hit
Man and how he was so hard up for my home voice number. (It's been awhile, by
the way, and he still hasn't used all of his amazing resources and money to
get my new phone number.) About 75% of the 618 users don't like Greg. It 
started in a post where he started going off about how much money he had, how
nice of a house he had and the nice cars and job he had. I THINK that's how it
all started, I'm not really responsible for this war, I just contributed a lot
to it. I never got around to doing a public records search to see if he really
owned all these amazing toys or if his rich daddy just bought it all for him.
Of all the posts to lose, I lost that one and I'm too lazy to go look for it,
but here's a bunch of other posts to give you an idea of the whole story. Keep

I don't know why he thinks he is so cool... Oooooh wow, a $60,000 house, 
yipee, our house cost $220,000.  He's probably just trailer trash bull 
shitting his way around to boost his ego.  Most likely he has low self esteem 
and calling people childish names, and other frivolish words makes him feel 
strong, so just let him do his little thing.  People get their kicks in 
awkward ways.  Although his isn't awkward, it's just flat out pathetic.  Hey 
hit man, you should go to this party coming up on Saturday, then see how tough 
you are...  It's just an invitation, not a threat.

What did I do? I just would like to hear it from your own words,
Please be honest-dont say because your an Asshole, Fuckhead...etc
I want to know what I did! Why are YOU so mad, or maybe your not mad
but what did I do that was so bad? I did not brag, everyone was telling

that? 

Wheres the party? My dogs are tough tho, but a gun does do a better job!
Wheres the party? no one will tell me!

You guys want to know how much of a man hit man really is?   He says, go 
ahead, i'd like to see you fuck with me.  Then everyone fucks with him, and he 
runs to the police or FCC who ever and crys.  No only that, but he is so much 
of a man, he had his wife call my house.  Not him his WIFE.  HAHAHAH, that's a 
real man if I've ever seen one.

37/39: crys
Name: The Hit Man #27
Date: Sat Aug 05 12:31:04 1995

I wasnt crying, My wife called you on her own! I wasnt even there. 
See I want you to realize something-Every action has a reaction!
Did you think I would stand by and do NOTHING! I dont have anything against
the PLA or anyone of you BBSers. You did something and I did something.
I am not going to do anything else, I should act my age and not bring myself
so low. Yes I was being immature. So what-You are doing the same thing,
but thats not right, I will stop and I have stopped. I just want you all to
 realize that. 

C-ya

38/39: No..
Name: Martini #1
Date: Sat Aug 05 20:51:41 1995

I wasn't being immature.  I was not pranking you, or chatty or whoever.  I 
don't know how your lovely wife even got my number, I don't know why your wife 
even had anything to do with me.  Of course she didn't.  But I think she's 
very manly.  Especially when she hung up on me.

39/39: She isnt here
Name: The Hit Man #27
Date: Sun Aug 06 07:39:34 1995

Shes not here to defend herself but I dont know what went on. Whatever 
happened already happened. Its over, who cares. Life goes on. 
-She told me you hung up on her- Whats it matter Martini-forget it

33/34: ok Let me clear some things up now
Name: The Hit Man #27
Date: Sat Aug 05 12:20:08 1995

The people I saw on welfare where drinking outside there house and would
be up at midnight drunk walking the streets. NOt everyone on WElfare is
doing it but some are. Another thing I did work for a farm(Keller farms)
and would 10 hour days. Horse Radish fields, hay bails, etc... Also
I know what hard work is! I was in A Bootcamp for 4 months where I chopped
down trees for 8 hours-I got blisters at first but not after a few weeks
of it. Hard work got me to where I am today! Making you all mad was that
one part I still need to work on, I like pissing people off and it is
a part of me I dont like, It may 

34/34: It may
Name: The Hit Man #27
Date: Sat Aug 05 12:22:39 1995

Getting too long....It may have something to do with my job, Always being 
nice and hearing people bitch all the time but I am who I am. 
Well I guess I will talk to you later. C-YA


   [Notice a slight change in attitude from just a few weeks. You can feel
    him beginning to break down... For some reason, Hitman kept e-mailing 
    me as unknown. Here is a poor attempt at an apology by him in private 
    e-mail on Bogus Journey...]

(1/1): No Im sont
Name: >UNKNOWN<                                          
Date: >UNKNOWN<                                           

I mean no Im not! If someone came to my house they would be, but I never
threatened anyONE! I want to say Im Sorry for whatever I did to YOU
RBCP- Im sorry-ok-Im not looking for anything in return but I just want you
to understand that I guess Im just too GOOD at the BASHING SUB-
Boy did I piss somepeople off just by bashing them on a BASHING SUB!

Well I guess I will talk to you soon.

C-YA

  [He's not sorry, he's just sick of us harrassing is co-workers. 
   And my reply...]

[---=----=----=----=----=--=----=----]----=----=----=----=----=----=----=----]
Private annonymous e-mail isn't good enough. A public post, preferably on 
Martini's BBS, at LEAST one paragraph long and apologizing not only to me, but 
Martini, the PLA(H) and everybody else you threatened.



40/40: so the hit man decides to finally call back...
Name: Redboxchilipepper #11
Date: Sun Aug 06 09:26:18 1995

I thought he'd just contiune to be sneak and fool us by calling in as the 
Pepsi Man, but I guess not. It certainly is amazing how his attitude towards 
us has changed in just a few weeks. He can be as nice as he wants to now, but 
I still remember the posts that said, "FUCK YOU BABIES! Bring it on, I'll 
fucking shoot you all! You're all talk! You'll never do anything. You'll never 
get my info. I'm flying down to Texas to kill you both!" Hmmmm, should I show 
mercy? I think not. Have a nice life, Hitman. You know you're lucky that the 
Ameritech office is so busy lately and I'm too impatient to sit around on hold 
for you. But just wait... You made a major mistake.
 
Perhaps a public apology, a few paragraphs long, similar to STB's would change 
my mind...

49/50: My conversation with Mrs. Hit Man.
Name: Martini #177 @6851
Date: Mon Aug 07 01:41:29 1995

Mrs. Hit Man: I have a proof that you've been pranking me, blah blah blah, 
hacking bbses blah blah blah, 42 calls have orginated from your house telling 
me that my husband will pay, blah blah blah.
Martini: go to hell
Mrs. Hit Man: OH that's it, I'm calling the FCC NOW! (click)

It was amusing.

50/50: who has 42 calls
Name: The Hit Man #370 @6851
Date: Mon Aug 07 17:24:22 1995

I will not go to your level and prank you! If(And I am Saying IF)
I did anything it would be to go to your house and shit on your face!

Again it IF I did anything witch I wont-YOu are not worth my time anymore
ok Budweiser! Hasta Manana

Enter message now, max lines are 60
Enter '/HELP' for help.
[---=----=----=----=----=----=----=----]----=----=----=----=----=----=----=----]
Nope, that's not it, Hit Man. It's not that you don't want to go down to her 
level, it's just that you know whatever you do will come back on you 100 times
worse. That's really it, isn't it? You know, for supposedly being 21, you're 
not that bright.

  [Finally, on August 7th, he called my bbs under the false alias of 
   Marlboro Man and we got to chat, face to face...]

ME: Why?

HM: I have no reason-just wanted to ask what yoyu where talking to me about
    earlier when I couldnt respond

ME: I was just trying to annoy you but you put me on hold on two lines at 
    once. That's never happened to me before.

HM: I am sorry it gets busy around here-like right now I am on the phone with
    one of my guests

ME: I could help you! I'll forward all of your calls somewhere else so 
    somebody else can answer the phone for you. Deal?

HM: Well I cant do that then I will lose alot ob business

ME: No you won't, I'll talk to your customers for you! I'll get things
    straigtened out over there.

HM: Ok sure no really I wish I could but it wouldnt be good, 

ME: Well, I like surprising people and maybe I'd do it anyways just as a 
    surprise to help you..

HM: Wow you will help me-WHY? 

ME: I'm a nice guy.

HM: I am sure you are-but I got the wrong impression then-I thought you didnt
    like me?

ME: Of course I like you. I just think you should go public with a big apology 
    to everybody and that would settle everything!

HM: Well I am not the only one that should be apoligizing then, What about all
    the bullshit eveyone else said,  I was only responding back to them

ME: Well, how about a big public apology to me then for threatening to fly 
    down to Texas and rape my girlfriend and shoot me?

HM: Ok I am sorry about that=-I went balistic for a min. That was over the 
    phone

ME: I know it's over the phone I still have the recordings. Anyways, I was 
    saying a PUBLIC post apology and I might leave you alone, just like Scott.

HM: You have me email-why not post it-You must have captured it

ME: Of course, but it wouldn't be as personal.

HM: ok I gotcha I will apologize to you personally, it wasnt a cool thing to 
    do but as for everyone else they need to apologize to or I will just stop
    its over and done with but I will apologize to you public to show no hard
    feelings

ME: On Martini's bbs too. And the other people who've bothered you have 
    nothing to do with me. They can prank you, but I can send your calls to 
    Sweeden or turn off your line or ship toilets COD.

HM: I understand-pranks are no big deal I have *69 or traceing going on, wont
    work for you since your out of state but I can deal with it, I will say
    sorry to you and to your girlf=riend- also how did youu know this acout 
    was me?

ME: It was quite obvious. But the dead givaway was when you accidentally used 
    the password UBITCH one day.

HM: oh yes I remember, well I have so many I didnt know what I used, Good 
    memory how did you know that password, Martini TOLD YOU- SEE that is 
    bogus-for real

ME: What's bogus? I have sysop access there.

HM: Nevermind, I didnt know that, Nvermind- I see you got your own sub now

ME: Of course, I made it myself this morning out of boredom. I have to go 
    wax my shoes now.

  [Looks like he was about to go off about sysops giving out personal info
   and try to say I'm no better than Scott The Believer until I told him I
   had sysop access there. UBITCH is the password he used on Cocktail Lounge
   and he accidentally used it on his fake account on my board so that's
   what he was talking about there. A mere 15 minutes later, I called 
   Martini's BBS to find the following public post...]

Name: The Hit Man #27
Date: Mon Aug 07 20:21:13 1995

I want to apoligize to RBCP and his girlfriend for some things I said over the 
phone.  I was having a bad day I guess and will publicly say IM Sorry. Also I 
want to say Sorry for some of the things I said to RBCP over posts. The 
Bashing got pretty heavy and I think it got out of control. 
Talk to you all Later

  [Here is what I replied with...]

[ÄÄÄÍÄ-ÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄÄÍÄÄÄ]
Ha, what a dork. He thinks it's that easy just because it was for Scott The 
Believer. That little chat session you had, Hit Man, was with my eight year 
old little brother and I beat him up for making you think that'd I'd actually 
ever leave you alone for a minute. Wait, I don't have an eight year old little 
brother so that must have been me. 
 
Nah.... I don't thinkthat apology sounded very sincere. I think not. Nope, Hit 
Man, you're in for a life of misery. Sorry, no soap. Maybe next time you won't 
be so stupid. I'll upload a copy of my chat log with Hit Man in it and the 
funny e-mail he sent me on here after he wrote this message so everyone else 
can enjoy it, too. He actually asked me to erase his info from when I posted 
it awhile back. Hmmmm, let me see if I can figure out the commands to do that.

  [Then, just to be mean, I accidentally post that ANSI again with all of 
   his personal information on it. When I had first logged on there, I had
   gotten the this mail from Hit Man...]

(2/2): ok I got one request

Please Delete my info posted on the 2 subs(or anywhere else you posted it)

The HIt Man

  [And the Hit Man story has ended. Not exactly a good apology compared to
   Scott The Believer's, but hey, he tried, right? I really have no 
   intentions of spending all my free time bothering this guy so Hit Man, 
   don't worry about me unless I get REALLY bored. Apology not accepted, I
   just have better things to do. It's hard to believe all this shit happened
   in just a few weeks... (Five bucks says nobody is still reading this

  [Feel the cheese, feel the lameness of this total wanna-be phreaker bbs. I
   ask you, what kind of real phreak bbs voice validates their users?? I've
   bbsed all over the country, seen just about every level of lameness you
   can imagine, but this is absolutely the worst "phreak" bbs I've ever come
   across, even worse than my own. And the sad thing is that I had a hard
   time getting access to it and I finally had to resort to using a fake 
   alias. A few years ago I had called this board when it was called The
   Hacker's Union and it was sort of lame back then but at least the sysop
   didn't try to mislead everyone into thinking it was a big-time hacker bbs.
   The sysop's name is Phillip Wool, alias Mr. Hack aka LXVXN and totally
   not liked by pretty much the entire 618 area code. I was at one time 
   last year) considered a "good citizen" but just to see if I could stir 
   things up, I left Zak a piece of e-mail on his bbs:

Attr : Read
To   : Zak #19
From : Redboxchilipepper #59
Date : Sat Dec 10 1994 02:22 pm PST

Hey, Zak, I think I've just about had it with this board. First, the sysop, Mr.
Hack starts hacking the users' accounts and now he's switching to lame VBBS and
not giving you access. Mr. Hack's lame questions about ESS are more than
annoying. I think maybe I'll call the Ameritech billing office there and shut
off his line, his parent's line and his grandparents line. Then I'll blow up
his house. Gee, I hope he's not watching right now. Man, this is about the
lamest, wanna-be hacker board I've ever seen in my life. "Hey, RBCP, keep
uploading those k-k-k-k-kool text files 'cause you seem to know what you're
talking about" Stupid Mr. Hack. Let's set his dad's car on fire. A wire from
the back tail light into the gas tank does wonders.

Oh well, talk to you later. I'll probably call back this lame board again
tomorrow just for the comic relief. Later! *RBCP* Roy!

   [Heh, looking at the date in that mail, I realized that I wrote that
    mail while I was in Austin, Texas from one of the pay phones in the
    airport. A few months before, while I was living in Portland, Oregon,
    Zak had called up the phone company and ordered Call Waiting on Mr.
    Hack's board line. Normally a sysop (even a stupid one) would figure
    this out within a day, but it took Mr. Hack over a MONTH to realize
    what someone had done. Even with all the users, including myself, 
    sending him pissed off feedback asking why we always get hung up on
    when we call. It wasn't until his phone bill arrived with that extra
    monthly charge on it that he figured something wasn't right. After he'd
    figured out that I'd turned on him, he deleted me and blacklisted my
    alias from his board so I send him netmail from another system:

[============================================================================]
Hi Mr. Hack!

Hey, did I ever tell you that I'm thinking of becomming a psychic? Let me try
this out on you...I predict a horrible twisted fate on your fone line. It will
happen soon and would have already happened but somebody has been too busy
lately doing other bad things....I'm pretty good, eh? I should get my own 900
number? Better yet, get YOU a 900 that I could have access to and you can't.

*RedBoxChiliPPepper*

  [Right after I wrote that, he e-mailed Andromeda (the sysop of Bogus 
   Journey) and asked her if he could have all of the personal info she
   had on me. She was amused by this and forwarded the mail to me. After
   all that I kind of lost touch with the whole Mr. Hack thing until just
   last month when someone told me that he was "wanting to get Zak and
   RBCP because they're always making fun of me." (I don't think this
   issue is going to make him too happy then.) So here's what Mr. Hack's
   new & improved phreeker board looks like. We'll start with the user
   list...]

Hi, I'm calling you from highland. I'm looking for files called PLA because I 
heard there was some sort of story on highland in there. Have you heard of it? 
Do you know how to get axcess on Roy's place? The sysop there wont give me
axcess but i don't know why. He seems like a dick. I'm really into the 
phreaking thing and i used to hhack but lost my phhone line and hhaven't much
gotten into it lately. so i'm sort of behind the times. I have a recording of
pay phones tones that lets me get free calls on some pay phones in town, but 
not all of them.
 
hhmmm, what else? Not much, I'm 20 years old and looking for contacts, I guess.
do you know a way to dial long distance for free? I think this call costs money
from highland, but I'm not sure about that one. Also, have you ever heard of
me? I haven't bbsed in over a year and I mostly called Fantasy Island and Tower
of power. I don't know of any other hpvac boardrs. there's NO bbses in 
Highhland. it really sucks here. I don't have many warez, just a few games but
they're not exactly 0day. I'm more interested in getting to know the switching
systems in your town. Ours is lame, very old and outdated but at least we have
caller I.D. (before you guys even did!) ha! catch ya later!
 
ohh one more thing...I have lots of anarchy/hhack/phreak files that I got from
a board in st. louis awhile back. They're sort of old but could be good for
historical purposes if you want.

  [I tried to go for the innocent, good guy type of attitude. Soon after I
   logged on he broke in for chat (always home, go figure!) and started 
   asking me questions about myself. He said before I was validated he'd have
   to talk to me voice and I told him that I'd tapped into the line of the
   hair salon downstairs and was using their line so he couldn't call me
   voice and the dork actually believed me! I turned on the capture file
   half way through the chat so here's more or less what was said...]

(chat mode with Mr. Hack, already in progress...)

I think it's because i'm actually in GTE territory and we're on an old crappy 
switch still. I heard you guys got upgraded a couple years back but I didn't 
hear which kind of switch. Do you know if it was 5ESS?

Yes, I believe thats it! YOu seem to know of phones fairly well, am I speaking
to a phreek?

   [Of course, he has no idea about anything to do with switches, he's just 
    read about the 5ESS in all his "anarchy files" and recognized the name.]

But of course. I really haven't been into it for a long time. my friend 
started my interest because he had a blue box that really worked but they're 
trash now. I have a tape recording of red box tones that I use all the time 
for LD from pay phones. (it's loud but it works!)

I can't get a tape recorded tone to work, but when you drop a quarter in the 
phone with the volume up all of the way, you can here the CHirP!-CHiRP-CHiRP-
CHirp-... I swear!

Yeah, it's like that on a few phones around here. you're not supposed to be 
able to hear that but you do. 

I tried building a redbox with a tone dialer, but phucked up when soldering, a
and now I have a 15.00 peice of-crap-tonedialer, and a boken 6.5536 MHz 
crystall.

  [This guy actually bought the $15 model?? Good luck with those nickels!]

Those actually work? I heard about those but thhought the article was bullshit. 
you could just put the tone dialer together and say it doesn't work and they'd 
probably give you a new one.

Problem is, everything is on a computer.. they'd send it back, see that it had
been tampered with, then give me a call. I wouldn't get away with it. My 
phriends think I'm paranoid. my being paranoid will save my back! I mean, you 
can't live dangerously forever.

True, better paranoid than caught.  Like uh, you could buy a new one under a 
false name and take THAT one back. I dunno, just buy a new one a try again i 
guess.

Oh. well, I am probably John Q. Mostpopularcustomer at radio shaq. They like 
for me to come in, cause I always buy a shitload of expensive electronics.

  [I almost lost it right there. I just wanted to tell him right there that
   he was stupid, but I held back. He finally decided that since I'm so
   "knowledgable" about them phone, he'd give me access to see the messages
   and to download those froody PLA files I'd heard so much about. My main 
   concern was finding a lot of posts that I could capture and laugh at but 
   nobody posts there. Well... there's a few that are worth seeing, but not 
   much. Each sub had a total of about five posts. The only sub that had a 
   lot of messages in it was the System Announcements sub. So here they are. 
   To conserve space, I took out most of the indents, spaces and signatures.]

To   : All
From : Kermit #21
Date : Sun Jul 30 1995 12:07 pm CDT

you need
1)a ladder
2)a axe

make friends (suck up like hell) with the sysop. so much that he either gives
tou his address or invites you over. a while later, keep track of when his
family member and him leave.
watch the house untill they all leave.
as soon as they leave, use the ladder to klimb into one of the windows.
if his room is in the basement, go through the upstairs window anyway( it's
funner that way) now, go into the room where he keeps his computer(S)
and HACK EVERYTHING WITH THAT BIG AXE (computers,moniters,MODEM,disks his cosz
chair ect.) then
go home and call the bbs to see if it is still running. (unless your totally
stupid, and don't know what your doing, the bbs won't work

RE: red boxing
BY: Fed Clad Madagascar to All on Fri Aug 04 1995 07:49 am

I can't get my recorded tones to work. I have used:

-Quarter.WAV
-P-80 Tone generation utilities
-Tone-dial 

and about 4 other tone generators. They won't work. I am doing it wrong, and
was wondering if anyone could explain their methods of redboxing other than
recorded tones and the tonedialer. If anyone knows where I can buy a redbox,
please post the place's number!

  [During chat, he told me how he bought a Radio Shack tone dialer and a
   crystal and tried to solder the crystal in but ended up burning a hole
   in the circuit board. I told him to go exchange the tone dialer and
   say it doesn't work and he said that'd be really stupid because they
   have his name, address and phone number on the receipt. I didn't even
   bother asking him why he didn't use false information.]

wouldn't validate me and then I went under this fake alias of Fed Clad and told
Mr. Hack that he couldn't voice validate me because I was tapping into the 
beauty parlor's line downstairs cause I didn't have my own phone and you know 
what? The idiot believed me! Anyways, I suppose I'll be deleted, oh well. Have 
fun writing your k-rad SYNDICATION. I can't wait for THAT one to come out!
 
Kermit? You're about the fucking stupidest person I've ever seen on a bbs. I 
just think you should know that. And the guy who's starting the amazing 
SYNDICATION? You're just about as bad. Phreaking does NOT mean going abround and
blowing shit up. And Mr. Hack? Can you say "call waiting?" I knew you could!

   What's even worse is their hack line at 618-397-7729...

Well, as if anyone cared, that's the rundown on what the 618 area is like. As
I said before, DON'T move there, under any circumstances! As if any of the
above three articles aren't convincing enough, it gets worse...Brent Deterding
lives in 618! That's right, DETER! Also known as the guy who's home phone
number is 618-288-9652. There are a few good bbses, though. 

Roy's Place (618-797-2339) for one. The original headquarters for the PLA and
operated by Zak aka El_Jefe. With truely great message topics such as the "Mr. 
Hack Thinks He's Sneaky" sub and "I wish I lived in Roy, New Mexico!"

Then there's the Cocktail Lounge at 618-451-8048, Martini's board, the one who
wrote those wonderful, enlightening poems about Deter & Chris Tomkinson. And
the place where the whole Greg Carson/Hit Man war started from.

A couple other good ones are Bogus Journey (618-656-7266) run by Andromeda and
Twist of Cain at 618-876-6042. I would put the 618 area bbs list here but since 
this PLA is already way too long, I'm going to leave it out. Hope you enjoyed 
these. (Who am I kidding...) Stay tuned next issue when we take a look at 
BBSing in Roy, New Mexico! (ahem...not)

Fun things to do when you call his board, or his house (If you happen to know 
how to get that number.) things to mail, things for fun. Revenage on The 
Cactus has just begun!

1. Call up his board and page him to chat. Then if he ever does chat with 
   you type in all CAPS or lower case. (Actually this would probably bug
   alot of people.)

2. Call up his house day and night and ask to borrow cans of Spam, cups of
   suger, and other stupid things that aren't funny just lame!

3. Call his house and tell him Zak is coming to visit AAAAARRRRRRGGGGG!

4. Drop by his house unexpectedly alot and time him on how fast it takes to
   open the door.

5. Mail him a HUGE box full of styrafome.

6. E-Mail him Ansi.

7. Take a few days off work to stay home and watch the Sesame Street 72 hour
   marathon. (He get's bored after the first 24 hours.)

It's been a tough one to decide, with nominees like Scott The Believer, Chatty,
and Kevin Christmas/Jack The Ripper (who is long overdue, by the way!) but
Andy Babbin has got to be the biggest idiot this side of the world. I'm sure 
that Hit Man could have made it here if I hadn't decided to dedicate an entire
article to him. Too bad, Hit Man, maybe next time...

Who Is Andy Babin and How Did He Cross Paths With PLA?:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
The whole Andy thing began when a friend was over and we were bored so he says
"Hey, let's call this girl I know...Anna!" So we give her a call but rather 
than her answering, her brother Andy answers. So I give him the usual harrass-
ment and the only part of the conversation I really remember is:

ANDY: "You know, I could shoot a chocolate chip off the tip of your penis from
       a thousand yards?!" 
RBCP: "What??"
ANDY: "You heard me."
RBCP: "Uhhh, Andy? That really wasn't that funny, I think you need to work on
       that one or something."
ANDY: "But it's true, though!"

I never did figure that one out so the next day I ask my friend in e-mail about
Andy and I get the following reply: (More of a thesis than a reply if you ask
me!)

"Andy is Anna's older brother who is like 26 and still lives with mommy and 
daddy.  Anna graduated last May with my class.  Anna believes very much in 
supernatural happenings and wishes to be a part of anything mysterious or would 
otherwise make her believe to have supersensory powers. Andy Babin is 'all man' 
in his book.  There's not a deer he can't shoot cause their ain't a gun he 
don't own.  He likes to burp, fart, drive a red and white ugly truck with a 
big camper and Anna drives an old Chevy Celebrity.  Andy is crude, obnoxious, 
and fitting of the stereotype you were exposed to by talking to him on the 
phone.  Her dad is hard core into short wave radio and her mom...well, I think 
she likes to play a round or two of that Windows Jezball and Windows Tetris 
before taking herself and Anna to Catholic church where Anna is in the choir.      
Well...that's about all the information I could think of that could in the 
slightest be possibly relevant. There is a guy named Matt in Austin that she's 
lusted after for years cause they were on the 'same wave length' and she 
regretts losing contact with him if you REALLY wanna be cruel..hehe...anyways.
I'll owe you if you really do something spectacular!" END OF MAIL.

Kind of sounds like a suped-up Dino Allsman, eh?

How Can I Get In Touch With Andy Babbin?:
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
Well, if you're not able to find Andy at your local NRA meetings, you could 
write him a letter at Andy Babin, 6702 Whitewing Dr., Corpus Christi, TX 78413 
or you could call him at 512-991-0217. If he's not home then Anna is always 
willing to talk, especially if you three-way on a 900 psychic line.

Here's an interesting news article submitted by Apotheosis of Delirium:

TRUE MORTIFICATION: AT&T mailed information on their "True Rewards"
  program to 175,000 customers. But when patrons called the printed
  toll-free number to get details, they were greeted with "Are you
  ready to get naked? If you want hardcore, uncensored, explicit sex
  now, then come and -- mmmmm -- take it!" Apparently, a printing error
  substituted AT&T's number for a phone sex number. "People have been
  calling and expressing their dissatisfaction," an AT&T spokeswoman
  noted. But not everyone is dissatisfied: "It hasn't been bad for
  business," said a spokeswoman for Amtec Communications, the company
  that provides the phone sex service. (AP) ...No, really: I'm just
  calling so I can get more frequent flyer miles.
______________________________________________________________________________

  [Here's some article I found in the Corpus Christi Caller Times...]

The classic victims of service automation are probably telephone operators. At
one time, every call required a human switch, but then, as calling volumes
surged, massive automation was required. The number of operators has dropped
to 60,000 from 250,000 in 1956 and is still dwindling; in the past 15 months
alone, AT&T Corp. has slashed its total by 25 percent. The sheer pace of
automation takes its toll. "It seems like every day they're telling us there
is something new to 'mech,'" says Addie Brinkley, an AT&T operator since 1957
in Modesto, California.
