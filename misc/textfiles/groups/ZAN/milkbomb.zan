        Milk Carton Bombs have been the joke of the past.  All text file
        typers, when they had nothing to do, tried to reinvent the
        wheel, and constantly wrote about how to make the BEST Milk
        Bomb.  This, my friends, is THE text file for Milk Bombs, from
        an expert on the subject.

        Now friends, the Milk Bomb:

]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------[

        A milk carton bomb is NOT a bomb by the definition of a bomb:
        something that blows up so hard that it causes damage in the
        adjacent areas through a strong force of small objects
        (shrapnel, etc).  A milk bomb has ONLY ONE PURPOSE - to make
        more noise that anything.  Another great aspect of a milk bomb
        is that the necessary ingredients are VERY simple to get - you
        can basically get everything from the corner drug store (my
        corner drug store is a Walgreens, so I can just pick the stuff
        up for free (grin) ).  First of all, you need an excess of
        lighter fluid - get the charcoal grill kind.  Next, get some
        wonderful push pins - the little ones with the pretty colored
        BIG tops.  With those pins, you have to remove the plastic tops
        and leave JUST the pins.  These pins are short, and sharp on
        BOTH sides.  Fill a paper milk carton up with the pins, maybe up
        to 1 tenth of the carton.  Fill the next ¬ of the carton with
        some lighter fluid.  Seal the carton with a rubber band or
        something that will hold it tight, and light it (usually a wick
        helps, but if you get bad enough cartons, the lighter fluid will
        seep through the milk carton (for some reason - milk holds, but
        lighter fluid doesn't??? Anywaysd...).  Then, well, RUN!  The
        carton will light quick, and make a huge POP! (more than that
        actually).  When you return, look where the pins went.  We've
        seen pins go up to 15 feet, and I've been poked by enough in my
        day..  Oh, btw, don't stand too close when it goes off...  You
        get pretty black ash on your nice yuppie suits...  Talking about
        yuppies, read my [0;1;32mZA/\/[0m file on why yuppies are scum!
