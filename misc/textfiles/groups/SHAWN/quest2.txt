              Remember  logging onto that certain bbs....thinking that it was
probably another PD/CD rom drive Mega-BBS?   And saying, "GOD...not ANOTHER
one of THOSE!!"  And then to find yourself answering this extremely odd logon
questionnaire?  Well, guess what?  That questionnaire held a secret to
Existence and Life as only the Valgars know it!  That questionnaire held the
question of YOUR Destiny!  Your Existence!  Your Acuality!  Your VERY SELF-
HOOD REVEALING!!  AND YOU ANSWERED IT!!!!!!

Subconsciously...........of course.

Let me continue.....you will now see the Answers to the Fnordian Question of
Existence!  Some are odd, some are weird, and some are down right sicko!  But
those that were stupid, and just a total waste of time, were deleted, and may
the souls of those who did, fry in the depth of hell until dementia rots
whatever is left of there reality into little fragments of maggot embryo
lying on some skunk carcass laying out in the middle of a road on
some planet way out in the backwaters of time and space, of your previous
existence!!  THAT will teach them a lesson to be aware and decisive during
these tests of Life!!  Fools.


              For those who did answer.....thank you I'm sure you're better
off for it.


Here are their answers!  Do with them what you will.  May you learn by them!
We wish your reality a good one.................
