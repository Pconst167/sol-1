Suddenly you are engulphed in a bright white light...
and you fall onto solid concrete..  You raise yourself from the floor and take
a look at your new enviorment.  You are in a filthy, unwelcome dark alleyway
and to make it worse, there are two as they said back in the 80's, Punk
Rockers who are looking at you with a nasty eye.
"Hey dood, what is that?"
"I don't know dood, but whatever it is, I bet it has alot of cashola to glow
like that.."
The Punk Rockers laugh and tease you, pulling out knife like objects.  Finally
they encircle you and one of the punks strike.
%5 vs. %30 Lower or equal=10
His attack misses you by far and...
%20 vs. %5 Lower or Equal=8

stabs the other punk straight in the gut.  The other punk screams in pain and
falls to the floor.  The punk is dismayed at what he has done.
The other punk revives from the terribly bleeding wound.

You frighten the paladin and he retreats..  But the snakeman isn't finished
with him..  The snakeman yells and the lizard man takes out an concealed
aqua-marine potion, places it on the ground and breaks it using his Broad
Sword.  A soft cloud of purple smoke emerges and after moments disapears into
thin air.  The Paladin is suddenly surrounded by ten lizardmen, and the
snakeman strikes the confused Paladin.
10% vs. 20% Lower or Equal=13
The Paladin swiftly dodges the Snakeman and makes an return hit..

You are dropped off and two guards escort you to Computer Man's Office.  You

You walk into the Pub, singing and dancing are abound.  People you see in here

Salamon Jack (the fishman manager of this waterhole)
Mike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, who seems to be drunk at this time.
Spermies (a bunch of sperms are eating chickens in the corner)

drinking power fuels.  He turns, and notices your Mr. Rodgers Soop Blaster,
takes a look at you..

the pond and large redwood sized mushrooms litter the enviorment.

There is a strange yellow puss substance flowing out of a crack in the ground.
You hear a low pitter patter of feet, brushes moving...
it gets louder and...
a large white rabbit jumps in from nowhere..
"I'm late, I'm late, oh doloby!  I'm late!"  and disapears in the mushrooms.
you can hear continuing pitter patter and..
a beautiful young blonde girl jumps in..
"Hello sir, did you happen to see a large white rabbit pass by here?"
You feel this is strangely familiar, as since the shroom in front of you says,
"SDB Incorporated, Dood"

30% Ego vs 2% Stupidity Lower or Equal= 0

I tell Alice to kep an Eye out for a man named Paul.  He may be carrying
a ford emblem or arear GT valiance from a 66 Mustang.  I get excited again and
run circles around Alice shouting ROR-ALUCARD!!!

    Hey, Struct dude......why don't we both just have tea AND Dinner with
Alice together?  It's much more prolific that way.

    And as we all 3 stand here chatting, I examine the the coming from the
pond.  What could it be, I wonder?


Then I get excited again that I'm here with Alice and start wagging my
tail....and I lick her face.  <smooch!>  And I whisper in Her ear:

  RoR, babe......

You approach the submarine, it submerges fully and suddenly you are attacked
by Grey Suited Ninjas!  They grab at you, knock you out with thorozine
seringes.  You fall into the submarine, and totally unconcious..

.....time passes...
..time passes..
.time passes.

You wake up, finding yourself helplessly tied up by thick titanium roping.
A large fat man wearing a general's uniform sits in front of you.
"I am General Provst of the Russia, and you my friend, are my hostage, since
of course our Communist Government has fallen, my men need morale, and you are
it.  You are a symbol of lazy democratic SCUM!"  He tells guards to take you
away.

Swifty, the guards take you to the shower room and tie you up to a chair.

A dozen guards line up in a horizantal fashion (such as a firing squad.)  Next
to them are chairs which level 10 cream pies each.

The Officer in Charge (appear to be)  points at you and laughs.

You take a look.
It seems to be a wrist watch, currently at 23:49:00.00.  You are also holding

" Your mission:  to assasinate the traitor YOKAV

He programs in the data into the small remote control-like device and places
