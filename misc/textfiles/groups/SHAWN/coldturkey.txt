 Title: argggggghhhhhhhhhh!


    I picked up the syringe and drew up the coke from the spoon, previously
burned and blackened from cooking down the junk: 20 units of pure USP (500
mgs).

    I tied myself off - I needed no one and wanted no one. I had everything I
needed and wanted and loved in that one syringe and in the plastic bag in my
pocket. My veins stood out. They were clean from eighteen months of
abstinence.

A rush. I knew what it would feel like. I could get off again. And I had
wanted this all along. I popped the point of the needle in. It was just like
it used to be. No Problem. Registering immediately. The pin prick, the
increasing power. The blood appears in the cartridge of the syringe and swirls
* psychedelically * Clear solution and deep red blood encircle each other. I
tap the plunger.

    WHAM! The Hydrochloride taste in the back of my throat. Tachycardia
ensues... Vision blurs and the top of my head shoots off in a dynamic burst of
rockets, stars, and energetic propulsion. Oh, yes; total body, mind, and soul
orgasm. Flash! Here comes that same old feeling again. Flash! Paradise. Flash!
Instantaneous burst of power and pleasure. Flash! Total intensity and
stimulation. Flash! The world in a syringe. Pure, unadulterated energy and
pleasure.

    I register again and boot it again, and again, and again. Once is not
enough. Never can I get enough. I withdraw the needle and the thick red liquid
oozes out rapidly. Pressure must be 220 over 160. Pulse up to 240 - a new
record.

    I stagger to the sink and rinse the syringe. Time is not determinable.
There might as well be no such thing. Quickly I drop 2 grains (128 mg) of
morphine (no demerol available tonight and good heroin is practically
impossible to come by these days) into the fit and draw up another 20 units of
water (shake and bake). The saccharin like tablets dissolve almost immediately.

    I tie off and jab the spike in, already beginning to rush, and fire up the
morphine. Wham! About face. Excruciating pins and needles and the
hydrochloride taste is overpowering.

    A ton of bricks on my chest. Breathing is difficult. The inevitable
arrhythmias ensue. Fear? Why not? It's all part of the web. I anticipate it.
I grab on for all it's worth. The closer I come, the more intense the
experience, the adventure, the challenge. Time is nonexistent. The nod
(drowsiness), the hallucinations. Truly a roller coaster of the most intense,
instantaneous experiences imaginable.

    The chemicals jerk you up, down, around, and inside out at a pace only
* GOD * can perceive. Excuse me while I kiss the sky - and nearly die.
