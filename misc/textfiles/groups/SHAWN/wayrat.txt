A full grown Rat can chew it's way through a foot of concrete just to get at a
few cracker crumbs on the other side.  Rats will chew through electrical
wiring, metal, and any other obsticals, dangerous or not, to get what they
want. This doesn't mean that they don't give a shit what happens to them.
Rats are well known for their stealth, and quickness of escape. You need to
fool them with poisons that look like food, or powerful traps to catch one, and
it's a rare day when a Rat is taken alive. Of course, I have shot a few that
were in my back yard, but, it always took me several rounds to kill the
bastards.
 
     In this file, i'm not really concerned with real rodents, it's the Rat
state of mind that I want to talk about, sometimes called: The Way of the Rat.
As you will see, developing this rat outlook can be quite useful at times.
 
     Have you ever seen the rain? Have you ever read Cat In The Rain? Do you
want to? Rats control the world. We control the world. Rats take this planet
for everything it's worth, we not only are filthy little pigs, but, we worship
filthy little pigs. Yes, it's true... through the networks, we really have the
power and we use it.
 
     There is no code of ethics, there is no law, there is no right, there is
no bad. Ok well that's sort of a lie. Heh. We do follow a few guide lines.
For instance, Rat's never rat!
 
     Insanity is an obselete concept. It's everywhere these days. We need more
subgroupings of insane people. Every fucking bum looks different to me. I bet
I look different to them too. "RAT" is a good seperate category from general
insanity. Sort of the Insane elite (hahah). If you're fucking twisted and
you can manage to get a computer with a modem, at least you can organize!
That's where bulletin boards come in. Special gathering sites for the most
twisted pigs around. Secret societies consisting of insane people. Do you know
what reading Alice in Wonderland over and over again will do to your brain?
It's called boosting.
 
So this manual has been put together to inform, and also to spread the
sickness. To teach The Way of The Rat, Rat philosophy, Rat theory, and all the
rest of the shit.
 
Get yourself a 12-pack of Beer, stretch out and take it all in.
