        RAT HEAD  (415)524-3649           The ELECTRIC PUB  (415)236-4380
                    The PIRATES' HOLLOW  (415)-236-2371






I sit in my little Mushroom shack.  In the middle
of a million square mile field.  A field of Daisy's.
Here I sit, and I write on my parchment.  I write with
the feather of a Flamingo that Alice has touched herself.
And I write the letter with my own blood.

My head is split in two.  Bolted down with a latch.
But I don't open it much.  I open it occaisonaly in
the Day.  And scary things happen.  One time a
giant bunny rabbit with fangs came out and

asked me if I had a Clever.  he didn't seemed to please
when I asked him why he'd want a clever, so I ran.
HAHAHAHAHA!
Ran from WHAT?
From my head of course!
Isn't that a stupid idea?  I tried.  But the Rabit followed.
So I yelled at him...
Ickflab inko blabber blabo wham bam thika thang!
And his eyes widened to the size of Coconut cream pies
(this was a HUGE Rabbit!)  (Big) (Flago!)

      Boy.....what a day....i did almost nothing productive.  Sometimes that
can be very tire----ing. Vey it can.  Blah.  Here I sit stoned (agaiin).
And is this productive?  Sure tis.  Cause I'm typing, therfore I'm using my
brain!  Kinda.  I use words to say stuff or things or tories or nothing.  I am
still usuing words, now I am just typing as fast as I can and saying as little
as possible trying not to confuse either of us.....and these lines mean I'm
think...or pauseing......or doing more of my favortie
drugs................<wooow>......*RAD*....Hotel California is playing on the
tape deck!  Cool! Killer! Neato!  Bazzzzana's!  What fun it must be to be
rich......you NEVER run out of your favorite drugs!  Buzzzzz.  There she stood
in the doorway...  way   voices......say.......Welcome to the Hotel Arkansas!

Such a lovely plaalalalce...

and hit the dusty wooden floor....and soak Innnnnnnnnnnnnn....

Here I sit on this cliff.  I sit in the dust, the soothing thin sandy dirt.
And I look out onto the emptyness of the land.  I see a massive building in
the distance, toppled over with vegitation growing all over it.  As if the
earth itself was using everything it had to pull it down under the surface to
hide it from the sight of whoever may be looking at it.  In it's slow
proccess, it's pulling and working, ashamed of what we have done to It, and
what we have done to ourselves, ashamed at what we have accomplished in our
miserable existence.  And It knows I'm watching.  And it curses me.  Curses me
with it's old gaze.  Looking at me as if I was a child compared to it' aged
lifetime.  I am.  If only It could talk.  I am so glad It can't.

I extend my leg and my foot slides through the soft dirt.  And I lay back and
and close my eyes.  I feel the suns rays beat against my face, and it makes me
relaxed.  No sound.  It's frightning to hear nothing.  No birds chirping, no
cricktes sounding off, no dogs barking.  I would even settle for the sound of
a car horn blaring.  Anything but silence.  All that is left is the brussle of
leaves in the wind, the sound of a creek, the sound of rain hitting the earth.
All the sounds that were here in the beginning...........do the sounds realize
that it's here again?  The beginning, I mean?  Yes.  I'm sure they do.  And
they know that all of that time in between was a waste.  But after all, it's
not that long to them.  I wonder if they had hope for us?  Or if they knew all
along.  No matter.  It's over now.....and beginning again.  A shame.



I would like to find one thing, if I must stay here and be ridiculed by the
silence.  A woman.  I would kill for the companionship that only a woman can
provide.  Yeah....I know.....but Kill I would.  And the circle begins anew.


"Hi.  What's your name?"

"Eve...ad yours?"


Hahahahaha, I think I would drop dead from the thinking the word IRONIC right
there.  But....I'd even settle for that.  I hope I see her again.
                                                                           ...

Dribble.  Dribble.  Dripple.  Dripple.  Just ask Alice.  Or Isabeau.  Or
Druuna.  Sparkle off you sane Emerald.  Watch out for the Shadows.  You never
know who's lurking in them.  Shadows hold more than you think. There's moe
than just black there.   Shadows are secret portals to anything..anywhere.
Only...people donm't know this. Obviously.  Or we wouldn't need busses.  Or
cars, or planes, or Bay Area Rabid Transit.

Speaking of which...do you think that GOD spelled backwards is DOG by
coinsidence?  Well, I'm sure your wrong if you do.  I think there is more to
it.  But since we are all basically stupid we can't figure it out.  Yes.  You
are stupid.  You may think your aren't.  Or you may be smart...for a Human
Being.  But after all....we are pretty lame.  I mean, we look at an animal
and feel intelligent.  But isn't that pretty dumb?  Yes.


DOG!  There's a hidden meaning.  Be good to your DOG.  Or you may pay later.
Think.  Imagine some people tying you down to a table and putting you to
sleep.  And then waking up later in a white padded room, to find that they
surgicaly removed your penis.  WOuld you be a happy camper?  I think not.
I mean, sit down and think about it....if you had no penis, you would be
horribly upset.  I would.  I think I would do this a lot.....          .

How often do you sit in your room at night on speed and just Sit there
 listening to music and watching the clock tic away?  Often?  Hmmmm.  Feel
the persperation under your arms and feel your brain standing on edge.  And
feel great...yet mellow...and just sit and think...and maybe type.  Things.
And you don't find it amazing that you can sit in front of this screen and
be perfectly happy making designs with ascii characters.  Useless, meaningless
designs.  Never hungry....never thirsty....just sitting...and sitting.
Waiting for the time when you come down and wish you had more.  SSSSSHHHHHH!
Don't talk about that NOW!     Sitting and knwoing that tomorrow you have
to be up at 8.  But you can't sleep...but thats ok...at the moment. Tomorrow
is a different story, isn't it?  Yes...I think so.  No matter.  It's 2:30am
here...now.............hmmm...can I sleep at 3?  We'll see.  Rhyme!  Yep.
Metallica is playing on the radio.  And all is dark.  No light.  Hmmmmm.
And, do you ever just sit there and wonder what the HELL you are doing?
And then have the curiosity pass almost as fast?  Yes?  No?  Whats the
Answer?  What was the Question?  Who makes up the Questions?  Or more
importantly...who makes up the Answers?  And Why?  And How?  And what's
the difference?  And who cares?  And why don't they care?  And if they're
not caring about that, then prey-tell...what ARE they caring about?  Do
YOU care?  About what?  And Why?  And the viscious circle begins anew.
Thats a deadly word, "Why?"  Because everybody fears it, deep down.  We
know we can't answer every question brought to us, and we fear the dreary
day that a little girl comes up to us and asks a question like, "Why do
we have finger nails?"  And you haven't the foggiest idea...so you make up
an answer as to not look stupid.

Big trouble....big trouble.  My attention span is like an ice cube in a
blender....chipping away into little peices.  And then I loose it and
think of Something Else.  Uh oh...there's a subject that can go on forever.
I better not think of Her....or we'll be here for awhile.  <not thinking>
<nul thought>  I did it.  Good.

I have the sniffles....gee....do you think I may have a cold?  heh.  <grin>
