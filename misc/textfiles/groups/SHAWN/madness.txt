Madness is not a bad thing.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  If you're
mad...can you not think up your own images?  Think up your own world and live
there forever and ever?  Slowly deteriorating until all that is left, is a
shell of a human?  Is there something wrong with that?

I'd say that you would have to go insane on your own free will.  When all is
good in your life...then just decide to go...and sink into the warm embrace
of Madness.  And start creating your world.  If you decided to go when things
in your life were not going so well, then that would be an escape and you
would always blame that for your misadventures in your new world.

So into your world you go....down the dark black well that you know so well
because after all....you made it.  Down, down, down, down...you always did
like high altitudes, didn't you?  Plummet further....wow....no cold...no
pain...no fear...no worries...no problems.  All is what you want.

Wait..lets peak out of this window for a second:  Oh no...they're taking me
to a hospital!  Heh.  Thats funny.  No matter.  Close that window!  I feel
a draft!  Damn....brick that fucker up!  Just sit back and watch the little
blue men brick that horrid window up.  Ahh...no more drafts for quite some
time, I'd say.  It sure is nice and warm down here.  I like this place.
What would be even better?  Hmmm...how bout a nice big Ball Room?  Yes.
Filled with beautiful maidens dancing to music that sends tingles down your
spine.  Ahhh....that's much better.  And food..yes...enough food to feed
hundreds of people!  A feast we'll have!  In MY Ball Room!

What is it waiter?  You say someone is waiting for me in the Library?  (I
don't remember making a Library...hmm)  Yes...lets go...I'll see him.  Hmm..I
don't recall making this room...no matter.  Inside we go.  What's this?
Their putting me in a jacket and giving me a shot.  Wait you idiots!  You have
no right to do this!!!  NO!  Where are they taking me?  I'm glad I left this
place.  A room.  A padded room.  Fools!  Don't leave me in HERE!!  AARG!
Damn!  That makes me mad!  To HELL with them!  Leave this place I will..and
NOW.  Waiter....have that room destroyed IMEDIATLY!  And who built that room?
  You sit and watch the little blue men come again...this time with axes and
large hammers and they pound away at the Library walls.  Oh...and little
men, could you please build a Study there...it'd be a shame to let that area
go to waste......................



Hehe
    h
     e
      hehehe......ahh...sit back and relax in your Garden.  Quite a massive
Garden, I say.  Beautiful Flowers and large green trees all around. And a
little sparkling brook running through the middle.  With fish, no doubt!
Sometimes I don't have to even think and things appear and surprise me.
What a place.  I wonder why more people don't come here?  And people...I
do miss some of those people...I must admit.  But they don't understand.
It's ok...I can make my own people.  AH!  I'll make a Nymph........LOOK
THERE!  There she is!  Running through the trees in a ragged cloth skirt and
top.  Her long brunette hair flowing.  Running.  Heh.  I should chase her.
Wait...she sees me!  Her EYES...they're emerald...Sooooooo beautiful.  Come
here sweet creature...........................please?  She hides behind a
tree.  She's weary.  Hehah....I want to run with you....please?

OH NO!  What's this?!  An Earthquake?!??  Here?  In MY WORLD!  I don't WANT
an earthquake!  Oh know...all the trees are falling down!  Why is this
happening?!  I better run over to the brook...it's clear there..no trees to
fall on me.  Rubbling more than ever now...it's going to destroy my whole
Garden!  Damn these things!  I want CONTROL back!  The brook...the water
is not splashing around...it's so clear.  Wait...it's like a mirror...and...
oh no...not again........What the HELL are these fools doing to Me???????
Electric Shock Treatment?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhahahahaha!  LEAVE ME
ALOOOOONE!!!!  Arg!!  NO!  Stop it!  My world is crumbling! Damn them!  Damn
them straight to the depths of Hell itself!!  NO!  Throw a rock in this
stream and end that picture!  Think. THink. Think. THink. Concentrate.  Deep.
Deeper.  Forget about them.  No. No.  They are nothing.  Gone. Bye......



Hello, who are you?

Icka flem shroud iz.

Huh?

Whack icka fling shing!

Speak clearly you idiot...i can't understand a word you're saying!

Babi pie and shiet.  Flick and flook shick wang.

What are you?  You're just a silly rock.  Hello rock...and good-bye rock.
Rocks don't talk in My world.  So says I.  Heh.  That was funny.

Humpin frued impa wing-flack...droopan fliggan wouf.

Shut up....

Wang boy backstroke lang frilillip!

SHUT UP!

Dripinstack?

AAARRRRRRGGGG!!!!  To hell with you too!  I'll just run from you.  You can't
do THAT now CAN you, ROCK???  HA HA HA!  <sigh>  It's getting a bit
frustrating here lately.  Maybe.......maybe....nah.  Geez...I sure miss
people.  I'm tired of these rocks and Nymphs that hide behind trees.  But
if I go back to the window or the brook, I'll just see those people hurting
me and make me mad.  <sigh>

Ahh...a field....peaceful field.  Hello field.  And how are you?  Now...
finally away from all that crazy mumbo jumbo.  Hey...this is a field of
Dandilions....a million square mile field of dandelions??  Hmmm....I think
I'll walk to the center fo it.  Yes, I think I will.  And then I'll sit down
there and I'll be far away from everything and I'll sit and just sit.  Sit and
do nothing but think about sitting.  Yes.  That is what I will do.

Ah.  A million square miles is quite a ways I see.  Well, on we go.  Hello
Blue Cow.  Good-Bye Blue Cow.  That was interesting.  It's so sunny out here.
I quite like it here. Yes.  I do.  Hmmm....what is it?  100,000 miles into
this field?  At least....I hope.  it sure does looke the same everywhere.
But THIS is what I wanted so THIS is what I will do.  Hey..lookie THERE!
It's a Lady...on a horse.  With long hair....Aqua??  Aqua hair?  How
interesting.  Wow.  That's neat.  There she goes...off into the long stretch
of Land.  Almost out of sight.  Hmm.  That was Something Else, wasn't it?
Onward we go...onward to the center of this great field.  Ahhh..  It's warm
again.  heh.  Fools.  hehehe.   Dripinstack?  Hmmm.  Walking for quite some
time now......dayz.....months?  I wonder where that Lady is?  Wait..whats
that?  Ah!  A shack!  It looks like.....like....like...huh?  Like a Mushroom!
What?  Closer..I must get closer.  Walk...trot....stride...RUN!!!  RUN!
Ah...here it is.  This has GOT to be the center!  HAS to be.  A Shack.  A
shack in the shape of a Mushroom.  A door.  A door in a Mushroom?  Hmmm.
It has a sign that reads.....


R O R  -  A L U C A R D


How strange.
    What is THAT supposed to mean?  Oh well.  Doesn't look like anyone is
around.  Hehehehe.  Open the door and IN I go.  Hmm.  Looks pretty basic.
A bed. A chair.  A table in the center of the room.  And ON that table...
is a knife and a Mushroom...half of it chopped into equal peices.  Hmmmm.
Well....thats curious.

<CRASH!>  <BOOM!>  <THUNDER!>

What is THAT??  Not again!!!!  It's a Storm!  Damn those idiotic FOOLS!
Yes...it's a storm...raining and pouring.  Dammit!!  DAMN DMAN DMANMDNSMANA!
Wears that knife???  here it is.  Huh?  in the blade....it's THEM again!  I
can see THEM again!  AGAIN????  Their...their....their...giving me a shot.
I can't move...they strapped me down.  Arg!!!!  Uh!  Huh?  Soft..
They drugged me.  How could they?  What did I do to them?  They are killing
me.  They poisoned me.  no.  yes?

This is the last bad thing that will happen in my world.  As the black clouds
cover the sky and me and my mind die.....I'll remember you world.  No
point askin.  It's too late.  Soft....warm...but a different warmth.  A
warmth that soon turn cold.....grave cold.


Well....now that death is eminent....I might as well gouge my eyeballs out.
AAAAHHHHHAHahahahahahah!  Gouge 'em!  Right out!  Hahaha!  Oh yes....there's
nothin like the feeling of warm (cold?) blood dripping down your face.
Can't See it though...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, hilarious!  Choppy, choppy!
Chop them fingers RIGHT off!  Oh ho oh....Bye bye world.  Nice ta meet ya
and nice ta see ya go!  It was mighty fine going insane and I will remember
every bit of it...for the rest of my....uh....well, I'll remember it anyway.
Choppy, choppy!


Bye, Rock.


Oh won't you go Mad...oh won't you go Mad...oh won't you go Mad with Me?


And up in the air I jump...and when I come down...I don't hit the ground.
Cuz I'm on yet another journey.  Past the field and into a (h)well.  A black
well.  Except I have a feeling this one is going to be a little deeper.
And I can't tell you This story.  that would let you in on too much.  You'll
have to find this out this one on your own.  Whoa....faster we go..into
the darkness..............................................................
..................................................................
