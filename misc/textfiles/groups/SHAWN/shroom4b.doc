your journey, and the man asks you for your coin....just cock your head
and give him a smirk and say, "Hey....you think your a smart ass?  Well
I got a question for ya..."

"Ohuh?"

"You think you got the guts, Boothman?"

"Ohuh?"

Widen your smirk and simply say, "What's Next To The Moon?"

And while he's pondering that question in total amazment, just slip by
the gate and put the pedal to the metal.  Works every time!!

wonder what the big secret is.  I mean, your like a puppet under the
Blue.  And there's nothing wrong with that, now is there?  Four strings
coming of your limbs and all you do is dance.  Dance with the
Dancer....out into the void.  Follow traces...follow the light and
blend.  wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Just
blend.  bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb  tttttttttttttttttt  qq...
