    psssst!


        hey you!  have you ever found the big button under the 3rd seat on the
left (if, say you're boarding from the west in Berkeley) in BART, the big red
impending-doom-like ominous button that says "IDIOT BUTTON" in little aqua
letters?  I have.  I pushed it once...

        Next thing I knew, the train slowed down a little bit, got up on legs
and walked off the track.  It began to walk up University avenue, kinda
swaying from side to side, and began to digest its passengers.  Not me,
though, because I had smartly brought my acid-proof ABC (all-body condom) in
case of just such an emergency.  Two more corners and it began to crawl the
wrong way down telegraph.  I politely hit the air brake and got off at
Annapurna to buy incense, but I really kinda wonder where it went after that.
Anybody seen a BART train running around s. berkeley / n. oakland that thinks
it's a Mr. Snuffle-Uppagus?

Subject :Chickenzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
DateTime:11:41 am  Mon May 14, 1990


        Y'see, all domestic chickens are born with an inherent belief
(wrongly) that they cannot fly, when in truth they can.  They only have to
realize it.

        Similarly, you can fly yourself, but since you have a slightly bigger
brain than a chicken (i guess...), you have a greater mental block against it.
 Whereas it's quite possible to scare or shake a chicken out of its disbelief,
yours is probably very strong, as is most people's.

        It just gets better too... as soon as you Realize it, you can go swim
in the ground, eat concrete, and all sorts of mean nast Hor'ble things!

        In short, I have one point to make and it is this:
        "Come to where the flavor is!  Play the Goat for a while."

p.s. ~~  I just saw a flock of migrating chickens pass by my window.  They
were within a 3-mile radius of a herd of cows and wearing little oakland
raiders helmetz.  guess who!

From    :Pressed Rat #16
To      :All
Subject :Ok, while we're confessing:...
DateTime:3:27 am  Fri May 18, 1990


   Yep!  I, too, have a confession to make.  I suffer from
obsessive/compulsive disorder.  I am obsessed with body symmetry.  If I turn
around clockwise in the shower, I must turn back counterclockwise again before
washing my hair.  If I spin around to the left while going down the stairs for
breakfast I must go the other way coming up.  I don't know what would happen
if I didn't.  I would probably disintegrate and be mailed in little pieces to
the Department of X-Key upkeeping secretaries, where they'd coo and coddle
over my variant parts and record the subtle limes of reason, then raise the
raisin of a violent spectre beside my lampshade head.  Upon this, the
remaining passion for patience would be gently removed from my shoes and the
whole cycle would begin anew.

   I am obsessed with making sure my head does not roll one way or the other
on the pillow at night.  If there was a net roll to the east or west, I would
eventually roll all the way to Afghanistan before i woke up, then awake to
find myself a stranger in a stringy land of stringent strick smitten smiley
smiters, smouldering in a semblance of a semi-sapient smithy in spite of the
tennis.

    Besides this, there's the problem of going up-down-down-up and
down-up-up-down.  Let me illustrate, it's like this:

Here's one basic cell.

-__-

And the basic cell can be combined.  here's a second-order cell...

-__-        -__-
    _--__--_

and the reverses of these are:

_--_  and     -__--__-
          _--_        _--_

Now an even bigger one would go like this:
                -__-        -__- -__-        -__-
    -__--__-        _--__--_         _--__--_        -__--__-
_--_        _--_                                 _--_        _--_ .


And this could be inverted too, with various conclusions.
See, it's all binary and I could go on farther but it would go beyond
the screen.

But it's all binary and the point is, how many of these larger and larger
meta-cycles can you hold in y0ur head bef0re you have t0 banish y0urself to
L0wer Sl0b0via where you are to live for ten years in self-imposed solitary
confinement, eating only the battered and rejected frozen-ammonia bars that
never made it on the international stoics' market for unrequested treats?

How long?   Just how long would YOU last?  I'm really not sure how long I'd
last.  It would be interesting to try.  SO many things would be s0 interesting
to just try yi yi yi...  try sampling a smattering of smee!

Or say "smee" (or whatever the word happens to be in your world) from Beyond
Zork and see where it gets you.  Also, ever tried wielding the phase blade and
using it to destroy the vague outline?  Now THERE's a good trick!


Adios guacamoles!  I continue unabated in my research and will let you know
how it goes.  For now, it appears that the whether report will include many
Evil Twin Bunny skirmishes in the vicinity of El Cerrito... Maybe they'll
visit U, 2.

                                                                       pr
