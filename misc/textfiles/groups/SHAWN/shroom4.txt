    SCENE - 1

[ A dark Friday night, clouds covering the moon.  Temperature around
   Warm....]

  Outside of Carbon Based Unit #1's house a white Mustang with blue
strips pulls up to the curb and parks.  The engine goes off and then the
sounds of AC/DC come to a hault.  The car door shuts and Carbon based
Unit #2 walks up to the house.  Into the door and up to CBU#1's room.

CBU#1: "Arooobaaahhh!"

CBU#2: "Whats up dude!  Ready to jam?  {drink beer}

 (note: the { } sign indicate subliminal messages from the current
        carbon based unit.  Also, they have been called Fnords...]

CBU#1: "Shoobetcha...let me get my jacket and we're off!  Boy...I sure
        could go for a beer...."

CBU2:  "Okeedokey, fine..."


  CBU 1 & 2 exit the house and walk over to the piss yellow Omni, CBU1
mumbles something about 400 pounds of shit in the back of his car to CBU2 and
they start walking to the Mustang, get in and proceed onward with their
journey of unknown destination.

  After a quick stop at the liquor store they arrive at Carbon Based Unit #4's
house.
<knock knock>  <creeeeeaaaaaaakk>

CBU1: "It's Death at your door, you knob!"


CBU2: "Geez, eh....I sure could go for a beer, let us in, you knob!"

CBU4: "Aaaaaahhhh, there's too inlarged hosers at the door!  Hey,
       dudes...come on in!"



  The beers are cracked open and the Units have a seat.  CBU#1 & CBU#2
leech some of CBU#4's wisdom and all around awesome knowledge as they
continue to drink.  CBU#4 passes around a joint to other CBU's and they
all attempt to get stoned.  (But other things happen....)  They watch a
MOST twisted tale of the Twilight Zone and ponder this extremely Deep
Question with laughs...

       "If you were in an Airlock and about to be jettisoned ....would you
        hold your breath?"


  None of them has a direct answer to this....but feel enlightened after
thinking about it.

CBU#4:  "Hahahahahahaha..."

CBU#2:  "HahahaHAhaHA.."

CBU#5:  "HahaHHAHAhahah..."

CBU#1:  "Hohohohohoh..."


   After an hour or two CBU#1 & 2 get up and with farewells they leave.
They head back over to CBU#1's house, and on the way see CBU#3's car!
They slow down and wait...as it turns around a follows them back to
their destination.

CBU#3:  "Where the FUCK have you guys been?!  I've been looking all over
         for you!!"

CBU#1:  "Oh...we went over to CBU#4's for a few Beers...whatcha doing,
         eh?"

CBU#2:  "Wanna do some Mushrooms??"

CBU#3:  "I sat out in front of your house for 2 hours.  Hahaha.  Shit.
         So...did you talk to Paul about the pool table? "

CBU#1:  "Yep...all I have to do is go GET it!"

CBU#2:  "Wanna do some Mushrooms??"

CBU#3:  "He better not gonna change his mind and give it to someone
         else!  That table is going to Doc's..and thats THAT!"

CBU#1:  "Yeah, I know...it's MY table, all we havta do is pick it up!"

CBU#2:  "Wanna do some Mushrooms??"

CBU#3:  "Great.  So...lets go to Cliff's or something, I'm not going
         home after waiting all that time...."

CBU#1:  "Hmmm...wanna go to Doc's and do some Mushrooms??"

CBU#3:  "Hmmm, ok, sure!"

CBU#2:  "Mushrooms?"


   As CBU#1 & 3 proceed to take a leak on a tree in the front yard,
CBU#2 waves and takes off, followed by CBU#1 & 3 in the piss yellow
Omni.

   Soon they all arive to CBU#2's home of residence.  They quietly enter
the house and slip down into the basement as to not arouse any sleeping
CBU's.


SCENE - 2

 [ A dark Basement.  Time: 11pm.  With Condeferate Flag and miscellaneous
   road signs the wall.  Floor cluttered with engine parts and junk.
   Big stereo, miscellaneous chemicals about and the Green Glacier ominously
   glowing on a shelf.  A bottle of Everclear, a skull, the black fone and
   some used foil cradles....  A PERFECT place to fry your brain!]


CBU#3: "So, all we have to do is move all this shit and out the
        table right here!"

  CBU#2 runs upstairs to grab some bread and peanut putter, some Liptons
ice-tea in the cans and a butter knife.  (Big, Long, Sharp, Pointy,
KNIFE??!)

CBU#1:  "Yep!  Get it level, put the bar right there and we're in
         business!!"

  CBU#2 returns....gets the keys out of his pocket and opens the secret
drug cabinet.  Pulls out a box filled with miscellaneous drug
paraphenalia and grabs a bag of shrooms from it.  They all make up a quick
sandwhich.

CBU#3:  "Gobble, gobble, gobble, <glurp>.."

CBU#2:  "Scarf, Scarf...Scarf....<Gulp>...."

CBU#1:  "Gulp, Gulp, GulP....<Swallow>........"


   CBU#1 peeks out the window to the backyard and says high to
Cremator...who is steadily peering into the window awaiting the CBU's at
ANY givin moment to take him to Wildcat Canyon for a walk, even though
it is pitch black out.  At the window he sits.

   While CBU#1 & 3 are talking about nuclear fission, CBU#2 secretly
slinks over to a table, opens a toolbox and grabs a syringe.  He
SPRINGS out at CBU#3 and chases him around the room!  CBU#1 points out
that any minute CBU#3 is going to be peeking and that a syringe might
not be the best thing for him to be staring at since he has a phobia
towards them.  CBU#3 agrees totally as a drop of sweat drops off his
head onto the basement floor.  CBU#2 puts the syringe away and they all
sit.

CBU#3: "My fingers are starting to tingle...."

CBU#1: "I wonder what Gary is up to......Hahaha, just kidding."

CBU#2 is playing Nethack.


40 minutes later.....


CBU#3:  "Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh, maaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnn....."

CBU#1:  "Baaaaaaaaaaaaaddd Shrooooooooooooooooooooooooooom................
           Gooooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddd Shrrrrrrrrroooooommmm...."

CBU#2:  "Wwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhooooooaaaaa, maan.  Oh...woooowww!"


  The CB Units are peeking about this time.  Trying to hold a meaningful
conversation to keep them from slipping into the Ozone of Farble...

CBU#1:  "I have 400 pounds of useless SHIT in the back of my car...you
         want to go unload it know?   <grin>"

CBU#3:  "Maybe I should go to the bathroom?   <faaadee>"

CBU#2:  "He just sits there.....he just sits at the window, and waits.
         Most dogs are asleep by now...but he just waits there..."

CBU#1:  "He doesn't want to go anywhere because he think that if he
         leaves for a split second, that we will go to Wildcat for a
         walk without him.  SttttttUUUUUUUUpppid, Doggggggggg.....Haha."

CBU#3:  "HahahahahahaahahahaaaahahahahaahahahahahHAHAHahAHAhAhahAha!!"

CBU#1:  "phphplhphlhplhphphphlhplhphlphlhphphlhplhhplhph...."

CBU#2:  <ffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy>


15 minutes pass with no sound....shapes shift and sounds float by...Pink
Floyd plays through the speakers lullying the CB Units into the neather
reaches of the Land Of Else....pulling them through time layers and
eddies of light....to the soft, smooth, Aqua coloured Land Of Else.

CBU#1 is stunned by the sharp sound of bells coming directly at him
through those big boxes.....he waves a hand in front of his face and
Shifts back into reality.

CBU#1:  "Ahhh...weeding out the bad brain cells...getting rid of the
         sick and old.  I think I'll get up....."
         <He thinks about getting up...>

CBU#3 is meanwhile playing with his fingers...he touches his two index
fingers together...

CBU#3:  "What happends if you leave your fingers together like this for
         too long, I wonder....."

CBU#1:  "They MATE of course..."

CBU#3 & 1 look at each other and find that realization funnier than all
hell itself and commence laughing.  CBU#2 is watching the pretty colours
move in his Telix dialing directory.

CBU#3:  "Hahahaha....I better not do this too long or I'll have 14
         fingers!  HAHAHAHAHA!

CBU#1:  " HAhahahaha!  You'll wake up with 14 fingers and say DAMN!
            don't you HATE when that happens??!?  HAHAHAHAH!

CBU#3:  "OH, GOD....14 fingers and <looking at his feet> 20 toes!!  What
         do you do with 20 toes??!!"

CBU#1:  " 14 fingers and 20 toes.......and SIX HEADS!!! HAHAHAHHAHA!"

CBU#2 puts on a pair of welding goggles and is amazed at the new world
he has found....he is totally awed by this new place...these new fuzzy
shaped and dim light.  He thinks he'll stay.

CBU#3:  "SIX HEAD!  HHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA     "

CBU#1:  "What would I claim on my tax form?"

CBU#3 zones out...

CBU#1:  "Six heads...it's literally impossible to get anything done with
         6 heads.  You would argue about everything!  Then theres always
         that ~bad~ head.....the one that always goes ~Lalalalalala~ when
         all the others are trying to sleep.

         Head-1, "Shut Up!  You always do that!!!"
         Head-4, "Lalalalalalalaalalalalalalalalalalaallaalalalalalala!"
         Head-2, "Hit him!  Hit the fucker!  Shut up!  I have a date
                  tomorrow!!"
         Head-5, "Me too, Dammit!!
         Head-4, "Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala!"
         Head-3, "Take this!"

          <Head-3 tries to punch Head-4!!  Head-4 dodges the blow from
           Head-3.  Head-2 swings at Head-4...misses and hits Head-5!>

         Head-5, "OUCH!"
         Head-4, "Hhahahahaa, you misses! Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala!>
         Head-1, "Get him again!  Swing at him!  Shut that Son-of-a-bitch
                  up!!"

          <Head-5 swings at Head-4, misses and knock Head-1 unconscious!
           Head-4 is wide-eyed and has a serious grin on his face...
           Head-2 throws a vase at Head-4, Head-4 ducks and it breaks
           a mirror.  Head-5 throws a fist at Head-4 but hits Head-3
           instead!  Head-4 bites Head-5's ear and starts pulling!>

         Head-5, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!"
         Head-3, "Grab him now while he's not moving!!!!"

          <Head-3 grabs Head-4 and holds him still while Head-2 gets
           some duck tape.  Heads-1-2-3-5 duck tape Head-4's mouth shut.
           Head-4 screams and yells still but is muffled now...>

         Head-5, "Geezus!  It's about time!  Now lets get some sleep!"
 Muffled Head-4, "Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala
                  lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala!"


Time passes..................s-l-o-w-l-y.................

   SCENE - 3

 [ Carbon Units 1, 2, & 3 are in CBU#2's basement.  All in their
   respective corners, zoning, spacing, shifting, and frying.  The
   Time: 2:30am.]

   CBU#1 in his chair of solitary, CBU#3 laying on the floor watching
   the wood move on the wall, and....]

  CBU#2 is staring out into the backyard at through a slit in the
blinds, dawning his welding goggles.  The Pit Bull Unit is still
in the same location under the window....occasionally he jumps up on the
window seal to get a closer look at CBU#2.

CBU#2:  "......and the funny part is, that I am in totally control of
         his life.  <shift out>"

CBU#3:  "I think I'll go to the bathroom. What time is it? "

CBU#3 gets up  from his corner and goes to the bathroom.

CBU#1:  "Oh, man...I have a date tomorrow at 8 in the morning.  Oh, man.
         What was I thinking??  Lets take Mushrooms at 11 at night?
         SsssssttttUUUUUUUUUpppiiiiddddd, SSSSSSSTTttuUUUUUUpppiidd!!"

CBU#1 stands up and moves 5 feet NorthEast and stops.

CBU#2 turns around and lifts his goggles off.

CBU#2:  "whoa.....reality....no way..........."

CBU#2 slides his goggles back onto his head and stares out through the
blind again.

CBU#1:  "Colours, man..........................traces, traces.  Oh,
         shit....I gotta come down.  I have to go to sleep!  Ohhhhh,
         fuck.  <CBU#1 turns and looks at CBU#2>  Things are Shiften,
         man...things are Shiften............."

CBU#2:  "#(*#@!)$*@....#@(& $&^%^%%^)!$%#$&*%.....<bink!>.............
              <bbbuuuuuuuuuuuuuuzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....>


300 seconds later.......

CBU#3 returns from the bathroom.  CBU#1 goes to the bathroom.

CBU#3:  " Wow.  Neat bathroom.  I was stuck in there for awhile....
         What time is it?"

CBU#2 moves away from the blind and removes his goggles.  Takes a deep
breath and slumps over and stairs at the floor.

CBU#3 returns to his spot on the floor.

CBU#1 returns from the bathroom.

CBU#1:  "Ya know, Doc...if you just take all that shit off the wall in
         there and take that toilet out, that would be a really neat
         place.....nice and white....and square..and small...."


The CB Units are still and quiet...the only sound is that of the crisp
sounds of an egg frying in a skillet.

CBU#2:  "It looks like a normal floor...................................
         ..........................................................."

CBU#1:  "It talks like a normal floor..............................."




   SCENE - 5

 [ The need for Surface arrives.  The need for Reality is here.  The
   absence of anything Real has gone on long enough.  Exhaustion set
   in.  The mind has over worked in these CBU's.  The need for rest and
   Surface has come.  Time:  3:46 ]


CBU#3:  "Man...you ready to go, Guy?  "

CBU#1:  " I dunno, man....are you?  I know I can't drive, dude.  "

CBU#3:  "You sure?  man....I jus want to go home and sleep...."

CBU#1:  "Me too....oh....warm surface.....sleep...."

CBU#2:  "man...what were we thinking?  Ohhhhhhhhhhh......Baaaaaaaaddd
         Shroooooooooooooooooommmmmm...."

CBU#1:  "baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddd sshhrrrrrrrrrrrrroooooommmm..."

CBU#3:  "You sure you can;t drive?"

CBU#1:  "Oh, man...I mean....a piss yellow Omni zipping through Richmond
         with 400 pounds of shit in the back and 2 people driving on
         hallucinagens.  I think that would arouse suspicion.
          Oooohhhhh.  I'll work the steering wheel if you
         work the peddles?  hahaha.  Ok, but your driving..."

CBU#3:  "Nope.  I ain't driving.  Man.....i gotta change a water pump
         tomorrow.  Oh, FUCK!

CBU#2:  "Shit....I can't wait till tomorrow.  Stone cold Reality is what
         I need.........."

CBU#3:  "I hope when I wake up tomorrow I'm normal.....you can't drive?"

CBU#1:  "Man....I'm still stuck on 6 heads...Hahahahahahaha."

A few more minutes pass......the CB Units are still stuck in Else but
realize that they aren't peeking anymore...

CBU#1:  "Welp....you wanna make a break for it?"

CBU#3:  "Yeah....ok...lets try..."


The CB Units quietly walk up the stairs and into the kitchen.  CBU#1
grabs a cinnamon roll.  The CB Units 1 & 3 leave into the realm of the
Road.  CBU#2 returns to the basement and turns off all the electrical
appliances.  Then goes to bed.  Sleep comes around 5:30am...........





                     +++--- CONCLUSION ---+++

  When in need a an Anchor to Reality....a Pit Bull is always there for
ya!

The Search for Surface was a long Search.  But a prosperous one indeed.
All is wierd....all is unreal.  These are the times that you need to
venture out into that big world (whichever it may be) and find your own
Anchor to Reality.

        Stay tuned for further adventured in the Land Of Else!
 Next file will be a trip to Else via the Acid Express.
 Until then...........
