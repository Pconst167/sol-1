              First off I'm sure some of you have done this before...if
 you are TRUE visitors of Else. Basically, this is a simple Filter Flask
 bong.  [BASICALLY??  Shit...I put a LOT of work into this!!!  ;)]
 If not....that's ok.  There's still hope for you, yet.

  Special thanks to: Pressed Rat, RatSnatcher, & Sir Death for
                     mind melds.  And Space Ace for the BEST Christmas gift
                     you could get from someone you've never met.  Shroom On!






                                   Ingredients
                                   -----------

1]  A 2 Liter Filter Flask (note:  A Filter Flask is different from a regular
                                  Flask.  If you buy this, specify FILTER
                                  Flask.  The easiest  way to get this flask
                                  is by calling up your local Chemical
                                  warehouse.  But brand new these fuckers
                                  cost about $66.00!  But hey....small price
                                  to pay for a Green Glacier, right?
                                  If you live in the Bay Area, this is where
                                  I got mine:

                                        BRYANT LABORATORY INC.
                                        1101 Fifth Street
                                        Berkeley, Ca  94710
                                        Phone (415) 526-3141



2]  About 2 feet of 1/2 clear hose (You can easily find this at your local
                                   hardware store.)

3]  A cork that fits the top of the Flask  (Go get the flask first and THEN
                                            go to the hardware store. )

4]  A Bowl and Piping  (Now go to your nearest Head Shop and pick up a Bowl
                        and some bong piping.  About 10" of piping. Sometimes
                        they only sell the piping in about 4" sizes at the
                        largest. Such was the case with me....so I super
                        glued two together.  Or, you can find a better Head
                        Shop or make due with what ya got....  RoR, man...
    

5]  Some Green Food Coloring

6]  Some water, ice, and the killer weed!





                                 Construction
                                 -----------


      Now...take the cork plug and drill a hole through the center, wide
enough so that the piping fits through it, tightly. Now place the Bowl on the
piping and then stick the other end of the piping through the hole in the
cork.  Make it a fairly tight fit.

Connect the hose.


      Drop about 6 or 7 cubes of ice into the flask and fill it with water to
about 1800ml.  My flask only marks measurements up to 1600, such may be the
case with yours, so here again...make due.  Now put about 4 or 5 drops of
the green coloring fluid into the water in the flask.  This gives it that eery
Green Glacier Look!!  And when your stoned you should read the letters:


                           "ROR - ALUCARD"


floating amoungst the green liquid.  As you are reading these letters you will
have a momentary flash of Ultimate Wisdom in your mind.  This is not 
coincidental!  But unfortunatly, we are still a very primitive race and can not
yet have or even see Ultimate Wisdom.  That's MY theory anyway.  Nevertheless..
you WILL see Ultimate Wisdom....go for it....do it man....check it out!
And if you see Alice on your journeys....tell Her I said Hi, would ya?




      Put the piping and cork plug through the top of the flask and press down
until the cork seals the flask off.  Airtight, eh?


Now, Burn, baby, BURN!




                                    Theory
                                    ------


       Now, in case you can't figure out the purpose of this little device...
don't fear because I am here to explain.  Now...you put some of the killer
weed in the bowl (did I forget to mention to get screens?  No...I assumed your
not THAT lame...), and light up.  Inhale from the end of the hose and the
smoke will go down through the piping and into the water in bubbles.
(Important Part here) It will then travel up to the surface in Ice Cold water
therefor cooling the smoke and when it gets to the surface it's fairly cool.
Then it goes through the filter on the side of the flask and enters your
system, and then soaks into your brain cells and registers a One-Way Ticket to
The Land of Else!  Which no mortal man can deny!  Anyway, the main purpose of
this baby is to get the smoke cooler so that it goes down easy and takes the
rasp out of it.  So you can hold the smoke in longer and send your brain a
nice surprise.  Also, another important thing about the Ice Water Bong is that
if you simply cap the end of the hose after inhaling (You don't even really
need to cap it...just for best results) any smoke still in the flask will be
locked in there between the water and the end of the hose.  So it's saved for
a bit later!  Bitchen, huh?  Oh, and the Green Food Coloring does things that
I am not at liberty to give out.  Top Secret.  Sorry....



      Notes from Sir Death:   It's best to use a wooden bowl, because metal
                              bowl tend to burn hotter and scorch the precious
                              buds.  And a wooden bowl just burns with it.
                              Sortuv like Harmony, eh?
