    Little Jane
-------------------

Seems to me, Jane,
Little Jane.

Your beauty awes me,
I lust for you, Jane.
Little Jane.

Long, soft, blonde hair,
Lips of pearl,
Blue eyes, Eyes that never see.
Eyes of a cat.

Oh beautiful Jane,
Little Jane.

You leave without a word,
Your eyes don't see.

You've taken my heart,
And broke it, so cruel.
I lust after you, Jane.

Eyes not of a puss,
But of a Puma.
That turned and broke my heart.

Seems to me, Jane.
Little Jane.

I crawl in the sun,
Oh it's so hot.
I crawl on the beach,
For shade there is not.

I have a bag of heroin,
Oh, how I treasure.
For this bag is my friend,
I will lose it never.

I have no food,
Nor any water.
It's summer,
Now it's much hotter.

Three days, no food to be eaten,
I have a knife and some thread,
If I I lose to much blood,
I will then be dead.

I now have one leg,
Oh, where are the ships?
I'm hungry again,
All thats left are my hips.

I can only take one arm,
For I need one to eat.
After this arm,
There will be no more meat.

Sand is hot,
It's so hard to move.
I'm a bloody stump,
I need some more food.

I have nothing now,
But my heroin is here.
Sniff. Sniff.
Now, life is more clear.

Here I lie,
In the sand, I cry.
I'm stoned,
I'm high.

Now I shall die.

In my Tower,
I see the mass.
They seem so happy,
They picnic in the grass.

I sight one now,
His face, it smiles.
I fire my shot,
It can be heard for miles.

There here the sound,
They all become quiet.
They look in wonder,
Then starts a riot.

They scream,
They run.
I fire my gun.

Another dies,
They drop like flies.

Pain and sorrow,
I have no pity.
I'm in my Tower,
I overlook the city.

Bam Bam,
Two more die quick.
I load my gun,
It's my death stick.

It's now time to go,
I've done my dead.
Forgive me not,
I'm the evil stead.

They'll try for revenge,
I'll give them none.
I'm in my Tower,
I have my gun.

Gun to my head,
Fire.....I'm dead.

Little Bug,
You can't hide from me.
You try and run,
I follow thee.

I watch you close,
Amuzing you are.
Fear in your soul,
You can't run that far.

Little Bug,
You are my friend.
You work so hard,
So that will end.

Run run run,
You move so fast.
Around a rock,
Through the grass.

Little Bug,
Little friend.
When I get bored,
Your job will end.

Little Bug,
Too bad you can't fly.
<SMASH>,
Goodbye.

                            Of fools' New Appetites

                  Suppose that we could see the world unraped,
                     by man, without a defect. Only lakes,
                     ravines and beauty all around. Uncaped
                 of filth and smog; serene and peaceful; aches
                  and worries gone; just nature running free.
                        I weep because it will never be.

No the beautiful is making sexual comments...

Oh well, here goes another poem...

(more satan)

 The Storm

Capricious Skys darken the south
as the last saint is laid into the sepulcher.
Men watch as the heaven's foreboding
leaves them in utter mystery.
The canopy of black rises into unrelenting rage,
appeasing the evil, beating down the good,
and leading the undecided evermore to the south.
Few men stand against the Tumult,
preferring to supplicate to he who is truly dark,
the storm incarnate. Those who stand are soon put
into threshers to become food for the
low. The saint weeps, but her tears simply
become part of an unheard oration.

                          "When Pit Bulls Play"


You see? You see?
They're running after me.
I can't stop now,
I have to live somehow.

They run so fast,
I'd better haul ass.
Big heads, big jaws,
Sharp teeth, strong paws.

If I slow down,
And they get within range,
I'll soon be dead,
Isn't that strange?

If they lock on,
Kiss my ass goodbye.
They'll shred me alive,
And soon after, I'll die.

They run and run,
They never give up.
Single track mind,
A fence? I'm stuck!

I can go no further,
I turn and see...
These demons from Hell,
About to eat me.

They jump, they land,
What came off?  My hand.
My leg, it jerks,
Blood it spurts.

One grabs my chest,
It crushes at best.
My arm, one holds,
<crack>, it folds.

I play dead,
Oh god help me.
Make them leave,
Hear my plea.

Muzzles covered with blood,
I lie still, in the mud.
They leave me to die,
God....why?

Here I stay,
One arm, one leg.
Crippled, maimed.
For life I now beg.

They run free, run wild.
They attack all, even a child.
Pity on those, that stand in their way,
When Pit Bulls play, they take life away.

Oh Laurie, Oh Laurie,
You look so cool.
I see your tight thighs,
It makes me drool.

        If I give you a Beer,
        Will you be a sweat Dear?
        Will you wear white lace,
        And sit on my face?

Your legs are smooth,
They're perfect for me.
What do you want?
So I can fuck thee.

        Your body, your face.
        I want to embrace.
        You're chest, your breast,
        I think I like best.

Your tits are so fine,
They're pert and large.
Can I sink my face,
And play "Deep sea Barge"?

        Oh how I'd like,
        To fuck you doggie style,
                                           Will you bend over,
                                           And bark for awhile?


Tit fuck you,
I'd like to do.
Anal bang? I think I'll pass,
But Ed and Guy would love your ass.

        I'll eat your cunt,
        I'll make you hum.
        You suck my dick,
        Until I cum.


Spread those legs wide,
Your cunt I shall plow.
If only Stanley E. Yale,
Could see you now.

        Sploodge you'll slurp,
        You'll get every bit.
        All over your chest,
        All over your tit.

Oh Laurie, oh Laurie,
You're so cute on your knees.
I cum on your face,
Uuunnggh, get out please....

                       The THORAZINE SHUFFLE
                        -By Doctor Murdock
                -Extra chemical testing by Sir Death


Ya know them nights that you get so high?
So high, on a hill over-lookin the town.
So high, so high, ya just can't come down.

Doin Speed all night,
Can't count the lines of Cocaine.
Your head hits the pillow,
You're feelin NO pain.....

Gotta get up early, gotta job to do.
So ya reach over to the table, under some magazines.
Ya see your littles helpers, some 25milligram THORAZINES!

Thorazine, Thorazine,
Oh how you make me feel fine.
25 milligrams, 2 or 3.
Relaxin every muscle of mine.

Can't stare at the ceiling, ya gotta get some sleep.
Thorazine will put you out, teeth you won't be chewin.
But The next day, The THORAZINE Shuffle is what you'll be doin'.

Where do ya get some?
I'll tell ya for a couple hits.
Ya gotta bribe dentists and doctors,
Out of their perscription slips.

Shuffle a little to the Left,
A little to the Right.
Rockin and a rockin,
You'll be doin' it all night.

Twichin on Meth?  Tweakin on Coke? Got the need for Speed?
Ya can do all these...and feel just grand.
And it's all ok, if ya got some Thorazine at hand.

People think your dancin,
To music only you can hear.
When they ask, "Whatcha doin'?"
Just say, "The Thorazine Shuffle, ma Dear!"

Small price to pay,
For a small friend indeed.
When your just to high to sleep,
50 miligrams of Thorazine is all ya need!

 =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=



              Here we live on a planet of Doom;
              Corruption and pain surrounds us all;
              Death, day by day.  All lose around us;
              All lose at the game of life.  His life.

               So sure am I,
               I know soon, I'll die.

          I riddle, a riddle, and Alligator dribble.
          Death will rise, so the riddle you'd better memorize.

             It hides in corners and waits for the weak;
             For the strong are hard to take;
             But all will be caught, whether tough or meek;
             For It is everywhere at once, forever waiting.

               So sure am I,
               I know soon, I'll die.

          Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, chosen by one.
          Ever by fate, our lives, we wait.

             It will come when you are sick;
             It will show no mercy, for your life is one of many;
             It shows no emotion but must feed;
             It is there.  But never where?  Know the riddle true.

               So sure am I,
               I know soon, I'll die.

          Macabre is It.  The riddle is His.
          The Journey is for no mortal. Solve the riddle, find the portal.

             It is the slayer of mortal beings;
             For the collector of souls is It;
             Eternity is It's home.  Forever is It's life;
             It has a master.  It is His servant.  What?  Who?

          Keep sight of your goal. Or the Demon Nymph will swallow your soul.
          A sacrafice you must.  And your Death, you must trust.

               OH HOW I LOVE TO LOVE MY HEATHER

                         By Ed Smith
                  accompanied by Guy Prince




Now I used to get so drunk, ol'Doc couldn't tell whether I
was dead or alive.

Decided to settle down, sose I got married at the age of
twenty five.

She had a couple of teeth missing and a bowl hair cut, ooh
wee.....what a cuute little thang.

A bow legged bell of the ball, in sixth grade gotsta be at
least twelve or thirtaane


Oooh weeee, I love my sweet thang
Oh I love to love my Heather.  I love to love my Heather more
than I love my pickup, houndogs and my beer all put together.


Now nine months later, came our first boy by the name of
Billy-bob.

And just five months after, along came twins 'bout
the time that I lost my job.

We had to buckle down, scrimp and save all our nickles, dimes
and pennies.

That meant no more of them romantic dinners, down at the
local Denny's.


Ooooh weee, I love my sweet thang
Oh I love to love my Heather.  I love to love my Heather more
than I love my pickup, houndogs and my beer all put together.


The pickup would hardly run, the dogs went hungry, but ol'
Heather never shed a tear.

I pitched in and did my part, as I had to switch to generic
beer.

My gal was lookin' raggy, as all her clothes were just a
fallin' apart.


Couldn't wait till I got some extra cash, to buy her fancy
things from K-MART.


Oooh wee, I love my sweet thang
Oh I love to love my Heather.  I love to love my Heather more
than I love my pickup, houndogs and beers all put together.


Gone down thru' life, not carin' not really knoin' what love
was about, stickin' together when life got messy, like
guttin' a trout, not listnin' to Heather when she got fussy.

Ya see life's kinda funny in it's own way.


Oooh wee, I love my sweet thang
Oh I love to love my Heather.  I love to love my Heather more
than I love my pickup, houndogs and beer all put together.

The silver streaks fill the sky,
Their immense size is comaprable to none..
I watch them as they fall...
Like the tear drops of God.

Our existence is over..
We cannot prevent it now..
The stupidity of knowledge
We are the dead.

The aftermath of apocalypse..
The end of life.
A baby cries amongst the rubble.
and the cycle begins once again..

Remember what the door knob said, feed your head, feed your head!


The time of life is an immesurable factor..
We as humans are finite..
I turn to him for everlasting life.
The one force that can save me.
I love him with all my heart,
for he is eternal life.
He is SaTaN..
The purveyor of life, and the giver of death..
Pain and death have no boundaries,
and he is forever with me..
For all of time.

Too see that life must pass us by,
we know we cannot control it.
This life we fear is just a lie,
Full of vile indeciencies.

Can we never know this till we die?
Though life is hidden from us,
we are concealed, left alone
Abandoned in this consciousness,
we call a universe.

Bound together, forever.
Or maybe what is said is false,
and we all know it inside
and see the face of God.

The mind is a terrible thing
----------------------------

In my mind there are many, many, little
Rooms where people, places, things, thoughts, feelings,
And stuff sort themselves out and just sit
There and wait until I need them and
Then I search and search and search through
The many, many, many little rooms

Sometimes I get lost.

A ball of smelting fire so glowing bright
A dipping down horizon night does bring
Presumed intent for to see you to-night
Where my head may lie leaves no want or need
An understanding given some peace may-be
May I pray for sign that may lead mnforth
<May I pray for sign that may lead me forth

Hold my hand, I'd like to show you.
A place you've never seen.
Can I ask you a question?
Do you find Death serene?

      I want to bring you into my world.
      My world is one of pain.
      I've been here for so long.
      Long ago my soul was slain.

Without a soul, you feel no more.
And now I want to share.
I want to rip your life to shreds.
Go ahead....make one last prayer.

      Haha, scream all you can.
      I love the sound of fear.
      Scream and shout, and run about.
      Oh yes...and please add a tear.

So many ways to end your life.
It's so hard to choose.
No matter what a pick.
You my friend, shall lose.

      Your throat should slit like butter.
      The flesh of mortals is so thin.
      The blood will pour with a thickness.
      And your agony shall then begin.

Or skin your body alive.
And watch you die so slow.
And squirm and screech.
With every grain of salt I throw.

      Or drill a hole though every tooth.
      Then you'll surely yell.
      Your eyeballs widen to the rising torture.
      And you'd swear you're in Hell.

Maybe chops off every limb.
And leave you in a rodent infested cave.
The rats will gnaw you to a skeleton.
They'll be nothing left to put in a grave.

      Or chain you to an anvil.
      And drop you in a lake.
      Fight for air as your lungs fill with water.
      And drown at the bottom and never awake.

It doesn't matter, die you will.
But not now, maybe not for awhile.
So wait here, wait for your end.
For now I shall think, you're Death I'll compile.

    You are in a crowd outside of a grocery market. With people hustling and
bustling.  Warm temperature.  Loud voices.  And then someone catches your
eye.......he is almost undestinquishable from the rest of the people, except
for the blue and red tights, and his confederate flag cape fluttering in the
light breeze.  You notice seconds later that he has a lamp shade tied to his
shoulder.  You cannot distinguish his facial features due to the red and blue
mask.  Suddenly the crowd hushes as the stranger becomes alert and cups one
hand over his ear, as if to ear something more clearer....the crazed young lad
screams something about injustice, and about Coors being opened in a distant
place. Without a moment lost he yells "Tis SHAWN-DA-LAY BOY to the aid of all
Bud BEER drinkers and to the disposal of all Coors Lovers!!!" And you see the
virile masked avenger look into the sky with a frown of undying hatred. And
with a single twirl of his lampshade, he bends down and suddenly leaps into
the air, ripping into the heavens faster than a dragtser doing a 5 second
quarter mile, in a course only known to him. The crowd awes in amazement!!
And as they look around at each other with gaping mouths, all notice the
single Budweiser can twirling at an angle where he was standing.


    And suddenly you have a warm knowledge that all is safe.....

                                    Sir Death & Doctor Murdock

Lurking Horror..
-----------------

The sight of the unseen, the smell of the slain,
who am I to judge the living and the dead? Why am
I? To what purpose do I serve? He sees my fear, he
senses my emotion and feeds like a deprived child,
I cry in anguish and hide between the two things He cannot see,
Love, and Kindness, I hide and cry. Then, he senses me and I
cannot hide any longer, I show myself and relenquish my
soul to him. He drinks of my life blood, greedily slurping
it like a famished dog. Then, he throws the shell away,

And the hunt begins anew...

"Jiminy Crickets!"  Creme de menthe so wilt to do
And flim an ambient din farroo
Ski an errant floppy top
To drop this mountain upon the rocks
Is far more diffy than to do
To shoe this mare within her lair
And crown her with this nimble chair
This silly willy, so wiley and willing
"Is Night!"  And so to find her milly
She does a jig to none but frig
Who cheers and splits,  "Harroo!  Harroo!"
To none, my sweets, but only you.

Above me lived the woman of the third floor
I would sit upon the stairs just to see her.
Me knowing little what lie in her core
She would pass me by, nothing as a blur
Her eyes did not look, they would pass me over
In the wind flowed her hair of purple stands
In steps behind was a friend, watching her
They flew up the stairs walking hand in hand
On each other's lips the other's did land
The person she held was not of her kin
My lover held a woman still as grand.
The lady I love is a lesbian.
I fell in love with a past image held,
But I still love, this sight my heart not felled..

                      SORROW


Here I sit in this dark room with no light upon my eyes.
I sit here for I pain from an emotion.
This emotion makes me fear not. Death is but a fact now.
I sit here and wonder Why? My life seems so small.
I now realize my mortality. I am small.
I don't want to die.  But someday I will. But now...
I sit here in this dark room and wonder Why?
An emotion that makes me numb. And feel pain like no other.
My heart is dead now. I feel for no thing. I am but a shell.
Here I sit.  I have been robbed of something I Loved.
Someone....I Loved. I Love. And will always Love...but now...
This Love is my pain. My life has no purpose.
Here I sit...and wonder...Why?

Welcome to the Pirates' Hollow!  What?  No where to run?  Hahahahaha!


  Creeping death, starting at your ears...they ring...and feel numb and then
fall off like you've got leprosy...you start to bleed from your ear sockets...
something unseen starts beating your nose into a pulp...then your teeth fall
out...one by one..gum disease sets in...it spreads...your jaw rots and falls
off...your shoulders get a 3rd degree sunburn...they peel...your fingers
tingle...fingernails turn black...hands turn black...arthritis sets in...can't
move hands... belly button itches...can't move hands to scratch...leech crawls
into belly button and starts sucking blood...lice inhabit your pubic hair...a
large rat starts eating away your dead genitals parts...incredible, delicious
pain...you still haven't died, lusting for death to take you away...hair on
legs falls out...toenails are ingrown...big toe starts bleeding and the
toenail cuts in so deep that it starts splitting your toe...you would scream
in agony but your tongue has rotted away...athletes foot occurs...you pray to
end the torture, but you aren't finished yet...your hip dislocates on its
own...kneecaps are shattered...an ambulance drives by slowly, the driver leans
out and laughs at you...then drives off...small children play around your
dying body...they throw pebbles at your decaying carcass...someone drops his
Slurpee on your head, another relieves his bladder on you...they
leave...laughing with disgusting playful joy as your private hell
continues...the night comes...roaches crawl into your ears...you can feel them
eat your eardrums out...a racoon nibbles on your toes...you feel the
vibrations of a fast moving vehicle on the pavement behind you, which you
can't hear because of the roaches...a toad is crawling down your
throat...suddenly, your skull is smashed and blood and bits of brain material
is splatterd and streaked out all over the asphalt as a Ford truck with
~ALUCARD~ on the lisence plate comes at you doing 110 finishing your slow
death as all fades to black.  Final peace.

Doctor, My Doctor, O hast thou seen
The Riders of Roi-Tan, on high floating spleen
Aqua is favored, and yellow is flavored;
What is the color - when black is burning?

Pick yourself plenty, it's time to get ill
When rocking horse violins sound on the hill
Infusing the air with the sound of Tibet,
Except for the tropical species you met,
which resound on a wavelength that matches the X,
And plurdling gabbledyblotchits come next.

       MY REBEL YOUTH
  -======================-


On my Journey through the Land of Else
I realize I cannot stay
This is a place for the young and unknowing
A place to run for the young in their Rebel Youth

Here I sit and think about time of old
Times of daring and adventure
Think back to the time of carefree living and life
With friends of long ago, friends that have gone

A girl so fair stole my heart in an instant
I loved her through four seasons, and we ran
We ran through a field of dandelions
And I lost her upon the wind

In the darkest times of remorse, I wish I had gone
I thought of leaving then and finding my girl
Baby, baby, please stop your calling.  I hear, but cannot come
I've got to close the book of our love....you're gone...I must..

      GOING HOME TO THE RAIN

======================================

Here I stand overlooking the land, of which I live without you, babe
I love you so, and that you know, but baby, baby, I've got to go
I see the sun and it shines in your hair and with your beauty comes my pain
But it's my time, my time to leave, time to say, "I love you"

Don't cry, oh girl, don't cry.  Where I'm going theres too much rain
And in the rain I'll long for you, I'll long to be with you and the sun
I thank you for making my life free, but a man has got to go...into the rain
Baby, baby, save your heart for me....I'll be back one day, you and me...

But now I've got to ramble...
I'm going to answer the call in the rain...

Oh, I once had a girl, a little girl so fair, a princess for me, for sure
We shared our love but that was broken, taken away by fate
Someday I'll be back, I'll search all of time, and one day find my baby
If she's dead as my heart has told, I'll meet her in the sun...

And walk hand in hand, into the sun, overlooking the land
The land in which I'll live with my girl
But now we're torn, torn apart, apart by honour...honour, love, and hate
Don't shed a tear for me, baby.  One day we'll be in the sun

But now I walk into the shadows....I've got to ramble
I'm going home to the rain..........

   INTO THE BLACK
  -==============-


Here I stand.  I wonder who I am.
Here I stand.  I feel the warmth of the sun upon my face.
Here I stand.  Alone.  I know my name.  But why?
Here I stand.  I wonder what it's like out there.  Fear.

For me there is no sight.  I see endless black...warm black.
For me there is no sound.  I hear soft blankness.
I feel people trying to communicate with me...who are they?
Are they beasts?  Do they want to harm me?  Leave me alone!

I ignore these things, and I sink further into my mind.
My mind is my world, my universe, ever expanding.
They pull and touch, so I fall into the black...deepest black.
My world is happy, but you would not understand...

They're pulling harder now.  I resist and fight...and sink.
They give me little food (pain), or none at all.
No matter where I go, I'm never there...in their world.
Stop pulling!  Let me be!  Alone!

They wake me early today.  Today is different...no matter.
They feed me alot...confused.  I simply wonder.
They begin to pull again.  They stick me in the arm.  They stop.
They leave me now...alone.  Alas!  but the black is growing cold.
Quiet.  help?  come back?  i'm sinking too far...into the black......

      SEMPER FI
  -----------------


Fightin in a war;
In the fields of Evermore;
Blood stained dirt;
All that come here get hurt.

Fighting against an enemy;
Who I don't really know;
Shoot first...shoot again;
Widen my grin.

Here we are in fields of pain;
Fighting for the desk jockeys;
Grunts...fighting someone elses battle;
We shoot and kill and die like cattle.

Watching brothers die;
Never a moment to cry;
Grit your teeth and kill them back;
Give them no slack.

Running through the forest dark;
See shadows of men running about;
Run forward into the fight;
Running blind into the night.

Lost all my brothers of war;
Here they lie, they live no more;
Shadows close in and circle around;
I'm confused...like a merry-go-round.

Shadows move closer, the trigger I squeeze;
Bullets whiz by my ear and into the trees;
I hit 6 men and listen to their death scream;
Me and my rifle are supreme!

2 bullets in my arm... 3 in my chest;
Burning pain..gotta live..no time to rest;
I kill 4 more as I limp forward to my doom;
This forest will be my cold, black tomb.

I lay behind a tree and grasp a grenade;
The blood flows fast and footsteps parade;
They close in, I pull the pin...and die;
Semper Fi.

Folks, It's time (the Walrus Said) to speak of other things:
Of shoes and shipz and sealing wacks and Kabbages and Kings
Of why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings!

By which I mean to tell U - OK lets get on with the poetry!!!
But first - I think these Mithrils should stay right where they are because
(i'd like to think) it takes more than yer average dweeb to get here, and we
get less shit posts, like my last one for example.        <Ha Ha>

Doc, I think your Shroom was a subconscious Aqua Phallic Symbol!

Nine coffins wouldn't hold the change
Required to make a copy
Of the book of Life
So don't even
Think about
Pushing
"Enlargement."

Dearest you, girl of blue, spirit red, where are you?
What storms of mood within your head?
Did you go dancing down the hill in sunny dew
With daffodils, bright smiling eyes
Or floral paisleys twice your size
That come like unexpected duck ponds dark?
Oh what wild place have you found now?

You saw it clearly, felt the dream
Of perfect future, lovely life
And meanwhile tottering teetering on the edge
what if it didn't turn out so bright?
And alternate days, you'd wear the face
Of one betrayed by fate, disillusioned
Of she who was let down too late
Though all the others knew before
And never had to fall so far
And while they escalated, you
might pass them on your quick ride down
To nestle in ferns but never crooked treetops.

But take this all to heart, and rise
For up and down is round and round
And all revolves in one sweet whole
Or as one might have put it once,
By taking the rollercoaster tour, you soon end up
Where you wish to be, while others settle out of necessity.

I love you hot, cold, pure, or dirty!
I don't know but gosh you're perty!
Bathe yourself within my laughter
Realize that what I'm after
Means for you and also me
the ultimate tranquility.

The above is dedicated to a girl from Sacto.  Named Liberty (or "Mev").

Do you have a fire within you?
A consuming passion for you-know-not-what?
Does it threaten to halt your whole process of thought
And cause you to stare out in space all the time
Does it keep you from writing, or trying to rhyme
'Cause your thoughts fly so fast you can't put them to word?
Do you feel like you're crazy when it gets so absurd
When you can't even tell what you're trying to say
And instead find your conscience just drifting away
To horizons inside, over oceans of thought
Long forgotten and stifled by the world-view you wrought
-That is, "what your eyes tell you is all that is real,
and sensory info dictates what you feel"
Never mind the clear voice that is screaming inside.
Or how long you've ignored it.  You know you can't hide!
'Cuz sometimes it just grabs you and drives you so wild
That the whole of your knowledge is crammed into a smile
And passers-by see you, and can tell from your eyes
That you've seen something larger than life's greatest prize,
A thing more intense than the great burning sun
And they know that your journey has only begun
And when it's all over, this horrible din,
You will figure out why there's a fire within,
Why you put earthly cares out of mind on a shelf
And instead reach for something of value - your self.

    To myself:
Is this stupid?
Am I being trite? Deluded?

Trees of thought spring up in my mind
I wish to draw them but they grow too fast.
To climb them, first their roots I'll find
...but then the dream's too faint to last.

Flow, my thoughts, and leave my head!
Synapses steal your simple meaning.
Emerge, and take the forms I dread
Will show me where my spirit's leaning.

    No, it's just a bunch of words
    Some of the lines are genuine
    But the rest are made up to rhyme with them
    I should take this energy that
    Wills me to write and instead
    Turn it to skiing

But how then shall I show to others
(AAgh!  Kill! Scream!)  All the turmoil inside?

(What turmoil) I thought I was in peace!?!
with myself.  Ok, so be it.
I bring up opposing forces and exaggerate them
and they have little wars with each other...

All my love is for the sun. (time for a little free association)
But no, it reaches mountains as well.
And what of water?  Love that too?
Is there not and infinite quantity of Love in the world?
Bullshit, what am I saying?
Insanity?  No, I go through this every day.

    Pocket fluff.
    Ten fucking billion tons of fucking pocket fluff.

Somebody speak to me!
Shivers... stopit stopit stopit! and just let me OUT...

My head will inevitably explode.
MU.

I should read something instead.
I should take somebody by the hand and lead them
to where my Self lives.

Oh, I should do this, I should do that
BIG FUCKIN DEAL!  Take a chill pill, self!

Should I show this to anyone?  I don't care.  Damn. Shut up. No, not you...!

Peace. Pace.  Space. Spice. Spine. Pine. Pane. Pain.

Ok this is one I used to tell to the little brat's at this camp I used to be a
councelor at eh.. the kids were all about 9-13 and they would put these
fucking sticks in the fire and then wave them in my face... so I made up this
story with a moral.

Once upon a time, there was this little white rabbit named Hector. He was such
a nice little bunny and he lived in a cage with his nice mommy in a pet store.
Everybody was so happy and they had good food to eat and there cage was always
clean and blaw blaw everything was so perfect and they had lots of fun.

Then one day, a little girl came in with her mother, and walked around looking
for a pet. "MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY" she started shrieking, "I WAN THIS ONE MOMMY"
and she pointed at Hector! The pet store owner came over and lifted Hector out
of the cage, and put him in a box with holes all over it! Hector was taken
away from his mother and she started to cry. haha

The little girl put Hector in an very small 1 foot by 1 foot steel cage by her
window and poked and prodded poor hector and yelled at him and dressed him up
in doll clothes, and torchered him! Poor Hector...haha He was very very
unhappy!

Then one day, by mistake, the little girl was careless and left the cage ajar,
and left the window open. As soon the girl left, Hector made his break for it,
and jumped out the window...except the only problem was, it was on the 3rd
story! And Hector fell on the rocks below at a trmendous rate of speed. Boom.
He just lay there for a second with blood coming out his nose.

BUT HE WAS STILL ALIVE!

hector got up and ran across the yard! BUT - he didn't know there would be
dobermans! They chase hýéim to the fence, and bit off one of his legs as he
tried to jump over!!! Blood was spurting out everywhere!! But he ran...still.

Because HE WAS STILL ALIVE!!!

Hector ran as fast as his 3 little feet would carry him...across the fiels,
but, he didn't see the hawk that came down after him, because he was in so
much pain! The hawk ripped all the skin and muscle off hectors back!! Blood
was spurting and was getting in Hector's eyes so he couldn't see!

But HE WAS STILL ALIVE!!! so he continued to run as fucked up as he was.

Poor little Hector ran onto the road trying to get into the safe woods beyond,
when A HUGE 18 wheelin semi Flattened him - squirting his insides in all
directions!!! Poor hector couldn't see it coming.

But, HE WAS STILL ALIVE!!

He lay there for days - The vultures came down and picked at him, the flys
came and lay maggots in him, and he dried out from the sun....and the winds
blew half of him away...but still, a few brain cells lived on and hector was
still there....

HE WAS STILL ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THEN a boy scout came along one night, collecting sticks, and picked poor
hector up!!! And took jim back to the camp fire, and BURNED HIM!

HECTOR WAS DEAD!!!

The moral of the story is that the very stick that you are waving in my face,
could be someones PET and even a nice little bunny rabbit. So Quit before I
put you in the fire...



Well it was something like that.... ok I guess it was pretty lame.

Prince of Yesterday
-------------------

I was a Prince of young, a man with the soul of the wind
I ran across the world with no cares upon my shoulders
I travelled through time without a thought of destination

One day I sat on a rock and looked upon the ocean,
And with my hands filled with the sands of time I saw
And I stayed there

Now I am a King of wisdom, my soul is that of the mountain
I've listened to the time of my past and heard I did
The time will come for all, and they'll shed the tear as I

The days of the prince have past and there is no going back
With the tear of knowledge and a pain for youth here I sit
I'm still on the same rock and forever will stay

Here I'll sit with my friend, oh, I love Her so
We live on this rock and watch you, did you know?
Come by anytime and let me see you grow
Nevermind my eyes and the secrets they hold
Someday, my Prince, someday you'll know
