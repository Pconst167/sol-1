Whats this---->  P

It's a Purple Worm!  Watch out....they sometimes swallow you.  If you kill
this worm, ya know what ya get?  ha.  A purple microdot!  What class is this
under?  Well, Potions of course!  If you blindfold yourself, eat a floating
eye, and quaff a potion of microdot....then you can instantly be teleported to
the Wizard Of Yendor and his Hellhound Phydeaux.  And if you repeat this
process, you will find yourself armed with a +7 crysknife and a AC of -18,
and the strength of a god.  Repeat the process and you will receive a level
of your own at # 69 filled with about 200 wands of wishing....23 wands of
polymorph, 45 scrolls of taming, 9980 Amulets of Yendor, a tin of floating
eye, 8545 potions of gain level, and 1 piece of gold.

*- Things to do with a Ring of Polymorph control and a ring of Polymorph -*


Turn into a aqua coloured shroom!  Which will stand out like a missle base,
when placed in reality.  And a young fair girl is bound to come by and pick
you from the ground.  And when she sees "Eat Me" written all over your grin.
She will....and then your in control of a magic mushroom inside a brain!  What
FUN!

Or turn into a grain of heroin and be shot via hypo needle into some persons
vein!  Talk about roller coaster rides!  Theres no fun like that!

Or turn into a purple coloured shroom, which Alice is sure to find first.
Then when She reaches down to pick you, pop up and give her a kiss!!  I love
doing that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then she'll tell you a secret....

Turn into a Pressed Rat and you can impersonate him at some fancy restaurant
where he is supposed to meet Alice!  Then you can meet her!

Turn into a syringe that reads: Shoot Me!



Never get a one way ticket going the wrong way.

Hmmmmmmm.......a very shrubbish planet.  I mean to say, it's very flowery.
What I mean is it's very gardinish.  Uh, very bushy.  What I meant say to say
was, its very rOOoooooooooooooouuuuuuNNNNNNNNNddddddd.

> Scan for Life


Senors show that there is Life, sir!!  Closer examination reveals that they
are a highly intelligent species, and in turn are very primitive and evolved.
But it seems that the species has directed it's entire existence to performing
Lobotomies.  They have lived this way for so long (approxamently 67.993
billion secro years.) that they have adapted an addiction, and absolutely MUST
perform a lobotomy on a live specimen!  If they try to fight the erge, their
body goes into convulsions within a 6 hour period, until it die of heart
failure.  So you can see, that living with or next to any of these terrestrial
life forms just may prove hazardous.  [Do YOU know your neighbors??]  As I was
saying, Captain....because of this species unconditional MUST to lobotomise
live specimen/persons (usually their own race), which has kept total
population of the species, at 12,900 and a half.  And very dangerous.

>Hmmmm.  Try communicating with them.


I've sent a CPST (Communicating Party Squad Troop).

>Ok.

OH MY GOD!!  CAPTAIN, 98% OF THE CREW HAS BEEN LOBOTOMIZED!!!!!!!!
Captain, they ship came back with 13 emotionless zombies and 2 unharmed men.
Lord, that was tragic.

>Send the two unharmed men to debriefing room #77.  Send all of the injured
men and de-lobotomize them.

But, Captain...you CAN'T De-Lobotomize someone.

>........oh.  Well, send them to Art classes and record all of their works.

Yes, Captain.  And may I add....that was a GREAT decision.  And shall I inform
their families?

>no.  Keep it a very big, dark, secret for years and years.  If this got out
we would be demoted down to janitor.  This is just like that damn incident
with the genetic limb multiplyer serum.

Yes, terrible lose, Sir.......

>So don't tell a soul.  And I'll be monitoring your mail for the next month.
 In fact, identify yourself at THIS moment!  Switch to Monitors!

         You're on your own down there.


>Very Well.  Please send a Vixen maid up to my room for my daily brain scan.
 Oh, and what about the two unharmed soldiers?


Uh....um, they were accidently killed in transport from the docking bay to the
interrogation room.  It seems that one of the guard dropped his billy club and
one of the studies tripped on it and fell with a fatal concussion.  And as he
was falling down he grabbed onto study #2 and in turn, HE tripped and rolled
down the hallway and was picked up by a Hallway Garbage Drone, who through him
into the Waste shaft.  he was shot out into open space, and imploded.  It was
as equally a disgusting site to look at, as it was to collect the remains and
dispose of it properly.  You see the bloody imploded remains floated right in
front of the pre-school playgroud bubble, the church of valex nuit, the
mayors office, the union for freedom of animals, the senior citizens bingo
tournaments, and the Shawn-Da-Lay Boy newstand on 27th and Hayte.

>Your fired.  Please kill yourself imedietely.

Yes, Sir!  Goodbye!

<Sssssshhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiifffffffffffffffttttttttttttttttttt>




   Prologue:

              And as it turned out....these lobotomized artists from the
planet GidKrupit manage to construct the Scribes of the Wise Council!  Which
now resides in the possession of the goddess Isabeau.  Aka: The BIG Book, The
Bible of Else, The Book.  All of the artists died off about 100 years ago.
 The Gid's tried to duplicate the process but to no avail.  So they went back
to the planet of the lobotomizing species, but have yet to even get within 10
feet of a lobotomizer without being dropped to the ground and lobotomized with
the greatest agility, their incisions are cut with fine tune severs, their
stitchings like that of the most professionaly trained surgeon.  Not a single
Capture party has succeded!  To this day the secrets of Lobotomy remain a
mystery.  Is Lobotomy the Answer?

Why of COURSE it is, dood...........................<zone...>
