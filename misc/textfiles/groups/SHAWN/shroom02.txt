Hey, babe....take a walk on the soft side. Walk upon the shallow waters of
Else and watch the waves splash on the orange rox and roll over the bright red
sand.  Hazzy Dazzy!

Hey, you...ya gotta spend more time in the water!

No way!  There are sharks in the water....

Yeah, so?  Ever here of a Land shark, stupid?

Hey I resent that!

Who does?

I do.

You?

Yes.

Me?

Yes.


AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

     I am a cloud waving good-bye to it's celestrial mother!


                I fish out of air.  Black air. Smooth, silent, crisp, cool,
black air.  If it could only be bottled......


Wow, cut your circulation off until you feel the warmth of the blood trying
to push through!  It's neato.

Instantaneous RUSH!  RUuuuUUuuUUuUUuUuUuuuuuUUSH!  AaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhH
ahhaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaH!

Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeekinnn,,,,,,whoa boy.  I'm just on the edge of dropping
off into totaly limbo.  It's amazing cuz I can still type.  But my mind is
like swirling in it's juices.  And I'm a puppet of that Blue.  That Aqua Blue.
Yeah, it comes in all kinds......of.....species.  That bitchen bluuuuuuueeee.
Ya know it ain't just quite RIGHT.  Well, iiit's right but not like right,
right?   pp-p---ppppppp--peeeeeekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkuuuuuunnnnnnnnnn.  aaaahhhhh

I just shifted.  It's a good thing I was wearing my headfones or I'd be
one....one....uh.........what was I sayin?  Who the fuck is Golem?
Hey, it's a bitch and moan yesterday!  Did you miss your black hole today?  I
think you did!  WHOA!  The kkkkkeyboard just shifted on me!!  It did a 360
under my fingertips!  Or was that my brain did a -360?  Whoa..time for another
tape....ok:

> We are setting all controls to Left Side Of Tapedeck!

> We are about to launch, Captain!

go for it...

> LAUNCHING!

(ok...in very unstable state at the moment, sir...please hold....)

> Ok, Captain!  We seem to have made it.....although our controls are shaking
a bit....it seems that Blue was a little more BLUE than we thought.  It's ok
though, Captain because we seem to have stabalized the controls on a surface
and then the shaking went into our bbbbbrainsss...and we're now floating.  And
it seems our destination has changed....our original course was set to LZ-1,
but our current postition is orbiting the Dark Side Of The Moon...go figure,
eh Cap?

And what color is the moon?

>  Well Cap'n......it's no color....it's a blank page on the foreground of the
Universe.  Captain....we all thought you would have known that...


Uh...uh....I meant to ask you what color was the...the....warning
becon.....yeah...don't you know ANYTHING??

>  Oh, I see.  Our fault.  So, Cap....what do you think about t


<<<<<<DANGER DANGER>>>>>>>>

     <<<<<<<THERE WAS A SHIFT>>>>>>>

            "Attention all crew:  There is no cause for alarm.  We just seem
to be having a few Shift's now and again.  It could be that Blue thats hanging
out with you at the moment.  That Bitchen Blue?  Anyhow....you can exppect
these Shifts on and off for about the next 5 or 6 hours.  Return to your
duties....whatever you do up there."


>  Bad news.  THose Shifts are UN cool.  They are like the TRUE meaning of UN.
Whoa....the controls are slightly shaking again.  Wait, I see a pattern!!!
First the Shifts......and then the Shakes!  And the Peeks come at any ranDOm
moment..uuuhhhuuhuhuhuhhhh, like nOW....please hold..


<<<<<<<Pausing for maximum Peek>>>>>>>

Hmmm, it seems the Peek isn't going away.  We're on a PEEK for the duration!
Whoa!

(Captains Note:  Peek.....not Peak, mind you...there IS a difference...)


>  So we our like constantly Peeking then?

Uh, yes.  Isn't that neat?  it's like your riding a massive Wave, D00D.

> Is it?  Neat. I've never been on a Wave.  And what is a D00D?

Never mind.

>  Excuse us for a sec, Cap....there seems to be this erie glow coming from
the light fixture and we are going in for a closer look/examination.  It's a
bitchen Black Light, it is....

Ok.


<<<<<Pausing for examination of the  great light fixture in sKy>>>>


> Ok, we're back.  Our controls are shaking a bit.  It' seems that exerting
pressure causes our controls to shake.

How brilliant of you.

> Hmmm.  Well, the light fixture was neat and all, but we seemed a bit
unstable uppppp there so we came back down.  We like looking at it from here
anyway, Cap'n.   Ya mind?


Me?  No not at all.  Whatever makes you happy.  Whatever gets yer rox off,
pal.  Pals?

> Yeah...pals..  After all there are about 30 billion of us up here.


That many, huh?


> Yeah, THAT many.


Hmm, we should talk more often.  Lets do lunch!


> yeah, right, ok. Lets do lunch....

<<<<<<PPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEKKKKK STATION>>>>>>>>>>


>  There go our controls again.......hey there hasn't been a Shift in awhile.
Hmmm.  Ya never can tell whats gonna happen next....eh Joey?  Joey?
Damn....where'd ya go?  You all look so much alike.  Like....me....geez.


Are you ok?  Nevermind..,...read that backwards so you didn't hear it.


>  Boy...your an intelligent one, aren't you?

HEY...watchit or I'll.....I'll.......I'll send some more BLUE your way!!


>Go ahead...

How bout a little blast of Black Air, smart ass?

>  Uh....umm..go ahead...mmmm....see if...uf    www  we  care?

funny.  Aren't we just the little punster tonight...

>  Oh.  Well....I didn't mean it that way.  Umm, Cap`n?  We're gonna go for a
little stroll into the black hole since the controls are shakin a bit too
much.  We`ll contact you when we get back, ok?


Yeah, yeah....bust a gut..


> uh huh.  Bye nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwww



<<<<DANGER DANGER............


>  That'll fix YOU, ya idiot!


>> Uh, Jim...the meters are reading a little high.

>  Uh huh.  Thats what the dumb Computer said.

>> But it's true!

> Ask me if I care.

>> Do you care?

> You really went and asked me didn't you?  NO!  I DON'T CARE!  Do YOU feel
threatens by the meters?  Just take a moment to decide...

>>  Ummmm.....not...really.

>  Good.  Then that's settled.  Lets go for that walk....

>> Righto!


<<<<OPENING DOOR FOR A WALK THROUGHT THE BLACK HOLE>>>>>
