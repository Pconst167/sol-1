									   ...PART III OF ROBBING HOUSES
=============================================================================
		    CREATED, WRITTEN, AND TESTED BY VIDEO VINDICATOR
=============================================================================

INTRODUCTION

  Hello and welcome, to the conclusion of the Robbing Houses Trilogy (Boy, I
am starting to feel like one of those Dragonlance Authors).  I'm back, and
with a vengence towards all authority and law... Shit, who needs 'em?  Ok,
this is a followup to the first two which dealt mainly with private home
burgalery, which can be profitable and fun, but not nearly as in the case
of commercial burgaleries (Forgive the mispelled title, but 2 M's just would
NOT fit!).  Fortunantly for us, the theives of todays modern world, laws
help to protect us from the laws which we willingly violate.  On the average
commercial burgalers get half to one-third the punishment of those who do
home robberies.  Why is this? you might ask... Well, it's simple... The laws
are the same, but our loving government doesn't frown upon infringing upon
a business, as much as that of an individual.  And since in most cases these
types of crimes are the plea-barganers dream, you rarely see a jury trial.
The more personal explanation is this, a person (including the judge) looks
at someone who breaks into family homes like this "Hmmm... If I don't throw
the book at him, he might break into my house.", whereas with businesses its
more like this "Hmmm... I never really liked Radio Shack anyways...".  Well,
you get the general idea, residental burgaleries tend to hit too close to
home (oh, what an awful pun!). Most of the same techniques apply to these
type of breakins, although for the most part they tend to be easier.
  I have one question to pose for all you deviants out there... Why is it
almost all the fraud-only groups turn out lame?  Hmmm, the world may never
know.  Make sure to check out the other files I've written, and your nearest
H/P dealer...
  As usual this carries the official Video Vindicator disclaimer, which
basically states I take full responsibity for manipulating you into breaking
into businesses, and I really secretly placed subliminal messages in my
ASCII title art.  Ok course, I take ABSOLUTELY NO responsibility for any
legal uses found within this file, and make no claims, applied or real, 
towards the true existance of God.  Thank you for your time.


PLUS'S TOWARDS COMMERCIAL BREAKINS

  One of the most evident advantages of breaking into businesses is the fact
that most likely after hours it will be deserted, and you pretty much have
a good idea of when the people are slated to arrive the next day.  This
leaves out the always-present fear that someone will stumble into you why
you're having a little uninvited party.
  Another plus to businesses is the fact that they tend to have just what
you're looking for, since you pick them specifically for that purpose.  And
everyone knows new merchandise is much easier to sell than 'previously-
owned' stuff.
  Businesses also tend to have either great locations, are great back
entrances into them.  This can make your life alot easier.  Some older ones
it could be possible to go in through the ceiling.  Never pass this over,
since it bypasses all primary security systems (but not motion...).
  The benefits, in my option, tend to outweight the ones involved in home,
and tied in with the fact that they both share the same risk, but one a
lesser punishment, is enough for me.  Most of the file, I recap a couple of
place's I've hit, and how I did them, so you can do them in your area.  Make
sure you have a reason to hit each one, and try to change your MO (Method of
Operation) fairly ofter.  Like go in through the window of one, then the
roof of the other, etc...


AHHH... RADIO SHACK

  I just HAD to break into this joke, since they always brag to customers
about their 'high-tech' security system.  What a laught.  First off, locate
the phone lines out.  Unusally they are located on the top of the building,
although some are on the side.  Now, cut EVERY fucking wire in the thing...
Wow, no phone - no call... Pretty simple, huh?  Next take and hit the main
window with the crowbar, the alarm won't go off for 15-30 sec (depending on
weither they can figure out how to set it).  During this time break the rest
of the glass out of the window, so it isn't quite so obvious that its broken.
Now run and hid somewhere that you can watch it from, after about 10 minutes
the alarm will reset and stop.  Now, Radio Shack is the only place you can
do this type of raid on, since their system main bell is located inside the
building, SEVERLY limiting the effective sound range, and combined with the
fact it's probably in a business district, no one should be around to hear
it's faint sounds.  I personally prefer Friday or Saturday night around 11 or
12, since the cops are occupied elsewhere busting parties.  Next, after the
alarm resets, and you're sure that there is noone coming to pay you a visit,
jump in through the window and run back into the storage area, this is
usually where the bell is located.  It should start up again shortly, but
this time grab the bell and/or wires and rip the damn thing down.  Now you
have successfully disarmed their best alarm system.  I personnally feel a
little more gratification by smashing the unit itself with the crowber, just
for added effect.  Now just rape the place and get out.  Nothing could be
simpler.
  Now here's one advantage to picking Radio Shack as one of your first hits,
if you go in before, usually 2 or 3 weeks, you can ask any question that
comes to mind concerning their alarm (and getting around it) to any of their
highly trained (Ya, right.), professional salestaff.  This way you can see
if their system differs from any of the ones I've hit.
  Some things that you should definantly get while in there are the following
items: A Police Scanner (the 20 channel version), 4 good walkie-talkies (in
case you want to include some others on your next raid), their 386-sx laptop
computer (for hacking, since it you're forced to leave it somewhere, at least
you only left a fucking Tandy), and anything else that might be benefical
to an up-and-coming criminal.


UNITED PARCEL SERVICE (UPS)

  UPS is GREAT.  This place doesn't know the meaning of the word security.
I hit these losers 8 times before they finally caught on!  This is a good
job for all those who don't want to physically go into a building, but still
want a lot of shit.  UPS is kinda like a free-for-all in a mall, since you
don't know what the hell you're going to find in the trucks.  Anyways, heres
what you do.
  UPS has this nasty habit of parking their semi's full of packages in the
back of their parking lot on Saturday night.  One note, Saturday is the ONLY
night you can do this, since they open and close so damn late every other
night.  Anyways, all you do is take a bolt cutter with you, and pick a good
looking semi in the back... Cut the little lock-ie-thing (it's not a real
lock, just some wierd reusable metal thingy), slide the back open and WALA,
you're in!  Like I said, security?  I found it was best to just say forget
neatness and jump into the back, throwing out boxes that you don't want.
Now, I personally look at the return address, if it sounds like something
I'm interested, I toss it into the back of the car, if not, on the ground
it goes.
  One variant you might want to try (which I have not), would be to insure
some empty box for a totally high amount, and send it Saturday afternoon (so
you know it's in the semi), then look specifically for it.  When it's gone,
UPS forks over the insured value... in cash... very convienient.
  UPS also seems to loop security blankly in the face, and place their office
in the middle of nowhere... Making it very obvious for you if anyone is
approaching.  I personally would have 3 people on a job like this.  One would
be in the truck, searching through the boxes.  One would be sorting through
the one he throws down, and placing them in the vehicle.  The final would be
waiting in the vehicle, listening to scanner to have a little warning if
any pig got the idea to come out and nose around.  Only the first two should
be in walkie-talkie contact, but the third should have easy access to one,
so he doesn't get distracted from the scanner by the first two talking.  You
can look at up to 6 hours there safely!  Make sure to case it out first so
you have a good idea of just how long you really do have.
  Here's a little side note on all the times I did it.  The first three times
were fine, but on the fourth they placed the semi's back-to-back, so you
can't get it.  So solve this, cut the hydrolic cables at the front, on both,
and they will 'kneel' so you can get it!  On the fifth attempt type moved
all the semi's into the building and left the little brown trucks outside,
so I went around and vandalized EVERY one.  Needless to say, the semi's were
out the next weekend, but so were the cops, so I skipped that one.  Finally
they wised up, paid their people mass-overtime, and cleaned out the semi's
before I got there... So hopefully you can apply this to your own situation.


THE POST OFFICE

  You probably are thinking, Why the hell you would you want to break into
the post office?  Well, the answer is simple, you see, every PO is your area
has a postal key, which will open EVERY big blue mailbox, EVERY apt complex
letterboxes, EVERY place a postman might go!  It's a large, easy to duplicate
key that looks kinda like this:

			##	  	    ##		####
		   ####      ##   ###	   ########  This is like a VERY crude
		#######    ####   #####     ##### ##  drawing of what they actually
		################################# ##  look like, but you get the
		#######    ####   #####     ##### ##  general idea.  It's about 3x
		   ####      ##   ###	   ########  the size of a normal key.
		     ##   	    ##		####

The left side is just a mirror image of the right.  You could easily copy it
if you have a shop class and access to like those metal folders and cutters.
Usually it is kept towards the back of the PO, in a big chain-link cage...
Which you can cut through with bolt cutters.  Once again, like UPS, choose to
do it on a Saturday night, so you have no fear of being discovered.  There
are some negative and positive things about this place that I should mention,
It is a federal building, so therefore a federal offense when breaking in...
So roughly translated what this means is don't get caught.  The plus is no
matter how many times you break in, they will never put in an alarm, and they
will only strengthen security the way you got in (just as stupid as UPS).  I
remember the first time we broke in, we went in through the back door, it
opened out, so we just removed the little hing-things and took the door off.
The second time they made a door that opened in, but made out of cheap wood,
so we kicked it in.  The third time they made it a steel door, but they left
a fucking window in it, so we broke the window and reached in to unlock it.
The fourth time they made an all-steel door, no window, so we went in through
a cheap skylight in the roof.  The fifth (yes, five fucking times!) we just
smashed one of the windows on the side and went in through that.  The post
office was like on of out little hobbies... There really wasn't much to take,
but it sure was fun breaking in!
