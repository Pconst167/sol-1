INTRODUCTION/INSTRUCTIONS

  Welcome yet another file by your truely, Video Vindicator!  This wonderful
file will hopefully be updated by me every 4-6 months, or sooner if I see an
immediate need.  What it basically is, and does for you, is identify any
account you may have, or pull up... Not only does it do this, but it also
supplies you with quite a few accounts (minus the pw's) to play with...
The first bit of 2 letter identifiers tell you what the specific account is,
so If you decide you need to inquire in the form of an Auto company, that
is possible.  Any of them that start with a (?) are not definant what they
are, but my best guess is what is listed.  Any that say UNKNOWN are fairly
self-explanitory.  Make sure to verify the freshness of this wonderful file
by the date in the upper left hand corner of my title.  This is the sister-
file to the Carding, My Way Trilogy, but can be used as a stand-alone file
for all those striving for a higher awareness through CBI (Although they
have changed their name to Equifax, they will always remain CBI in my heart).
  As with all my files, I claim full responsibility for everything contained
herein, and make no hesitation to support and illegal use of this info.

  If you do a pullup which has an inquiry or account with either a ID I don't
have and/or an account/merchant name, please leave me mail so I can update
the next release.  Remember, CBI Accounts are port-specific, so do not
attempt to use any of these ID's at any port outside of their area.  This
would most likely cause the early demise of the account.


COMPANY ACCOUNTS/MERCHANT NAMES

  One note on all the below accounts.  If the merchant name appears in all
CAPS then it has not been verified, and is just a retype of the CBI 8 char
identifier.  If anyone has any leads to the true identities of these comps,
please notify me.

    FIRST GROUP NUMBER/STATE

  Ok, this will hopefully help you locate the state from which each account
origionates.  Unfortunately I have just started compiling this aspect of the
file, so it will be somewhat meager... As always, the ones that start with
a (?) are not all that positive.

                          146 - (?) Colorado
                          162 - California
                          164 - Nevada

                          906 - (?) New Jersey


CONCLUSION

  Well, I hope this file serves you in all your future indevors, and that
you cause as much trouble as humanly (and inhumanly) possible.  Be watching
for even MORE files from me (mainly along the lines of fraud) in the near
and distant future.  As always, you comments and suggestions are welcomed
and requested.  If there is enough of a demand, I will also start appending
a list of valid ports, and which account location ranges are valid at them.
Get in contact with me wherever I am, and I will attempt to respond to you
as soon as possible.  Special thanks to all those who made this file
possible, but especially to: The White Rider, Maximum Overdrive, The Sparrow,
The Visionary, Strato Viper, and, of course, anyone whom I forgot!  And
remember... Let Fraud be the salvation of your dismal life!
