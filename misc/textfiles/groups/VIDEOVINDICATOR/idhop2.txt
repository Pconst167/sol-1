INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Welcome to the second part of the Identity Hoping series!  This file will
cover more of the forging aspect of identity fraud then the actual 'hoping',
as the first file did.  For the most part, you want to use these documents that
you can purchase through the mail to get real state-issued ones... The nice
thing about getting fraugulent identities it that once it starts it can grow
on it's own and doesn't need to be nurtured.  Almost all of the companies listed
below are still open (I say almost because if I say all, one if bound to close)
so you should have little trouble with them.  I include the address's mainly
because you will want to write and get a brochure from them... It's one thing
to trust my rating of the documents, it's another to just blow your money.
  In this file I think I'm going to leave out my normal disclaimer, and just
sum it up in four little words... I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.  What this means
is that if little Johnny down the street is able to buy a gun due to a fake ID
he learned to make through this, then so what?  I didn't like Johnny anyways
and he just saved me the trouble of doing it for him!  hahaaha... Ok, enough
with the bullshit.
  For this file we will assume there are three types of alternate ID's: forged,
borrowed, and created.  Each type is better for a different type of situation,
and they all have their own inherant weaknesses, unless done properly.  This
file will cover primarily Forged ID's, although we will touch briefly on Created
ID's as well.  For more information on Borrowed, please refer to part one of
this series.
  Forged ID's are still in use today to some degree, altough they are mainly
used to either help in the ability to drink sooner, or sone other rite of
society.  These can also be used in a lower level for credit card fraud, and
many other types of fraud, as well as to back up a created identity quickly
and easily.  This use has recently been hampered by the introduction of new
ID technology.  This is bad in ways, but it's uses are far from over... Just
because California has adopted Credit Card DL's, doesn't mean that Oregan has,
and what Oregan doesn't know/do, can only help you!

                                   
MAILORDER COMPANIES & YOU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Below is a listing of mailorder ID companies, after the name of each company
will be a number (from 1 to 10, 10 being highest) rating the quality of the
ID's or whatever the specific company sells.  Most of them will send you a free
catalog if you send them a SASE (a self-addressed stamped envelope, for all the
worthless people who didn't know what that ment), but don't expect fast service
from any of these (except NIC, who is exceptionally good).  For the most part
all of these companies are the sort of grey-area companies that only last for
a couple years in the fun world of legitimacy, so they might be here today,
but most likely gone tommorow...

    COMPANY NAME      RATING BRIEF DESCRIPTION
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    BAIRD COMPANY       5   This company sells somewhat generic ID's, including
    PO BOX 444              Special Forces, Swat, Mercenary, etc... The only
    LOS ALAMITOS, CA        thing that really sets this company appart is the
    90720-0444              quality & selection of Badges & Patches (quite nice)
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------

    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    A. L. BERTACCI      6   All this person sells is a two-piece photo ID card
    724 MYSTIC AVE          with any state name you want typed on.  One nice
    GRETNA, LA              feature of this card is it has a spot for both a
    70056                   Signature, DOB, and ID number...
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CARDINAL PUBLISHING 7   This company sells very nice blank certificates
    PO BOX 5200             with a very real looking gold seal.  They also sell
    JACKSONVILLE, FL        ID's, but they saw 'NOT A GOVERNMENT DOC' all over.
    32247
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CALVARY FELLOWSHIP  9   If you want to fake like you're a priest, this is
    316 CALIFORNIA AV 435   the place to by the Certificates.  They make you
    RENO, NV                minister for the 'Ministry of Salvation', or the
    89509                   'Victory New Testament Fellowship'.
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CALEDONIA           7   This place sells State Name ID cards which are very
    PO BOX 2940             nice.  They even have a color bar behind the state
    DEARBORN, MI            name.  Only drawback is there is no ID # space.
    48123
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CITY NEWS SERVICE   5   This company sells decent bogus press cards.  As of
    PO BOX 39               this writing they only have three different models,
    WILLOW SPRINGS, MO      but claim to have more on the way soon.
    65793
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    L.W. CRAIG ASSOC.  10   This place has one of the best Birth Certificates
    PO BOX 40188            and Univerity Certificates I have seen around.  They
    EVERMAN, TX             have a wide selection, and I would suggest writing
    76140                   for a catalog from this company.
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CROWN PUBLISHING    9   This place is pretty lame other than they have a
    2400 W COAST HWY M-38   California Drivers License that looks JUST LIKE
    NEWPORT BEACH, CA       the old one!
    92663
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CASTELLANIA        10   Probably one of the most interesting things in here,
    PO BOX 40201            this company sells supporting docs for a completely
    PASADENA, CA            fake country!  From Passports to Birth Certs.
    91104      818-794-6013
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    DELTA PRESS         6   They sell some fairly nice ID's, especially fake
    PO BOX 1625             Police/Sheriff kits!  Do not confuse this with the
    EL DORADO, AK           Delta Press that makes books...
    71731      501-862-4772
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    IFPO                9   This sells some really hot Photographer ID's and
    PO BOX 18205            some of the same Press cards everyone else has.
    WASHINGTON, DC          One nice thing this place sells though is complete
    20036-8205              credential kits...
    ------------------+----+----------------------------------------------------
    CHURCH OF REMNANT  10   This place sells some AWESOME Delayed certificates
    PO BOX 557              of Birth, Social Security Cards, and a great copy
    MOUNDS, OK              of the Oklahoma Drivers License!
    74047

Overall there isn't too much in the way of differences between the cards these
companies supply.  They all are forced to be processed in about the same method
and therefore don't leave much room for deviance.  Almost all the companies I
listed don't include the shit phrase 'NOT A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT', but this
could change any day, so don't count on it... Check it out first.


NIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPLY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Don't let the name scare you away, this company has the WIDEST selection of
ID's of any company I've come across, and they are all very high quality... How
good you ask?  Well, good enough for the company to get it's own listing in
here!  They sell everything from Books (like Palidan Press sells), to police
badges, to certificates, to bulletproof briefcases, to great ID kits.  Here's
a list of what they sell in the way of Certificates and ID's.  This company is
one of the very few that accepts Visa or MC, but they are very wise to the ways
of fraud, so don't waste their time or yours and just buy the damn things!

One note of Folios, these are AWESOME!  They are the best looking ID's you'll
EVER find, they are two-piece ID's that are identical to the ones this company
(yup, they supply the government) supplies the government with!  Hows that for
HOT!  When ordering these you need to tell them what info to put on, because
these are totally custom and they write you're name on them for you!
  Everything I have gotten from this company I've been really pleased with, and
they have a guarentee that is AWESOME as well.  If you fuck up on the ID some-
how, just send a SASE with the messed up on in it, and they'll replace it for
FREE!  How's that for a deal!
  The Specialty Cards this company makes are also VERY nice, and most have room
left open for DOB, SSN, etc... One other nice feature about this company is that
most of the cards are multi-color, which adds to the realism, and some of them
have information written on both the front AND back.
  This company will also make custom ID's to match any specifications, all you
need do is send in a photocopy of the origional, and tell them the info to put
on it.  The wait is usually around 48 hours and there is an additional charge
of five dollars... Not much considering.  These can be customized to look like
just about anything, from a Police ID to a fake Mickey Mouse Fanclub Membership.


COMPARING TO THE REAL THING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  There is an interesting little company based in Redwood City, California
that issues yearly a little book that shows detailed color photo's and other
information on drivers license's for all 50 states!  The companies called
'Driver's License Guide Company', and they will sell to anyone with money!
Many DMV and Highway Patrol officiers suscribe to this book and use it to tell
if it's a fake or now... Well, we all know that is a two way street!


MAKING YOUR OWN, LIKE THE PROS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Below is a list of companies that make machines which produce ID's.  These
companies will not be too pleased if you call up and say "Do you sell machines
to make fake ID's?".  Alot of these companies are the ones who actually supply
the government with their ID making machines (like Polaroid), and just remember,
your home make ID can say and look like anything you want...

They basically process the information in two ways; One type makes a one piece
ID, with everything transfered over to a photo (like the polaroid, this is the
same machine California used to use before switching over to those damn credit
card ID's), the other way is to just glue the picture onto the paper and then
laminate.  A good cop will be able to tell a fake from the real thing fairly
quickly, so be wary...


ANCILLARY DOCUMENTATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  These are great little things that you can usually easily get, but are not
enough to support a fake identity... But, without these, a fake identity will
seem shallow, so you will always want to have at lease two or more of these in
your wallet at all times...

    BUSINESS CARDS - For around $20 you can get 500 cards printed up with any-
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   thing from President on down written on them.  These are
                     usually accepted readily, after all, who would bother to
                     print up fake business cards?
    LIBRARY CARD   - These are extremely easy to get, normally requiring two
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~     forms of identification.  They add respectability to you.
    SCHOOL ID'S    - You can usually get these with one or no ID, by simply
    ~~~~~~~~~~~      signing up for a class at the start of a semester.
    SS CARDS       - Social Security Cards are steadily becoming the national
    ~~~~~~~~         identifier, whether or not we want them to be.
    RETURN IF LOST - These come free with the wallet and are GREAT to fill out
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   with your fake info, after all, if it were a fake, why would
                     you fill this out?
    PHOTOGRAPHS    - Always carry photographs of you wife, your children, your
    ~~~~~~~~~~~      dog, someone else's wife, someone else's children, etc...
    MEMBERSHIP CARD- These can be obtained either by joining a heath club or
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  other organization.  Unusally these will req 1 ID...
    INSURANCE CARDS- These are great and usually very easy to get.  Many comps
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  will send you a very nice credit card type card when you
                     send them asking for more information.
    PERSONNALIZE   - Personnalizing the wallet is probably THE best apparant/
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~     subtle method of substanciating your claims.  After all,
                     who other than the owner would have a monogramed wallet?


AGEING DOCUMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In most cases, with a forged social security card, or birth certificate, it
is benifical to age the document, since how many people do you know that own
one that just came off the printing press?  There are many methods to do this,
but here are two of the easiest.
  First, after the certificate is completed, and the ink dry, let it sit in
direct sunlight for about one day.  Then take the document and dip it in water,
then returning it to it's previous position.  Wait around seven to ten days
and the document will have the apperance of aging considerably.
  Second, and probably a little better (but works best when done first and then
followed with step one (minus the water part)), is to make a weak tea solution,
and letting it soak in there until the desired color is attained.  After this
then fold it several times and it will make very aged looking creases'.
  When numbering a birth certificate, remeber to use the proper tools of the
era for which the certificate was issued.  So if you're doing a pre-1980 one
(which I am assuming, since you have a grasp of reading) then you will not want
to use a new typewritter, but an IBM Selectric (which was the government stnd.
before 1980).  Also you will not want to use a ball point pen on the document,
since these also were not created at this peticular point in time.  You must
always take these into account, because as fate would have it you'll end up
getting the only smart government employee in the world!

    
BIRTH CERTIFICATES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Because in the discrepancy and relative ease of forgery, most government
agencies will not accept a birth certificate or photocopy of one unless it has
impressive documentation that it is a certified copy and/or filed by the county
clerk.  Passport agencies will normally not accept a copy unless it has an
embossed seal from the state or county it was issued from.
  People rarely will take the origional birth certificate with them, usually
they will have certified photocopy of the document.  What this means is that
the government certifies that this is a legal document... Wow.  Ok, usually
this is an imbossed stamp with the state's seal in the center of the stamp.
There is NO standard format for certificate stamps, and every county in the
United States has a different one, so who's to know if Bumfuck, TX's stamp
looks like a smily-face or not?  There is no way for them to verify the auth-
enticity of the stamp unless they have access to the county that certified
it and can compare stamps.  Rubber stamps can be purchased from any small print
shop with the words 'Certified' or 'County Clerk' embossed on them, then you
simply stamp the document and wala, it's legal!
  If someone wants to take this a step further in security, he can physically
go to the court house and pay to have a document certified... This usually costs
around five dollars, and they simply stamp the document.  This will give you
a copy of the real state seal to work from.  Then it is possible to make a
stamp or embosser to match it, although this is an extreme measure and really
is probably unnecessary.
  Origional birth certificates or blank birth certificates can be purchased
from a number of source around the country (refer to the above listing of
companies).  One GREAT note is that purchasing or selling blank birth cert's
IS COMPLETELY LEGAL!  It is not a government document but simply a piece of
paper that could concievably be used by a hospital or doctor for it's intended
purpose.  If the identity is not used to defraud anyone, especially the govern-
ment, the simple use of another name is not illegal.  Many people in their
professional lives including writers, actors, hackers, real estate agents, etc
legally create and use these aka's or pen names without any attempt at govern-
mental permission.
  The old method of finding some child that is the given age, and that died
is no longer valid or safe.  The government knows this scam all too well, and
you will get burned if you attempt it.  They now cross-reference over 60% of
the birth/death certificates, to almost stamp this ouw... Plus the also reference
the use of a birth certificate, so if you are using Joe Doe, and so is someone
else, and you both apply for a passport... It will be more than a postman who
delivers it to you!


PASSPORTS: HELL ON EARTH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Passports are probably the most secure for of ID you'll run across, and thank
God we don't need to forge them that often.  They are almost impossible to copy
without some of the best technology around, and if you are thinking of appling
for one off of a fake identitiy, forget it.  They check far to closely and far
too hard for even most of the best to withstant.  As far as I'm concerned I just
chalk that up as a loss...
  There is, however, a costly but very complete answer to this problem...  Costa
Rica (one of the last great grey-countries) will issue you a valid passport
if you by $10,000 in land, and pay taxes on an income of $500 a month to the
Costa Rica government (CR is a marvelous country that has no wars, no army, and
a poor but democratic society).  To apply for the passport, contact a Costa
Rican attorney or write to:
                            Lel Punto Costarricense S. A
                            Post Box 90
                            Paseo Estudintes
                            Costa Rica

Now one of the REAL side benifits to this is if you happen to get busted, you
will simply be extradited back to Costa Rica, only to be set free!
  There is also a company (for a much more reasonable fee) called the
International Documentation Commision, located at:
                            1012 - 14th St NW
                            Suite 1101
                            Washington, DC 22005

For $35 they issue a 42-page passport valid for three years, and for $60 a
passport valid for seven years.  They have issued over 2500 such passports, and
their passports are accepted in a case-by-case method in over 110 countries.
These countries are not North America or Europe, but mainly third world nations
(which always seem to border on the country you want to go to!).


SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I will not spend all together too much time on these, you can however find
out some great information on the structure of SSN's in my file Carding My Way
part 3.  For the most part these can be easily attained and/or forged since
they are just a piece of paper, with no hidden lines or stamps, they are just
a number.  And the beauty of the matter is the only one who knows what number
is who's is the government, so this means the only way you could get fucked by
using a fake one is either at a job, or at a bank come the first of the year
when they send in all the client information.  What this means is if you tell
TRW that Joe Doe is 555-11-2222, then that IS what Joe Doe's number is to the
rest of the world.  Business's, Hospitals, etc have no way of checking the
validity of what you are saying, only by the paper you show them...


DRIVERS LICENSE FORGERY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In most cases you really don't want to forge a drivers license, what you want
to do is forge all the infomation you give them, then apply for a real one...
This way you will get one that will pass even the closest scruteny (of course,
it's real).  Several methods are described below...
  One way is to take those temporary paper DL's they assign you when you are
waiting to recieve your real one, and use a laser printer to forge a fake one
with the stat's you want.  Then take this fake one down and ask what is taking
so long with your ID being send... Well, needless to say they won't be able to
find your file, and will re-take your photo, soon you'll be recieving a wonderful
new life...
  One of the more riskier methods is to forge another states ID, and then use
it to apply for an ID in the state you dwell in... Most of the time they will
accept this without any other forms of ID, and then you're ready to go!
  Another way which is along the same lines as the above methods is to use an
out-of-state temp license to get a temp. extention in the state you're in.  This
will be the same as the state you're in, so you then go to the next city and
turn it in for a real one!
  It's always a good idea to call ahead and find out what the DMV required in
order to get an ID... The requirements vary greatly from state to state, and if
you apply in a more rural city you will find them more willing to bend the rules
for you.  Some good proof of identity (that is easy to forge) is the following:

  School ID       Marriage Cert.      Insurance Papers    Bills w/ name on them
  Employment ID   School Transcipts   US Passport         Business Cards

I should also point out that you are probably going to have to take the drivers
test, so it would be a good idea to study that little book and make sure you
have access to a car on the big day...


DRIVER'S LICENSE COMPACT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  There is something called the Interstate Driver's License Compact to which
a little over half the 50 states belong to.  This agency handles convictions
of traffic voilations primarily to assuage the insurance companies out-of-state
convictions can get on the drivers license, upping his insurance rate.  States
which belong to thie compact agree to confiscate any out-of-state license upon
issuance of the license in a new state.  It should be noted that most states
do not return the licenses to the issueing state, they just destroy them.  No
cross-referencing as to the document itself occurs.  What this means to you is
that if you move from state A, to state B, make a forged copy of A's DL, submit
it to B and get B's, they will confiscate a fake and you will be the proud owner
of two real state ID's, each with INDEPENDANT records!  The only state I can
think of off hand that doesn't suscribe to the compact is California.


OTHER FILES COMING SOON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  I'm probably going to slow down for a bit, since I have some work that needs
to be taken care of, so be expecting releases like the ones below, and then
about one or so every month or so from there on... Each new release will have
a listing of files to be watching for.  Check out the Book of Fraud when I
finally release it... It will tie together EVERYTHING I've talked about, from
sabotage to carding to identity hoping, and how to use it to benifit you.  I'll
also teach you the special Video Vindicator method of fraud-finding, sure to
help you find that next super-scam.
