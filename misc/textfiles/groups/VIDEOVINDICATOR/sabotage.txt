  So, you want to fuck over some cars eh?  Well, you're reading the right file
then!  Most of the stuff in here was found out by either me or Phelix the
Hack, but some of them are from other files, which weren't based only on cars.
This is broken down into three sections, Major Damage, Medium Damage, and
Minor Damage.  Well... Let's Begin!


MAJOR DAMAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  So the guys really fucked you over, so you want to fuck him over in return,
here's a few things to do...
 
  o Take a normal prescription medicine bottle (those plastic brownish-clear
    ones) and fill it with Liquid Draino.  Pop it into the Gas tank and walk
    away.  The Liquid Draino will eat away the bottle and have a chemical 
    reaction with the gas... BOOM! 


MEDIUM DAMAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
  You don't want to destroy the car, but you want to fuck it over... Read on!

  o Take some Balony or Freeto's (the choice is yours, although Balony works
    best) and put it all over the hood and roof of the car.  Then dump 7-up
    all over the stuff.  It will then become chemically bonded to the paint
    and has to be scraped off.
  o Take a piece of tin foil (or even a gum wrapper!) and stick it in between
    the ligher and the filament, creating a junction.  Then, whether or not the
    car is on, the ligher will drain power, and wala!  The car's battery will
    'mysteriously' go dead!  Now... Most of the time the person will not even
    find the piece of whatever, let alone take it out, and then the fun stuff
    starts happening... The cars battery keeps dieing ever 2 days or so!  Until
    the guy either takes the car to the mechanic and has the problem tracked 
    down, or he finds it himself.
  o Take some fresh cat-shit, and put it on the hood/roof of the car (making
    sure it's a nice, warm, sunny day) and the acids in the cat shit will eat
    through the metal!  Then Splat!  The person opens the door to the wonderful
    smell of catshit all OVER the interior!  
  o Take a ping-pong ball, and drop it in the gas tank.  Then, after they drive
    about 5 or 10 miles, the ball clogs up the intake valve and blub-blub-blub
    the car sputters, as if out of gas.  Then, after the guy floods the engine
    the car will start up, go another few miles, and then stop again. 
  o Take about 12-15 Moth balls, and put them in the gas tank.  This will 
    increase the octain level of the gas and make it almost impossible to shut
    off the engine once it's started!!
  o Take some vasellein, and cover the car with it.  Then, fill the vasellein
    with metal shaving.  The vasellein will not come off no matter how hot the
    water is, they have to scrub it off... and then the metal shavings take
    effect, scatching off the paint.
  o Take a shotgun shell, and put it (facing out) in the muffler.  When it
    gets hot enough, it will ignite the shell and blow off the end of the 
    muffler!


MINOR DAMAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  So you want to take the wimpy way out and just annoy the guy?  Well... heres
a few suggestions.

  o Take some dirty grease and cover the muffler with it.  When the muffler
    get's hot enough, it will start pouring out black, thick smoke!
  o Take a small steel ball, and place it inside the tire (by removing the
    part which stops the air).  When the car drives along, it sounds like a
    hammer being hit against stell!


CONCLUSION
~~~~~~~~~~
 
  I'm not going to say "I take no responsibility for how this file is used"
because that's bullshit and we all know it.  Frankly, I couldn't care less if
you blew up the presidents limo with some info from this! 
  If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, feel free to contact
me at Shadows of IGA (my board).  You will get a response, as to whether or
not it's the one you wanted... I don't know.
  Greetings go to: Razor Ratte, GTI, Phelix the Hack, Gord the Rogue, Creative
Chaos, Peter Gunn, The Sparrow, and anyone else I know!
  Spread this file far and wide, but please do not modify it in any way.
