WHAT IS CELLULAR MANAGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Well, Cellular Manager (CM), would best be described as a kind of reference
program, much like Professor Falkins Phreakers Tools, except for Cellular phones
and the like.  CM has some of the most common tools in a easy, fast, menu driven
environment, to give us just one more edge over our opponents.
  I am not, however, going to go into any great detail about what each of the
options is for, and what can be done with the information gathered, since there
are many other nice files already out there that do just that (I would recommend
Bootlegger's freecell file from HohoCon, since in includes virtually all of the
information that is available at the moment).
  The most benifical part about this program is the fact that you can track down
the strongest control cell in your area.  This is especially useful when trying
to recieve the reverse control channel, which is very weak (due to power limit-
ations from the mobile to the base).


AVAILABLE OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  All of the options listed below are available from the main menu of the CM,
which the program defaults into.  Some options are also available from the
command line, which is discussed later.

  Create MIN1 and MIN2
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Generates the MIN1 and MIN2 for the phones NAM.  Prompts for the areacode
    and phone number, then outputs the MIN's in binary format.

  Cellular Channel to Frequency
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Fairly self-explanitory, converts a given cellular frequency into it's
    channel number.  Will display either forward, or reverse frequencies.

  Cellular Frequency to Channel
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Like above option, except reversed.

  Table of control Channels
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    A complete listing of all the controls numbers, their channel number, and
    forward and reverse frequencies.

  Convert HEX to Binary
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Convienient routine to convert a HEX number (up to 10 digits) into Binary

  Search list of Manufactures ESN by Name
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Searches through a list of Cellular phone manufactures name fields, then
    shows the most likely match and their decimal ESN identification

  Search list of Manufactures ESN by Identification
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Like above option, except reversed.

  Locate and list adjacent Cells
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Prompts for entry of the most powerful control or voice channel in your
    area, then displays a small hex table showing the closest cells and their
    identification.  This function also displays the cell's group status as well
    as it's designator.

  Search through Phone programming specs
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Searches through a list of Cellular phones available, and displays what
    information is available about reprogramming.  Well display all possible
    matches.

  Search through Directory of Wirelines
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Searches through a list of major cities in the US and then displays the
    Wire/Non-Wire (Band A&B) channels for each city.  States can also be
    specified.

  Cross-Reference Cell Groups
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    Uses the cellulars group identification and wireline specs to list all of
    the voice channels and their corresponding frequencies.  Also displays the
    control channel for the group, and it's forward frequency.

  Find Strongest Control Cell
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    This option requires you to have established 5 (no more, no less) control
    channels that can be received at your location.  After inputing their
    channel numbers, the program will respond with the group that is most likely
    to be the strongest.


THE BEST WAY TO SCAN REVERSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  The way I would recommend that will yield the best results when scanning the
reverse channels is this:

    (1) Locate and write down the forward control frequencies that you can hear
        with the antenni removed from your scanner.  Get at least five, and if
        possible stay either wireline or non-wireline.  Use the table in option
        [4] if necessary.
    (2) Convert the frequencies to their appropriate channel using option [3].
    (3) Enter the channels into option [C] and then write down the group.
    (4) Use option [B] to find the channel/frequencies, as well as the strongest
        voice channels in your region.
    (5) Enter the channel into option [2] and specify [R]everse information.

Simple enough, eh?  Now you have the best possible chance of capturing reverse
channel information (such as the ESN).  Also try to place your scanners antenni
in the most open location possible, although this is not necessary.  I have used
a Radio Shack Pro-37 (portable) with a DDI, and a laptop with very good success.


A COUPLE OF BRIEF NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  In the Locate & List Adj Cells function, on the hex chart that is displayed,
only cells that actually TOUCH the highlighed cell are adjacent to it.  The cells
on the left and right do not touch the primary cell, although they may appear to.
This is because there are redundant cells exactly opposite it in the field, and
I chose not to display those.
  When trying to establish what is most likely your strongest control channel,
it does not matter if you list Wireline and Non-Wireline channels.  This is due
to the fact that most cellular companies share a zone, and split it up on the
A/B settings appropriately.  Also, do not list the same cell channel twice, since
this will effect what it suggests.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Several of the main menu options are also available from the command line.
For a current listing of supported commands, at dos enter either 'CM /?' or
'CM /H'.  Operation through the command line is exactly the same as if the
option was selected from the menu.



KNOWN BUGS
~~~~~~~~~~
  None.


UPDATES
~~~~~~~
  I plan to keep CM as updated as possible, but this can only be done with your
help!  When you find any information that it does not contain, please leave it
to me on any of the systems listed below.  An open exchange of information helps
everyone, and this is the next frontier of phreaking...


PROGRAMS FOR THE FUTURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Here's some of the programs to be watching for, from me, in the future:

        ACTCHK        Checks CBI accounts against their algorhythm and verifies
                      format validity and extra information.
                        [AVAILABLE EARLY 1993]
        CBIDBS        A database that sorts and displays all of your credit
                      reports.  Implements the VC routines real time for
                      maximum security.  Allows searching for any field, comment
                      fields, and ARDT directory.
                        [AVAILABLE SUMMER 1993]
        VINHP         A new operating system for the HP 95/LX
                        [AVAILABLE FALL 1993]

A couple of notes on the systems listed below... There finally is a transfer
area on Demon Roach for my files (Log 38), so you can EASILY find them for a
change.  Unphamiliar Territory is now another cDc board, helping to spreading
the word of the holy bovine to the world.
  Here's a couple of things to keep in mind; Clinton's daughter is what happens
when you marry a relative (Jesus, what the fuck IS she?).  And, of course,
always remember...

        Fuck Clinton, Fuck Gore, Fuck Law & Order, and FUCK THE WORLD!
