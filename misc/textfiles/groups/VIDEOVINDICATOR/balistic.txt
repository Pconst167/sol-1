INTRODUCTION:

  I'm sure all of you are familiar with the Bic lighter, and I'm also sure
you've tried to make the Bic Flamethrower at one time or another.  Well...
here's 2 more things you can do, First off is the Bic Rocket, and then the
Bic Sparkler.  Both work almost every time!  Enjoy...

MATERIALS NEEDED:

        2 or more Bic lighters (the big kind)
        1 large open parkinglot with noncombustible material surrounding it

                \__/ 
                 .
        Flint--> I 
                 #
       Spring--> #

PREPARATION:

  First, hit the back side of the flame blocker against something and break
it off.  Take off the striker and get the spring and flint.  Set them aside
somewhere safe for later use.  Next pull off the Fuel Valve, and put your
fingure over the hole where the fuel comes out and shake it up.  Leave your
fingure on the hole.

LAUNCHING:

  Find someplace where you can lay the lighter so the bottom faces up.  Set it
there, take the other lighter and light the rocket.  It should burn just like
it normally does, except the flame should be melting the plastic.  It melts
down to the fuel and... one of three things happens: It flies up into the air
and explodes (usually about 10-20 feet up), Skips along the ground, or just
explodes.  It usually takes about 2 minutes for it to burn through the plastic.
What every you do, don't go back to the lighter after it's been burning for
more than 1 minute.  And only go back if the flame went out!

BIC SPARKLER:

  This isn't really a sparkler, but it sure is fun.  Take the flint and the
spring you set aside from the rocket and wrap the flint in the spring, like
this, you pull the sprint, put the flint in the middle, like a plus sign, and
then twist the spring once so it looks like this:

                           Flint
                                \
                                 ||
                               ."||". <- Spring
                              ."    ".
                              "      "
Then hold it over the flame of the one lighter you have left until it starts
to wrinkle up or get red.  Then throw it against a wall and whoosh, sparks fly
everywhere and there's a little char mark left on the wall. 

CONCLUSION:

Enjoy these, they're lots of fun at parties when everyones drunk, the sparkler
is really trippy then.  They are both best at night, but good during the day
as well.  If you have any comments about this file, or suggestions for other
files, leave me Feedback on my board (Shadows of Iga).
