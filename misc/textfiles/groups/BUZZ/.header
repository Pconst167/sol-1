<H1>Groups: The Buzz Brothers</H1>
<P>
The Buzz Brothers seem to be predominantly occupied with the legalization
of drugs, and cite many articles, statistics, and general essays on why
this is a good idea. They're literate, they're clear, and they're easy
to read. For some reason, they go into some other subjects, such as
area code lists and lists of dirty words, but their hearts are sort
of in the right place.
