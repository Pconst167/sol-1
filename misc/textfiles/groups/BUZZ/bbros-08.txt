Comment:

OZ --->  Goat
Ma --->  Man - n
n  --->  A represents the pentagram.  n being a pentagram, incomplete/corrupt.
         Pentagram --> 4 elements and spirit triumphant over them.  The opp
                       when inverted, the head of the goat. 
\/ \/ \/ \/ \/
Goat-Man or how the goat may become as a man, as Christ/Buddha/etc...

Goat ---> triumph of the elements over spiritual essence
Man  ---> Potential of man to triumph over the elements (i.e. enter the state
of being called "Christ", the archetypal pentagram, conquering of 'n')
\/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/

"Oz" THEN "Ma" --->  Triumph through application of the command of the
Delphic Oracle, "Know Thyself" or as To Mega Therion put it, "Do What Thou
Wilt!"  Note the 'n' is gone.  Spirit has triumphed over the elements.
