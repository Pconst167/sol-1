                Note
               ------

   During the nearly twenty years since the "Seven Words You Can Never Say On
Television" first appeared on the Class Clown album, and especially since the
time (1982) when the idea was expanded to include impolite expressions of all
types, TV-banned or otherwise, hundreds of people have sent me suggestions on
words and phrases which they thought ought to be included on the list.  Some
sent single items, while others submitted long lists they had obviously taken
some trouble to compile.  I wish now I had kept a record of their names.  Not
knowing I would one day attempt this project, my practice at the time was to add
the submitted entries to my "filth" folder, send the person a few autographed
items (albums, pictures, videos, shirts) in appreciation, and discard the
original letters.  I wish I had handled it differently so that I could give them
credit here.  But, of course, the real credit belongs to the thousands of people
over the centuries who invented these phrases in the first place, folk poets,
all.  To those who sent me their suggestions, you know who you are, and I thank
you from the bottom of my farting clapper.
