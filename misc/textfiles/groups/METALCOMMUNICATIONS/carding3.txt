\+/ Good Ole' Carbon\+/
/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\

    I remember the days when they used to not even think twice about there
carbons, and the simple carder with very little knowledge could just walk up and
take them out of just about any ole' garbage can that they may find, but since
then they have gotten smarter.

    1] I quick and dirty little scam.  Here is one I have allways been fond of,
       as with many scams, this requires a little initial cash for the setting
       up of it.  Here are your more nessessary tools needed...
          A] A Post Office Box....under your fake company name of course.
          B] I Computer/Printer for best results, or you can use a
             typewriter.
          C] Stamps/Envelopes/LetterHead

           You would be surprised at the stupidity of the average person.  This
       is a perfect example of a proven perfect scam operation.  First off,
       think of a product that you think that people would want to buy, that
       doesn't cost very much, that isn't really available in stores, not that
       you actually have to have the product, just as long as you know enough
       about it to write a little letter on it.  Then, simply go through the
       phone book in another town somewhere and pick out names/addresses.

    2] CBI/TRW.  Many people have come to me asking about using these systems,
       what I say is, "Do you want to get caught?", if they say no, of course,
       I say then don't use them!  This is to be left to proffesional's, not
       to amatuer's at carding,

    3] More Postal Theft.  As I have mentioned in Carding II, stealing them
       out of mailboxes is the best way I can think of, that still holds true,
       just take a rather nice drive and pick a few up.  This way you can just
       cruise out to another town.

    4] Simple Art of Bullshit.  There are MANY MANY absolutely stupid people
       in the world(like the assholes Dad I called and told that his son was
       arrested for rape...hehehe!), that will believe anything if you sound
       proffesional.

    5] The Ole' Look over the shoulder.  If you just sit in a line and watch
       long enough, you can pick up enough info on someone just looking over
       there shoulder if you have a good memory.  Such as, say they are buying
       something at a store, and you watch over their shoulder and then write
       down the card number.

    6] If All Else Fails.  If all else fails, get a gun, wait outside a store
       and pull it on them and say give me your fucking credit card or i'll
       blow your damn head off you jewish nigger motherfucker!  Take there
       credit card and kill them, or tie them up.

\+/ Getting that ole' Misc. \+/
/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\

    A commonly asked question to me is "How do I find out ... on someone if they
ask it when I call up".  Here is a little aid for you guys.

    1] Address.  Address is the easiest, just call up the Directory Assistance
       for the city that the carbon was obtained in(odds are they live in the
       city that you got the card from).  Pretty simple eh?

    2] Bank who issued the card.  Whoa, a tuffy if you just have the carbon
       isn't it!  The Bank is represented by the first 4 digits on the card.
       When I have time I am going to compile a list of all the big banks 4
       digit code.

    3] Social Security Number.  Listed in TRW accounts, not sure, but I think
       CBI too.  Though the best is the B.S. Way(see below).

    4] Drivers Licence.  Damn!  Usually a stumper for me, though they rarely ask
       for it.  Only real way is the B.S. Way(see below).

    The 'B.S.' Way.  I am sure that you can figure it out allready what I am
talking about.  Bullshit is an art, that needs be perfected, so if you can't lie
your ass off like i can, and have a reasonablely adult sounding voice (Too Bad
'The Watcher'!).

    Ring Ring Click "Hello?".
    Yes, this is the Department of Moter Vehicles in <insert the area where they
live>, is this Mr. Joe Blow(or whatever), we had a computer system crash, and
have lost partial data on you.  Could you please read us your Drivers License
number and Social Insurance Number.

     80% of the time they won't even give it a second thought and give it to you
right then and there, not thinking of the consiquences of there actions.

\+/ Most Common ways to get caught carding/+\
/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/

    Everyone who has gotten caught has allways said that how it wasn't there
fault and all that shit, that is allmost never true, for, many people will
disagree with me, but, excellent carders never get caught, because they think it
out.

    Here are some of the more common ways of getting caught...

    1] Using a card taken off of a BBS!  This is #1 in the fool department!
       Because by the time it got to you it was probably used allready for
       something and Mr. Visa will be there to revoke you when you go to pick
       your item up!

    2] Telling people!  I know all you K-Neat0 people like to brag about
       carding stuff, I see it all the time!  Well, that is one of the worst
       things to do, because, even if you tell someone you think you can trust,
       odds are he is going to tell someone is pretty high.

    3] Keeping the stuff you card!  If it is something that is easily tracable
       (such as a guitar) then don't keep it!  Sell it!  Get rid of it somehow!
       You don't want anything in your house that can be traced back to a
       carding thing.

    4] Selling it!  Sounds kinda contridictory eh?  Not really, when selling
       something you carded, only the fool would sell it in the same state as
       they carded it from, because with your bad luck, the owner of the company
       will notice.

    Those may seem like pretty stupid mistakes but many people make them!

    I know you people who have gotten caught are going to say fuck you, but I
can say for a fact that if you got caught, you definately fucked up somewhere!

     I am not going to say anything more about Carding Airline Tickets, because
I told you guys too much about it in the first file, I don't want the stupid
assholes ruining my fun with Airline Tickets like they ruined Carding by fucking
up so much at it!

\+/ Carding Files...\+/
/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\+/+\

     I don't want a bunch of calls coming in as usual asking me to card things
for people, for my first law is...if you write a file on something you damn
better well never do it again unless you want to get busted.
     Now I don't want to see what I saw with the first two files, a bunch of
losers coming just changing my wording around and making there own file!  If I
made any suggestions that were described in anyone elses Carding File then
sorry.
