<H1>Groups: Neon Knights / Metal Communications</H1>
<P>
Based around New Jersey but quickly spreading nationwide, Metal Communications
was one of the odder blends of Textfile Writing Geeks and Metalheads. Heavy
Metal music comprises a major theme in the textfiles, as well as a very strong
bent of generally messing up the planet with a crowbar, one mailbox at a time.
Metal Communications lasted about three years, from 1983 to 1986.
<P>
The influence of Metal Communications (both the strong influx of anarchy
files and a general satanic bent) is evident in a lot of freelance anarchy
files and the work of such groups as the Cult of the Dead Cow, who had members
in Metal Communications before cDc really became a strong voice of its own.
<P>
A smaller group of members of Metal Communications started calling themselves
The Neon Knights, which included the leaders of Metal Communications and a
few chosen minions. Their files tended to be of a higher quality than the
rest, or at least longer. Generally, the Neon Knights also ran the Metal
Communications distribution BBSs and AE lines.
