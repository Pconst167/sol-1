That is a very piss poor drawing if you didn't notice. There is a carb on the
other side to get the very best draw/hit you feel optimum for you.

Hooka was the infamous semi-portable red U.S. Bong that served aproximately
a good 75 people or more in its heyday. A lot of people owe many hours of good
times to this Bong.

Finally, this long saga had to come to an end. One day we were in the 79' Red
Chevy IMPALA driving and enjoying the scenery. And what do you know, Mr. Police
Man saw us in the not so hot looking IMPALA (The IMPALA Story to come later).
Mr. Police Man had a very good sense of ameallion, no I mean smell. He said
"Everybody out of the car please." We said "Siiure Mr. Police Man" Forgetting
that Hooka was no so safely under the front side passenger seat. Mr. Police Man
found Hooka, but not the Bowl. Boy were we ever scared. But good old BOB had
packed another bowl and forgot to put it into Hooka. So Mr. Police Man said
"Well boys, since there is no bowl to this WATER PIPE, I really can't get you
on anything. But I'm gonna take this WATER PIPE none the less. The expressions
on our faces turned to immediate saddness. It was like a part of our lives was
just taken away forever. Mr. Police Man saw our expression, but just snickered
and drove away. We got the trusty rolling papers out and rolled a nice fat one,
and proceeded to smoke our sorrows away.

To this day none of us have seen Hooka since that fateful day. Now everyone is
in college, or working somewhere, and Hooka is just a faded memory. But I know
and they all know that Hooka will live on for eternity in everyone who smoked
out of her.



                          God Bless Hooka.
