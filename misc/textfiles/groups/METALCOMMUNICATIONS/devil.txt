The Devil Files are a series of files written by The Blade on the topic of
hell, Satan, death, and destruction.  Though The Blade seems like a sincere
Devil worshiper, he is not.  He is just interested in hell, Satan, death, 
destruction, and morbid things in general.  These series of files are not
intended to offend anyone, that is if they do.  Read with an open mind, 
because someday, it might happen.

As I come to the very gates of hell, I see the fire warming my enlightened
face.  The place where I belong, with my friends.  I walk up to satan and
I say, what be this, and what be that, and he says, "your gonna like it here"
i was saying to myself that this sounded like a 'goto bermuda'
commerical, but he heard my thoughts, and grinned.  He said if I was hungry
there's family masses, just toss the corn into the stove....  Then I
exploded into sheer joy at the very thought of having burning flesh for
dinner every night....  He gave me a box of Marlboro's, bless his burnt
soul, I lit up, to my suprise, my hand was on fire, no need for a lighter any
more, and I just tossed it into the seering stove that surroneded me.  As
I was smokin my butt, my friends started to waltz in.  Overjoyed at
their presents, I immedadity shook thier flamming hands, and still no
pain had overcome me, it was like heaven.  I asked Lucifier why this
was, and he replied, 'you have been on the devils side for quite along time,
worshiping the devils music' i thought to myself, hell, Metal got me to this
great place...

Hell was really Heaven after all, just do what you want in your life, then a
constaint good time in Hell will come to you.

As I stand inside the very gates of hell, I realize now that I am the
keeper of the gates.  I decide who and who not to let in the great land
of Upper Hell.  I take a break, go down to the firey pits to laugh at
the stupid soles who sined only a few times.  They look up at me in great
despair, they are constantly burning, burning, not a moment of hope will
come to them, unless I get them out.  I see a young woman, the shadow of
a lucious body I see between the flames.  I reach my infinate arm down
to grasp her from the boiling depths, as she clings to my arm like a poor
beggar clings to his money.  She looks at me with a story in her eye that
says she will be my servant for all time.  But there are no servants I say
to her, and she knows that I know everything about everyone.  I start
walking away from the pits.  She starts to follow.  I yell 'who said to
follow??' and I extend my great firey arm and throw her back to the pits of
eteranal flame.  No one does until they are asked.  Then I light up my
never ending pack of Marby's and return to the gates, reminasing about
the moment of fun that I just had.

As I choose who shall go in to these very gates of hell, I ammuse myself by
bringing false hopes to the sinners that have recently deceased.  They
walk up to the firey pits, because they have no choice.  I look at their
past life, and see who has belived in the allmighty "GOD", and who has'nt.
I see women who have whorshipd god through out their lifetime, these
people have been good, but have SINNED too many times for "GODS" liking. 
These women make me sick, so I make them burn, burn, burn in fire!  Thou
shalt not sin, BULLSHIT! why would anybody not want to have a job like
mine.  There has been a rumor around that Satan was going to send me down
to be the next ANTI-CHRIST, of course I would jump to the occasion.  Going
up to earth, and having great mass GENOCIDE cover the earth, the thought
of it is exciting, and devistating for those who are in its path.  So as I
chose those who shall go to upper or lower hell, I get taken away suddenly,
by lucifer's great power, and he speaks......

As Lucifer grants me the great privledge of becoming the next
Anti-Christ, he sends me down to a strange american town.  As I walk
along the silent street, No one notices me any diffrently than anyone
else.  I have an unlimited money suppily, any wish I have becomes
reality.  I obtain a residence to start the second coming of myself, the
Anti-Christ.  My name is Joeseph Lyocide.  This small town soon weakens
under my presents, but they do not know what death, destruction, and
despair they and I will bring to this earth.  I start a discuised club, the
name of this club is The Knights of Manson.  I lure them into my trap then
put my spell over their virgin soles.  I teach them to rape, pillage,
destroy, and convert innocent people into Genocidal maniacs.  Soon, the
whole state, and surronding states of Nebraska have fallen under my spell,
no one can stop me, millions are making other millions of people
convert to The Knigts of Manson.  (The K of M).  Soon 10's of millions
are dead, and the ones that live are K of M's.  Nothing can stop me...

Not even you.

As I devistate the central United States, I become God, or Satan to my
followers.  The Knights Of Manson cannot be defeated, now over 13
million are dead, and 63 million are members.  I am their leader, they do
what I say, if they don't, death will come to every member of their family.
As I obtain Minneapolis, St. Paul, Chicago, Kansas City, and Many other
major central Ammerican cities, we now are an army.  The United States
government must surrender to my terms, or millions more will die.  I must
have compleate control over the armed forces, and make all decisions.  They
must agree, if they don't they will simply die.  By now, i have control of
the west coast too.  Now the east coast is in my sights, but I see
myself with the greed, so I slow.  I get a secure grip on the people's
brainwashed minds, so they are ALL on my side, if they are not, death is
their twisted fate.  Time and strength is on my side, the weak government
must surrender to me, or GENOCIDE will strike the land, and my goal will be
accomplished.  I sit in my plush headquaters and wait......

the time WILL COME.

            
The Knights of Manson still are waiting for the governments decision,
look for the file DEVIL6 coming to an ae or bbs near you.
