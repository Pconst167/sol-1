"In My Grip"
 ----------

Hot Night
Break Neck
Oozing into that thing

It seethes
It foams
It splits the death of love

All the things you hold most dear
Gone
And the world, it dies
In my grip
All the world
And everything
In my grip

Hold tight
It comes
Entry level
Smooth and quick
To claim its wants
It need only put out its hand

Your mate
Your life
Everything you are and could be

It owns
It covets
It splits the death of hope

All the thing you hold most dear
Gone


"Mother of Mercy"
 ---------------

Mother of Mercy
Let me crawl on your bathroom floor
Let my will ebb into your house
I haven't done this for such a long time
We all want our time in hell
We all want our time in hell
Mother of Mercy
I've been told not to stand erect
Will you take me into your womb
Can you soothe me for just a day
We all want our time in hell
We all want our time in hell
Slide with me to your nether world
Motion exquisite
In sweet demise


"Kiss of Steel"
 -------------

Car crash
The pressing of two lips
Hard steel
And an accidental death
One action does you up
Kiss of steel
Press your face to the metal
Crash
Fell your nose and cheeck bones
Crack
What action does you up
Kiss of steel
We're having a love affair
With a Chevy in midair
Kiss of steel
Let the mouth taste the silver spread
Let it ride and the rubber screech
One shot will do them up
Kiss of steel


"Let the Day Begin"
 -----------------

Let the day begin
Let the horror start
Let the fury swell - let the skies all cry
Let the day begin
Let the fun begin
Let the worlds collide
Let the day begin - let humanity spin
Let the day begin
Inherent time is at hand
So then let the day begin
Nomadic walls into light
So then let the day begin
Let the world stand bare
Let it stand on trial
Let it open up - let the tides explode
Let the day begin
Let the Jews all scream
Let the Catholics burn
Let the Protestants hide
Let the false ones hallow in their own demise
Let the fun begin
Let the worlds collide
Let the day begin - Let humanity spin
Let the day begin
And the earth stands stripped
And its imminent rape
Let them get their due
Let them fell the pain
That they gave to you


"Birthright"
 ----------

This is your legacy
You are born to it
It will ever be
It will be on your heels
It will share your bed
Let it comfort thee
Inching in and out till' prime
You are born to it
It will take you whole
Just let it guide you fierce
You are mad to birth
Till' the end of time


"To Walk the Night"
 ------------------

To walk the night
To feel no love
To know the touch of another kiss
Nevermore
To walk the night
To forever roam
To escape inside cold darkness
Alone
I have wandered
My whole life long
The night becomes my bride
And everything else must die
World without end
For me
Unearthly night
World you fear
Love lies lurking
A wounded dingo dog
Soon to decease
To walk the night
Solitary friend
Night ethereal
World without end
Forevermore
Forever


"November's Fire"
 ---------------

Night calls on summer's end
Dark aspect
The breed divine
Knee deep
The blood of a swine
Come season
Come reborn
Arms to flail and flame
Waving
Trembling
All things must breed to flame
All things must come to ash
November coming fire
Samhain grim
And it all comes down
Samhain grim
Embrace the night air
Summer's end
Heaven sent
Breeds the fires musk
Insatiating fall


"Unbridled"
 ---------

Unbridled
My horses
Run wild over your mind
Unbridled
My horses 
Run wild over time
A thing of beauty
Foes to trample fools
Unbridled
Relentless
Screaming from my ribs
Unbridled
Relentless
My will is picking it up
Unbridled
Never satisfied
My will to keep it up


"Human Pony Girl"
 ---------------

How do you like it so far
Giddyup
I am your power and your pain
I'll make you gallop at my pace
Human pony girl
I am the monkey on your back
And we're going for a ride
Human pony girl
Your nights are a season at my command
My pony girl
This is my highway
No limit in force
There is no law
Just
Feel my spur
Sink into your flank
Feel it
Feel it pony
Stomach sweats
In your spine
Belly up
Shoulders down
Gonna take you someplace you ain't never been
Thats right
Only you ain't never coming back
I am the monkey on your back
And I'm gonna ride you home
I am the monkey on your back
I'm gonna break you
I am your power and your pain
I'm gonna make you
