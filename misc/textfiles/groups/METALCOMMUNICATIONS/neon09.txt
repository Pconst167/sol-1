! WHAT HYPNOTISM IS !
+-------------------+

HYPNOTISM, CONTRARY TO COMMON BELEIF, IS MERELY STATE WHEN YOUR MIND AND BODY
ARE IN A STATE OF RELAXATION AND YOUR MIND IS OPEN TO POSITIVE, OR CLEVERLY
WORDED NEGATIVE, INFLUENCES. IT IS NOT A TRANCE WHERE YOU:

                                        O ARE TOTALLY INFLUENCABLE.
                                        O CANNOT LIE.
                                        O A SLEEP WHICH YOU CANNOT WAKE UP FROM
                                          WITHOUT HELP.

THIS MAY BRING DOWN YOUR HOPES SOMEWHAT, BUT, HYPNOTISM IS A POWERFUL FOR SELF
HELP, AND/OR MISCHEIF.

+-----------------------+
! YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND !
+-----------------------+

POWER IS YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND. THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT IS GOING
ON WITH EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY, EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY. IT PROTECTS YOU FROM
NEGATIVE INFLUENCES, AND RETAINS THE POWER TO SLOW YOUR HEARTBEAT DOWN AND STUFF
LIKE THAT. THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND HOLDS JUST ABOUT ALL THE INFO YOU WOULD LIKE TO
KNOW ABOUT YOURSELF, OR, IN THIS CASE, THE PERSON YOU WILL BE HYPNOTISING. THERE
ARE MANY WAYS TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS AND HAVE IT TALK BACK TO YOU. ONE WAY
IS THE OUJA BOARD, NO ITS NOT A SPIRIT, MERELY THE MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE USING
IT. ANOTHER, WHICH I WILL DISCUSS HERE, IS THE PENDULUM METHOD. OK, HERE IS HOW
IT GOES. FIRST, GET A RING OR A WASHER AND TIE IT TO A THREAD A LITTLE LONGER
THAN HALF OF YOUR FOREARM. NOW, TAKE A SHEET OF PAPER AND DRAW A BIG CIRCLE IN
IT. IN THE BIG CIRCLE YOU MUST NOW DRAW A CROSSHAIR (A BIG +). NOW, PUT THE
SHEET OF PAPER ON A TABLE. NEXT, HOLD THE THREAD WITH THE RING OR WASHER ON IT
AND PLACE IT (HOLDING THE THREAD SO THAT THE RING IS 1 INCH ABOVE THE PAPER
SWINGING) IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSHAIR. NOW, SWING THE THREAD SO THE WASHER
GOES UP AND DOWN, SAY TO"YOURSELF THE WORD "YES" NOW, DO IT SIDE TO SIDE AND SAY
THE WORD "NO". DO IT COUNTER CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DON'T KNOW". AND LASTLY, DO IT
CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DONT WANT TO SAY." NOW, WITH THE THREAD BACK IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CROSSHAIR, ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS AND WAIT FOR THE PENDULUM TO SWING IN
THE DIRECTION FOR THE ANSWER. (YES, NO, I DONT KNOW OR I DONT WANNA SAY...).
SOON, TO YOUR AMAZEMENT, IT WILL BE ANSWERING QUESTIONS LIKE ANYTHING... LET
THE PENDULUM ANSWER, DONT TRY ..  WHEN YOU TRY YOU WILL NEVER GET AN ANSWER. LET
THE ANSWER COME TO YOU.

+-------------------------+
! HOW TO INDUCE HYPNOTISM !
+-------------------------+

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND, I WILL NOW TELL YOU HOW
TO GUIDE SOMEONE INTO HYPNOSIS. NOTE THAT I SAID GUIDE, YOU CAN NEVER, HYNOTISE
SOMEONE, THEY MUST BE WILLING. OK,THE SUBJECT MUST BE LYING OR SITTING IN A
COMFORTABLE POSITION, RELAXED, AND AT A TIME WHEN THINGS ARENT GOING TO BE
INTERRUPTED. TELL THEM THE FOLLOWING, OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO IT, IN A PEACEFUL,
MONOTINOUS TONE (NOT A COMMANDING TONE OF VOICE)

NOTE:  LIGHT A CANDLE AND PLACE IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT CAN BE EASILY SEEN.

"TAKE A DEEP BREATH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND HOLD IT IN FOR THE COUNT OF 8. NOW,
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH, EXHALE COMPLETELY AND SLOWLY. CONTINUED BREATHING LONG,
DEEP, BREATHS THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH. TENSE UP ALL
YOUR MUSCLES VERY TIGHT, NOW, COUNTING FROM TEN TO ONE, RELEASE THEM SLOWLY, YOU
WILL FIND THEM VERY RELAXED. NOW, LOOK AT THE CANDLE, AS YOU LOOK AT IT, WITH
EVERY BREATH AND PASSING MOMEMENT, YOU ARE FEELING INCREASINGLY MORE AND MORE
PEACEFUL AND RELAXED. THE CANDLES FLAME IS PEACEFUL AND BRIGHT. AS YOU LOOK AT
IT I WILL COUNT FROM 100 DOWN, AS A COUNT, YOUR EYES WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE
RELAXED, GETTING MORE AND MORE TIRED WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT."

NOW, COUNT DOWN FROM 100, ABOUT EVERY 10 NUMBERS SAY "WHEN I REACH XX YOUR EYES
(OR YOU WILL FIND YOUR EYES) ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE TIRED." TELL THEM THEY
MAY CLOSE THEIR EYES WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT. IF THE PERSONS EYES ARE STILL
OPEN WHEN YOU GET TO 50 THEN INSTEAD OF SAYING "YOUR EYES WILL.." SAY  "YOUR
EYES ARE...". WHEN THEIR EYES ARE SHUT SAY THE FOLLOWING.

"....AS YOU LIE (OR SIT) HERE WITH YOUR EYES COMFORTABLY CLOSE YOU FIND YOUR
SELF RELAXING MORE AND MORE WITH EACH MOMENT AND BREATH. THE RELAXATION FEELS
PLEASANT AND BLISSFUL SO, YOU HAPPILY GIVE WAY TO THIS WONDERFUL FEELING."
" IMAGINE YOURSELF ON A CLOUD, RESTING PEACEFULLY, WITH A SLIGHT BREEZE CARESS
ING YOUR BODY. A TINGLING SENSASION BEGINS TO WORK ITS WAY, WITHIN AND WITHOUT
YOUR TOES, IT SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR FEET, MAKING THEM WARM, HEAVY AND RELAXED.
THE CLOUD IS SOFT AND SUPPORTS YOUR BODY WITH ITS SOFT TEXTURE, THE SCENE IS
PEACEFUL AND ABSORBING, THE PEACEFULNESS ABSORBS YOU COPLETELY... THE TINGLING
GENTLY AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR LEGS, RELAXING THEM. MAKING THEM WARM AND HEAVY.
THE RELAXATION FEELS VERY GOOD, IT FEELS SO GOOD TO RELAX AND LET GO. AS THE
TINGLING CONTINUES ITS JOURNEY UP INTO YOUR SOLAR PLEXUS, YOU FEEL YOUR INNER
STOMACH BECOME VERY RELAXED. NOW, IT MOVES SLOWLY INTO YOUR CHEST, MAKING YOUR
BREATHING RELAXED AS WELL. THE FEELING BEGINS TO MOVE UP YOUR ARMS TO YOUR
SHOULDERS, MAKING YOUR ARMS HEAVY AND RELAXED AS WELL. YOU ARE AWARE OF THE
TOTAL RELAXATION YOU ARE NOW EXPERIENCING, AND YOU GIVE WAY TO IT. IT IS GOOD
AND PEACEFUL, THE TINGLING NOW MOVEVES INTO YOUR FACE AND HEAD, RELAXING YOUR
JAWS, NECK, AND FACIAL MUSCLES, MAKING YOUR CARES AND WORRIES FLOAT AWAY. AWAY
INTO THE BLUE SKY AS YOU REST BLISFULLY ON THE CLOUD...."

IF THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE OR YOU THINK THEY (HE OR SHE..) IS GOING TO SLEEP,
THEN ADD IN A "...ALWAYS CONCENTRATING UPON MY VOICE, INGORING ALL OTHER SOUNDS.
EVEN THOUGH OTHER SOUNDS EXSIST, THEY AID YOU IN YOUR RELAXATION..." THEY SHOULD
SOON LET OUT A SIGH AS IF THEY WERE LETTING GO, AND THEIR FACE SHOULD HAVE A
"WOODENESS" TO IT, BECOMING FEATURLESS... NOW, SAY THE FOLLOWING

".... YOU NOW FIND YOURSELF IN A HALLWAY, THE HALLWAY IS PEACEFUL AND NICE. AS I
COUNT FROM 10 TO 1 YOU WILL IMAGINE YOURSELF WALKING FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN THE
HALL. WHEN I REACH ONE YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF WHERE YOU WANT TO BE, IN ANOTHER,
HIGHER STATE OF CONCIOUS AND MIND. (COUNT FROM TEN TO ONE)....."

DO THIS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES. THEN, TO TEST IF THE SUBJECT IS UNDER
HYPNOSIS OR NOT, SAY....

"...YOU FEEL A STRANGE SENSATION IN YOUR (ARM THEY WRITE WITH) ARM, THE FEELING
BEGINS AT YOUR FINGERS AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR ARM, AS IT MOVES THROUGH YOUR
ARM YOUR ARM BECOMES LIGHTER AND LIGHTER, IT WILL SOON BE SO LIGHT IT WILL RISE
.....  BECOMING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER WHICH EACH BREATH AND MOMENT..."

THEIR FINGERS SHOULD BEGIN TO TWITCH AND THEN MOVE UP, THE ARM FOLLOWING, NOW
MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE HIM/HER IN HYPNOSIS. THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THIS, WHILE
HE/SHE IS UNDER SAY GOOD THINGS, LIKE: "YOUR GOING TO FEEL GREAT TOMORROW" OR
"EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BECOMING BETTER AND BETTER".. OR
SOME CRAP LIKE THAT... THE MORE THEY GO UNDER, THE DEEPER IN HYPNOSIS THEY WILL
GET EACH TIME YOU DO IT.

+----------------------------+
! WHAT TO DO WHEN HYPNOTISED !
+----------------------------+

WHEN YOU HAVE THEM UNDER YOU MUST WORD THINGS VERY CAREFULLY TO GET YOUR WAY.
YOU CANNOT SIMPLY SAY... TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND HUMP THE PILLOW. NO, THAT
WOULD NOT REALLY DO THE TRICK. YOU MUST SAY SOMETHING LIKE.... "YOU FIND YOUR
SELF AT HOME, IN YOUR ROOM AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER (VIVIDLY DESCRIBE THEIR
ROOM AND WHATS HAPPENING), YOU BEGIN TO TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES..." NOW, IT CANT
BE THAT SIMPLE, YOU MUST KNOW THE PERSONS HOUSE, ROOM, AND SHOWER ROOM. THEN
DESCRIBE THINGS VIVIDLY AND TELL THEM TO ACT IT OUT (THEY HAVE TO BE DEEPLY
UNDER TO DO THIS...). I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT YOU EXPERIMENT A WHILE, AND GET
TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS.

+-----------+
! WAKING UP !
+-----------+

WAKING UP IS VERY EASY, JUST SAY..

"...AS I COUNT FROM 1 TO 5 YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BECOMMING MORE AND MORE
AWAKE, MORE AND MORE LIVELY. WHEN YOU WAKE UP YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF COMPLETELY
ALIVE, AWAKE, AND REFRESHED. MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, REMEMBERING THE PLEASANT
SENSATION THAT HYPNOSIS BRINGS... WAKING UP FEELING LIKE A NEW BORN BABY, REBORN
WITH LIFE AND VIGOR, FEELING EXCELLENT. REMEMBERING THAT NEXT TIME YOU ENTER
HYPNOSIS IT WILL BECOME AN EVER INCREASING DEEPER AND DEEPER STATE THAN BEFORE.
1- YOU FEEL ENERGY COURSE THROUGHOUT YOUR LIMBS. 2- YOU BEGIN TO BREATHE DEEPLY,
STIRRING. 3- BEGINING TO MOVE MORE AND MORE YOUR EYES OPEN, BRINGING YOU UP TO
FULL CONCIOUS. 4- YOU ARE UP,UP, UP AND AWAKENING MORE AND MORE. 5- YOU ARE
AWAKE AND FEELING GREAT."

AND THATS IT! YOU NOW KNOW HOW TO HYPNOTISE YOURSELF AND SOMEONE ELSE. YOU WILL
LEARN MORE AND MORE AS YOU EXPERIMENT.
