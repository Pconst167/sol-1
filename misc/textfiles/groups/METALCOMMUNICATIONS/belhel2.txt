  /CONTENTS/
In vol. I we discussed some of the minor aspects of bell hell. Now we shall 
enter the realm of serious bell hell, including how to crush AT&T's firm grip 
on the wired industry and Ma's underground passages.

  /MA'S CODES ETC./
 In order to make things easier for her employees, Ma has given us not only 
 free access to almost all her treasures but guides next to them to help us 
 along the way. One of the more common boxes found are the ones located either 
 at the end of your street, 

               Red  (ring-) = Ring line, allows others to call you
             Green  (tip+)  = Calling out line, for you to call others

 Ma has convienlently located these, the red on the right and the green on the 
 left. If you run into one of these boxes and it's locked then you'll need to 
 purchas either a 1/2" crowbar or an 7/16" hex driver, prefferably the latter. 
 In order to use the 7/
 The other, and less likely to be found of the bell underground network is just 
 that, and underground network. To find one of these simply look for a manhole 
 cover with an bell in the middle instead of an S or what-ever you sanitary 
 dept. might use. The as
  Now that your in one of these boxes theres a rather interesting list of 
  prospects you can do, connect a linesmans handset, connect a box, or 
  eavesdrop to name a few, here's some of the ways to do the following.

Hell #1:
   /LINESMANS HANDSET/
 In order to make a linesmans handset (if not included within the newly found 
 box) you'll need a few things:
               1} a phone (prefferably a GTE flip fone or a slimline)
               2} a spliceing knife (any knife will do, the sharper the better)
               3} a set of aligator clamps (if not already within the box)
 Now take your knife and cut off all the wires and the modular jack (if one) 
 saving the red(ring-) and green(tip+) wires. Now attach the aligator clips, 
 one to the red and one to the green, and your set. All you need do is attach 
 the aligator clips to the 

Hell #2:
   /THE BLACK/BLUE BOX/
  Finally a place where you can use that box of yours with minimal worries of 
  being caught (the only way would be to get caught red-handed). Ah yes, bell 
  hell at one of its finer points. Commonly it takes Ma about a month or so to 
  figure out the trip on th
  If you are unfamilar with boxes, the black box allows others to call you 
  free where-as the blue box allows you to use operator lines and even become 
  one with the bitches (become an operator). For more info I would suggest 
  consulting black/blue box plans.
   Use the normal plans for a black/blue box and make the following 
   modifications:
       Equipment:
                 (1) SPST SWITCH (found at your local Trash Shack)
                 (1) 10K OHM 1/2 WATT 10% RESISTOR (same as above)
                     SOME EXTRA WIRE (same as above above)
   Now disconnect the green wire in the box and connect it to one of the two 
   poles on the SPST switch. Take a piece of your extra wire connect one end 
   to the other pole on your SPST switch and the other end to the <RR> 
   terminal. Now place the 10k ohm resis
                     
                   --/-/--
                  :S P S T:
                   -------
                   ::   ::
  -----GREEN WIRE--::   ::----<RR>
                               !
                            10K OHM
                               !
                               !
     -----WHITE WIRE-----------\\
------BLUE WIRE-----------------<FF>

  This is simply the basic wireing, if you decide to become one with 
  advancement you might try hooking up lights to go on when your online or 
  perhaps a recorder, what-ever you wish.

Hell #3
   /EAVES-DROPPING/
 There are many various ways to accomplish this, seeing how I like to stick 
 to basics I will describe what I feel is the easiest by far. First you need 
 to make a linesmans handset as mentioned above if you already haven't. Now 
 simply disconnect the sending

More Hell:
    /OTHER TRICKS/
  You can set up a conference call simply by dialing your conference operator 
  (0-700-456-1000) and setting it up, just do what she says. I suggest this 
  operator for her lines are superior to those of the bitchy PBX ones. Oh, 
  you'll also need to know that l
   If you have an urge to get back at someone simply attach your linesmans 
   handset to the persons line (fine their line as mentioned many times before) 
   and leave it off the hook. You can imagine just how long it could take Ma's 
   loyal employees to discover 
    Using the persons line to call computer systems that trace. This also goes 
    under the heading 'getting back at people' for the hassles you'll cause 
    them when the line is traced to them is numerous, bitchy Ma employees tend 
    to be irrational, spoiled chil
     Bugging the operator - self explanatory.
                        RAISE HELL

 /Insider/ - The rest of this doc is mainly explanations, a little hell and a 
 few other things I decided to throw in instead of making another Vol.. It's 
 true purpose is to coincide with Vol. I, as well as take up space, the rest 
 is unkown.

       800 EXTENDERS
        -----------

Basically, 800 extenders are much like Save-Net or Am-Net going 800 instead 
of local access numbers. With these one can call anywhere in the U.S. for free, 
of course you need the X digit code, but this is easily found. You use these 
just like you would if 

1-800-                                  1-800-
-------                                 -------

243-7650 6 DIGITS                       328-7112  4 DIGITS
654-8494 6 DIGITS                       327-9895  7 DIGITS

      LOOP NUMBERS EXPLORED

Loop numbers simply conect two people together using two different numbers. 
Thus these numbers always come in pairs, one being the higher one while the 
other being the lower one. So if you were to use one, you would call one of 
the pair and the other one w
 Area Code 212
      XXX-9979 (HIGH)
      XXX-9977 (LOW)

XXX= 690,534,569,432,868,255,228,677,982,466,926,220,586,524,283

     XXX-9906 (HIGH)
     XXX-9900 (LOW)

XXX= 529,352,439,388

Where you see XXX you enter the prefix desired, thus if you wanted area code 
212, you could choose a prefix say 690, so one person would dial 690-9906 and 
the other 690-9900.
 In order to scan for loop numbers you'll need a friend to help. Loop numbers 
 run in pairs, the combination is 00XX and XX99. So what you need is for one 
 person to scan one end while the other scans the upper (using the same 
 prefix). the hang side has no t
  To use a loop number in order to start a conference call simply have one 
  person get on the hangside while another calls the conferenceing operator 
  (PBX operator will do). The person calling the operator (hopefully from a 
  fortress fone) should charge the

    Customer name and address

  A CN/A operator is disagnated for the use of AT&T employees who need some 
  information on a certain person. Ex- A Bell cop got a persons name from a 
  nark or whatever, he needs more info about the person so he calls up the 
  CN/A operator and asks her for th
