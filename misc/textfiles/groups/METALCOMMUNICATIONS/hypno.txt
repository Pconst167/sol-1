! What Hypnotism Is !
+-------------------+

Hypnotism, contrary to common beleif, is merely state when your mind and body
are in a state of relaxation and your mind is open to positive, or cleverly
worded negative, influences.  It is NOT a trance where you:

                                        o Are totally influencable.
                                        o Cannot lie.
                                        o A sleep which you cannot wake up from
                                          without help.

This may bring down your hopes somewhat, but, hypnotism is a powerful for
self help, and/or mischeif.

+-----------------------+
! Your Subconcious Mind !
+-----------------------+

  Before going in further, I'd like to state that hypnotism not only is great
in the way that it relaxes you and gets you (in the long run) what you want,
but also that it taps a force of incredible power, beleive it or not, this
power is your subconcious mind.  The subconcious mind always knows what is
going on with every part of your body, every moment of the day.  It protects
you from negative influences, and retains the power to slow your heartbeat
down and stuff like that.  The subconcious mind holds just about all the info
you would like to know about yourself, or, in this case, the person you will be
hypnotising.  There are many ways to talk to your subconcious and have it talk
back to you.  One way is the ouja board, no its not a spirit, merely the minds
of those who are using it.  Another, which I will discuss here, is the pendulum
method.  Ok, here is how it goes.  First, get a ring or a washer and tie it to
a thread a little longer than half of your forearm.  Now, take a sheet of paper
and draw a big circle in it.  In the big circle you must now draw a crosshair
(a big +).  Now, put the sheet of paper on a table.  Next, hold the thread
with the ring or washer on it and place it (holding the thread so that the
ring is 1 inch above the paper swinging) in the middle of the crosshair.  Now,
swing the thread so the washer goes up and down, say to yourself the word "yes"
Now, do it side to side and say the word "no".  Do it counter clockwise and say
"I don't know".  And lastly, do it clockwise and say "I dont want to say."
Now, with the thread back in the middle of the crosshair, ask yourself
questions and wait for the pendulum to swing in the direction for the answer.
(Yes, no, I dont know or I dont wanna say...).  Soon, to your amazement, it
will be answering questions like anything...  Let the pendulum answer, dont try
..  When you try you will never get an answer.  Let the answer come to you.

+-------------------------+
! How to Induce Hypnotism !
+-------------------------+

  Now that you know how to talk to your subconcious mind, I will now tell you
how to guide someone into hypnosis.  Note that I said guide, you can never,
hynotise someone, they must be willing.  Ok, the subject must be lying or sit-
ing in a comfortable position, relaxed, and at a time when things arent going
to be interrupted.  Tell them the following, or something close to it, in a
peaceful, monotinous tone (not a commanding tone of voice)

NOTE:  Light a candle and place it somewhere where it can be easily seen.

"  Take a deep breath through your nose and hold it in for the count of 8.
Now, through your mouth, exhale completely and slowly.  Continued breathing
long, deep, breaths through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.  Tense
up all your muscles very tight, now, counting from ten to one, release them
slowly, you will find them very relaxed.  Now, look at the candle, as you look
at it, with every breath and passing momement, you are feeling increasingly
more and more peaceful and relaxed.  The candles flame is peaceful and bright.
As you look At it I will count from 100 down, as a count, your eyes will become
more and more relaxed, getting more and more tired with each passing moment."

Now, count down from 100, about every 10 numbers say "When I reach xx your eyes
(or you will find your eyes) are becoming more and more tired."  Tell them they
may close their eyes whenever they feel like it.  If the persons eyes are
still open when you get to 50 then instead of saying "your eyes will.." say 
"your eyes are...".  When their eyes are shut say the following.

"....as you lie (or sit) here with your eyes comfortably close you find your
self relaxing more and more with each moment anD breath.  The relaxation feels pleasant and blissful so, you happily give way to this wonderful feeling."
" Imaginge yourself on a cloud, resting peacefully, with a slight breeze caressing your body.  A tingling sensasion begins to work its way, within and without your toes, it slowly moves up your feet, making them warm, heavy and relaxed.  The cloud is soft 

If they are not responsive or you think they (he or she..) is going to sleep,
then add in a "...always concentrating upon my voice, ingoring all other sounds
.  Even though other sounds exsist, they aid you in your relaxation..." 
They should soon let out a sigh as if they were letting go, and their face
should have a "woodeness" to it, becoming featurless...  Now, say the following

"....  You now find yourself in a hallway, the hallway is peaceful and nice.
As I count from 10 to 1 you will imagine yourself walking further and further
down the hall.  When I reach one you will find yourself where you want to be,
in another, higher state of concious and mind.  (Count from ten to one)....."

Do this about three or four times.  Then, to test if the subject is under
hypnosis or not, say....

"...You feel a strange sensation in your (arm they write with) arm, the feeling
begins at your fingers and slowly moves up your arm, as it moves through your
arm your arm becomes lighter and lighter, it will soon be so light it will rise
.....  Becoming lighter and lighter which each breath and moment..."

Their fingers should begin to twitch and then move up, the arm following, now
my friend, you have him/her in hypnosis.  The first time you do this, while
he/she is under say good things, like:  "your going to feel great tomorrow" or
"every Day in every way you will find yourself becoming better and better"..
Or some crap like that...  The more they go under, the deeper in hypnosis they
will get each time you do it.

+----------------------------+
! What to do when Hypnotised !
+----------------------------+

  When you have them under you must word things very carefully to get your way.
You cannot simply say...  Take off your clothes and hump the pillow.  No, that
would not really do the trick.  You must say something like....  "you find your
self at home, in your room and you have to take a shower (vividly describe
their room and whats happening), you begin to take off your clothes..."  Now,
it cant be THAT simple, you must know the persons house, room, and shower room.
Then describe things vividly and tell them to act it out (they have to be
DEEPLY under to do this...).  I would just suggest that you experiment a while,
and get to know how to do things.

+-----------+
! Waking Up !
+-----------+

  Waking up is very easy, just say..

"...as I count from 1 to 5 you will find yourself becomming more and more
awake, more and more lively.  When you wake up you will find yourself complete-
ly alive, awake, and refreshed.  Mentally and physically, remembering the
pleasant sensation that hypnosis brings...  Waking up feeling like a new born
baby, reborn with life and vigor, feeling excellent. Remembering that next time
you enter hypnosis it will become an ever increasing deeper and deeper state
than beforE.  1- you feel energy course throughout your limbs.  2- you begin
to breathe deeply, stirring.  3- begining to move more and more your eyes
open, bringing you up to full concious.  4- you are up,up, up and awakening
more and more. 5- you are awake and feeling great."

And thats it!  You now know how to hypnotise yourself and someone else.
You will learn more and more as you experiment.
