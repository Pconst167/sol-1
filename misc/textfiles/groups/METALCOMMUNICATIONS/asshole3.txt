 THE MORDOR AE-201-528-6467 PW:ZANDAR

======================================

This file is directed to better help all
you assholes out there who don't know   
how to use an AE line a little more wise
first of all,this is me (Zandar Zan)
and MS Reality..telewriting together 
from opposite sides of this great,
fantastic...worthless country of ours.....

    Let's go.....

Assholes login and type in S7 D1 V2
to catalog a volume.

Assholes always, always look at the '?'
option 3000 times before they finally
memorize it. 

Assholes hit C>opy to get a ware.

Assholes never, never upload anything 
better than '100 Different Ways to Eat 
Grapefruit' and then think that they are 
awesome for doing it.

Assholes always, always look at each
directory five times before looking at
anything, and then try to V>iew a binary
file.

Assholes always take everything on your
line, then page you 6000 times and when 
you finally answer, ask you to put more 
stuff up for them to D/L.

Assholes break out of the hello file
before they see the part saying...
'now run on 10 megs' then they rag on
you for not having anything up in
yer floppy drives.

Assholes post rag messages until they 
run out of space telling the sysop what 
a shitty system he has, because he 
doesnt have anything new up, even though 
he just D/L it the day before!

Assholes don't know what Dalton's is and 
assholes try to BRUN a game that
was split with Dalton's.

Assholes don't know the difference
between 'Dalton's' and 'Disk Rigger'
and post messages asking if there is
a difference and why.

Assholes can't figure out why they
can't R>eceive a game on the AE-line.

Assholes call up AE lines with Data-
Capture 4.0 and get upset when nothing
works...

Assholes call up AE lines and still
use Smartcom I.

Assholes don't know how to post private 
messages. 

Assholes who don't know how to post
private msgs put their home phone 
number in the msg anyway.

Assholes enter in the AE PW 40 times 
after they have already logged on, and
don't have a clue as to how to use the
system.

Assholes hit 'return' after typing
in the pswd to an AE-line.

Assholes type D>irectory and then return 
and wonder why it wont show the catalog.

Assholes use the C>opy function, then 
type away. when they are done, they 
type'/ex' and when that doesnt work. 
'help  me sysop!' and finally hang-up 
and call right back.

Assholes can't figure out why they 
can't D/L from an AE-line with their
C-64.

Assholes call the same AE line 10 times 
a day because it is local to see if 
there are any new wares to leech.

Assholes read a file giving them 
directions on how to use ae with a 
hard drive, then have to view it 4 times
because they forgot what they just read.

Assholes call up the AE-line again and
again after they just got a voice
answering saying the line is down,
call back later' thinking they got
a wrong number.

Assholes never say who they are when 
the sysop breaks in to chat..they give 
names like 'Mr. Who' and 'Dr. Nobody' 
and then when they decide to give their 
names out it is in the form of 'K-K00L' 
text gra-fix.

Assholes use spinning cursors and other
such K-K00L text graphics in their
welcome file on their hours AE's that
they set up two days a week from
3:26pm to 6:47 pm.

Assholes can't figure out why they got 
hung up on when the only left AE 
sitting there for 25 minutes without 
doing anything.

Assholes S>end a ware, then sit there 
and watch it get BS Errs and don't know
what they did wrong. (they don't know 
how to Ctrl-Q 'G' yet).

Let me reiterate something that has been 
said before....Assholes are assholes.

This is true, and will always remain so.
assholes are invariably stupid. Very,
very stupid. They don't know what is 
going on around them, or how to correct
the matter at any given time at all.
They are usually so stupid as to enter
the wrong PW to the system 8 times in 
a row, until the sysop prompts them thru
then they stare at the hello message un-
til AE hangs them up! What assholes!!

Assholes can't even read at the speed
of 300 baud, frequently Ctrl-S ing and
waiting 10 mins to read the page.

Assholes shit if the sysop wants to go 
voice because they still either have 
a 2600 hz tone voice or a 1000 hz tone
voice (both of which are really quite
annoying).

Assholes (AE assholes that is) read the
file saying what wares are in what
volume of a hard drive, then catalog
every volume anyway..also, assholes 
catalog every volume, then view the file
saying what wares are in what volume.

What total assholes!

Assholes copy their own 'Neet-0 K00L 
pagerzzz' onto the line which invariably 
feature real neat text graphics with a 
lot of Ctrl-G's...even though the sysop
stated in the hello message that either
his speaker was unplugged or he suppres
sed Ctrl-G...which of course they did 
not see, because they broke out of the
message prematurely.

Now, this is only a small part of what
AE assholes do. This is a guide direct-
ed towards those of you who fit in here
so you can learn to stop doing them and
driving your friendly, courteous, AE
sysops crazy with your lame assholeness
and general idioticness. 

In our next file, we will discuss the 
lifestyle of the AE asshole, to maybe
figure out what makes him so and why!

   This msg has been brought to
  you by  the Neon Knight Network.

      
Later and watch for the next file
from MS Reality and Zandar Zan 'the 
life and times of the AE asshole'.
