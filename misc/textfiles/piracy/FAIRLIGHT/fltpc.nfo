                               Proudly Presents

                           Castle of Dr. Brain Codes

                                    From

                               Sierra On-Line

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Code Notes:  Well Sierra does it again... Once agian they managed to
              integrate some type of sneaky copy protection into the game.
              The copy protection is integrated as part of one of the
              puzzles.  The first time it comes up is when you are
              inside the Castle and try to get through one of the doors.
              You get keywords from solving the puzzles, then when you
              try to get through the main door, you have to decode the
              keywords into a code with funky symbols and input the
              code to pass the door.  The enclosed GIF is a scan of
              the decoder part of the manual.  Print it out and use
              it to decode the keywords you are given.  This shit
              might pop up in other parts of the game too, we don't
              know yet, but this GIF will get you past it wherever
              it shows up.
              
              Before any of you go off half-cocked and bitch about us
              not cracking this, keep in mind that to crack this game
              would mean to solve the puzzle.  That would make the
              game just a bit pointless, since it is a puzzle game.

       We still need Christmas Couriers!  Only a few courier positions
       left!  We are in need of couriers available in the DAYTIME.  If
       you are available during weekdays and interested in couriering
       for USA/FLT, please fill out the enclosed USACOUR.APP and send
       it on up to BBS-A-Holic.

                 = SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT FROM LORD STERLING =
                 -*****************************************-

      As you may have noticed, my name has been showing up in both THG's
      and USA's .NFO files.  Effectively, this obviously concocted  much
      confusion.  Personally, I don't know what's going on.  My guess,
      it's a canny way of THG's endeavor to ask me back, I wish I knew!

      Since  THG's Member  eradication, which  included me,  I have  NOT
      been in contact with ANY of the  THG Members  neither directly nor
      indirectly.  When USA formed, I was right there with them.  Almost
      immediately  after THG learned I  was in this new  Ex-THG Member's
      Group, I was conveniently put right back into the THG .NFO file as
      a Member; like nothing happened, right?   My name has been popping
      in and  out of   the THG  .NFO   since  the  beginning  of   USA's
      establishment.   It's thoroughly confused me as well as all of you
      that have been  paying attention.   I'll  continue to support ONLY
      one group ... USA/FLT!

                                         Regards,

                                         Lord Sterling

                         To the Head Honcho at THG:

      Please save us all the confusion.  From now on, omit me from  your
      .NFO files.   Much Appreciated!
