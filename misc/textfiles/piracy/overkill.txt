         We do not want anyone to get the wrong idea about our group.  We are
  not here in the 914 area-code to reak havok.  The purpose of our group is
  to eliminate lamerism of any way, shape, or form.  We have 4 members that
  will find very illustrious ways to do this.
         First off, what some people may wonder is, "What constitutes being
  lame"?  Well, if you're asking yourself that question, then you are, in
  fact, lame.  We, for the most part, only harass lamers in their purest
  form.  For instance, rarely, if ever, do we harass 9600 baud or above
  users.  The majority of the time its a 2400 baud or below user. In my honest
  opinion, a person is lame no matter what baud rate they are at, but being
  that Overkill is a group of compassionate people, we see that the "lame"
  9600+ users at least have potential to become elite.  2400- users have no
  hope in this matter.
         We will work with the Elite SysOp's to eliminate the lamers off of
  their respective BBS's.  All Elite SysOp's are more than happy to comply
  with us, because they want to eliminate lamerism as much as we do, they
  just don't want to be as radical as we are in order to accomplish it.  If
  they have no intention of eliminating their lame users, then they are lame
  and will pay the price.  That is how we go about eliminating lamers off of
  Elite BBS's.



         But then there, of course, is what we call the "Ultra-Lamer".  An
   Ultra-Lamer is user who is lame enough to start his own BBS.  Its not
   enough that they start a BBS like this, but it is a breeding ground for
   lamers.  This MUST be stopped.  These systems must be eliminated in the
   BBS community.  This is the biggest help in the elimination of lamerism.
   If you kill the breeding grounds, lamers will have no where to go and will
   wither away into nothingness.
         We will strike without warning, and we do not announce our presence
   until well after we have struck.  We have already struck in this part of
   the 914 area code several times.  Have you noticed being deleted off of
   the better-known BBS's lately?  Have you noticed that a few of the boards
   you have called recently have just kept ringing with no answer?  This is
   what Overkill is all about.
         Some people may ask, "Why release a text file, it makes everyone
   be more careful and makes Overkill less effective."  On the contrary, this
   is just our way of giving users another chance.  It gives the SysOp of a
   lamer board the chance to get rid of all the lamers and dead-accounts, and
   gives them ample time to shut their BBS's down before we do.
         But be warned, we may strike again and we may not.  We haven't
   eliminated all the lamers in this area code, and we know that some of the
   lamers that we have affected so far are so lame that they will be back.
   We will continue to harass these lamers and Ultra-Lamers until they depart,
   or have realized their lameness and start to do something about it.

         We have begun to take matters in our own hands in this part of the 914
   area code.  Be warned nad take appropriate action or feel our wrath.  These
   are a few examples of those who already have.

       Crash Type    -  ELMINATR.COM
       Result        -  Wounded
       Crash Notes   -  This kid gives new meaning to the term "Ultra-Lamer".
                        Not only is he lame (and at 1200 baud no less), but he
                        has the nerve to run a board.  The Elite boards were
                        probably outraged.  We nailed him with Piper's FAT
                        Eliminator v1.01 (yeah, the buggy version), and it put
                        Kelson down, but not out.  In my opinion, the best part
                        was hearing about how Kelson broke down and cried about
                        getting hit.  The psychological damage gives me such an
                        uplifting feeling.  Special thanks go out to RatCrap
                        for the accounts and his undying effort.  The accounts
                        weren't infallible, but we got our point across.

       Crash Type    -  PasLok III
       Result        -  Out of Commision
       Crash Notes   -  This guy is a complete asshole.  It took me well over
                        an hour to obliterate his system, but when all was
                        said and done, he had absolutely nothing.  No sub-
                        -directories, no files.  He runs his system under DOS
                        3.30, which means I, not only had to delete his C:
                        partition, but his C:, D:, E:, F:, G:, and H:, not to
                        mention his B: Floppy Drive (no one ever accused me of
                        NOT being thorough).  We proceeded to create prevent
                        files on his D: so he couldn't recover any of his
                        needed files, exited through a bogus batch file, and
                        locked up his system via line noise.  Special thanks go
                        out to AccuPunk for his modifications on PasLok III,
                        which enabled me to go directly to the DOS Shell from
                        logon prompt under The Ultra-Lamer himself, Kelson

   3.  System Name   -  MicroTech BBS
       Phone #       -  (914)896-5194
       SysOp Handle  -  THE ACE
       Crash Date    -  03/23/91 at 8:00pm
       Crasher       -  FasTrash
       Crash Type    -  ELMINATR.COM
       Result        -  Out of Commision
       Crash Notes   -  This one was fun.  To make a long story short, the
                        guy practically ASKED me to crash his system.  I
                        couldn't help but oblige.  He lost absolutely every-
                        thing, never to see them again.  He wasn't typical in
                        the way he handled it, he never told a soul to my
                        knowledge, just something about his board being down
                        due to a software change.  It took no time at all, it
                        was a "done-deal" after finally getting by all of the
                        annoying "well's and ok's" that occured every damn time
                        he chatted me.  A VERY special thanks go to Piper for
                        his latest version of FAT Eliminator v1.02 written in
                        the latest (beta) version of TASM.  Good work!




   4.  System Name   -  Danger Zone
       Phone #       -  (914)297-6651
       SysOp Handle  -  PC Kid
       Crash Date    -  3/29/91 at 8:46pm
       Crasher       -  FasTrash
       Crash Type    -  ELMINATR.COM
       Result        -  Out of Commision
       Crash Notes   -  This was a group effort.  The whole gang was there to
                        watch PC Kid and the Danger Zone go down.  We used
                        Piper's latest FAT Eliminator v1.02 to pull this one
                        off.  PC Kid, like THE ACE, was nice enough to let us
                        enter DOS and do it ourselves right in front of his
                        eyes.  He had 2 partitions, the only reason I didn't
                        eliminate his D: drive was because it was under Stacker
                        and it wasn't worth the extra 10 seconds to knock it
                        out.  I don't give PC Kid enough credit to be able to
                        get it back.  We were curteous enough to leave him a
                        message that we had struck, and were nice enough to
                        voice him moments later for our own ammusement.  We had
                        been told that he ran a good board, but when we found
                        out how lame it was, we had to make an example of him.



         Remember, just because we hit these systems once, doesn't mean we
  won't strike them again.  If you are a user on any of the boards that have
  been hit, the only thing we can tell you is to GET OFF, before we make your
  usership miserable.  But, we do not want other boards to become terrified of
  us unneedingly.  The following boards will NOT be destroyed by Overkill:

                          McClusky's Bar & Grill
                          The Phortrii
                          Castle Wolfenstein
                          Night Stalker's Asylum

         Just because your BBS name is not on this list, does not mean that
   we will destroy it, we have not been in the 914 area code long enough to
   be familiar with all the Users/SysOps/Systems.


                                       Sincerely yours-
                                                        Overkill

And remember - Eliminate the Lame!

         This just in:  Rumors have been flying everywhere that
                        The Dude's board, "The Easy Way out BBS",
                        is unconditionally down.  Rumor has it that
                        he was living in fear of his system being
                        Trashed (tm), because of what he heard from
                        the SysOps you read about in the previous
                        pages.  I commend you, The Dude, for taking
                        the first step toward Eliteness.  You may
                        be far from Elite, but realizing that is half
                        the battle.  This is just another notch in
                        Overkill's bedpost.
