
                    PIRACY BY TEACHERS??

        I was shocked that after watching a stupid Video Tape
critisizing and Stating how stupid Hackers and Pirates are (Which is
not true of course), that the school is using pirated software? Yes,
that's right, If you will notice the next time you use Print shop in
the computer room, that it says "Cracked By Mr. Krackman." So I've
decided to start a column on unprotecting IBM programs... To start it
off, here's one for News Room and Kings Quest III.


The following debug session will alow you to copy the Newsroom files to any
disk and run them from that disk.
However, the Newroom program will still want you to enter the clip-art disks
in drive A: and any banner, panel, or wire service disks in will also have to
be put in drive A:.
None of the disks need any copy protection, so therefore can be copied from
disk to disk and still be run.

Just follow the instructions carefully.

First copy all the Newsroom files on to a clean disk.
Also copy the Debug program on to the same disk.

RENAME  NWSRM.EXE  1
DEBUG   1
-E 691A EB 41
-E 6973 90 90
-E 6977 EB 25 90
-
{THE FOLLOWING PORTION IS TELLING THE NEWSROOM DISK WHERE TO FIND CERTAIN FILES
 SUCH AS LOGO.PIC, NRTITLE.PIC, NRSETUP, ALONG WITH ALL THE PRINTER AND MODEM
 CONFIG TABLES.}

AT THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS ENTER THE APPROPRIATE HEX VALUE:
FOR DRIVE A: 41
FOR DRIVE B: 42
FOR DRIVE C: 43
FOR DRIVE D: 44

-E 9BA5 XX
-E 9CD4 XX
-E 9D9D XX
-E 9DAA XX
-E 9DB7 XX

             WHERE XX = THE DRIVE NUMBER DESIGNATED ABOVE

-W
-Q

DEBUG NWSRM22.OVL
-E 10C6 B8 05 43
-W
-Q

That's all there is to it.  Now just copy it over to any disk you want and
run it from there.  Just remember that it is going to look for certain files
on the drive that you told it before in the debug session.

NPROTECTING KINGS QUEST III - IBM PC VERSION
---------------------------------------------

To unprotect Kings Quest III, you will need a DOS disk with DEBUG.COM,
the original master diskette 1, a freshly formatted diskette, and
about 15 minutes.

Boot the system with a standard DOS disk and answer the date and time
prompts. Place the Kings Quest disk in the A drive and the DOS disk
with DEBUG in the B drive. Enter the following lines, explanations and
non key strokes are shown in parenthesis.

A>B:DEBUG SIERRA.COM
-G100,3E4              (during this time the KQ disk will run,
                        you will be prompted to press ENTER twice)
(remove the KQ disk and place the freshly formatted diskette in the A drive)
-A100

(Place the original KQ disk in the B drive and enter the following.

COPY B:AGI
COPY B:*.OVL
COPY B:WORD.TOK
COPY B:OBJECT
COPY B:LOGDIR
COPY B:SNDDIR
COPY B:VIEWDIR
COPY B:PICDIR

(Have fun!  KQ should also be able to be used on a hard drive with this
 procedure, but hasn't been tried.)

|                           (INT 13 and DOS files)                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      This is a Tutorial on Cracking.  Let's start out with a simple defintion
for the word "CRACKING".  Cracking is the art or STRIPPING the protection off a
disk or file.  Thus allowing that program to run on a Hard Disk or be copied
freely.  In the case of a whole disk, the disk must be decoded and converted
into a file.  This process is rather hard to do so I will discuss it in 
ter Tutorial.
      In this tutorial,  I will explain how to beat the "INT13 Protection".
this routine is used on most disks today.  In this tutorial I will make
refrence to these programs

                          LOCKSMITH - Aplha Logic
                          PCWATCH   - IBM
                          FSD       - IBM

                          You can use these programs or any others that
do the same things.  DiskMechanic will work in place of Locksmith (used for
analyss of Track information.)  TRAP13 will replace PCWATCH (to find where
the program access INT 13h), and dos's DEBUG will surfice for FSD.  Please
remember that if you use DEBUG on and ".EXE" file, you will first need to
rename it "filename.ZAP" and when in debug, all address are +100h.
      In this tutorial, We will go thru and crack "The Ancient Art of War".
we will start by analyzing the disk with Locksmith and End of Changeing it with
DEBUG (if you are asking why I am using debug, when I cracked it I didn't have
FD.)
     The first thing we will do is analyze the disk with LOCKSMITH.  We search
both sides of the disk using the "Analyze" command in the track menu.  We mark
down the sector that have high SECTOR NUMBERING, WRONG N SIZE, or CRC ERRORS.
     Make carefull note of these numbers for we will need them in the future.
Now Exit Locksmith and Enter PCwatch.  EXCLUDE everything in window #1 execpt
"CARRY FLAG SET", INCLUDE [F1] this.  Go over to window #3 and hit PgDn until
you see the INT13 options.  INCLUDE "READ SECTOR".  In window #2 tell it to
output to printer.  Now exit the program [F4].  Place the AAOW (ancient art of
war) disk in drive A:.  Type "A>WAR".  The Game will load but slowly and the
printer will run.  When the game is loaded replace the AAOW disk with DOS and
reboot.  Take the listing and examine it.  Forget about any call from
[0070:xxxx] for these are used to load in the program.
     Now make a copy of you war disk using DISKCOPY or LOCKSMITH sector copy.
This will be out work cpy.  Debug the main program on the disk [WAR.EXE].
Examine the listing from PCWATCH.  Find the First address [nnnn:XXXX] besides
[0070:xxxx].  In AAOW it is or rather should be [nnnn:8BDA]. unassemble [U]
10 bytes back [U 8BAA].  This allows us to see the int13.  The next instruction
after the CD 13 [INT 13h] should either be a CMP or a JMP of some sort.  In
most protection routines usually have a JC or JB after their INT13.
     You must decide now what is needed to be done here according to the jumps
seen.  If a JC or JB follow INT13 then try this.  Replace INT13 (2 bytes CD 13)
with STC & NOP. These 2 command SET the CARRY Flag.  If the program Doesn't
rechange "STC" to "CLC".  The CLC is one of the most used ways to get around
INT13 protection.  AAOW uses "CLC".  It goes out and looks for a Sector.  If
it is not found then it has an Error.  The CLC hardwires the Error.  Write
the file out again.
     You have now cracked your first program (with a little HELP.)  You can
use this techinque on st DOS files.  Please remember, after you crack
something, leave the UNPROTECT on your local board so other can use them.

There are a couple of unprotects going around for this piece of software.
This one is rather short but others make you change 51 other bytes that seem
to be unneeded.  You will need DEBUG for you dos diskette and a Copy (doesn't
matter if it works) of NewsRoom.

      At Dos: A> Ren nwsrm.exe nwsrm.zap
              A> Debug nwsrm.zap

You will need:  Dos DEBUG
                A formatted Blank diskette
                A non working copy of the program

This tutorial show how defeat prolock on dBASE III but can be used for most
prolocked disks.

                    A> Debug DBASE.exe
                      -R

       You will now see whats in the registers.  Record the values
                      -U
                      -U

     Look for a LOOP instruction.  The next instruction will be a XCHG.
     Using the Address in the first column [091B:XXXX  92   XCHG  DX,AX]
     enter            -G XXXX
                      -S 100 3000 83 c4 08

     Some address will be listed.  Take the last address 091b:XXXX and
                      -A XXXX
                        XOR AX,AX

     Press Return twice until the "-" prompt. enter
                      -S 100 3000 C0 45 F8
     This will display a single value [091B:XXXX].  use it and enter

  Locksmith is in my oppion the BEST copy program for the IBMpc.  Using
Special Parameters Locksmith can copy almost anything.  I hope to explain to
all you PC Pirates how to use this great program.  This is first in a 2 part
series on the use of locksmith.

Window #1:  Current Track Window.  This window is used for selecting what
          Tracks are to be used.  To get to this window press the [F1] key.
          If a number (Track) has a "." under it then it is to be used.
          The SPACEBAR is used to toggle a single Track.  The "+" key is
          used to toggle the whole side of a disk.  Left and Right Arrows
          keys are used to move the cursor.

Window #2:  This is the Sector window.  Here you will find the Size (N) and
          the Error in the sector if any and the percent of the track taken up
          by that sector.  By examine the sector's number you can find out how
          how the sectors are really numbered because some protection schemes
          use abnormal sector numbering.  HOME will take you to the top of the
          screen to the Number of sectors [SECTORS: 00] prompt.  This is used
          in creating your own protection schemes which will be explained in
          the next issue of KRACK: [F2] get this window

Window #3:  The data window can be used to examine, edit and create data to
          be written out to the disk.  So protection schemes need certain
          bytes to be changed.  [F3] get you here while [F9] toggle Ascii/Hex
          display.  If a search string has been entered then [F10] will start
          the search.

Copying something with locksmith is pretty easy.  If the disk is unprotected
then use the BACKUP in the SECTOR utilitys.  If the disk is protected then
you must use the BACKUP in the TRACK utilitys.  The best way to copy a
protected diskette is the first to Slow Copy the whole disk [TRACK utilitys]
then write down any odd tracks (more sectors than the other errors etc.).
Use Fast copy [SECTOR utilitys] to copy similar track then use Slow copy to
copy the Fuckup tracks.
