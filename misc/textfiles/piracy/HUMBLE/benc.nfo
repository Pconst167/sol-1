Crack: Name this Track
Graphics: CGA/EGA/TDY/VGA
Controls: Joystick/Mouse/Keyboard
Sound: Regular/Unleaded/Premium

Cracking/Game Notes:

	This looks like the INDY 500 of NASCAR Racing GREAT graphics.
	The protection was exactly the same as Stunts, (Mainly because it
	is the SAME type).  It is kinda ironic, I spent a while today
	looking through Stunts (I had no idea the protection was the same).
	Anyway, they have tables of the Op codes that the program uses, and
	they write out odd-ball code to get a byte from their file, and do a
	calculation on it, and us that value to pull the byte out of the table
	and put it in the program.  Sounds easy enough right?  Well, the
	statement that they use to pull the byte out of the table is the part
	that keeps me from byte-cracking this.  It is something to the tune
	of:     MOV     AX,[DX+BP+FE02].  And last but not least, the
	calculations that they do to get the offset won't allow you to access
	every byte.  FUN FUN FUN!
