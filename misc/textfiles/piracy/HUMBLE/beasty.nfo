                          Altered Beasty Boy by Sega
            Cracked by R. Bubba Magillicutty and Fabulous Furlough

GRAPHICS: HGC/CGA/TDY/EGA/"VGA"
SOUND:    IBM/TDY/Adlib
CONTROLS: Keyboard/Joystick
SPAM:     Not tonight, you give me a head-ache.

NOTES:
        Press F1 from the title screen for a key quick-reference.  The adlib
sounds just like the arcade game, except the lame "roar" when you change.

CRACKING NOTES:
        This one was interesting.  A little different from the traditional
Sega protection, but not much.  It has two methods - running from floppy uses
a traditional INT 13-based read, then runs part of the code it read in (or
just uses the info to tell it where to jump to.)  If you install to a hard
drive, it modifies the root directory around the directory name where you
installed it.  We forced it to think it was always on a hard drive.  It also
checked to see if it was running from a directory right below the root dir. 
It wouldn't let you run it in something below that, i.e. you couldn't install
it to \games\beasty.  Now you can.  You're welcome.
        This was sort of a co-crack.  Actually, we pretty much both did it
separately.  Fabulous Furlough had it almost working but didn't know it when
he called me and gave it to me.  He got it far enough to get a "FILE NOT
FOUND" error from LOAD.  But it turned out that it always does that if you
don't let it get called by BEAST.  I had more fun with it.  I ran the ACCESS
thing which modifies your hard drive root dir.  It refused to run under
Compaq DOS.  Of course both computers here run Compaq DOS.  So I booted up
with a floppy, cracked the ACCESS install program, and got it to run.  That's
when I told FF that you can't just run LOAD.  From there we both fixed it up
on our own, giving each other bad advice along the way to make cracking it
take longer.
