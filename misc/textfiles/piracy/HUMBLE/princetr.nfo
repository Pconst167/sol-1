Ok, here is the Trainer, R. Bubba asked me to do it, so here it is..  There
are a few hitched to it, but don't blame me, it was the way that it was
written.  If you fall on spikes, or have a long fall, and you end up on
your back with blood on the floor, you have to do a CTRL-A to restart the
level, this has the same function that dying does, but you have to do it..
Another helpful hint, is to never attack someone if you don't have the sword
yet..  Anyway, have Fun... I really like this game.. I have reason to believe
that there are somewhere around 16 levels or so..I saw compares for stuff
around in that area...

A Special Message to The Knack - Great Work on Hard Drivin'  That Copy Lock is
a Bitch isn't it??  If you want more info on Rob Northern Computing, look in
the back of a PC Magazine in the little ads under protection, and they usually
have an ad in there...
