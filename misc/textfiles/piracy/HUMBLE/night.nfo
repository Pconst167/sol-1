  SL Here again. Well, I hear that INC has become SOOO desperate that they
actually sent one of their members to europe to get european games. But of
course, we beat them still. This is a nice little game straight from our
"French Connection". However, unlike MOST UBI Soft games, this one is in
English. Special Greets HAVE to go to JROK.

  Game Play:  Basically you're Count Dracula. You have to go around and
shoot these nasty's. I didn't really get into the game that thoroughly
simply because I don't like games that don't support my soundblaster.
Also this game is VERY difficult to play without a joystick. So if you
don't have one, then this might not be the game for you..

   Airing Dirty laundry: I have been informed that The 2 Humble Crew
are going on tour. They have a scheduled concert date in Vegas during
Comdex. They even will have their own booth set aside, so why don't you
all stop by Comdex and meet your heros. We (The Humble Guys) will be having
an 'Autograph Signing Party' on Saturday the 10th, leave Email to your
favorite Humble Guy on your Favorite Humble BBS for more information.
YES - You too can have your picture taken with a god holding a can of spam.

  Well thats it for this one, see you all in our next crack.. Watch out
for Space Ace, it's comming real soon, by THG of course. If you haven't
received the Demo for it, PICK IT UP! This game is GOING to change the way
we play games on our IBM.
