                            Gremlins ][ : The New Batch
                                Hi Tech Expressions

Packaged: Belgarion
Supplier: Genesis
Cracking: None
Graphics: CGA/EGA/TANDY
Controls: Joystick/Keyboard
Sound: PC Squeegee

Cracking/Game Notes:

No protection.  This is NOT the Gremlins II that was released a while back.
This is a totally different game, by a different comany.  This one isn't as 
good as the other one, but it's a new release.  Not often that you find a 
totally different game, with the same name..  Wierd..

breakup?)
