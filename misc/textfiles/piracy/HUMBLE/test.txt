Duck Tales is the newest game from THG...
It is a fairly simple game with good graphics in
EGA.. that is all I have...
 
When you start out pick a space to go to then
you get to start flying a plane this is fairly simple
to do....  Then when you get there you go either into
caves or a jungle...  You are equipped with a grappling
hook and rope... 
 
To use the rope:  Press down the space bar and keep it down
                  until you think you can reach the next tier.
                  If the next tier is close enough you can press
                  up arrow and that will make you jump.
Occasionally there will be a Beagle Boy with a gun shooting at you...
(life is so unfair all you have is a fucking hook and rope!) anyways 
to avoid the Beagle Boy just duck (down arrow) and go about your 
business...  Well that is all I have encountered...
 
Have fun.
 
Thanks go to:  C Serpent for play testing and Lord Blix for cracking it.
