[uwould be better to go outside of the[7Hgroup to elect a new one.  Therefore, we would like to announce that we have a[8Hnew Vice President, inducted via UNANIMOUS vote, Meaty Pete.  Yes, this is the[9Hsame Meaty Pete that crushed 415's Prodigy no[s
[ude (to those who have heard about[10Hthat), and has nailed other boards in such lame area codes as 416 and 504 (thatsCanada for you lamers out there).  Welcome, Meaty Pete, may you become a force[12Hin the quest to Eliminate Lamerism.[13H[14H[s
[u[9CThe fight against lamerism is a never-ending battle.  Anyone who has[15Hbeen in the BBS community for any length of time, knows that there are lamers[16Heverywhere.  If you can be as passionate in the fight against lamerism, and can[17Hbe of [s
[uhelp to our group, then fill out OVERKILL.APP, a small application to[18Hbecome an Overkill Member.  We do not accept just anyone, so if don't waste our[19Htime, only fill it out if you fit into the category we stated. You can put this[20Hfile on[s
[u any one of the following boards-[21H[22CMagical Mystery Board (New York City)[22H[22CHMS Queen's Revenge   (  California )[23HWe will designate a site for the 914 area code shortly.[0m
[40m[2J[2H[3H[4H[9C[0mWe do not want anyone to get the wrong idea about our group.  We are[5H  not here in the 914 area-code to reak havok.  The purpose of our group is[6H  to eliminate lamerism of any way, shape, or form.  We have 4 members t[s
[uhat[7H  will find very illustrious ways to do this.[8H[9CFirst off, what some people may wonder is, "What constitutes being[9H  lame"?  Well, if you're asking yourself that question, then you are, in[10H  fact, lame.  We, for the most part, onl[s
[uy harass lamers in their purest[11H  form.  For instance, rarely, if ever, do we harass 9600 baud or above[12H  users.  The majority of the time its a 2400 baud or below user. In my honest[13H  opinion, a person is lame no matter what baud rate t[s
[uhey are at, but being[14H  that Overkill is a group of compassionate people, we see that the "lame"[15H  9600+ users at least have potential to become elite.  2400- users have no[16H  hope in this matter.[17H[9CWe will work with the Elite SysOp[s
[u's to eliminate the lamers off of[18H  their respective BBS's.  All Elite SysOp's are more than happy to comply[19H  with us, because they want to eliminate lamerism as much as we do, they[20H  just don't want to be as radical as we are in order [s
[uto accomplish it.  If[21H  they have no intention of eliminating their lame users, then they are lame[22H  and will pay the price.  That is how we go about eliminating lamers off of[23H  Elite BBS's.[0m
[40m[2J[2H[3H[9C[0mBut then there, of course, is what we call the "Ultra-Lamer".  An[4H   Ultra-Lamer is user who is lame enough to start his own BBS.  Its not[5H   enough that they start a BBS like this, but it is a breeding ground for[6H   l[s
[uamers.  This MUST be stopped.  These systems must be eliminated in the[7H   BBS community.  This is the biggest help in the elimination of lamerism.[8H   If you kill the breeding grounds, lamers will have no where to go and will[9H   wither away [s
[uinto nothingness.[10H[9CWe will strike without warning, and we do not announce our presence[11H   until well after we have struck.  We have already struck in this part of[12H   the 914 area code several times.  Have you noticed being deleted off[s
[u of[13H   the better-known BBS's lately?  Have you noticed that a few of the boards[14H   you have called recently have just kept ringing with no answer?  This is[15H   what Overkill is all about.[16H[9CSome people may ask, "Why release a text [s
[ufile, it makes everyone[17H   be more careful and makes Overkill less effective."  On the contrary, this[18H   is just our way of giving users another chance.  It gives the SysOp of a[19H   lamer board the chance to get rid of all the lamers and [s
[udead-accounts, and[20H   gives them ample time to shut their BBS's down before we do.[21H[9CBut be warned, we may strike again and we may not.  We haven't[22H   eliminated all the lamers in this area code, and we know that some of the[23H   lam[A
[6Cers that we have affected so far are so lame that they will be back.[0m
[40m[2J[2H[3H[9C[0mWe have begun to take matters in our own hands in this part of the 914[4H   area code.  Be warned and take appropriate action or feel our wrath.  These[5H   are a few examples of those who already have.[6H[46C[1mÚÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂÂ[s

[40m[2J[2H[3H[0m1.  Kelson Haldane  -  He's layed kind of low since being wounded.  He seems[4Hto have realized his lameness, and is taking a step in the right direction by[5Hkeeping a lower profile than than before.  You did, however, put your [s
[ulame[6Hboard back up, which we were unhappy about, not to mention you posting ads for[7Ha 1200 baud board?!  Put your down before we do.  The only other obsticle on[8Hthe road to becoming Elite is your continual association with-[9H[10H2.  Dr. [s
[uScience[5C-  I hate you.  You are Lamerism in its' purest form.[11HWhile Kelson has moved from Ultra-Lame up to lame, you managed to go from lame[12Hto sub-Ultra-Lame in a matter of days.  We know about your little conversation[13Hwith Blue Jay [s
[uLamer from 313, we thought obliterating his board was a must, I[14Hcan't beleive you even had the nerve to put your lame board back up.  How many[15Hmore times am I going to have to erase all of your files before you get the[16Hmessage.  The only[s
[u thing I have to tell you is that you BETTER put your board[17Hdown, throw away your modem, and be a good little boy, or we'll have to send[18HMORE people over to your house to smash eggs into your mailbox.  This is a[19Hpersonal thing for me now[s
