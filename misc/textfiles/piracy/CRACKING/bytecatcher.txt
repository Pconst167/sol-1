Name:Byte Catcher 1.01 d
Where:http://www.save-it.com
Type of protection:serial number
Description:This is a neat little program that allows you to resume a
            download off of an ftp, even after disconnection, by just
	    hitting the "Go" button.  Some disadvantages are that it 
	    doesn't have a retry feature incase the server is full and
	    you can't change the port number.

Tools you will need to crack this program:  Soft-ice 3.0 or better
					    A piece of paper to write the
					    correct serial # down

How to crack this program:

Step 1.)Load Byte Catcher 1.01 and select "About" from the "Help" menu.
Step 2.)Click on register and fill out the information it asks for.  I 
        used this:
	66696669
	Manson69
	mExElitE/c4n '97
	DO NOT HIT ENTER YET!!!
Step 4.)Press ctrl-D to enter Soft-ice and set a break point on hmemcpy by 
	typing "bpx hmemcpy" (without quotation marks.)
Step 5.)Leave Soft-ice by hitting ctrl-D or F5.  Then hit "Ok."
Step 6.)You will be back in Soft-ice now.  Hit ctrl-D or F5 two more times
	to allow Byte Catcher to read all the information you entered in the
	boxes.
Step 7.)Now hit F12 until you get out of the 16-bit protected code and into 
	the 32-bit code.
	XXXX:XXXX <----4 digits followed by a colon and 4 more digits 
		       indicates that you are in 16-bit protected mode
	XXXX:XXXXXXXX <----4 digits followed by a colon and 8 more digits
			   indicates that you are in 32-bit code.
Step 8.)Now lets scan for the serial number that we entered.  We do this by 
	typing "s 0 l ffffffff 'your code here'" (without the quotation
	marks but WITH the ' ' marks.)  My serial number was 66696669 so I 
	entered:
	s 0 l ffffffff '66696669'
	It will then find you your code at a given address.  My serial 
	number was found at the address 013F:00A22FAC.  Lets now set a
	break point on this memory location by typing:
	bpm 013F:00A22FAC <----Your memory address will probably be different
Step 9.)Hit ctrl-D or F5 to leave Soft-ice and low and behold you are right
	back in Soft-ice! You will end up in code similar to this:
	0137:00418936  8A02     MOV   AL,[EDX]   <--This moves what is in 
						    memory at EDX to AL
	0137:00418938  3A06     CMP   AL,[ESI]   DS:0047B14C=37   <--This 
								     compares
								     what is
								     in 
								     memory
								     at AL
								     and ESI
	0137:0041893A  751E     JNZ   0041895A   <--Acts as a result of the 
						    compare.
	This is the code that we need to be concerned with.  The brackets
	around EDX and ESI indicate that you are dealing with thier what is 
	in their memory location not their values.  If you do a 
	d edx
	and view the what is in memory on EDX you will see the code you
	entered.  If you do a 
	d esi
	you will see the correct code.  Note down the correct code,type 
	"bc *" (without quotation marks) to clear all break points.  Then
	enter the correct serial number in place of the one you entered and
	hit "Ok" and it will register!
Final Notes: If you try don't enter the correct serial number, but change the
	     registration name and company and follow these steps over you
	     will see that the registration code doesn't change.  This
	     program has one universal registration code.  Which mean that
	     you can enter the same serial number with any name and/or
	     company and it will register!  Due to this fact a key maker/
	     generator or crack/patch is not needed.  
	     Hope that this tutorial worked for you!
