              Ok, in   this  textfile,  I  will  start  talking  about
         removing doc check protection schemes.  I find, the doc check
         scheme to be slightly more difficult  to  work on than normal
         INT 13 schemes.

              What is  a  doc  check.   Usually, a doc  check  when  a
         program ask the  user to enter a phrase or code supplied with
         the manual.  Now, one might think  that  "Shit,  we  can just
         type all the codes in to a textfile and upload  it  with  the
         DOCS", but that  way of thinking breaks down on programs such
         as Future Classics where there  are  6  pages  with about 200
         codes per page.   So  it is just better to remove  the  check
         completely.

              In this  primer, I will get in to the theory of removing
         a doc check, then start with  a  simple  example  (Electronic
         Art's ESCAPE FROM HELL).  Then in the next file,  I will take
         you deeper in  to  the world of doc checks and work with more
         difficult examples.  But for now, lets get started.

              A doc check, in basic theory works much like normal
         INT 13 copy protection.  Somewhere  in  the  beginning of the
         program before it really starts, the check is  made.   If the
         result is ok  (ie the user enters the correct word or phrase)
         then the program continues.  If  not, then the program simply
         exits to dos.

              Simple right,  well  not  really.   Usually,  the  input
         routine is part  of the standard input routine of the program
         so you just can't go about modify  the  call  to INT 16h (the
         keyboard interrupt) like you could with INT 13h.   So,  where
         do we start.   If  you  think back to cracking the old INT 13
         protection schemes, you would  use  a program like PCWATCH or
         TRAP13 to get a rough idea of where the call  resides.   With
         doc checks, this is really not the best way to do it.

              I suggest  that  you try to break in to the program well
         before the protection is checked.   Remember,  we must remove
         the check without messing with the actual input routine so we
         want to come in highest level.

              So, how  do we break in.  By using a good  debugger.   I
         suggest Periscope.  I find it is the best and easiest to use.
         Once we are  in,  all  the  is  left  is to trace through the
         program until we find the topmost call to the doc check.  Now
         we're moving.

              So let's say we have broken  in to the program and found
         the topmost call to the doc check.  What next.   We  must try
         to figure out   what   the   program   does.    There  are  2
         possibilities.  First, the program  could  simply  check  the
         inputed string against a value in memory, and  if  they don't
         match simply exit  to  dos and if they do, just continue with
         the program; or if the input  matches  it  can  set a flag in
         memory that is checked by some routine later.

              So, on  to  the  example.   NOTE! All address  might  be
         different.  This is  how  it  looked when I cracked it.  ALSO
         NOTE, you should  be cracking  without  any  memory  resident
         programs.  Make sure MEMORY is clear, and that  you  load the
         system the same   way  each  time.   Remember,  if  you  load
         everything the same, everything  will  be  in the same memory
         location.

              So, what is our first step.  Well, I suggest picking out
         the right tools to do the job.  In this case,  You  will only
         need PERISCOPE (and  the  addin  program  that  comes with it
         called PSKEY) and a good file editor  (when I say good I mean
         it can edit and search in hex).  So let's get started.

              First, we  load  PERISCOPE (PS from now  on).   This  is
         gonna be the  debugger  we use.  Next, we need a quick way in
         to the debugger.  Since ESCAPE FROM HELL (EFH from now on) is
         not all the picky about how it  keeps  a  crackest out, PSKEY
         will do just fine but not without using a little trick.

              Normally, when using PSKEY (for those of  you who do not
         know what PSKEY does, it allows up to break in to PS usings a
         TSR hotkey) and  you  hit  the  hotkey,  PSKEY does an INT 2h
         (NMI).  This then brings up PS  and  you  are  set.  But, EFH
         revectors INT 2h (NMI) to simply an IRET so this  method does
         not work.  How  do  we  get  around this, well, INT 2h is the
         default used with PSKEY but not the only way to work it.  You
         can also use  INT  3h  (Breakpoint   interrupt)  or  INT  15h
         (Extended services interrrupt) to activate PS.   In this case
         we will use  INT  3h;  so  when  we  invoke  PSKEY we add the
         command line parameter "3" (ie:  "PSKEY  3CAL"  invokes PSKEY
         using INT 3h setting the hotkey to CTRL-ALT-LEFT_SHIFT).

              So, now that we have a way in to EFH, where  do  we want
         to break out.   Well  boys  (and Girls, and BTW: if there are
         any Fems reading this, give me  a ring, I'd like to hear from
         ya) I don't have any formula to give, but remember, I suggest
         that we try  to  break  in  to  the  outermost   loop.    So,
         experiance (and a  good  fucking guess) tells me to break out
         in the title screen before the music begins.

              It just so happens that this time I was right (And noone
         had to get nail to anything -D.A.)   Right  after  the  title
         picture comes up, press your hotkey (oooh).  The PS debugging
         screen should come up and you should see the  follow  section
         of code..

         2309:019C CF            IRET
         2309:019D 3D0085        CMP AX,8500
         etc.

              This is  the exit code from PSKEY.  By usings the J(ump)
         command, and executing the IRET,  you  will be put back right
         to the spot  where  you pressed the hotkey (boy  I'm  getting
         excited).  I would love to give you a code fragment here, but
         each time you press the hotkey you will end up at a different
         point.

              So what  do we do next.  Well, we will just have to keep
         executing code until we find some  reference point.  Remember
         how I said we wanted to break out before we reached  to music
         at the title  screen.   Well,  you can bet that we are in the
         outermost loop since the music comes before the doc check and
         we haven't reached the call to  the music routine yet.  So we
         start executing code.

              Then all  of  the  sudden  BOOM!  you  execute   a  CALL
         instruction and music  bursts  through  the  speaker.  AHa, a
         reference point.  We know we are on the right track.

              Press <ESC> during the music  so  that  we  can skip the
         stupid intro for now.  After pressing <ESC> you should regain
         control at the  instruction  after  the  call  to  the  music
         routine.

              From here  on  out,  we  want  to procede rather slowly.
         Each time you reach a CALL instruction you want to write down
         the address where it is located.   Sooner  or  later you will
         execute a CALL instruction and EFH will jump  in  to it's doc
         check routine.  But  damn,  you  have the address of the that
         call WRITTEN DOWN  right.   So   simply   reboot  and  reload
         everything.

              Break out   in  to  PS  at  the  title  picture.    Now,
         unassemble the address   you  wrote  down.   You  should  see
         something like this

         21DD:3EA4 9AA5368132     CALL 3281:36A5  (current line)
         21DD:3EA4 9A522F8132     CALL 3281:2F52
         21DD:3EA4 C706BB070000   MOV WORD PTR [07BB],0000
         21DD:3EA4 8BE5           MOV SP,BP
         21DD:3EA4 5D             POP BP
         21DD:3EA4 CB             RETF

              The first call, is the call  to the doc check, therefore
         it can for  now  be assumed that the second call  is  to  the
         actual game (remember,    most    programmers   follow   good
         programming practice and will exit  the routine that does the
         doc check to  finish the game).  Please NOTE,  from  here  on
         out, if I  say  go back to STEP 1, reboot the machine, reload
         and get to this point.  Ok.

              Our first though in seeing  code like this is shit maybe
         they just check the keyword and exit to dos if  it's bad;  if
         it it's good,  then  they just exit that subroutine and start
         the game.  So having lots of time  on  our hands, we try just
         executing the second CALL and bypass the first  (you  can  do
         that by setting  the IP (instruction pointer) register to the
         offset of the second call [In  our  case 3EA9]).  When you do
         this, the screen clears, and you see the character  (Richard)
         on the screen.   But just as you think it worked, it switches
         back to text mode and prints the message "Hell is HOT".  Shit
         I hate it when that happens.

              So now we know that somewhere  in the doc check routine,
         EFH sets a  flag in memory.  We must figure  out  where  this
         flag is and  figure out a way to fake it.  So go back to step
         1, this time, let's trace (using the T command) in to the doc
         check routine.

              I have included the entire  outerloop  of  the doc check
         routine here.  The   small  subroutines  are   not   of   any
         importants and infact  when I first crack EFH, I never traced
         in to any of them.  It wasn't  until  I  was out getting this
         information that I took a look to see what they did.

              Here is  the  dos check code.  I have place  some  basic
         instructions that should  help you as you go along.  Although
         you address might be different than mine, I will use mine for
         reference.  Also, I have noted some special subroutines along
         the way.

         ( - Unassembled DOC CHECK for ESCAPE FROM HELL [outer loop] )

              First, we start off with  some  initialization routines.
         You don't need to be all to concerned with them.

              This is the last point of interest.  The next
         instruction is where we set the key (by moving FFFFh to the
         memory location DS:0744h).  This is what we need to fake to
         allow the system to run.  컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴커

         3281:39C0 CB            RETF

              Ok, we have now finished the doc check, and control has
         returned (when the RETF instruction was executed) to
         21DD:3EA9.  We are now ready to continue with the game.


              Notice the instruction at 3281:39AD.  This  is where EFH
         sets that external  flag.   But  how  did  I  determine this.
         Well, by luck.  If you look through  the  entire routine, you
         will not find any other instructions placing  a  value in the
         data segment (DS).   And since I decided a long time ago that
         EFH was written in a higher level  language,  we  can  assume
         that it is writting to some variable.

              So, hoping that we have found the flag,  we  go  back to
         step 1.  This  time,  we manualy edit the word at DS:0744 and
         place the value FFFFh there.  We  then skip over the call the
         the doc check  and execute the game.  Then before  our  eyes,
         shit happenes.  The  game  comes  up, and everything is fine.
         By George you've got it.

              So how do we fix the program to always return a good doc
         check.  Well, we could go about it 2 ways.  The first, is you
         could simple modify the instruction at 3281:3935 to perform a
         long jump to 3281:39AD.  This  would  force  set the value no
         matter what was  typed.  But who the fuck wants  to  have  to
         type anything.  I sure don't so lets think of another way.

              If we  look at the entire doc check routine, we will see
         that it does nothing but handle  the doc check (remember when
         we first bypassed  the  check.   The  screen   came   up  and
         everything looked fine  until  it dropped you out.  So we can
         assume that the actual screen is  not setup in doc check.  So
         I suggest placing a small patch right in the begining  of the
         doc check.

              But what  should  this  patch  do? (BTW: it's late and I
         don't know If I'm using ?s right.   So  if  not  TOO  FUCKING
         BAD).  Well, all  it should do is place the  value  FFFFh  at
         DS:0744h.  Here is the assembly language routine to do it.

                        50       PUSH AX
                        B8FFFF   MOV AX,FFFF
                        3E       DS:
                        A34407   MOV WORD PTR [0744],AX
                        58       POP AX
                        CB       RETF

              This small  routine will place the value FFFFh at DS:744
         and then exit back to the main  loop.   Simple huh (note, you
         don't really need the save AX or load AX with  FFFFh for that
         matter but I did it for clarity).

              So now  that we have the patch, and now where to put it,
         how do we get it there.  Well,  thats  where  the file editor
         comes in, but  first  you  will  need  2  things.    The  hex
         equivlent of out   patch   (in  this  case  the  10  bytes  :
         50,B8,FF,FF,3E,A3,44,07,58,CB) and some string to search for.
         I suggest usings the first 14  bytes  of  the routines we are
         going to write  over (the code at address 3281:36A5).   Those
         bytes are 55, 8B, EC, 83, EC ,2A ,C7, 46, DE ,00 ,00, B8, 06,
         and 00.  When   selecting  the  search  string,  select  only
         instructions that ARN'T call,  jump,  loop or any instruction
         that has a memory address in them.  This value  will  NOT  be
         the same when you do the search.

              Now, using for file editor (I used PCTOOLS, but NORTON's
         will do) search  for  our  string  (55,8B,  etc).  When it is
         found (somewhere near sector 200)  write  down  the sector #.
         Now, go and edit that sector.  Find our search string (55,8B,
         etc) and replace  it  with the patch string (50,B8,FF,  etc).
         Now save the sector.

              Your down.   Try  playing  the game.  It should load up,
         and then go right from the title  page  (or the intro) to the
         game without stopping  at  the doc check.  If  your  doesn't,
         then you fucked  up.   Restart  from  the beginning (NO, this
         file didn't fuck up, and I DON'T MAKE MISTAKES).

              Well, you did it.  You have  now  removed your first doc
         check.  Don't ya feel real good.  With time, you will be able
         to remove any type of doc check.


                                                      -BUCKAROO BANZAI


                     At this time I would just like to say

                          `ALL CRACKING GROUPS SUCK!'
