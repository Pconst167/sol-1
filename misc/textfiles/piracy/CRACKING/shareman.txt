Hi reader!, in this tut I intend to teach u guys how to crack ShareMan 1.6....
I will assume that u already have:                                            
1.SoftIce for win95 (If not , get it+Crack from www.acp.xforce.net).          
2.Good knowledge in Assembler.                                                
3.Strong ambition to CRACK! =)                                                
4.Supporting family (Well, this and all next r just recommended...=))         
5.A chick....                                                                 
                                                                              
       Well, that's it for now....... lets go cracking.....                   
1.Launch your softice and then ur Shareman.                                   
2.goto the registeration dialog box (/Help/Enter ID).                         
3.Well, ok, we`re ready for the mission...                                    
  what to do now?                                                             
  Since this program is 16Bit we`ll set 16 Bit Api's...                       
  Set a breakpoint on the following API's : (with BPX [API])                  
  1.getdlgitemtext.                                                           
  2.GetWindowtext.                                                            
  what next? write ur name/nick in the dialog box,                            
  and a dummy registeration number......                                      
4.Now , press OK button, BOOM! we popped up in Soft Ice window!!!!            
  in the api GETWINDOWTEXT, after seeing this, we wanna delete the            
  unused bp's... type this: bc 00 (the 1st bp we set...),                     
  and press F12 twice (!), to get to the code of Shareman...                  
5.Now, here comes the real cracking job... ;)                                 
 ************************ Theory **************************                   
  in this point, lets say u have a tool that loox for the                     
  [regcode] u entered in the memory? Could this possibly help                 
  us? Could it? Take ur time for thinkin...                                   
  Well! STOP THINKING! =)                                                     
  That`ll help us to find the place where the generated                       
  Registration number is compared with the reg number u entered!!!            
  and ofcourse, the CORRECT reg number.....                                   
 **********************************************************                   
  ok, the tool I mensioned in the theory section isnt exactly                 
  a tool, but a command in Soft Ice...                                        
  Lets type:"S 0 l FFFFFFFF '[regcode]'" (L stands for length...).            
  Now softice will give u the location of the regcode on memory...            
 (Segment:Offset).                                                            
  now, lets do a Break Point on Memory location!                              
  type:"BPM Segment:Offset".                                                  
  press CTRL+D (to make the program continue).                                
  several times until u reach to the following instruction:                   
                                                                              
  PUSH AX                                                                     
  REPZ CMPSB                                                                  
  POP DS                                                                      
  JZ 0C87                                                                     
                                                                              
  YES!!!!!!!! we found the place where the reg numbers r compared!!!! ;)      
  all u have to do now is to type:                                            
  D DI-4                                                                      
  and take the registration number out of there...(Make sure that I`m right,  
  and the correct reg                                                         
  number isnt in SI! in case im wrong... u know what to do..=])               
                                                                              
Well, now I wanna greet the following ppl:
