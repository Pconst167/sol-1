				_CbD_'s Tutorial #2
				      Rummy 500 

Well here is a look a at different way for Cracking VB3 programs
Target: RUMMY 500 (Version 3.8)
Get it Here:Comes with the Tutorial
Tools Needed: Softice v3.xx

	Ok Lets talk about the program first. Well it is ok for a VB3 game and considering it was
	done by  women. ( Not a sexest remark) ;-) anyway this is really a nice game if you like
	the card game rummy, BUT this lady seems to think that she must put nag screens
	everywhere. Hmmm  I hate that so that is what is driving this crack. There are nags 
	at the end of every hand (with a 10sec delay) and this is just not fair to us who wish
	to evaluate it at its full. ;-). Ok that is enough about the program. 

	Now as always we will be doning this in steps, so lets get started.
	
Step #1 
	Ok we have to find out a little info about the program so we use QuickView
	(See Tut #1 for info on QuickView) to find out a little about our pup here.
	Hmm looks like a VB3 file. Ok well that takes care of that cause we know
	we cant crack VB programs cause they dont use any of the normal fuctions 
	that we set our BreakPoints on right?   WRONG if you have read my tut #1 or
	razzia's VB tut's you will know we can crack VB programs just as if not 
	faster than any other... Ok  Now lets do a little searching to see if we can find out
	any info on the program, so we look in the dir that we installed to and Whats this
	2 files that might be of some use one is Rummy500.faq and the other is Readme.txt
	so lets see whats in them  First the Faq. hmm nothing there that seems to help
	so next the Readme.txt..... Whats this do you see what i see

IMPORTANT NOTE: MeggieSoft Games does not process any registrations between
December 15th and January 15th.  Any registrations received during this
period will be processed after January 15th.  The registration reminder
will not be displayed between December 20th and January 15th.
****************************************************************************

	No way it cant be that simple not with a program that has so many nags
	well lets try anyway. Change you systems date to say January 1 that would
	give us 15 days. Hmm well they are right no 10 sec delays but yup
	there is still a nag screen and we just cant live with this can we ;-)
	but it was nice of them to tell us anyway. So change your date back 
	so we can enter a Reg Number and crack it.

Step #2 
	Ok now we have not found anything that we can really use to help us other
	than knowing that it is a VB3 program so lets get started cracking it
	first lets start the program and wait for that nagging 10sec delay to go by
	and then press register, Damn more screens what is this shit...
	ok press Enter Registration, Hmm Name and number well that is not good
	that means most likely this wont be just some serial number for us to 
	find in softice that was hardcoded in, Not that this will make it any harder
	just take a few more minutes. 

Step #3
	Ok now enter a name i use (CbD! Cracked) Dont use this cause you are
	cracking it not me ;-) . Now enter a Serial number i use (7777777) now
	press enter and see what happens.  Hmm not a good serial number
	well shit we knew that already so press ok. Hmm well we get another shot
	at it with out haveing to start over good i like this. 

Step #4
	Press Ctrl-D and pop into softice ( If you dont have softice you cant do this crack)
	now lets set a BreakPoint on hmemcpy so do this  BPX HMEMCPY  and press
	enter. now we have a Breakpoint that should pop us into SI(SoftIce) when we
	hit enter in the registration screen so now (If you didnt have any other BreakPoints 
	Set  and if you did Clear Them before you go on  you can do a BC * and then press
	enter and reset the HMEMCPY breakpoint so it is your only one) press Ctrl-D 
	and you should land back in the registration srceen

Step #5
	Press enter Boom back to SoftIce we go ok now we are in the HMEMCPY fuction
	we dont want to be here so we press F11 to get back to the fuction that called HMEMCPY
	but wait this little program had 2 boxes remember 1 for the Name 1 for the number
	so this is most likely the Name fuction and this (You can crack it from here but takes forever)
	is not what we want , we want the serial number right. Ok so press F5 and Pop right
	back in SoftIce we go and Yes back to the HMEMCPY function so Press F11 again
	to get out of it. Now we should be looking at something like this

17CF:0B40 CALL      KERNEL!HMEMCPY
17CF:0B45 PUSH     WORD PTR [DI]
17CF:0B47 CALL      KERNEL!LOCALUNLOCK
17CF:0B4C MOV       AX,SI

	Ok the Address's may differ but the code should look the same, Well this dont look to 
	intresting to us right now so lets step in the code a bit with F10 so press F10 
	you see the lines advancing as you press the key, ok well you will see a  few POP's 
	and then LEAVE and RET <---(interesting) we are in a fuction that called HMEMCPY 
	and now we seem the be fixing to return from the one that called this one hmm ok
	lets keep pressing F10 do this about 10 times or so or until you see the code below
	(Note You should Press F10 a total of 14 times after the last F11) there will be a RET
	that will land you at 
0C0D  POP        DS     <------ Should land here
0C0E  POP        BP    <----- Hmm what is this ?
0C0F  RETF       000C   <---- This looks to me like a compare Return cause it loads 2 values then
				Returns most likely to were they are compared 
				( I kow this already cause i traced it down for you )
	Now here is what my window looked like when i steped through 14 times

  EAX=056AOOOB    EBX=000275EA  ECX=00000000   EDX=06700000      ESI=00021B74            
  EDI=00020106    EBP=000062AO  RSP=000062AO   EIP=OOOOOCOE      o d I s Z a P c         
  CS=17CF   DS=2B57   SS=2B57   ES=3387   FS=059F   GS=011B

	Hmm then we should be able to check the values of  DS & BP
	(I already know the one that holds the Good Serial #) 
	So lets do this      ED BP     and press enter    You should see something like 
	the above Data Window . ( Note Make sure you window fairly wide so you can see 
	all the data or scroll down. Now I cant say for sure but everytime i have done this 
	I have gotten a valid Code (I havent looked very deep into the program yet) 
	so i cant give you the exact reason this code is here but i will soon make a key gen
	and give full explanation of the code so look for it soon. Well now if you look you
	will notice that there are a string of numbers divided by a "-" mine is
	3202-266-395  well my code was 202-266-395 This will not werk for you 
	as it is different for every computer even if The names are the same (Note
	Do Not use Specail charactors in the name ie _ [ / ] - + < > use only numbers
	or letters) so look to see what yours is. you may or may not have 4 numbers
	in the first part of the string if you do ignore the first number as it is not part of the 
	code, if you notice the same number appears just before the string so drop that one
	off and one use xxx-xxx-xxx well that should do it just clear your breakpoints(BC *) 
	and return to the program (Ctrl-D) and then enter you Code and Boom there you are
	no more nag srceens..  But please Do register as the Author done a good job one
	this one even if they did put so many nags in it and the Fee is only $12 like that is 
	to much.......   


	Well hope This helped you some and helped you to understand a little
	more about VB programs. and if not atleast  you got a cool game, without nags
	(unless you still cant carck it ) and even then you know how to get rid of the 	
	10 sec delays     CHANGE THE DATE... duhhhh ok well thats all for this one

		Oh yeah i almost forgot you can change the back of the cards to
		what ever you wish by editing the rummy500.bmp file in a 
		editor such as PaintBrush (Comes with windows). Just though 
		you might want to know that.   Mine say Cracked by CbD ;-)
