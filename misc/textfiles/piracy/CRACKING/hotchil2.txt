Hot Chilli V2.0
comment - Hot Chilli is a very nice Java proggie (very user friendly)
          that I cracked cuz some dude in #cracking4newbies (Efnet)
          Asked acrack for it...
          It's kinda old, and I`m sure some1 else cracked it already and
          released it... but, no1 ever wrote a tut on it! (That's for sure)
          and I decided to write tut on this VERY simple crack for all
          u newbies out there............;)

Key     :1765-7654-8765

After entering the key, just restart the program, and it's regged! ;)

Now, How did I do it??? ;) (Sorry if its not clear enough...)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

u do as following:
1.Bpx Hmemcpy (in softice ofcourse!);
2.press OK on the reg dialog box....
3.Press F12 untill u get to the Hotchilli code (until u`re no longer in the
  user32 code...)
4.when u're in the hotchilli code, press F10 until u get to this instruction:
  mov  (Register),(something)
  mov  (register),(something)  
  Call (some address here...)
  JNZ  (Some address here...)
5.Now before the call is committed, just look at the registers Values...
  (with D (REGISTER)) then, u`ll see the code waiting for ya! :)
