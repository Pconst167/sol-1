The following protection removal schemes took  many valuable hours of time to
create.  This file contains the procedures for  many of the  latest  software
packages  out  today.   (This  document  is updated at every new unprotection
scheme  or  schemes  we  find.)   Please  be patient if your program can't be
cracked yet.  It will be, pretty soon, we hope.

A NOTE ON COPY PROTECTION

At the CopyCats, we would like to make a statement on copy protection. We see
this  concept  as  unnecessary.  Crude disk checking and trudging through the
manuals for "key words," make it very difficult for many of the novice users,
as well as the experienced computer users.  Many  of  our  "program  hackers"
also feel  they do not promote software  piracy.  They  only  help the people
who  are  against  the  protection  schemes and use of software authorization
procedures.  And, if it continues, WE will continue.

                                               "S. W. Unprotected"

LAST MINUTE HACKER'S NOTES

The  PaperBoy  here.  You may notice that many of these programs have similar
protection  scheme  instruction  codes.   If  you  have a program that has no
unprotection  scheme  here,  apply it to the program and test it.  That's how
we were able to pull most schemes down. Remember, this is for the experienced
user.  Don't mess up your originals, either.  And, use write-protect tabs for
the  scheme  checking  -  last  time,  it  erased itself due to a backfire of
the BIOS interrupt 13hex.  Smart program, but WE cracked it.  CAREFUL!
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          THE UNPROTECTION SCHEMES!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. MOST MAJOR ACCOLADE SOFTWARE, The PaperBoy

To remove the protection schemes of 4TH & INCHES, TEST DRIVE, FAST BREAK**, &
other ACCOLADE SOFTWARE:

    Search for these bytes: 55 56 57 06 1E  (use Norton Utilities, DEBUG
       And replace it with: 31 C0 C3 06 1E    PC-Tools, or equivalent)

 ** If you wish to patch FAST BREAK, you must modify all main FB-?.EXE files
    and the FB.RTL file.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. GRAND PRIX CIRCUIT BY ACCOLADE, Two Guys
 
The  previous  ACCOLADE  unprotection  scheme was incompatible with its later
released game, GRAND PRIX CIRCUIT.  With an updated protection, you must:

          Search for these bytes   ------>   And replace it with
         1. BE 06 00 E8 13 00                EB 16 00 EB 13 00

3. LEISURE SUIT LARRY II BY SIERRA, Pirates-R-Us

LEISURE SUIT LARRY GOES LOOKING FOR LOVE  IN SEVERAL WRONG PLACES  by  Sierra
On-Line  has  a  seriously annoying protection scheme. The player must trudge
through  the  manual  to  look for  girl's phone number in order to enter the
game.  This  patch force the program to accept any input at the prompt in the
initialization of the program.

   1. Rename SIERRA.EXE to SIERRA.XXX

   3. Rename SIERRA.XXX back to SIERRA.EXE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. STAR TREK: THE KOBAYASHI ALTERNATIVE BY SIMON & SCHUSTER, Dr. Disk

This  simple  protection scheme can be bypassed with Central Point Software's
NOKEY (distributed with COPY II-PC), or you can use the removal scheme below.

         Search through ST.EXE for CD 13 and replace it with 90 90.

You  can  use this patch with most software that you use with NOKEY to bypass
its protection scheme.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. RAMPAGE AND THE LAST NINJA BY ACTIVISION, INC., The Ninjutsu

The above unprotection scheme can be used on these two ACTIVISION programs.
Search the main EXE files for CD 13 and replace it with 90 90.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. MANHUNTER: NEW YORK BY SIERRA, Bart Montgomery

            Search the file MHVOL.1 for these bytes: 41 06 7A
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                                     and replace them with these bytes: 7F C3 00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. FIX FOR BRUCE LEE BY DATASOFT, The PaperBoy (FOR DISK VERSION ONLY)

     First, Bruce Lee is an excellent product.  It's just that (aaarrrggghhh)
you have no  `falls' left, and you feel yourself quite near the finish of the
game. Suddenly, one of those little dots floating on floor taps your foot and
you get zapped.  You see the sign "Game Over" and you feel pretty pissed, and
wish  you  could open the drive and rip the disk to shreds, but that would be
a waste.  So, fix it! One thing you could do is play option C, one player vs.
your opponent played by the other player. But this time, play alone, and make
sure  the  second joystick is calibrated wrong. If the computer sees that the
Yamo  isn't  moving,  it  will take over, so a wrong calibration will make it
move always.  So, you're playing, but that stupid ninja is in your way and it
won't  let you win.  Alternative?  Eliminate him.  And this is how you do it.
Get  a  disk  utility,  preferably Norton Utilities.  Zap the Bruce Lee disk,
with the following information.

     Sector 271                             Sector 271
     Offset 139                     and     Offset 354
     Change 09(hex) to 63(hex)              Change 09(hex) to 63(hex)
     
     That's all there  is  to it.  Now you play, the Green Yamo flying around
crazily, and the ninja... hmm... the ninja seems to appear for a quick second
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   then disappear.  Now, he's never gonna touch you!

13. CALIFORNIA GAMES BY EPYX, Jonathan Millhouse

To override the disk protection scheme in CALIFORNIA GAMES, enter Norton
Utilities or your favorite disk/file editor and open CALGAMES.EXE.

                Search for these bytes: FA FC 55 56 57
       And replace it with these bytes: 00 00 31 C0 C3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   14. CHUCK YEAGER'S ADVANCED FLIGHT TRAINER BY ELECTRONIC ARTS, Tony Elliott

(Version 1.2 only)

          1.  Rename AFT.EXE to AFT.XXX
          2.  Enter DEBUG with AFT.XXX open for editing.
          3.  At the DEBUG "-" prompt, type

              U 0DBB <ENTER>

Several  lines  with  be displayed on screen. You are interested in the first
two.  They should look EXACTLY like this:

              xxxx:0DBB  E9A3A7         JMP   B561
              xxxx:0DBE  C3             RET

The "xxxx" represents any four  hexadecimal  numbers.   If  you have a match,
on  to  the next step.  If not, you probably have the wrong version.  Sorry!

          4.  At the "-" prompt again, type

              U 0E38 <RETURN>

Several lines of code will again be displayed on screen.  Look  at  the first
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   two following  the "U 0E38" command.  They should also match exactly with the
following:

              xxxx:0E38  880E5005       MOV  [0550],CL
              xxxx:0Exx  8A0E4D05       MOV  CL,[054d]

If you have a match here, then you should  have  a  compatible version of the
AFS program.  If not, sorry!

          5.  At the "-" prompt, type the following:

              E 0DBB 90 90 90 <ENTER>
              E 0E38 C3 90 90 90 <ENTER>
              W <ENTER>
              Q <ENTER>

You should now be back in DOS.  Only one more step left.

          6.  Rename AFT.XXX back to AFT.EXE

That's it!  You now have an unprotected copy of AFT.

16. THE PRINT SHOP BY BR0DERBUND, Swamp Fox

The Print Shop employs two sections of code to copy protect itself. The first
is embedded in PS.EXE and is exercised when the program is run from a floppy.
The second is  embedded in PSINIT.OVR and is employed when the program is run
from a hard or ram disk. Once activated,  both seek out a specially formatted

Both sections of code will be un-hooked here so that the program will run
from either a floppy or a hard disk.

any checking or diskette access at all.

17. THE ANCIENT ART OF WAR BY BR0DERBUND, Didley Bop

Load  up  Norton Utilities with WAS.EXE and search for these bytes: E8 F8 32.
Replace them with B8 01 00.  Now, it's unprotected!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. FIX FOR BATTLETECH BY INFOCOM, The PaperBoy

                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   You don't have enough C-Bills?  Well, this will help.  Save your game and run
Norton  Utilities  or  such with the GAME# (#=number of the save game) ready.
Edit the bytes at offset 05D5hex and 05D6hex and replace it with 00 70.  That
should give you about 28672 C-Bills when you return to the game.  You may  go
as  high  as  FF 7F, which will total 32767, but I wouldn't want to go higher
than that, or there could be a program interpretation screwup.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. FIX FOR TECHNOCOP BY US GOLD AND EPYX, Shimba

If you start with only 5 lives and must go through 11 levels of harsh battle,
I  don't  think  you'll  make it, unless you are lucky and fast enough to get
extra  lives.  Save your game, enter NU and change the byte at offset 5hex to
05.  This will return you to 5 lives.  I tried fixing it with FF, but I found
out that it doesn't work - I lose as if I had no lives left.  You can attempt
to screw around with other bytes and hopefully get more lives than five.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. WILLOW BY MINDSCAPE/CINEMAWARE, Hacker Joe

Open WILLOW.EXE with your hex file editor and perform these operations:

           Search for these bytes:  ---->  And replace with:
           CD 13 59                        90 90 59
           74 02 EB E6                     EB 02 EB E6
           75 04 3C 00                     EB 18 3C 00
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                              3C F8 75 14                     3C F8 EB 14

21. BOP 'N WRESTLE BY MINDSCAPE, SlimeMan

Prepare  BOP.EXE for editing with NU or compatible program.  Search for these
bytes: B8 00 19 CD and replace them with: 31 C0 EB 2F.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. FIX FOR THE LAST NINJA BY ACTIVISION, The Ninjutsu

Not enough lives?  Well,  save your game and enter your hex-style editor with
that save game file open for editing.  Change the byte at offset 59hex to any
hex number  from 00 to FF.  FF will obviously give you 255 lives, so why want
the 00?  Your  screen  will  be lined up with those damn apples on the bottom
status screen, but they won't effect the game.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. INFILTRATOR BY MINDSCAPE, MasterByte

This unprotection scheme was very similar to that of  BOP 'N WRESTLE.  Here's
its own version.  ** Make sure you change all EXE files (except INSTALL)! **

                Search for these bytes: 31 C0 19 CD
                   And replace it with: EB 33 19 CD

To unprotect APOLLO 18, use Norton Utilities or PC-Tools and...

                Search for these bytes: 9A 29 00
                   And replace it with: EB 1B 00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. DEFENDER OF THE CROWN BY MINDSCAPE/CINEMAWARE, The Doctor of MASH

To unprotect DEFENDER OF THE CROWN,  use DEBUG for this one.  Rename the file
DOC.EXE to DOC.XXX and follow the instructions below.

DEBUG DOC.XXX <CR>
-S 0 FFFF B8 00 A0 50 FF 36 0A 45 <CR> ; search for beginning of routine.
xxxx:3BCC                              ; addresses may be different
xxxx:3BF2
-A3BCC <CR>                            ; assemble at first address
xxxx:3BCC JMP 3BF2 <CR>                ; jump to second address
xxxx:3BCE <CR>
-W <CR>                                ; write the edited file back to disk
Writing 11600 bytes
-Q <CR>                                ; quit, return to DOS

Now, rename DOC.XXX back to DOC.EXE.  It's unprotected.
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. PERFECT COLLEGE, Dr. Disk

This  unprotection  scheme is very similar to that of unprotection scheme #1,
the  ACCOLADE  schemes.  However,  the  program  places  a  RETF (far return)
instruction instead of the normal RET.  So, ready COLLEGE.EXE for edit, and:

        Search for these bytes: 55 56 57 06 1E
           And replace it with: 31 C0 CB 06 1E
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. POLICE QUEST II: THE VENGEANCE BY SIERRA, Pirates-R-Us

The new line of SIERRA software protected with the documentational check have
almost identical patches to the main EXE file.  This one was no sweat.

29. THE GAMES: WINTER EDITION BY EPYX, Super Dave

To unprotect THE GAMES: WINTER EDITION, follow these steps below:

    1. Rename GAMES.EXE to GAMES.XXX.
    2. Enter DEBUG with GAMES.XXX ready for modifications.
                    Come on...  Ain't Got All Day!!                                                       3. Type "S 0000 FFFF 0B C0 74 01" to search for the protection pattern.
    4. The  computer should respond with only one address.  If none or more
       than one is given, this unprotection scheme may not work.  Sorry!
    5. Take the address given (in the form of XXXX:YYYY) and subract 5 from
       the  YYYY  address.  The numbers are in hexidecimal.  Do not attempt
       this patch if you do not understand hex.
    6. Use the subracted number (ZZZZ) and enter it in DEBUG as follows:
       "E ZZZZ EB 03 90 90 90 31 C0" to NOP the protection scheme.
    7. Save the modified file by entering "W", then entering "Q" to exit to
       DOS.
    8. Rename the file GAMES.XXX back to GAMES.EXE.
