ABOUT THE GAME:

    Travel around town

        The Truck stop - (1) Catch a bus - good way to get to the next town
                         (2) Listen for rumors - there arent more than 3 total
                         (3) Get Batteries charged - after arena combat or trips
                         (4) Get a room - best way to pass time 
                         (5) Buy Body Armor - Gives you 6 hp - YOU NEED IT!

        Assembly line  - Bulid your cars here but be careful not to exceed
                         the max. weight - see end for charts.

        Salvage Yard   - Sell a car,sell weapons, sell salavage - you never get
                         a good price for anything but salvage...

        Weapon Shop    - When you buy weapons here you have to buy the ammo
                         here seperately - ammo capacity for all stuff is 20

        The Garage     - (1) Recharge your power supply  - same as in T. Stop
                         (2) Repair your active car - You get a list of 
                             damaged items and repair costs.
                         (3) Store your car - you have to pay 50$ to get it out
                         (4) Take a car out of storage - figure it out 
                         (5) Take Mechanic lessons - they last 5 days each

        The Arena      - Practice by yourself - a useless waste of time,$,& ammo
                         Get a schedule of events - this what you wanna do.
                          First you should compete in Amateur night since they
                          give you a car to compete with. Division 5 is for cars
                          worth less than 5000$, 10 = 10000-$...etc.

        The AADA       - (1) Road Information - Degree out outlaws on a road
                         (2) Courier Tasks - Three missions involving deliveries
                             of stuff to other cities - if you qualify this is 
                             a good way to earn money and prestige if you can
                             get them there on time (Max. 3 tasks at once)

        Gold Cross     - (1) Create a clone - its easier to just copy your 
                             DRIVERS file to another dir and then copy it back
                             when you die.
                         (2) Update a Braintape - update your clones personality
                             stats,prestige...etc..
                         (3) Undergo treatment - 100$ and a week for each point

        Joe's Bar      - (1) Buy a drink - Better chance to pick up rumors.
                         (2) Try to sell courier tasks - you get about half 
                             their value and it drops your prestige buy 1 or 2.
                         (3) Listen for rumors

        The FBI        - You'll probably just have to deliver a courier task or
                         two here.

        Origin Systems - In Manchester - previews of new Origins system stuff.

        The Pet Store  - Probably just deliver stuff here once in a while.

        The Casino     - Atlantic City - The most important stop for new drivers
                         (1) Draw Poker - the best 
                          One Pair> 1:1    Two Pair> 2:1   3 of a Kind> 3:1
                          Straight> 4:1       Flush> 5:1    Full House> 7:1
                          4 of a Kind> 25:1            Straight Flush> 70:1
                         (2) Blackjack - hard
                          You win you get 2:1 - a natural 21 is 3:1

        The City Gates - When you've done evrything you can in one town, you 
                         will want to hit the road and want to see another. 
                         Each city will have at least one route leading away -
                         most will have 2+. The roadmap shows how the cities
                         are connected. If you go through the gates, the towns
                         screen will dissapear and you will find yourself on the
                         road! See automap.gif. When you get to your destination
                         you will see its stone gates. Just drive between them,
                         and you will shortly find yourself in the new city.    

        
OUTLAWS  
   They often travel in groups and are very well equipped. The best I can tell 
   is that the purpose of the game is to find one called Mr. Big.

HINTS
  Ok the first thing you should do is go to Atlantic City by bus and then save  
  the game. Copy the file "DRIVERS" to a dir like c:\save and then start the   
  game over. Go to the casino and bet all your money on poker(always bet all 
  your money). If you win then quit and copy the drivers file to c:\save - if 
  you lose then then copy your c:\save\drivers file to your current dir and
  start over - this is a lot easier if you make two little batch files called
  Save.bat and Restore.bat. Well once you have about 899000$ leave the casino 
  (if you go over 899999 the IRS taxes you for 350000). Go to the garage and 
  take mechanic classes until your skill is 99. Then go back to New York and
  compete in amatuer night once or twice to get a feel for the arena. Then 
  make your car and get busy. - Also it'll save you a lot of time and re-playing
  if you quit and run your save.bat file anytime your prestige goes up or you
  accomplish something....also after you leave the casino buy some body armor
  at the truck stop.

Check out Automap.GIf....I included Vgif for you ega/vga people...if you have
CGA or MONO you'll have to pick up a copy of GREYGIF.ARC or just GREY.ARC in
order to view it. Well here are the car-building charts - Have Phun!
