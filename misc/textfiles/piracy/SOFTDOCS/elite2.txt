This is a list of what keys do what.  I have gathered this from playing the
game so some might do more then I know of.  This game is AWSOME!  Can't 
wait till it comes out in english.

The easiest way to get arround, I have found, is to use your autopilot.  Some
scenarios don't give you an autopilot, so I sell my gun and get one, as it
really speeds things up.

Also, if you hit escape twice, then in the first row of options, select the
second to last one instead of the last one, it will lower the display detail
and make the animations MUCH smoother.  Also, clicking on the option
that has the word elite in it makes the flight more realistic.  Give it a 
try.

If you find anything else I have missed, add it and rerelease these docs.
Use the filename format of EL2DOCR?.ZIP if you would.  Replace the ? with
the release number.  Just add one to the latest one you have seen.  Enjoy!
