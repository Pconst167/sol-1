			TECHNICAL DATA
			==============

STARTING THE GAME:

- ATARI, AMIGA: Insert the game disk in the drive and turn
		on your computer.

- PC: At the MS-DOS prompt, insert disk A in drive A and type
      STORM.

PC USERS:

- HARD DISK INSTALLATION:
Create a sub-directory and copy all the files from lhe game disk(s) inside 
this sub-directory. When starting the game from your hard disk, leave disk A 
in drive A. The program must check the protection on your original disk.

- SPECIFIC PC TROUBLESHOOTING:

* The program stops while loading: Your MS-DOS installs some memory resident
  utilities. These TSR programs may take too much memory space.

* The program stops while playing digitised PCM sounds: Type STORM S
  instead of STORM to start the game. This cancels the PCM sounds
  playback.

* Joystick problems: Type STORM J instead of STORM to start the game.

* Mouse problems: Type STORM M instead of STORM to start the game.

IF YOUR ATARI HAS A SINGLE-SIDED DRIVE:
---------------------------------------
Please send the double-sided disk by mail, we will return two single-sided 
disks.

TO QUIT THE GAME: Press Control X.

TO PAUSE THE GAME: Press ESC.


COMMANDS:
=========
You control the game with the mouse. Usually, the left button is used to 
select and confirm an option. The right button has two functions: it is used 
to cancel a selected option or to read information about a place (point 
selected on the map).

If you use the KEYBOARD, you move with the numeric pad (numbers 1 to 9).
To move by blocks, press Control + (number). The RETURN and SHIFT keys 
replaces the left mouse button (select and confirm) and the SPACE BAR acts 
like the right button (Cancel or Infos).

If you use the JOYSTICK, move naturally in the eight possible directions. 
Select and confirm options with the fire button. To get Infos or Cancel an 
option, press the Space bar.


			INTRODUCTION
 			============

Eolia and Sharkaania are twin islands, located on Urgaa, a strange planet 
where the winds are the masters of natural harmony.

Dynasties from both islands have been fighting merciless since the mists 
of times. The reason of this neverending battle has been forgotten long 
ago...

Once again, the Grand Magister of Eolia has been murdered by Sharkaanians 
mercenaries.

You have been appointed by the Council of Seven, formed by the seven main 
governors of the country, to carry on his task. The destiny and the 
treasure of a wasted kingdom lies in the palm of your hands...YOUR GOAL is 
to loot and destroy the seven enemy cities, causing the fall of 
Sharkaania. Beware, they are trying lo destroy you too!!


			GENERAL NOTIONS
			===============

Eolia and Sharkaania are about 5000 km2 in size, and each island is the 
home of 50,000 citizens. Both islands are crossed by windy currents, and 
their strength depends on the current season. They are always different 
for each new game you play.

You start the game with a limited amount of money, expressed in Kaa (the 
local currency).

Use your treasure wisely.

Time is essential through the game: each confirmed action lasts a certain 
amount of time, while your opponent has the same time lo progress. You 
will have to be faster than him to win the game and destroy him.

Spend your treasure carefully. You can loose cities with local anarchies, 
and your men can die from starvation.

Crossing the channel between both islands would be easy, but is impossible. 
It is the home of Goorza, a starving and dangerous sea monster.

  the opponent will attack the strategic sites located on your coasts.
- The looting of a city.


			THE ADVISOR
			===========
(General Statement)

For a small fee, the Counsellor will give you all the information you 
need about your kingdom.


			THE MASTER MILLER
			=================
(Production Control)

This screen displays the kingdom map and the management
icons.

USING THE MAP (lop left icons)
------------------------------
You can scroll the map up or down by pressing the arrow
keys. The two rectangles display the top or the bottom part of
the map. The winds discovered by the Ecclesiast are displayed
in the circle next to the arrows (see next page). To get
information about a place, click
anywhere on the map with the right mouse button.

MANAGEMENT ICONS (from left to right)
-------------------------------------
Each icon represents a certain type of production. Click anywhere on the 
map (right button to cancel) to start this production. The cost is 
displayed at the bottom of each icon.

ICON 1: Wheat Culture.
----------------------
This type of culture requires a very fertile land, screened from winds. 
Wheat grows better in plains.

WARNING: As time goes by, the cultivated land gets poorer, and your yield 
         gets down to almost nothing. You have to move to another area, or 
         ask the Ecclesiast to magically refertilize the land (see next 
	 page). You will need more food as your population grows. Be very 
         careful! A famine can lead you to your fall.

ICON 2: Broomfs Breeding.
-------------------------
These creatures like the sharp mountain landscapes and the high altitudes. 
Their wool is used to weave sails, but their best part is the meat giving 
strength and vitality to workers, while increasing their productivity.

ICON 3: Sqiiz Breeding.
-----------------------
These giants bees create a special honey, raising the intelligence
level of the population. Your men will design more performing products. The 
Sqiiz makes honey from very fragile flowers. You should avoid windy zones.

ICON 4: The Mills. 
------------------
Mills are activated by the winds. They produce all the elements used to
design new flying ships. The type of production depends on the local 
environment:

   - Forest   : The wood is used to build the vessel structures.
   - Mountains: The iron mines produce propellers, shields and engines.
   - Plains   : Sails and balloons are designed in factories.

These products have different values. The intelligence level of the workers 
affects the range of production.

ICON 5: Budget. 
---------------
You can allocate any amount of money to any production site to improve
its productivity. Beyond a certain amount of money, this option is not 
very useful.

WARNING: Your kingdom is not very large, with a few windy zones and a lot 
of various landscapes. Carefully dispatch your industrial production sites 
on the map.


			THE ECCLESIAST
			==============

This screen is similar to the master miller screen and displays the map
of Eoila. The Ecclesiast is also displayed as a small character. You can
give him orders with the icons at the bottom of the map.


ECCLESIAST ICONS (from left to right):
--------------------------------------

ICON 1: Temple Construction. This action costs a lot of money. Temples 
        are used for religious ceremonies.

ICON 2: Movement. To move the Ecclesiast, click on this icon, then on the 
        destination point.

ICON 3: Wind Prediction. The Ecclesiast has the power to predict the winds. 
        If there is a wind around him, it turns into a tornado.

ICON 4: Refertilization. To refertilize land, you must first move the 
        Ecclesiast to the selected area.

ICON 5: Mass & Winds Menu


WIND MENU:
----------
The winds are obtained after a religious ceremony. To use a wind, click on 
one icon, then on the map to point on the area where you want the wind to 
operate. Its power depends on the selected icon.

Wind Icons (from left to right):
--------------------------------

ICON 1: Very light local wind.
ICON 2: Medium wind. Spreads over a quite large area.
ICON 3: Heavy winds through the whole country.
ICON 4: Very powerful tornado.
ICON 5: Deadly raging cyclone. To be sent on the opponent. Once you have 
        scrolled the map, you must reselect the icon then click on the 
        target to destroy. Click on Exit or on the right mouse button to
        cancel.

THE RELIGIOUS CEREMONY:
-----------------------
To perform a religious ceremony, the Ecclesiast must be next to a temple. 
Click on the drawing on the right of the buttons.

This is an incantation devoted to the god Eolu. Depending on the 
spirituality level reached at the end of the ceremony, you will gain a 
wind you can use as described previously. This value is graphically
measured by a will-o-the-wisp coming out of a well, and moving up or
down.

At the centre of the screen, you can see the Baarma, the Sacred Book of 
Eolia. The Baarma indicates in which part of the ceremony you currently 
are. Depending on each specific part of the ceremony, you must click on 
certain characters on the screen to confirm or cancel a specific action.

Several actions can be performed simultaneously.


THE BAARMA CHAPTERS: THE CEREMONY
----------------------------------

I. Overture (OTOO): 
-------------------
The ceremony may only begin with the sound of thunder, causing the
will-o-the-wisp to appear.

II The Adoration (SAAVI): 
-------------------------
The Ecclesiast speaks, the faithful grovel before him.

III. The Call (EHOOL): 
----------------------
The various communities sing prayers, imploring Eolil's coming.

IV. The Reading (BLAAB): 
------------------------
The reader declaims litanies in memory of all the deceased Ecclesiasts.

V. The Dance (TOOSE): 
---------------------
Symbol of the cyclone, the Dance is performed by a turning dervish while
the bells are ringing.

VI. The Harmony (KWAAX): 
------------------------
All the different musics melt into a single mystic harmony.

VII. The Sacrifice (GOORZ): 
---------------------------
A young male Broomf is offered up as sacrifice to the sound of rolling
drums.

VIII.The Blessing (NIIBA): 
--------------------------
At the Ecclesiast's order, the crowd, the Baarma Keeper and the
Balance-Monk execute cabalistic passes.

IX. The WindSong (FUUL): 
------------------------
The Chosen Ones (male and female) sing the mysterious ancestral song.

X. The Acclamation (OROO): 
--------------------------
All the members of the ceremony greet Eolli for his endless mercy.



			THE HIGH CONSTABLE
			==================
(Trading)

This screen allows you to use three different options:

STOCK EXCHANGE:
---------------
Click on the auction sale scene on the screen. You can then buy and sell 
any type of product. Select the product on the table. The current prices 
will be displayed on the scroll.

To sell products, click on the characters to the left. To buy products, 
click on the characters to the right. You must then confirm by clicking on 
the auctioneer (the character holding a hammer). Look at the bottom of the 
scroll to know if you are buying or selling products. If the price includes 
a decimal point, the value is always rounded to your disadvantage.

TAXES:
------
Click on the character sitting at the table, in the right bottom part of the 
screen. A special abacus, the Cranool, is displayed on the screen.

Taxes are determined with this precious tool. Small icons allow you to 
confirm or cancel taxes for each city. The income is displayed 
simultaneously. The tax income depends on the comfort level of the city.

To cancel or confirm, use the two bottom buttons. Your tax income will be 
automatically added to your current treasure.

WARNING:

Do not misuse taxes. Some cities, especially those with a low comfort 
level, may rise against you if taxes are too high.


COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS:
----------------------
When you click on the two centre characters which are shaking hands, a 
treaty proposal is displayed on the screen. There are many various 
treaties. They change often. If you agree with the proposal, click on
OK, or cancel with NO.


			THE JOKER
			=========

(Leisure & Entertainment)

Leisure and entertainment are important to the game. Entertaining your 
population is a decisive factor. After all, like us, they want to have 
fun and forget all their problems. You can allocate money to each kind of 
entertainment by clicking on PLUS, MINUS, and OK.


			THE INOUISITOR
			==============
	
(Secret Police)

This screen allows you to choose between four options:

THE EAGLE (left): 
-----------------
The eagle is used to deliver political and military contracts over long
distances.

THE DOVECOT 
-----------
(Background centre): 

For a cheap price, they will give you various informations. The two first 
cages are related to Sharkaania while the six other ones correspond to 
different parts of your kingdom. The coats of arms will give you information
about the current situation in your cities. To EXIT, click on the Exit cage.

THE MAP OF THE WORLD 
---------------------
(Centre, on the ground): 

You can view your opponent's map, including all his buildings and type of 
cultures. It is very useful to prepare military operations.

THE EXECUTIONER 
---------------
(Character on the right side of the screen): 

He will murder one or more enemy ministers. His rates are fairly high, but 
for a long period of time you will be insured that no attack can be 
performed by the ministers he murdered.

WARNING: Prices are always higher after each murder. The Executioners are 
	 homeless, and not always reliable.



			THE LEONAARDO
			=============
(Sciences)

You can choose from five options in this screen.

THE SCIENTIFIC ACADEMIES 
------------------------
(Treasure. bottom left): 

You can allocate money to the different academies in your citics by 
clicking on the PLUS and MINUS buttons. You will raise the comfort level of 
the cities when you allocate money to its academy.

FLYING SHIPS DESIGN 
-------------------
(Drawing-board on the left): 

To select the type of ship you want to design, clicking on one of the four 
ship drawings.

The design process is achieved in three steps:

PHASE 1: SHIP'S EQUIPMENT
-------------------------
Choose the components you want with the icons, then place them on the plan 
using the small crosses on the screen. You can move and delete elements, or 
add several ones of the same type. The numbers displayed on the icons 
indicates the current available component stock. If one element is not 
available (like the ship structure), you cannot build a flying ship.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

- Propellers and engines are heavy, but the ship's speed is increased.
- Sails and balloons lighten the ships, but they reduce speed.
- Shields offer a good protection during battles.

PHASE 2: CREW ASSIGNMENT
-------------------------
Click on the selected character. You can then add soldiers with the left 
mouse button, and remove them with the right mouse button.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

- Your flying ship will not operate correctly without a pilot.
- Captains and cooks are important, since they affect the crew's morale and 
  behaviour and the overall ship performance (speed and combat 
  effectiveness).
- Riflemen and catapult gunners are assigned to the difrerent weapons on 
  board of the flying ship.
- Infantry is exclusively used for looting your opponent's cities.
- Large crews cost a lot of money during campaigns, and increase the 
  weight of the ship.


LAST PHASE: TRIAL FLIGHTS.
--------------------------
This stop is sometimes painful. A complete check-list is displayed on the 
screen, including the ship plans, the crew assignment and the value of 
various performance factors. Speed is essential to the wargame part of 
Storm Master (managed by the Commander). You can modify plans, crew 
assignments, or test the ship in flight with the icons on the right of the
screen. The trial flights are performed in the plains. To know their 
results, you will watch the flight on the screen. You cannot use a ship 
without carrying on a preliminary trial flight.

Vessels crashed during one of them are also unavailable. The check-list is 
displayed once again after the trial flight. To confirm the whole operation, 
click on OK. The plans are automatically saved, and you can later modify the 
ship at anytime. You still will have to test any modified ship in flight.


MASS PRODUCTION
---------------
Once you designed an operational flying ship, you can order mass 
production to raise your army. To do this, click on the ship construction 
scene (top left of the screen), then select the ship.A command sheet with 
all the information about the mass production of this type of
vessel is displayed on the screen. The number of ships you can build 
(according to the number of available elements and soldiers) is displayed 
at the bottom of the scroll. To determine the number of ships you want to 
order, click on the PLUS and MINUS buttons, and confirm with OK. The flying 
vessels are immediately available.

SHIP DESTRUCTION
-----------------
Click on the top right part of the screen to select this option. It is 
sometimes very useful.
For example, if you have raised an army with poor performance (low speed) 
and you have enough ship components in stock to raise a much faster one, 
adding the new army to the old one would give an average performing army as 
a result. It is much more interesting to destroy your old army first, then 
raise a new one. You will have less ships, but your armada will be much 
more efficient. Examine carefully your production, your treasure and your
strategic targets before proceeding.

To destroy a ship, click on the type of vessel, then on the scroll, and use 
the PLUS, MINUS or OK buttons.

WARNING: All the ship's components are destroyed too, but their crews are 
         still available.

SHIPS SUMMARY
--------------
A summary of the four different ship types is displayed when you click on 
the board above the character. This option is very useful when you are 
about to raise an army for your campaign.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:

- IKAAR ships are light and fast. They carry a limited number of men, but 
  are very effective during quick raids.
- SKRUUZ ships are excellent battleships. Like IKAAR ships, they carry a 
  limited number of troops, and are ineffective for looting enemy cities.
- OGLEE ships are equipped with a catapult to protect them from enemy 
  attacks. They can carry a large number of men.
- NOOWE ships are extremely heavy and slow, but you can load a huge army on 
  them.


			THE COMMANDER
			==============

Military operations are decided on the map. To select the operation you want 
to perform, click on one of the five icons.

ICON 1: AIRFIELD CONSTRUCTION. 
------------------------------
The total cost is displayed under the design.
Select the icon and drag the symbol on the map. The airfields are the 
starting point of your army during the war.

ICON 2: KOOLPER CONSTRUCTION.
-----------------------------
Same as airfields. These flak batteries inflict heavy damage to the 
opponent's ships during attacks.

ICON 3: ENLISTMENT. 
-------------------
There are six classes of soldiers: ship captains, pilots, riflemen,
catapult gunners, infantry men and cooks. Click on a class to view the 
character summary screen. Use the PLUS, MINUS and OK buttons to enlist men. 
The soldiers enlisted are added to your current troops, and you can assign 
them to different crews. Click on EXIT on the command panel to leave ths 
menu.

ICON 4: SHIPS ASSIGNMENT (AIRFIELDS)
------------------------------------
Select the type of ship, then drag the symbol to an airfield on the map. 
Unassigned ships are unavailable for army use.

ICON 5: CAMPAIGN.
-----------------
Your goal is to destroy the seven enemy cities. The only way to achieve 
this is to elaborate military campaigns. A campaign is composed by 
different operations.

First, you must regroup your armada. Click on the selected airfield on the 
map. The selected army located on the airfield will be ready to start the 
campaign.

To determine the type and number of flying ships assigned to the campaign, 
click on the numbers displayed to the right of the ship names (on the 
command scroll). The number of men left on the airfield is displayed to 
the left. You also click on this to determine the number of men. Click on 
OK to confirm.

The average speed of your armada, the total amount of soldiers, the 
resistance and the strength of your army are displayed on the screen.

These values are calculated according to the performance factors of each 
ship, and are essential to the next step of the campaign.

You now have to finance the campaign. Use the two arrows on the scroll. The 
Cost is expressed in travel days, depending on the number of soldiers 
assigned to the campaign.

Click on OK to confirm, NO to cancel.

You will not be able to recover the money spent here. If you still travel 
after the number of days has expired, your ships will start to wreck.

The control panel of the flagship is displayed at the bottom of the screen. 
Your ship is displayed on the map.

1. Movements in all directions: The ship stands still on the centre.

2. Landing or looting: Use this option over an enemy city to loot it, or 
   over an airfield to end the campaign.

3. Bombing: A click on the mouse button drops a bomb from the ship. The 
   number of bombs required to destroy an enemy target depends on the 
   resistance level of your opponent. The Inquisitor holds this kind of 
   information. Do not waste bombs on cities.

4. Calendar: The length of the travel days depends on the average speed of 
   your armada. When the number of days is expired the ships in your 
   armada will wreck one by one.

5. Speed: The speed of the armada depends on the winds. The display will 
   move according to this factor.

6. Loot. After looting an enemy city, you will be rewarded. The loot depends 
   on the number of men sent to loot the city. To be destructed, a city 
   must be totally looted. You win the game when all the enemy cities have 
   been looted. The Inquisitor can give you information about the enemy 
   cities. The loot will not be added to your treasure as long as
   your army has not returned safely home.

7. Condition. The current state of the armada and the different ship types 
   are displayed here.

WARNlNG:

Your opponent will shoot at you if you fly near his KOOLPERS (flak), and he 
will send troops to attack your kingdom. If two armadas meet, the 3D 
action combat part of the game is activated.

3D ACTION COMBAT
----------------
The flagship's pilot instruments are displayed in the control panel at the 
bottom of the screen. No matter what type of ships your armada is made of, 
you always are equipped with crossbows and a catapult. The strength of the 
battle depends on the number of men engaged in it, on your own strength 
and on your resistance level. All these information are displayed in The 
check-list of each ship.
