        		  ..oO TONE GENERATOR Oo..

  Ok...first off......your probably wondering....aBD....hmmmm..."another one of
those shitty 416 area groups again. They'll be gone in a week."....well....
here's your answer "Is Madonna a virgin?"..of course not...we'll be here for a
while.....Newayz....here's the deal on the aBD TG.

Files included in abdtg.zip:

aBDTG.NFO      -=this phile=-
aBDTG.EXE      -=the tone generator=-
WORLDBOX.TXT   -=worlwide tones (Hz) for LD phreaks=-
BOXTONES.TXT   -=a few tones (Hz) for the more famous boxes=-
REDBOX.TXT     -=the tones (Hz) for the ever famous red box=-
FILE_ID.DIZ    -=I wonder what this is?....=-

1. How to use the aBD TG.

a) turn your computer on...okokok.
b) watch the neat intro coded by me (GReNDeL)
c) when it comes to the opening screen you have several options:
	
		ABD INFO
	          HELP
	     GENERATE TONES
	       EXIT TO DOS
	    SHELL OUT TO DOS

d) highlight whichever one you want. I highly suggest the HELP option first.
e) you can figure it out from there....

2. Notes on the aBD TG.

  The aRReSTeD BuS DRiVeRS Tone Generator was written in ...ugh... TURING V. 7.8
by:
			Zerohm   Programmer
		       GReNDeL   intro coder

at the time of this release, the formulae for adding Hz was unknown.....so your
gonna have to figure it out yourself till we come out with version 1.3o....

The advantages are that the Tone Generator will never become outdated because 
every aspect is programmable....unfortunately nothing can be done in less than 
5o milliseconds...so quarter ($o.25) tonesare not possible with this edition....
we'll fix it in the next version.....

some strange reason you would like to contact us the above also applies....were
looking for more HQ's/DS, and maybe a few spreaders, and master phreaks.
