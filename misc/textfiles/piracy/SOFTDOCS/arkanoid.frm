Arkanoid II: Revenge of DoH
---------------------------

Cracked by Lord Blix
(Another "impossible" protection scheme beaten to hell by the FiRM)


Hey gang, just droppin in to let you know that Taito changed its protection
scheme... AGAIN.  This one took well over an hour to defeat.  But, you must
give them credit for trying.

UnZIP into any convenient directory and type "ARK2FIRM" to run it.

The Program Attempts to pick out the best config options for you, but
if you want to change them manually, pass these parameters on the
command line.  You only need this done once, the config file will
automatically be updated.
