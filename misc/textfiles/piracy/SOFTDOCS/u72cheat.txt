Note:  The manufacturer has said that they do not support or recommend
       the use of any cheat system with ULTIMA 7.

       Proceed at your own risk.

       [So far I have not had any problems with it.]



Activating the cheat system:
---------------------------

When you run the SERPENT program you must also type a code word following
the program name.

The code word is "PASS" (for a total of four characters).

eg.  SERPENT PASS


A batch file has been provided which already contains the necessary
code word.  Just type  U72CHT  in order to run it.



Cheat system keys:
-----------------

Here are the keys that are available to you when you are walking around.
The ones that have a "??" in the comments column are those that didn't
seem to do much (or anything) when I tried them.

CHEAT KEYS                   Comments
------------------------     ---------------------------------------------
F2    Super Cheat System     Displays cheat mode main menu.
F3    Goto Map Location      Displays map.  Point and click.
F4    Single Step Toggle     ??
F5    Cast Spell             Type spell number. Press ENTER. Point, click.
F6    Barge Hack Cheat       ??
F7    Toggle Traces          ??
F8    Read Sign, Book, Etc.  Press letter.  Type number and press ENTER.
F9    Target Report          ?? Point and click.  Not sure what it does.
F10   Pathfind Test          ??
Alt-1 Sound Effect           Type a number.  Press ENTER.
Alt-2 Frame Counter          ??
Alt-3 Sprite Effects         Type a number.  Press ENTER.  Point & click.
Alt-4 Dump Item Contents     Point at item to dump.  Click.
Alt-6 Play Music             Type a number.  Press ENTER.

Some of these keys (and menu items in the cheat menus) require that you
know a number (ie. an NPC # (non-player character), a spell #, etc.).
One useful option in the cheat menus is the "Numbers" item which will
display the NPC's number next to them on the screen.  This number can
be used whenever you are asked for an NPC number.



Stats and Eggs:
--------------

If you add a space and the letter "S" after the "PASS" characters, then
you can see a Status display while the program is loading.  This includes
memory usage, files being read, etc.

When the program finishes it also displays some memory stats.

Also, when you use the "S" parameter special "Eggs" appear in various
locations.  So far I have seen some that look like eggs,  horseshoes,
and lightning bolts.  All say "Egg" when you click on them.  If you 
pick up a lightning bolt while a cloud is going overhead the cloud
vanishes while you are holding the bolt.  It comes back when the bolt
is dropped.

eg.  SERPENT PASS S

A batch file has been provided which already contains the necessary
code word and the letter "S".  Just type  U72CHTS  in order to run it.



Other parameters:
----------------

The game (SI.EXE) does look for other command line parameters.  Use at your
own risk.  Here some useful ones:

P   Used to run SI.EXE without first running SERPENT.COM
S   Displays load/memory status and "Eggs".
?   Displays version information (ie. type: SI ?)
