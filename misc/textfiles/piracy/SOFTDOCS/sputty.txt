PUTTY - THE GAME

OBJECTIVES


PUTTY MOON
----------
The Bots have been frozen into blocks of ice by Dazzledaze and must be
returned to their flying saucer.

Break the ice using Putty "Punch Power" and then melt beneath the Bot thus
absorbing him. Even though the Bot is safely inside your tummy,he is still
prone to attack from exploding devices and can only take four hits before 
disintergrating.
your ob is to release him safely into his flying saucer,avoiding attack
from enemies along the way.

TIP: Enemies dont attack Bots,they attack you.If you are inder threat from
an enemy release the Bot until you have successfully dealt with the attacker


TOWER OF ZID
------------
During the night the Bots must make their way home from the Tower of Zid.
Unfortunately DazzleDaze has sent his cohert Dweezil the Cat and an army of
nasties down to Zid to harass the Bots and stop the building of the tower.
You must get the Bots safely down the elevator so they can continus their
building process the next day.

Unlike the Bots on Putty Moon, these Bots are very mobile and are
attempting to get to the elevators on their own.If they encounter an enemy
they with attempt to jump and may plunge to their death. Some enemies on
this level attack the Bots as well as Putty.

TIP: Remember,when you release a Bot on this level it will bounce off on its
own course until you recapture it.Try to release them safe platforms where no
nasties are present.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------
It is possible for enemies to accidentaly kill each other,experiment by
bouncing between two of them.

Keep your score soaring by 'bounty hunting' big nasties,this generates
extra lives and may give you a medal.

Machines are deadly,avoid them whenever possible.
