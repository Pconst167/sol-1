Zool: Ninja from the Nth Dimension.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In Zool you play the interstellar cosmos dweller from the Nth 
dimension. You must guide Zool through thousands of screens of
surreal and bizarre action in a bid to bring the intergalactic
Ninja back to the Nth dimension. You must take Zool to the limits
of the Universe, to the outer limits of the known universe, 
through quite a bit of unknown universe, and beyond the fairly well
known but it wouldnt want to walk through it at night on my own 
universe. Before reaching home Zool has to successfully work 
through all manner of bizzarre situations, worlds and enemies.
The only way to do this is by exploring each world until the exit 
is found, and progressing onto the next one. It sounds fairly 
straightforward, sure, but when you add in the enemies, strange 
features and surreal events, this is one journey thats going to 
be, well, weird.

Obliterated by Crystalk so why bother typing the crap ?!?!!?.

The Main Options Screen.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To highlight a particular option simply move the joystick up and
down. To alter an option, move the joystick right at the highlighted
option. To leave the options screen press the fire button.

The options will affect the game in the following way:

LEVEL - The level of difficulty you select will change the number of 
bonuses you will need to collect in order to leave a level and progress
to the next. On Easy you will need 25%, om medium 50% and 75% on the
difficult level. The level of difficulty will also affect how much
time you will have to complete a level.

MUSIC - This option allows you to select either sound effects, or the
tune which will accompany your Zooling, with everything from funk to 
rock on offer.

INERTIA - Does Zool grind to a halt faster than a fly hitting a 
windscreen, or does he gradually slow down before grinding to a 
halt? Its up to you!.

CONTS - How many 'Continue Game' options are given when you lose 
your last life. The maximum is five.

SPEED - Offering a choice of normal or fast, we recommend that you save
the fast level until you have completed the game at normal speed - 
believe us, its fast enough on that level!


Playing Zool
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you are happy with all the options, pressing the fire button will
take you from the options screen to the main screen. From here you
press fire again to begin the game.

All of Zools actions are controlled using the joystick. He's a very
versatile character, but after a couple of tries controlling Zool is
simplicity itself!

Joystick Controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Restart Points.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On each level there are a number of restart points to be found, and if 
they are triggered, the you will begin your next life from the restart
point. They are not easy to spot at first but you will soon be using
them automatically. Each one needs to be punched in order to be triggered.
On each of the levels they are:

SWEET WORLD  : A Sign. Punch them, and the jelly bean will change colour.

FRUIT WORLD  : A half buried banana: The top of the banana will change 
	       when they are punched.

MUSIC WORLD  : A half buried remote control. Punch it and one of the 
               buttons will change colour.

TOY WORLD    : A sign similar to those on sweet world.

FUNFAIR WORLD: Again, a sign.

TOOL WORLD   : A short stumpy piece of wood with a nail sticking out.
               Hitting them will cause the nail to change position.


Bonus Hearts
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Occasionally, when you destroy an enemy, a small heart will appear 
and start to fly skywards. If Zool can grab it, then he will boost his
health.


The Weapons at Zool's Disposal.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Throughout each level, Zool will find weapons that will, if only 
temporarily, assist him in this mission. They take the form of:

BOMB - This smart bomb will destroy any enemy on the screen when 
Zool collects it.

TWOZOOL - This bizarre weapon will split Zool in two, creating a shadow
Zool which will follow the actions of the real Zool. This allows Zool to 
fire twice as many bullets as usual and get around on a much niftier
manner. Will wear off after a short time.

JUMPING ZOOL - Just the thing when Zool needs to scale the heights and
theres no convenient method. Again, this one will wear off after a certain
amount of time has elapsed.

SHIELD - This will give Zool a limited period of invulnerability. Use
these carefully, as they generally are situated close to an area where
they will prove very useful.

TIME BONUS - Just when it seems that Zools goinng to be beaten by the 
clock, one of these little goodies could prove the saviour of the day.

1UP - Will give Zool an extra liife. Very Useful!


OVER 'N' OUT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thats about all you need to know to play Zool, but it isnt everything you
will learn.There are many many things to be discovered, including 
four hidden bonus levels featuring ... well, we will let you find then 
for yourself. Its a voyage of discovery and often you will find that 
everything is not as it seems. Walls that arent walls and speakers that
arent speakers just for starters. So, Dont hang about, the timers already
running down, just get goung and prepare to Ninja your way back to the 
Nth Dimension. GOOD LUCK.


The Bad Guys
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Its not going to be an easy journey for Zool, what with the various 
geographical hazards to be encountered. And thats before you even begin
to think about all the strange enemies to be faced. Of course, if we gave
you details of all the strange creatures you will encounter we would be 
giving too much away. Just to whet your appetite however, here's some of 
the strange menaces you will be mixing with.

SWEET WORLD
------------
BUMBLE BEE - These huge beasties take to the air and then home in on Zool.
Dont leave them for too long though as new ones are generated all the
time, and before you know it, Zool has five or six on his tail.

JELLY - These nasties are everywhere. Fortunately theyre not hard to
destroy and a quick kick, punch, jump or missile will see them off.

DODGY JELLY - Similar to a normal jelly only this one homes in on you.

SWEET BEASTIE - These beasties are fairly rare, which is lucky because
they are the meanest critters you will come across in the sweet world.
These not only get in your way, but will launch a whole load of 
projectiles at you at any given opportunity.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - The Hum-bugger.


THE MUSIC WORLD
---------------
WALKING DRUMS -  Not the easiest enemy to defeat by any stretch of the 
imagination. These guys, as well as being impervious to bullets, actually
bounce them off at an angle, making them more dangerous for Zool.

VIOLINS - Armed with an infinte supply of bows, the violins will follow 
you around and fire their bows at you. Difficult to destroy because 
theyre impossible to get near.

CYMBALS - Whizzing round the screen as they go, bumping into one of these
could give Zool more than just an ear bashing.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - Jimmies Killer Guitar.


THE FRUIT WORLD
---------------
POMEGRANITE VOLCANO - They may look harmless, but when they begin to 
spray pips in every direction at every speed, its time for Zool to head
the other way.

CARROTS - Spitting carrot shrapnel at Zool is just about the nicest thing
these mutants do.

FLYING PEA PODS - Hurtling across the sky at incredible s-pea-ds (sic!), 
these not very stealthy bombers could deal Zool a nasty surprise.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - Banana and alarm clock.


TOOL WORLD
----------
DRILLS - Emerging from walls and then retreating just as fast and 
unexpectedly, Zool can use these to benefit. How ? You'll just have
to find that one out yourself. (Tight bastards eh ? ).

SAWS - Slice and Dice!. Emerging from the ground when you least expect
them, these could catch Zool when least expected.

CHAIN SAW - Hacking through the air as it goes, contact with this
meanie could leave Zool with a SPLITTING headache.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - Giant Driller Killer.


TOY WORLD
---------
TANKS - These armour cald killers fire enormous missiles at Zool.
They are not as indestructible as they look.

BOUNCING BALLS - All colours and all sizes, these rebounding rogues
will cause Zool many an injury.

PAPER AEROPLANES - Created in the school classrooms, these state of the 
origami art bombers can cause some tricky situations.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - Maxie the Robot.


FAIRGROUND WORLD
----------------
TOFFE APPLES - These mutant toffee apples are only too happy to share
their toffee with Zool. The only thing is, its still red hot, and not
exactly digestible. Avoid!.

POPCORN BAGS - More goodies for Zool to savour, but again, its not exactly 
the sort of goodies he would like. This popcorn does more than pop.

HAMMERS - Anyone who needs telling that a blow from one of these is bad for
you deserves hitting. Try not to destroy them, as they will prove useful.
It'll need some figuring out exactly how though.

END OF LEVEL NASTY - The unmentionable, indescribable Two Eyed Thing. No
one who has seen this horror has lived to tell the tale. Will Zool ?.
