  Welcome to the exciting world of Gunbelt 3 (yawn).  Gunbelt is an all-
encompassing tool for the exploration of all functions of your IBM or 
compatible modem.  It is intended to be used in a legal manner.  Any other use 
if hereby forbidden!  (of course, who cares what I say).


FEATURES:

           * New windowing routines to make the whole thing seem much
             more organized.

           * Complete Configuration menu which can be called from anywhere 
             within the program.

           * 100-Entry Extender Dialing Directory which stores all relevant 
             information about a number and also may be called from wherever
             you are.

                INCLUDING:
                             Last Time Called
                             Number of Good Codes
                             Percentage of Good Codes

                             etc...


           * The Modem Irritation Mode finally works!  You can irritate up to 
             twenty of your closest enemies at the same time.

           * Wargames dialer capable of dialing through five different 
             exchanges (976 recommended) with different range sizes.   Output
             may go to screen, disk, printer or any combination.

           * Gunner 3.0 - Now supports four code algorythms while concurrently
             dialing up to 12 of your favorite exchanges.  Each code may use
             a different technique.

           * Full editing supported on the destination numbers file.

           * Coming in Gunbelt 3.1 - An on-line Mini-term program to
             check out Wardialed numbers.

           And Finally...

           * A nice credits page mentioning the names of all the people
             who'd people really upset if I didn't.


  Enough, already.  On with the instructions....



Reconfigure Gunbelt [^T]:
-------------------------
   Select this option the first time you run Gunbelt.  You may either highlight
this from the main menu or merely hit [Ctrl]-[T] from wherever you are.  All
options are pretty well self-explanatory.
   Be sure to set Gunbelt to the proper COM port number with this feature.  You
may find it necessary to exit the program and re-run it after doing this.


Edit Number Directory [^N]:
---------------------------
   Selecting this option will bring up your exchange list.  The following 
options will then work:

                [Enter]         - This will TAG or UNTAG an exchange.  Only
                                  the tagged files will be used by the
                                  code hacker.
                [E]             - Edit the highlighted entry.  You will be
                                  asked for all information about the
                                  exchange at this file.
                [X]             - Return to previous operation.



Wardialer 1.1

                [X]             - Return to main menu.

NOTES: Code Algorythm Modes
---------------------------
   Gunbelt ]I[ supports four methods of producing its codes.

        1] SHORT SEQUENCE - A small number will be added to your starting
           code.  For instance, if you chose a starting code of 321230 and
           a short increment of 3, the resulting codes would be:
           321230, 321233, 321236, 321239, etc..

        2] RANDOM SEQUENCE - A random number will be added to your starting
           code.  You choose the maximum possible jump between 5 and 2000.
           Gunbelt will choose a random number between 1 and that number.

        3] GUNBELT 2.0 - This was the only mode support in older versions of
           this program.  If you are very sure that there are some codes
           hiding out in a certain area, use this.  You choose a "block
           size", for example, 25.  Gunbelt then scrambles all codes in
           a block of 25, starting from your base code.  It then dials these
           in a random order.  No sequencial dialing and you get every code.

        4] SHOT IN THE DARK - You are not asked for any information in this
           mode.  All codes are created using only the code length.  This is
           especially useful if you're looking for a cache of good codes. I've
           had very good luck with this.

  When changing modes, hit [M].  You will be asked for the extender entry
number.  This number is listed to the left of your tagged extender at the top
of the screen.



Modem Irritation Mode
---------------------
  Tired of munchies who have a peaceful night's sleep?  Unable to get out to
blow their house up?  Well put in the phone numbers of up to 20 of your 
favorite peons, turn off the speaker (hit [Ctrl]-[T]), and go to sleep.
Commands are:

                [A]             - Add number to death list.
                [D]             - Delete last entry from list.
                [S]             - Start the fun!
                [X]             - Return to main menu.

------------
   A list of really nice boards and sysops who wanted to be mentioned.


Terminal Mode
-------------
  This isn't used quite yet.  But it will be a term program linked to the
wardialer so you can check out all carriers.


Exit to DOS
-----------
  We're not quite sure how this works yet, but we'll keep you posted.


NOTES OF INTEREST (maybe):
          We will be sending out pre-made lists of destination
        numbers for you to load and use.  Or if you have some good
        ones, send them to one of the boards listed on the credits
        page.
          There is NO picture of Andy Capp on here, Creeping.  Quit
        looking for it.  Well, ok...
