                           : STARTUP PARAMETERS :

When you start Yeager Air Combat, the program automatically detects the best
graphics mode for your computer and starts the game in that mode.  However, if
you want to start the game in a different graphics mode, you can do so by
adding a few extra characters (called arguments) to the start command.

The program does not automatically detect CMS Boards or the Covox Speech Thing.
You need to instruct the game with an argument to use these cards.

EXAMPLE: Let's say you want to load the game with EGA graphics mode and music
generated with a CMS Board (you must have a CMS board installed).  You'd type
YEAGER EGA CMS and press Enter.

The order of the extra arguments doesn't matter as long as there's a space
between each argument.

These are the arguments you can use:

CGA           Loads game with CGA graphics.
EGA           Loads game with EGA graphics.
MCGA          Loads game with MCGA graphics (Same graphics as VGA, but slower.
              Maintains compability with PS/2 25 and 30).
TGA           Loads game with Tandy graphics.
VGA           Loads game with VGA graphics.
SLOWCARD      When you are in MCGA or VGA mode, if the game freezes on
              startup, or if you get sound but the wrong colors or no colors at
              all, try this parameter.  It slows down the interface between
              the computer and the video card.
FASTCARD      Deactivates Slowcard.
JOYSTICK      Loads game with joystick flight control.
KEYBOARD      Loads game with keyboard flight control.
MOUSE         Loads game with mouse flight control.
MOUSE2        Loads game with high-resolution mouse flight control.
LOW           Loads game in low graphics detail mode (less detail speeds up
              game play).
MEDIUM        Loads game in medium graphics detail mode (less detail speeds up
              game play).
HIGH          Loads game in high graphics detail mode.
NOSOUND       Loads game with sound turned off.
NOSPEECH      Loads game with digitized speech turned off.  It also reduces the
              amount of disk swapping necessary when playing on four 360K
              floppies.
PC            Loads game with PC internal speaker sounds.

ADLIB         Loads game with AdLib sound card sounds.
BLASTER       Loads game with Sound Blaster sound card sounds.
TANDY         Loads game with Tandy 1000 sound.
TANDYDAC      Loads game in Tandy 1000 models equipped with DAC (such as
              the Tandy 1000 TL),which results in clearer digitized speech.
COVOX1        Loads game with loud speech driver for the Covox Speech Thing
              on parallel port 1. Note: there is no auto-detect for Covox so
              this parameter is required if you want to use Covox.
COVOX2        Loads game with loud speech driver for the Covox Speech Thing
              on parallel port 2. Note: there is no auto-detect for Covox, so
              this parameter is required if you want to use Covox.
CMS           Loads sound driver for CMS music board.  Note: there is no
              speech driver for CMS, so digitized speech will play through
              the PC's internal speaker. Also, there is no auto-detect for
              CMS, so this parameter is required if you want to use your
              CMS Board.
SMALL         Use this if you have a computer with less than 640K of memory.
              It deletes complex versions of some shapes to speed up the
              simulation.
LARGE         Deactivates Small.
ALL           If you want to be able to play all missions without having to
              win each one, type this parameter to make all missions available
              immediately.  This is a default parameter.
CAMPAIGN      Starts new campaign.  In order to advanced in Campaign Mode,
              you will need to land safely at your home base after successfully
              completing each mission.

Note: when you quit the game, the program automatically remembers all of that
game's startup parameters, as well as all the items checked on the drop-down
menus.  The next time you start the game, just type YEAGER and press Enter, and
those same parameters and menu items will be in effect.  Also, if you quit the
game in the middle of a Campaign, and you want to retum to where you left off,
be sure not to select the Campaign parameter the next time you start up the
game, as that will put you at the beginning of a new campaign.

                   : KEYBOARD PROCEDURES FOR NON MOUSE USERS :

Tab           Moves cursor arrow sequentially through option "buttons."
Spacebar      Selects option beneath cursor arrow.
Enter         Selects option with >"text"< (arrows) on either side.  Note: this
              may be different than the button the cursor arrow points to, so
              you can hit Enter to save time.
Esc           Exit to previous screen.
Backspace     Backup one screen when creating a custom mission.

"Hot keys"    Most options can be selected by pressing the first letter of the
              first word.  For example, "Test  Flight" is selected from the
              main menu by pressing T.

Note: On the Historical Mission Selection screen, pressing 1, 2, or 3 will
select the first, second, or third mission visible on the screen.

waypoint.
