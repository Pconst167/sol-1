LOTUS 111: THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE
=================================

When  we  completed  Lotus  II,  we  didn't think that there was
anywhere else to take an arcade racing game, and we did not plan
to  do  any  further  Lotus  games.  Then many fans of the Lotus
games, however, continued to write and telephone us, demanding a
third Lotus game.  After a while, we sat down, and over a period
of  a few weeks discussed if there was anything else we could do
that  would match the standard of the first two games, break new
ground,  and  once that was done take it sufficiently beyond the
other  racing  games  that were around.  If we couldn't take the
new  game  further than the competition, then we would be better
advised  to spend our time on a different project.  After around
a  month  of serious consideration, be believed that we could do
enough  with  a  new  game  in  the  form  of  new  features and
additions,  to make it worthy of, and take it far enough beyond,
the  first  two Lotus games.  People demanded Lotus III, so here
it is-The Ultimate Challenge.  The ultimate Lotus racing game.

So What's New?
--------------
About three trillion tracks for a start, but more on that later.
Lotus III combines all the best elements of the first two games,
introduces a number of new features, and puts the control firmly
in  the  hands  of  the  player.   The expanded range of options
allows  the  player  to  alter  the majority of features to suit
themselves.   As  well as all the features brought over from the
first  two  games,  crammed in there are five new themed levels,
each  with  it's own unique graphic style, and new features that
affect  the  handling  of  your  car.  There is the stunning new
Lotus  concept  car,  the  M200.   This  car  will never go into
production,  so  this will be the only opportunity you will ever
get to 'drive' one.  On top of all that lot there's a whole host
of new music and sound effects, and loads of new graphics.

RECS
----
The  most  startling  addition,  however,  is  the stunning RECS
system,  which  will  give  you access to a practically infinite
number  of  different  tracks.  (For the more pedantic among you
the actual number is (26^D)x99 -somewhere around ten followed by
twenty  three noughts.) Just about every other game to feature a
track  creation  system  has  followed  the  standard  system of
including  a  track editor, which means having to spend maybe an
hour  or  more designing a single track, and then having to save
to  a  data  disk,  and then physically sending it to anyone who
wanted  to  see  your  stunning  creation.  Days, or even weeks,
might  pass  before  anyone ever tried your circuits or designs.
With  Lotus  III, each track you design will take as little as a
minute,  and  will  generate  a  code which can then be given to
anyone  instantly,  and  they  will  then  be  able to play your
creation  within  seconds,  and  there's  no messing around with
extra  data disks either.  In addition, you could enter your own
name as a password to see exactly how difficult or easy that is.
It's straightforward, easy and instant-and like all the features
of  the  earlier  Lotus  games, it's so good that other software
houses  will  be featuring it in their games in about six months
time.  

Playing Lotus III
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Quick Start Guide
---------------------
Okay, so Lotus III isn't the most complex simulation around, but
the  wealth  of  choices  and  options could throw you at first.
However, those who have played Lotus I and II will probably want
to  get  racing straight away, so here's a guide to getting down
to  racing  instantly.   Once  the  first option screen appears,
click  on  'Start', and, after pressing fire a couple more times
to  select  your sound effects and car, you will be taken to the
starting  line  of  the  first  predetermined race in the Arcade
season.

The Complete Works
------------------  
For  the  more methodical amongst you, this section will explain
what  each  of  the  available  options  can  do.  First off, an
explanation  of  all  the  options  available to you on the main
playing screen.


Main Playing Screen

Note:   All input, even for Player Two, is input from the Player
        One joystick on the Main Playing Screen.

This  is  the  screen  where you will make most of the decisions
regarding  the  game.   To highlight a particular option, simply
move the red rectangle by using the joystick, until it surrounds
the  icon  of  your  choice.   If  two  options are offered in a
particular  box,  hitting fire will toggle between the two.  The
different options available to you are as follows.

Player One
----------
This  will  allow  you  to  alter the name of Player One.  To do
this, highlight this option and then type in the new name.

Start
-----
This  is the option which will begin the race once you are happy
with all the selections that you have made.

Player Two
----------
Exactly  the  same  as for Player One, this option allows you to
alter the name of th~ second player.

Gears
-----
Allows Player One to select Manual or Automatic Gears.

Game
----
This  option  let's  you select between Championship and Arcade.
Each  is  a  mix  of the circuits of Lotus I, and the checkpoint
sections of Lotus II.

Arcade Mode
-----------
In Arcade mode, represented by the clock, the aim is to complete
each  stage  within the allotted time (indicated on the screen).
This  is  a  race  for  points, the aim being to get the highest
score possible.  To make things even more straightforward, there
are no fuel stops required for Arcade racing.

Championship Mode
-----------------
The  Championship  mode, represented by the Cup, is very similar
to Lotus I.  This takes the form of a championship season, where
overall  success  is  dependant  upo  finishing  in  the top ten
drivers  of  each race.  Points are awarded after each race, and
your  starting position in the next race will be decided by your
finishing position in the last race.  If you finished first, you
would  begin  the next race in twentieth, if you finished second
you  would begin in nineteenth, and so on.  For more information
on  the  different  race styles, see the section entitled Racing
late  Gears  As for Player One, this allows Player Two to select
between Manual and Automatic gears.

Accelerate
----------
Allows Player One to select whether pressing the fire button, or
pushing forward on the joystick will accelerate his/her vehicle.
Depending  upon  which  is  chofien, the following controls will
apply:

                  Fire Button       Forward
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Steer Left        Joystick Left     Joystick Left
Steer Right       Joystick Right    Joystick Right
Accelerate        Fire Button       Joystick Forward
Brake             Joystick Back     Joystick Back
Change Up a Gear  Joystick Forward  Joystick Forward/Fire

Course
~~~~~~
This option allows you to select either one of the predetermined
tracks,  to chose single user defined track, or a whole sequence
of user defined circuits and tracks, as follows:

Selecting a predefined sequence
-------------------------------
There  are  six  different predefined sequences built into Lotus
III, namely an easy level, a medium level, and a difficult level
on each of the Championship and Arcade levels.  Easy consists of
seven  tracks, Medium of ten, and Difficult of fifteen, making a
total  of  sixty  four  predefined tracks.  To select any of the
three,  simply  highlight  one of the left three options in this
box.

Selecting your own track
------------------------
If  you  select  the fourth option along, this will allow you to
race  a  track  which  you  have  previously defined on the RECS
screen.   This  option can be highlighted either before or after
you go to the RECS screen to create a track.

Selecting a sequence of player designed circuits
------------------------------------------------
The  final  option  will take the player to a new screen where a
sequence  of  user defined circuits can be created.  To create a
sequence, see the 'Define' sequence below.

Acceleration
------------
As  for  Player  One,  this  allows Player Two to select his/her
chosen method of acceleration.

Control (Player One)
-------------------=
For player One this is always the joystick.

Number of Players
-----------------
The Player selects whether it is a One Player or Two Player Game.

Control (Player Two)
--------------------
If  Player  Two  selects  the  joystick, then he should have the
joystick  plugged  into I 1(0 on ST).  If the keyboard option is
selected, then the following controls apply:

L         Emulates Joystick Forwards
, (Comma) Emulates Joystick Backwards
Z         Emulates Joystick Left
X         Emulates Joystick Right
Space     Emulates Joystick Fire

Of  course,  which  key  is used to accelerate is dependant upon
whehter  joystick  forwards  or joystick fire has been chosen as
the accelerate key.

Constructor
-----------
Choosing this will take the player to the RECS screen, which has
a more detailed section later in the manual.

Code
----
If  the player knows the code of a particularly hot course, then
rather than going to the editor, the number can be entered here.
It is done in the same way that entering a players name is done.
Alternatively,  if  the  player wants to find out how difficult
racing round 'FRANKIE 50' is, it can be typed in here.

Define
------
The  bottom  panel is used to enter the codes for the predefined
circuits.   The  keyboard should be used to enter the first nine
letters.   (You  could,  of course, choos to have a three letter
word  followed  by  six blank spaces.) The cursor pad is used to
move  the  cursor  to  the  right,  and to put it in the correct
position to enter the last two numbers.  Once the last number is
entered,  the  Down  Cursor key should be pressed to take you to
the  next line, and allow you to enter another track code.  Once
you are happy with the selection you have made, use the joystick
to highlight the 'Exit' panel

That's  everything  on  the Main Screen covered.  Following is a
detailed explanation of the RECS system.

RECS
====
RECS is the innovative and original new track design system that
will  allow  the player to create stunning tracks in a matter of
seconds.  Creating tracks is amazingly simple, and once created,
there's  no messing around with saving to disk- or anywhere else
for that matter.  Exchanging tracks with a friend to see who can
get the best time on it couldn't be simpler, and all you need to
do  is  pass  on the code.  Your friend can then enter the code,
and  the  track  will  be identical to the one that you created.
Once  you've  both  practised  on it, then the fun really starts
when you go head to head against each other!  And with literally
billions  of  different  tracks to play, you'll be playing Lotus
III for ages!

DESIGNING A TRACK
-----------------
Each  of  the  different  sections  on  this screen allow you to
influence the style and form of your track.  Most are rated from
0% to 100% in 4% increments.  Each affects the track as follows:

Type
----
Choose whether the race will be laps or stages.

Curves
------
This  will  determine  how  many  curves your track is likely to
have.   Obviously,  the lower the percentage, the straighter the
track will be.  Higher percentages will mean that your track has
a lot of curves.

Sharpness
---------
Sharpness  will influence the actual type of bends and curves on
your  track.  A lower number will make for gentler turns, whilst
the higher numbers will create some really tricky corners.

Length
------
The determines the length of the track.

Exit
----
Once you are happy with the track that you have designed, select this 
option and you will be taken back to the main playing screen.

Hills
-----
This option allows you to decide on the number of hills that
there will be. A low number will mean that you will have a very 
flat track, while a high number will mean that the track will 
be extremely hilly.

Steepness
---------
Not  surprisingly,  this  option  will  allow  you to affect the
steepness of the hills on th circuit.  Gently undulating scenery
or steep ascents and descents?  It's your choice.

Difficulty
----------
As  if  creating a tortuously bendy hilly circuit wasn't enough,
you now get to influence the difficulty of the track.  This will
affect  the  aggressiveness  of  the other drivers, how tight the
time is on the circuit, and so on.

Code
----
The  code  for  the  circuit  that you are creating is displayed
here.   To  save  you going through the trouble of designing the
same  circuit again and again, you can simply make a note of the
code here, and enter it on the main screen in the future.  A lot
more  straightforward  than  messing  around with data disks and
other such stuff.

Scenery
-------
Do  you want to be racing through featureless deserts or scenery
packed  oases?  Again, the choice is yours.  Obviously, the less
scenery  there  is,  the  more time the computer can dedicate to
bringing  you  an  ultra smooth update, but even with scenery at
100%  it's  probably  still  got the fastest, smoothest and most
impressive update around anyway.

Scatter
-------
Neat  park-like  rows  of  trees  and  bushes  and ornaments, or
greenery scattered about everywhere?  Take your pick.

Obstacles
---------
This  will  allow  you  to  choose between an obstacle free open
freeway,  or the sort of assault course normally associated with
the SAS.

Scenario
--------
This  will  allow  you to select which of the thirteen different
scenarios  you  wish  to  race on.  Each one will have different
effects  on  your  vehicle,  how  it  handles,  and  so on.  The
thirteen, running from left to right, are as follows:

Rally
-----
With  more  mud  and  water on the track than by the side of it,
this  type  of track will prove difficult for any driver, in any
vehicle.

Futuristic
----------
Set  against the background of a city of the future, this is one
of  the most demanding types of circuit.  Amongst the more usual
hazards,  there  are  magnets by the side of the road which will
attract  your  vehicle,  (Okay,  you're  right,  Lotus  cars are
constructed  from fibre glass, but then this is the future after
all.)  and  a laser beam that will drastically slow your vehicle
if  it  should  hit  vou.  Nlght The darkness on this level will
prove  to  be  as  hazardous as the fog.  Limited visibility and
other  drivers  who  are  also hindered by the lac of light will
make for some tricky manoeuvring.

Marsh
-----
Oil  and  mud  on  the  track, and sections which are completely
submerged by water cause some very tricky hazards.  You're never
going  to  make  ultra  fast  times on these sections, but then,
finishing these sections is an achievement.

Mountains
---------
With  a  cliff  on one side, and huge mountains and hills on the
other, it's just about impossible to stray off the track on this
one.   This  lack  of manoeuvrability and margin for error makes
this   level   particularly   difficult   for   overtaking   and
accelerating to any great speed.

Snow
----
Another  favourite from the earlier Lotus games, the deceptively
pretty  scenery  creates  some  of  the  most  hazardous  racing
conditions  around.   There's  not  only the slippery surface to
deal with, but also the driving snow to obscure your vision.

Roadworks
---------
Complete  with  road cones, signs, hazard barriers and potholes,
the  roadworks  make  the  roads ultra thin, and make overtaking
almost  impossible.  You're really going to need your wits about
you to succeed on this level.

Storm
-----
Just  the  sort of driving experience to test the best.  Beating
rain  and roaring thunder serve to make the drive difficult, and
the  road conditions can't exactly be described as the best.  in
the world.

Desert
------
Like the snow, this is another level where it's best to stick to the
middle of the track if possible. As you drift from the centre, there's
more sand on the surface which will really slow up the Lotus. Get to
the edges of the track, and there will even be small sand drifts to
hinder you.

Fog
---
Definitely  one  of  the  most  difficult  stages,  the fog will
obscure   your   vision,   and   make   racing   even  the  most
straightforward  track a difficult task for the most experienced
driver.

Motor way
---------
One  of  the favourites from Lotus II, this section contains not
only  your  lane of traffic, but also oncoming traffic!  It's up
to  you  whether  you take the chance to cross into the oncoming
traffic-it's  easier  to  overtake the other racers, but there's
also the traffic coming towards you to worry about.

Wind
----
This isn't the sort of wind that might dry your washing, this is
the  sort  of  wind that will push your car from one side of the
track to the other without any fuss.  A hurricane in pixels.

Forest
------
Dense  trees line this stage, and you will find water, trees and
logs  strewn  across  the  track.   Hitting  a  log, rather than
damaging  the  car, will cause the car to do a spectacular jump,
useful for overtaking or jumping over track hazards.

Racing
======
That's  all the introductory stuff out of the way, now let's get
on  with  what  you're  here for-the racing.  Just to recap, you
will   remember  that  once  you  are  happy  with  the  current
configuration of the game on the Game Setup Screen, clicking on
'Start' will take you to the starting line of the first race.

Selecting Music
----------------
This  is  done by Player One.  Once you have chosen 'Start', you
still  have  two  decisions to make.  The first is to select the
music  or  sound  effects  that will accompany the race.  The CD
screen,  first  featured  in  Lotus I will appear.  To chang the
music  track, simply move the joystick left or right, and wait a
few  seconds  while the new track loads.  Once you are happy, hit
the fire button.

Selecting Your Car
------------------
The next decision to be made is which of the three cars you will
drive.  Again, eac~ will appear on the screen in turn.  Once the
car  that  you wish to drive appears on the screen, hit the fire
button  to  go to the starting line of the race.  Again.  Player
One  selects  for both players, as it would be unfair if the two
drivers were driving different cars.

Once  you  are  at  the starting line, what you will see on your
screen   will   be  dependa  upon  whether  you  are  racing  in
Championship or Arcade mode.

Championship
------------
In  Championship mode the aim is to finish as the top racer over
a season.  The player must finish in the top ten in each race in
order to go onto the next race.  As stated earlier, the starting
position  in  the  next  race  is  determined  by  the finishing
position  of  the  current race.  If there are two players, then
providing  that at least íl driver finishes in the top ten, then
they  will both be carried into the next race.  This is the more
difficult of the two types of race, and this is reflected in the
display.

Pit Stops
---------
Pit  Stops  are  required  for  some  of  the longer sections or
circuits  in  the  Championship  mode.   Pitstops  are  situated
directly after the starting line in circuits or directly after a
Checkpoint  for the linear sections.  In order to refuel, simply
pull  onto  the  wider strip of track situated on the right hand
side  of  the  track  directly  after  the  signs,  and stop the
vehicle.   You  will  see  that  your  fuel gauge indicator will
gradually  fill up.  As soon as you are happy with the amount of
fuel  you  have,  push  forward  and  hit the fire button on the
joystick,  and  you  will  rejoin  the race.  On all but the 
mountain level, they are indicated by a sign.

Arcade
------
Arcade  mode is a straightforward race for points, the aim being
to  finish each race with the largest number of points possible,
and  within the time limit. There are no refuelling stops required
in  Arcade  mode.   The  display  is similar to the Championship
mode, but differs in the following important areas. If one player 
manages to finish within the allotted time, then both players will be
carried through to the next round.

Two Player Mode
---------------
In  two  player  mode, a small box will apprear in the top right
corner of the screen, indicating either how far ahead, or behind
the  other  player you are.  Your car is represented by the line
in  the  centre  of  the  box,  and  if you are behind the other
player,  a  coloured  band  will  form  to  the  right  of this,
indicating  how  far  behind you are.  If vou are ahead.  then a
band  will  form  to  the left. 

If the screen is showing a line here, this indicates that you 
are in front of the other driver.

If a line appears here, this indicates that 10th other 
driver is well in front of you.

Game Over
--------
Should  the player fail to finish in the top ten in Championship
Mode,  or  fail  to  fin within the time allowed in Arcade Mode,
then the current game will be over, and Main Options Screen will
appear again.

Any Problems?
-------------
If  you  have problems loading Lotus III, then return it to your
retailer, or to Greml] Graphics at the address on the packaging.
If  you have any questions relating to th game, then the Gremlin
Graphics  Helpline  is  available  between the hours of 2.00 and
4.00 U.K.  time Monday to Friday, on 0742 753 423.
