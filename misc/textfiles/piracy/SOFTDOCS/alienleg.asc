        Well after spending about 16 hours playing this game. It gets half
     a thumbs up from me. I mean so far so good but not enough action in
     the game and too much management. But I will explain the general
     concept of the game and what you can expect for a 7 disk download. You
     are in command of the Calypso, a "seed ship" sent to the Alpha Ceali
     system to colonize a planet and take mankind's first permanent step
     into the stars. While you were in hyper sleep, Earth had designed and
     perfected a new seed ship engine which would travel faster than you
     ship. Matter of fact, it would beat you to the planet by a large
     margin so the United Nations decides to send it and to also send you a
     couple of communications explaining the details and who your knew
     commanding officer will be instead of you running the project
     yourself. After awakening, you read the messages and also get a few
     others showing that the colony is nowhere in sight. The ship has
     arrived before you but there are little to no traces of it. You also
     realize that a magnetic flux storm wiped away a good portion of your
     ships computer system memory and bits and pieces of information get
     restored as you play onward. I will not spoil some of these messages
     since this is sufficient to set up the theme of the game. Through
     colonizing, researching, developing, and probing other planets in the
     system, you will uncover all the secrets of what happened to the
     missing colony.

        The game starts out with you on the bridge of the Calypso after the
     intro. and few messages from your officers. You can move the pointer
     around the screen and see various stations that you can left click on
     to activate.
     
     BRIDGE:
     
     Military Advisor - This is your chief military advisor. You can ask
     her for advice and she will contact you from time to time to inform
     you of new military technical projects that can be researched as well
     as other military matters.
     
     Chief Navigator - This officer informs you of stellar events as well
     as probe results. He will also report other happenings in space and
     other matters dealing with space craft.
     
     Science Advisor - This officer will inform you of scientific
     breakthroughs and suggest new ideas for research.
     
     Chief Engineer - This advisor keeps you up to date on the status of
     the Calypso, as well as suggesting  new research.
     
     Robot - The Robot will tell you of advanced scientific breakthroughs
     that are mainly in the computer/electronics category and it is
     responsible for repairing the Calypso's computer systems. The Robot
     also maintains your PDA (Personal Desk Assistant) which keeps track of
     your  log, other unfinished tasks and information on the totals of
     your colonies, and the casualties suffered in battle overall.
     
     View Solar System - This takes you to the Star Map which is explained
     later.
     
     See Ship's Resources - This takes you to the buildings of Calypso. It
     is managed and built upon just like any other colony which will be
     explained later.
     
     
     POP UP MENU
     
        By right clicking just about anywhere in the game excepts where
     noted otherwise, you can access the "pop-up menu" which will take you
     quickly to anywhere in the game.
     
     Bridge - Takes you to the Bridge.
     
     Space map - Takes you to the Space Map.
     
     Colony Manager - Takes you to where you can manage your colonies.
     
     Vehicles Manager - Takes you where you can view/manage your spacecraft
     including the Calypso.
     
     Tech Manager - This takes you to the research and development menu.
     
     Pause - Pauses game.
     
     Options - Takes you to the Game Options menu.
     
     Quit - Allows you to quit the game.
     
     
     SPACE MAP
     
        The Space Map is a 3D, fully rotatable and scalable map. You can
     select planets via the planet quick buttons on the right of the map
     (you'll begin to recognize them as you access the map more and more)
     or you can just left quick right on the planet or object of your
     choice. Right clicking on the Space Map brings up several options to
     choose from. These are self explanatory so I will not go into
     explaining them. At the bottom left, you will find the text box. This
     box will display various information like planet name, turns elapsed,
     and game speed. To the right of the text box is the game speed slide
     bar. This will allow you to compress time and slow it back down at
     your discretion. This allows you to "burn" turns when you have nothing
     else to do but that's rare so use it with caution. The other buttons
     to the right of the slide bar will allow you or rotate and zoom in and
     out on the planet map. When you see small twinkling spots around
     planets, these represent your craft. Your dots are green, the enemies,
     well, you'll find out sooner or later.
     
     COLONY MANAGER
     
        This is the comprehensive listing and control menu to view and
     quickly access all your colonies. The big blocks of information on the
     left, displays a detailed count of all the resources of your colony. I
     will explain what all the iconic representations mean in the detailed
     colony map section. By clicking on one of the large boxes of
     information, you will immediately be taken to the detailed
     "construction" map of that colony. To access the other colonies when
     you get beyond 3 colonies, you can scroll the listing with the arrows
     at the very bottom and then select the colony or you can use the sort
     list located to the right of the boxed information. This area as a
     whole is the best way to keep an eye on how your colonies are doing at
     a glance.
     
     Detailed Colony Map - This is where you actually construct facilities
     to meet your colonies needs. The starting facilities that you can
     build are Habitats, Factories, Power Plants, and Research Labs. To
     construct a building, use the left and right arrows below the building
     picture in the upper right corner of the screen to select the building
     you wish to construct. Then click and hold the left mouse button ON
     the building's picture. No drag that picture to the location that you
     wish to construct the building on the map portion of the screen. You
     will see a darker are highlighted when you can build in a location.
     Keep in mined that any one colony can only have a maximum of 16
     buildings but through upgrading your buildings when you discover new
     technology, you can get more performance from those 16 buildings.
     Constructing Buildings game turns. By positioning the pointers of your
     buildings, it will give you all the information you need to know about
     the building. Anything in red on this list is what your building lacks
     in order to be built, upgraded, or just plain operated. To upgrade a
     building or change what it's producing, just right  click on the
     building you wish to affect and you will then see a menu that is self
     explanatory. Notice the colored "dots" next to each building? These
     are at a glance indicators to tell you how your colonies are doing.
     Green means everything is OK while light green means off-line which
     takes a building out of the power grid and conserves energy and other
     resources. Red means without power or resources needed to operate.
     Yellow dots mean you can upgrade that particular facility. Blue dots
     mean under construction or upgrade. TO move around the map portion of
     the screen, hold down the left mouse button and move the pointer
     towards the edge of the screen that you wish to move towards. The map
     will then scroll that direction. The closer to the edge, the closer
     you will scroll.
     The icons at the bottom of the screen shows what resources are
     available to your colony. These are from top left to bottom right:
     
     ORE
     POWER
     LIFE SUPPORT
     HUMANS
     ROBOTS
     HABITATS
     FACTORIES
     POWER PLANTS
     RESEARCH LABS
     SPACE CRAFT
     
     When starting a colony, it is wise to build 1 habitat, 1 factory, and
     one power plant. You will need to transport some resources from
     Calypso, over to the colony. You might have to use several ships to do
     this if you are in a hurry.
     
     
     VEHICLE MANAGER
     
        This is very similar to the colony manager screen excepts that it
     pertains to vehicles. You will start with 4 space craft and the
     Calypso. Each of the larger boxes on the left represent a space craft.
     By clicking on one, you are immediately taken to the hanger where it
     is located weather it is on a planet, space station, or aboard the
     Calypso. These boxes also show information like the vehicle
     identification, the pilot, where the ship is at, and the fuel it has
     aboard. To the upper right is a sort box and on the right is a planet
     list. These are ways of locating a ship via other means.
     
     Hangers - In the hanger, you will see a picture of your ship, several
     icons that are the same as the colony icons, and a mission selector
     and target selector. This is where you load cargo onto your ship by
     clicking with the left mouse button ON the icon of what you want to
     send, and unload your ship by doing the same with the right mouse
     button. You select the type of mission then the target of that
     particular mission. Be sure to set the target for your mission as well
     by left clicking on that button. Missions are discussed in detail
     below.
     
     Explore - This will allow you to pilot a craft around the planet that
     you are currently on, and explore the surface. You will also be able
     to collect commodities such as ore, life support, power, robots, all
     kinds of tech points, special items, and things important to the games
     plot line. Once you take off, you will see a satellite view of the
     planet. The planet as you will notice, is broken down into grids.
     These grids may even extend off the screen to the right, so by using
     the arrows on the left side of the screen, you can move the grid
     pointer to the right and scroll the planet to see how big it is. Other
     buttons are added to this screen as you develop new technology but for
     the time being, you start with (from top left to bottom) the ore
     scanner, the power scanner, and the build colony button. The scanners
     will locate grid locations that contain that type of commodity. You
     must find specific locations that are suitable in order to build
     colonies. A little bit into the game, you should develop a colony
     scanner which shows you all the places to build colonies in the
     immediate area. A trick you building your first colony on a new planet
     is to send the ship to the center of he planet. Then scan for power.
     Go to the power sector and collect as much power as you can. Then
     leave the sector. Now scan for a place to build a colony. GO there,
     build the colony then click on it to land in the colony. Now you have
     power in the colony and it will refuel your ship every time it lands.
     This is a quick way to set up a ship outpost even if you don't develop
     a colony per say. TO land at any sector, just click on that sector to
     move the ship there, then click again to land. Remember, your ships
     use fuel for everything they do. keep an eye on the fuel gauge else
     you will see some snazzy animation showing your ship careening into
     the surface. Once you make a landing, you are now in a 3D mode and are
     able to skim the fractally generated surface of the planet. There is a
     compass to the upper right that displays your ships heading. A picture
     of the pilot. A top view of the entire planet that acts as a "radar
     and will display all scanned objects. There are also fuel gauges and
     cargo capacity gauges below this. At the bottom of the screen you will
     see several icons. From left to right these are: Planet View Toggle
     (between top and 3D view), Planet Scan (shows just about everything on
     the planet), Bomb (be careful where you drop these!), Cargo List/Drop
     (shows a detailed manifest of cargo and allows you to jettison some),
     Movement arrows, these will make the ship turn left, right or move
     forward. You can also use the cursor arrow keys for movement and the
     mouse for picking things up off the planet. Leave will allow you to
     gain altitude and go to another sector. To pick up and object, just
     position a pointer on it and when the pointer turns into a hand, click
     the left mouse button. If there is nothing left on a planet, you will
     get a "sector clear" message. If you don't see anything after
     scanning, and still haven't gotten a sector clear message, then
     there's something still there you will just have to look for manually.
     Also while you are flying, if the pointer is not positioned over an
     object, your pointer will be crosshairs. If you left click the mouse
     with this pointer, you will shoot the ships lasers. You will go on a
     target run on a planet once you military advisor sets it up. Other
     weapons become available through invention.
     
     Probe - This mission allows you to send a ship to another planet and
     start collecting planetary data and forming a topological survey. Once
     this is complete, you can build colonies there and explore the
     surface.
     
     Transport - This simply tells a ship to go from here to there taking
     with it anything ins it's holds and then depositing them at the target
     location.
     
     Pipeline - This is a nice but tricky mission to assign. If you have a
     colony that is producing large amounts of a commodity and you will
     continuously need these commodities some where's else, set up a
     pipeline between the two which acts like the Transport command but the
     ship will fly in a continuos loop back and forth between the two
     continuing to deposit the same cargo that was first assigned. Saves on
     repetition but difficult to calculate a safe amount of cargo to take
     without depleting the producing colony.
     
     Space Station - This mission tells the ship to establish a space
     station around the target planet. These can be colonized and built up
     just like any other colony.
     
     
     TECHNOLOGY MANAGER
     
        The Tech manager is where you start inventing new technology and
     seeing the totals of all the Tech Points that are created by Research
     Labs and gathered on planets. The categories are:
     
     ASTRONOMY
     CHEMISTRY
     ELECTRONICS
     GEOLOGY
     BIOLOGY
     MATHEMATICS
     PHYSICS
     
     Each invention will cost a certain amount of tech points from all or
     some of the above categories so it is important to keep a good
     stockpile in each category. When you see that you can invent
     something, the amount of tech points required is above the tech point
     icons whereas your total of tech points is below the tech point icons.
     If you do not have enough tech points in one or more categories to
     invent something, then those areas will be highlighted in red. When
     you have sufficient tech points to invent and everything is green,
     then click on "invent". You will then see how man days until
     completion below the text box that explains and invention. After the
     item has been invented, the text box will change to explain the
     inventions exact use instead of the theory behind the invention.
     
     
     MISC.
     
     The leave button steps you out of a screen or you can use the pop up
     menu with the right mouse button.
     
     Whenever an advisor has something important to tell you, a small
     button grouping will appear in the upper left corner of the screen.
     Just click on the ones that have a lit green light next to them.
     
     When you hear "Eureka!", that means an invention has been finished.
     
     Read your PDA whenever you forget something. It also keeps track of
     all kinds of interesting data that is important to the plot of the
     game.
     
     


        Well that's it so I hope you enjoy this game. It's alright in the 
     beggining but get's better as you play it with new colony buildings
     and new ship weapons etc...
