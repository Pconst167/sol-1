To whom it may concern

It  is  our  duty to inform you of the death of your grandfather, Commander
Peter Jameson.

The  wreckage  of  his ship was found in the Reidquat system on 11 November
3199.   He  was  presumed  killed in combat after a "misunderstanding" over
some stolen goods according to the local press.

A  last  will and testament was prepared on 3 February 3199 and section 4.1
has  been  circulated to all living grandchildren as instructed by our late
client.

If  you have any queries do not hesitate to contact us.  The normal fees of
fifty (50) Credits per hour (including service tax) apply.


Yours sincerely

                  Last Will & Testament

Commander Peter Jameson                                       Section 4.1

A way of life that is very different to the dull planet bound existence you
have probably led up to now.  It is a way of life that I loved and want you
to experience.

I  want  you  to feel the freedom of flying your own ship and being able to
explore  the vast galaxy.  Whatever your aims in life (I settled for wealth
power  and fame) there is an occupation for you.  Try your hand at trading,
following  established trading routes or making your own.  May be doing odd
jobs  is  more your style buzzing from one place to the next, never working
for the same person twice.  What about mining?  Later perhaps.

I  know  that some of you will succumb to a criminal existance, so I may as
well say that piracy, bounty hunting and mercenary work will suit you.

I  won`t  tell you to place your allegiance with the Federation, the Empire
or the Indepandents but be careful they all use you for their own aims.  No
amount of treaties will change the fact that they dislike each other

Space  has changed a great deal since I was your age.  No I am not going to
harp  on about everything being cheaper and friendlier in the past.  People
were  just  as bad then as now but we now have better technology and humans
have spread further so there is more scope.  Your abilities as a pilot will
be tested to the full, especially in combat so before you upset anybody get
in some practice.

I  want  to give you the best start I can.  As there are now so many of you
my  resources  have  been spread thinly.  Each of you will receive an Eagle
Long Range Fighter and one hundred credits.  The ship has been delivered to
your local starport but the documents are enclosed with this letter

Above all enjoy yourself and BE WARY!


              Mortal Press 2/2TX4-LWT

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


WELCOME!

CONGRATULATIONS  on  buying  the  Eagle  Long  Range  Fighter,  clearly the
purchase of a discerning pilot!

As  you  will no doubt have noticed, our continual quest for excellence has
resulted  in  this,  the  culmination  of  the search for the most advanced
technology and ergonomic design, embodied in one ship.  We are proud of the
individualistic  style  married with functional superiority, as we continue
the Faulcon De Lacy pedigree.

As  you  are  obviously  a  cut  above  the  common  space  traveller,  the
understated  styling  of  the  interior will have impressed you.  A dynamic
spacehound  such  as yourself will not have time for unnecessary frills, so
we  have  styled  the  interior  with  the  minimum  of fuss, just like the
exterior.   Particularly pleasing though, are the lines of the pilot's seat
made  of  revolutionary  Silastoplaston,  a  material that stays dry at all
times.   It  really gives the message that you are in control!  It feels as
though  you  are  immersed  in water while it protects you from dangerously
high acceleration forces.

Always mindful of necessity we have included the 1MW Phlaschgyt Pulse Laser
weapon.   The  laser  is  noted  for  being  compact,  economical and again
understated  the hallmark of this craft.  As if that is not enough, we have
installed  the  latest  Manolife one man life support system that keeps you
cooking  at  the  right  temperature  and nasty gases at bay.  We have been
accused  of  madness  for giving away lots more as part of a limited period
offer, just look at the specifications list!

Whether  on  the  run or just cruising, feel that tight gyroscopic control.
You  will  be  so  thrilled  with  the Eagle that you will want to purchase
accessories, available from all good Shipyards.

SECTION ONE - ICONS
===================

USING THE CONSOLE
-----------------

This  is  a guide to using the console to control your ship there is also a
summary sheet which summarises the use of icons.

SELECTING AN ICON
The  icons  are  activated  by  first  touching  them  with  the tip of the
mouse-controlled  pointer  and  then  pressing  the left hand mouse button.
Alternatively,  simply use the keyboard shortcuts (for the main icons there
are  function  keys  F1-F10  the  number  of  which  is shown at the bottom
right-hand  corner of the icon).  Note that all icons give an indication of
what  will  happen  if that icon is selected.  They do not show the current
mode.

The  four  main icons F1-F4 to the left-hand side of the scanner select the
current type of display.

The  icons  on  the  right-hand  side F7-F10 change depending on the active
display.

This  section  outlines the four main types of display and their associated
functions.

VIEW ICONS (F1)
---------------

These  icons  allow  you  to  cycle  through a choice of views of the space
through which you are travelling.  They are:  Front, Rear and External (and
Turret if fitted).  The position of the view from your ship is described in
the View Status area.

FRONT VIEW 
This gives the view in the direction in which your ship is pointing.  It is
not  necessarily  the direction in which you are travelling.  If you have a
gun  at the front, a sight will be positioned on the screen in the shape of
a cross.
 
REAR VIEW 
A  view  in exactly the opposite direction to the front view.  A sight will
only be visible if you have a gun mounted on the rear.

EXTERNAL VIEW 
An  external  view  is simulated by your onboard computer and can be useful
for  aligning your ship.  Some landings are particularly pleasing if viewed
in this mode.  Use the Arrow (Cursor) keys to change the angle of view, the
-  key  to zoom in and the + key to zoom out.  This can be used for general
surveillance of the surrounding space.

It  needs to be borne in mind that the view is locked to the orientation of
the  ship.   For example, if you are looking at the craft from the side and
it  is  rolling,  you  will  not  see it roll, but the space around it will
appear to move and the craft will stay still.

TURRET VIEW
If  you  have  top  or  bottom  turrets  on your ship this icon will become
available  and is needed in order to fire lasers from turrets.  If you have
two  turrets  (top and bottom) and you select this icon, the view presented
will  come  from  the  turret  you were using last.  Use of the right- hand
mouse  button will move the angle of view, not the orientation of the ship.
If,  when  using the mouse, you dip below the level of the turret, the view
automatically changes to the other turret if you have one.

FLIGHT CONTROL ICONS (F7)

This icon on the right hand side of the display is operational in View mode
only.   It  switches between Engines Off (Fig 2) and Manual flight (Fig 3).
If  you  have an Autopilot and have selected a target (see THE AUTOPILOT on
page 20), then the Flight Control icon will cycle through Autopilot (Fig 4)
too.   When  you are landed, the Vertical Take-Off icon (Fig 5) is the only
option  available.  The status of your ship and its engines is described in
the Ship Status area.

HYPERSPACE ICON (F8)

While in View mode select this icon (Fig 6) to make a hyperspace jump.  See
the NAVlGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 23 for details.

UNDERCARRIAGE ICON (F9)

In  View  mode use of these icons raises or lowers the undercarriage (Fig 7
and  Fig  8).   The  Autopilot does this automatically when landing, but in
Manual Flight you must operate it yourself.

IDENTIFICATION TEXT ICONS (F10)

In View mode these icons (Fig 9 and Fig 10) are used to name all identified
objects on your display to aid navigation as the name can sometimes be seen
before the body itself.

MAP ICONS (F2)
--------------

These icons cycle through two map pages:  Galactic Map (Fig 11) and Current
System  Map (Fig 12).  See the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 11 for
a  more  detailed  description.  Note that the functions of icons F7 to F10
are not always the same in Galactic Map and Current System Map (see below).

GALACTIC MAP ICON (F2)
 
A  grid  map  of  all  the  star systems in the galaxy is displayed and the
following options are available:
 
DATA ICON (F6) 

Gives  geographical and physical data on the selected system if it has been
explored This is only present if a system has been selected.
 
Selecting the Data icon calls up the following four functions:

GALACTIC MAP (F6) Returns you to the Galactic Map.

ECONOMY  ICON (F7) Gives data on imports, exports and illegal goods for the
selected system

SOCIAL  STRUCTURE  ICON (F8) Gives data on government type, population etc,
for the selected system.

ORBITAL  MAP  ICON  (F10)  Provides  a  diagram of the orbits of all bodies
within  the system shown.  They can be seen in motion using the Forward and
Rewind  icons  (see  below).  For closer observation of bodies use the Zoom
icons F7 and F8.

ZOOM ICONS (F7, F8)
Allow the view to be magnified (Fig 14) or reduced (Fig 15), except in Data
mode F6 where F7 and F8 are redefined for other uses.

TOOLS ICON (F9)
The galactic map can be redefined for easier and faster use.

Selecting the Tools icon calls up the following four functions:

STALKS  ICON  (F7) Turns height indication stalks on the galaxy grid map on
or off.

GRID ICON (F8) Turns grid on the Galactic Map on or off.

TRADE ROUTES ICON (F9) Turns Trade Routes on the Galactic Map on or off.

IDENTIFICATION  TEXT ICON (F10) Some text on the Galactic Map can be turned
on or off.

GALACTIC VIEW ICON (F10)

Shows  a  creator's  eye  view of the galaxy to remind you of how small you
are.   The  brightness  of each pixel depends on the number of stars in the
area  covered  by  that  pixel.  Use the Zoom icons F7 and F8 to adjust the
view.   Select the Galactic Map icon F10 (Fig 18) to return to the Galactic
Map.

CURRENT SYSTEM MAP (F2)
----------------------

Shows  an  orbital  map  of  the  system  through which you are travelling.
Again,  bodies can be seen in motion or at close range.  Use the Zoom icons
F7 and F8 to adjust the view.  The following options are also available:

TOOLS ICON (F9)
The orbital map can be redefined for easier and faster use.

Selecting the Tools icon (Fig 19) calls up the following two functions:

ORBITAL ICON (F9) Turns orbital lines on or off.

IDENTIFICATION TEXT ICON (F10) Turns names of bodies on or off.

TARGETING ICON (F10)

Enables  you  to  select  targets  for combat or the Autopilot.  Do this by
activating  the  icon  (Fig  20), then clicking on the body to be targeted.
See  the COMBAT section on page 35 and the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on
page 11.

INVENTORY ICONS (F3)
--------------------

If  activated.   this  icon  will cycle through seven information pages, in
order:

SHIP'S EQUIPMENT (see the SHIPYARD section on page 49)

COMMANDER PROFILE (see the COMBAT section on page 35)

CREW ROSTER (see the TRADlNG section on page 55)

CARGO ON BOARD (see the TRADlNG section on page 55)

PASSENGER ROSTER (see the TRADlNG section on page 55)

OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS LIST (see SHIP'S INVENTORY on page 60)

MININING INSTALLATIONS (see the MINING section on page 65)

See  also  SHIP'S INVENTORY on page 60 for a summary of the pages contents.
Note that if there is no information on a page it will not be displayed.

COMMUNICATION ICON (F4)
-----------------------

The  effect of this icon (Fig 21) is different depending on whether you are
landed (or docked) or in flight

COMMUNICATION WHILE LANDED (OR DOCKED)

When  this  icon  is  selected  a list of options will appear (Fig 22), for
example  Stockmarket  (See  the TRADING section on page 55), Bulletin Board
(see  the  TRADlNG  section on page 55), Launch Request (see the NAVlGATION
AND  FLIGHT  section  on  page  30)  and Shipyard Services (seeTHE SHIPYARD
section on page 49).

COMMUNICATION IN FLIGHT

A list of messages to be broadcast will be superimposed on the main display
(Fig  23)  Options  include  a request for landing or docking clearance and
sending   messages  to  others.   Some  will  provide  a  further  list  of
communications  ,for  example  Broadcast message to all in range....  which
allows  you  to send distress calls or demands for surrender.  You can also
contact the police and settle any outstanding fines by remote payment.  See
the  TRADING  section  on  page  55, the COMBAT section on page 35, and the
NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 11.

FORWARD AND REWIND ICONS
They  are  only  displayed when orbital maps are in use (see the NAVIGATION
AND FLIGHT section on page 11), and are used to show the position of bodies
at different points in time.  The simulated time is displayed at the bottom
left hand corner of the screen.

TIME CONTROL ICONS

These  allow  the  pilot  to  alter the apparent speed of time.  The single
arrow  means  real time and the arrows to the right increase the passage of
time  by 10 to 10,000 times.  The icon on the far left hand side is a pause
button  to  halt everything.  See the NAVIGATION AND FLlGHT section on page
11  and  the TRADING section on page 55.  The pilot should realise that his
enemies  are similarly sped up, so using these icons will only make a dodgy
problem worse.

THE WEAPON CONTROL PANEL
Call up the Weapon Control Panel (fig 26) by selecting the Scanner area.

Some  items  of  your  ships  equipment do not have icons because they work
automatically  Those  that  do  have an icon which needs to be activated in
order  for  them  to  function  are  illustrated in the grey boxes.  In the
bottom right hand corner of the icon, the letter for the keyboard short cut
is  shown.   The  separate icon guide lists the weapon and equipment icons.
See  also  the  COMBAT section on page 35 for details of use of weapons and
APPENDIX  ONE:   SHIPYARD  EQUIPMENT  on  page  69 for technical details of
weapons and equipment.


SECTION TWO:  NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT
===================================

NAVIGATION
----------

One part of your ship that is impressive is the Galactonav space navigation
facility,  built  in to all spacecraft.  You have a number of facilities at
your disposal by using the Map icons F2 (Fig 27 and Fig 28).

Those  icons  cycle  through two maps:  the map of the galaxy and a current
map  of the system in which you are travelling.  Depending on which map you
are  viewing  the  icons on the bottom right-hand side of your console have
different functions (see GALACTlC MAP ICON on page 5 and CURRENT SYSTEM MAP
ICON on page 7).

VIEWING THE GALAXY IN DETAIL USING THE GALACTIC MAP
---------------------------------------------------

Select  the Galactic Map icon F2 to obtain a map of all the star systems in
the  galaxy (Fig 29), thanks to the Galactic Survey of 2817.  The positions
of  all  100,000,000,000  stars  (approximately)  were  mapped  as  soon as
technology provided telescopes sophisticated enough to do the job.

A  grid  is drawn through the plane of the galaxy to aid visual orientation
and  provide  navigational  coordinates.   The  galaxy  is  divided up into
sectors.   Since  the  galaxy is thin and flat, sector coordinates are only
two  dimensional  with a sector measuring eight light years along each edge
and  containing  all  the  stars above and below it.  Sector boundaries are
shown  in bright green on the map, and their coordinates are given relative
to the Solar system for historical reasons.
 
From  Sol's  sector, 'east' and 'west' coordinates are represented by the
first  coordinate  'east'  being  a  positive and 'west' a negative number.
Similarly,  'north'  and `south` are represented by the second number, with
'north'  positive.   Up to nine sectors are displayed at once on the screen
and  the  coordinates  of  the  central  sector are displayed at the bottom
left-hand  corner.  Each star is shown coloured according to type (eg.  red
for  a red giant.  blue for a hot blue star) and with a line indicating its
height `above` or 'below` the galactic plane.

The  pink  lines  linking  systems are recommended trade routes in case you
feel  you  need  some  guidance  to  start with.  They were compiled by the
Zebulon Intergalactic Trading Corporation five years ago.

MOVING AROUND THE GRID

To  move  around  the grid, use the Arrow (Cursor) keys.  The system in the
centre  is  highlighed  in green and a small amount of information on it is
shown  on  the console.  The system you are currently travelling through is
highlighted in pink.

To  change  the  angle  of  the  grid  itself (Fig 3O), to see the relative
positions  of  systems  more clearly, hold down the right hand mouse button
and move the mouse.

You can zoom in and out with the Zoom icons F7 and F8

You can re-centre the map by pressing the C key.

MANIPULATING THE GALACTIC MAP

Once  familiar  with the grid, faster operation can be achieved by electing
to  discard certain features (Fig 31 and Fig 32).  Select the Tools icon F9
and  four  different  icons  become  available  which  enable you to adjust
certain features of the grid.

. The Stalk icon F7 will turn the distance lines on or off.

. The Grid icon F8 will turn the grid on or off.

. Trade icon F9 will turn the trade routes on or off.

. The  Identification  Text icon F10 will remove the incidental and other
  details like  Core System.

As  you  elect  to  do any one, the four icons disappear but can be brought
back again with the Tools icon F9.

OBTAINING DATA ON A SYSTEM

ASTRONOMICAL DATA

From  the  grid  map,  select the system you are interested in by using the
Arrow  (Cursor) keys to move it into the middle of the screen where it will
be highlighted in green

Use  the Data icon F6 and a schematic summary of all astronomical bodies in
the system will appear, if the system has been explored (Fig 33).

Use  the  mouse  to  pick  out  individual  bodies  on  which  you  require
geographical and physical data including:

Average surface temperature.

Major starports.

Orbital  period  (which  is  the  sidereal  period measured in Earth days).
Average orbital radius.

Orbital  eccentricity  and inclination, measured relative to the rotational
plane of the central body.

Clicking  away  from  the  text  returns  you  to  the general system data.
Alternatively click on another body.

If  you  want to return to the grid map of the galaxy, use the Data icon F6
again or the Galactic Map icon F2.

When  in  Data  mode  F6  the  icons  F7, F8 and F10 have new functions, as
follows:

DATA ON ECONOMY OF SELECTEO SYSTEM The Economy icon F7 gives a breakdown of
imports,  exports  and illegal goods.  Exports tend to be cheap and imports
expensive.

DATA  ON  SOCIAL  STRUCTURE  AND  COORDINATES  The  Political icon F8 gives
relevant  details  on  Government type, economy, allegiance and population.
Sector coordinates in the Galactic map are also given here.
 
CONFIGURATION OF ORBITS OF THE SELECTED SYSTEM While still in System Data
mode  F6 use of the Orbital map icon F10, will allow you to see the orbital
configuration  of  the  system  you selected (Fig 34), To alter the viewing
angle.  press the right-hand mouse button and move the mouse.

VIEWING  ORBITS  WITH RESPECT TO TIME The orbital map shows a `snapshot' of
the  positions  of bodies.  Select the Forward or Rewind icons on the right
hand  side  of  the screen to predict the position at different times.  The
time  and date shown at the bottom left hand side of the screen will change
The real time is displayed underneath it.
 
VIEWING A SPECIFIC BODY Click on a body which will then become central on
the screen and use the Zoom icons F7 and F8.

MANIPULATING THE SELECTED SYSTEM ORBITAL MAP

Select  the  Tools  icon  F9 and two different icons become available which
enable you to adjust the features of the grid.

The Orbital icon F9 removes or replaces the orbit lines.

The Information Text icon F10 removes or replaces the text on the screen.

To  get  out  of  the  Orbital  map,  use  the Map icon F2 to return to the
Galactic map.

THE GALACTIC VIEW 

This  feature can be used to get an idea of perspective.  While in Galactic
map  mode,  click on Galactic View icon F10 and a Creator's eye view of the
galaxy is shown (Fig 35).

At  maximum  zoom  (showing  500  light year scale) each pixel represents a
single  sector  To  zoom  in and out use the Zoom icons F7 and F8 (Fig 36).
Note that the resolution is best while not zooming.  When you stop zooming,
improvement  of the first, coarse picture is made as quickly as possible by
the on board computer.

The Galactic Map icon F10 can be used to return to the Galactic map.

USING THE CURRENT SYSTEM MAP
----------------------------
 
VIEWING THE CONFIGURATION OF ORBITS

1. Select the Map icon F2 twice and a map of the system you are currently
   in is displayed, showing the configuration of the orbits (Fig 37).

2. Zoom in and out with the Zoom icons F7 and F8. 

3. Alter the viewing angle by holding down the right-hand mouse button and
   moving the mouse as for the Galactic map.

VIEWING ORBITS WITH RESPECT TO TIME

The  orbital map shows a 'snapshot' of the positions of bodies.  Select the
Forward  or  Rewind  icons  on  the right of the view screen to predict the
positions  at  different  times.   The  time  and  date shown at the bottom
left-hand  side  of  the  screen  will  change.  The real time is displayed
underneath it.

VIEWING A SPECIFIC BODY

Click  on  a  body which will then become central on the screen and use the
Zoom icons F7 and F8

Note  that  the Autopilot can be targeted using the Current System map (see
the FLIGHT section on page 20).

MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM MAP

Select  the  Tools  icon  F9 and two different icons become available which
enable you to adjust certain features of the map.

The Orbital icon F9 will remove the Orbital paths.

The Information Text icon F10 will remove the names of the bodies.

OBTAINING PERMITS
-----------------

Some  systems, such as those with a prison colony, require visitors to have
permits  in  order to enter the system.  Any such requirements for a system
will be shown on the console when using the Galactic Map.

Permits  are  not  widely available and you will find that they can only be
obtained  indirectly.   This  means that you must do business involving the
system  in  question,  for example delivering a package, so that the client
must give you a permit.

FLIGHT
------

Your  ship  has three basic modes of flight:  Autopilot, Manual and Engines
Off  which  can  be  selected  by using the Flight Control icons F7 in View
mode.   The  Autopilot  is by far the easiest way to control your craft but
does  not  give  you  a  sense of achievement.  Manual flight may take some
getting  used  to, but is more rewarding.  Flying with engines off does not
get you very far, but has some advantages as you will see.

THE AUTOPILOT

This  most useful device, although not usually fitted as standard, has been
included  with  your  Eagle.   It can be bought and fitted at a shipyard if
ever  you  need  another  one.   Your  Autopilot,  the Robocruise automatic
navigation  system,  superseded  the  Celestial  Pathfinder  which was less
reliable.

The  Autopilot  can  only  be  used  to  select a destination in the system
through  which  you  are  currently  travelling.   For  longer  journeys, a
hyperspace jump needs to be made

OPERATING AUTOPILOT IN VIEW MODE

The Autopilot can only be used when in flight.

Whilst  in  a  View mode (use the View icon F1 if you are in another mode),
target  a planet or space station which is on the screen by clicking on the
centre  of  the  target Note that you will find it easier to find a target,
for  example,  a city, if the name is on screen.  If names have been turned
off, select the Identification Text icon F10.

Clicking  where  there  is  no  potential  target  deselects any previously
selected target.

When  a  target is selected a sight will come up with targeting squares and
the range in astronomical units or kilometres (Fig 38).  If the target goes
off  the  screen  an arrow will appear pointing in its direction.  If it is
behind then Target Behind is displayed.
 
Use  the  Flight Control icon F7 and cycle through Manual and Engines Off
to Autopiiot.

The Autopilot icon will only appear if a target is selected.

OPERATING AUTOPILOT IN CURRENT SYSTEM MAP MODE

This  mode  can  be used when the desired destination is too far away to be
visible.   A  target  can  be  selected even while landed or docked but the
Autopilot can only be engaged while in flight.

Use the Map icon F2 twice to obtain the Current System map.

Use  the  Current  System  map  controls  until  yon  can  see  the desired
destination on the screen

Click on  the Targeting icon F10.

Click on the centre of the desired destination (Fig 39).

If  you  wish  to  change  the  target,  click on the Targeting icon before
selecting another body.  Clicking on bodies without selecting the Targeting
icon will merely move that body to the centre of the screen.

If  you wish to deselect the target, click on an area which is blank.  This
will also disengage the Autopilot if it is currently in control.

Return  to  View  mode  using the View icon F1.  Targeting squares, looking
like  a  tunnel leading to the destination, will be visible, if in Front or
Rear View.

If  you  are  in  flight  click  on the Flight Control Icon F7 and cycle to
Autopilot to engage it.  To return to Manual flight, use the Flight Control
icon F7 and cycle to Manual or Engines Off.
 
The  Robocruise  will  automatically plot and maintain the course to your
destination.   It  will  also  lower the undercarriage and dock or land for
you,  having automatically asked for clearance, while you freshen up.  Some
pilots  find  it  disorientating when the Robocruise engages and swings the
ship  round.   The  true Spacehound knows that it is only locking on to the
new course.

Remember you can only trade and do business in cities or at space stations.
If you do land anywhere else the console will indicate Landed (Rough).

The  Robocruise really comes into its own when used in conjunction with the
Stardreamer  Time Control unit which is fitted as standard on all ships due
to  regulations  regarding Wilbron's psychosis.  This condition is known to
afflict  the  space  traveller  who  endures  lengthy, uneventful journeys.
Boredom  becomes  so intense after all leisure pursuits have been exhausted
that  pilots have been known to fly their craft into the odd star or planet
just to liven things up a bit.

USING  THE STARDREAMER TIME CONTROL 
This  can  be  used  with the Robocruise or in Manual flight.  Use the Time
Control icons (after targeting your destination if using the Robocruise) to
select the rate of time acceleration.  Time appears to increase in steps of
ten  from  ten times to ten thousand times, depending on the icon selected.
Return to real time by selecting the single arrow.

Sit  back and a combination of a Zilman field and ultrasonic waves induce a
semi- hypnotic state which renders you unaware of the passage of time other
than  seeing  the  range  indicator  change  rapidly in front of you.  This
effect  was  discovered  by  Dr  Rabbne by accident when he revised why his
projects  were  running over time for no apparent reason.  Reassuringly, if
your  ship  is  attacked or hailed or you have arrived at your destination,
the  Stardreamer  will  restore  you  to  full consciousness and real time.
Don't forget that your enemies may be operating in real time and hence will
seem to be sped up enormously.

HYPERSPACE JUMPS
----------------

Space is BIG and hyperspace jumps are necessary to access different systems
quickly.   Hyperspace jumps can be made using either Standard Hyperdrive or
Military Hyperdrive engines which can be bought at the Shipyard and come in
different  sizes  with  varying  ranges.   Refer to APPENDlX ONE:  SHIPYARD
EQUIPMENT on page 69 for a description of them.

A  hyperspace jump causes a disturbance resulting in a glowing field at the
entry  and  exit  points.   A  Hyperspace  Cloud Analyser can determine the
destination  of  the jumping ship (See APPENDIX ONE:  SHIPYARD EQUIPMENT on
page 69) Before attempting your first jump, it is recommended that you read
the whole of this section.

RANGE

The  range  of the jump is determined by two things:  fuel and the type and
class  of  engine.   Details  of these are given in the TRADING section for
fuel  on  page 55 and APPENDIX ONE:  SHlPYARD EQUIPMENT for engines on page
74.   Briefly the engines range depends on its class as well as the size of
the ship.

Engine ranges are displayed in two ways:

On the Inventory page select the Inventory icon F8 until the Ship Equipment
appears where the engine's range will be given.

On  the  Galactic map (Galactic Map icon F2, displayed in the panel, to the
right  of  the  system  name.   If  your engine is not up to jumping to the
destination selected, the mssage Out of Range will be given.

Fuel range is shown in two ways:

The  amount  of fuel required for a jump is displayed at the bottom left of
the  Galactic  map.   If  you have insufficient fuel then Insufficient Fuel
will also be displayed otherwise the fuel which will be used will be shown.

On  the  Galactic  map,  a  pink  circle  will  surround the system you are
currently  in  and this shows your maximum range for hyperspace in a single
jump.

JUMP DURATION

Although the perceived duration of a jump is very short, the actual time is
much greater It takes a week to make the maximum range jump for any engine.
For  example  an  engine  with a maximum range of 1O lightyears will take a
week  to  jump  that far or 3.5 days for a 5 light year jump, and so on.  A
ship with a maximum hyperspace jump range of 4 light years will take half a
week  to jump only 2 light years.  This has implications for piracy because
a  pirate  ship  with  a  Hyperspace  Cloud Analyser and a lighter ship can
'overtake' you and lie in wait.  Contact in Hyperspace is not possible.

HYPERSPACE OPERATION

Target  a  system  using  the  Galactic  Map icon.  by placing the required
destination in the centre of the screen with the Arrow (Cursor) keys.  That
system becomes highlighted in green.

Return to View mode using the View icon F1.

Select  the  Hyperspace icon F8 (it will not show if you have no hyperspace
facility  or  a valid jump is not selected) and cross your fingers.  If you
like  you  can set your destination.  go about your business and be able to
make  a  quick  exit at any time if things hot up a bit.  Alternatively, if
you  use  the H key you can make your jump (Fig 40) without going into View
mode first.

Remember  that  the  evidence  of  your  hyperspace jump will be visible to
anybody  in the vicinity of your exit or entry, as it leaves a glowing area
of  disturbance  in  space.  The destination can only be ascertained with a
Hyperspace Cloud Analyser, available at shipyards.
 
There  are  a  number  of reasons why the Hyperspace icon may not appear,
they are as follows:

You  are too close to a planet.  Regulations were laid down after the first
few  decades  of  hyperspace  jumping.   Sudden above average recordings of
mutations around starports occurred a few years after jumps became routine.
It  was  discovered  that  the  intense  radiation  caused  by the jump was
affecting  the  population  below.   It became a requirement by law (on all
sides)  that all ships have a cutout system built into the Hyperdrive which
is activated if you try to jump from near to a planet or space station.

A valid destination is not selected.

You do not have enough fuel for a jump to the selected destination.

Engine is damaged or destroyed.

You don't have a Hyperdrive engine!

MIS-JUMPS

Hyperdrives  almost  never  go  wrong, but if you are unfortunate enough to
suffer  a  spontaneous misjump, you can get into serious trouble.  You will
emerge  somewhere  other than your planned destination, which may be out of
range  for your remaining fuel.  It is even possible to mis-jump beyond the
maximum  range  of your drive.  If indeed your fuel reserves are too low or
the Hyperdrive is broken, your only hope is to call for help (Communication
icon  F4)  and  risk pirates responding.  It is not entirely understood why
mis-jumps  happen  but an unserviced Hyperdrive is a likely culprit.  There
are  no  reliable  statistics  available on the occurrences of mis-jumps as
most  ships  are  never  found.  A missing ship could just as easily be the
result of piracy.

FORCED MIS-JUMPS

Faulcon  De  Lacey  do not condone this practice as it has an unpredictable
effect  on  the  Hyperdrive.   It  is  the  equivalent of blindly jamming a
screwdriver  into  the  works.   We feel that it needs to be mentioned as a
warning  because  foolish  pilots  do  use  it  as  a last resort to escape
pirates.   If  they  are  being  pursued  by  a  larger  pirate ship with a
Hyperspace  Cloud  Analyser  they  force a mis-jump by pressing the Alt key
while  activating  the  Hyperspace  icon or the F8 key.  The pirates follow
them  into  hyperspace only to find that their quarry is nowhere to be seen
and is in fact somewhere else, frantically trying to work out exactly where
they are.  The Hyperspace Cloud Analyser cannot distinguish a mis-jump from
a normal jump.

WASTE PRODUCTS

Unfortunately,  the  convenience  of hyperspace travel is blighted with the
problem  of  waste products if you use military fuel.  Due to the processes
in  the  Hyperdrive, every tonne of military fuel is converted to one tonne
of  radioactives which you will need to dispose of on the stockmarket.  See
APPENDIX  TWO:   TRADE  ITEMS  on  page  77 for more information.  Standard
Hyperdrive  engines  powered  by  hydrogen  fuel do not produce problematic
waste products.

USING MANUAL CONTROL 
--------------------

Due  to the marked improvement of engineering technology the engines of the
craft  are  not  controlled  by  the  pilot  directly,  but by the on-board
computer  in  response  to  the pilot This fly by wire facility has enabled
many to take to the cockpit who would not have had the skill to do so.

The  main  problem  for  beginners  is  that they are usually accustomed to
driving  surface  based  vehicles  in reasonable gravity, or have only used
poor  quality  space  flight simulators.  What needs to be borne in mind is
that when direction is changed, the experience is rather like skidding.  If
your ship is travelling in one direction changing course will mean that the
nose  will  turn  but  you  still  have  momentum in the direction you were
originally going.  The engines will compensate for this but there is a lag,
the  duration  of  which  will depend on the type of ship.  For example the
response  rate of a fighter will be faster than that of a heavy cargo ship.
This must be borne in mind at all times.

FUEL CONSUMPTION

Normal  flight  consumes  much less fuel than hyperspace jumps and for that
reason  fuel for this purpose is kept separately in an engine tank from the
hyperspace  fuel  (kept  in the hold).  Class 1 Engines hold one tonne, and
Class  2 Engines hold two tonnes.  You do not need to refill very often and
the  current  level  can be seen on the green gauge (left most of three) in
the  dials  area,  to the right of the scanner.  See INVENTORY ICONS in the
ICON  section on page 8, and THE SHIP`S INVENTORY in the TRADING section on
page 60.

REFILLING THE ENGINE FUEL TANK

Spare  fuel  for  refilling  the  engine tank is carried in the hold in one
tonne units.

To  refuel  the  engine  tank,  select the Inventory icon F3 until the Ship
Equipment  page  is  displayed.  (Refuelling is done automatically with the
Auto Refueller fitted.)

Click  on  the Refuel button to transfer the fuel into the engine tank from
the hold.

If  the  engine  tank  only  needs one third of a tonne, two thirds will be
wasted as the hold tank transfers units of one tonne only.

CONTROLS IN FLIGHT

TO  MAKE  THE  SHIP  DIVE Use the A key, push the joystick shaft forward or
move the mouse forwards while holding down the right-hand mouse button.

TO  MAKE THE SHIP CLIMB Use the Z key, pull the joystick shaft back or move
the mouse backwards while holding down the right-hand mouse button.

TO  GO  LEFT Use the < key, move the joystick left or move the mouse to the
left while holding down the right hand mouse button.

TO  GO RIGHT Use the > key move the joystick right or move the mouse to the
right while holding down the right hand mouse button.

Note that when flying with your engines off, the front and rear engines may
be controlled using the Enter and Shift keys respectively.

THE FRONT SCREEN

In  Front View mode (see page 3 for a reminder) you will see two crosses on
your  screen,  One  is a gun sight cross (Fig 47) which shows which way you
are  facing, and the other is a diagonal cross, the velocity sight (Fig 48)
which  indicates  the  direction in which you are travelling.  When the two
are  in line (Fig 49) it means that you are moving in the direction you are
pointing.   If  they  are  separate,  it means that your velocity is in the
direction  of  the  diagonal cross and you are pointing in the direction of
the  gun sight because, for example, you have suddenly changed course.  you
will  hear  the  engines  fire until alignment is achieved, You may see the
velocity  sight  disappear  when your direction of travel is not within the
area  of  the  screen if, for example, you veer wildly and the engines have
not yet compensated enough.

To  summarise,  the  gun  sight  shows  the  orientotion of the ship and is
controlled  by  the  pilot,  the  velocity sight indicates the direction of
travel and is controlled by the on- board computer.

Your  ship's  internal  gyros  enable  it to rotate, much like those in the
ancient  Earth  satellites,  good  examples  of  which are now in the space
museum  in  Apollonius  City  on the Moon.  While greatly superior now, the
gyros still have a limit to the rate at which you can turn, so don't expect
to  spin  'on a sixpence' (small coin used in Britain on Earth, about 1,200
years ago).

SPEED

Speed  is  controlled  with the Return key to accelerate and the right-hand
Shift  key  to  decelerate.   Two speed values are displayed on the screen:
Set speed and Actual speed (Fig 50).  The first is the requested speed, set
by  the  keys  above  and  the  second  is  the  speed relative to the most
important body in your vicinity.  This important body can be a planet, star
or a space station or very large spaceship, and is selected by the on board
computer.   If  you  fly  away  from  it  and  the computer then designates
another, the actual speed will change, as will the velocity.

You  will notice that the velocity sight will move as the on-board computer
adjusts  your  speed  relative to the new body.  For those who are happy to
point  your ship at something and go, this is all you need to know.  Pilots
wishing  to be accomplished in flight theory should refer to APPENDlX FOUR:
THE MECHANlCS OF SPACE FLIGHT on page 91.

ALTITUDE

An altitude reading in metres will be displayed on the screen when in close
proximity  to  a  planet  or  star.   It  will give your distance above the
average ground height of the body (Fig 50).

LAUNCHING
---------

SURFACE TAKE OFF

A  warning sign is shown over the Take Off icon if permission to launch has
not been granted.  If you are landed anywhere other than a starport (Landed
Rough)  you  do  not  need  to ask for clearance.  If you are in a starport
select the Communication icon F4 followed by Launch Request.

In  View mode, activate the Right Control icon F7 for take off.  This gives
you vertical thrust.  The console will display Take Off.

This  can  seem  quite  slow so a faster ascent can be made if you tilt the
nose  up once you have left the ground and increase your Set speed with the
Enter key.  Using the rear view will display a pleasing panorama.

Once  you  have  used forward thrust, the vertical thrust is turned off and
the console will display Manual Control.

Bear  in  mind that gravity will always pull you back down.  If you wish to
fly in the atmosphere you must give the ship some lift by pointing the nose
up slightly thereby providing a small vertical component to the thrust.

LAUNCH FROM A DOCK

Activate the Commuication icon F4 and select Launch Request.

Accelerate forwards using the Enter key.

You must leave the area promptly because your clearance expires.

RUNNING WITH ENGINES OFF

If  you are economising, turning off the engines has obvious advantages and
your  engine  flares  wil  not  be  visible  to  your enemies.  It can make
manoeuvring  easier when strafing a target.  For example you can aim to fly
across  a  target and turning off the engines means you can point at it, go
sideways  and  shoot  without the engines firing to propel you forward into
it.   Experienced  pilots  often use this mode in combat, using the forward
and reverse thrusters (Enter and Shift).

SLING SHOT ORBITS

This  technique  for gaining speed was important in the early days of space
flight,  but now it is unecessary due to advances in space technology.  The
only  reasons  to  do this are because it can be visually pleasing to sweep
past a planet or sun so that you can say you`ve done it.  A sling shot uses
to  your  benefit  the  gravity of large bodies to 'sling` your ship in the
direction of its travel.  Your engines need to be turned off otherwise they
will compensate for any effect and it saves fuel as well.

LOSS OF ENGINES

If an engine is disabled, the Autopilot will not function properly and only
very experienced pilots will be able to fly the ship manually.

LANDING AND DOCKING
-------------------

LANDING MANUALLY AT A CITY WITH A BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE (AN OUTDOOR CITY)

Executing a manual landing will require practice, so try it in a relatively
safe  area.  You may find it easier to use External View to align the ship.
Remember  though  that the ship will appear to be stationary and the ground
will  seem  to  move.   You  may  also find it helpful to use the targeting
squares,  obtained  by  setting  your  destination  as  a  target  (see THE
AUTOPILOT section on page 20 or the TARGETlNG section on page 36).

Normally  the Autopilot flies to an area 20km above the target and descends
vertically.   You  can  set  the controls to Manual flight using the Flight
Control  icon F7 at any point in this operation.  Alternatively you can fly
the entire approach and land manually (Fig 41).

The  easiest  method  is  to  make  a  pass over the port while waiting for
clearance   (Communication   icon   F4)   and  lowering  the  undercarriage
(Undercarriage  icon  F9).   If  the undercarriage has not been lowered you
will  crash land.  When you have been told which landing pad to use, aim to
be  more  or  less  at  zero  speed when you come to rest above it.  If you
select  Engines Off, gravity will take you down, with the on board computer
stabilising  the  ship.   If there is little or no gravity, you may have to
thrust slightly with the nose down to start with, but be careful.

LANDING AT A CITY WITH NO BREATHABLE ATMOSPHERE

Follow  the  same  guide  lines  as  for  an outdoor city with a breathable
atmosphere.   The  only  difference  is the appearance of the landing area,
covered with a hexagonal airlock door (Fig 42).  When clearance is granted,
the aperture will open to reveal the landing pad.  Don`t ask for permission
too  early  or  you  will find that the clearance will be withdrawn and the
airlock  shut.   Again, the targeting squares may be helpful by providing a
'tunnel' through which you can fly (see THE AUTOPILOT section on page 20 or
the TARGETlNG section on page 36).

DOCKING AT A SPACE STATION

Request  permission  for docking (Communication icon F4) and wait until the
red  flashing  light turns white and orange homing lights are visible it is
illegal  to  approach prematurely.  The on board computer matches your roll
with  that of the station so you do not have to make difficult calculations
in  order  to  dock.   Position the ship immediatly in front of the docking
entrance  and  proceeding  slowly  (Fig  43).   The  dock`s vechicle arrest
mechanisnm will halt the craft provided your speed is not excessive.


SECTION THREE COMBAT
====================


USING YOUR WEAPONS
------------------

Welcome  to  the  manual!   (in case this is the first page you have turned
to).

While  Faulcon  de  Lacy  do  not  condone  offensive  combat,  it is often
unavoidable.   The  best  defence  is always to run away if at all possible
(though  many cultures reject this as cowardly).  Combat is very dangerous,
and rarely ends up without expensive repairs being necessary.

Weapons  (like  missiles) may be controlled via the Weapon Control Panel of
your  ship  (Fig  52) which may be selected by clicking on the scanner area
with the left hand mouse button, or pressing the F5 key.

This  display replaces the scanner display (if fitted).  The scanner may be
restored by clicking on the area again (away from any icons) or by pressing
the  F5  key.   It  should  be borne in mind that keyboard shortcuts to the
Weapon  Control  Panel icons can still be used even if the Control Panel is
not currently selected.

As  additional  weapons  and equipment are fitted to your ship, their icons
appear  along  the  bottom  of the panel.  The icon boxes will remain blank
until you have obtained the equipment.  As you buy missiles and mines, they
will  be  illustrated  next  to  the  icon  boxes  as  shown  above.  It is
recommended  that you read APPENDIX ONE:  SHIPYARD EQUIPMENT on page 69 for
more technical information before buying anything.

TARGETING  
Targeting is used for both long range navigation (see the NAVlGATION FLIGHT
section on page 11) and combat.  One target can be set at a time.

Using  the screen in Front, Rear, External or Turret View mode F1, click on
the centre of the ship to be targeted.

If  you  are  in  external or Turret View a sight on the target will appear
together with the range (Fig 53).

If  you  are in Front or Rear View you will be presented with the Targeting
Tunnel  on  your headup display (Fig 54).  This is displayed as a series of
contracting  squares along the path to the target, and looks like a tunnel.
The range of the target is given in Astronomical Units AU or kilometres km.
Targeting  Tunnels  are  not  normally  shown  for  ships  as  they  can be
confusing.  They may be enabled by using the 'Preferences'.

In  order to pursue the ship you fly down the tunnel.  As you get closer to
the target the squares will be shown closer together, thus the squares will
come  towards  you faster.  If you are approaching a stationary target then
ideally the squares should pass at a constant rate, as you slow down on the
final approach.

If the target goes off screen an arrow will indicate the direction in which
it lies, or, if it is behind your ship, Target Behind will show.

To  deselect  the  target,  click  on  a blank area that is not a potential
target.

You  may  also  select  another  target  at any time by clicking on another
object

Some  pilots  may  find the 'tunnel' an annoyance.  If you are one of these
refer to the Preferences sheet supplied separately from this manual.

OFFENSIVE WEAPONS
-----------------

Quite  often,  the best form of defence is attack, hence Faulcon de Lacy do
provide  what may be considered offensive weapons.  It should be made clear
that they should only be used in a defensive capacity against an attacker -
Faulcon de Lacy in no way condone any other use.

PULSE LASERS AND BEAM LASERS
One  laser (or other gun) can be mounted at the front of your ship and, for
ships  with a rear mounting, one at the rear.  Some larger ships are fitted
with turret, which can each take a single weapon.  There is a wide range to
choose  from  (see  APPENDIX  ONE:  SHIPYARD EQUIPMENT section on page 69),
though  the full range will only be available at the biggest shipyards.  It
is  rumoured  that  the  military  of  both sides have developed additional
weapons for their own use, but this is usually denied.

A  Pulse  Laser  fires a single high energy pulse about once every 5/8 of a
second,  while  a  Beam  Laser  fires  a  continuous  beam,  so is far more
devastating.   Even  small lasers are reasonably effective up to 8km range,
but  their  effectiveness  decreases  with  distance,  as  the beam spreads
slightly.  It is recommended that you get your shots in at as short a range
as possible, for maximum efficiency.

Beware  of laser reflections from certain types of surface, especially when
at  a  glancing  angle, Though the beam may have lost much of its energy it
can  still  cause  serious  damage.  There are also words that the Imperial
Navy  are  developing  reflective  armour, which reflects much of a laser's
energy back along the incoming path, though this is strongly denied.

OPERATING PULSE OR BEAM LASERS

Lasers  are  fired by pressing both mouse buttons together, the Spacebar on
the  keyboard  or the fire button on the joystick.  The front mounted laser
will  fire if you are in Front View mode F1, the rear laser if in Rear View
mode,  and  the  appropriate turret laser if in a Turret View mode.  If you
are in External View, then the front laser will be used irrespective of any
other lasers fitted.

It is quite common for lasers to overheat, particularly with more excitable
pilots  and  with the higher power beam lasers.  It is unlikely you will do
your laser any damage by this as it is protected by an automatic cut out to
prevent it burning out, but it may stop working for a few seconds.

LASER COOLING BOOSTER

This  reduces  the  problem of lasers overheating at that vital moment.  It
supplements  the  built in cooling system of your currently selected laser,
causing it to cool more rapidly.  It does not affect Plasma Accelerators.

USING MISSILES

If  you  want  a  quiet  life,  be  careful  who  or what you use as target
practice.   When  the  time  comes  to use one of these devices, proceed as
follows:

Arm  the  missile  of  your choice by clicking on one of the missile icons.
The  console will show the type of missile or mine you have armed.  You can
arm  only  one  missile  at  a  time  so  if you click again on a different
missile, you will be arming that one and disarming the previous one.

A  Fire  icon  also appears.  Clicking on this or pressing the M key on the
keyboard  fire  the  armed  missile  at your target, but it is important to
remember that you can only firew if a target has been selected.

Disarming  is  simply  achieved  by  clicking on the missile in question or
clicking on an another weapon.

All  types  of  missile will home in on their selected target as rapidly as
their  incredible  65g  acceleration  ZX34  Short  Burn  engine will allow.
Nevertheless they have limited fuel (enough for about one minute of flight)
so  pilots do sometimes evade them.  It is best to fire the missile from as
close  to  the target as you dare.  Ideally while facing it.  If the target
is  behind,  the  missile  will  turn  around, but this will waste precious
flight time, and give the target ship more time to use ECM if it has it.

The  missile  will detonate on hitting any solid object (including the ship
that  fired  it)  but  will  attempt  to  avoid  such non target objects if
possible.  It does not need to hit the target in order to detonate - it may
detonate  in  close  proximity  and  do  almost  as much damage.  Due to an
international  treaty  it  will  also detonate when it runs out of fuel.  A
small village was once destroyed by a missile which had been flying through
space for months, following the battle in which it was fired.

USING MINES

Mines  operate just like missiles, but without drive systems.  They need to
have  an  assigned target since they also will detonate in the proximity of
that  target without necessarily hitting it.  Mines are also susceptible to
detonation  by  ECM.   Dummy  Mines are a relatively recent innovation, and
still  contain  machinery  internally  in  order to fool radar scans, hence
their  weight.   They are also visually indistinguishable from normal mines
so,  although  they are safe to scoop back up again, beware of accidentally
scooping  a  live  mine  instead,  as  the scoop mechanism will cause it to
detonate.

ENERGY  BOMB  
Generally  only of use against smaller ships.  This causes the main reactor
of  all  small  ships'  drive  systems  (within  a range of about 100km) to
resonate  and overload.  it is linked to the drive of the ship using it, so
will  not  cause that to detonate.  Operated with the Energy Bomb icon (Fig
56) on the Weapon Control Panel, or from the keyboard with the B key.

LARGE AND SMALL PLASMA ACCELERATOR

These  are  very large weapons, usually carried by large naval cruisers and
battlestations,  and  are  sometinmes  carried  by  large trading ships and
passenger  liners in the more dangerous regions of space.  They are used in
the same way as lasers and take up a gun mounting.  After firing, they take
a few seconds to recharge.  Two sizes are commonly available, imaginatively
named  'Large' and 'Small'.  Even a Small Plasma Accelerator will destroy a
well  armed  hundred  tonne ship with a single shot.  The large version has
been  known  to  be used as a planetary assault weapon, destroying selected
areas  of  cities  from  orbit.  This has a devastating effect on the local
population,  because  the  terrifying noise of the beam cutting through the
atmosphere  can be heard for hundreds of kilometres, and will deafen anyone
unprotected in the vicinity.

DEFENSIVE AND OTHER EOUIPMENT
-----------------------------

ECM SYSTEM

This  destroys all active Mines and Homing Missiles in the vicinity (within
about  100km)  It  is  operated  with  the ECM icon from the Weapon Control
Panel, or with the E key from the keyboard.  Do not be alarmed if it causes
interference on your main display.

NAVAL ECM SYSTEM

A superior version of the standard ECM system, which can also destroy Smart
Missiles  and  has  a  greater  range  (about  200km).  This may also cause
interference  on  your  main  display.  This is operated with the Naval ECM
icon from the Weapon Control Panel, or with the E key.  If both ECM systems
are  fitted,  then  Naval  ECM  is  used  in  preference.   The only slight
advantage  in  having  both  systems fitted is that if the Naval ECM breaks
down or is destroyed, then you can use the standard unit.

AUTOMATIC HULL SEALING

All  hulls  have an automatic sealing system, fitted as standard, thanks to
Faulcon  Hermeseal.   It is comprised of two separate layers of resin under
high  pressure  in  the  hull.  When the layers are breached the substances
expand  and  mix  to form a very durable foam likepatch.  This prevents the
whole hull being explosively decompressed from a single shot.

HULL AUTOMATIC REPAIR SYSTEM

This  gradually completely reverses hull damage, but it is so big that only
larger  ships  can  have one fitted.  See APPENDIX ONE:  SHIPYARD EQUIPMENT
section on page 73.

SHIELD GENERATOR

This  will  protect against energetic weapons like lasers and missiles.  It
is not much good with collisions.  If a ship that has a Shield Generator is
hit  by a weapon, the field will glow in a colour depending on the strength
of the shield.  At full charge, the field will glow a bluish white but will
progress  through  to  yellow,  orange and finally red as it is discharged.
While  the  shield  is  active, no damage will get through to the hull.  If
your  ship  has  shields, they work automatically and the percentage of the
charge  remaining if not 100 per cent, will be indicated on the top left of
the  screen.   More  than  one  shield Generator may be fitted to a ship at
once, and their shielding effect is additive.

ENERGY BOOSTER UNIT

This  large  unit  increases  the rate that all Shield Generators currently
fitted  to  your  ship  recharge.  Only recommended for larger ships with a
large number of Shield Generators because of its size.

TACTICS AND PLANNING
--------------------

It is vital to know what your enemy is up to, so you can avoid getting into
combat with them.  There are several different ways of doing this.

CHECKING UP ON THE COMPETITION

USING THE SCANNER 
This  device,  usually  provided as standard by Faulcon de Lacey, shows the
relative  positions  of  ships  and  other  objects  in your vicinity.  The
holographic  display  shows  the  other  objects as coloured blobs above or
below  the  plane  of  your ship, with a coloured line drawn to that plane.
The  plane of your ship is shown as a red circle with a grid on it (seen in
perspective  when viewed from the pilot's seat), with two lines drawn on it
to  show the extremity of your front view.  The colour of the blob reflects
the mass of the ship or object.

BLUE      1- 15t
GREEN    16- 31t
MAGENTA  32- 63t
RED      64-111t
ORANGE  112-159t
YELLOW  160-207t
GREY    208-299t
WHITE   300t+

USING THE RADAR MAPPER 
This  provides  you  with additional information about your current target,
such as the number of Shield Generators it has fitted, their current charge
level, the ship's maximum hyperspace range and any important equipment such
as  Energy  Bombs and Hyperspace Cloud Analyser.  It will also check if the
ship  matches  any  on  the  Wanted Criminals list, and if so will show any
bounty  that  is  offered.   This  bounty  will  be  paid into your account
automatically,  when  the  destruction  of  the  ship  is  recorded by your
on-board  computer.   No bounty will be paid for a ship if the Radar Mapper
has not first identified it, since proof of identity is needed

To operate the Radar Mapper:

Make sure you are in View mode by using the View icon F1.

Target  a  ship by clicking on it using the left hand mouse button.  If the
selected target is not a ship then no information will be shown.

Select  the  Radar  Mapper  icon  (Fig 60) on the Weapons Control Panel and
information  will  be displayed at the top right of the headup display (Fig
61) on your target until the Radar Mapper is deselected.

To deselect this facilicy, use the icon again.

To  deselect  the  target,  click  away  from  the  ship  where there is no
potential target.

USING THE HYPERSPACE CLOUD ANALYSER 
This  device  is  commonly  used  by pirates to identify the destination of
their  quarry,  and also by police forces and bounty hunters.  If your ship
has  a greater hyperspace range than the one you are chasing (use the Radar
Mapper  and your Ship Equipment Inventory page to determine this), then you
will arrive at the destination before them if you left at the same time.
 
It  gives their hyperspace destination, the ship's mass is also shown and
the exact Galactic Mean Time and date at which they will arrive.

Make sure you are in View mode by using the View icon F1.

Target  a  hyperspace  remnant  by clicking on it using the left hand mouse
button.   If  the  selected  target  is  not  a  hyperspace remnant then no
information will be shown.

Select  the  Hyperspace Cloud Analyser icon (Fig 62) on the Weapons Control
Panel and information will be displayed at the top right hand corner of the
headup display until the Hyperspace Cloud Analyser is deselected.

To deselect this facility, use the icon again.

To  deselect  the  target,  click  away  from  the  ship  where there is no
potential target.

To  follow  the  ship,  use  the  Galactic  Map icon F2 to jump to the same
destination  (see the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 11), As long as
you  enter  hyperspace  not  too long after your quarry then you will leave
hyperspace at a similar position.

Once  out  of  hyperspace,  use  the  Stardreamer  Time  Control  (see  the
NAVIGATION  AND FLlGHT section on page 22) to wait until the likely time of
arrival of your quarry.  The Hyperspace Cloud Analyser information is quite
accurate,  so  if  the  predicted time has been exceeded by about a minute,
then  your  quarry  will  not  arrive.   They must have mis-jumped (whether
intentionally or not) and there is no way you can find them.

BROADCASTING MESSAGES

While  in  flight you can hail other ships using the Communication icon F4.
A  range  of  messages  for  broadcasting  will be presented on your headup
display  (Fig  64).   For  example  you  can  demand  surrender  if you are
fortunate  enough  to  be  in  such  a  position.   If  your ship is on the
receiving  end  of  aggression  you can call for assistance, but there is a
risk some pirates listen for a call of distress and will home in on it like
a  spider  to  a fly.  If you have broken down the dilemma is the same, but
calling for help may be the only option open to you.

MAKING A RUN FOR IT

You  will  discover that there are many bigger and more heavily armed ships
than  yours  and  a ship to ship fight may be foolish.  Faulcon De Lacey do
not  advocate  illegal evasive measures and feel that going down in a blaze
of  glory  is more memorable for your loved one than a prison sentence.  If
posthumous praise is not appealing, an escape capsule could be your answer.

ESCAPE CAPSULES 
An  escape  capsule is not fitted as standard and needs to be obtained from
the  shipyard.   It  is  not  a  capsule as such but is a modification that
allows   your   cockpit   section   to  break  off  as  a  separate  craft.
Unfortunately  leaving  any  crew  members passengers and cargo behind.  It
flies  to  the nearest starport under a cut down Autopilot, and can be used
only  once.   For  this  reason, it comes with an insurance policy which is
automatically  cashed  in  for  a basic Eagle Long Range Fighter to replace
your abandoned ship.

The  capsule  has  no weapons or hyperspace facility.  You may ask why your
enemy  isn`t  going  to shoot at you.  It is considered to be extremely bad
form  to  shoot at escape capsules because they are much too easy a target,
and  most  pilots  realise  that some day they may need to use one.  It has
been known though, that some pilots are not bothered by image and will pick
you  off  anyway.  Another problem is ships scooping up escape capsules and
selling  the  occupant into slavery.  This is severely frowned upon by both
the  Elite  Federation of Pilots and the Federation itself.  To release the
capsule,  you  select the Escape Capsule icon on the Weapons Control Panel,
or use the X key on the keyboard.

HYPERSPACE 
Jumping  into  hyperpace is often sufficient to evade pirates, but a pirate
with  a fast ship may use their Hyperspace Cloud Analyser to chase you into
hyperspace  and,  if  they  have  a  faster  ship,  may even arrive at your
destination before you do.

ILLEGAL AND RISKY PRACTICES 
You  may  notice others committing offences in order to remain alive and we
feel  compelled to explain their erroneous behaviour in order to discourage
you  from copying them.  One tactic is the highly risky Hyperspace Mis-jump
and  this  can  be  found  in the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 25.
Another  is to jettison cargo in the hope that any ship following will give
up  the  chase  in  order  to  scoop it up.  This is explained in the TRADE
section on page 59.  Remember it is illegal to jettison any cargo.

COMBAT AND SERVICE RATINGS
--------------------------

ELITE RATING

Your  rating  as a pilot is displayed if you use the Inventory icon F3, and
cycle through to Commander Profile (Fig 66).

You  are  given  a  rating  by  the  Elite  Federation  of  Pilots which is
calculated  from  the  number  and  type  of kills recorded by the on board
computer.   For  example,  shooting  up  a heavily armed ship will a mass a
large  number  of points.  Many have disapproved of using kills in order to
calculate  this  rating  as it can lead to illegality.  In older times much
store  was  set  by  this  as  you  had  to be able to fight to survive, so
shooting  down  others  was  seen  as  a  mark of skill and bravery.  Great
respect is still held for the rating in the outer systems, where the way of
life  still  reflects  that  of  the past of the inner, now more civilised,
systems.   For  historical reasons therefore, the method of rating has been
preserved.  The categories are as follows, in order of merit:

ELITE RATINGS

Harmless           Above Average
Mostly Harmless    Competent
Poor               Dangerous
Below Average      Deadly
Average            ELITE

MEDALS

If  homicide is not your scene, medals are awarded by the Federation or the
Empire   for   particularly   heroic  deeds.   Medals  include  the  humble
Certificate  of  Valour and the highly respected Imperial Celestial Warrior
medal.   These  are  also  shown  on  the  Commander  Profile  page  of the
Inventory.

MILITARY RANK

Both  the  Federation  and  the  Empire  give  military  ranks for services
rendered  although  these are known as titles in the Empire.  An individual
can  gradually  progress  up the ranks even from purely mercenary missions,
receiving  promotions  after  sustained loyal service.  Usually these ranks
are  mutually  exclusive  as  each of the superpowers does not tolerate its
officers  working  for  the  other  power  (though work for the independant
worlds is usually allowed).

FEDERAL RANKS                          IMPERIAL TITLES
None            Lieutenant             Outsider         Viscount
Private         Lieutenant Commander   Serf             Count
Corporal        Captain                Master           Earl
Sergeant        Commodore              Sir              Marquis
Sergeant Major  Rear Admiral           Squire           Duke
Major           Admiral                Lord             Prince
Colonel                                Baron

LEGAL RATING

Before you start shooting at everything that moves in order to improve your
rating  consider  your legal status.  Data is collected by the three police
forces:   The  Federal  Security  Service (of the Federation), the Imperial
Guard  (of the Empire) and interpol (that of the Independent Systems).  The
latter  was  set  up  after the Federation and Empire became established as
superpowers,  and  the world leaders that wished to remain free of both got
together and decided to set up their own police force.  This was largely to
avoid  the  independent  worlds  becoming  a  dumping ground for criminals.
Remember  what you do and who you work for will almost certainly be noticed
by someone.


SECTION FOUR THE SHIPYARD
=========================


SHOPPING FOR SHIPS AND PARTS
----------------------------

The  shipyard  on any planet or station is where you can contact the police
to  pay  any  outstanding  fines or buy equipment for your ship, have parts
fitted  and  removed,  repairs  made  or even part exchange your ship.  The
range  on offer depends where you are, so you may have to shop around.  For
example  a  low  population  area  is not going to have a vast selection of
hardware  for  your  ship.   Having used the Communications icon F4, select
Shipyard and you will be presented with a list of services (Fig 67).

UPGRADING THE SHIP OR REMOVING PARTS FOR CASH

Click on Upgrades.  The screen will show items for sale with options to Fit
or Remove them and the prices for doing so (Fig 68).

Select  Fit or Remove buttons for the item of interest, and your cash total
at the bottom left of the screen will change accordingly.

If  the  complete  list  of  available items is too long to be shown in its
entirety, use the More...  arrows to look through it.

Use  of  the  Go  Back...   button  will return you to the Shipyard and the
Communications  icon F4 will return you to the Services list.  Equipment is
fitted or removed while you wait and the process is fully automated.

NOTE FOR FITTING GUNS

For  guns,  if your ship has more than one mounting you will be asked where
you  want  the  gun fitted.  Old campaigners may recall that left and right
mounts were once available but this was outlawed after so many people found
that  they  were  accidentally  shooting  their  own their friends or, more
embarrassingly, the police, due to the impracticality of using them.

DECIDING WHAT TO BUY OR REMOVE

Each  ship  has only so much space in the hull and out of this, room has to
be  made  for  the  engine,  guns,  fuel,  cabins,  cargo  and  so on.  The
proportion  that  these  items take up depends on your needs, for example a
fast courier ship's engine will dominate the hull.

Alternatively,  if  you  are interested in having a more deadly ship than a
fast  one,  engine size can be sacrificed for weapons.  All items are rated
for weight which is equivalent to the space they occupy, any space left can
be  used  for  cargo.   If  a  particular shipyard does not sell a piece of
equipment,  repairs  or  removal  cannot  be  carried out because the tools
required will not be available either.

SHIPS EQUIPMENT INVENTORY

A  list  of equipment on board can be obtained by using the Inventory icons
F3.   Cycle  through  the  pages until you find Ship Equipment Status.  The
picture of your craft will show any externally visible items.

REPAIRS, SERVICING AND BREAKDOWNS

Equipment  is  usually  very  reliable but will become more unreliable with
age, so servicing is important.  It can be done at any time, and the longer
you leave it the more likely a problem is to occur, so delay at your peril.
Shipyards  vary  in  the  service they give, so you may find that your ship
suffers  from  poorly  fitted  parts  and  shoddy  repairs.   If an item of
equipment  breaks down it will not function and will be shown on the Ship`s
inventory  page  (Inventory  icon  F3)  in  faded  text  until  is has been
repaired.   If  a  particular  shipyard does not sell a piece of equipment,
repairs  cannot  be  carried  out  because  the  tools required will not be
available either.

Having a piece of equipment repaired or serviced:

Select the Communications icon F4.

From the list choose Shipyard followed by Repairs and Servicing.

You will be presented with a list of servicing options.

NEW AND RECONDITIONED SHIP HULLS

This  mode  allows  you  to  part  exchange  your  ship for another.  It is
standard  procedure to strip a ship of its extras before selling it, as the
only  optional  item  which  affects your trade in value is the Hyperdrive.
New  ships  come  with  1t  of  the  appropriate fuel in the internal tank,
whatever the size of the tank.

Via  the  Comnmunications  icon  F4  select  Shipyard  followed  by New and
Reconditioned Ship Hulls

The ships on offer will be listed with sale details.

You  may  elect  to  Buy or to View the ship first.  Note that the types of
ship  on  offer  in a system will differ according to political allegiance,
population and types of visitor.
 
Additional  ship  information  is  provided when selecting View including
mountings crew and hyperspace range.

TAKING ON CREW MEMBERS

When  you  buy a larger ship, it may require extra crew in order to fly it.
Without  them  it will not be able to take off.  It is not necessary to buy
extra  cabins  because  they  come  with  the  ship  if  it  needs multiple
personnel.  You must hire the crew members through the Bulletin Board using
the  Communication icon F4 (see the TRADING section on page 61).  When they
are  hired,  a  page  called  Crew  Roster  appears  in  the inventory mode
(Inventory  icon  F3,  see  the ICONS section on page 8), and will list all
crew  members You can also fire them using this page, but only when you are
in dock.

Crew members will cost you the fun of the ride isn't enongh.  Wages will be
deducted  by  direct  debit  from  your  bank account.  Wages are sometimes
negotiable  but  are generally quite high because there is a certain amount
of  danger  for crew members.  For example, should you decide that you need
to  use  your  escape capsule, the crew are left behind.  Remember, you get
what you pay for.


SECTION FIVE  TRADING
=====================

BUY! SELL!

Trading  is  a simple process thanks to an agreement between the Empire and
the   Federation  that  allows  free  trade  within  all  systems  via  the
stockmarkets.   After  all  the  cold war has to be supplied and fuelled by
something.  There are also private markets which may be more lucrative, but
are sometimes risky.  Each will be explained in turn.

TRADING ON THE STOCKMARKET

You  need  to  go  to  a  city  or  space  station in order to trade on the
stockmarket.   You  cannot  trade  in  flight but at least you will be safe
whilst trading.

Select the Communication icon F4 at the bottom of your console.  and a list
of options will appear

Select  Stockmarket  from  the  menu,  and  you  will  be  presented with a
selection  of  items  (Fig  72).   Click on the down More...  arrow and any
remainder of the list will be given.

The  screen  displays  Buy  and Sell buttons, price per tonne, stock on the
market and the amount of cargo (in tonnes) that you have at present in your
hold

Before  trading  read  the  information on the items below.  Note that only
legal  items  will  be  listed.  For illegal goods you will have to use the
private market (see THE BULLETIN BOARD section on page 61).

BUYING

To buy one tonne of a chosen item, activate the button corresponding to the
item of your choice in the Buy column.  Your console will show the item you
have selected.  One click will auto load one tonne into your hold.  Holding
down the button will buy multiple tonnes at an accelerating rate.

If  you want to revise your transaction, the Sell button will subtract from
your stock.  There is no charge for changing your mind during trade but you
must make a decision reasonably quickly.

UNSUCCESSFUL TRANSACTIONS

You will be unsuccessful if:

Your  cargo  hold is full (indicated at the bottom left of the screen under
Cargo Space).  See also THE SHIPS INVENTORY section on page 60.

You  have  insufficient  money  (indicated at the bottom left of the screen
under Cash)

The stock is not available.

Information on all situations will be displayed on your console.

SELLING

This  is  a  similar  operation to buying, but using the Sell button.  Your
stock  level will be automatically decreased as you sell.  A mistake can be
changed  using  the Buy button or which there is no charge but if you delay
too long, someone else may buy first.

You will be unsuccessful if your own stock runs out, which will be shown on
your console.  See also THE SHIPS INVENTORY section on page 60.

STOCK AND PRICES

The  stock  level  indicated on the console is that on the stockmarket, not
the  private market which has its own separate holding.  Prices are brought
to  you  by  Zebulon  Intergalactic  Trading  Corporation  (ZITCO), and are
updated  each midnight Galactic Mean Time (GMT).  Galactic time was adopted
after  the  signing  of  the  treaty between the Empire and the Federation.
Hostilities  between them cannot be conducted if one party does not turn up
because  they  have  calculated  the  time incorrectly.  If the stock level
falls  due  to  demand, the local price may rise.  If a ship arrives with a
large  cargo of grain say, when it sells this onto the market, the price of
grain may fall at the next midnight price adjustment.

TRADING AND THE STARDREAMER TIME CONTROL

Prices are changed every midnight which may be a bit frustrating if you are
in  a  hurry  Use of the Time Control icons activates the Stardreamer which
will appear to speed up time.  There is a description of this Device in the
NAVIGATION  AND  FLIGHT section on page 22.  Remember that your enemies are
also  going to be sped up so only use this when it is safe to do so, though
even  on  an  open  air station, you will be protected by the station's own
defences.   Remember  also  that  the  station  makes  a small charge every
midnight for your stay.

CHOOSING WHAT TO TRADE

Systems  all have their own production and consumption, imports and exports
Generally the price of imports will be higher than the Galactic average and
that  of  exports lower than average.  For example a farming area will have
cheap  grain, so it will be a good place to buy in order to sell to an area
that has no grain production;

A  listing  of imports and exports for a given system can be found by using
the  Data  icon  F6  (see  the  NAVIGATION  AND FLIGHT section on page 15).
Information on illegal goods will also be found there.

CHOOSING WHERE TO TRADE

The Galactic Map (Galactic Map icon F2) shows a number of recommended trade
routes  (lined in pink) updated by ZITCO in 3195.  Faulcon De Lacey take no
responsibilty  for  any inaccuracies for this reason.  A map with the trade
routes has also been supplied with this manual,

It  is  always  worth  looking at the political and economical details of a
system  before possibly wasting fuel (see the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section
on page 15) Items that are in abundance in a star system will be relatively
cheap  to  buy.   Conversley  items  that  are in short supply will be more
expensive and worth selling there.

CASH

Your  funds  are indicated under Cash at the bottom left hand corner of the
screen.   They  are  safe  if your ship is destroyed thanks to an automatic
banking  system.   if  you  run  out of cash you could sell your ship for a
smaller  one or sell off a piece of equipment.  It may be worth looking for
offers of insurance from the Bulletin Board.

JETTISONING AND SALVAGING GOODS

This  is  an illegal practice but is occasionally necessary.  Certain goods
are  damaged by this act and this needs to be taken into consideration when
salvaging such cargo.

The following changes will occur:

Live animals will become animal meat

Slaves die and are officially used as fertilizer but rumour has it that the
bodies are finding their way onto the animal meat market.

Liquor,  luxury  goods,  grain,  fruit  and  vegetables are all turned into
rubbish.

Sometimes  containers  will  explode  unpredictably  when  released  due to
irregularities introduced during their manufacture.

JETTISONING

Select  the  inventory  icon  F3  and cycle to the Cargo Inventory section,
which  displays jettison buttons (Fig 73).  Activate the button next to the
goods which will be ditched one tonne at a time.

SALVAGING

You cannot salvage jettisoned goods unless you have bought a Fuel Scoop and
a Cargo Scoop Conversion.  If you have such equipment, manoevre so that the
cargo  item  is  immediately in front of the scoop and move forwards slowly
relative to it.

SHIP'S INVENTORY
----------------

This  gives  a  more  detailed account of your cargo and passengers, and is
obtained  by  using  the  Inventory  icon F3.  Clicking on this icon cycles
through seven pages of information for your perusal including:

SHIP EQUIPMENT STATUS
Lists weapons and equipment currently fitted to the ship.  See the SHIPYARD
section  on  page  51  for  details of individual items.  It also shows the
level  of  fuel  in  the engines which is distinct from the hyperspace fuel
(see FUEL CONSUMPTION in the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 26).

COMMANDER PROFILE
Lists awards and grading.  See the COMBAT section on page 47.

CREW ROSTER
Lists any crew members (on larger ships only).  See the SHIPYARD section on
page 53.

CARGO INVENTORY
Your  cargo  is  listed  if you have any.  Jettison on tonne of any item by
clicking on the relevant button.

PASSENGER AND SMALL ITEMS
This  lists  the names of your passengers or clients, the number of persons
on board, any small packages and the destination and how much money you are
still owed from the deal.

OUTSTANDING CONTRACTS LIST
This  shows  contracts taken on but not yet completed.  Those which involve
carrying parcels and passengers are listed on the Passenger And Small Items
page.

MINING INSTALLATIONS
Lists  the  locations  of  all  active  mining installations owned, See the
MINING section on page 65.

Note: the pages will not be shown if there is nothing on them.

THE BULLETIN BOARD
------------------

This  is  a  collection  of  small advertisements for trading, services and
requests  for  passage, amongst other things.  You will find other types of
advertisements so it is worth a browse.  It is also possible to contact the
military, its allegiance depending on the system you are in.

TRADE IN LEGAL ITEMS

Some  individuals  trade  on  the  Bulletin  Board  in  preference  to  the
Stockmarket, and taking a risk with them may benefit you.  There may be ads
for  specific  items which a person needs urgently that cannot be bought on
the  Stockmarket,  so they are prepared to pay over the odds for them.  You
may  earn  more  money  this  way  than  simply  selling directly on to the
Stockmarket.

Select the Communications icon F4
 
Select  Bulletin  Board  and  look for advertisements stating WANTED (Fig
74).

TRADE IN ILLEGAL ITEMS

Of course being a law abiding citizen you will not be engaging in this, but
in  order  to  understand  the  criminal  mind better you ought to know the
typical procedure.

Select the Communication icon F4.

Select  Bulletin Board and took for advertisements stating Goods Bought and
Sold  Though  there  may  not be any in a particular place or that day, The
More...   arrows  will  allow viewing of the ads which on a given day don't
fit on the screen.

Click  on  the  button  for the Goods Bought and Sold advertisement you are
interested in and a list will appear of all the illegal goods available.

Trade in a similar way to the stockmarket.

The  police,  although  aware of this practice, will not shut it down.  Not
only  do  they  take  a  cut  in  profits  but  they  often use it to their
advantage.   Traps  are  laid  in the form of advertisements and the astute
criminal  will  get to know their characteristics.  once successful trading
has  taken place, there is always the threat of customs officials, not that
you will ever have anything to hide of course.

CARRYING PASSENGERS

People  may  place  ads  asking  for passage for themselves or a group to a
stated  destination.   If  you  want  to do this, you need sufficient cabin
space  on your ship, which may mean extra outlay for you.  See THE SHIPYARD
section on page 50, where upgrading your ship is explained.

TAKING UP A REQUEST

On  the  bulletin  board  via  the  Communication  icon  F4,  look  for the
appropriate advert and select it (Fig 76).

Choose  one  of  the  responses  presented to you, for example one response
might ask why they are prepared to pay so much.

The answer comes up on the console at the bottom.

If you want to make a deal, click on "OK- agreed" at the top of the list of
responses

The passengers will appear on your passenger list.

Payment  is normally made on arrival at your clients' destination, although
some will pay half up front or even all!

CARRYING PACKAGES

To  act  as  a  courier,  negotiate in the same way as for passengers after
finding  adverts for transporting packages.  A package is deemed to take up
negligible  space  in  your  cargo  hold and of course does not need a life
support system.

TAKING ON CREW

If  you  ever  buy  a larger ship, it may require extra crew which are also
obtained  through  the  Bulletin  Board small advertisements.  More details
about  your contract with them can be found under TAKING ON CREW MEMBERS in
THE SHIPYARD section on page 53.


SECTION SIX  MINING
===================

THERE'S GOLD IN THEM THAR HILLS
-------------------------------

If  you  prefer  a  solitary life, then mining is for you.  This occupation
entails travelling from place to place collecting ore.  There are two types
of  mining:  Asteroid Mining and Surface Mining, both have their merits and
drawbacks.

ASTEROID MINING

Asteroid  mining  is  an  old method but it is tried and tested.  It is the
easiest  and cheapest way of obtaining ore and requires you to have a 30 MW
Mining Laser, Fuel Scoop and a Cargo Scoop Conversion.  You simply blast an
asteroid  with  the  laser then fly over the bits of asteroid and the Scoop
collects  as  much  ore  as  you can accommodate in the cargo bay.  Not all
asteroids  are  mineral  rich  though, so you may end up with a bay full of
rubbish.

SURFACE MINING

Once  you  are established, this type of mining is a more predictable means
of  getting  ore.  It does, however, demand a large initial outlay in order
to  acquire  the  installations  and  possibly a larger ship (minimum of 30
tonnes  of  free cargo space) to transport them The only recommended device
is  the  MB4 Mining Machine which, alas is still not widely available.  The
MB4  is impressive in that it not only mines but also refines the material,
so you put it in place, leave it and come back to pick up the results.  The
MB4  can  mine,  separate and refine minerals, alloys and even on occasions
precious metals and gem stones.

The  disadvantage  is  the  risk  of mining others' claims, resulting in an
aggresive response to your activities.  In some areas it is illegal to mine
and  police, depending their mood, may not be too interested in maintaining
a public image of fairness and understanding and may blast you to pieces.

SETTING UP YOUR WB4

Choose  a mining site with a temperature below 200 degrees Centigrade.  The
most  likely suitable locations will be on systems' inner planets which are
more  likely to be mineral rich.  Ones which humans have hardly touched are
more  likely  to  be  mineral  rich  as  machines  like  the  MB4  and  its
predecessors  are  very thorough, and will have scoured most of the surface
of  core  worlds by now.  To test the composition of the crust, you need to
land.

Land at the chosen site and select the Weapons Control Panel by clicking on
the Scanner

Activate the Unload Rig icon (Fig 78) which will cause the mining rig to be
unloaded  whereupon  it  will  analyse  a sample of the crust and relay the
results  to  your on board computer.  If the prospects are good it will bed
itself  in  and begin drilling immediately.  You may then take off and come
back later once it has mined the full capacitv of 10 tonnes.

FINDING THE MB4 AGAIN

All  the  mines  have a beacon which has your own coded signal allowing the
computer  to  pin-point  its  position.  If you pick up someone else's rig,
your computer will automatically register the code of the owner.  All other
rigs  belonging  to  them  in  this  star system will then be shown on your
inventory  page.  This means that stealing ore is possible however the same
can  be  done to you.  A safeguard is to avoid placing numerous rigs in one
system,  so  that  they  are not so easily found should one of your rigs be
purloined.  Your beacons will use a different code in each system.

Select the Inventory icon F3 and cycle through until you come to the Mining
Installations page (Fig 79).  It will list your rigs and their location.

Fly to the Star system in which a particular rig is situated.

Set  up  the Mining Installations page again and use the button next to the
rig you wish to find.

The  on-board computer will then set it up as your current target.  You may
then fly to it manually or with the Autopilot.  You can deselect the target
as  before  by  placing the pointer away from the target and using the left
hand mouse button.

COLLECTING THE ORE

Land  near  to  the installation and select the Load Rig icon (Fig 80) with
one  click.  this will remotely instruct the machinery to off load ore into
your  hold  until  it is full.  It will be no more than 10 tonnes at a time
because that is the maximum capacity of the MB4's hopper.

If there is no ore to collect the first selection of the icon will load the
rig onto the ship if you have space.

Your cargo inventory (Inventory icon F3) will show the minerals on board

COLLECTING THE MB4 MINING MACHINE

Land  next to the installation and click on the Load Rig icon twice so that
the rig and the contents of its hopper are taken on board.

As  stated  above, the rig will be loaded after the first click if there is
no ore in the hopper

The  rig  may  be left for further mining.  There is no need to bring it on
board if you intend to Deposit it in the same place.

If you want to move the MB4 to another location on the same surface because
a  site  is  'mined  out',  it is worth moving it a good distance.  This is
because the MB4 probes quite a large area with its underground drills.

If  your  MB4 had found a rich seam of minerals, Do not move it as the seam
may  be  a  long  way  below  ground and the MB4 may not be able to find it
again.


APPENDIX ONE  SHIPYARD EQUIPMENT
================================

MINES AND BOMBS
---------------

XB13 PROXIMITY MINE 
Explodes  when  object is within range.  They are carried on missile pylons
in place of a missile.

XB74 DUMMY PROXIMITY MINE 
Exactly  the  same  in appearance as the Proximity Mine, even on radar, but
they  do  not  explode,  in  fact they do nothing except increase your foes
laundry  bill.   You  can  even  recover them like cargo if you have a Fuel
Scoop  and  a  Cargo Conversion, but beware of accidentally scooping a real
one!

ENERGY BOMB 
Causes  the  drive system of smaller ships to overload and explode, but not
your  own  as  it  is  very  specific.  It can be withstood if a ship has a
strong enough shield.

MISSILES
--------

The  COMBAT section on page 38 gives additional information.  Note that all
the missiles have the same flying characteristics.

KL760 HOMING MISSILE
For destroying small spaceships and damaging larger ones.

LV111 SMART MISSILE
Similar to the Homing Missile but has ECM protection (not effective against
Navy Grade ECM).  Has a greater explosive power than the Homing Missile.

NN500 NAVY GRADE MISSILE
Even  more  bang for your money and immune to any known ECM system although
it is rumoured that technology is improving in this field

GUNS
----

The COMBAT scetion on page 38 provides furthur details.

30MW MINING LASER
Pulse  laser set up to blast asteroids into recoverable portions if you see
your  future in mining.  Can be used as a weapon but its repeat rate is not
as fast as weapon lasers.

1MW PULSE LASER
The  very  same  as  the bottom of the range laser weapon as the Phlaschygt
that  came with your ship.  seasoned combatants consider it only of use for
tattooing numbers onto slaves.  Better than nothing.

5MW PULSE LASER
Otherwise  known  as the Phlaschbugher.  More powerful than the Phlaschgyt,
but less devastating than the Beam Laser.

BEAM LASER
Continuous  laser  beam  which is more devastating than a Pulse Laser.  the
1MW,  4MW,  20MW,  and  100MW Beam Lasers are the same but more destructive
with increasing voltage.

LASER COOLING BOOSTER 
Some  busy  pilots  find  their  normal laser cooling equipment inadequate.
Since lasers cut out when they overheat, this Device is a bonus.

SMALL PLASMA ACCELERATOR 
Very big and heavy and carried by larger ships and Naval ships only.  It is
extremely potent and obliterates small to medium ships with one shot.

LARGE PLASMA ACCELERATOR 
The ultimate weapon pilots aspire to owning.

ECM SYSTEMS
-----------

ECM SYSTEM 
Short  for Electronic Counter Measures.  A clever device this, as it causes
detonation of all activated Homing Missiles in range (including your own).

NAVAL ECM SYSTEM 
This  higher specification system can also destroy the Smart Missile.  Only
obtainable at larger Shipyards.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
-----------------------------

CARGO BAY LIFE SUPPORT 
Superb  environment  control, including deodoriser and choice of four fresh
air  scents,  Fomalhaut  Harvest,  Ma`s Cookies, Seashore and Solar Breeze.
Needed for transportation of live animals and slaves.

EXTRA PASSENGER CABIN 
For one person it comes with life support, food dispenser and Holovid dream
inducer  for  long  journeys.   An  extra  facility  is the automatic decor
control which changes in order to compliment the mood of the occupants.  It
is  activated  by  sensors of heat and pheromones.  Takes up five tonnes of
cargo space.

ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT
--------------------

FOR CONTROL AND SURVEILLANCE

AUTOMATIC PILOT 
The  Robocruise  automatic navigation system has the capability to plot and
control  travel  to any destination within a system.  For details of how to
use the Automatic Pilot see the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT section on page 20.

AUTOREFUELLER DEVICE 
This  automatically  tranfers 1t of fuel from the cargo bay to the internal
tank  of  a ship`s engine when it is needed, so preventing any wastage.  It
also  avoids  any embarrassing moments when your engines fail during combat
or docking.

SCANNERS 
The scanner section in the middle of the console is provided as standard on
most  ships.   Some  hardened space travellers remove it in the belief that
demonstrates a certain amount of machismo, but others say this demonstrates
something else.

RADAR MAPPER
Scans  for  information  on a targeted ship.  For details of how to use the
Radar Mapper see the COMBAT section on page 43.

HYPERSPACE CLOUD ANALYSER
Determines  the destination and the exact time and date of arrival of ships
by  analysing  the  residual  space  time  disturbance  left behind after a
hyperspace jump.  You will also be told the mass of the ship which has left
or  is  about  to  arrive.   See  HYPERSPACE  in  the NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT
section, and also Combat on page 43.

DEFENCE
-------

SHIELD GENERATOR 
This device affords additional shielding to the normal damage resistance of
a  hull.  More than one can be fitted at once and the effect is cumulative.
They  recharge  from the ship`s power system, and each shield takes a fixed
amount  of  time  to  do  so.   For  example  a  large ship with ten shield
generators  will  take the same time to recharge as a ship with one shield.
The  ship  with ten however, will achieve the same defense as the ship with
one  shield in a tenth of the time because of the additive effect of shield
Generators.  See the COMBAT section on page 35.

ENERGY BOOSTER UNIT 
Boosts the recharging rate of all Shield Generators fitted.  A good buy for
very large ships

ESCAPE CAPSULE 
For those sticky moments when a fast exit is prudent.  It has no weapons or
shields.

ATMOSPHERIC SHIELDING 
Additional  coating to the hull which enables a ship to enter an atmosphere
at high speed.

HULL AUTO REPAIR SYSTEM 
A  large piece of equipment which is generally only fitted to larger ships.
Exactly  how  this works is a trade secret, but it does entail placing many
microbots in the hull reinforcing channels.  See the COMBAT section.

ENGINES AND MISCELLANEOUS
-------------------------

INTERPLANETARY DRIVE 
An  ordinary,  lightweight  engine that uses hydrogen fuel contained within
the drive.  It is not capable of hyperspace jumps but is suitable for small
interplanetary Hops.  It is equivalent to the Class 1 Hyperdrive but has no
hyperspace capability.

STANDARD HYPERDRIVES 
Standard  Hyperdrives  are  readily  available  and are used by most ships.
They  use Hydrogen fuel which can be bought or scooped (see Fuel Scoop) and
all  waste  products are used as reaction mass by the thrusters.  The range
of  a  Standard  Hyperdrive engine depends on the size of ship it is fitted
to.  For example, a Class 3 engine will have a greater range if fitted to a
200  tonne  ship  rather  than  a 300 tonne ship.  Although the classes are
listed  up  to  seven,  higher  classes  exist but are only obtainable from
specialists.

MILITARY HYPERDRIVES 
This  is  a different breed of engine to the Standard Hyperdrive in that it
has  a  greater  range  and is faster and lighter.  This means that a small
ship  can  carry  an  engine  of  the military type that is equivalent to a
Standard  Hyperdrive  that would be too big to fit.  All military ships are
driven by them.  They run on Military Fuel which is much more expensive and
has  drawbacks  (see MILITARY FUEL in APPENDIX TWO:  TRADE ITEMS Section on
page 79).

A  Military Hyperdrive will give your ship advantages over the competition,
but  it  will cost you to run it.  In the same way as Standard Hyperdrives,
the  range  is  a function of the size of tHe ship and the maximum possible
range  for  the  engine.  Military Hyperdrives are not widely available and
there  are  only  three  classes  for  sale.   The  reason is thought to be
instability  occurring  in  bigger  engines,  but rumours say that military
engineers  are working on this problem.  They are also reputed to be making
even lighter engines.

FUEL SCOOPS AND MINING EQUIPMENT
--------------------------------

FUEL SCOOP
Scoops  fuel from the upper layers of gas giants or the photosphere of cool
stars  when  you fly at below about 30km altitude while travelling forwards
at  speed.   In  order  to scoop from a gas giant, Atmospheric Shielding is
needed.   A  star however, requires greater protection for your ship in the
form  of  an Atmospheric Shield and a Shield Generator.  Even with these it
is still dangerous and only a desperate pilot would attempt it.

CARGO SCOOP CONVERSION 
Allows  the  Fuel  Scoop  to  be used to salvage jettisoned cargo and Dummy
Mines.   It  is  also  used  to  collect  ore  during  asteroid mining, and
explosion debris from ships.
 
MB4 MINING MACHINE 
This amazing machine prospects, mines and refines minerals for you (see the
MINING section on page 68) but is not readily available.


APPENDIX TWO  TRADE ITEMS
=========================

AIR PROCESSORS 
Devices  used  in  life  support systems to remove unwanted gasses from the
air.  These are vital to many mining establishments, keeping the air in the
huge underground complexes breathable.

ANIMAL MEAT 
Real  meat  from an animal.  A delicacy, but the market for this is growing
as  a  revolt  against synthetic meat.  People have become unsettled by the
thought  of  their  food  growing  in  vats of seething, viscous fluid, the
stench  of  which is indescribable The idea that real animal meat once felt
the  sun  on  its  back  and frolicked in a meadow feels more wholesome and
natural  and  such meat is claimed by many to taste better.  Given that the
amount  of  meadow  available  is far exceeded by the hooves to roam it and
that  factory  farming is unfashionable, the meat is rare and widely sought
after.  Trading in animal meat is illegal in some places.

ANIMAL SKINS 
This  covers the skins of all sorts of animals and parts of them.  It seems
that  the more that go into a garment, the more prized it is.  A ridiculous
extreme  is  a  coat woven from eyelashes of the Sweetums Scroblet, an ugly
animal  with  a  bad  temperament  and  no  endearing  qualities other than
colourful, luminescent eyelashes

BATTLE WEAPONS 
The heavy weapons used on the battlefield and usually illegal

COMPUTERS 
Mostly  used  for  administration  and as components for automated machines
like  space  craft, though some advanced cultures use them a great deal for
interactive entertainment systems.

FARM MACHINERY 
Machinery used to, erm... farm.

FERTILIZER 
Fertilizers  are  usually manufactured in vast chemical plants, but organic
waste is often used to supplement this.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLES 
This  can  seem like a loose term looking at some of the produce that comes
under  this  classification.   One could be forgiven for taking up a shovel
and  disinfectant  when  faced  for  the first time with the Oosli from the
Formalhaut system.

GEM STONES 
They  come  in  all colours and different levels of sparkle.  Fashions come
and  go, but the current gem to be seen wearing is the Zublic, a colourless
stone  that is totally reflective.  It is very easily mimicked but only the
real  stone is non irritant to body, so those who are status conscious have
them sewn into their skin.

GRAIN 
One  of  few  foodstuffs  that  is  both  traditionally  grown  and not too
expensive

HAND WEAPONS
Firearms.   Many  cultures  regard  them  as a necessary accessory and feel
naked without one.  Illegal in many systems.

HEAVY PLASTICS 
Have a variety of uses especially in high temperature environments like the
rocket engines.  Manufactured in large industrial complexes.

HYDROGEN FUEL 
The nornmal four star fuel for spacecraft.  All the waste products are used
as  reaction mass in the thrusters.  It can also be obtained by scooping it
from  stars  and  gas  giants  (see  FUEL SCOOPS in APPENDIX ONE:  SHIPYARD
EQUIPMENT on page 75).

INDUSTRIAL PARTS 
Everything from fusion motors to nuts and bolts.

LIQUID OXYGEN 
Used mainly by settlements on airless worlds for life support systems

LIQUOR
Covers  all  intoxicating Drinks from interesting local hooches such as the
Bourbon  from  the system of Epsilon Indi to unexciting brews made by large
industrial  companies.   An  example  is Splag, which is akin to watery Old
Nova, but some have been less generous in their appraisal
 
LIVE ANIMALS
Used  for  meat, exhibition or recreation or just companionship.  Your hold
must have a life support facility to carry them.

LUXURY GOODS 
Many  items  are  classed  as luxury goods, for example perfumes jewellery,
artefacts  and  fabrics.   The  most  treasured  are  generally produced on
esteemed worlds like Earth.

MEDICINES
Drugs  are as always, big business as people would rather be reassured by a
drop  of  something that tastes foul, rather than examine their way of life
that  more often than not causes the ill health.  However, the most healthy
person can still fall foul of bugs such as black hole fever (well known but
seldom  talked  about  except  in  jest  with references to escape velocity
usually being made).

METAL ALLOYS 
They  have  hundreds  of  uses, one example is the production of foam metal
valued for its lightness and use as electromagnetic shielding.

MILITARY FUEL 
Very  high  energy  per unit weight.  It is manufactured and consists of an
engineered  molecule  with  anti  matter  atoms suspended in it.  It is not
always  available and is expensive.  You need to weigh up the advantages of
greater  range and speed with the fact that it is converted to radioactives
when consumed.

MINERALS 
There is little to say about minerals.  Mined on rocky planets by machinery
except  on planet Major (van Maanen's star) where the Guardians of the Free
Spirit  exhume  it  with  only a hammer and chisel.  They believe in severe
hardship  and  live underground.  It is thought that money (left over after
buying  necessities like oxygen) is burned in ceremonies intended to purify
the  soul.   The worshippers think of all the luxuries, such as a salve for
their  bleeding  hands,  that  the  money  could  have bought causing great
anguish which is thought to be cleansing.

NARCOTICS 
The  most  common  is  Lyrae weed.  Narcotics are readily available on some
large  corporate manufacturing complexes to induce a sense of well being in
such  appalling  conditions.   Occasionally a few workers are killed due to
insensibility  or halllucinations but it is considered that they are better
off  that  way  and there are plenty more where they came from.  Illegal in
many places.

NERVE GAS 
Expect the police in most places to take up a chase if you trade in this.

PRECIOUS METALS 
Mainly  used  for  adornment  and  trying to maintain stability in unstable
financial  systems.  Generally cheaper in the outer systems, where precious
metals have not yet been mined out.

RADIOACTIVES 
Radioactive  materials  for  example Plutonium and Tritium.  Note that this
item  has  a  negative  trade  value,  in  other words, you have to pay for
someone to take it off your hands.  Some make a living out of being paid to
take  this  waste  away and deliver it to reprocessing plants (ie, anywhere
that   has   Radioactives  as  a  major  import).   More  unscrupulous  and
irresponsible  characters  will  prefer  to  jettison  it  instead, risking
prosecution.   This  is  a  highly  illegal practice and locals are usually
vehemently  opposed  to this act.  Police often don't bother with questions
but deal with you there and then, as this not only saves on police time but
court fees as well.

ROBOTS 
This  covers  a  whole  range  of  automata.   Generally they are intricate
machines  used  to  do  everything  from  serving canapes to use as assault
troops.   They  are  illegal  in  a  few  cultures,  mainly  because of the
violation of their work ethic, but also the extreme techno fear some people
experience.

RUBBISH 
Again,  this  has a negative price, so you must pay to dispose of it.  Some
cargo items when decompressed (by being jettisoned) will turn into rubbish.

SLAVES 
Consider  carefully  where  you are going to trade because slave trading is
illegal  in  many  systems, where it is seen as unacceptable.  Life support
needed.

SYNTHETIC MEAT
This  is  the  most common form of protein to be found, so it is relatively
cheap.   Grown in vats, this meat is in no way derived from animals, though
most would agreed that it tastes exactly the same as real meat.  It is sold
in  one  flavour,  called  Original,  which is fairly bland and unexciting.
Individual flavours are added by the user, for example Earth beef, Lava hog
from  Biggs  Colony or Brog buck from Homeland around Beta Hydri (for those
who like their meat to bite back).

WATER
H2O,  usually  needed  by  small  industrial  settlements and those with no
natural water supply.


APPENDIX THREE  AN INTRODUCTORY JOURNEY
=======================================

TO BEGIN...

You are at Sirocco Starport, on Merlin, a planet orbiting a gas giant which
in  turn  orbits  Ross 154, 9.35 light years away from Earth.  What you can
see  on  the  screen  is  the front view from your ship with the ringed gas
giant,  Aster,  looming in the sky.  The time of day and the date are given
on the left hand side of the console.

1.First take a look at the system you are in.

(a) Select the Galactic Map icon F2 and you will see a map of all the stars
in your vicinity.  Ross 154 is in the middle, highlighted in green.

2.Find out details about the system.

(a) Select the Data icon F6 and a diagram of your system will be shown

(b)  Count two bodies from the star, Ross 154.  This is Aster, Now click on
the planet below it and information on Merlin will come up.

(c)  Select  the Economy icon F7 to get trade details for the whole system.
Notice  that  major  exports  are  animal meat (this is fish on Merlin) and
liquid oxygen so both should be relatively cheap.
 
(d)  Select  the  Political  icon  F8  to  get  information on the social
structure.  This system is under federation control so should be reasonably
safe.

3.  Find a place to sell the goods you buy at a reasonable price.

(a) Go back to the grid by using the Galactic Map icon F6.

(b)  Use the Arrow (Cursor) keys to move the map until Barnard's Star (look
up and then right) is in the middle of the screen and highlighted in green.

(c) Select the Data icon F6

(d)  Click  on  the  bodies  until  you  find  the  space  station orbiting
Birminghamworld, it is called Boston Base.

(e)  In  the same way as steps 2(c) and 2 (d), check the economy and social
structure.   You  will  see that animal meat and liquid oxygen are imports.
the  system  is  a corporate state and it should be reasonably safe, so you
could trade here.

(f)  You  can see the orbits of the systems bodies by using the Orbital Map
icon F10.

(g)  If you want to take a closer look, you can use the Zoom In icon F7 and
the Zoom Out icon F8.  Click on the body to place it into the centre of the
screen and then use the icons.

4.   Buy  one tonne of fish at Merlin.  You can only trade while in dock so
now is the time to do it.

(a) Select the Communication icon F4, and you will be presented with a list
of options.

(b) Choose Stockmarket.

(c)  A  list  of items with Buy and Sell buttons is now displayed so locate
Animal Meat.  You can afford to buy one tonne of animal meat.

(d)  Click  on  the  Buy  button  for animal meat once so that one tonne of
animal  meat  will be autoloaded into your hull.  (If you ever buy too much
by  mistake,  simply  click  on  the  Sell  button until you have the right
amount).   The  console will display the amount of cash and cargo space you
have left.

5.   See if there are any packages to take to Barnard's star.  This sort of
thing  is what makes money but there is some risk involved.  The good thing
about  packages  is  that  they  take  up negligible cargo space and do not
require cabins or life support.

(a) Click on the Communications icon F4 again followed by Bulletin Board

(b) Scroll through the advertisements using the up and down More...  arrows

(c) There may not be a suitable advertisement but if there is one, click on
it.  If there isn't go to step 6.

(d)  A  list of replies will be presented to you from which you must choose
one to send by clicking on it.  The brave will click on "OK- agreed".  with
no questions asked.

(e) The package will be autoloaded into your ship.

(f)  You can check that it is on board by clicking on the Inventory icon F3
until the page showing passengers and small packages is displayed.

6.  Take off for Barnard's Star system

(a)  Go  back  to  the front view by using the View icon F1 and click on it
until Front View is displaved on the right of the console.

(b)  Select  the  Communication  icon  F4  and  you will be given a list of
options.  Click on Launch Request.

(c)  When  clearance  is indicated on the console, select the Right Control
icon  F7.   This  will cause your vertical thrusters to engage, lifting you
slowly upwards.

(d)  Tip  the nose of the ship by moving the mouse backwards whilst holding
the right hand mouse button down.

(e)  Activate the thrusters using the Enter key for a couple of seconds and
you will begin to fly out of the atmosphere.  You now have manual control.

7.  Make a hyperspace jump to Barnard`s Star.

(a)  Use  the  Galactic  Map icon F2 and make sure Barnard's Star is in the
middle of the screen where it will be highlighted in green.

(b) Return to View mode by using the View icon F1.

(c) Activate the hyperspace engine with the Hyperspace icon F8.  After your
journey through hyperspace you can see the effects of the disturbance.  Use
the  View  icon  F1  to  get  a  the  rear  view  in order to see it.  This
hyperspace  cloud  behind  you  is visible for an enormous distance and may
attract  pirates, so it is wise to leave it as soon as possible by pressing
the  Enter  key  to  increase your Set speed.  Click on the View icon again
until you get back to the front view.

(d)  Select  the Identification text icon F10 which will overlay names onto
the systems bodies which may not yet be visible to the naked eye.

(e) If you wish to look around then you can do so by holding down the right
mouse button to swing the ship round.  This is not essential to get to your
destination.

8.   Fly  to  Birminghamworld  by  using the Autopilot and Stardreamer Time
Control
 
(a) Take a look at the system structure by using the Galactic Map icon F2
and  then  the  Current  System Map icon F2 to obtain an orbital map of the
current system.

(b)  Zoom  in  using  the  Zoom  icon  F7 until you can see Birminghamworld
clearly

(c)  Put Birminghamworld in the middle of the screen by clicking on it then
zoom  in until it is clearly defined and the orbital lines almost cover the
width of the screen.

(d)  When  you  can see the space station name (Boston Base) move the mouse
while  holding  down  the  right  hand mouse button so that you can see the
space station clearly.

(e)  Set  up  the destination for the Autopilot by using the targeting icon
F10

(f)  You  will  be instructed by the console to select a target so point at
the  space  station  and click on it and a homing square will be displayed.
If  you  take  too  long  doing this you may have to use the targeting icon
again.

(g) Return to View mode with the View icon F1.

(h)  Engage  the Autopilot with the Flight Control icon F7 by activating it
until Autopilot is shown on the console, the ship is no longer under manual
control

(i)  You will see targeting squares looking like a tunnel leading to Boston
Base, Aa you get closer they will come towards you more rapidly, indicating
that you should slow down as you approach.  Ideally, these should pass at a
constant rate.

(j)  Even though you are relatively close to Boston Base it will still take
a  long  time to get there so use the Stardreamer time Control to make time
appear  to pass more quickly.  Further details of its function are given in
the NAVIGATION section on page 22.

(k)  Locate  the time Control icons.  The single arrow sets normal time and
each  icon  to  the right increases the apparent rate of passage of time by
ten  times.   Select  1000  times normal time (four arrows) or 10,000 times
normal  time  (the  last icon on the right) as you wish.  When you approach
the  space station the on-board computer will return you to normal time for
docking.
 
(l)  The  docking process is handled by the Autopilot including obtaining
clearance from traffic Control, If you do not wish to watch the docking the
then you may operate the time control again.

9.  Sell your goods.

(a)  Once  docked  select  the Communication icon F4 and choose Stockmarket
again

(b)  Sell  your  goods  by  using the Sell buttons.  ie.  click on the Sell
button for Animal Meat once.

(c) The money shown under Cash at the bottom left of the console should now
be  a  greater sum than you started with, unless you have been very unlucky
with the stockmarket prices.

(d) Remember to refuel by buying at least one tonne of hydrogen fuel!


APPENDIX FOUR  MECHANICS OF SPACE FLIGHT
========================================

FLY BY WIRE

As starship designers through the ages have found, space craft have so many
potential  degrees  of  freedom  they  are  impractical for a mere human to
control  to  the full unaided.  Logically a free flying combat craft has at
least  five  independent  directions (or vectors) to control, Those vectors
are:

1. Facing vector (unit magnitude) F
2. Velocity vector V
3. Thrust vector T
4. Camera viewing vector C
5. Weapon vector W

It  is  clearly  logical  to  combine  some of these, but the more they are
combined,  the more functionality is lost, Faulcon de Lacy (and indeed most
ship  manufacture)  combine  (1),  (4)  and  (5)  and  control  (2) and (3)
automatically,  leaving  the  pilot to control only (1), with the option of
disabling  the  automatic control of (2) and (3) when necessary.  Even this
seems  a  handful  for  a  species  evolved  to move in only two and a half
dimensions  (up  and down are very much secondary to north, south, east and
weat).

The  pilot  is assumed to have a desired velocity vector D along his or her
facing vector, the magnitude of which is the desired speed S they have set.

Hence: D = sF
      and thrust to achieve velocity D T = mf (D-V)
      where f is a factor chosen for fuel efficiency
      and m is the mass of your craft

A  maximum  value is given to f (about 1).  to avoid wasteful thrusting and
possible oscillations.  This is why your craft will slowly settle down over
the landing pad even with a zero set speed.  At higher speeds the limits of
the  power  of  the  thrusters  effectively  restrict  the value of f.  The
desired  thrust is resolved into components along each of the ships working
thrusters and if any of the these cannot provide sufficient thrust then the
value  of f is reduced appropriately (preserving the direction of thrust is
more important than its magnitude).

FRAMES OF REFERENCE

The  problems  of  the  fly-by-wire  technique are further complicated when
considering the frames of reference in which velocities are measured.  When
a  vehicle  moves  slowly  along a street, say, the driver does not want to
know  that  both  the  street  and  the vehicle are moving sideways at many
thousands  of kilometres per hour (due to the velocity of the planet around
the  star, and the rotation of the planet).  Indeed, if the vehicle were to
face  the  way  it  is  travelling, then its motion along the road would be
almost irrelevant.  What the driver wants is to face along the direction of
travel  in  the  frame of reference of the planet, which is both moving and
rotating.

Hence  D = sF + R
       where R is the velocity of the frame of reference
       and ideal thrust T = mf ( D-V )
       T = mf ( sF + R-V )

Your  on  board computer automatically selects the body you are most likely
to  want to define a frame of reference for your motion.  This is usually a
planet  or  moon,  but  can also be a space station or large ship.  It also
decides  whether it would be more intuitive to use a rotating frame or not.
For  space  stations,  it  is  only sensible to use a rotating frame in the
docking  tunnel  otherwise your ship continually thrusts to attempt to move
in a circle in time with a similar point on the station.

CHOICE OF FRAMES OF REFERENCE

The  body is used to define your current frame of reference is shown on the
bottom  right  of  your  head  up  display  this  is  chosen by a weighting
function.   For  planets  and  stars  this  is based on mass, thus a star's
sphere  of  influence  generally extends way beyond its planets.  For other
bodies it is based on their dimensions.

You  may  notice  your  ship's  engines  suddenly starting to thrust when a
different frame of reference is chosen.  This is not a fault with your ship
but  is because your set speed has suddenly appeared to change as it is now
measured relative to the new body.
