The Story
~~~~~~~~~

Tonight sees the premiere screening of core designs new epic
production. Working into the early hours of the morning, Clutch
Gable the companies editor was busy with the last minute editing.
Fighting a losing battle with exhaustion; three nights had passed 
since his last sleep. Cutting and splicing each scene together he
laboured over the movie.

Soon, the mesmeric ticking of the editing machine had sent him 
into a deep sleep, where he dreamed of Hawaiian dancers and cold 
cold beer, the sun beating down on his well tanned chest as naked
(this has nothing to do with the story so will skip an hour
or so ... !).

As Clutch slept peacefully, there was the faint sound of 
footsteps approaching the office door, it slowly opened and
a shadowy figure crept in. Silently the theif picked up the 
canisters containing the final edit of the movie, and stole
away into the night.

The following morning, the constant ringing of the telephone
dragged Clutch out of his slumber. With great effort he lifted 
the reciever. 

"Hello" he mumbled. On the other end of the line, the all too 
familiar voice of "Buster" Smith, head of Core pictures greeted him.

"Good morning Clutch, how are you doing with the editing? Its only 
a few hours to the premiere and i cant stress how important this 
picture is to us."

"Oh, Ive just finished the last scene sir" replied clutch, turning 
to admire his night's work. Suddenly a sick chill filled his whole
body as he stared at the space where the canisters should have been.
"I'll...I'll bring them to your office shortly sir" he stammered, 
dropping the receiver back into place as he tried to clear the
cobwebs from his head in the hope of recalling where hed put the 
canisters and began frantically searching the office, praying that
hed find the finished reels somewhere.

After a few minutes he realised that his search was in vain and the
canisters had finally gone. Deep down he realised that there was only
one possible answer - their biggest rival, Grumbling Pictures had
taken the cannisters as he was sleeping.

He ran from the building, and hailing a taxi he headed to where he 
hoped to find the movie. Upon arrival at Grumbling Pictures he 
entered through a side door into a studio where he found himself 
amongst the stage set of a Western in the midst of production.

And this is where his quest begins. Will clutch find the missing 
movies before this afternoon's premiere??
