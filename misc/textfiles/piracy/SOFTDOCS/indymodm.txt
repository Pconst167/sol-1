                       MODEM PLAY(Please, No Wagering!)

    IndyCar Racing's modem play feature lets you go head-to-head against
    a friend, or fierce rival.  In order to play IndyCar Racing in this
    fashion, you'll need either two Hayes-compatible modems operating
    at a minimum of 9600 baud each, or a null modem serial cable connected
    between the serial ports on the two computers.  In addition, a registered
    copy of IndyCar Racing must be installed on each computer.


    Each player will begin by choosing 2-PLAYER RACE from the MAIN menu.
    You can select SETUP if you need to change your modem's configuration
    .  You can specify which COMMUNICATIONS PORT your modem is installed
    on(Com 1 through Com 4).  You may then enter the INTERRUPT (IRQ 7, for
    example) if you are not using default values.  You may also wish to
    input an INITIALIZATION STRING, which is sent to the modem to specify
    its internal parameters.  The DIAL PREFIX and DIAL SUFFIX are inserted
    before and after each number that is dialed.  You need only to input
    this information once, unless you change your hardware.  Choose DIRECT
    CONNECT instead of MODEM only if you are using a serial cable with
    a null modem attachment.


    To play by modem, decide ahead of time which player will be the dialer
    , and which player will be the answerer.  The answerer's computer will
    actually run the simulation, therefore it is advisable that the player
    who owns the faster machine be the answerer.  Follow the onscreen 
    prompts according to your responsibilities as either the dialer or
    answerer.  The answerer does not have to input a phone number, only
    the dialer does.  Be sure that your modem is set to disable compression
    and error detection or correction, and to force 9600 baud transmission.
    Consult your modem manual or manufacturer for the necessary setup
    codes, and type them into the initialization string option on the SETUP
    menu.  Failure to do so may result in erratic car movements.


    Upon establishing a connection between the two computers, the answerer
    will have the responsibility of choosing a track.  Both computers
    must contain a copy of the track you intend to race on, and only,
    and only the tracks common to each system will be shown.  If the dialer
    does not have Nazareth installed on the hard drive, for instance, that
    track will not be available for selection, even though this track may
    be installed on the answerer's computer.

    Modem play involves the SINGLE RACE format only.  After the answerer
    selects a session (practice, qualify or race), the dialer must choose
    the same session for play to begin.  For example, both players are
    driving in the PRACTICE session when the answerer suddenly decides
    to move onward to the QUALIFYING session.  The dialer must also choose
    the QUALIFYING session in order for both players to advance to 
    qualifying.  The answerers REALISM option settings will apply for both
    players, including race length, number and strength of opponents, 
    weather, yellow flags and pace lap.  If you wish to race against
    each other without the computer opponents present, the answerer must
    set the max. number of opponents to "0" in the realism menu.

    The dialer will drive number99, a white IndyCar with red sidepods and
    blue trim, while the answerer's car will bear the traditional blue
    sidepods will red trim, and carry number 0.  Remember, you can check
    the currect race standings from inside the cockpit by pressing the
    "F1" key.

    Following each session, players may retreat to their respective garages
    for car setup adjustments.  Once the actual race begins, the program
    will play much like the standard one-player version, with few exceptions
    .   If either player presses "escape" then both will exit the session
    immediately and return to the 2-PLAYER RACE menu.  If either player
    exits the track, he will be given the opportunity to hang up or 
    continue.  The answerer  will also have the option of selecting 
    another track.  While you are connected, a telephone icon will begin
    to flash if bad data is received, and will disappear entirely if the
    connection is lost.  Players may then continue the session against
    the computerized opponents, or exit to the main menu and select
    2-PLAYER RACE to try again.
