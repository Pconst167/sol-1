How to win at the NYCrack of Dragon's Lair

This game is a lot of fun.  I don't suggest you read this text file
straight through because you would lose most of the fun of this
game.  Although you do get to watdch the great graphics.  So this
text file explains how to get by each of the indavidual scenes. 
Read each section only if you can't figure out hopw to get by.
