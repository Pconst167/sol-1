 CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS
          Part 1

 Tyranthraxus is back, and is he mad! Those of you who have played S.S.I. and
TSR's popular POOL OF RADIANCE will remember "Mr. T." (as he is affectionately
known to fantasy role-players).

 In CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS, Mr. T. returns, and he has devised a fiendish
scheme to punish your adventurers for what they did to him the last time they
met. His revenge involves tattooing magical blue symbols on their arms.

 The five different evil powers that inhabit the Dalelands Area (Tyranthraxus is
one of them) have each left their marks on your adventurers, stripping them of
their armor and weapons, leaving them unconscious and suffering from amnesia in
an Inn in Tilverton.

 Your adventurers shortly discover that the marks that writhe under their skin
can be used to magically control their actions! And that the reason they are in
Tilverton is to assassinate the King of Cormyr!

 In order to control their own destiny, your party will have to find each evil
power in the Dalelands and force it to remove its individual controlling bond.
They will face Tyranthraxus last, and if they defeat him, you will win the game!

 This walkthru is based on my having played the C-64 1.0 version. The walkthru
is neither complete, nor even definitive. Because of the random nature of the
encounters and events in the game, there are many different ways of playing and
winning. This walkthru covers only some of them. So, take my advice with a grain
of salt. Sometimes, you may have to take a whole shaker full! <Grin>

 KNOWN BUGS TO WATCH FOR

 You may run across errors in the game -- particularly in the first IBM version.
For example, the Ioun stones generate too many attribute points, and casting the
Slow spell will freeze the game. Many of these bugs can be avoided by saving the
game often, and going back to earlier saves when you run across something that
doesn't seem right. Hopefully, as later versions are released, the bugs will be
corrected.

 GETTING STARTED

 In order to boot the game, you have to type a letter from a code wheel, instead
of typing the whole word you find. The game is not copy-protected. I advise you
to play from copies of the disks -- not the originals! (Playing from copies is
_very_ important!)

 As in POOL, you can play and win with different kinds of parties. This walkthru
is based primarily on the exploits of my first party, consisting of high-level
characters transferred from POOL: three magic-users (multi-classed elves who
were also fighters, one of whom was also a thief); a human cleric; a half-elf
cleric/fighter; and a human fighter.

 I also played part of the game with a low-level party created within CURSE,
consisting of three magic-users (elf fighters, one of whom was also a thief), a
human cleric, a paladin, and a ranger. Some comments are based on the exploits
of that party.

 QUICK START

 There is a party of pre-rolled characters for you to run on the third side of
disk "B." The party consists of two magic-users, a paladin, a cleric, a ranger,
and a fighter/thief. If you don't want to take the time to create your own, this
party will do just fine. You can modify their attributes before playing a game,
if you like. In the IBM version, there is also a two-paladin party. If you are
looking for further challenges after having won the game with a party of six,
see if you can win the game with only two! The Quick Start tactical advice on
how to play the game and win battles is excellent, by the way.

 DUAL-CLASS CHARACTERS

 Be careful of the dual-class character option. I didn't use it, so I can't give
you a report from personal experience. But be aware that some gamers have had
problems in getting both classes to work properly, while others have not had any
problems. Generally, the reported problems seem to occur when attempting to
apply a dual-class to high-level characters. Contrary to the manual, you must
reach a higher level in the character's second class to be able to use all the
spells, etc., that the character is entitled to use, instead of just those
belonging to the level achieved within the character's original class.

 TRANSFERRING CHARACTERS

 If you transfer your characters from POOL or HILLSFAR, all their experience
points transfer with them, and you may train for as many levels as your
experience points allow. Note that you can only transfer characters from
HILLSFAR that were either created in that game, or that were created in POOL and
transferred to HILLSFAR (but only with the C-64 version 1.1 of CURSE!)

 CREATING NEW CHARACTERS

 Characters created within CURSE are given 25,000 XPs. This will put most
single-class characters into the 5th level of their particular class.
Multi-class characters will, of course, be at lower levels since they have to
divide their points.

 You can only modify your characters' attributes right after they're first
created, not after using the characters to play the game.

 TIPS FOR SAVING THE GAME

 Save the game often on at least two different disks. Also take advantage of the
Remove Character feature in the boot menu (also found in the Training Halls).

 This saves an individual character's statistics to disk; these saves can be
used to replace character files that get damaged while playing. Use this feature
periodically, and you won't lose your favorite characters. When a character is
damaged, get back to the Training Hall (or to the boot menu), _remove_ the disk
from the drive, then drop the old character. Replace the disk and select Add
Character; the last saved version of the character will be restored.

 You can also replace characters this way who are dead or gone, instead of
resurrecting them at the Temples. (Each time a character is resurrected at a
Temple, he loses a Stamina point.)

 This feature can also be used to duplicate items. Transfer the items from the
character you are dropping before you restore him. However, this is not
necessary or recommended. You will find plenty of magical weapons and armor
without having to duplicate anything.

 When you save a game on the IBM, a save game file and three save character
files are generated for each character. The save game file is SAVGAMx.DAT, where
x is the save letter (A, B, C, etc.). The file names for the first character are
CHRDATx1.SAV, CHRDATx1.ITM, and CHRDATx1.SPC. The file names for the second
character are CHRDATx2.SAV, CHRDATx2.ITM, and CHRDATx2.SPC, and so on. Make a
copy of those files, then copy them back.

 To restore a dead character in the IBM version:

 1. Remove the character and make a copy of the files.
 2. Add the character back and resume play.

 To replace a dead character in the IBM version:

 1. Remove the character.
 2. Copy the save files over the dead files.
 3. Add the character back into the party.

 You lose all the XPs, levels, and items the character received since the last
save, however.

 GAME SPEED

 In one of the combat sub-menus (press END, ALTER, then SPEED), there is an
option to change the default game speed (2) to 1 or 0. Zero is very fast and
speeds up the game considerably, but you will not be able to read messages
flashing on your screen. I wouldn't recommend using this option until you are
familiar enough with the game to know what the messages will be.

 MAPPING

 This game does not strictly require mapping. The mazes are relatively few and
small compared to most other computer role-playing games. But if you don't trust
your memory and want to find every cache of magical weapons hidden in CURSE's
dungeons, mapping is highly recommended (use graph paper).

 TRAINING HALLS

 Make sure you check your characters' experience points regularly, and take them
to the Training Halls to get their levels increased whenever you can. If you
don't, you may lose the excess experience points that accumulate for each level.

 GOLD

 Be wary of accumulating so much wealth that your characters become unable to
move 12 squares in a turn. Use your excess gold to buy items in the Magic Shop
at Zhentil Keep. (Save some for training expenses, of course.)

 COMBAT

 At least half of the game is spent in combat, and much of the fun of the game
is in determining the tactics necessary to win the many battles. Read the
"Combat Tips" in Part V of this walkthru for more detailed help. Generally,
though, either blast enemy magic-users and clerics with spells as quickly as you
can, or move right next to them and hack away with your weapons. Enemy clerics
and magic-users do not cast spells very often when being beaten on the head with
a sword!

 Your clerics' Hold Person spells are effective against most magic-users and
clerics; one spell can incapacitate several of them! Stinking Cloud is also
sometimes effective in disabling some of them. (Hold Monsters stops the larger
creatures.) It's best to have a weapon-bearing character immediately strike the
immobile enemy. One blow will destroy him.

 OVERALL STRATEGY

 You must find three magical items before you can get into Myth Drannor and meet
Tyranthraxus, but that's the only major requirement in the scheme of things. You
will find the three items in Hap, Yulash, and Zhentil Keep.

 If you visit the Standing Stone, you will be advised to go to Hap first, and
then to Yulash, saving Zhentil Keep as the last bond adventure before Myth
Drannor.

 If you want to spend some time exploring and building up your characters'
experience points before attempting the bond adventures, there are a lot of
shorter adventures in the game. They are found by taking all the different
travel options between cities. The "Wilderness" option is particularly
rewarding. The "Patrol the Forest" option at Standing Stone usually leads to a
battle with dangerous black dragons, but you can win a lot of experience points
by defeating them.

 After you have completed your second bond adventure, go to a city, and you will
have an added option: "Search Area." This usually leads to a cave or ruins that
you can explore. It's another great way to build your experience points, and to
find weapons, scrolls, and gold. Be warned that some of them are quite involved
and have several levels. The lower levels are often far more dangerous and
difficult than one of the bond adventures!

 One of them (The Tower of Oxam outside of Dagger Falls) has a huge battle in a
meeting room with multiple Beholders, Elf Lords, High Priests, and Rakshasa that
is seemingly impossible to win. It is possible, however. Read "Part 4" if you
want to know how.

 BEST ADVICE

 After Tilverton, explore the various travel options, and visit the cities
briefly so you'll know where the Training Halls are. Talk to the barkeepers.
(Some you won't be able to talk to until you've completed a nearby Wilderness
option.)

 Visit Zhentil Keep to buy items in the Magic Shop. While there, fight the
clerics, fighters, and magic-users who pick fights with you to collect some
armor and weapons. (Stay at the Inn and save the game there. The random
encounters, although usually easily won, can often be very dangerous.)

 Next, pick a bond adventure. Hap is perhaps the longest, and involves the most
battles; Yulash is the shortest, and involves the fewest battles; Zhentil Keep
involves nearly as many battles as Hap. All of the adventures can be won with
even the low-level characters created in CURSE, and they are fairly equal in
difficulty, depending on how lucky you are.

 Whichever bond adventure you choose, or whatever the order you play them in,
you'll have some very tough battles. But if your tactics are sound, and you're
persistent, you will eventually prevail and emerge victorious!

 Good luck and happy hunting!


 CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS
          Part 2

 TILVERTON

 The first evil power can be found in the sewers of Tilverton! But first you'll
have to leave the Inn and find some armor and weapons. (The blacksmith is to the
west of the Inn.) Each of your characters has 300 platinum to spend, and that's
more than enough to buy everyone the best armor in the shop. (Plate has the
lowest AC, but it restricts movement points to 6; you may prefer the lighter
banded mail.) Buy a long sword, shield, long bow, and plenty of arrows for each
of your fighters (thief, ranger, or paladin), a mace or flail and staff-sling
for your cleric, and a dagger or staff and darts for any single-class
magic-users in your party.

 If you have transferred your party from POOL, you should go to the Training
Hall (north of the Inn) and train for the levels to which you are entitled. This
will use up the remaining platinum pieces you were given. It is now safe to map
and explore the rest of Tilverton.

 You will find a mage who will talk to you about your "sigels." His price is
steep, however: half of what you have! If you're curious, check it out.

 There is a shop that sells silver mirrors and flasks of oil. A silver mirror
may be handy later in the game when you face a Medusa or two or more. I never
used the flasks of oil, but that doesn't mean they're not useful.

 There is a Temple where a priest will attempt to remove your sigels at no cost:
The attempt will be futile. There is a bar whose barkeeper will give you
information if you buy whiskey, and _only_ if you buy whiskey. You can get into
a brawl at the bar, if you like. In order to do so, just buy anything other than
whiskey!

 Eventually, you can try to get out of the city. Unfortunately, you'll be
stopped by Royal Guards who say the way is blocked because a Royal Carriage is
coming. If you've explored enough places in the city, the Royal Carriage
arrives, and your bonds compel you to attack the King!

 Fortunately, the man in the carriage is an impostor, but you will have to fight
off a couple waves of Royal Guards who are protecting him (unless you choose to
surrender). There will be a brief pause in which you are advised to leave the
area. If you immediately duck into the alleyway in front of the Inn, you will
find a thief who will offer to help you escape. Accept his offer. (He'll also
help you escape from jail, if you choose to surrender to the Guards.)

 He'll escort you underground to the Thieves Guild where you will have the
chance to rest (and camp). Take the opportunity to heal, memorize spells, and
save your game: You'll need to be ready to fight some tough battles. Almost
immediately after the Master Thief gives you some information about the Princess
Nacacia, who's being held prisoner in a place called The Hideout, these battles
will begin. (Reach The Hideout by going south through the sewers.)

 If you have been reading the clues you've been getting, you'll know that
Nacacia is dressed in purple. You'll also notice that fanatical cult members
dressed in green are hanging around the city. Bits of purple cloth will be found
along the way, marking a trail for you to follow.

 Carefully map your way to and through the Cellars. There's a treasure room in
the Thieves Guild area that has some magical weapons. You can also rest here to
heal and memorize new spells. The treasure room is southeast of where you have
your first battle. Keep going south, and you'll find the entrance to the Sewers.
Along the way you'll find a reference to a map in your journal (Entry #4). This
map is accurate, but incomplete; you'll have to map every room along the way to
be sure you don't miss anything.

 In the sewers, you'll find a large group of Otyughs that have a shining object
in their mound. They can be bargained with, so you don't need to fight them
unless you want to. (Fighting them is difficult, but the reward is 5000 XPs if
you win.) If you choose to bargain, they will ask you to get them some food from
The Neighbors. The Neighbors are a group of Otyughs south of this group. Fight
and destroy the second group, get the food, and return to the first group for
your reward. (If you kill The Neighbors before you make the bargain, you won't
be rewarded.)

 Just before you get to The Hideout, you'll find a secret door to a Training
Hall that will allow you to cash in some of those experience points to possibly
gain more levels and spells before you tackle The Hideout. Next to the secret
Training Hall you will find some Trolls. Winning that battle will give you more
magical weapons. (There are a four more Trolls in the next room, but there are a
number of Gators with them. In order to win this battle you will need to first
kill all the gators before the Trolls; otherwise, the Trolls all regenerate!
Standing in the square where a Troll dies also prevents him from regenerating.)

 A few steps south of the Training Hall you will find a Knight from Myth
Drannor. He will ask who you serve. Answer "Princess Nacacia," and you will get
some help from his fellow Knights later in the game. Do not fight him: he's on
your side!

 The Hideout is a complex of many rooms. One of them is a torture room, where
Princess Nacacia's cleric is being tortured. Rescue him. (The adventures of the
princess and her cleric lover are a sub-plot that runs through the game.)
Princess Nacacia is held prisoner in the corner room to the southwest. Before
going there, you should stop by the armory. Open the box there and you'll find
more magical weapons. Save the game here.

 When you enter the southwest corner room, you will have one more battle, then
your first bond will fade from your arm. (Hold Person and Stinking Cloud spells
will help get you through this battle. Remember, always kill off enemy clerics
and magic-users first!)

 Even though you rescued his daughter, the King will banish you from Tilverton:
You can't be trusted while you bear the other sigels!

 THE DALELANDS

 You will be shown a map of the Dalelands area, and where you are. You'll be
asked where you want to go and offered various travel options for getting there.
Explore the Dalelands, and use every travel option. The Wilderness options lead
to some interesting adventures involving battles with different groups of
monsters between each town. The Boat option leads to battles with pirates. These
battles are challenging tactical exercises providing you with experience before
you undertake the bond adventures. You will find that most of the cities you
visit only have a bar, a temple, and a general store. Go t the bars to pick up
information. You will find Training Halls in Ashabenford and Essembra.

 You will run into unfriendly people in some of the towns, like Dagger Falls.
Removing the Zhentil bonds makes the innkeeper in Dagger Falls friendly;
rescuing the farmer and his family in a Wilderness battle makes the people in
the Dagger Falls bar friendly. (HILLSFAR had similar requirements.)

 Zhentil Keep is a nice place for a beginning party to visit. There are random
encounters with magic-users, clerics, and fighters. All of them have magical
weapons and armor. Get the +1 Crossbows and +1 Quarrels from the fighters, and
the AC-4 Bracers from the clerics and magic-users. You can sell the extra
Bracers for 9,000 gold each, and buy up some very nice magic items in the magic
shop. Arm each of your adventurers with magic missile wands. The extra-healing
potions will come in handy, too. The other magic items are luxuries which are
quickly used up. But if you can afford them, by all means, stock up! Pick up
some magic-scrolls for your magic-users to scribe.

 If you find waiting around for encounters a bit too tame for your tastes, bash
in a door. You'll soon have many encounters, as the guard is called out to deal
with you! (Save at the Inn before undertaking any encounters; some of them can
be very difficult.)

 If you visit the Standing Stone, you'll be directed to go South. When you feel
that you're ready to undertake your next bond adventure, go to Hap.

 On the way to Hap you'll meet some black dragons. Black dragons are
particularly vulnerable to Stinking Cloud spells. If you give them a belly ache
with this spell, they won't be able to use their deadly acid breath against you.

 THE VILLAGE OF HAP

 The Village of Hap is patrolled by five parties of Dark Elves. Don't avoid
these patrols. There are a set number of Dark Elves in the village. If you take
them piecemeal, patrol by patrol, the number of them in the final confrontation
(in the village barn) is lessened. Strip the first patrol of weapons and armor,
and distribute them among your party. Give the maces to your cleric. The Drow
have magical chain mail, swords, and maces. Equip your whole party with these
while you're in Hap (Village, Cave, and Tower). Unfortunately, these magical
items all disintegrate when you leave Hap.

 Drow Elves are almost magic-resistant, but not completely. Your first spells
may not be effective, but some of the next ones will be. Drow elves are most
vulnerable in hand-to-hand combat (particularly when you're using their own
weapons against them), and if you kill their cleric or magic-user first, he
won't be able to cast his spells! Missile wands are usually effective against
the Drow.

 If you cast Invisibility spells and avoid attacking for a few rounds, Drow
clerics and magic-users will waste all their spells aborting them because they
can't target your party. When they've used up their spells, you can cut them
down at will.

 You will find a general store in the village, and an Inn where you can safely
camp. If you do decide to leave Hap to get more training (and you should train
for new levels as you become eligible for them), don't let the NPC magic-user
whom you find in the village join your party. (He'll just get mad if you decide
to leave Hap without clearing the Tower first, and leave your party anyway.)

 After the battle in the barn, you will find a map showing the way to a cave.
When you leave Hap you will have the option to go to the cave.

 THE CAVE UNDER HAP

 Enter, and go west to the wall. If you turn south and east at the first
opening, then turn south again, and go through an arch, you will eventually find
Silk. (You can surrender to one of the many Drow Patrols you meet, and they will
take you to Silk, but they'll take some of your armor and weapons as
compensation for not killing you.) Silk will help you by applying another tattoo
(non-magical) to one of your party. This tattoo will let you pass some of the
numerous Drow Patrols you will find in the cave. (She does this in return for
your promise to chase the dragons from the tower, and to bring her a dragon's
egg.)

 After you enter the cave, go to the wall, turn north, and go to the north wall.
Turn west, go through the arch, and north to the wall. Turn east, north, and
west, and go through another arch. Keep going west to the wall, turn south, turn
the corner toward the west, go to the arch, and turn north. Here, you will find
a large party of Salamanders in their Sauna. Enter this room and battle them.
(They are vulnerable to Stinking Cloud and Missile spells). After the battle you
will find six treasure chests. Some of the chests contain very useful magical
items. One of them protects you from Dragon Breath; another protects you from
paralysis. You can use these scrolls for protection when you fight CrimDrac.

 To locate him, go south through an arch and all the way to the wall. Turn east,
go through the arch, turn south, and go through this arch. Now, go east, south,
east, south, and west through an arch. Go west to the wall, then head north to
another wall. Go east then north to the wall, turn west, go through the arch,
and meet CrimDrac. (He's either in this large room, or in the one to the south
of it.) To get to the tower, continue south through the arch, and turn west.

 CrimDrac is a Dracolich. He is vulnerable to missile spells and little else.
Spread your troops (watch out for his paralyzing breath), and hit him with all
the missile spells and missile wand blasts you can! Use the protection spell
before you meet him.

 You cannot escape battle with CrimDrac by surrendering to him. If you do,
you'll find you have to battle him later when leaving Hap. If you do surrender,
he'll escort your party to the top of the tower, and leave you to the whims of
Dracandos, the Red Wizard.

 THE TOWER OF DRACANDOS

 There are twelve assorted dragons at the top of the tower with Dracandos! The
dragon leader will parlay with you. If you chose the right option, he'll force
Dracandos to remove your bonds, then fly off with the other dragons leaving
Dracandos to _your_ mercy! (I chose the option of attacking Dracandos -- not the
dragons -- when it was offered to me.) After the dragons leave, pick up the egg.

 Dracandos will flee and lead you on a merry chase all the way down the tower
(several levels) before you finally catch up with him in the courtyard. There
will be many battles along the way with his Drow guards. One of these battles
will be with a very powerful Drow Lord with much better armor and weapons than
anything you have! You'll have a hot battle with him before winning. (I foun it
helpful to use a stalking horse and have a thief backstab him.) Also, have those
in your party who aren't hacking at him use ranged weapons.

 You'll find a piece of parchment that shows the location of the traps in the
tower. At random times, the parchment is booby-trapped to explode when you try
to pick it up.

 Along the way I found a room where we were challenged by a mage to duel with a
floating sphere. The loser will be sucked into infinity. The winner of this
battle seems to be determined randomly. I tried all my high-attribute
magic-users in this battle; all were defeated before the NPC magic-user, Akabar
Bel Akash, won. (Others have reported winning this battle with a mere fighter!)
Just keep trying different members of your party until you win. Save the game
before undertaking the battle.

 Most of the other battles are fairly easy until you come to a large group of
Wyverns. They're in the last room you'll come to before you enter the courtyard
(where Dracandos is dragging a bagful of scrolls around).

 If you're poisoned by a Wyvern, cast a Neutralize Poison spell, and the
character will survive (have one memorized in advance). Even if you're informed
that the character is dead, don't believe everything you read!

 You can defeat Dracandos (and company) with a large variety of tactics. I found
Hold Person spells worked on him, and Fireball spells decimated his friends. You
may wish to experiment with other means. The tactics he and his friends use are
random. Sometimes he damages himself and his party with his own spells!

 Dracandos wears AC2 Bracers and a +3 Ring of Protection. Equip one of your
magic-users with these. The robe is cursed: Don't wear it. He also has other
valuable items, including some scrolls. When you win the battle, you will be
notified that you have found The Helm of Dragons. You won't find it in your
inventory, but you do have it. It is the first of three items you need before
you're ready to go to Myth Drannor.

 In the courtyard is a door to the Cave. You can return to the cave and give the
dragon's egg to Silk for your reward. You can also leave the courtyard and go to
Essembra. You will have to battle CrimDrac (if you haven't already defeated him)
at the bridge, and that completes the second bond adventure.

 Undoubtedly, you will be ready for level increases at this point. Head for the
nearest Training Hall (in Essembra) and get them.

 CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS
          Part 3

 Now that you have completed two bond adventures, you will be able to take
advantage of the "Search Area" option that now shows up in the menu of the
various towns you visit. There are ruins, caves, and towers to explore outside
every city. (For those who played POOL, there's still a section outside Phlan
that needs clearing!) These alternate adventures are not necessary to win the
game, but they do provide a means for acquiring more experience points, scrolls,
magical armor, and weapons.

 If you visit the Standing Stone, you will be advised to seek the "green one"
next. The "green one" is Mogion of Moander, and she can be found in the Pit of
Yulash.

 YULASH

 Yulash is a city at war. Red Plume and Zhentarim forces battle for its
possession. Your party will be met by Red Plume forces as they enter the city
and taken to Red Plume headquarters in the northwest section of the city. After
an interview, the Commander will mention something about the tattoo that Silk
identified you with. You will be released and given a pass to leave, and a map.
Camp in the barracks for the night. In the morning head immediately for the Pit
(south, east, and north). Along the way, you may meet some Red Plume patrols,
but they'll leave you alone; however, you'll have to battle any Zhentarim terror
forces you encounter.

 You meet some Shambling Mounds dragging a body. Fighting them will give you a
magical weapon. Continue north to the Pit and enter. As soon as you do, a
cave-in will block your retreat. Go west and enter the first door to the south.
Go through the south door to another room, then through the door to th east. In
this room you will gain two powerful allies: Alias and Dragonbait. Equip these
two with your extra armor and weapons, and return to where you entered the Pit.

 This time, go west, pass the south door, and turn the corner going to the
south. Here you'll see a door to the east. Enter that door, continue east
through the next door, turn south, and continue south through the next door.
Eventually, you'll find a stairway to the next level.

 Go south through the door, turn west, and go as far as the first door that's
blocking your way. Instead of entering, turn north, and continue north through
the door to Mogian's Temple. You'll be met by Mogian -- the "green one" herself!
She'll unleash the Shards of Moander. Hold Person spells are effective against
Mogian, her priestesses, and the shards of her God. Stinking Cloud, Fireball,
and Magic Missile spells worked on the Shambling Mounds.

 Mogian has a Cloak of Displacement which will lower AC by two. Grab it! The
battle will also yield other treasures.

 After winning the series of battles, being released from another bond, and
finding the Gauntlets of Moandar (like the Dragon Helm, invisible to you),
search the Altar. You'll find a cache of precious jewels, and another map. This
is a map of level one (Entry #52), with the indicated stairway the one you used
to get to level two. Make your way back to level one and find your way out to
the Wilderness. Alias and Dragonbait will leave your party at this point.

 Since Yulash seems to be a much simpler, easier, and shorter adventure than the
others, you may decide that it, rather than Hap, should follow Tilverton. I
would agree except for several things: The advice given you at the Standing Rock
(go to Hap first), and the battles you do have in Yulash, are as difficult as
any you will find in the other adventures. And if you choose to explore all of
Yulash, you could have as many encounters.

 ADDITIONAL YULASH ENCOUNTERS

 Yulash has a large number of random encounters with two mages, one cleric, and
a differing number of fighters. They have fourth level spells and always come
into the fray already protected against Normal Missiles and Minor Globe of
Invulnerability. They cast Fire Shield at the first opportunity. Since the Minor
Globe of Invulnerability nullifies Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Stinking Cloud
spells, and the Fire Shield halves or nullifies the damage from Ice Storm
spells, they're hard to beat. I have been using lots of Hold Person spells.

 Most opponents have magic weapons and armor. The mages have AC4 Bracers, and
sometimes a Dart of Hornet Swarm. Also, there are a lot of +2 maces, +1 swords
(not 2-handed) weapons, +1 banded and +2 splint armor, and +1 Rings of
Protection in use.

 OLIVE RUSKETTLE

 After a brief stop in Ashabenford for training, return to Zhentil Keep to find
Olive Ruskettle, and to be released from the next to the last bond.

 Olive Ruskettle is a halfling thief who claims she is a bard. She is another
one of the interesting characters you will find in the novel (along with Alias
and Dragonbait).

 She makes a brief -- but key -- appearance in the game. She will guide you to
the beginning of the next bond adventure. You finally get her help by travelling
beyond the point where you are warned to save the game. She will take you to the
Temple of Bane where you can find and release Dimswart.

 Dimswart will clear up many things for you (Entry #12). After you have found
him, explore the rest of the temple. You will eventually find an altar. Search
it to locate the weapons which are hidden under a trapdoor. Among the weapons
are some +2 arrows. While you're searching, the Clerics of the Temple will
interrupt you many times. You will have as many battles as it takes to arm each
of your adventurers with High Cleric armor. Refuse the invitation to follow the
cloaked, hooded figure until you've finished searching the altar and arming your
troops. The figure (Medusa) will keep coming back until she's enticed you to the
altar of Dexam. Since there are no exits from the Temple (they will be sealed by
fanatical priests), there is nothing else to do but follow Medusa when you are
ready.

 THE ALTAR OF DEXAM

 Dexam is a Beholder. Beholders are very difficult to kill. Fortunately, it's
not necessary during this first meeting. In fact, he will do you a favor. He
will kill Fzoul (the evil lord responsible for your bond), and inadvertently
release your adventurers from their bond. During the following civil war between
the factions of Dexam and Fzoul, get out of the altar room as quickly as you
can, and head for the north exit. Unfortunately, you will have to fight a couple
of very tough battles with Minotaurs, Clerics, Zhentillian forces, etc., but
eventually you'll be able to either bash through the door, or use a Knock spell.
Camp and rest there. Do not move one step further.

 If you had chosen to exit through the east door, you would've eventually found
a dead elf (there is also a teleport square that will take you to him). This elf
has a rough map of the area (Entry #59).

 What you want your party to do after healing, memorizing new spells, and saving
their position is to work your way east, north, west, and finally south to the
exit into the Wilderness.

 Your party will have many battles on the way, including a large, difficult one
with Dexam and his troops. You'll also have several battles with Drow Lords and
other monsters. Use these battles to arm each of your characters with Drow Lord
armor and weapons. Drow Lord chain mail and shields will lower a characters' AC
to -7, and leave them with 12 movement points. Drow Lords also carry +5 swords!

 Camp, heal, memorize spells, and save your position after every battle. You may
have to move back to a safe place to do so. It isn't safe to rest in very many
places, but try moving a square or two away from wherever you last fought before
camping.

 The tactics you can use to defeat a Drow Lord are generally the same as before.
Protect yourself by using the terrain. Use Fireball spells on his companions,
then pick him apart with ranged weapons, and backstabs. Heal those who are
wounded. As you gain more +5 weapons and Drow Lord armor, use those weapons and
armor against the other Drow Lords. It will become easier to kill a Drow Lord as
you battle your way to your meeting with Dexam.

 When you meet Dexam, you might want to try using the Haste spell on a fighter
or paladin. He will be able to walk through Dexam's forces and destroy this
dangerous monster all by himself. (If Dexam isn't destroyed or engaged in
hand-to-hand combat immediately, he can cast devastating spells, including one
which will erase a character's statistics. He will not be dead; he'll be
_gone_!)

 Several Fireball spells will destroy Dexam's forces, including the dangerous
Medusa with him. You can also use a mirror against her so that her gaze will
reflect back and stone her! Other gamers have used Lightning Bolts and Ice Storm
spells to win this battle.

 After you win the battle you will get the final object (The Amulet of
Lathander). Again, it will be invisible in your inventory. Now that you possess
all three objects, when you return to the Standing Stone, you will discover that
the advice came from Tyranthraxus in disguise. He will reveal himself, tell you
to meet him in Myth Drannor, throw off his cloak, and vanish. Myth Drannor will
now appear as one of the options.

 MYTH DRANNOR

 There are two sections to Myth Drannor. Tyranthraxus is not in the first
section that you enter; he is in the section to the northeast of that section.

 The first section has many random encounters with Thri-Keen patrols; however,
if you give them the password (Tyranthraxus), they will leave you alone. There
is a ghostly meeting with an elf queen to the northwest. This meeting will get
you with a +5 bow and some blessed quarrels if you don't take the armor offered
as an option. If you do take the armor, all items you receive from the queen
will be cursed. You will also meet a Knight of Myth Drannor. He tells you they
will provide a diversion as you enter the Temple of Tyranthraxus.

 When you enter Myth Drannor, don't enter the building immediately to your right
(if you are facing north). Especially, do not enter the web to use a password
(KRRKKKK). It is a Rahshasa trick to trap you in a Giant Spider's sticky web.
(The clue for the password is given in one of the Search Area ruins.)

 You will find a path to the east in the northeast section. Take the path
through the woods to get into the second section, then immediately head north.

 You will have a chance to rescue a man from hell hounds. The man will tell you
of his cache. In the cache is a +5 Sword and The Girdle of Giant Strength. If
you take the other path to the second section you will meet a Rakshasa who will
become a member of your party if you help him fight his thieving uncle. This
leads into many encounters with Rakshasa patrols, however.

 The first door you find to the north is the door to the Temple of Tyranthraxus.
The next sequence is beyond your control. It runs like a movie script. You will
lose your final bond, and Tyranthraxus will leave his clerics behind to fight
you in his altar room.

 When you have a chance to leave, head out the door to the east, turn north, and
enter the middle door. Hug the wall to the left, and head north until you come
to a stairway to level two.

 On level two go north through a door, and turn to your right. Tyranthraxus is
in the second room to your right. Camp, save the game, and cast your spells. If
you want an easy battle, use the Dust of Disappearance in camp.

 If you want to save the Dust for the mass meeting of Beholders in the Tower of
Oxam, cast Minor Globe of Invulnerability spells on your mages, and anything
else that may be useful such as Enlarge, Prayer, and Invisibility. Get rid of
the enemy clerics and magic-users with Fireball spells. The blessed
quarrels/arrows can kill Rakshasa. Use Hold Person, Ice Storm, and everything
you can. Heal those who are wounded with the extra healing potions. It's a tough
battle, but the Knights of Myth Drannor will arrive at the end to heal your
wounded.

 The game then ends in fireworks and celebration. Congratulations!


 CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS
          Part 4

 THE SIDE ADVENTURES

 After you have completed the second bond adventure, you will have the choice of
using the Search Area option when you reach a city. Some of the Search Area
options lead you to the same place that selecting Enter the City does. For
example, Zhentil Keep and Myth Drannor have no separate places to explore, but
the Search Area option is on the menu.

 These side adventures can be used to gain experience points and levels, and to
find gold, magic weapons, scrolls, and armor. They all involve exploring mazes
-- some more difficult than others. Charles Miles commented: "The small-time
caves are a bear to map because they're made up of combinations of a small
number of different shaped areas. This gives the impression that: a) you were in
a room before when you really weren't; and, b) the caves were built by Drow
Elves Prefab Caves Inc."

 Shadowdale, Ashabenford, and Essembra caves have several levels. The next lower
level is filled with more difficult monsters than the previous.

 If you're lucky, you may find some +2 Long Bows and Composite Bows. What you
find is randomly selected, however, and your discoveries will vary greatly.

 You reach another level when you cross through a tunnel in a cave. There is a
walled city on the third level of the cave near Shadowdale, where you can find
someone who will transport you to the surface if you wish; Dracolich, Black
Dragons and Elf Lords abound here. You can find the Magistrate's kidnapped
daughter on the first level. Report back to him in the city of Shadowdale, and
he'll reward you for your efforts.

 The "Search Area" at Phlan leads you to an unconquered section of the city,
filled with "green one" priestesses and monsters: Shambling Mounds and
Vegepygmies. You can sometimes watch a ritual being performed in front of the
temple's altar.

 The ruins outside of Hillsfar features Phase Spiders, Margoyle, and Thri-Keen.
The ruins outside of Teshwave contain pirate treasure.

 Danny Low writes: "The difficulty of the side adventures is highly variable
Hillsfar and Teshwave are quite easy for fifth level characters; Phlan and
Voonlar are intermediate. Even the hard ones, like Shadowdale, are easy as long
as you don't go below the first level. They are clearly designed to allow the
characters to earn more XPs as they rise in levels. That is, the higher they
rise in level, the larger the XP rewards become, which helps them rise to the
next level.

 "The harder side adventures randomly give you MU scrolls. This is very nice for
Scribing. The training fights you encounter on the roads and wilderness are also
easy, but these don't give much loot.

 "I also had numerous confrontations with Dracolich, Black Dragons and Elf Lords
in Shadowdale, but there appears to be a limit to how many Elf Lords and
Dracolich you have to fight. Once they're dead, there are no more; just wimpy
Black Dragons, Efreets, et al."

 The Tower of Oxam is at Dagger Falls and is the best (and most rewarding) of
the side adventures. When you select Search Area at Dagger Falls, you find
yourself in a second Magic Shop. This is a nice surprise since Zhentil Keep i
barred to you once you finish the bond adventure there. If you choose to explore
the Tower, you begin in the foyer. You can go up in the tower (and sometimes see
the shade of Cadorna wandering the tower), or down below, where you will
eventually find the mass meeting of the Beholder Corps.

 THE MASS MEETING OF THE BEHOLDERS

 If you want to go to the mass meeting, go west into the sitting room. Then, go
south (where you will find the stairs up), go east through the door, and south
through a door (where you will battle a group of minotaurs). Go through the east
door and you will be in the cave. Keep going east until you can turn south. Go
through the third door from the left (facing south). There is a door to the
west. Go through it and follow a path west (past several rooms to the north).
Then go north, west, north, west, south, east, south, east (through an archway)
down a long hallway, and through the door (you'll be in a large cavern). Turn
south and hug the wall until you come across a door to the west. Through that
door lies several rooms. One of them will be the room where the mass meeting of
the Mulmaster Beholder Corps is being held. You are invited!

 When you enter the room, your computer screen will read, "You enter a room
dominated by a large conference table. On each side is an assemblage of
Rakshasa, Drow, Priests, and Beholders. They are discussing the fate of
adventurers." Your options are "Flee in Panic," and "Throw Caution to the
Winds." There are 8 Rakshasa, 10 High Priests, 10 Drow Lords, and 15 Beholders
in the room.

 The battle is very easy if you camp and use the "Dust of Disappearance" before
entering.

 If you choose not to use the dust, here is the way Mark E. Loenichen did it,
playing the IBM-PC version 1.0:

 Assumptions going in (e.g., untested): Cast Enlarge and Haste on everyone. Make
sure they're all at maximum movement points on entry. Ready their armor only at
the moment of conflict. (This is a general rule, not to be taken literally.)

 The Blink spell seemed to work better than Invisibility for avoiding undesired
magic spells and physical hits. If you can't Blink, use regular invisibility.
This provides only minimal protection during initial contact when you are trying
to gain better tactical ground.

 Party make-up: All my characters had been through POOL and HILLSFAR, so they
had quite a few hit points (two had 100+, one 99, the others in the 60's). Have
two eleventh level mages, two tenth level clerics, and one twelfth level thief
(very important for Drow Lord fighting) in your party.

 Working Spells/Potions (all purchased): Extra Healing and Potions of Speed. I
spent everything I had to purchase every Javelin of Piercing in the store!

 Essential Observations: Drow Lords run faster than anyone else. Cold spells
work on Drow Lords better than anything else. The -2 AC loss for Stink Cloud
victims can be essential. Curse works only on clerics and isn't worth it.
Nothing bothers Beholders or the Rakshasa magicians except force. A well-placed
backstab to a Drow Lord from a Hastened, Enlarged party member can do wonders
for the party's morale.

 Specific Strategy: Clumped-up groups of people are "easy" pickings, especially
if the ones trapped are the nastiest. Survive at the cost of an easy kill: In
other words, when a Beholder approaches within lethal distance, run! Try to get
the enemy to use up all his spells.

 Tactics: Hit the Drow Lords and priests with Confuse. Not many will be
affected, but it's enough to eventually drain most of their combat spells. Your
first maneuver should be to escape from the room. Run up and all the way to the
back of the room (behind walls, of course). Eventually, all the enemies will
congregate in the back of the room. Drow Lords and Rakshasa will be the most
prominent in the crowd. I positioned my party around the walls to hold some of
the monsters in, and set up a "sucker play" wherein I enticed others to come out
of the room (one or two at a time only). Drow Lords were definitely more
desirable one at a time, but I managed three once -- with great difficult and at
the expense of using a lot of my Heal Potions. If the going got rough or looked
hairy, I would run to the back of the room to recluster the enemy, then I would
cast Healing spells and drink Healing Potions.

 There was a "YOU HAVE WON" message awarding 22,000+ experience points at th end
of the battle. The loot from the room (as far as equipment and scrolls were
concerned) was not impressive, but I did get enough money to make up for the
expense of the Javelins.

 The back door led to a 2-square (I think) room with another door. Behind, the
second door was _great_ treasure. I received another 10,000 experience points
and a bunch of magic weapons. The weapons were not impressive; mostly +1's with
one or two +2's.

 The room farthest to the back was a single-square sort of room. I was using the
Search Area option when I entered. Rakshasa are not immune to stink clouds. Once
they're coughing, they can be paralyzed with the Wand of Paralysis. I was not
able to paralyze them at any other time, though I only tried two or three times
when they weren't "stinking." The Drow Lords are affected by paralysis, too, but
I think they have to be hacked up pretty bad; again, I believe my only success
in this was when they were under the influence of Stinking Cloud.


 CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS
          Part 5

 COMBAT

 Winning the battles is the hardest part of playing the game. Tactics are the
key to victory. This section will attempt to introduce you to various tactics
with which I have had some success.

 Generally, give the highest priority to targeting enemy magic-users to keep
them from casting spells each round. Eliminate helpless monsters before they
become active again, and concentrate your attacks on one enemy at a time.

 MANEUVERABILITY

 It is much easier to fight battles when your characters all have 12 movement
points (or as close to it as your armor will allow in the beginning of the
game). Do not overload your characters; don't get greedy by picking up all the
treasure you find. When you find that your characters are overloaded, lighten
their loads!

 IF YOU OUTNUMBER THE ENEMY

 If you don't have sufficient spells to kill all the enemies, mass your attacks
against one of them at a time. Follow the Quick Start advice: "It's better to
kill one than to wound two."

 Experiment with your thief's backstab abilities. Use the delay command when
each character's chance to move comes up. This allows the monster to move first
so that the direction in which it's facing won't change. Then, have a fighter or
cleric attack the enemy from one direction, and have your thief attack from
directly opposite your fighter.)

 The backstab is one of the most effective weapons in the game. The damage
increases as your thief gains levels. Contrary to the manual, a multi-classed
thief can wear heavy armor while using the backstab, and he can use it against
large monsters.

 IF THE ENEMY OUTNUMBERS YOU

 Find good, defensive positions that won't allow the enemy to find a way around
your flanks. Use the terrain; force the enemy to come at you through doorways
and narrow openings in walls. Set your party up next to trees to protect them
from being surrounded. Mass as many of your attacks against as many single
targets as possible.

 RANGED WEAPONS

 If only your party has ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, slings, and attack
spells, such as Fireball, etc.), try to begin the attack at the longest possible
range. Keep a front line of fighters and clerics to protect your archers and
magic users.

 If both sides have ranged weapons, make the enemy spellcasters your primary
targets.

 If only the enemy has ranged weapons, attack at close range. It's much harder
for the enemy to use his bow or magic against you when you're beating on his
head with a sword! Offensive spells act very much like bows or weapons. Using
them on an enemy magic-user prevents them from casting for the rest of the turn.
The magical "+" bows are, of course, the best ranged weapons to have, as well as
"+" arrows and quarrels.

 SINGLE TARGET SPELLS

 Magic Missile is the single best target spell. It has the longest range and
causes the most consistent damage.

 Spiritual Hammer is only effective at close range, and even then, it doesn't
cause much damage.

 Cloudkill, Flame Strike, and Slay Living are short range offensive spells that
vary greatly in effectiveness. Experiment with them.

 Charm Person can turn an enemy into a friend. It only works on one human-shaped
creature.

 MASS ATTACK SPELLS

 Fireballs are the spell of choice, if you have them available.

 Ice Storm and Cone of Cold cause less damage, and can only be used at shorter
distances. They are effective against monsters resistant to fire.

 Fear causes all enemies within a rather large area to flee; however, if they
are nearby, you can very easily affect your own troops.

 Confusion will interrupt between 2 and 16 monsters from doing whatever they
were doing.

 Lightning Bolt is the enemy magic-users' favorite spell. It can be effective
against up to eight targets; however, it is usually only effective against two
or three.

 Sleep, Hold Person, Hold Monster, and Stinking Cloud can make the enemy
helpless sitting ducks for a fighter's or archer's single blow.

 If the enemy has the ability to use mass attack magic against you, spread your
party out. Most mass attack spells have limited range.

 Charm Monster works on all living creatures but is only effective on one
monster at a time, and the monster must be fourth level or higher.

 DEFENSIVE SPELLS

 Prayer, Bless, Protection from Evil, and Protection from Evil 10' Radius are
protection spells you can cast in camp before a battle. I preferred to use
Prayer since it affected the saving throws and THACO of the whole party, and not
just a single target.

 Bestow Curse reduces the target's THACO and saving throw by four.

 Invisibility 10' Radius is very useful to cast in camp before a battle. It
makes your entire party invisible until they attack. Do not attack right away.
Use your enemies' confusion (magic-users will waste spells by trying to cast
them, and aborting the spells when they can't find a target) to get all your
characters in position for backstabs, Lightning Bolts, etc. Have all your
characters choose delay, let the enemy take his turn, then attack all at once.
(Your THACO in melee is reduced by 4.)

 The Minor Globe of Invulnerability (protects the caster from incoming first,
second, or third level spells) is perhaps the most valuable protective spell you
can have your magic-users cast in camp before a major battle.

 OTHER SPELLS

 Enlarge makes the recipient larger and stronger. The higher the level of the
caster, the stronger the character. It should be cast in camp.

 Haste doubles the character's movement and number of melee attacks per round.
However, it also ages them by one year.

 Slow can be used against targets using Haste to negate the spell. (WARNING: IBM
version 1.0 has a bug that causes the game to freeze when Slow is cast.)

 Neutralize Poison is valuable in restoring a poisoned character to life. Cast
it either during the battle when the character is poisoned, or in camp before
resting. Do not be fooled by the message saying that the character is dead. They
can be brought back to life with the spell.

 Slow Poison will only revive a person for the duration of the spell (one hour
per caster's level).

 Feeblemind and Fumble are not always effective because the target is allowed
saving throws.

 SPECIAL MAGIC ITEMS

 The Necklace of Missiles casts a series of fireball spells. It is found in the
sewers of Tilverton.

 The Wand of Missiles casts low-level missile spells. This is the best of the
items you can buy at the Magic Shop. The other offensive spells sold there are
Hornets Nest Darts (excellent weapon for a single classed magic-user -- get
several), and Lance of Piercing (highly recommended for use at the Mass Meeting
of the Beholder Corps).

 The Dust of Disappearance is the most powerful weapon in the game! With it, you
can win any battle. Unfortunately, it can only be used once. It is an
invisibility spell that keeps working even while you're attacking! Ready it and
use it in camp before either the battle with Tyranthraxus to win the gam or to
win the battle against the mass meeting of beholders in the Tower of Oxam. It is
found in the thieves' treasure room in the Thieves Guild below Tilverton.

 The Dwarfs Girdle is beneficial primarily to Dwarves in raising strength
attributes. Experiment with it, however, to see what it will do to each of your
troops when readied. (WARNING: In IBM version 1.0, using it may cause the
attribute to change to an unrealistic number beyond the maximum allowed. You're
better advised to sell the Girdle.)

 The Ioun Stones do various things to attributes only if the characters aren'
already at their maximum attribute allowed. See the list below.

 (WARNING: Using Ioun Stones in IBM version 1.0 may cause the attributes to
change to unrealistic numbers way beyond maximum. You're better off selling the
stones.)

 Pale blue rhomboid -- +1 Strength
 Scarlet and blue sphere -- +1 Intelligence
 Incandescent blue sphere -- +1 Wisdom
 Deep red sphere -- +1 Dexterity
 Pink rhomboid -- +1 Constitution
 Pink and green sphere -- +1 Charisma
 Pale green prism -- +1 experience level
 Clear spindle -- character needs no food or water
 Iridescent spindle -- character can survive without air
 Pearly white spindle -- character regenerates 1 hit point per turn
 Pale lavender ellipsoid -- absorbs spells up to 4th level
 Lavender and green ellipsoid -- absorbs spells up to 8th level
 Vibrant purple prism -- stores 2-12 levels of spells
 Dusty rose prism -- +1 protection

 Any Ioun Stone described as "dull gray" is burned-out and useless.

 You will not find all of the stones listed above. The list is from the AD&D
manual.

 MY FAVORITE MONSTERS

 Some of the monsters are difficult to kill simply because they resist magic.

 Beholder: Use Haste on your strong, fast fighters and quickly eliminate a
single beholder (or even a small party of them) with magical weapons. Don't
waste time casting magic spells. They will block most (if not all) of them. You
can also hide behind walls to stay out of range of their spells. Protection
spells may protect you from some of their spells. They have a Disappearing ray
that will not only kill your character, but wipe out his stats! (His condition
will be GONE, which is deader than dead.)

 Black Dragon: I have had the most success with Fireballs, and quickly
eliminated the Black Dragons before they could use their breath weapons. Don't
let your party bunch together. One 45-point hit of acid breath can almost
decimate your whole party! Missile spells are also effective. Stinking Cloud
prevents them from using their acid breath, as well as making them helpless at
times.

 Dracolich: In defeating Crimdrac, spreading out, and casting multiple missil
spells from a distance was very effective. (Each of my adventurers used a
missile wand if they didn't have a regular (and more powerful) missile spell.

 Medusa: I never had any problems with Medusas. Burn them to a crisp with
fireball spells from a distance before they can get close and use their Gaze
that turns you into stone. I have heard reports that using a Mirror against them
when they cast the gaze turns them into stone! (They also can't use their gaze
if you are invisible!)

their favorite spell: the Lightning Bolt. (The Minor Globe of Invulnerability
will protect your magic-users.)

 Thri-Keen: You won't meet many of them until you get to Myth Drannor, and then
they will respond to Tyranthraxus (the password), and leave you alone.

 Tyranthraxus (the Storm Giant): Protect your three magic-users with the Minor
Globe of Invulnerability, and the Lightning Bolts he throws will be harmless.
You can cast Invisibility 10' Radius, which should protect the others, as long
as they don't attack anyone. Of course, The Dust of Disappearance will keep
everyone safe from being targeted by spells, and Potions of Extra-Healing will
help restore the HPs you will lose when you bump into his various bodyguards in
the final confrontation.
