 Welcome to another Network Trainer.This Trainer is for DUNE 2 by Westwood
Studios.I personally think it's one the best and most well thought out
games I have ever played.For those of you enjoying it this Trainer will
make some things in the game alot EASIER.

 With this Trainer you will be able to build Anything INSTANTLY,have 10,000
credits at your disposal,advance to the next mission with a single keystroke,
and with the Army Trainer you will be able to make ALL of your Ground Forces
for your particular House INVUNERABLE.

 To use the Trainer just UNZIP it into your Dune2 game directory.Type DUN2TRNS
in that directory and you will be presented with an opening screen reminding
you of the various Trainer functions.From there just press any key and the
Trainer will load Dune2 for you.

 Here's a more detailed description of the various Trainer Functions and how
to use them while playing the game:

 F4 - 10,000 Credits (ON/OFF).When you press the F4 key during the game the
      number of credits will begin to scroll upwards at a dizzing speed
      until it reaches 10,000.Once there it will remain at 10,000 no matter
      how much you spend.Press F4 again and it will scroll back to the amount
      of credits you are supposed to have and credits will be deducted normally
      as you spend them.

 F5 - INSTANT Construction (ON/OFF).Press F5 and whenever you build something
      will happen INSTANTLY.No more waiting for it by %'s.This will work for
      anything in the game you must build or manufacture.Press F5 again and it
      will go back to normal.

GREY ASTERIK -
       This Toggles ON/OFF the Army trainer.By pressing it once a monitor is
      setup at the damage code for targeted units.Depending on what flags
      you set by the other functions (F6,F7,F8) it will control which army
      gets damage or not.Pressing it again and it will be turned OFF.

GREY PLUS -
       This is the GREY PLUS on the NUMBER PAD.Pressing this will automatically
      complete your current mission as if you have done all that is needed
      with great success.It advances you to the next mission as if you
      met all your goals in other words.Note the Strategy Map will be updated
      accordingly.

 F6 - When the Army Trainer is ON (GREY ASTERIK) this will make ALL the
      Atreides Ground Troops INVUNERABLE.Press it again and they get normal
      damage.

 F7 - When the Army Trainer is ON (GREY ASTERIK) this will make ALL the Ordos
      Ground Troops INVUNERABLE.One more press and everything goes back to
      Normal.

 F8 - When the Army Trainer is ON (GREY ASTERIK) pressing F8 will make ALL the
      Harkonnen Ground Forces INVUNERABLE.Press F8 again and they are Normal.



  NOTES :

 The Army Trainer is a bit confusing so I'll explain it a little better.First
you have to Press the GREY * Key (Located by the Number Pad).This Turns ON the
Army Trainer itself.What this does is set up the routines to make changes to
how and WHO the game gives out Damage to.

 Then select F6,F7 or F8 depending on which House you are currently playing.In
other words if you are the Ordos select F7 to protect your Ordos Troops.If you
press F6 or F8 you will be protecting your Enemy and that wouldn't make much
sense now would it?

 Also you can select F6,F7 or F8 BEFORE you turn on the Army Trainer (GREY *).
All these keys really do is set flags that the Army Trainer checks and acts
upon depending on what is set or NOT set.

 For ALL Trainer functions in Dune 2 once you activate them they remain ON
for the WHOLE game until you turn them OFF again manually.So if you are playing
the Ordos and set the Army Trainer ON and Protect them but decide you want to
play a different House,MAKE SURE you remeber to toggle OFF that protect for
the Ordos and Toggle it back to the House you change to or your now Ordos
enemies will be Invunerable.

 For fun you can Protect ALL 3 houses and see who wins the race to destroy the
structures first!Please note that the Army Trainer does not affect the
Emperor's Troops (Sardukon) or the Fremen Units.

 The Trainer Engine has been modified so that the Beep from the PC Speaker
is barely auidble.It's just a high pitched tone now to let you know it
accepted the keypress.This is for all you late night and office gameplayer's
that were getting annoyed (and caught!) because of the beep before.And as
always all Trainers are written in 100% .ASM for fastest performance in the
smallest of space.

 Also the for the immediate future all of my Trainers will be archived with
the older version of PKZIP V1.1.Alot of people have not upgraded to 2.04
yet (you should BTW.It's really GREAT!) and had trouble trying to uncompress
previous Trainers.Sorry for the trouble.V1.1 is compatible with 2.04 so it
should be easier for everyone to use.

 A note on the Engine these Trainers are written.Because the opeing and closing
screens are in ANSI format if you do not use ANSI.SYS or some other ANSI
driver the screens will come out as garbage on the screen and make alot of
mess/noise.To conserve space a detector for ANSI is left out as is an error
handler for that case.ANSI.SYS can be found with your DOS device drivers and
variations of it can be located almost anywhere in the PD world.I apologize to
anyone experiencing troubles due to this.

 There are no known problems so far with the above trainer(s)/editors so enjoy.
