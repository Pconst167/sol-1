Rambo ]I[ Cheat V2.0 Information file - an API Release

*** NOTICE!!! ***

This cheat will only work on the FiRM's version of Rambo III!!!!!
Beta test cheat unless someone solves the game, and then it works!

Well, this game is a deluxe version of Castle Wolfenstein. There are lots
of rooms to explore and many things to find. Some of the things I found are:

Kevlar vest - used to protect yourself against explosives
Glow tube - view dark rooms
IR-goggles - detects IR laser beams in hallways
IR-battery - powers IR-goggles
Rubles - ???
Flag - Russian Flag
Crossbow - used to fire arrows or explosive arrows
Pistol - another weapon
Silencer - used with the pistol to silence noise
?-goggles - view yellow
Mine Detector - used to locate mines outside of the complex
Mine Detector battery - powers mine detector
Portrait - junk, worthless
Vodka - Drink it and you move abnormally
Old Boots - junk, worthless
Dirty Laundry - junk, worthless
Bone - Give to a dog and it'll ignore you
Explosive chest - Lose energy
First aid kit - increases your energy
Key - opens certain steel doors
Grenade - good for blowing up the guy that can't be stabbed.
Rubber gloves - protects yourself from electric door
Machine gun - another weapon
Bullets - for pistol
Clips - for machine gun

The game is basically HARD! If you should mess up, you will start all over.
I have not been able to locate Colonel Trautman so I haven't tested this
cheat fully. However, Rambo is immune to virtually anything. Rambo will
lose energy IF you throw a grenade or explosive arrow and it ignites near
you. Other than that, nothing else harms you as far as I know. Touching
the electric door or land mines will not kill you, but block your path and
restore your energy to maximum. Use the mine detector to walk around land
mines on the outside. Press at least two buttons somewhere in the compound
to turn off the electricity of certain doors. Always keep your keys.
They are VERY valuable!

To make this cheat work without the extra subroutine in version one, I
had to edit the index register and bypass one of the "lose energy"
routines. Thus, everything is the same except that now you MUST kill the
enemy or you just walk through them. So if you are the killer type, go
ahead and stab, shoot, or throw grenades at them.

To run the cheat, place the batch file in your RAMBO directory. Then type
"RUNCHEAT" to execute. You will notice that the batch file will edit the
game while it is loading. Just wait a while and answer the configuration
questions if they pop up.

Thanks to Lord Blix for cracking this cool game. I'm glad the encryption
was not intact like Software Surgeon's crack of Operation Wolf, or I
couldn't possibly find the cheat.

Friendly hellos to all API, FiRM, INC, PSI, and TRIAD members.
