                                Doc Notes:

              Parts of the manual will refer to certain tables.
              the tables are viewable and printable seperately
              from the Tables & Scans SubMenu.
              
              Other parts of the manual will refer to GIF pics.
              If you have the condensed version, you have no
              GIFs to view.  If you have the complete version,
              and VPIC in your DOS PATH, you may view these
              GIFs from the Tables & Scans SubMenu.

              The last time we released a doc with scans, like
              a moron I included my own copy of VPIC which was
              configured to my own machine.  This was really
              stupid of me, so I just want to apologize to whom
              ever experienced a problem because of this.  In
              the future I will just rely on you having VPIC
              in your path rather than including a copy in
              the archive.

  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


  One year ago, the forces of evil were united under the powerful aurak
  draconian, Myrtani.  He had once again uncovered the method of corrupting
  dragon eggs into draconians.  Aided by his Death Knight ally, Sir Lebaum, he
  was able to seize control of central Krynn and to field a dangerous army of
  draconians and undead.

  As the Solamnic forces converged upon the region, a small band of stalwart
  heroes uncovered Myrtani's secret plans: to suddenly generate a huge army,
  and ambush the Solamnic forces.  Myrtani hoped to slay key leaders in one
  swift action, and then crush the remaining, disorganized resistance.  Magic
  rituals discovered in a stolen tome would allow him to turn stolen dragon
  eggs into draconians en masse.  The eggs were well hidden and Solamnic scouts
  had missed them after the War of the Lance.

  A small band of heroes were able to slip into Myrtani's stronghold in Kernen
  and slay this foul minion of the evil goddess, Takhisis, before the magic
  could be used.  Without the draconian force, the Knights of Solamnia we able
  to rout the evil army and bring peace to the region again.



  ===================[IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES]=========================

  The major cities of the region are Kalaman and Vingaard Keep.  They loosely
  administer the large number of small villages in the region.  These include
  the dwarven village of Turef, the gnomish village of Quazle and the human
  towns of Cerberus and Cekos.  Many wars have been fought in this region,
  leaving several ruined old castles and forts.  Man have evil reputations and
  should be avoided.  Perhaps the most famous of them is Dargaard Keep.  Once
  the home of the famous Knight of the Rose, Lord Soth, it now lies abandoned
  and decayed.



  ============================[CHARACTERS AND PARTIES]=========================

  Individual persons called characters make up your party of adventurers.  They
  can be any one of several races and have any number of different skills.
  Some will be warriors, some priests, some mages and others may be thieves.
  Each brings his own skills and talents.


  -={The Player Races}=-

  There are seven races for player characters (PCs) in the world of Krynn.
  Each offers unique strengths and weaknesses.  For example, humans can
  advance without limits in any class (profession), while only non-humans can
  have more than one class at a time.  Kender have limits to their maximum
  strength, while elves receive bonuses to their dexterity.  The following
  sections describe the races and several charts outline specific bonuses and
  limitations.

  HILL DWARVES are a stubborn and rough race of sturdy workers and craftsmen.
  They are especially resistant to magic and poison.  During combat, dwarves
  receive bonuses when attacking goblins or hobgoblins and are adept at
  dodging the attacks of ogres and giants.  Dwarves can be fighters, thieves,
  rangers, clerics of Reorx or mixed classes.

  MOUNTAIN DWARVES are somewhat clannish and more refined than their Hill
  Dwarf cousins, otherwise they are nearly identical.  Mountain dwarves may
  be fighters, paladins, thieves, clerics of Reorx or mixed classes.

  SILVANESTI ELVES (HIGH ELVES) are a tall, arrogant and long-lived race.
  They are nearly immune to Sleep and Charm spells and are adept at finding
  hidden doors. During combat, elves receive bonuses when attacking with long
  or short swords and bows.  They cannot be raised from the dead.  Silvanesti
  elves can be fighters, paladins, mages, clerics, rangers and mixed classes.

  QUALINESTI ELVES are slightly smaller and friendlier than their Silvanesti
  brethren, but they have identical abilities and bonuses.  Qualinesti elves
  can be fighters, rangers, mages, thieves, clerics and mixed classes.

  HALF-ELVES are hybrids, with many of the virtues of both humans and elves.
  They are resistant to Sleep and Charm spells are adept at finding hidden
  doors.  Half-elves can be fighters, knights, paladins, mages, clerics,
  thieves, rangers and mixed classes.

  KENDER are a small people characterized by an absolute lack of fear and an
  insatiable curiosity.  They are especially resistant to magic and poison
  and have the special ability to taunt intelligent opponents.  When kender
  successfully taunt, an opponent will attack in a mindless rage, suffering a
  loss of combat effectiveness.  The preferred weapon of the kender is the
  hoopak, part stall sling part metal shod staff, which only they can use.
  Kender receive bonuses to hit with hoopaks and are deadly accurate shots.
  They can be thieves, fighters, rangers, clerics or mixed classes.

  HUMANS are the most common player-race in the world of Krynn.  They can be
  fighters, mages, clerics, thieves, paladins, rangers and Knights but not
  mixed classes.  Only humans and half-elves can be Knights.


  -={Ability Scores}=-

  Every character has six randomly generated ability scored as explained
  below.  These scores fall within a range determined by the race and class
  of the character.  The basic values range from 3 (low) to 18 (high) and
  there are charts of limitations, modifiers and bonuses included in this
  SCD-Dox presentation.

  Depending on the character class, one or more of these abilities will be a
  prime requisite.  A prime requisite is an ability especially valuable to a
  given class.  For example, strength is key for fighters wisdom for clerics.
  Most characters receive bonus experience points when their prime requisite
  scores are 16 or greater.

  Non-human characters may receive modifiers to the basic ability scores to
  reflect differences between the races.  Dwarves for instance, get a +1
  constitution bonus and may have a maximum constitution of 19 instead of 18.
  When a character is generated with the CREATE NEW CHARACTER command, all
  racial modifiers are calculated automatically.

  STRENGTH (STR) is the measure of a character's physical power, muscle mass
  and stamina.  Fighter-type characters may have exceptional strengths
  greater than 18 which are indicated by a percent value
  (01,02,03,...,98,99,00) following the base strength.  High strength
  increases a character's combat ability with melee weapons.  Strength also
  determines how much a character can carry without becoming encumbered and
  slowed in combat.

  INTELLIGENCE (INT) is the measure of how well a character can learn.
  Intelligence can limit how far mage characters can advance and what levels
  of spells they can cast.

  WISDOM (WIS) is the measure of a character's ability to understand the ways
  of the world and to interact with the world.  Clerics receive bonus spells
  for high wisdom and it may limit what level spells they can cast.

  DEXTERITY (DEX) is the measure of a character's manual dexterity and
  agility.  Thieves especially benefit from high dexterity.  Dexterity
  affects how well a character can use ranged weapons (bows, dart, etc.) when
  he moves in a combat round and how difficult he is to hit combat.

  CONSTITUTION (CON) is the measure of a character's overall health.
  Fighters receive one extra hit point per hit die for each point of
  constitution above 14.  Non-fighters receive similar benefits except they
  receive a maximum of two extra hit points per level (no benefits for
  constitutions above 15).  These bonuses are only given until characters
  reach about 10th-level (depending on class).  A character's constitution
  also determines the maximum number of times that character can be raised
  from the dead and the chance of a resurrection attempt being successful.
  Every time a character is successfully resurrected, he loses 1 point of
  constitution.

  CHARISMA (CHA) is the measure of how others react to a character.  Charisma
  is sometimes a factor when encountering NPCS--the higher a character's
  charisma, the more that character can persuade others to do what he wants.
  The character with the highest charisma should be the active character when
  dealing NPCs.


  -={Character Classes}=-

  A character must belong to at least one character class.  Non-human
  characters can have more than one class at the same time.  A non-human
  character with multiple classes has more playing options, but he increases
  in level more slowly because his experience points are divided evenly among
  all his classes.

  Characters receive HP, spells and abilities based on their class, level and
  (sometimes) ability scores.  Refer to the tables to find the number and
  size of hit dice a character receives and the number of spells the
  character can memorize.

       Note: Dice is the term used to describe the range for randomly
             generated number. A d6 die has a range from 1 through 6,
             a d10 has a range from 1 through 10.

  CLERICS have spells bestowed on them by their deities and can fight wearing
  armor and using crushing (not edged or pointed) weapons.  After selecting a
  deity, clerics may only choose alignments appropriate to their deity.  Each
  of the deities extends special abilities to his followers.  For more
  information, see the Deities section in this manual.  Clerics have the
  ability to sometimes turn away or even destroy undead creatures such as
  skeletons or zombies.  This power increases as the cleric increases in
  level.  The prime requisite for clerics is wisdom.

  FIGHTERS can fight with any armor or weapons but they cannot cast magic
  spells.  Fighters can have exceptional strength and gain additional HP
  bonuses if they have a Constitution of 17+.  The prime requisite for
  fighters is strength.

  MAGES have powerful spells, but can use no armor and few weapons.  They can
  only memorize those spells available in their magical spell books or use
  scrolls.  In the world of Krynn, the power of mages is moderated by the
  three moons and mages are divided into three orders based on alignment.  A
  mage's power fluctuates with the cycles of the moon that influences his
  order.  For more information on the orders and moons see the Magic section.
  The prime requisite for mages is intelligence.

  PALADINS can fight with any armor or weapons, are totally immune to disease
  and can cast a few clerical spells once they reach ninth-level.  Paladins
  can have exceptional strength and gain additional HP bonuses as fighters.
  They are somewhat resistant to spells and poison.

  Because of their special nature, certain magical abilities are conferred on
  them by deities.  They can turn undead creatures as if they were a cleric
  two levels below their current level and are always surrounded by the
  equivalent of a Protection from Evil 10' Radius spell.  Once a day paladins
  may heal two HP of damage per their level.  They can also Cure Disease once
  a week at 1st-5th levels, twice a week a 6th to 10th and three times week
  at 11th to 14th level.  At ninth-level, paladins gain the ability to cast
  clerical spells, but they cannot use clerical scrolls.

  Paladins must be of lawful good alignment and have ability scores of at
  least 9 in intelligence and constitution, at least 12 in strength, at least
  13 in wisdom and at least 17 in charisma.  The prime requisites for
  paladins are strength and wisdom.

  RANGERS ca fight with any armor or weapons.  Rangers can have exceptional
  strength and gain additional HP bonuses as fighters.  They do additions
  damage in combat when fighting giant-class creatures.  No more than three
  rangers can join one party.

  Rangers are very in tune with nature and gain the ability to cast druidic
  spells when they reach eighth-level.  At night-level they gain the ability
  to cast mage spells.  Rangers can never use scrolls of any type.

  Rangers must be of good alignment and have ability scores of at least 13 in
  strength and intelligence and at least 14 in wisdom and constitution.  The
  prime requisites for rangers are strength, intelligence and wisdom.

  SOLAMNIC KNIGHTS are the pride of the chivalric honor in the world of
  Krynn.  The knights are divided into three orders: the Knights of the
  Crown, the Knights of the Sword and the prestigious Knights of the Rose.
  All are renowned for their bravery and skill at arms.  Knights begin the
  game with the Solamnic Plate Mail, long sword +1 and a shield.

  Knights are valuable for their leadership ability in combat.  Whenever a
  party with a Knight enters combat, he makes a leadership check.  If the
  check is successful, all NPCs in the party come under your control like
  regular PCs.  Chances of success increase dramatically as a Knight rises
  through the three orders.

  Knights must take a vow of poverty and so they tithe a large part of their
  monies and treasures back to the orders.  Knights of the Crown will tithe
  10% to their order whenever they enter an outpost.  Knights of the Sword
  and the Rose will give up everything except 20 steel pieces when they
  tithe.  When Knights of the Sword or the Rose become sixth-level, they gain
  the ability to cast some clerical spells.

  If a Knight of either of the first two orders (Crown or Sword) is of
  sufficient level and has high enough ability scores,  he may petition the
  next higher order for admission.

            Note: Knights receive experience bonuses for doing
                  knightly deeds and not for meeting prime
                  requisites minimums.

  To join the Knights of the Sword a knight must have the following minimum
  ability scores: STR 12, INT 9, WIS 13, DEX 9, CON 15.

  To join the Knights of the Rose a knight must have the following minimum
  ability scores: STR 15, INT 10, WIS 13, DEX 12, CON 15.

  THIEVES can fight with swords, short bows and slings and wear leather
  armor.  In combat they do additional damage 'back stabbing', which is
  described in the Combat section.  Thieves also have special skills for
  opening locks and removing traps.  The prime requisite for thieves is
  dexterity.

  MULTI-CLASS are non-human characters who belong to two or more classes at
  the same time.  The character's experience points are divided among each of
  the classes, even after the character can no longer advance in one or more
  of those classes.  The character's hit points per level are averaged among
  the classes.  The multi-class character gains all the benefits of all
  classes with regard to weapons and equipment.


                                -={Alignment}=-

  Alignment is the philosophy a character lives by and can affect how NPCs
  and some magic items in the game react to the character.  The following
  alignments are available to Player Characters.

  LAWFUL GOOD characters believe in the rule of law for the good of all.

  LAWFUL NEUTRAL characters believe the rule of law is more important than
  any objective good or evil outcome.

  NEUTRAL GOOD characters believe that the triumph of good is more important
  than the rule of either law or chaos.

  TRUE NEUTRAL characters believe that there must be a balance between good
  and evil and law and chaos.

  CHAOTIC GOOD characters believe in creating good outcomes unfettered by the
  rule of law.

  CHAOTIC NEUTRAL characters believe that the freedom to act is more
  important than any objective good or evil outcome.

            Note: Due to the nature of this adventure, no evil Player
                  Characters are permitted.


                            -={Other Attributes}=-

  Each character also has three other important values that change as the
  game goes on: Hit Points, Experience Points and Levels.

  HIT POINTS (HP) represent the amount of damage a character can take before
  he goes unconscious.  To calculate a character's maximum HP, the computer
  rolls the character's hit dice and adds any adjustments for level or
  constitution.  A character gains a HP bonus to each hit die if his
  constitution is over 14.  When a character takes enough damage that his HP
  reach 0, he is unconscious.  If the character's HP drop to anything from -1
  to -9, he will lose 1 HP per turn from bleeding until he is bandaged or
  dies.  A character is dead if he has -10 HP or less.  When you view a
  character, his HP on the screen will never be displayed as less than 0.

  EXPERIENCE POINTS are a measure of what the character has learned on his
  adventures.  Characters receive experience points for action such as
  fighting monsters, finding treasures and successfully completing quests.
  The computer keeps tract of experience and when characters earn enough they
  may advance in levels.  See the Level Advancement Tables for each class's
  experience requirements.

  LEVELS are a measure of how much a character has learned in his class.
  Characters can go to a hall and receive the training required to increase
  in level when they have enough experience.  Characters may only advance one
  level at a time.  If a character has gained enough experience to go up two
  or more levels since the last time he has trained, he will go up one level
  and lose all experience in excess of one point below the next level.

            Example:
            An 11th level thief enters a training hall with 667,543
            experience points (enough for 13th-level).  He will leave
            as a 12th-level thief with 660,000 experience points--
            one point below 13th level.  Once characters have reached
            their maximum levels for this game, they cannot train.

  New characters start with 210,003 experience points and they will already
  have all levels and spells appropriate for that experience.  Characters may
  advance to a maximum of 14th-level, except thieves who may advance to 18th-
  level.


                       -={Building a Successful Party}=-

  Forming a strong and adaptable party is a key to success in Champions of
  Krynn.  You may place up to six Player Characters on your party.  It is
  recommended that you use all six characters.  A smaller party is less
  powerful and more likely to be eliminated by your enemies.

  In choosing which characters to include in the party, it is wise to include
  a variety of classes: clerics, mages, thieves and fighters.  At least one
  party member should be a kender, so you may taunt (yell) in combat.  Some
  adventurers may only be completed if the part includes a Knight.

  Sample party .... type later....


                             -={Why These Guys?}=-

  CLERIC/FIGHTER/MAGES are ultimate multi-purpose character.  They can cast
  both mage and cleric spells while wielding the armor and weapons of a
  fighter.  The main disadvantage of the cleric/fighter/mage is that, as a
  triple-class character, he advances in levels quite slowly.

  FIGHTER/MAGES may cast spells while wearing armor.  This split class can
  fight as well as a fighter and receives more HP than a pure mage.

  CLERIC/THIEVES more HP and better armor class than pure thieves.  As a
  cleric, the cleric/thief can cast healing and support spells, allowing the
  character to perform double duty as both the party thief and addition
  healer.  The thief status permits the powerful back stab attack.

  CLERICS are essential for healing the party after engagements.  The most
  efficient way to heal is the Encamp and select FIX (you can issue this
  command several times while encamped).  FIX works as follows:

  If a cleric is in the party, all available cure spells are cast and
  automatically rememorized, until all characters are healed.  If the party
  has taken more damage than clerics have cure spells, the FIX option may be
  used again.  When FIX is used, characters at top of the list will be healed
  before the characters below them.  If a cleric is not in the party, HP may
  be recovered through rest (1 HP per 24 hour period), potions or Temple
  services.

  RANGERS normally start the game with more HP than other fighter types.
  They do extra damage versus giant type monsters and receive mage and
  druidic spells at high level.

  KNIGHTS are powerful fighters and there are some items that may only be
  used by them.  Knights have special leadership abilities and gain clerical
  spells at high levels.

  PALADINS are great warriors.  In addition to their martial prowess, they
  have natural protection from evil, healing powers and they gain clerical
  spells.


                            -={Preparation Tips}=-

  The makeup of your party affects your combat strategy throughout the game.
  Loading your party with clerics and mages increases the importance of spell
  casting both before and during a battle.  AN emphasis on fighters, Knights,
  paladins or rangers makes your hand-to-hand combat skills that much more
  important.

  Ready the melee weapons (swords, maces, quarter staffs) at the start of the
  game instead of the missile weapons (bows, slings, dart).  Be sure to keep
  arrows ready too.



  ================================[COMBAT]===================================

  Adventurers must battle their way through many dangerous foes to complete
  the mission.  Tales of bravery and heroes right with the sounds of combat.
  The following sections offer some more information and tips for combat.


                               -={Combat Map}=-

  Battle takes place on a tactical combat map that is more detailed view of
  the map terrain (3D or overland) that the party was on when the combat
  began.  This map is set up with an invisible square grid and you will
  notice that everything moves on the grid from square to square.  Moving
  diagonally often costs more movement points than moving horizontally or
  vertically.

                               -={Initiative}=-

  Each round of combat is divided into 10 segments.  Every character and foe
  acts on a specific segment based on a random number.  The random segment
  number is generated at the start of each combat round and is modified by
  dexterity and random factors such as surprise.  In most cases a character
  will move and/or aim an attack during his segment.  Casting spells may take
  extra segments to perform, so often a spell-caster will begin his spell on
  his segment and have it go off a few segments later.

  Sometimes a character will act in segment 10 of one round segment 1 in the
  next, appearing to act twice in a row.  This is especially common if you
  use the DELAY command.  When the DELAY command is giver, that character's
  action is always delayed until segment 10.


                            -={Computer Control}=-

  In Combat, the players controls the actions of PCs.  The computer controls
  the actions of monsters, NPCs and PCs set to computer control with the
  QUICK command.  If you have a Knight in your party, he may take control of
  NPCs at the start of combat by making a successful leadership check.  A
  successful leadership check puts NPCs under normal control for that combat.


                             -={Combat Ability}=-

  Each characters ability in combat is defined by his AC, THAC0 and damage.

  AC
  ==
  A character or monster's difficulty to be hit is represented by his armor
  class or AC.  The lower the AC, the harder it is to hit the target.  AC is
  based on armor and a dexterity bonus.  Some magic items also help a
  character's AC.

  THAC0
  =====
  The character's THAC0 represents his ability to hit enemies in melee or
  with missile fire.  THAC0 stands for TO Hit Armor Class 0.  This is the
  number a character must 'roll' equal or greater than to do damage on a
  target with an AC of 0.  The lower the THAC0, the better the chance to hit
  the target.

            Note: The generation of a random number is often referred
                  to as a 'roll'.  In determining if an attack hit, the
                  number generated is from 1 through 20.


  An attack is successful if the random number is greater than or equal to
  the attacker's THAC0 minus the target's AC.  THAC0 may be modified by
  range, attacking from the rear, magic weapons and magic spells among other
  things.

  DAMAGE
  ======
  When a hit is scored, the attacker does damage.  Damage is the range of HP
  loss the attacker inflicts when he hits an opponent in combat and it
  depends on the attacker's strength and weapon type.  The damage each weapon
  can do is summarized in the Weapon Table, refer to the tables.

  Some monsters take only partial or no damage from certain weapon types.
  Skeletons, e.g., take only half damage from sharp or edged weapons, while
  some other monsters only take damage from magical weapons.


                                -={Attacking}=-

  Characters generally engage in melee combat, which is face-to-face fighting
  with weapons such as swords and maces.  Characters also hove other options,
  such as ranged combat, with bows and slings, and rear attack on engaged
  foes.  Different options and restrictions apply to each.

  Ranged Weapons
  ==============
  A character with a missile weapon (bow, sling, etc.) may not attack when
  adjacent to na enemy.  The exception to this is the kender hoopak.  Kender
  may attack adjacent targets with the metal shod end of their hoopaks or use
  it as a ranged weapon.

  Bows can be used twice per turn.  3 darts can be thrown per turn.

  Multiple Attacks
  ================
  After seventh level (eighth for rangers,) all fighter-type characters
  increase the number of attacks they make with melee weapons.  The first
  increase is three attacks every two rounds, then two attacks every round.
  See the Bonus Attacks for High Level Fighters (refer to the tables).  All
  of a character's attacks are taken against his first target.  If the first
  target goes down with the first attack, he can aim the remaining attack at
  another target.  Fighter-types may also sweep through several weak
  opponents in one combat round.  When a character sweeps, he automatically
  attacks all of the weak opponents.

  Back Stabbing
  =============
  A thief back stabs if he attacks a target from exactly opposite the first
  character to attack the target.  The thief may not back stab if he has
  readied armor heavier than leather.  A back stab has a better chance of
  hitting the defender and does additional damage.


                            -={Combat Strategies}=-

  To succeed in combat, a skilled player deploys his party well, casts
  effective spells before and during combat, maneuvers his characters into
  advantageous positions and attacks using his most powerful characters and
  weapons.

  Deploying the Party
  ===================
  When a battle begins, your party is automatically positioned based on the
  order list of the characters. Characters near the top of the order will be
  in front lines and vulnerable to attack.  To change the starting
  deployment, change the order from the Alter menu while encamped.  Shift the
  heavily-armored fighters up the list and the vulnerable mages and thieves
  towards the bottom of the list.  Party order cannot be changed while in
  combat, although they are free to move.

  When battle begins, your party may be placed in a bad position.  If you
  wish to be defensive, move your characters to anchor your flanks on an
  obstacle such as a wall or tree.  Setting up behind a doorway that your
  enemies have to move through makes for a very strong defensive position.
  Also, keep mages safe behind the front line.

  -WOUNDED CHARACTERS-
  Characters who are seriously injured should be moved out of the front lines
  if possible.  Remember: if you move away from an adjacent enemy, he gets a
  free attack at your back.  Back attacks have an improved chance to hit.

  -STOPPING RANGED ATTACKS-
  Missile weapons cannot be fired if there is an adjacent opponent.  If you
  want to fire missiles, make sure you keep away from the enemy.  Hoopaks are
  the only exception, as they may be used either as a missile weapon or a
  melee weapon.  To stop enemy missile fire, move someone next to the
  opponent.

  -EXPLOITING ENEMIES' WEAKNESSES-
  Exploit your opponents' weaknesses by directing attacks against helpless,
  wounded or isolated foes.  Concentrate your attacks to eliminate one
  opponent rather than injure many (Exception: enemy spell casters).  A foe
  with one hit point remaining attacks as powerful as an uninjured one.

  Spell casters cannot fire spells after they have taken damage in a round
  and they will lose any spells they are in the process of casting when they
  are hit.  Try to keep enemy spell casters under attack every round while
  protecting your own.


                             -={Combat Movement}=-

  The number of squares a character can move is affected by the weight he's
  carrying, his strength and the kind of armor he has readied.  A character's
  movement range is displayed on the view screen and when moving during
  combat.

  -RUNNING AWAY-
  A character may flee from the battlefield if he can move faster than all
  enemies, but not if he moves slower than any enemies.  A character has a
  50% chance to move off the battlefield if he can move as fast as the
  fastest monster.  Exception: if a monster or character can reach the edge
  of the combat map without any of his opponents being able to see him, he
  may then flee successfully even though he is slower than his opponents.

  -RETURNING TO THE PARTY-
  A character that moves off the battlefield returns to the party after the
  fight is over.  If all active characters flee combat, any dead or
  unconscious characters are lost.  If a whole party flees, it will not
  receive any experience points for monsters killed before retreating.


                              -={After Combat}=-

  If one or more characters survive on the battlefield at the end of combat,
  the bodies of unconscious or dead party members stay with the party.  If
  the entire party flees from combat, all unconscious and dead party members
  are permanently lost.  If ALL the party members are slain, go back to your
  last Saved Game and try again from that point.



  =================================[MAGIC]===================================

  Magic is integral to DEATH KNIGHTS OF KRYNN.  Mages and clerics, as well as
  high-level Knights, rangers and paladins can cast spells.  A spell can
  exist in one of four forms: in a character's memory, in a character's spell
  book, in a scroll or in a wand.  A spell-caster with a memorized spell can
  cast it using the CAST command.  Spells are memorized during rest while
  encamped.

  Memorizing a spell takes 15 minutes of game time per spell level, plus a
  minimum period of preparation of four hours, plus two hours every two spell
  levels.  For example, first and second level spells take a minimum
  preparation of four hours, while third and fourth level spells take six
  hours.

            Example:
            To memorize (2) first-level spells, (1) second level
  spell and (1) third-level spell would take:
            (6 hours preparation) + (2*15min) + (1*30min) +
            (1*45min) = 7 hours 45 min.

  Spells do not automatically have their full effect on their target.  Each
  target of a spell may get a saving throw to avoid some or all of the effect
  of the spell.  As a character gains levels, his saving throws improve.

            Note: Some monsters have magic resistance which decreases
                  the chance of them being affected by spells.


                                  -={Mages}=-

  There are two orders of mages you can play--White Robes and Red Robes.  All
  good alignment mages are White Robes and all neutral alignment mages are
  Red Robes.  Evil mages are of the Black Robe order.  The few mages in the
  world who do not enter an order are called "Rogues," and are attacked on
  sight by all of the other orders.  Mages keep spell information in their
  personal spell books and may only memorize spell that are recorded there.

  When a mage trains for a new level, he selects a new spell to scribe into
  his spell book.  A mage can also scribe spells from identified scrolls if
  he is of high enough level to cast them and they are the correct type for
  his order.  Red Robe mages may only use or scribe Red Robe scrolls and
  White Robe mages may only use or scribe White Robe scrolls.  A mage must
  cast the Read Magic spell in order to identify the spells on the scroll.  A
  spell disappears after it has been scribed or cast.

  THE MOONS OF KRYNN
  ==================
  Since the creation of the world, three moons have governed the powers of
  magic in Krynn.  As the moons wax and wane, so do the powers of magic
  aligned to them.  Each moon has a different cycle and affects a different
  group of mages.  Mages of the White Robes gain their power from Solinari
  the white moon, Mages of the Red Robes are governed by Lunitari the red
  moon.  The evil Mages of the Black Robes are empowered by the dark moon
  Nuitari.  The current position of the moons is displayed at the top of your
  computer screen and their effects are as follows:

                      --------REFER TO MOON.GIF-------

  SPHERES OF MAGIC
  ================
  The magic of Krynn operates in spheres, with the different schools of mages
  only able to manipulate certain of them; spells castable by one order may
  not necessarily be cast by another.  The Spell Parameters Table and the Spell
  Descriptions section detail which mage orders can cast each spell.

               
                                 -={Clerics}=-

  Clerical magic requires no spell books.  All clerical spells of the
  appropriate level are always available to a cleric, the character need only
  memorize them.  Unlike mages, clerics can cast spells from scrolls without
  any preparation.

  DEITIES
  =======
  Since the earliest days of Krynn, the wisdom of the deities has been
  brought to all the races through the efforts of the clerics, the mortal
  messengers of the will of heavens.  As a sign of favor, deities bestow upon
  their clerics special bonuses or additional spells.  The following is a
  list of deities of Krynn that are available to characters, their alignment
  and clerical bonuses:

  GOOD ALIGNED DEITIES:

       Paladine
       Powers: None
       Extra Spells: Protection from evil 10' radius

       Majere
       Powers: Turn undead as if cleric is two levels higher
       Extra Spells: Silence 15' radius

       Kiri-Jolith
       Powers: +1 THAC0
       Extra Spells: Detect Magic

       Mishakal
       Powers: +1 die on all healing spells
       Extra Spells: Charm Person, Remove Curse, Bless

  NEUTRAL ALIGNED DEITIES

       Sirrion
       Powers: None
       Extra Spells: Burning Hands

       Reorx*
       Powers: +1 THAC0 (dwarves only)
       Extra Spells: None

       Shinare
       Powers: None
       Extra Spells: Charm Person

     * All dwarven clerics must select Reorx and therefore be neutral.


                          -={Knights and Paladins}=-

  Knights and paladins use their clerical spells identically to clerics,
  except that they can never use clerical scrolls, even if they may cast the
  spells.


                               -={Rangers}=-

  Rangers use mage and druidic spells.  They use mage spells identically to
  mages and the druidic spells as clerics use their magic.  Rangers can never
  cast spells from scrolls, even if they can memorize and cast the scroll
  spell normally.


                        -={Tips on Magic Spells}=-

  Both clerics and mages may cast spells which assist the party in combat.
  Preparatory spells cast just before a battle can protect and strengthen
  characters.  Spells can be cast to damage foes during combat or to protect
  or heal comrades.

  Spells should be rememorized as soon as possible after they are used.  This
  is most likely to happen after combat.  When in camp, have your spell-
  casters memorize spells and select REST to allow them to imprint the spells
  for later use.  Selecting REST without choosing new spells has the spell-
  casters rememorize the spells they have cast since last resting.

       Note: Before resting, it is a good idea to save your game. We
             recommend that you save your game after every tough
             combat and that you keep at least two separate saved
             games at all times and alternate between them.  This will
             allow you to go back to a save before that fatal
             battle.



  ===========================[MAGICAL TREASURES]=============================

  As you travel about and encounter the monsters and puzzles that stand
  between you and finishing your various quests, you will also find magical
  items to help you on your way.  Here are some descriptions of items that
  you may find.  Not all of these items may be found in your adventure.  You
  can find out if there is a magic item in a treasure by doing a Detect Magic
  spell using the DETECT command.  To find out specifically what an item is,
  you must take it to a shop and have it identified.

  Some Magic items are in reality cursed and can do great harm.  When a
  character readies a cursed item, a Remove Curse spell must be cast before
  the item can be dropped.  Some magic items may only be used by certain
  classes.  Others may not work at all if certain other magic items are also
  in use.  You must select the READY command from the Items Menu to prepare
  items for use.  Items such as armor, weapons or adornments are simply
  readied and you gain their benefit automatically.  Items like scrolls or
  potions must be readied before they can be used.


                                  -={Wands}=-

  Wands are the traditional objects of enchantment.  Wands generally will
  cast a set number of a given spell (Fireball or Ice Storm for instance).
  Only experimentation or paying to have them identified will tell what a
  wand does.  Generally wands can only be used by mages, although a few can
  be used by other classes.


                                 -={Potions}=-

  Potions are the most common sort of magical treasure.  Potions may head
  wounded characters, cause them to become hastened or invisible or cause any
  number of other effects.


                                 -={Scrolls}=-

  Scrolls can be either for clerics or one of the mage orders.  They offer
  new spells for mages to scribe into their books, spells of a higher level
  than the spell-casters can normally cast and extra spells for emergencies.
  A mage may use SCRIBE to transfer a scroll into his spell book.  Mages and
  clerics can cast spells directly from scrolls with USE command.


                       -={Enchanted Armor and Shields}=-

  Sometimes you may run across armor or shields that have been created by
  skilled craftsmen and then enchanted by mages to imbue them with protective
  spells.  The power of the magic on these items may vary a great deal.
  Enchanted armor has the great advantage of offering improved protection
  with less encumbrance than the same type of mundane armor.

                             -={Solamnic Plate}=-

  These suits of plate mail were originally crafted for some of the Knights
  of Solamnia.  The armor is of exceptionally high quality and is very
  ornate.  Only Knights may use Solamnic Plate.


                            -={Enchanted Weapons}=-

  Enchanted weapons come in many sizes and shapes and potencies.  Sometimes a
  weapon will ad to you THAC0 and damage.  Other weapons may have other
  magical properties including extra bonuses against specific types of
  creatures.  Once a magic weapon has been readied from the Items Menu, the
  character will have it for all combats.


                          -={Enchanted Adornments}=-

  Bracers, necklaces, periapts and especially rings are favorite objects for
  magical enchantment. These items may have any number of magical properties.
  Some items will help you AC, others may fire Magic Missiles or be cursed.
  Once one of these items has been readied from the Items Menu, a character
  will automatically gain all effects.  The exception to this rule is that
  certain magical necklaces require the USE command to work.


                             -={Dragonlances}=-

  These powerful enchanted weapons were created for the War of the Lance, to
  combat the evil dragons.  They have large bonuses against any foe, but are
  deadly when attacking dragons, where they do the wielder's hit points in
  damage to the beast.


                           -={Enchanted Clothing}=-

  Wizards will sometimes cast enchantments on commonplace items of clothing
  such as gauntlets or cloaks.  A wide variety of these items are know to
  exist.
