The story so far..

Shadow Of The Beast:

As a small child, Aarbron was enslaved by the Priests of te Beast Lord. He was tormented for years asubjected to an evil programme of will-sapping drugs. He eventually had no purpose of his own and oaly belonged to Maletoth, The Beast Lord.
He became the Beast Messenger, a creature possesing great strength and agility, and he soon forgot hhuman ancestry.
Time passed and Aarbron performed his duties well, he was a good slave. Then, one fateful day, he waassing time watching ritual sacrifices when the man shackled to the alter woke dim and distant memre. Perplexed, Aarbron moved closer and looked long and hard at the face of the man about to be slugteed...
The sacrificial knife plunged down and Aarbron remembered with horror that the man he now looked on  his father!
As he watched the life blood flow from his body to splash red on the cold floor of the temple, the mries of his short childhood and the truth of who he really was became clear to him.
He looked around him at the priests of the Beast Lord and felt hatred. He swore vengeance on Maletotnd his aid Zelek.
Running away from the temple, cold tears stinging his anguished face, Aarbron vowed to avenge the de of his father and make them pay for his own years of torment...
He knew he had a long and difficult battle ahead of him...

Shadow Of The Beast II:

Aarbron fought bravely and battled hard but failed to destroy either Zelek or Maletoth. However, he  destroyed many armies of Beast followers and was rewarded by having some of his humanity returned
The power of the Beast was diminished... but Maletoth remained a dark threat.
Aarbron drank from a pool of cool clear water. As the refeshing liquid passed his lips, the pool dared and grew cloudy. A dull light from its depths illuminated a vision that transfixed Aarbrons gaz:H saw a small ramshackle house, lonely and vunerable in the storm that raged around it. High on a cgg cliff overlooking the house stood Maletoth... commanding the storm.
Lifting his arms to the rolling sky he began to metamorphose into his beast form... a horrific wingeemon.
With a cry of triumph he lept off the cliff and glided efforlessly through the maelstrom to land witark grace on the roof of the little house.
Inside, a frightened mother moved to protect her baby as the clawed hand of Maletoth smashed its wayrough the flimsy roof and reached down.
A baby's cry, a mother's scream and Maletoth flew from the roof and into the darkness... the frighte child in his talons.
A faint whisper escaped from Aarbrons lips... 'Sister!'
He heard Maletoth speak to him above the storm:
'She is perfect to take your place by my side... on Kara-Moon'
His evil laughter mingled with the thunder as the menacing vision slowly dissapeared to be replaced a bright rind of ripples.
Was Aarbron to be haunted forever by Maletoth?
He knew he must journey to Kara-Moon and face unknown terrors in order to rescue his sister.

Shadow Of The Beast III:

Zelek was dead...
Aarbron collapsed to the ground and slept.
As he dreamed, an apparition appeared before him in the form of a wizened man. The man smiled.
"You have done well, Aarbron. Zelek was indeed a powerfull enemy, to defeat him took great courage astrength. The world is now a safer place, thanks to your valour. But your battle is not yet over. aeoth, although abated is still a power to be reckoned with. To be free of his curse forever he mut e estroyed.
I am Rekann. Once magician to the King, I maintained the balance between light and dark, good and ev
Sadly, I was lapse. I should have seen Maletoth's power growing and sensed his presence, but he was ver... very clever. I had no hope, his attack was swift. Before I could retaliate he had imprisone ein this Cage Of Constraint. But now, your defeat of Zelek has weakened Maletoth sufficiently to llw e to contact you. His dark hold on the world is loosening. We must strike while we can.
To banish Maletoth forever you must seek out these four items:
The Skull Of Louq-Garou, The Quintessence Of Being, Pendek's Mace and the Crystals Of Hodag. Only whyou have these four entities will you be strong enough to face Maletoth. Awake now, Aarbron. Awaket ace your greatest challenge yet... but fear not for i shall be with you to guide you along the wy.Awke Aarbron... your transport awaits."
Aarbron stirred. He lay quietly on the ground, contemplating his dream. He felt different, he felt g. Looking down he saw that his body had changed, he had regained his human form. Maletoth's curse a eft him, he was free!


           ----------------------------------------------------


From the distance, Aarbron heard the throbbing hum of aircraft engines. He watched, fascinated, as ald plane flew into view and landed close by.
Aarbron waited... Nothing happened.
He approached the now silent aircraft and, as he neared it, the door opened. Aarbron jumped back, bugain nothing happened.
He looked inside... no-one was aboard. He climbed in and the door slamed shut. The engine fired up athe plane took off.
Aarbron made himself comfortable. The plane was heading north,... towards Maletoth.
