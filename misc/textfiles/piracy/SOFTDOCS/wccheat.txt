                             Wing Commader Series
                                   Cheat


        There is code for the Wing Commander Series to become invinsable
and able to destroy any ship with two keys.
        I've read in the Wing Commander Stratagy Guide that the code could
destroy the players enjoyment of the game or possibly crash the system.  I
used it on our system and it worked.  Origin designed this code to test play
the game and left it there because they thought that if they took it off, It
would create bugs on the game.  There is also a mission select code that goes
with it.

        Origin-This will allow you to destroy any ship, including friendly 
                ships by pressing <ALT> <DEL>. First you must target the
                ship, then destroy it.  You can also destroy your own by
                pressing <ALT> <Z>.

       EXAMPLE: In Wing Commander 1 prompt, (Wing)-wc Origin
                In Wing Commander 1 Secret Missions 1, (Wing)-z1 Origin
                In Wing Commander 1 Secret Missions 2, (Wing)-sm2 Origin
                In Wing Commander 2 promt, (Wing2)-wc2 Origin
                In Wing Commander 2 Special Operations 1 (Wing2)-so1 Origin
                In Wing Commander 2 Special Operations 2 (Wing2)-so2 Origin

        NOTE-Everything in the code must be in lowercase except the "O" in
             Origin.  The "O" must be uppercased.

                To enter a mission,  you must have the series number, then
                the mission number.  If you wanted to load the 3rd mission
                in the 4th series you type s4 m3

                WC-wc Origin s4 m3
                SM-z1 Origin s5 m2
                SM2-sm2 Origin s1 m4
                WC2-wc2 Origin s4 m2
                SO1-so1 Origin s5 m1
                SO2-so2 Origin s1 m1

            l (lowercase L)-allows you to proceed directly to the launch
                            sequence
        NOTE-After finishing the mission, it will return you to Dos

            -k (dash and lowercase K)-makes you invunerable to damage from
                                      guns, missles, asteroids, and mines


        EXAMPLE-If you wanted to load the 3rd mission of the 6th series in 
                Wing Commander 2 and goto the launch sequence and easily 
                destroy the enemy while being invinsable, this is what you 
                would type:

           C:\WING2>wc2 Origin s6 mc l -k
