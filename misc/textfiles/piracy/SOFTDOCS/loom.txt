        *** Setting Prefernces ***

   When loaded, the program will select the best graphics mode for your
   machine. It will also check to see if you have a mourse driver or
   joystick installed or an ADLIB, CMS/Game Blaster or Sound Blaster
   sound board and will set up the game appropriately. If you wish to
   override these default settings, you may do so by adding the
   following letters (seperated by spaces) after typing loom when you
   start the game:

        a  - Adlib card or CMS/Soundblaster sounds
        g  - CMS/Gameblaster sounds
        ts - Tandy sounds
        i  - Normal sounds (internal speaker)
        m  - MCGA graphics mode
        v  - VGA graphics mode
        c  - CGA graphics mode
        e  - EGA graphics mode
        t  - Tandy 16-color graphics mode
        2d - Use 2 floppy drives

   For example, to start the game in CGA graphics mode with Adlib sounds,
   type:
     loom a c

   Note: The game will run in the default mode if you select a mode or
   input device that your machine cannot support. If you have an EGA or
   MCGA graphics card and are willing to trade fewer colors for faster
   response, you may want to try playing the game in CGA graphics mode.
          Within the game, if the scrolling is too slow (when the
   picture moves sideways), you can select instant repositioning of the
   screen by holding down the ALT key and pressing 'i'.


        *** Cursor Controls ***

   For keyboard cursor control, use either the arrow keys or the keypad.
   Numbers 1,3,7, and 9 move the cursor directly to the corners of the
   display; use the even numbered keys for finer control.

   You can use a mouse for cursor control if you have installed a
   compatible mouse driver. Both mouse buttons correspond to the ENTER
   key. If you have a joy-stick, its button(s) will also correspond to
   the ENTER key.

   If you have both a mouse and a joystick installed, you may select one
   as your controller by holding down the ALT key and pressing 'm' or
   'j' for joystick. You may also recalibrate your joystick if the
   cursor is drifting across the screen by centering the joystick and
   pressing ALT 'j'


        *** Keyboard Controls ***

   To spin drafts using the keyboard, you can use either of the
   following sets of keys:

     Q W E R T Y U I

   These keys represent he tonal positions of the distaff on the screen:

        *** Save/Load Instructions ***

   If you are playing from floppy disks (and not a hard drive), you will
   need a blank, formatted disk BEFORE you start to play. This disk will
   become your Save/Load disk. If you are playing Loom from a hard disk,
   your games will be saved in the directory with the game files.

   Press F5 when you want to save or load a game. If you are playing
   from floppy disks, you will be asked to insert your Save/Load game
   disk.

   Once the Save/Load screen is displayed, you can move the cursor and
   click on either SAVE, LOAD or PLAY. The SAVE/LOAD option will not be
   available during the opening sequence.

   TO SAVE:

   Click on the SAVE option. The current list of saved games will be
   displayed in slots along the left side of the screen. Select a slot
   by pointing the cursor to it and clicking. Now you will be able to
   type a new name for that slot or use the backspace key to change the
   existing name. Pressing ENTER will reactivate the cursor. Click the
   cursor on OK to save the game, or CANCEL if you have changed your
   mind and do not wish to save it.

   TO LOAD:

   Click on the LOAD option. The current list of saved game will be
   displayed in slots along the left side of the screen. Select a slot
   by pointing the cursor to it and clicking. Click the cursor on OK to
   load the game, or CANCEL if you have changed your mind and do not
   wish to load it.

   Note: Loading a previously saved game will cause you to lose the game
   you are currently playing.

   SAVE/LOAD is disabled during cut-scenes (whenever the cursor
   disappears from the screen).
