                                  Gunship                              
                     A combat helicopter simulation game  
                               By Microprose      
                                  (c)1987



     This new Microprose game is a lot of fun.  In it, you fly an AH-64A
     Apache combat helicopter in battle conditions ranging from guerilla
     warfare to US-USSR war in Europe. 

     You can use either the keyboard or the joystick, but the joystick is
     highly recommended.

     Weapons data:
        TADS        - (Target Acquisition and Designation System).  The TADS
                      gunsight is the small box that appears in the center
                      of the screen.  Once TADS in locked onto a target, it
                      tracks while you manuever the helicopter.  All weapons
                      are sighted and/or guided by TADS with the exception of
                      the FFAR's, which are unguided.
        SIDEWINDER  - A fire-and-forget missile used for air to air.  Good
                      only against enemy aircraft.  Range 18 kilometers.
        2.75" FFAR  - Unguided rocket.  Line up crosshairs in TADS box and
                      fire.  Good against 'soft' targets like infantry, AA
                      gun sites, and installations, but not on tanks or
                      bunkers. Range 1.8 kilometers.
        HellFire    - An anti-tank missile.  Works on bunkers too, but doesn't
                      work on 'soft' targets as described above.  As long
                      as you keep TADS locked onto the target, HellFire will
                      fly toward it.  Range 6 kilometers.
        30mm Cannon - Automatically aimed by TADS.  Will destroy anything
                      except bunkers.  Range 1.5 kilometers.

     
     Radio messages:
        Occasionally you will receive radio messages from your base.  Press
        change CRT (space-bar) to receive them.  As you approach your home 
        base you will be asked to provide a countersign to a given password.
        The passwords and countersigns are listed below:

        PASSWORD     COUNTERSIGN
        --------     -----------
         ACCENT       TRAMPOLINE
         BILLBOARD    KICKBACK
         CROMAGNON    MELODRAMA
         DAKOTA       ONSTAGE
         ELECTRA      VERTICAL
         FOOTHOLD     INSOLENT
         GRENADIER    NOCTURNE
         HEDGEHOG     LOCKSMITH
         IVORY        WILLOW
         KNOCKOUT     PUREBRED
         LOZENGE      ROMANTIC
         MAZURKA      YELLOW
         NEBULA       QUAKER
         OVATION      UPSTAGE  
         PENTHOUSE    SYMPHONY
         QUARTZ       ZEBRA



     There's lots more detail to the game, but that's for you to discover as
     you play.  Have fun!
