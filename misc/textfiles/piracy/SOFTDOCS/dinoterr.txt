Well, this is my first review for TeRRaTRoN.  Actually, it's my first review
ever.  Hopefully, you'll enjoy this review as much as I enjoyed putting it
together.  Enough with the formalities, on with the review...

DinoPark Tycoon is a game based on a zoo which exhibits only dinosaurs
(surprise, surprise!)  You are a zoo owner required to buy all the necessary
pieces to run your zoo.  Naturally, the object of the game is to turn a
profit and not go bankrupt.

The game starts with a bank loan of $5000 from which you need to buy land,
fencing, dinosaurs and food.  Employees, concessions and advertisements are
optional, but eventually they will be needed. 

To start you need to buy land.  The differnt types of land are desert, plains 
or marsh.  Each type of land supports only certain types of dinosaurs.  

Next, you'll need fencing to prevent the dinos from rampaging the city. 
The options of fences are wood, chain link and cement.  In addition,
electrical wiring can be added to any type of fence.  I haven't determined
exactly what the difference is but as you can guess, the more expensive the
fence, the better it should be.

Next you'll need some dinos to show the public.  There are 20 different types 
of dinosaurs to choose from.  Each has it's own specifications for quantity 
and type of food it consumes.  To find out this information, just click on 
the dinosaur and then on the "?".

Somebody must run the zoo so you'll need some employees.  Employees include 
maintenance, veterinarian, security, tour guide, concession and manager.  The 
only required employee is a security guard.  A tour guide will increase 
revenues and a maintenance worker will ensure the fences don't have holes
in them. 

You'll also need something to feed the dinos so get some food. Food comes in 
3 different flavours: Meats, plants and seeds.  The choice of food depends 
on your dinosaurs.  There are 3 different levels of each type: small, medium 
and large.

Finally, you'll need to set the price of admission and then you'll be ready 
to start.  Thats all you need to begin playing the game, but here's some of 
the other stuff you can get (if you have the money :)

Concessions:  There are food stands, restrooms (useful!), gift stores and
extra parking.

Advertisements:  Flyers, newspaper, radio, television.  The bigger the ad, 
the more people who'll show up.  (obvious huh?)

Make sure you check your profit-and-loss system often too see how you're 
doing.  There is also a small section about dinosaurs and their history.  
This will give you a chance to get to know the different types of dinosaurs.

After playing it for a short period, I would say it's a pretty good game.
It reminds me a lot of SimCity with it's time clock and point-and-click
interface.  Sound support is excellent, still missing GUS support though ):
There are digital sounds throughout the game.  For example, after you
choose a dinosaur, there's a neat hatching sound.  I thoroughly enjoyed these
sounds, but I can see them getting annoying after playing for a long period
of time.

The graphics are about average.  There is animation throughout the game,
and makes it interesting whenever you pause to think.  The speed is good,
even on my pathetic 386/20mhz.

In conclusion, I would recommend this small download.  If you enjoyed
SimCity and like dinosaurs, I'm sure you'll have hours of fun.  Well, I'm 
off to play some more.  Maybe, the dinosaurs won't get out this time.
