-*FULL DOCS FOR SENSIBLE SOCCER!*-

Typed by MUNCHIE AND LOL! 11.6.92


INTRODUCTION.

Sensible Soccer is a soccer game, in fact here in England it is what 
we call a football game or dare I say a football simulation. The main 
part of the game is the football action itself, the rules of which I 
shall describe breifly below. Around the football action we have 
included a fair variety of different football competitions Cups, 
Leagues and Championships, both real and imaginary, with 64 top 
European football clubs and all 34 European national teams including 
1250 different players. All these features shold add to your enjoyment
of what we consider to be the most realistic and playable football 
simulation to date.


LAYMANS RULES OF FOOTBALL.

Here then for the uninitiated are a very basic set of rules for the 
game of football.

1. There are 2 sides of 11 players each.

2. One player on each side is called Goalkeeper and goalkeepers 
generaly stand in front of the goals at either end of the pitch 
wearing dark green jerseys. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed 
to touch the ball with their hands, so watch out.

3. Each team is given a direction to kick in and the object of the 
game is to kick the ball into the goal or net that you're opponents 
goalkeeper is defending. If you manage to do this then youre team has 
scored a goal.

4. After 45 minutes the goalkeepers swap ends and the teams kick the 
other way up the pitch. The interval between the 2 halves is called 
Half Time. 

5. After 90 minutes and the team that has scored the most goals wins, 
Hurraaah! If both teams have scored the same ammount of goals after 90
minutes then it is called a Draw.

6. If it is a draw after 90 mins and extra time is being played, then 
the teams will continue to play for another 30 mins with aditional 
half swap in the middle. If one of the teams has scored more goals 
than the other after extra time then they are the winners. But... 

7. ... If the game is to be decided on penalties and the game is still
a draw after extra time or, if it is a draw after 90 mins and no extra
time is permitted the the winner of the game is decided on the basis 
of a penaly shoot-out.

8. A Penaly Shoot Out is a sequence of penalty kicks. A penaly kick is
where the ball is placed on the penalty spot (The spot in the middle 
of the big box near the goal net) and the player from one team has to 
try and kick the ball past the opposing goalkeeper and into the net. 
In a Penalty Shoot Out the teams take it in turns to take penalty 
kicks against each other until each team has taken 5 penalty kicks. 
The team that has scored the most goals from the penalty kicks wins. 
If both teams have scored an equal number of goals from their first 
five penalty kicks then a situation arises known as Sudden Death. 
During Sudden Death each team takes one penalty kick each and if 
necessary another penalty kick each until during such a brace of 
penalty kicks one team scores and the other team doesn't. In this case
the scoring team is the winner.

9. A match starts with either team kicking off from the centre spot 
(The spot in the middle of the pitch) both teams then continue to boot
the ball around until one of five thing happen. Either: i.The ball 
goes over the touch line to the side of the pitch for a throw in. In 
which case a member of the team that wasn't the last to touch the ball
will pick it up and throw it back onto the pitch from the point on the
touch line where the ball left the field fo play. The players can then
continue to kick the ball around. ii.The ball goes over the touch line
behind one of the goals. if the last person to touch the ball was the 
goal keeper defending that goal or any other member of his team then 
this results in a corner kick to be taken by the other side. For a 
corner kick the ball is placed in the quarter circle in the corner of 
the field of play nearest the point where the ball crossed the touch 
line. The ball is the kicked back into play by a member of the other 
side before the booting around can start again. iii.The ball goes over
the touch line behind one of the goals having been touched by the 
atacking that goal as opposed to the team including the goalkeeper who
are defending that goal. This results in a goal kick, to the defending
team, which means a member of the defending team (usually the 
goalkeeper) will place the ball in the forward corner of the 6 yard 
area (the little box near the goal net), nearest the point where the 
ball crossed the touch line, and wellie the ball back into play. iv.A 
member of the other team accidentally kick a member of the other team 
instead of the ball. This is called a foul. If a foul is commited then
the game is stopped and the team whose player got kicked is awarded a 
free kick. This means that the ball is placed on at the point on the 
pitch where the foul occured and the hobbling player or one of his 
team mates restarts play by kicking the ball. However if the foul is 
committed inside one of the penalty boxes (the big boxes next to the 
goal nets) and the player who got kicked is not on the same side as 
the goal keeper defending the goal, then the hobbling player and his 
team are awarded a penalty kick (see rule 8) not to be confused with a
penaly shoot out. After the penalty kick has been taken the play 
continues as normal. v.One of the teams scores a goal. If this happens
the ball is placed on the centre spot in the middle of the pitch and 
play restarts with the team who didn't score the goal kicking the 
ball.

10. At any of the points in the game descibed in rule 9 above it is 
possible for either team to swap one of their players on the field of 
play with one of their players on the bench. This is called 
substitution. Each team can make up to 2 substitutions in any one 
game.

11. There is no offside, Not in this game.

GAME CONTROLS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the game you may only control one member of your team at any 
one time. The man currently under your control is the one with the 
white number above his head. Control will be changed to another man if
the man currently under your control is too fat away from the ball or 
iff he has lost his footing for any reason

OFF THE BALL CONTROLS

These controls apply when the man under your control is not in 
possession of the ball.

Running.
To direct your man simply push your joystick in the direction in which
you want him to run. A running man can intercept the ball from an 
opponent in possession.

Sliding Tackles.
When running off the ball it is possible to slide into the ball or an 
opponent by pressing the fire button. This will make your player slide
in the direction which he is facing. Whilst the man is sliding it is 
possible to get him to deflect the ball in a direction different to 
the one in which he is sliding when he makes contact with it. To do 
this the joystick must be redirected whilst the man is in mid-slide 
before he has made contact with the ball. This is a skill which has to
be mastered.

Headers.
When the ball is in the air and you press the fire button, instead of 
sliding into the ball the man under your control will attempt to head 
the ball. Such headers can also be deflected in a similar way to 
sliding tackles but redirecting must take place before contact with 
the ball has been made.


ON THE BALL CONTROLS

These controls apply only when your man is direct possesion of the 
ball.

Dribbling
When on the ball simply push the ball in the direction you want the 
player to dribble the ball. You will find that as the player gathers 
speed it is harder for him to change direction and retain control of 
the ball. This is another skill that has to be mastered.

Pass.
When on the ball if you quickly tap the fire button whilst you are 
directing the joystick, the ball will be played along the ground in 
the direction you are facing or, if there is one of your team mates 
standing roughly in the direction you are facing and within apssing 
distance then the ball will be played to your team mates feet.

Kick.
To kick the ball in the normal way the joystick should be directed in 
the desired direction and fire button firmly pressed.

Lift and Bend.
When the ball has been kicked as opposed to being passed it is 
possible to apply varying degrees of lift and bend to it. To do this 
the joystick must be redirected within a very short time after the 
fire button is initially pressed. It is not necessary to release the 
fire button before redirecting.

Redirection Table For Lift and Bend.
Assuming the player is running and kicking up the pitch, lift and bend
when applied to a shot will work in the following manner:

UP                     A normal straight kick.
UP/RIGHT               A normal kick bending to the right.
RIGHT                  Lobbed kick bending to the right.
DOWN/RIGHT             An up and under bending to the right.
DOWN                   Straight up and under.
DOWN/LEFT              An up and under bending to the left.
LEFT                   A lobbed kick bending to the left.
UP/LEFT                A normal kick bending to the left.
CENTRED JOYSTICK       A straight lobbed kick.

The quicker the baend is applied to a shot the more exaggerated the 
bend will be.

Set Peices.
All set peice kicks and throws work as a normal kick or pass except 
that illegal or illogical angle cannot be chosen by the kicker or 
thrower.

Goal Keepers.
Goal keepers are always under computer control except when they have 
the ball in their hands or when they are about to take a goal kick, In
which case all they can do is kick the ball out.

The Bench.
The bench can be called on at any time during the game when the ball 
is out of play or if a free kick has been awarded, or before the 
begining of a half. To access the bench the joystick should be flicked
in any direction and left to return to the central position three 
times in quick succession. Alternatively the UP/DOWN arrow keys on the
keyboard can be used. This can only be done when the ball is out of 
play or before a free kick or at the begining of a half.

Manager.
Moving the arrow up and down the bench enables the selection of the 
manager or substitutes, press fire to select. The manage is the one 
wearing the brown coat and is used to change the team formation on the
pitch. When he is selected, press the UP/DOWN arrows to select the new
formation from the managers menu and then press fire.

Substitutes.
All the other players on the bench are the substitutes and upto 2 
substitutes can be brought on to replace other players in their team 
at anytime during a match. When a substitute is selected he will stand
up and the substitute menu will appear which will enable the player to
choose which player he wishes to take off. When the player to be 
brought off is selected he will run off the pitch and the selected 
substitute will run on. To exit from the bench or the 
Manager/Substitutes menus, Move the joystick left or right.

Key Controls During The Game.

UP ARROW            Bring on bench for team kicking up.
DOWN ARROW          Bring on bench for team kicking down.
P                   Pause on/off
R                   Replay last few seconds of action.
R                   Slow down replay whilst replay is being viewed.
SPACE               Record last few seconds of action to be played 
                    back as highlights.
F10                 Toggle crowd chants on/off.
ESCAPE              Abandon current game.
H                   Replay all game highlights in sequence (only when 
                    full time score is displayed)

NOTE: If there are too many highlights for any one game then the 
earlier highlights will be dropped.

THE MENUS

The menus are divided up into eight catergories, Options, Edit Teams, 
Load/save Data, Highlights, Friendly, Cup, Leaque, and Specials.

OPTIONS

Game Length:      The real time length of each match can be set to    
                  either 3, 5, 7, 10 minutes.

Auto Replays:     The automatic replaying of all goals can be toggled
                  On/Off

Menu Music        The music played during the menu sections of the 
                  game can be togged On/Off.

Auto Save/
Highlights        The automatic recording of all goals scored as
                  match highlights.

Seasonal Weather  There are two forms of pitch type selection in this
                  game, one known as pitch type is a striaght choice
                  of a icy,wet,soft,muddy,normal,dry or hard pitch or
                  a random choice between these seven. The other, 
                  known as seasonal weather, is mainly a means of 
                  simulating the influence that the weather can have
                  on a football match, league or cup. Each month of
                  the year has been given a specific, typical weather
                  pattern so a friendly played in July, for example,
                  has little chance of offering a muddy pitch and a
                  much greater chance of offering a nice dry one. For
                  Cups and Leagues the month selected will act as the
                  start of the season. Each League is played over an
                  eight month period with the matches spread evenly
                  over all eight months. Each round of a cup lasts
                  for one month so a three leg cup starting in July
                  will have its final played in September. Both legs
                  of a two leg round will be played in the same month
         
EDIT TEAMS.

The Edit Teams option allows you to change or update all data 
relating to any of the teams in the game. First the team to be edited
must be selected. Then the joystick or arrow keys are used to edit 
the team data. All text files for the player, team or manager names
are selectable with the fire/return button and can be edited using
the back arrow to delete and the normal letter keys to write. Press
return to finalise the new name.
the three face types are cycled through with the fire button.
to edit the kit colours select either shorts, shirt or socks and then
with the fire button depressed,direct the joystick up,down,left or 
right to cycle through the available colours. For two coloured shirts
left and right will change the main shirt colour and up and down will
change the secondary colour.
To select a new shirt type first select the shirt on the kit you wish
to edit and then move sideways to the small shirts in between the
first and second kits, then move up and down as appropriate and press
fire to select the new shirt type.
The team can be run by either a manager or a coach. Press the fire
button to edit.
G,D,M,F shows whether a player is a goalkeeper, defender, midfielder
or forward(this information cannot be edited).
A star beside a name denotes a star player(cannot be edited).
Player numbers cannot be edited.


LOAD/SAVE DATA

There are five different sets of data that can be loaded into the 
game, three of which can be constantly edited, saved back onto the
game disc and reloaded.

i.   Original National Teams
ii.  Original Club Teams
iii. National Teams And Data
iv.  Club Teams And Data
v.   Custom Teams And Data

Original national/club files can be edited but cannot be saved over

National/club teams and data are intended to be used by the player
as a form of updating the original squads provided. These can be 
edited, saved and reloaded time and time again(if original files are 
loaded and saved they will always overwrite these files not the 
original ones).
Custom teams and data are intended for the player to invent or 
recreate his/hers own teams and can also be edited, saved and reloaded
time and time again.
It should also be noted that whenever save is used it will save the 
setup of all teams currently loaded plus all team tactics and the 
latest league and cup tables. This data may only be saved directly 
onto game disc two.

HIGHLIGHTS.

This option is useful for the saving and loading of match highlights 
to and from a normal DOS disc. The file name is already allocated by 
the computor, so saving is simply a matter of inserting a disc, and 
loading is simply a matter of choosing the correct match name from 
upto four files on any one disc. Disks should be inserted only when 
instructions to to so are given.
There is also a facility to view highlights which will show the 
highlights just loaded or else the highlights of the last game played.
Highlights may only be saved onto a normal preformatted DOS disk.

FRIENDLY.

This a single match between either 2 players or the player and the 
computer (there is also a chance to watch computer versus computer). 
The desired pitch conditions or season should first be selected by 
cycling through the options with the fire button.
Then player teams must be chosen using the blue choose option. Two 
teams must be highlighted from the team list either as red computer 
teams or as blue player teams. The right number of teams must be 
chosen before the game can continue, confirm by selecting OK. When the
teams are chosen, select Play Match (see also pre-match tactics 
below). After each friendly there is an option to play the same game 
again or return to the main menu.

CUP.

The cup competition is basicly a knock-out competition for 2-64 
different teams at any one time, where during a series of games the 
winning teams remain in the competition and teams that lose are 
eliminated immediately, until in the end there are only 2 teams left 
to play out the last match of the cup in the cup final. The winner of 
the cup final gets the cup and the glory. There are options to select 
the pitch type/weather, the number of teams/rounds and the inclusion 
of extra time and/or penalties at various stages of the competition. 
If a match is drawn after 90 mins then extra time will be played if 
the option has been selected as yes for that round. Extra time will 
also be played if replay has been selected and the game is a replay. 
If no is selected then no extra time will be played. The possibility 
of penalties is dealt with in an identical way to extra time but if 
both are possibilities then extra time will always occur before 
penalties. If 2 leg matches are to played at any stage of the 
competition then the round will be decided over the course of 2 
matches with both teams taking it in turn to play at home. The scores 
of both matches are added up to give the final aggregate score and the
winner is the team with the highest total over the 2 matches. If the 
total over the 2 matches is a draw and the away goals rule has been 
set to yes, then the team which scored the most goals in the away leg 
will be the winner. If after taking this into consideration the result
is still a draw the extra and/or a penalty shoot out will be played as
appropriate, staright after 90 mins of the second leg. In either 2 or 
1 leg matches where the match has ended in a draw and there is no 
extra time or penalties, or where the match is still a draw after 
extra time and there are no penalties, then the teams will replay the 
match, (one leg only) in order to determine a winner. 

CUP MENU.

All options on the cup menu are selectable by using the fire button to
cycle through the avaliable choices. The teams for the cup competition
must then be chosen using the blue choose option in a similar way to 
selecting teams for a friendly. Upto 64 teams can be selected at once 
and all 64 teams can be player tems if so desired. When you are happy 
with all the options select play cup to start the competition. When 
into the cup sequence proper keep on selecting play match followed by 
next match to play the next match in sequence.
Computer results will be calculated where appropriate and played in 
sequence with matches involving either 1 or 2 players. All player 
matches will lead onto the pre match tactics screen.
To scroll through the draw/results of a round use the red arrows at 
the side of the table. To save a cup competition half way through 
select save data. This will also save the setup of all teams currently
loaded plus the current league setup. A cup can be exited and returned
to at any time provided that another cup has not been initiated either
via the cup or specials options.

LEAGUE.

The league is wgere 2-20 teams play matches against each other in 
sequence until they have all played each other between 1 and 10 times 
as specified. The results are tabulated using the following criteria: 
2 or 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss.
The team with the greatest number of points after all matches have 
been played wins the league.
Number of teams, Number of times to play each team, Points for a win 
and Start of season/Pitch type can all be set by simply cycling 
through the avaliabl options in the league menu and using the fire 
button to select the one you want.
Choose league teams using the Choose League Teams box in the same 
manner used for Friendlies and Cups above before selecting Play 
League.
Once in the sequence of games select Play Match and Next Match as in 
the cup option above.
Results are tabulated game by game.
Select Save Data to save league games at any stage together with all 
current teams and all current Cup Data.
A league can be exited and returned to at ant time provided that 
another league has not been initiated either via the League or the 
Specials option.

SPECIALS.

To help players get going quickly in cup and League competitions 
Specials offer various preset Cup and League competitions for the 
various sets of data plus the European Championships which is really 
an Extra Special.
The specials available depends on the current data that has been 
loaded.

When Club teams are loaded the choices are:

Cup Winners Cup and European Cup both of which have 32 teams, a 
one-leg final and 2 legs including the away goals rule for all other 
rounds.

UEFA Cup which has 64 teams with 2 legs plus the away goals rule for 
all rounds including the final.

European Superleague where 20 teams play each other twice scoring 2 
points for a win.

When National teams are loaded the choices are:

Euro Cup with 32 teams and no 2 leg matches.

League of Nations where 16 teams play each other once scoring two 
points for a win.

European Championship where 8 teams are divided into 2 sub leagues of 
4 teams each. Each team plays every other team within the sub league 
once in the first phase of competition. After all matches within the 
sub-league are played, the bottom 2 teams of each league are 
eliminated and the winners of each league play the second placed team 
in the other leaguein the semi-finals. The winners of the semi-finals 
then go on to play the final.

When Custon teams are loaded the choices are:

The Egg Cup with 64 teams and single leg matches except for the 
two-leg semi-finals and final.

The Chicken League with 2 teams playing each other 5 times scoring 3 
points for a win.

There is no limit to how many of the teams in all these specials can 
be selected as player teams but the player(s) should select at least 
one team as a player team if he/she wishes to play in the relevant 
competition.

PRE-MATCH TACTICS.

Before each match every player team is given the option to re-arange 
the tactical layout of his/her team. The formation can be changed by 
selected by the appropriate grey box. There is a choice between 8 
formations:4-4-2,5-4-1,4-5-1,5-3-2,3-5-2,4-3-3,All Out Attack,All Out 
Defence. Sustitutes are highlighted in the player list. To change 
players around on the field or to swap a substitute with someone in 
the starting lineup, select the name of the player to be moved from 
the list of names down the lefthand side of the screen and then pick 
his new position within the formation. The renumbering of swapped 
players is automatic. The likely formation of the opposition team for 
the current match can be seen if View Oppo is selected (press the fire
button to exit). Once the player is happy with the team selection Play
Game should be selected using the joystick with which he/she wishes to
play the game itself.
For a 2 player game both players will be allowed to edit their own 
team formation in turn before play commences. And then BINGO BONGO let
the fun begin!!
