    Thank you for uploading this file from the Ninth Plane, the best
    interactive BBS in school!

    In this cheat, I'm going to list all the NC Codes for everyone in case
    you've missed someone. Afterwards, I'll give you some minor hints.
    Note: Took me only two days to finish!

         Observations

    1. Hit List:   Harry Rice, Lola Lovetoy, Tex Murphy
    2. To close alarm in Law and Order's place, find key to the
       closet and move and look at the shelf.
    3. Black passcard in Air Bus station.
    4. Don't use auto-pilot for landings.
    5. Greg Call's Lab has the long pole necessary to reach the box
       help captive by the ape in Cal Davis's Lab.
    6. To get Ron Morgan's red passcard, feed the Pararna fish first!
    7. To get Greg Call's passcard, need to find some gloves and move
       the poisonous vine housing a secret compartment.
    8. Need Oil from Carl Linsky's lab to open the cabinet in Greg Call's Lab,
       which is imperative to shutting off the alarm.
    9. Move the Rat Cages in Carl Linsky's to disable the alarm.
   10. Get Power Drill in for the ending. After you arrive at the MTC Lab.,
       you will be knocked out by 2 thugs. Later, you will be imprisoned in
       a boiler room of Alcatraz. First, walk south and LOOK at the box. There
       should be a key there. Next, Walk all the way across the other room to
       some monitor. OPen the Panel and you should find a gas mask. Next, walk
       down a little south to some control panel. Use the switch onthe panel
       to open up the furnace and start the sprinkler system. Right after you
       turn on the switch, make a dash for the door. A robot will enter the
       room temporarily to put out the fire. I know, I know, it takes a lot
       of practice, but you'll get there.

       The rest is simple enough. Oh Yeah! If you finish the end, and your
       computer crashes, it might be a faulty Finale.acc file. Incidently,
       all .acc extensions is really zipped files, so you can use Pkunzip
       to view it. This is what I did. I unzipped the faulty Finale.acc file
       into another directory. Pkunzip told me that satb.mld failed the CRR
       check, and the file Texsave.mld had only 0 bytes. So I copied one of
       the other .mld files and renamed it texsave.mld. That way, you get
       to see the ending and the hot chick Sylvia. Notice that at the end,
       them talking has many INTREPRETATIONS!!!!

                        Thanks again,
                        Oh Yeah, Whoever has the registered version of
                        SCR2Gif.zip, please upload it to the Ninth Plane.
