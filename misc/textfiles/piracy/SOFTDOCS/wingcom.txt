a few tidbits

To land, center your home ship (the Tiger's Claw) and press T to target it,
then press C for communications, you will be presented with 2 things to say,
press 2 to contact the Claw, and then 1 to request clearance to land, then
go to the front of the ship and the rest is automatic.

During a flight the wingman may try to inform you of something, you must press
C and you will be given an option of things to say, press a number by what you
want broadcast to your wingman.

D cycles through all internal damage to your ship, damaged areas appear red.
G changes your ship's active gun, the selected gun is highlighted in green.
W Changes your ship's active missle, the selected missle is also in green.

Targeting Display (Right Video screen) shows the outline/current damage/ and
weapons of your current targeted ship using 3 colors
GREEN  = Undamaged, shields full
YELLOW = Light damage/shield damage
RED    = Weapon positions, shield damage, ship damage (red weapons are not
         damaged)

To target a ship, position it centered on the screen and press "T", if you want
to maintain lock even when it is not in view press "L"

Contacts are as follows
WHITE     = your home ship (Tiger's Claw)
DARK GREY = Terran Capital ships (your buddies)
ORANGE    = Kilrathi Capital ships (your enemys)
BLUE      = Terran Fighers (more buddies)
RED       = Kilrathi Fighters (more enemies)
YELLOW    = Missles targeted on you
The Flashing dot is you

Press C and a list of people you can talk to appears, press the number next to
the name of the pilot you want to talk to. a list of messages will appear.

Armor and Shield indicators will shrink when hit, when destroyed they will
vanish and warning lights will flash.

Blaster indicator shows the power level of your active guns, power is restored
over a period of time.

When the eject warning light comes on you had better eject quick!

You have a choice of missles

Dumb-fire         : Point it and shoot, it has no homing capability
Heat-Seeking      : Locks onto any heat source, foe or friendly!
Image Recognition : You must keep the target in view for a few seconds while
                    the missle memorizes the ship type you are attacking
Friend or Foe missle : Lock onto the nearest enemy ship, it is a smart missle
                       and identifies enemy ships due to the different signals
                       they broadcast, however if a friendly ship's Comm is
                       damaged, it may home in on them.
Laser Cannon       : Lasers don't do a lot of damage, but they are reliable and
                     will kill many enemy ships.
Mass Driver Cannon : Medium range/ medium damage, a good weapon.
Neutron Guns       : These do heavy damage, but they are close range only, they
                     also overheat and use a lot of power.
Porcupine Mines    : These have a limited homing capability but only have to
                     get close to explode, if you are being tailed, just drop
                     one and he either gets out of the way or is blown up.

All capital ships have turrented guns and will shoot a lot of flak, only the
most maneuverable ship can make it past them.

This game will use Expanded memory if you have some, the game will play if you
have none, but some options are not implemented without it, the game can play
a bit slower as well.

You need a minimum of 535k free and about 500k of Expanded memory for full
gameplay, the Expanded memory is used mainly to speed-load images while play-
ing. QEMM is listed as a great Expanded Memory Manager.

Radar Display :
Outer ring : space behind you
Inner ring : space in front of you
remember, this is now three-dimentional, you can go up/down left/right. the
big white + in space is where your waypoint is, steer toward it.

And last but not least, some hints.

The name of the game is to follow your wingman (or he follows you) if you two
separate you will both be in trouble, even when the enemy is in sight you
should finish your main objective (in that area) before you attack them, this
of course will not work if THEY attack you! Each enemy is different and has
different tactics.

one quick item, you will be called to protect a transport ship or Tiger's Claw
(your base ship) do not engage oncoming ships until they are within 5000 meters
from the ship you are protecting, not 5000 meters from YOU!

Hope this gets you started, there was a book that explained the details,
history etc..
