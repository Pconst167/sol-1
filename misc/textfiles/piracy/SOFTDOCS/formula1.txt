You've watched the Formula One rand Prix season on television. You've 
followed the championship battle and the duel between the worlds top two
dozen drivers. You've read the sports reports, the features in the glossies
and gaped at glamourous lifestyle pictures in gossip magazines. But you've
never known what it's like to strap yourself into that sleek cockpit,
don the brightly coloured helmet and wait on the starting grid for the 
green light to propel you into a full sixteen race grand prix season.
Now you can take the wheel for the ultimate challenge to you driving skills.
        
                                                        
MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix leaves nothing to the imagination. The
legendary Geoff Crammond, or "revs" and "Stunt Car Racer" fame, has 
designed the simulation that puts you right in the driver's seat. 
However, the simulation is not just about races, it's an attempt to 
show the complex decisions that have to be made by teams when setting up 
a car to race on a particular circuit. Can your car take more wing? Should
you re-adjust the gear ratios?
                                                                
What about the Rookie driver who has never actually driven a car? We have
included a Quickstart Learner's first lesson that guides the Rookie 
through several laps of the famous Monza circuit.                
                                                                
Unlike most racing games MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix is packed full
of detailed scenery from the original 16 circuits. If you have time you
can admire the yacht in the harbour at Monaco or the Dome at Mexico City.
                                                        
MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix gives you the complete racing driver
experience from stormy start to fiery finish.                
                                                                
                                                               
                            OVERVIEW                            
                            --------
                                                               
MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix us a complete simulation of the full
championship season. At the end of the 16 races there are two trophies
to be won: the Driver's and the Contructor's championship.       
                                                               
It is always to tough to win even one Grand Prix race and, at the highest
level we think youll ind it very difficult. However, for the less 
experienced drivers we have included 5 levels of difficulty with 6 
major driving aids that, when fully implemented, will leave you free to 
race the car on a previously defined ideal line. You can even choose to 
redistribute the driving performance of all other drivers.       
                                                               
You can even win the Championship at the lowest level but it will only be 
at the highest level of difficulty that you receive the ultimate accolade.
                                                               
THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE SIMULATION ARE:                     
                                                               
QuickStart Driving Tutorial

A drive through of the Monza circuit for Rookies. The best way to get to 
grips with the F1 car and to get to know the circuit.              
                                                                      
Cockpit and Car Controls

Understand and learn all cockpit controls unt8l everything becomes second
nature to you. Get used to looking in both mirrors and being aware of what
is going on behind you.                                   
                                                               
Car Set-up
--- ------                                                        
                                                                      
You must find out how your car behaves on each circuit with various setups
for wings, tyres, brakes and gears. Don't be afraid to experiment! As you
improve and hone your driving skills, you will appreciate the value of
things such as the correct wing downforce.                            
                                                               
Driving into the Pits.                                   
------- ---- --- ----                                                 
                                                                      
It's essential to know where your pits are on every circuit and be able to 
get in and out safely and quickly.                            
                                                               
Practice any Circuit.                                   
-------- --- --------                                                 
                                                               
Use these sessions to practise setups, driving styles and get to know all 
the circuits. You are alone on the circuit and there is no pressure to get
a fast time. Get an impression of what should be a good lap time on every
circuit.

Acqaint yourself with the way the other cars are performing and what 
tactics they use for overtaking. This practise is used for setting up 
your car before qualifying practise, and you will get an idea of what a
circuit is like with other cars roaring around it.

Try to achieve a good grid placing. There will be more pressure on you at
this point. Understand the limited life of qualifying tyres.

This manual will refer to the Accelarator, the Brake, Changing Gear and
Steering.  You will be able to control these functions by keyboard and
joystick. Key 'K' toggles keyboard and joystick mode. The simulation is
initially in joystick mode; the recommended method.              
                                                        
The joystick movements are :
       
              Joystick Up    = Accelarate.
              Joystick Down  = Brake.
              Joystick Left  = Turn Left.
              Joystick Right = Turn Right.
              Fire Button    = Select.
                     
              Accelarate + Select = Change gear up.
              Select while not accelarating = Change Gear Down.
                                                               
If you are using keyboard then the equivalent keys to the joystick 
movements are :-
                                                               
       A and Z = Accelarate / Brake.
       < and > = Left and Right.
       Space   = Select.
       
The simulation does not support mouse control except during menu selection.
The keyboard cursor keys can also be used to highlight menu options.
                                                 
                                                                        
ONE LAP OF MONZA FOR ROOKIES.
=============================
       
Loading - Install and/or load the simulation and follow any on screen 
          prompts until you see the MAIN MENU.
       
Choose RACE SET-UP OPTIONS. Find RACE DISTANCE and reduce the figure to 
10%. Find LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY and select ROOKIE. Return to MAIN MENU.
                                                               
Highlight the DRIVER SELECT menu.                            
                                                                      
Select a driver and, if you wish, you may delete the name using the 
backspace key and type in your own name. Then select 'Driver Selection 
Complete'.                                   
                                                               
Highlight 'Practise any Circuit' with you controller and press the 
selector.                                                               
                                                 
Highlight the CIRCUIT SELECT MENU.                                   
                                                               
Select MONZA. You will see a view of the circuit. Choose INFO. This gives 
you the lap records and distance. Select OK.              
                                                               
You will now find yourself in the pits an MONZA, Italy.              
                                                               
Look at the cockpit controls. Accelarate with the controller and listen to
the engine noise.                                                 
                                                               
Press the function keys F1,F2,F3,F4,F5 and check that each function key
has illuminated 5 of the 6 symbols that appear on the dashboard panel. 
Each key turns on a driving aid to help you control the car. Do not press
function key F6.                                   
                                                               
You will not need to worry about changing gear or braking. You may crash 
if you stray from the racing line but you will not be damaged by any 
"shunt". If you spin off, the car will right itself, once it has come to 
rest. It will face the correct direction to continue the race.       
                                                               
MONZA is an excellent circuit to practise on. It's fast with some good
corners that let you get into a good driving rythm. It has also got lots
of open spaces where you can leave the track without crashing into concrete
walls.                                          
                                                               
You are still in the pits, on the jack. Press the selector and when you 
have been lowered accelerate using your controller. You will begin to
move forward. If not then check that you have pressed function function key
F2 and that the symbol is lit on the display.                            
                                                               
When you leave the pits you will join the circuit by driving to one side of
a yellow dotted line. Once you are on the circuit the yellow line will
dissappear and you will see a white long dotted line; like the line that
divides two way traffic in a normal road. Try to line up the middle of the 
steering wheel with dotted line as you move around the circuit.
This is the best driving line; the ideal path to tak so that you can go
into bends at the fastest possible speed.                     
                                                               
The first bend at Monza turns to the left then quickly to the right 
followed by another left and right. This is a double chicane called the
Varainte Goodyear.                                                 
                                                        
If a joystick is being used press SPACE to pause the simulation. 
Otherwise press 'P'.                     
                                                               
You should now see a white sign with a black arrow bending to the left. Then
countdown markers signs; 200 and 100.                     
                                                               
These signs tell you hown many meters to go before the approaching left 
hand bend.                                                        
                                                                      
Steer carefully around the chicane. Try to follow the dotted line even 
though it sometimes appears to be aiming away from the track.       
                                                               
Continue along the short straight and steer around the long sweeping 
right hand corner Curva Grande. You will find that you can drive through
this corner quite fast.                                          
                                                                      
Just after the blue bridge you will see another sign warning you of a 
right turn. This is the Curva della roggia; another chicane.       
                                                               
Sterr through the chicane then carefully along the two right hand curves.
You will then see a long downhill straight.                     
                                                               
Accelarate on the straight.                                   
                                                 
Take time to glance at the red gear indicator on the side of the steering
wheel as the car changes gear automatically. Listen to the sound of the
engine and watch the red power band on the rev counter move up and down
the scale.                                                 
                                                               
At then end of the straight is an unusual chicane called the Variante 
Ascari.                                                 
                                                               
Gradually, you will find that the more you know about the approaching 
corners the easier they will be to drive through at the correct speed.
                                                 
Accelarate along the straight and see if the automatic gear change will
put you into 6th gear before the autobrakes slow you down for the Curva
Parabolica. Don't worry if it doesn't. Try to accelarate around this bend.
                                                        
As you come out of the corner you will see two grandstands, the pits and
a yellow dotted line that marks the pit lane entrance. Keep following the
white dotted line.                            
                                          
You are now in the finishing straight.                            
                                                 
You will then see the starting grid, the 26 spaces where the cars are 
placed to start the race and a thick solid white line across the track will
mark the end of one lap.                                   
                                                 
Cross this line (the Start/Finish line). This is the end of the first lap 
but you will not be given a lap time until you complete a lap started
from the Start/Finish line.                            
                                                 
Continue into another lap. Try to remember the corners and straights. When
you complete the lap you will be given a lap time. Try another lap. Try
to be faster!                                                 
                                                        
                                                        
       CONTROLLING YOUR OWN BRAKES
       ----------- ---- --- ------                     
                                                               
When you feel confident of racing around the circuit. Press Function 
key F1. Check that the first symbol light has gone out. Now, you will
have to control your own brakes.                            
                                                        
Remember how brakes are operated by your controller. Check the section
at the beginning of the manual. This time you will have to cope with 
braking and steering around the same bends.       
                                                               
Try another lap of Monza. It will feel different this time but try to 
gauge the right moment to apply the brakes.              
                                          
                                                 
       CONTROLLING YOUR OWN GEARS.
       ----------- ---- --- ------                            
                                   
Stop on a straight part of the circuit.                     
                                          
After coming to terms with using the brakes press function key F2 once,
and then press function key F6. This will cancel auto gear change and 
switch on the suggested gear indicator. The 'gate' symbol should go out 
and a blue indicator will appear just below the red gear indicator. Now
you will be in control of all gear changes but when you see a number in 
the blue circle that will be the suggested gear to be in at the following
corner.                                   
                                          
Check the method of gear change for your controller.  Practise changinh 
gear and watch the red indicator. Try to get 'N' on the indicator. When 
you are in neutral accelarate. The engine should ref and make a high pitch
noise. The red indicator should move across the curve r.p.m. scale. Don't
worry about damaging the engine.                                   
                                                               
Push the accelarator until the red band is around the 11 mark then press the
selector to change gear but KEEP IT PRESSED IN.              
                                                        
You should have changed into 1st gear; shown by the 1 on the gear change 
indicator (if not then the controller was not press forward when you 
pressed the selector, try again). You will not be moving forward because 
you are holding the car on the clutch (the selector pressed and held).
                                          
Now, with the controller pressed forward, let the selector go!       
                                                               
You will be moving forward. Listen to the change of tone in the engine
noise. The mph indicator should show the speed you are travelling at.
                                                               
Accelarate again and watch the red power band get to about 12 on the dial,
then change up again in the same way as before. The indicator will now 
show 2.
                            
Try to change up to at least 4th gear.                            
                                                        
Then try changing down to take a bend by taking note of the suggested gear
indicator (the number in the blue circle). Note that it is not necessary
to brake when changing down.                     
                                                        
Gear changing is difficult to master even if you are a seasoned driver but
try to experiment with the gear shift. You have 6 forward gears, neutral,
Power Turn (you can only change DOWN into this gear) and Reverse.
                                   
When you are in reverse you will see 'R' on the gaer indicator. Accelarate
with the controller just like in a real car to move backwards.
                                                 
                                                 
       DRIVING INTO THE PITS.
       ------- ---- --- -----
       
When you think you are fanmiliar with the Monza circuit and the basic car 
controls practise driving into the pits. The pits are where all repairs
are carried out and where you are fitted with new tyres.              
                                                               
You will have noticed the YELLOW DOTTED LINE just before the main
grandstand straight. This is the line leading to the PitLane.       
                                                 
Drive a complete circuit, during which at any time you may press 'return'
to inform your pit crew of your intention to stop. You will see the 
pit signal on your instrument panel light up in yellow. This enables you
to enter the pit lane when you see the dotted line. Drive slowly into the
pit lane. You may see several pit crews waiting. As you continue forward
motion aim the car towards the pit bays. The programme will direct you
into the correct bay but you must brake just in front of the crewman
directly ahead of you.                            
                                                        
You will be jacked up and a sign placed in front of the car telling you to
keep your brakes on. A selection of tyre types appears on the digital 
display but don't worry about this for now. Press the selector and you will
be jacked down. You can now drive away from the pits, weave through the 
pit-lane, then carefully re-join the circuit.
       
                                          
       A TIMED PRACTISE/QUALIFYING SESSION.              
       - ----- -------- ---------- -------
                                                               
Press ESC to return to the MAIN MENU. Choose NON-CHAMPIONSHIP RACE and then
QUALIFYING/TIMED PRACTISE. You will be placed back in the pits, jacked up
but this time you will have a monitor appear in front of your car. It will
list drivers in the qualifying session includin yourself (highlighted).
You will also see the tyre choice display A B C D Q W.
       
Q should be chosen but try to move the controller left/right to see the 
effect. Then back to Q. You will be running on qualifying tyres. Good for
about 3 fast laps. You have four sets for this session but you can use
any other tyres if you so wish.                            
                                                               
You are still in ROOKIE level. If you want to drive with Auto Gears, 
Auto Brakes or any other driving aids you can.                     
                                                               
Press the selector. The monitor will move out of the way and your car will
be jacked down.                            
                                                               
Drive away from the pits to the circuit and then complete one lap. You will
not be timed until you have passed the start/finish line. Then you will see
that the car timer has begun. Race around the circuit for 1 lap then, as 
you cross the line your lap time will be displayed. You should return to
the pits now but if you were held up for some time there may be enough 
life in your tyres for another fast lap. Don't push your luck too soon 
unless you want to find out what it's like to drive on bad tyres!
                                                               
Drive to your bay, wait to be jacked up. The monitor should reappear in
front of you with various times from the other drivers in the timed 
practise session. The session last up to 2 hours. To speed up the time
accelarate with the controller. The other driver's times will appear 
very quickly. If you want to go out and beat a particular fast time
accelarate with the controller again to swtich off accelarated time, then 
return to the circuit in the usual way. If you want to leave the session 
press ESC, but all non-selected drivers will complete at least one lap in 
accelarated time before this is implemented.                            
                                                                      
When the qualifiying session is over, you will be shown the results.
Select 'continue' and you will be given the option of a pre-race practise
session. Do not choose this option but go straight into the race itself.
                                                               
                                                               
       A NON-CHAMPIONSHIP RACE.
       - --- ------------ -----                                   
                                                               
                                                               
You will find yourself on the starting grid at Monza with 25 other cars. If
you have achieved a reasonable lap time you will be placed relative to the
other driver's performance. If you failed to get a time, got a bad time,
or have just jumped in at this stage, then you will begin from the rear of
the grid.                                                               
                                                                      
Wherever you are, you will see the starting gantry: a bank of 3 red lights
and a bank of 3 green lights. None should be illuminated.              
                                                               
Wait for the red lights to come on. This is the warning that the start will
take place within 4-7 seconds. Hold the car on the clutch with 1st gear
engaged (see earlier).                                                 
                                                               
When the green lights come on, accelerate!                     
                                                        
Try to keep out of trouble for the first bend until the cars sort 
themselves out.                                                 
                                                                      
Race around the circuit for the number of laps shown on the display but 
keep an eye on the pits indicator (bottom right in the cockpit). If it 
turns yellow you are being called by the radio to go into the pits to 
change tyres or repair damage. Drive into the pits as soon as possible,
you will lose performance if you dont change your tyres. The pit stop will
be timed! If you do not wish to pit inform the crew by pressing 'Return'
which cancels the pit signal.                                   
                                                                      
Complete the required number of laps. When the race is over you will lose
power and then you will be shown the results screen. If you wish to retire
early from the race then press ESC. The race will then be completed for the
other drivers in accelarated time.

If you think you know Monza quite well, after following the Quickstart
tutorial, then you must study all the other 15 tracks with equal 
intensity to win the World Championship at the lowest level with all
Driving aids F1 to F6 turned off and the opposition at their lowest 
performance level but you must know the courses like the back of your hand.
                                                 
                                                 
Making use of the Driving Aids.

You may find that you start the season off with all driving aids on but as
you progress you may prefer to control your own brakes and gears. If you 
win a World Championship, you will only win at the lowest level. You
cannot use any driving aids when competing at Ace Level.       
                                                 
probably the most difficult part of the simulation to master is the 
correct driving line. To win the championship at ace leve youll have to
get used to driving without it. Press F5 to turn off the ideal line and try
to drive around a circuit without it.

SOUND
=====
                                                                      
The sound of the Formula One engine is very important in the simulation 
for, as in real racing, it's a good indication of when to change gear.
                                                        
        Sound (+/-)
                                          
Turn the sound level up and down with the +/- keys.
       
                                   
BASIC DRIVING CONTROLS.
=======================
       
Gear Change: UP                                   
                                                        
The sequence is reverse-neutral-1st-2nd-3rd-4th-5th-6th       
                                                        
Start in neutral. Accelarate with the controller and press the selector 
once, the readgear indicator will show 1 and the car will begin to move.
Accelarate again until the red power band is between 11 and 12 then, while
still accelarating, press the selector. You will now have changed gear, 
the indicator shows the number 2 and the tone of the engine changes. 
Accelarate again and increase the power, then press the selector again.
You have now changed into third gear!
       
Gear Change : Down                                          
                                                               
The sequence is 6th-5th-4th-3rd-2nd-1st-Power Turn-Neutral-Reverse.    
                                                               
With the controller not accelerating, press the selector. The number on the
gear indicator will change down.                            
                                                 
Power Turn :
                            
you can only change down into this gear. If you have not implemented
function key F3 or are racing at a level that does not allow you to use it,
you may recover from any spin by changing down into this gear. The red 
indicator will show a curved arrow.       
       
To straighten out a spin, accelarate from rest, steering momentarily in 
the opposite direction to where you wannt to turn, before steering in the
desired direction, keeping the accelerator depressed throughout, but
change up to first gear as soon as you are facing in the right direction.
       
Reverse:                     
                                                        
You must change down into reverse. Once the R appears on the gear indicator
accelerate with the controller, as in a real car, to move backwards.
                                                                      
                                                                      
COCKPIT CONTROLS
================                            
                                                        
Before you start any race, qualifying lap or practise session you must
familiarise yourself with the MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix cockpit.
You must be able to take in all the information presented to you at a 
glance, because at the speeds you will be travelling on circuits such as
Monza, a lost second is all it takes to make the different between a 
devastating shunt and a brilliant overtaking manoeuvre. At 200mph the car
will travel 90 meters in that second!                            
                                                 
It is very important to know who is behind you and who is trying to 
overtake. Some cars may weave from side to side looking for an opening at 
a crucial corner, be conscious of their prescence. They will try to pass,
if you show any weakness or lave a gap where they might dart past. Whilst
not advocating a breach of racing etiquette it is not unusual for drivers
to 'shut the door' on other cars behind them.                     
                                   
       
Five levels of difficulty (accessed from Main Menu) :
                                   
The difficulty level you have chosen is shown by five lights in a row on 
the left of the steering wheel. If the lowest green light is shining then
you are racing at Rookie level, if the highest light is on then you are
competing at ace level. The levels are related to and control the number
of driving aids you can access. The levels are:
       
       Ace
       Pro
       Semi-pro
       Amateur
       Rookie.
                            
                            
Distribution of Performance (Accessed from main menu)
                                   
Just below the difficulty level indicators there is a panel that shows 
your choice for the distribution of performance among the other drivers.
       
       /
      / = 1991 performance for teams and drivers.
       
     -- = All teams and drivers at the same potential performance.
       
     /\./ = Random distribution of performance throughout the grid.
                     
                     
The Rev Counter :                     
                                   
In the centre of the screen just below the top of the steering wheel you
will see the Rev counter, a long sweepin dial that shows your engine's 
rmp in 1000's from 7 to 14. If you 'blip' the accelerator to rev the 
engine in neutral you will notice that a red band moves across the dial.
This is the most important indicator of how fast your engine is runnung
when in a particular gear.                     
                                   
You must be aware of being in the right gear at the right moment. The basic
guideline is to try and keep the revs up between 10,000 and 12,000 rpm.
Changing into the wrong gear will lose you power or you may overrev and
damage your engine. You should always know the optimum point on the rev
counter for gear changes in order to drop the engine back into the 
meatiest part of it's powerband.                     
                                                        
Gear Indicator :                     
                                                               
To the right of the steering wheel is the gear indicator. This tells you
which gear you are in. There are 6 forward gears, neutral N, reverse R 
and a 'spin recovery' gear.                     
                                   
                                   
Suggested Gear Indicator (Activated by F6) :       
                                   
If F6 driving aid is implemented you will see a blue indicator just below
the normal red gear indicator that tells you the suggested gear to be in 
at the next corner. This is an 'intelligent' aid that will vary depending
on the car set-up, wings, brakes, gears and tyres.       
                                                               
                                                               
Driver Status Indicator :                     
                                                        
On the right of the steering wheel there is another small LED. If it is
green then you are currently in your own car cockpit. If you choose to 
see another driver's cockpit views by pressing the up/down arrow keys,
the light will go off. Unless you are in Replay mode use this facility
at your peril for the car will not be controlled by the computer.
                                          
                                                        
Detail On/Off Indicator (Alt/d) :
                                                        
Just below the gear indicator is the detail on/off indicator. There are 3
levels of detals in MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix and you may step
between them by pressing Alt/D.              
                                                        
At the highest level 2 green triangles are illuminated, and you will see
all the scenery, stands and spectators.                            
                                                               
Press Alt/D once and you will remove all large buildings.
                                                 
Press Alt/D again; smaller buildings, trees and bushes will dissappear.
                                          
A further press will return all original track and landscape details.
                                          
                                                 
Damage Indicator :                            
                                                               
Below the dtail adjust indicator is the damage indicator operated by radio
telemetry from the pits. This shows damage to front and/or rear wings,
and if lit, extreme caution is advised in driving. Returning to the pits
will repair any damage.                                          
                                                                      
                                                                             
Pits Indicator :                                   
                                                 
Below the damage indicator is the Pits indicator operated by telemetry 
from the pits. There are 3 modes:                                          
                                                                      
GREY     : Pits are empty. Call in at any time.
                                                        
YELLOW   : You have been called into the pits or have indicated an 
           intention to call in.                     
                                                                      
RED CROSS: Pits are occupied by your other team car. The pit crew is not
           available to you, so you may have to wait longer if you go in.
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Driving Aids:                                                  
                                                                      
The driving aids panel is the bank of 6 boxes directly below the rev 
counter. Driving aids correspond directly to the difficult level you have
chosen.                                                        
                                                        
F1 Auto Brakes : The computer applies braking functions for you to suit 
                 the circuit, but will not brake to avoid other cars.
                                                                      
F2 Auto Gears  : The computer changes all gears for you when it thinks 
                 it is the appropriate moment.                     
                                                        
F3 Self Correct: In the event of you spinning off the track, when you come
                 to rest, the computer will point you in the correct 
                 direction to continue the race, assuming you are in a fit
                 state of repair.
                                                                         
F4 indestructible: No damage will be sustained in this more, no matter how
                   serious the shunt.                            
                                                        
F5 Ideal Line    : This lays down a white striped line to show you the best
                   line to drive on the circuit you have chosen. Ideally, 
                   you must keep the line on the centre point of the
                   cockpit to get the benefit of the best driving line.
                                                                      
F6 Suggested Gear: Indicates which gear to be in at the following corner.
                                                                      
The driving aids F1 to F6 can be turned on at any time from the cockpit
if you are in rookie mode. However, if you race at higher levels you will
have less help available to you.

During Qualifying/Tinmed practise you will be placed in the pits and a 
telemetric monitor is placed in front of your cockpit. The monitor lists
the other drivers in the race by:
       
       POS            Current grid position.
       N              racing number.
       DRIVER         Driver name.
       LAPTIME        Current best laptime.
       SET            Sets of qualifying tyres used.
       TIME           Amount of time left for practise/qualifying.
       CARS OUT       Amount of cars already out on the track.
                                                                      
If you watch the monitor you will see the other drivers best lap times 
for the circuit. The fastest laptime is placed above all others. You will
be positioned in the middle of the monitor display with your nearest
rivals on either side of you, unless you are the fastest driver!       
                                                                      
You may speed up the time it takes for all drivers to finish qualifying

You begin any practise or timed/qualfiying round session in the pit lane.
From here you can choose to drive staight away with the current settings 
or change any of the car settings. You can also drive into the pits at
any time during practise to change your car set-up.                     
                                                        
For the Rookie driver the car setup will seem very complex at first. Do 
not worry! Accept the current set-up, learn to drive fast around the 
circuits then return to this section and adjust the settings. Do not 
adjust more than one setting at a time before trying it out in a practise
session. That is when you will notice the difference in performance.
                                                                      
Each of the 16 circuits is unique so it's necessary to set up your 
Formula One car with the correct combination of Wing, Gear ratios, 
Brake balance and Tyres. You are advised to study the track layouts and
take note of all the track notes and summaries; these will give you an 
indication of the type of car set-up required but there is no substitute
for experience. Try a few laps with various settings, get an idea of how
the car is running through corners and along straights. compare your 
performance with other cars in practise, go into the pits and adjust a 
setting then try again.                                          
                                                               
If you are having problems with your car set-up and are finding it 
difficult, for example, to drive into corners please consult the setup
problem chart at the end of this section.
       
       
TYRE CHOICE
===========                                   
                                                 
You can choose from a variety of tyres when you are in racing trim and 
you can choose qualifying tyres when you are participating in timed 
practise/qualifying and when you are ready to do a 'hot' lap, otherwise
you can use any of the other compounds. Remember, you are limited to 4
sets of Qualifiers.
                                                 
To change tyres, enter the pits during a race/practise when the pits
indicator signals that your tyres need changing, or press return to
indicate that you are coming in. Or, if in practise mode, press Q to
quit a timed lap immediately.                                   
                                                                      
When you are jaked up, move the controller left/right to make your tyre
selection.                            
                                                        
'D' COMPOUND/VERY SOFT.                            
                                                        
Spongy tyres that ive excellent dry condition grip but which wear out 
quite rapidly and will not last the whole race.              
                                                 
'C' COMPOUND/SOFT                            
                                   
These provide slightly less grip than 'D's but are harder wearing. You will
probably need to change these at least once during a normal race.
                                                        
'B' COMPOUND/MEDIUM                                   
                                                        
These provide less grip than Cs on the track but they are quite hard 
wearing and will usually last for the whole race without needing to be
changed.                                                        
                                                                      
'A' COMPOUND/HARD                                   
                                                                        
A hard tyre that will definitely last the whole race but with less grip in
the corners than Bs.                                          
                                                                         
QUALIFYING TYRES.
                                                               
Good for approximately 3 laps, including the startting and slowing down
laps. Ultra sticky therefore they lack durability. You are limited to 
4 sets per qualifying period. Its sometimes possible to squeeze an extra
lap out of these tyres if you are careful.                     
                                                        
W - WETS                            
                                                               
These tryes have tread for wet weather driving. If the race is in wet 
conditions, wets are always fitted.                            
                                                        
FRONT/REAR WING DOWNFORCE ADJUST.
=================================                                   
                                                               
In general terms the wings on a formula one racer push the car down on the
track. This achieves more rip and less roll giving better control in corners
but less speed on the straights because of the drag.                     
                                                        
You can adjust the amount of front and rear wing used by the car. This is
on a scale from 0 to 64. The higher the number the more downforce. Adjust
the wing front and back by selecting +/-
                                   
                                                               
FRONT/REAR BRAKE BALANCE.
=========================                                   
                                                                      
Grand Prix cars have a low centre of gravity, centered just behind the 
driver. If you brake hard at speed the weight shifts onto the front of the
car. Therefore brakes must be balanced to cope with the transfer of weight
during deceleration (slowing down).                                   
                                                                      
You can alter the brake balance of your car by altering the way in which 
the front and rear brakes are applied. It's always best to have more 
brake bias at the front than at the rear. Ideally, as soon as the front 
wheels begin to feel the effect of the brakes, the rear wheels should
just be beginning to slow down.                            
                                                                      
The scale goes from 32 at the reat to zero in the middle to 32 at the 
front. Move the slider to give you the correct degree of balance.       
                                                               
                                   
GEAR RATIOS
===========                            
                                                                      
You must set the gear ratios of your gearbox to suit each circuit. This
is usually done by setting the 6th geaar for the fastest possible speed
along the longest straight; then setting the lowest gear for the slowest 
corner. The rest of the gears are ranged somewhere between the two.
                                                               
Gear ratio selection is very important. Different cogs can be fitted to 
the gearbox which can have a major effect on the car's acceleration,
performance in bends and top speed.                            
                                                               
Twisty circuits with few long straights and plenty of chicanes demand
'short' gearing for quick acceleration.                            
                                                                      
Other circuits with long straights require 'long' gearing to give the car
the top speed it will need to keep up with the opposition.       
                                                                      
The gearbox has a range from 1 to 64. Move the slider to set the ratio for
each gear.                                                 
                                                               
The nearer the cogs are to each other, the less work the lower gear has to
do to get to the higher gear (short gearing).                            
                                                               
The further away from each other the cogs are the more work it has to do
to get up to the higher gears but the faster the speed at the top gear
(long gearing).                                                        
                                                                      
                                                                      
       
PROBLEM: CAR DOES NOT WANT TO STEER INTO CORNERS.
CAUSE  : UNDERSTEER.
REMEDY : Increase front wing/Perhaps decrease rear wing.
Other  : Move brake balance towards rear/install softer tyres.
       
PROBLEM: CAR WANTS TO TURN INTO CORNERS TOO QUICKLY OR SPINS TO EASILY
         WHEN CORNERING.

         more throttle.
OTHER  : Fit softer compound tyres for faster cornering/Check driving
         line.
       
PROBLEM: CAR DOES NOT GRIP IN CORNERS/OTHER CARS FASTER IN CORNERS.
CAUSE  : NOT ENOUGH DOWNFORCE/TOO HIGH A SPEED.

CAUSES : LACK OF GRIP FROM TYRES.
REMEDY : FIT WET TYRES.
OTHER  : ADJUST DRIVING STYLE TO SUIT CONDITIONS.
       
PROBLEM: CAR LACKS ACCELERATION OVER SHORT DISTANCES.
CAUSE  : GEAR RATIOS TOO LONG
REMEDY : CLOSE DOWN GAPS BETWEEN GEARS.
OTHER  : FIT SOFTER TYRES IF WHEELSPIN IS APPARENT.
       
PROBLEM: CAR HAS A TENDENCY TO SPIN OFF WHEN BRAKING INTO CORNERS.
CAUSE  : UNDERBRAKING/BRAKING TOO LATE.
REMEDY : MOVE BRAKE BALANCE TOWARDS THE FRONT/BRAKE EARLIER.
OTHER  : SOFTER TYRES/INCREASE WINGS.
       
PROBLEM: THE CAR IS SLOW IN CORNERS OR ON STRAIGHTS.
CAUSE  : GEARING.
REMEDY : LENGTHEN THE GEARS.
OTHER  : REDUCE WING.
                                                               
PROBLEM: GRADUAL LOSS OF PERFORMANCE
CAUSE  : TYRES WEARING OUT
REMEDY : FIT NEW SET OF TYRES.
