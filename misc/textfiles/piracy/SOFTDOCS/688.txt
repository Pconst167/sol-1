WELCOME ABOARD 
============== 
 
        There are only two kinds of ships: submarines and 
        targets..... 
 
 
You are hereby given command of a nuclear-powered attack submarine, the 
world's most powerful and versatile ocean-going defense weapon.  You are 
now a hunter/killer, a predator of the deep.  You play a silent, sometimes 
lethal game of hide and seek.  Every minute you make countless decisions 
that may have grave consequences for you, your crew....even your country. 
 
 
 
About the Game 
============== 
 
You command an American Los Angeles or Soviet Alfa class submarine.  You 
prowl through a dark, undersea world, carrying out dangerous missions that 
require predatory cunning and bold action.  In peacetime, you track and hunt 
potential enemies.  In war, you ambush enemy convoys and defend your 
warships; stalk ballistic missile submarines and duel other hunter/killers; 
strike at inland targets from enemy waters and live to tell about it. 
 
All the major systems of a modern attack submarine -- sonar, weapons 
navigation, helm, radio and periscope -- are at your disposal.  Over 40 
separate controls let you feel what it's like to operate the world's most 
sophisticated -- and deadly -- defense technology.  At the same time, crew 
transmissions and pictures remind you that as captain you manage men as 
well as machines. 
 
688 Attack Sub turns the most up-to-date technical information available 
concerning subs into one of the hottest games on the market.  Whether you 
play the computer or challenge a friend to a modem game, you'll get hours 
of pleasure from 688 Attack Sub's exciting graphics, fast pace, attention to 
detail and variety of player options. 
 
 
                                                                        1

Using This Manual 
================= 
 
This manual was written for IBM or IBM-compatible computers.  If you're 
using another type of computer, some commands and features described in 
this manual may be different or unavailable on your computer system.  If 
you're using any computer OTHER than an IBM or IBM-compatible computer, 
please read the Command Summary Card included in the package for 
information specific to your computer. 
 
The manual is both an introduction to the 688 Attack Sub simulation and a 
reference manual.  It's divided into two parts so you don't have to read it all
the way through in order to start playing. 
 
 
Chapters 1-2: Introduction to 688 -- The first two chapters are designed to 
get you into the game quickly and painlessly.  By no means do you have to 
read both chapters -- if you're the type of player who doesn't like to read 
manuals, follow the step-by-step instructions in Chapter 1 and you'll be 
ready to choose a mission and begin play.  However, the fastest way to get 
your finger on the launch button is to let the Quick Start Guide in Chapter 2 
lead you through the first mission, TORPEX '89.  By showing you how to set 
up an attack on several decommissioned warships, the Quick Start Guide will 
introduce you to the sub's controls and basic game concepts. 
 
 
Chapters 3-7: Captain's Reference -- Refer to these chapters only when 
you need to know about something specific -- missions, controls, tactics, 
or ship and weapon specifications. 
 
 
 
Getting Started 
=============== 
 
To play 688 Attack Sub, you need a computer with at lease one floppy drive 
and 384k of free memory.  Your system must be running on DOS 2.0 or 
higher. 
 
688 Attack Sub has an unusually large number of detailed screens, bitmaps 
and text; in fact, over two megabytes of information, all of which had to be 
compressed several times to fit onto the floppies included in the package. 
The result is YOU CAN'T PLAY FROM THE ORIGINAL 688 DISK(S).  Instead 
 
 
                                                                        2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
an install program on your original 688 disk creates a copy of the game from 
which you'll play.  The install program configures the game to your current 
system.  If you upgrade your system, you should create a new copy of the 
game.  The time it takes to make a copy of the game varies depending on your 
hardware.  Although the process can take up to several minutes, we felt the 
extra time was a fair trade for the game's stunning graphics and fine detail. 
 
 
5.25" users: You'll find two disks in the package: Disk #1 and Disk #2.  
During installation, you'll have to swap these disks. 
 
3.5" users: The entire game has been packed onto one disk.  Whenever you're 
asked to insert an original Disk (#1 or #2), insert the single disk included 
in the package. 
 
 
Installing 688 Attack Sub on a Hard Disk 
======================================== 
 
To copy all the files from the original 688 disks to your hard disk, do the 
following: 
 
 
1.  Turn on your computer and wait for the DOS prompt. 
2.  Insert the original Disk #1 in drive A or B. 
3.  Type A: or B: (whichever drive the original disk is in) and press <ENTER>. 
4.  Type INSTALL and press <Enter>.  On slow machines, you may not see 
    anything on your screen for about a minute. 
5.  You'll be asked what kind of disks you want to install the game on.  Type 
    1 and press <Enter> to install the game on your hard disk. 
6.  Next, you'll be asked where the original Disk #1 is.  Type A or B 
    (whichever drive the original Disk #1 is in) and press <Enter>. 
7.  The machine will want to know which drive on your hard disk you're 
    going to install 688 Attack Sub on.  The default drive is C.  Press <Enter>
    to install the game on drive C, or type the letter of the drive you want to
    install it on, then press <Enter>. 
8.  Finally, you'll need to name the directory that the game will be stored 
    under, "688" is the default name.  Press <Enter> to name the directory 
    "688", or type in a new name and then press <Enter>. 
9.  The install program will tell you when to take out Disk #1 and insert Disk 
    #2.  When the installation is complete, put away the original disks for 
    safekeeping. 
 
 
                                                                        3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
 
When you want to start playing: 
 
1. If you have a mouse, plug it in and load your mouse driver.  If you're 
   using a Covox Speech Thing (tm), plug it in too. 
2. Type CD\ and the name of the directory that the game is stored under 
   (for instance, if you chose the default name, "688", you'd type CD\688). 
   Press <Enter>. 
3. At the prompt, type 688 and press <Enter>. 
4. Type in the number of the monitor and color adaptor appropriate to 
   your computer: 1 for EGA, 2 for Tandy 1000, 3 for CGA, 4 for VGA- 
   MCGA, 5 for Hercules. 
5. Type in the number of the sound adapter appropriate to your computer: 
   0 if you only have an internal speaker; 1 if you have an Ad Lib (tm) board; 
   2 if you Covox Speech Thing.  What you hear depends on what 
   you have.  If you only have an internal speaker, you won't hear the title 
   music but you'll still get sound effects (however, a Tandy computer 
   with Enhanced Sound Capability gives you both).  The Ad Lib board re- 
   produces the title music the best, but relies on the internal speaker for 
   sound effects.  The Speech Thing reproduces both reasonably well.  A 
   Tandy with Enhanced Sound Capability and an Ad Lib Board will give 
   you the best sound quality for the game. 
6. Press the SPACEBAR to go directly to the MISSION SELECTION screen. 
 
 
 
Installing 688 Attack Sub on Floppy Disks 
 
YOU CAN'T PLAY FROM THE ORIGINAL 688 DISKS, so you'll have to install 
the game on floppy disks from which you can play.  Please format ONE of the 
following configurations of disks before you do anything else: 
 
        A) two 5.25" 360K floppy disks 
        B) one 5.25" 1.2MB or one 3.5" 1.44MB floppy disk 
        C) two 3.5" 720K floppy disks 
 
See your DOS manual if you don't know how to format disks.  If you get one 
of these messages during installation of game play, do the following: 
 
        Insert the disk with batch file         You should insert your 
        and press any key when ready            copy of 688 Disk #1 
 
        Insert disk with command.com:           You should insert your 
                                                DOS disk 
 
 
                                                                        4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
To install the game on your blank disks, do the following: 
 
1. Boot your system with DOS (2.0 or higher). 
2. Insert the original 688 Disk #1 in drive A or B.  Type A: or B: (whichever 
   contains the original disk) and press <Enter>. 
3. Type INSTALL and press <Enter>.  On slow machines, you may not see 
   anything for about a minute. 
4. You'll be asked what kind of disks you want to install the game on.  Type 
   the number of the disk configuration that's appropriate to you.  2 if you 
   have one 5.25" 1.2MB or one 3.5" 1.44MB floppy disk; 3 if you have two 
   5.25" 360K floppy disks; or 4 if you have two 3.5" 720K floppy disks. 
   Press <Enter> to choose the disk configuration. 
5. The machine will ask if you have these disks ready at this time.  Press 
   <Enter> if you have the blank disks read.  If not, return to DOS by typing 
   NO and pressing <Enter>. 
6. Follow the onscreen instructions.  You'll have to swap disks from time 
   to time.  When the installation is complete, put away the original disks 
   for safekeeping. 
 
 
You only need one drive to play.  When you're ready to start: 
 
1. If you have a mouse, plug it in and load your mouse driver.  If you're 
   using a Covox Speech Thing, plug it in too. 
2. Insert your copy of Disk #1 into drive A or B. 
3. Type A: or B: (whichever contains the copy), the press <Enter>. 
4. Type 688 and press <Enter>. 
5. At the prompt, type in the number for the monitor and color adapter 
   appropriate to your computer: 1 for EGA, 2 for Tandy 1000, 3 for CGA, 
   4 for VGA-MCGA, 5 for Hercules. 
6. At the next prompt, type in the sound adapter appropriate to your 
   computer.  Type in the number of the sound adapter appropriate to your 
   computer: 0 if you only have an internal speaker; 1 if you have an Ad Lib 
   board; 2 if you have a Covox Speech Thing.  What you hear depends on 
   what you have.  If you only have the internal speaker, you won't hear the 
   title music but you'll still get sound effects (however, a Tandy computer 
   with Enhanced Sound Capability gives you both).  The Ad Lib board re- 
   produces the title music best, but relies on the internal speaker for 
   sound effects.  The Speech Thing reproduces both reasonably well.  A 
   Tandy with Enhanced Sound Capability and an Ad Lib board will give 
   you the best sound quality for the game. 
 
 
                                                                        5

Commanding 688 Attack Sub 
========================= 
 
The 688 Attack Sub simulation is divided into levels.  At the top level is 
the CONN (Conning tower), the game's main menu.  From the CONN you can go 
to different STATIONS. Each station is identified by its own icon which 
appears as your cursor passes over the area.

Figure 1.1: 688 CONN 
 
 
 
At each of the stations are controls for different parts of the sub.Some of the
controls are clustered into control groups; for instance, the controls for the 
sound filter, active sonar and towed array make up the Sonar Control group. 
 
The stations and their controls are "hot spots", areas that perform functions. 
You give commands by moving the cursor to a hot spot and press 
<Enter> or clicking a mouse button.  There are two ways to move the cursor: 
 
 
Using a mouse: A mouse (with a Microsoft(r)-compatible mouse driver) is 
by far the easiest way to play the game.  Your cursor will change color and/ 
or shape when it's over a hot spot.  Click any button on your mouse to select 
that function.  If you encounter problems with your mouse, you may have to 
disconnect it and use the keyboard to move the cursor.  Turn to p.34 for 
information on disconnection the mouse. 
 
 
                                                                        6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Using the keyboard: Move the cursor using the <Tab> key and the arrow 
keys.  Pressing <Tab> while holding the <Shift> key down moves through the 
groups in reverse.  Use <Tab> or <Shift> + Tab to tab through the different 
control groups; then use the right and left arrow keys (<- ->) to move the 
cursor between positions within a control group.  The up and down arrow 
keys (^ v) will move the cursor through all the controls regardless of their 
groupings (^ moves the cursor to the left; v moves the cursor to the right). 
 
688 Attack Sub also has quick keys that instantly move your cursor to a 
station of function.  On every screen, each control group has been assigned 
a number -- the number keys will move your cursor to the control groups 
you see onscreen.  The function keys (<F2>-<F10>) take you to the subma- 
rine's stations.  Within each station, different controls have been assigned 
letter keys (for example, pressing R at the Ship's Control Panel will move 
your cursor immediately to the rudder control). 
 
 
For the game's keyboard interface, see the table on the back inside cover of 
this manual. 
 
 
In the rest of the manual, "select" means moving your cursor to a station or 
control and activating it by pressing <Enter> or clicking the mouse button. 
 
 
 
Choose a Mission, Configure 688 
=============================== 
 
Choose a mission (mission descriptions begin on page 18).  Once you select 
a mission, the CONFIGURATION PANEL comes up.  Set the sound, play level 
and whether you want to play by modem (see p.29 for information on 
configuring you computer).  Select BEGIN GAME to start your mission. 
 
 
If you plan on using the Quick Start Guide to TORPEX '89 in the next 
chapter: On the MISSION SELECTION screen, select 688 from the column 
next to TORPEX '89.  Once you've selected the TORPEX '89 mission, the 
CONFIGURATION PANEL will come up.  Make sure to set the CONFIGURA- 
TION PANEL as follows: 
 
1. Select NO MODEM game. 
2. If you have a Covox Speech Thing, select the port your unit is plugged 
   into (LPT:1 or LPT:2). Otherwise, select DEFAULT. 
 
 
                                                                        7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
3. Set the play level on BEGINNER. 
4. Select BEGIN GAME to start playing.  You start in the sub's CONN.  Be- 
   fore you do anything else, you must enter a Security Access Keycode 
   (see below).

Figure 1.2: Radio Room 
 
 
 
You're in the sub's CONN.  You can take your time: the game always pauses 
when you're in the CONN, except in modem games.  Select the Radio Room 
by moving your cursor with the mouse or the <Tab> key until it changes into 
the Radio Room icon.  Enter the Radio Room by pressing <Enter> or any 
button on your mouse while the Radio Room icon appears (you could also 
have pressed R or F2 to go to the Radio Room).  You're given the name of 
a Los Angeles class submarine and the beginning of a sentence (in the 
example in Figure 1.2, the code is "ALBANY: THERE ARE 10 ???").  Starting 
on page 18, you'll find paragraphs marked with the names of Los Angeles 
class submarines.  Find the name of the sub -- they're in alphabetical order 
-- then look at the paragraph that's directly to its side.  Find the sentence 
fragment you see onscreen, then enter the first three letters of the next 
missing word.  For example, the next missing word in the sentence asked for 
in Figure 1.2 is DIFFERENT (p. 18).  DIF would be the letters you'd enter into 
the boxes on the screen. 
 
 
                                                                        8 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Use the arrows below the boxes to enter the letters. When you have the letters
in the right sequence, select SEND CODE.  If you've transmitted the correct 
security code, you will receive your mission orders.  688 Attack Sub will tell 
you if you've sent an invalid code and will put you back in the CONN.  If this 
happens, go to the Radio Room to try again.  You have as many tries as you 
want. 
 
 
Quitting the Game 
 
To quite the game, select EXIT from the CONN.  You'll be given a choice of 
playing another mission, continuing your last mission, or exiting to DOS. 
Select EXIT TO DOS. 
 
 
 
How to Get Help 
=============== 
 
You can get on-line help for all the controls with the Help feature.  Press 
<F1> within each station of from the CONN go get explanations of each feature. 
Press the SPACEBAR to advance through the help screens.  Before you dive 
into the first scenario, try using the help key to take a "walking tour" of 
your sub.  When you're done, you'll at least have a nodding acquaintance with 
all of the game's controls. 
 
 
                                                                        9

QUICK START GUIDE TO TORPEX '89 
=============================== 
 
 
 
As a quick start to 688 Attack Sub, we'll run through the first mission, 
TORPEX '89.  Playing the mission should acquaint you with most of the game 
controls and a few of the strategies.  In TORPEX '89, you're the captain of the
Los Angeles (SSN 688) on a torpedo exercise in the Faeroe Island chain.  Your 
mission is to sink three decommissioned warships without being detected. 
 
During the exercise you'll give commands by moving the cursor to the sub's 
controls and clicking your mouse button or pressing <Enter>.  You can move 
the cursor by a variety of means.  Turn to p. 6, Commanding 688 Attack Sub, 
to learn the mouse and keyboard interface.  For the sake of simplicity, we'll 
use the word select to mean a two-step process: 1) moving your cursor to 
a station or control; and 2) activating the station or control by pressing 
<Enter> or a button on your mouse. 
 
If you find yourself completely clueless about a station, a term, or a control,
press <F1> for help or go to the appropriate section in the manual.  If the 
telephone rings or some other crisis comes up, you can put the game on 
pause by going to the CONN.  When you're reading what to do next in the 
exercise, go to the CONN so you won't lose valuable game time.

1.  Exit the Radio Room.  If you followed the instructions under Getting 
    started in Chapter 1, you've already a) selected TORPEX '89 from the 
    MISSION SELECTION screen; b) configured 688 to your computer on 
    the CONFIGURATION PANEL; and c) entered in the Security Access 
    Code and received your mission orders.  You should now be in the Ra- 
    dio Room of the Los Angeles.  Go to the CONN by selecting EXIT in the 
    top left-hand corner of the screen. 
 
 
2.  Tour the CONN.  You are now in the submarine's CONN.  This is the main 
    menu of the game -- from here you can go to any of the submarine's 
    control stations.  Press <F1> to get the locations and descriptions of 
    each of the stations (within each station, <F1> will tell you what all the 
    controls do).  When you're done with the tour, select the Periscope icon.

Figure 2.2: 688 Periscope 
 
 
 
3.  Go to the Periscope.  You are now at the periscope station.  Look at the 
    map.  You probably see a number of "X"'s.  These are sonar contacts that 
    your sonar operator is picking up.  At this point, he doesn't know what 
    the contacts are or their range, depth or speed.  In this mission, you 
    won't have to worry about unidentified contacts until your sonar oper- 
    ator can identify them.  You'll be receiving sonar contacts and they can 
    be anything from enemy subs to schools of fish.  The ocean's filled with 
    sounds -- the only reliable sounds are the ones your sonar operator 
 
 
                                                                        11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
    can positively identify.  (In combat, however, you might make more 
    guesses.) 
 
 
    Sonar is not the only way to get positive identification of a target -- if 
    it's a surface ship, you can view it with your periscope.  Right now you're
    at periscope depth (20 ft), so go to the PERISCOPE button and select 
    it.  Rotate the periscope until you see the destroyers.  Select TARGET.  A 
    crosshair-cursor will appear in the viewing window.  Place the cursor on 
    the closest ship and press <Enter> or click the mouse button.  Notice the 
    target information that fills the bar at the top of the screen.  Now take a
    look at the top-down map by selecting T on the 9-button map display 
    control in the lower left corner of the screen.  At lease one of the "X"'s 
    should have turned into a letter.  This means that you have a firm fix on 
    the target's location.  If you can't see the letter, the target may be 
    outside the map area.  Select O on the map display control until you get a 
    bigger view of the map.  While your periscope is still up, return to the 
    CONN by selecting EXIT.

4.  Set a waypoint.  While your periscope is giving you a firm fix on your 
    targets, go to the Navigation Board so you can set the auto-pilot to steer 
    your sub toward your targets.  Select SET from the WAYPOINT CON- 
    TROLS.  A crosshair-cursor will appear on the map.  Using the mouse or 
    the cursor keys, move the crosshair to a point near your targets.  Press 
 
 
                                                                        12

    <Enter> or the button on your mouse to select that point.  A number will 
    appear marking the waypoint. 
 
 
    Now that you know the general direction you should be going, return 
    to the Periscope station and lower the periscope to avoid being 
    detected by surface radar.  You may immediately lose the target 
    information at the top of the screen.  Don't worry about it.  After your 
    sonar man has listened for a few minutes, he'll get another fix on the 
    target with his passive sonar. 
 
 
    o  See page 53 for a brief discussion of passive sonar.

5.  Set the throttle and depth.  Even when the ship's auto-pilot is on, you're 
    still in control of the speed and depth of your sub.  Go to the Ship's Con-
    trol Panel by pressing <F4>.  Set the throttle on 2/3.  Select 150 FT 
    under AUTO FUNCTION.  The crew will bring the sub to that depth.  You 
    could also have done this manually using the DIVE PLANE CONTROL. 
 
 
                                                                        13

6.  Load torpedoes.  Torpedoes are never stored armed and ready in a 
    sub's torpedo tubes.  Consequently, you must give an order to ready 
    them.  Go to the Weapon Control Panel by pressing <F7>.  Torpedo tube 
    1 should be already selected (the box around the number will be high- 
    lighted).  Press R or 4 to move the cursor to the box and press <Enter> 
    or click a mouse button to arm and load the torpedo.  Place your cursor 
    on the next tube and press <Enter> once to select the tube, then once 
    more to arm the torpedo.  Do this for all four torpedo tubes.  The two 
    auxiliary tubes hold noisemakers -- don't bother loading them, you 
    won't be needing them in this mission.  The weapon's officer will inform 
    you when each of the torpedoes is armed.  The torpedo icons will also turn 
    a darker color, indicating that they're ready to fire. 
 
 
    o  See page 57 for a brief discussion of noisemakers. 
 
 
                                                                        14

7.  Deploy Towed Array.  Now press <F8> to go to the Sonar Room.  Select 
    TOWED ARRAY.  A towed array is a long cable with a series of micro- 
    phones along its length.  The towed array will improve your sonar 
    operator's listening capabilities but will limit the sub's top speed. 
 
 
    o   See page 47-48 for a brief discussion of towed arrays.

8.  Compress time.  If your sonar man doesn't have a fix on the destroyers, 
    you'll have to wait.  This can take a few minutes.  If you're impatient, 
    go to the Navigation Board and select TIME under WAYPOINT CON- 
    TROLS.  This speeds up the time.  Keep your hand over the <Enter> 
    button.  When your sonar man has a fix on one of the targets, deactivate 
    the time compression by pressing <Enter>. 
 
 
                                                                        15 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Figure 2.8: Weapon Control Panel 
 
 
 
9.  Target and launch.  Go to the Weapon Control Panel.  If the ships are no 
    longer targeted, select TARGET again and move the cursor on the map 
    to the ship you want to attack.  If the range is under 10 miles (the 
    maximum range of a 688 Attack Sub torpedo), you can go ahead and 
    fire a torpedo.  Check that the box around torpedo tube 1 is highlighted. 
    If it isn't highlighted, select it once.  Now select LAUNCH.  It will take 
    more than one torpedo to sink a destroyer, so wait about 10 seconds, 
    then select LAUNCH again.  If you're still out of range (10 miles or more),
    you'll have to move in on the targets.  This may require setting your 
    engine on a higher speed. 
 
 
    The sonar man will confirm if and when the torpedoes have reached 
    their target.  If you think it's worth the risk of detection (and in 
    beginner mode, it probably is), you can go to periscope depth and raise 
    your periscope to confirm a hit (the blood and guts brand of captain does 
    this just to watch the flames rise).  Fire torpedoes until the ship sinks 
    (the letter will disappear from the map). 
 
 
                                                                        16

10. Set up your attacks on the next ship.  If you're lucky, you're already in 
    range to strike your next target. If you're unlucky, you'll have to set 
    new waypoints to attack the other two ships.  Remember that you can set up 
    to nine different waypoints and your sub will go to each of them in 
    numerical order. 
 
 
11. End of exercise.  The exercise ends when you sink all three ships or after 
    15 minutes have gone by.  This is when you receive warm praise or a 
    sound verbal lashing from your superiors.  Don't worry if you didn't do 
    too well this first time around.  Run through the exercise again -- the 
    controls will begin to become second nature and your performance will 
    improve immediately. 
 
 
    You've been introduced to most of the submarine's controls.  There are 
    only a few more that you haven't actually used.  You might want to take 
    a few moments to read up on these as well:

MISSIONS

[Editor's Note: When you next see a name in []'s that is the name and the 
                following paragraph is the paragraph to be used in the 
                determination of the Security Access Code.] 
 
 
 
[ALBANY] 
 
688's perilous missions try the true mettle of a submarine captain.  There are 
10 different missions set in the geographical powder kegs of the world's 
oceans.  the missions progress chronologically from a cold war state of 
mutual distrust to total war.  The challenge of the earlier missions is one 
faced daily by submarine commanders: determining if a situation is threatening 
while trying to avoid ambiguous gestures that could lead to a shooting match 
with foreign submarines.  (Of course, in 688 you're free to "resolve" conflicts
in any way you like.)  The later missions put the commander's abilities as a 
hunter/killer to the test.  In general, the missions become more and more 
difficult -- as the war heats up, each side becomes more and more merciless 
in their hunting. 
 
 
In each mission, the action unfolds within only a small portion of the full 
mission map.  This "playfield" is usually an area of tactical interest to one 
or both sides.  If a player wanders too far away from where the action is, the 
game will come to an end and a message from you CINC (Commander-in-Chief) 
will inform you that you missed the boat.  The idea is to keep the players 
from going off on wild goose chases where nothing will challenge them.

The following brief mission descriptions give you the necessary background 
information that you won't get from your onscreen mission orders.  You can 
choose to command an American 688 or a Soviet Alfa.  Both subs have their 
advantages and disadvantages, but neither sub's abilities outweigh the value 
of a cunning commander.  A note on playing by modem: you can choose to 
play by the mission objectives described here, or you can set your own. 
There are no special objectives when playing by modem.  Whatever objectives 
you declare are valid -- even something as unsophisticated as "turn the 
other guy into canned tuna".  The worse thing that can happen is that your 
CINC will scold you for your runaway battle lust -- and even HE can be 
silenced by the <Esc> key.

688: Your superiors are going to look over your shoulder a few more times 
before they let you sail off with a billion dollar sub.  In this training 
exercise, you only have 15 minutes to sink three decommissioned Forrest Sherman
class destroyers and prove that you're commander material.  Your attack 
must come swiftly and silently.  Navy helicopters will be attempting to locate 
your sub, so don't advertise you position with a lot of active sonar or by 
leaving you periscope out of the water for too long.

700: You command the Dallas (SSN 700) in a joint training exercise with the 
Los Angeles.  In this mission, you earn your commander's respect by beating 
your colleague to the draw.  Sink three of the five de-commissioned warships 
to win the competition.  You can play this on your own (against a computer- 
run Los Angeles) or by modem.  Both subs are equipped with the above 
weapons. 
 
 
 
Modem: TORPEX '89 is the only mission in which you and your modem 
opponent can match Los Angeles class subs against each other.  One side 
commands the Los Angeles and the other commands the Dallas.  For the sake 
of game balance, neither side has missiles in the modem game.

[ATLANTA] 
 
688: American and Soviet naval forces sometimes practice ASW (Anti- 
Submarine Warfare) techniques on each other, rehearsing, as it were, for the 
real thing.  The experience the crews gain and the information gathered on 
enemy tactics apparently make these high-tech games of superpower hide- 
and-seek worth the risk.  In this mission, a Soviet sub is tracking you.  The 
navy brass sees their own pride and budgets on the line, so the pressure's 
on for you to shake this Russian sub.  (See pp. 52-59, Submarine Warfare, for 
tips on maneuvers you can try.)  You must lose the Soviet sub for a period 
of at least 3 minutes in order to be declared successful -- this means that 
the Alfa can't detect you as an "X" (see p. 38, Sonar Contacts).  The mission 
will end once you've successfully evaded your opponent for the 3 minutes 
of after the 20 minute time limit is up.

[AUGUSTA] 
 
ALFA: As in every Navy, the only way up the ladder is by making your 
superiors notice you.  Prove that American high-tech equipment is no match 
for Soviet training and you'll make a big impression on the fleet admiral. 
Since you're practicing for real war, you must track the 688 in such a way that
you'd be able to destroy him if this were a combat situation.  This means you 
may not lose contact with the 688 for any period longer than 3 minutes (to 
keep "contact" on the 688, it must appear as an "X" on a letter on your map 
display -- see p. 38, Sonar contacts).  Don't lose contact on the 688 at the 
last minute or you lose.  You must be close enough to the 688 that you could 
fire on him and easily hit him (see pp. 58-59, Evading Torpedoes, for ranges). 
Try and stay in the baffles (p. 59) of the 688 to stay undetected as long as 
possible.

ALFA: After a week-long operational test in the Barents Sea, you're ordered 
to execute routine ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) maneuvers before re- 
turning to your home port of Severemorsk.  Since imperialist submarines 
sometimes try to follow outbound Soviet subs as they leave home waters, 
you are given the job of "securing the port"--i.e., chasing off any intruders. 
If you use active sonar ("pinging"), enemy subs will know you're there and 
you'll scare them off (see p. 47, TARGETING PULSE).  Be careful, though -- 
spying subs may interpret pings from a long-distance as a prelude to a 
torpedo attack...at which point they may decide to actively defend them- 
selves.  Your best bet is to get as close as you can (under one mile) before 
you actively "ping" them.  At very close range, the risk of being damaged by 
their own torpedoes is too great--they'll be forced to simply run away.

688: Your crew is fatigued from month-long operations in the Mediterra- 
nean, so you're less than happy when your commander reports that there are 
Soviet submarines waiting to "accompany" you out of the Strait of Gibraltar. 
The Navy wants you to make a lasting impression on the Russians -- you 
must pass through the western edge of the Strait undetected by Soviet subs.

Alfa: While returning from tour duty, your sub is suddenly ordered 
back to the Strait of Gibraltar where you'll wait to intercept an American 
attack sub.  Intelligence sources observed a 688 in an Italian port and expect 
it to exit the Mediterranean soon.  You must keep contact on the 688 as it 
enters the Atlantic (see p. 38, Sonar Contacts).  Also, you must be at a range 
at which you could easily destroy the 688 if you had to (see pp. 58-59, 
Evading Torpedoes, for ranges).  Try to be sly about this...active sonar 
will not only make your presence known, it could be regarded as hostile action.

play "to the death", you should concentrate on moving to the west so you 
won't wander out of the playfield and end the mission abruptly.

688: Under new leadership, Yugoslavia attempts to reform their economy 
and widen their autonomy.  To do so, they have chosen a capitalist model 
and have asked for NATO's support.  Perceiving a Yugoslavian alliance with NATO
as a threat to themselves and the other Warsaw Pact nations, the Soviets 
invade Yugoslavia and attempt to set up a naval blockade.  The U.S. and Italy 
agree to provide Yugoslavia with covert military aid.  A Los Angeles class

minimum of exposure. Your job is to get six cargo ships north to Trivat before 
the rebellion is completely crushed.  The Soviet warships have orders to sink 
first, ask questions later--if they get close enough, your cargo ships are 
history.  You can try to lead the warships away, or you can make the seas safe 
for free trade by destroying the warships before they're in range of the cargo 
ships.  The bottom line is: the cargo ships must get northeast safely.

Figure 3.5: Kunashir Passage 
 
 
 
[BOSTON] 
 
688: Sparked by the Yugoslavian conflict, a limited war in Europe begins and 
quickly escalates into World War III.  Your 688 has been assigned to patrol 
an area north of Japan--an important sea lane through which a number of 
Soviet SSBN's (nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines) travel.  A 
Soviet SSBN has reportedly left Vladivostok the day before and is entering 
your patrol sector.  It may be under the protection of a Soviet attack 
submarine (SSN).  Your main objective is the SSBN--think of any 
SSN's you encounter as dessert.  Since slow-moving SSBN's can be extremely 
difficult to detect, a Seahawk helicopter will try to aid you in locating 
it.  If the helicopter finds the boomer, it'll drop a "marker" buoy in its 
vicinity.  The marker buoy floats on the ocean surface and transmits a sonar 
"ping", informing you that it's over the general location of the SSBN.  Your 
sonar officer will inform you when he detects a buoy,  When you get the

message, you should go to a depth of 150 ft or less so that you can target 
the marker buoy.  Note the bearing and the distance of the buoy: If you're too 
far away to launch torpedoes, make a course for the buoy; if the SSBN is close 
enough, launch torpedoes and direct them to the buoy's location, then set 
the torpedoes in a search program.

tok must traverse the Kunashir passage.  This strategically critical "choke 
point" connecting the Sea of Japan with the Pacific is a likely place for an 
American attack on the outbound SSBN you've been ordered to protect. If it 
comes down to combat, don't confuse the SSBN with the 688.  Make sure you 
know what you're firing on, because your torpedoes won't!  The sonar 
analyzer will help distinguish contacts and keep you from firing on 
friendlies (see pp. 46-47, Sonar Computer).

Norwegian Sea is of vital significance to both sides--it represents the only 
access the Soviet Northern Fleet has to the Atlantic Ocean.  If NATO can keep 
the Soviet Northern Fleet "bottled up" in home ports, American and

688: As the war between East an West escalates, the Navy decides that 
forward defense is the only way to force the Soviets to back off.  Forward 
defense attempts to cripple or intimidate the enemy by attacking long range 
targets behind enemy lines.  The next step is to destroy inland targets--in 
this mission, you've been sen to the Baltic Sea to deliver a load of Tomahawk 
cruise missiles that will take out Soviet nuclear weapons facilities.  When the
scenario begins, you're just off the coast of East Germany.  One of the first 
things you should so is raise your periscope to confirm your location.  Switch 
to top-down map by selecting T on the map display.  Zoom out by 
selecting O until you see a letter on the top down map.  The letter is a pre- 
set waypoint for your Tomahawk missiles: this is the target you'll be firing 
your missiles at (Cruise missiles such as the Tomahawk get their bearings by

Don't get too far away from the coast or you'll lose the targeted waypoint for

Sound: If you have a Covox Speech Thing, select the port your unit is plugged 
into (LPT1: or LPT2:) -- otherwise, leave DEFAULT SOUND highlighted. 
 
 
 
[CINCINNATI] 
 
Play Level: 688 Attack Sub comes with two play levels -- BEGINNER and 
STANDARD.  You can choose play levels only when you're playing against the 
computer.  Modem games are automatically set on STANDARD. 
 
 
        BEGINNER -- Gives you certain advantages: you're quieter; your sonar 
        is more powerful than your opponent's; your sub can take more 
        damage; and your raised periscope isn't as noticeable by surface radar.

 
        STANDARD -- You and your opponent have normal capabilities. 
 
 
Modem: Select NON-MODEM if you want to play against the computer.  To 
play against a modem opponent, see p. 30, Playing by Modem. 
 
 
Exit: There are three ways to exit the Configuration Panel: 
 
 
        BEGIN GAME -- Begins the mission you selected on the Mission 
        Selection screen. 
 
        MISSION SELECTION -- Returns you to the Mission Selection screen. 
 
        EXIT TO DOS -- Quits 688 Attack Sub altogether and returns you to 
        DOS. 
 
 
        NOTE: WHENEVER YOU CHANGE THE SETTINGS ON THE CONFIGURATION 
        PANEL, 688 ATTACK SUB SAVES THE NEW CONFIGURATION AS YOUR

Both players must have manuals and play disks of their own. 
 
 
[CITY OF CORPUS CHRISTI] 
 
688 Attack Sub can be played by using two Hayes@--compatible modems with 
a minimum of 1200 BAUD or one null modem cable.  In both instances, one 
player will have to be designated the "originator" and the other the "an- 
swerer". The originator sets up the game and initiates the call (the originator
also foots the bill if there are any phone costs). 
 
There are a few things you should know about playing against a modem 
opponent.  There are no pauses in a modem game.  Any time spent in the 
CONN is time wasted.  Learn the Function keys and use them often to save 
time.  Also, time compression has no effect -- game time runs normally. 
 
 
 
Using Modems 
============ 
 
Preliminaries (both parties): 
 
1. Choose one player to be the "originator" and the other to be the "ans- 
   werer".  Decide which mission you'd both like to play.  Only missions 1, 
   2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 may be played by modem.  While you're at it, decide who 
   gets what side (Los Angeles or Alfa). 
2. Load 688 Attack Sub and select your mission. 
3. At the CONFIGURATION PANEL, each player should select the commu- 
   nication (serial) port his or her modem line is connected to (MODEM 
   GAME ON COM1: or MODEM GAME ON COM2:). 
 
 
What the originator does: 
 
1. Enter your opponent's phone number under SET TELEPHONE NUM- 
   BER.  There are 11 slots for standard phone numbers: enough for a 
   seven digit phone number, a three digit area code, and a single digit 
   prefix (for example, a "1" for long-distance calls).  Select UP or DOWN 
   above and below the boxes to set the numbers.  If you don't need 11 
   digits (i.e., your call is local), leave the extras blank at the end of the 
   number. 
 
 
                                                                        30 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
2. If you're using any special long-distance rate numbers like those of- 
   fered by Sprint, M.C.I. and other companies, dial them now and wait for 
   the second dial-tone.  The modem must detect a dial tone to start.  You 
   can only use special long-distance rate numbers that leave you with a 
   dial tone so that the modem can dial your opponent's phone number. 
3. Select ORIGINATE.  Your computer will now try to establish communi- 
   cation with your opponents computer (a window will appear indicating 
   that the machines are attempting to communicate).  If the call is suc- 
   cessful, the message window will disappear and the scenario will 
   begin.  If the call does not go through, a message will appear telling you 
   so.  Select OK to have the computer try again. 
 
 
 
[DALLAS] 
 
What the answerer does: You have a choice of letting your computer answer 
the phone or answering it yourself. If you're going to let the computer answer 
the phone, select AUTO-ANSWER and wait for the computer to make the 
connection (a message will appear telling you when this happens).  If you 
want to answer the call manually, wait for the phone to ring, then select 
MANUAL ANSWER. 
 
If you can't seem to establish any communication between the modems: 
check the following: 
 
A) Have you entered the right phone number?  If it's wrong, some con- 
   fused soul is getting a very irritating noise at the other end.  Select 
   CANCEL and reset the phone number, then ORIGINATE again. 
B) Did you select the correct communication port?  Check to see which 
   port your modem is connected to and compare it with what you sel- 
   ected on the CONFIGURATION PANEL. 
C) Are you and the other player clear on who's answering and who's 
   originating?  If you're both selecting ORIGINATE, you won't get any- 
   where. 
D) Is your modem working right?  Check your modem manual to see that 
   it's hooked up properly and you're using it correctly.  If you're getting 
   a dialtone but your modem refuses to dial, make sure the Carrier 
   Detect (CD) setting isn't "forced on".  On most modems, Carrier Detect 
   is switch #6 -- it should be in the "up" (or off position. 
 
 
                                                                        31 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
If you get cut off: Your computer will send you a message telling you it's no 
longer communicating with your opponent's computer.  Select OK to have 
the computer attempt to re-establish contact or CANCEL to return to DOS. 
 
Sending messages to your opponent: When you're playing by modem, you 
can use the Radio Room to chat with your opponent.  You can be at any depth 
and you don't need to use your antenna.  Select TRANSMIT and type your 
message on the keyboard.  Pressing <Enter> turns off the transmit mode and 
sends the message. 
 
Playing another mission: After a mission, 688 Attack Sub will maintain a 
connection between you and the other player so you can play another game 
without redialing.  The game ends in the Radio Room so that the players can 
type messages to each other and arrange for another game (see "Sending 
messages to your opponent" above).  Decide what mission you want to play 
and who is going to originate the call (either player can originate).  Both 
players must select EXIT from the top left corner of the Radio Room.  A 
message window will appear in the middle of the screen.  Each player should 
select PLAY AGAIN, then select the new mission.  The originator selects 
ORIGINATE.  The answerer selects MANUAL ANSWER.  (The modems will 
know they're connected and the game will begin without one of the modems 
needing to dial.) 
 
 
[GROTON] 
 
Quitting the game (READ THIS!): The game ends in the Radio Room.  Select 
EXIT from the top left corner.  A message window will appear in the middle 
of the screen.  When you've played all the modem games you're going to play 
for that day, select EXIT TO DOS.  You MUST return to DOS in order to break 
the modem connection.  If you don't, the computer will still maintain contact 
with the other modem...even if you've gone on to play a new mission against 
the computer!  That can add up to big bucks if the call was long-distance! 
 
 
[HELENA] 
 
Getting cut off during your game?  Does your phone have "call waiting?"  If 
it does, you may be getting calls during your games which disrupt the 
modem connection.  You can temporarily stop your "call waiting" service so 
that other calls won't interrupt your game.  In many areas, you can do this by 
dialing *70 on a touch-tone phone or 1170 on a rotary phone BEFORE you 
"originate" or "answer".  "Call waiting" will be cut off for the duration of a 
 
 
                                                                        32 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
single call (i.e., your game).  Note that these numbers may vary depending 
on your location.  Consult your phone company for the numbers in use in 
your area. 
 
 
Connecting the modems with a telephone cable: If your computers are near 
each other (i.e., in the same room), it's sometimes possible to connect your 
modems using regular telephone cable.  Plug one end of the cable into the 
jack marked "WALL" or "LINE" on your modem.  Plug the other end into the 
jack marked "WALL" or "LINE" on the other player's modem.  Whether this 
works depends entirely on the kinds of modems you have.  Some modems 
search for a dial tone before establishing contact with the other computer. 
Obviously, a telephone cable by itself won't produce a dial tone, so this 
method won't work with these kind of modems (if this is the case, you should 
invest in a null modem, available at computer or electronic stores). 
 
 
 
Using a Null Modem Cable 
------------------------ 
 
You can also play a modem game using a "null modem".  A null modem is 
a cable that transmits information from your computer's communication 
port to that of your opponent's.  You don't need modems at all when you use 
a null modem cable -- however, the two computers must each have a free 
serial port connection and be near enough to connect with the null modem 
cable.  Ask your computer dealer for details on where you can get a null 
modem cable.  (See Appendix A for the specific wiring information.) 
 
 
[HONOLULU] 
 
Preliminaries (both parties): With your computers off, connect the two 
computers with the null-modem cable.  Turn on the computers, load the 
game, and go to the CONFIGURATION PANEL.  Select the communication 
(serial) port your null-modem line is connected to (MODEM GAME ON COM 
1: or MODEM GAME ON COM2:). 
 
 
What the originator does: 
 
1. Select MISSION SELECTION and choose the mission.  The side that you 
   (the originator) selects the side you'll play. 
2. Select ORIGINATE. 
 
 
                                                                        33 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
What the answerer does: 
 
1. Wait for the other player to "originate" the contact. 
2. Select MANUAL ANSWER. 
 
 
 
Other Game Controls 
=================== 
 
 
Russian Script On/Off 
--------------------- 
 
The Alfa's controls are in a pseudo-Cyrillic script to remind you that you're 
a Soviet officer fighting for world socialism.  However, we realize that this 
attempt to add flavor may be distracting to some players, so we made it an 
optional feature.  To turn the pseudo-Cyrillic script off, go to the CONN and 
press <Ctrl>-R.  To turn it back on, return to the CONN and press <Ctrl>-R 
again. 
 
 
Sound On/Off 
------------ 
 
Toggle the sound on and off by pressing <Ctrl>-N.  In some circumstances, 
you may want to turn the sound off for a while.  Depending on how fast your 
computer is, sound effects may slow down the rate at which your machine 
is updating the information on your maps.  In some circumstances, this can 
be critical.  For example, if time compression is on, the information lost 
while a sound is being produced could make a big difference. 
 
 
Surrender (modem games only) 
---------------------------- 
 
There may come a time in a modem game where the only conclusion you 
foresee consists of you and your sub scattered across several miles of ocean 
floor.  Rather than watch your crew get transformed into fish food, you can 
surrender by pressing <Ctrl>-K.  It's not the most honorable way to go, but 
it does deny the other player the satisfaction of hearing his torpedoes rip 
into your hull. 
 
 
Turning Off Your Mouse 
---------------------- 
 
If you're having trouble with your mouse, you can turn it off without having 
to disconnect it.  Press <Ctrl>-A to turn the mouse off altogether.  The mouse 
will still be enabled for other software.  To turn the mouse back on, you must 
exit to DOS and reboot the game. 
 
 
                                                                        34 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Boss Key 
-------- 
 
You're at work, and you're escaping the dull monotony of whatever it is 
you're supposed to be doing with a quick game of 688.  Just then, you hear 
the familiar footsteps of your boss drawing closer.  Rather than anxiously 
awaiting the painful attitude adjustment he or she is going to inflict on your 
head, press <F10>.  This will pause the game and replace the screen with a 
bogus DOS prompt.  Wander off to the coffee machine or make it look like 
you're doing something of vital importance to the company.  When the 
offending supervisor is out of view, press <F10> again to resume the 
infinitely more interesting game.  Kids, this works just as well with the 
parental unit. 
 
 
                                                                        35 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBMARINE CONTROLS 
================== 
 
 
Most of the submarine controls are the same for both American and Soviet 
subs -- they look different, and may be on different areas of the screen, but 
they do the same things.  The older Soviet Alfa class sub is missing some 
high-tech equipment, such as the contour imaging display; any exceptions 
pertaining to the Alfa are noted in the descriptions. 
 
 
Reading Your Displays 
--------------------- 
 
 
[HOUSTON] 
 
As an attack boat, your primary role is to stalk enemy vessels.  To success- 
fully do this, you must CONSTANTLY be aware of your position and course 
relative to those of your target(s).  Since in a submarine you can't actually 
see anything around you, you can orient yourself with the aid of top-down maps 
and the contour imaging display. 
 
Top-dow maps are available at all stations except in the Radio Room -- 
where only your location and target information are at hand -- and at the 
Status Panel.  Contour imaging is available at all stations except the Radio 
Room, Status Panel and Periscope.  At the Periscope, the map window 
becomes your periscope view when you raise the periscope.  (Note: the Alfa 
isn't equipped with contour imaging.) 
 
 
                                                                        36

Figure 5.1: Top-Down Map 
 
 
 
[HYMAN G. RICKOVER] 
 
The top-down map gives you aerial perspectives of the area your submarine 
is traversing and displays information collected by your sonar and peri- 
scope.  The area can be viewed from ten different ranges using the zoom 
feature.  On the 688, select I and O from the Map Display Controls to zoom 
in and out.  To zoom in and out on the map aboard the Alfa, select DN and UP. 
Selecting the zoom buttons repeatedly moves you quickly through the 
magnifications.  Your submarine is the fixed point in the center of the screen 
(except at some of the highest zoom levels).  Other information on your maps 
include: 
 
 
Ocean Depths 
------------ 
 
[INDIANAPOLIS] 
 
Different shades on your map designate different depths.  The darker the 
shade, the deeper the water.  (MCGA and VGA graphics modes will display 
more layers between light and dark.)  Depth can vary from 0 to greater than 
2000 ft (since very few submarines can actually dive below 2000 ft, the exact 
depth of really deep ocean doesn't matter).  Always stay aware of the average 
depth of the water you're sailing through (see Heads-Up-Display below).  It's 
possible to run aground -- somewhat embarrassing for a submarine 
commander.  To cross the shallowest waters (the lightest color on your top- 
down map), you'll have to surface. 
 
 
                                                                        37 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Sonar Contacts (letters) 
------------------------ 
 
When you first receive a sonar contact, the ship's computer displays the 
contact as an "X".  An "X" means that you know what direction the sound 
came from.  The target's range, speed and depth are still a mystery.  An "X" 
ALWAYS appears halfway between you and the edge of the display regardless 
of the zoom level.  When your sonar operator gets a fix on a target, it's 
assigned a letter so you can keep track of it.  Letters always mark the exact 
location of a target.  The sonar operator still may not know exactly what the 
target is.  If he doesn't, UNKNOWN SURFACE CONTACT or UNKNOWN 
SUBMERGED CONTACT will be displayed in the target information bar and 
the target's letter will appear dark.  When the sonar operator positively 
identifies the target, the letter will turn a lighter shade.  If a contact is 
lost and regained, it may be assigned a new letter. 
 
 
Waypoints (numbers) 
------------------- 
 
Waypoints (destinations) that you've set are displayed on the map as 
numbers (see Waypoint Controls, pp. 43-44, on how to set and clear way- 
points). 
 
 
Contour Imaging Display 
------------------------ 
 
 
Figure 5.2: Contour Map 
 
 
                                                                        38 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
[JACKSONVILLE] 
 
In 688 Attack Sub, the Los Angeles is equipped with a device called a "side 
scanning sonar" that produces a contour image of the ocean floor.  This is 
useful when traveling near the ocean floor.  A sophisticated, high-frequency 
sonar beam scans the ocean terrain around the bow, port and starboard of 
the submarine.  The beam's high-frequency and short range make it virtually 
undetectable by other ships' arrays -- there are no penalties for using the 
contour imaging system.  With the sonar information, a computer generates 
an image of the ocean terrain around the sub.  Oval shapes designate sonar 
contacts.  The larger the oval, the closer it is to your sub.  The ovals are 
assigned letters, too, which always correspond with the letters displayed on 
the top-down map. 
 
To turn on the contour imaging display, select C from the map display control 
on the left side of the screen.  Use P,F and S to look to port, forward and to 
starboard.  (Note: the Alfa isn't equipped with contour imaging.) 
 
 
Heads-Up-Display (HUD) 
---------------------- 
 
[KEY WEST] 
 
The HUD is an overlay on the map that lets you quickly refer to your sub's 
course and depth.  A compass is displayed along the top of your view screen. 
The white triangle in the middle of the line is your sub's current course.  The
vertical gauge along the right side of the view screen shows your depth 
relative to the ocean floor.  The top marker on the left side of the gauge is 
your sub's current depth.  The bottom marker is the depth of the ocean directly
below you.  Thermal layers are marked by longer lines on the right side of the 
depth gauge.  Always stay aware of how close you are to the ocean floor -- 
keep a safe distance between you and the bottom maker or you may end up 
with a ruptured hull.  In the top left hand corner, the HUD will also tell you 
what direction your periscope is currently pointing. 
 
When you first boot the game, the HUD will be activated.  If it's in the way of
a target you're viewing, you can turn the HUD on and off by selecting H from 
the 9-button map display control of the 688.  On the Alfa, select HUD to turn 
the display on and off. 
 
 
                                                                        39 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Map Display Control 
------------------- 
 
The 688 has contour imaging, and the Alfa doesn't.  Consequently, the 688 
has more map controls than the Alfa.

Target Information 
------------------ 
 
In the box at the top of the screen is the target information: 
 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+ 
|TARGET A: FORREST SHERMAN CLASS DESTROYER                     | 
|BEARING: 185   RANGE: 27   COURSE: 315   SPEED 9.3   DEPTH 0FT| 
+--------------------------------------------------------------+ 
 
[LA JOLLA] 
 
In a typical combat situation, your map will be showing several sonar 
contacts.  Some may have been identified; others may still be undetermined. 
Choose the TARGET command to find out what your sonar operator has 
determined about the various objects in the water.  The things the sonar 
operator is trying to determine are: 
 
 
                                                                        40 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
TARGET: What the target is.  If the sonar operator doesn't know yet, "UN- 
KNOWN CONTACT" will appear here.  Sometimes the sonar operator will 
know whether the contact is on the surface or submerged -- in this case, 
"UNKNOWN SURFACE CONTACT" or "UNKNOWN SUBMERGED CON- 
TACT" will appear here. 
 
[LOS ANGELS] 
 
BEARING: Where the target is IN RELATION TO YOUR SUBMARINE.  It is important 
to understand the difference between bearing and course.  In determining a 
ship's course, the northern point of the compass is the reference point (000 
is North; 180 is south; etc.).  In determining your target's bearing, YOUR 
SUBMARINE is the reference point.  Your bow (the tip of your ship) is 000, the 
location of all other vessels in the water are reckoned from this point. 
Moving clockwise, 090 is to your right (starboard); 180 is behind you (stern); 
and 270 is to your left (port).  In the figure above, the bearing of the 
torpedo is about 045. 
 
RANGE: How far away the target is from your ship.  This is measured in 
nautical miles (nm). 
 
COURSE: What direction on the compass the target is headed.  When reckoning 
course, North is 000.  In the figure to the left, the sub's course is 090. 
 
SPEED: How fast the target is going.  This is measured in knots. 
 
DEPTH: How deep the target is.  This is measured in feet. 
 
 
 
Information Bar 
--------------- 
 
The crew reports to you from time to time to tell you when something has 
happened.  Crew reports and messages run from right to left along the 
information bar directly below the stations controls.  If for some reason a 
message has to be repeated, the message will not scroll from right to left -- 
instead, an audible "click" will tell you that the message currently in the 
information bar is being repeated.  Long strings of messages may interrupt 
your game.  You can make messages go by faster by pressing the SPACEBAR. 
 
 
                                                                        41 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Location and Time 
----------------- 
 
[LOUISVILLE] 
 
On the information bar at the base of the screen are your sub's current map 
coordinates.  To the right of these is the number of minutes that have elapsed 
during your current mission.  Mission time runs twice as fast as real time 
when time compression is activated (this is a rough approximation; the exact 
ratio depends on the speed of your computer).  Time compression isn't 
available in modem games. 
 
 
 
Radio Room 
========== 
 
All missions begin and end in the Radio Room where you receive your CINC's 
warm praise or cold shoulder.  However, this isn't the only function of the 
Radio Room.... 
 
 
EXIT -- Returns you to the CONN. 
 
PERISCOPE -- Raises or lowers your periscope.  You must be at periscope depth 
(20 ft) to raise your periscope. 
 
ANTENNA -- Raises or lowers your antenna.  You must be at periscope depth 
(20 ft) to raise your antenna. 
 
 
 
Message Review 
-------------- 
 
[MEMPHIS] 
 
If messages from the crew are rolling by too quickly and you think you 
missed something critical, you can review the messages in the radio room. 
Select PREV to review the previous recorded message.  It will appear in the 
message bar, only darker than the current messages coming from your 
crew.  NEXT will scroll you forward through the recorded messages until you 
come to the latest message. 
 
 
Transmit 
-------- 
 
If you forgot your mission objectives, you can review your mission orders 
DURING the mission by selecting TRANSMIT and typing MISSION.  You must 
be at periscope depth and your antenna must be up. 
 
 
                                                                        42

[MIAMI] 
 
When you're playing by modem, you can use TRANSMIT to chat with your 
opponent.  For this, you can be at any depth and you don't need to use your 
antenna.  Select TRANSMIT and type your message on the keyboard. 
Pressing <Enter> turns off the transmit mode and sends the message.

Plotting 
-------- 
 
[MINNEAPOLIS-SAINT PAUL] 
 
ALL TRACKS -- Select this to view the tracks of all the targets displayed on 
the screen.  The tracks appear as small dots.  The closer the dot are to each 
other, the slower the target is moving.  All tracks will be black except the 
track of the current target, which will appear as a lighter color (red on most 
screens). 
 
TARGET TRACK -- Displays the target's track only. 
 
PLOT PROJECTION -- Select this to see where you and a target will be in a 
given amount of time assuming you both maintain your present course and 
speed.  You have to use this in conjunction with the TIME PROJECTION 
feature.  Enter the number of minutes you want to project into the TIME 
PROJECTION slots.  Now select PLOT PROJECTION.  A light marker will show 
you what your position will be in the selected amount of time IF you maintain 
your present speed and course.  A dark marker will show the currently 
selected target's projected position.  You can now direct torpedoes to go to 
the projected point (see Torpedo Control on pp. 50-51). 
 
TIME PROJECTION -- See PLOT PROJECTION above. 
 
 
 
Waypoint Control 
---------------- 
 
[NEW YORK CITY] 
 
A waypoint is a destination for your sub.  Selecting waypoints activates the 
auto-pilot, which will steer your sub to each of the waypoints in the order you
selected them.  The auto-pilot won't set your speed for you.  It will adjust 
the speed down to make turns efficiently and quietly.  After making the turn, 
the auto-pilot will return to the previously set speed.  (Note: the auto-pilot 
is programmed not to return to FLANK speed -- if you were at FLANK speed 
and you make a turn, the auto-pilot will only return you to FULL.)  The auto- 
pilot won't control your depth, either, so make sure you're not too close to 
 
 
                                                                        43 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
the ocean floor.  A waypoint is cleared only when you've reached it or when 
you've selected CLEAR. 
 
 
 
SET -- You can only set waypoints while viewing the top-down map.  When 
you select this command, a crosshair-cursor will appear in the viewing 
window.  Move the cursor to where you want your sub to go and press 
<Enter> or any mouse button.  A number will appear on your map marking 
the waypoint.  You may select up to nine waypoints.  The ship's auto-pilot will
guide the sub to each waypoint in numerical order. 
 
CLEAR -- Erases the last waypoint you set. 
 
TIME -- Turns on the time compression feature, making game time go by 
twice as fast (this is a rough approximation: the exact ratio depends on the 
speed of your computer).  Use this to speed up the game during longer 
transits.  Press <Enter> to return to normal time. 
 
 
 
[NEWPORT NEWS] 
 
AUTO-PILOT -- Turns the auto-pilot on or off.  The auto-pilot will only 
function if you have set at least one waypoint.  Changing the rudder will 
automatically turn OFF the auto-pilot.  Changing depth or speed won't 
effect the auto-pilot.  (Note that the auto-pilot is oblivious to the ocean 
depth.  It won't take you to a higher depth if you're about to smash into the 
bottom of the ocean.)  If something comes up and you have to change your course
manually using the rudder (thus turning your auto-pilot off), you can always 
head back to a waypoint as long as it's still set.  Simply turn the auto-pilot 
back on. 
 
 
 
TARGET --  When you select this, a crosshair-cursor will appear on the 
viewing window.  Move the crosshair-cursor with the TAB key or mouse to the 
target (typing the letter of a target will also move the crosshair-cursor).  As
you move the cursor to each of the targets on the screen, all available 
information on the target appears in the TARGET INFORMATION box at the 
top of the screen.  Select a target by pressing <Enter> or clicking a mouse 
button.  Launched torpedoes will head for whichever target is currently 
selected.  Once the torpedoes are launched, however, you are free to target 
any other contacts in the water.

Cavitation Level Gauge 
---------------------- 
 
[NORFOLK] 
 
This gauge monitors the noise produced by cavitation.  Cavitation results 
from partial vacuums that form around the propeller blades when the 
propeller is moving faster than the water around it can follow.  Since the 
bubbles produced by cavitation are very noisy, you want to avoid it as if it 
were death itself.  Two factors are involved here: acceleration and depth. 
Quick acceleration causes your propeller to spin faster than normal, which 
spells more noise.  Depth effects the cavitation level, too.  Since water 
pressure increases with depth, partial vacuums don't form as readily around 
your propellers the farther down you go.  You can avoid high cavitation levels 
by not setting your speed at FLANK or REVERSE.  (Note: THIS GAUGE ISN'T 
AVAILABLE ON THE ALFA.) 
 
 
 
Dive Plane Control 
------------------ 
 
[OKLAHOMA CITY] 
 
Controls the rate at which you dive and surface.  Lowering the handle 
releases air from the ballast tanks, filling the tanks with seawater and 
causing the sub to dive.  Raising the handle releases compressed air into the 
ballast tanks which blows out the water and causes the sub to rise.  How far 
you lower or raise the handle determines how fast you dive or rise -- for 
instance, raising the handle a few degrees will cause the sub to rise very 
gradually, while raising the handle all the way will cause the sub to rise 
quickly. 
 
 
 
Auto Functions 
-------------- 
 
Use the auto functions so you can order the crew to change your depth 
without having to monitor the dive plane. 
 
 
150 FT -- Brings you to a depth of 150 ft. 
 
PERISCOPE DEPTH -- Brings you to periscope depth (20 ft). 
 
EMERGENCY SURFACE -- Brings you to the surface at maximum rate.  This 
can be quite noisy.  Do as it says and only use this in emergencies. 
 
AUTO-PILOT -- See AUTO-PILOT, p.44. 
 
 
                                                                        45 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
[OLYMPIA] 
 
ENGINE CONTROL -- Set your speed with the engine control or throttle.  The 
numbers represent fractions or percentages of your total power output.  You 
can't go to STD (standard), FULL or FLANK at depths of 100ft or less because 
you'd be making far too much noise for your own good.  Use FLANK speed 
to accelerate quickly, but remember that higher speeds have their penalties 
-- not only do you become more audible to enemy sonar at high speeds, you 
can't hear as much over your own engines and the water flowing over your 
hydrophones.  Part of the real art of submarining is knowing when you should 
use high speeds and when you should cut your engines completely.  REV 
(reverse) will slow you down quickly but it is EXTREMELY noisy (the sub's 
propeller is spinning opposite its normal direction, which produces a LOT of 
cavitation, especially between 0 and 100 ft). 
 
 
 
[OMAHA] 
 
RUDDER -- The rudder changes the ship's course PROVIDED you're moving 
forward.  The control is incremented, which means you can control the rate 
at which you change course.  The farther you move the handle to the left or 
right, the "harder" (i.e., more sever) the turn.  Remember that activating 
the rudder will turn off the auto-pilot.

Figure 5.5: Sonar Analyzer. 
 
 
 
[PASADENA] 
 
ANALYZE -- All ships, submarines, torpedoes and marine life make distinc- 
tive sounds.  Each of these sounds has a sound "signature" or frequency 
pattern that distinguishes it from other sounds.  Use the frequency analyzer 
 
 
                                                                        46

to display the sound signature of your current target.  The horizontal line of 
the gauge represents the audible frequency spectrum (left being the low 
frequency end and right being the high frequency end).  The vertical line 
represents the degree of sound received in that part of the frequency 
spectrum.  Different objects will "peak" in different parts of the spectrum. 
Figure 5.5 shows where different objects TEND to peak in the sound spectrum. 
As you can see, ships tend to make more noise in the low end of the 
frequency spectrum; torpedoes in the higher end.  Keep in mind that the 
above diagram is only a rough approximation -- there are exceptions.  To get 
positive identification, you must be able to recognize the individual sound 
signature of an object.  This takes experience.  Remember, it can be well 
worth your while to know the signatures of torpedoes and enemy subs when 
you're surrounded by "unknown contacts"  and you need to act fast! 
 
 
Sonar Controls 
-------------- 
 
FILTER -- Sound waves travel at many frequencies in the ocean.  Generally, 
you'll want to have the filter set on BAND PASS so you can monitor all of 
them.  However, in critical situations, you may have to set this on HIGH PASS 
to filter out everything except high frequency noise.  Torpedo engines make 
noise in the high frequency range, and torpedo sonar arrays usually emit 
high frequency "pings" when actively searching for a target.  Set the filtering

device on HIGH PASS when you want to see JUST torpedoes on your map 
display. 
 
[PHILADELPHIA] 
 
TARGETING PULSE -- The targeting pulse is your active sonar.  Selecting 
this directs your sonar officer to send a sonar "ping" which temporarily 
informs you of everything that's ahead of you.  The problem is, it also alerts 
just about everything to your presence.  (See p. 53 for a brief description of 
active sonar.) 
 
TOWED ARRAY -- The towed array is a long cable with a series of 
microphones along its length that heighten the sub's listening capabilities. 
Figure 5.6 shows the relative listening capabilities of a submarine with a 
towed array and without.

Figure 5.6: Increased Sonar Capabilities With Towed Array 
 
 
 
The disadvantage of dragging towed arrays is that they oscillate at high speeds

(creating a good deal of noise) and produce drag.  For these reasons, towed 
arrays limit the sub's speed: 2/3 in the 688; 50% in the Alfa. 
 
 
[PHOENIX] 
 
Towed arrays can be over 2000 ft long.  Consequently, the towed array must 
be reeled out.  As you expect, this takes a matter of minutes.  Select TOWED 
ARRAY once to deploy the towed array.  Select it again to retrieve it. 
Situations may arise in which you absolutely must accelerate quickly despite 
the fact that your towed array is deployed.  In these situations, you be given 
the choice of cutting the array's cable or not.  Once you've cut your towed 
array, it's gone for the rest of the mission.

opponent's search radar is at your location.  Enemy radar can detect not only 
your raised periscope but the wake it leaves in the water.  This is true for a 
raised antenna as well.  The stronger the ESM signal, the faster you'll be 
detected.  Always lower your periscope or antenna as soon as you can. 
 
 
PERISCOPE -- Raises and lowers your periscope.  You must be at periscope 
depth (20 ft) in order to do this.  Watch the ESM level to keep your chances 
of detection low.  When you raise your periscope, the map display window 
will turn into your periscope view.  You can switch back and forth between 
your map display and your periscope view: select T from the map controls 
to switch to the top-down map, then select C to return to periscope view. 
 
 
PERISCOPE ROTATION -- Use the arrows to rotate the periscope.  The 
direction of the periscope is relative to the bow of your submarine (the bow 
is 000). 
 
 
ANTENNA -- Use this to raise or lower your antenna so you can communicate 
with satellites to receive mission orders and transmit messages.  You 
must be at periscope depth (20 ft) in order to do this.  While your antenna is

Torpedo Tubes and Auxiliary Tubes 
 
[PORTSMOUTH] 
 
The 688 is outfitted with four main torpedo tubes (at the bow) and two 
auxiliary tubes (amid ships) for noisemakers.  The Alfa has six torpedo tubes 
at the bow only,  but the sixth tube launches noisemakers (until you run out, 
at which point it launches torpedoes).  Armed weapons aren't store in the 
torpedo tubes, so you have to order your crew to load torpedoes.  First select 
the torpedo tube you want to arm by moving the cursor to that tube.  You 
 
 
                                                                        49

must arm each tube individually.  Press the activate button to highlight the 
tube's number.  Press the activate button again to start the arming cycle (an 
icon of the type of torpedo in the tube will appear.)  When the weapon is ready

to fire, the weapon icon will change colors.  The weapons officer will also 
inform you that the torpedo is ready to launch. 
 
 
Missile Selection 
 
[PROVIDENCE] 
 
Though the more recent ships of the 688 are equipped with vertical 
launch tubes for missiles, the Los Angeles itself fires its missiles from its 
torpedo tubes.  Since the room aboard a submarine is limited, only a small 
number of missiles may be carried.  Then number and type of missiles are pre- 
selected for each mission and are listed in Chapter 3, Missions (pp. 18-20). 
Missiles are loaded and launched the same way torpedoes are.  Select the 
missile box, then select it again to initiate the arming cycle.  The missile 
icon will appear as long as you still have missiles on board.  When the icon 
turns a darker color, it's ready to fire.  Select LAUNCH to fire the missile. 
Missile specifications begin on p. 64.

Torpedo Control 
 
[SAN FRANCISCO] 
 
The Torpedo Control Functions let you guide torpedoes to a target or location 
or set them on an active search program.  This is useful if your torpedo seems 
to have "lost" its target or in those situations where you don't have a firm 
fix on an enemy vessel that you want to try and take out. 
 
 
[SAN JUAN] 
 
A launched torpedo has a guidance-wire connecting it to your sub.  The 
guidance-wire is 7.5 nm long: once it's cut, you can no longer control the 
weapon.  The weapons officer will inform you when a torpedo has gone off 
course.  The torpedo marker on the map will change to a darker color (red on 
most machines).  A torpedo with a guidance-wire will seek a target until 
it detonates or runs out of fuel. 
 
 
                                                                        50

SELECT -- If you've launched a torpedo and you want to control it, you must 
first press SELECT.  A crosshair-cursor will appear in the viewing window.  Use

the TAB key or mouse to select the torpedo you want to control, then press 
<Enter> or click a mouse button.  Now select one of the following: 
 
        SEARCH -- Sets the torpedo on active search.  The torpedo will run a 
        search pattern and begin emitting sonar pings to help it find a target.

 
        DIRECT -- Select this and a crosshair-cursor will appear on the map. 
        Move the cursor to where you expect your target to be if it maintains 
        its course and press <Enter> or click a mouse button.  Directing a 
        torpedo will only send the torpedo to a specific location -- that in 
        itself isn't enough.  When the torpedo's near its destination, you have

        to set it on SEARCH so it will look for a target.  If you don't 
        initiate a search pattern, your torpedo will drift until it runs out 
        of fuel. 
 
[SCRANTON] 
 
        DETONATE -- Your own torpedo may lose its original target and end up 
        locking on you or a friendly ship.  In a situation like this you may 
        decide it's safer to just blow it up.  Make sure the torpedo is at a 
        safe range -- it doesn't have to actually hit something to do damage.

has damaged one of the ship's systems.  If you need to review the damage 
your sub has taken, press SELECT repeatedly to scroll through the status of 
each of the ship's systems.  All systems will read "OK" unless you've 
sustained damage.  If the system has been damaged, the status bar will tell 
you its operational condition in percentages.  For example, a hard hit to the 
stern could damage the ship's engines.  The status might read: "Engines 75% 
operational".  This would mean you couldn't go faster than 3/4 of your top 
speed.  The diagram shows the sub's major systems -- any major systems 
that have been damaged will be highlighted.  (Note: NO DIAGRAM IS AVAILABLE ON 
THE ALFA.) 
 
Remember that a damaged system is damaged for the DURATION of the 
mission.  In combat, your crew is too busy running the sub to repair anything. 
At any given moment, you have to make do with what you have.

SUBMARINE WARFARE 
================= 
 
 
A submarine isn't much more than an air-bubble enclosed by one or more 
metal shells (hulls) and designed to move underwater at great depths.   All 
submarines must do certain things: submerge, move forward, navigate and 
monitor their surroundings.  Therefore, they share certain design features. 
 
 
Propulsion -- Submarines need power sources to propel them forward and 
  to provide energy for subsidiary systems such as life support, lighting, 
  navigation, weapons control, the periscope, etc.  Internal combustion en- 
  gines, like automobile engines, require air to burn fuel and are therefore 
  unsuitable for use while underwater.  Two sources of power have proven- 
  themselves effective for submarine propulsion, and both have their advan- 
  tages and disadvantages.  CONVENTIONAL SUBMARINES use electric batteries 
  while underwater, but these run down with use and must be recharged by 
  diesel engines.  To do this, the submarine has to return to the surface, at 
  which point it becomes fair game for anybody who wants to shoot at it (it's 
  diesel engines make it pretty audible to enemy sonar, too).  Despite this 
  disadvantage, conventional submarines remain popular among a majority of 
  the world's navies -- they're cheap, simple to operate, and virtually silent 
  when running on battery power. 
 
  NUCLEAR-POWERED SUBMARINES use a nuclear reactor to heat water, which 
  in turn drives a steam generator.  They don't need to recharge batteries, 
  which nicely eliminates unsavory things like range limitations and the need 
  to surface.  However, nuclear-powered submarines are costly and require 
  greater expertise to operate.  Only large navies with huge resources can 
  maintain nuclear-powered submarines in their fleets.  Nuclear-powered 
  submarines have one disadvantage: the pumps they need to cool their 
  reactors make them noisier than conventional submarines.  However, their 
  ability to remain submerged for literally years makes this a suitable risk. 
 
 
Submersion -- Submarines submerge by flooding ballast tanks with sea- 
  water, which causes the submarine to lose buoyancy and sink.  To surface, 
  compressed air is blown into the ballast tanks, forcing the seawater back 
 
 
                                                                        52

  out again.  Ballast tanks can be located within the pressure hull or between 
  the pressure hull and the outer hull.  Some submarines have "saddle 
  tanks": streamlined tanks fitted to the outside of the hull.  Diving planes 
  (fin-like appendages located on the sides near the bow or on the sail) con- 
  trol the angle of the dive. 
 
 
Sensors -- A submarine's most important sensors are its sonar and 
  periscope.  Since the periscope can only be used near the surface, the 
  modern submarine must rely almost totally on sonar for its sensing. 
  Sonar stands for Sound Navigation Ranging and works on the principle 
  that all objects in the water produce sound waves or reflect them and are 
  thereby subject to detection. 
 
  ACTIVE SONAR devices actively emit sound waves (the legendary sonar 
  "ping"), which are reflected back by objects in the water.  Sensitive 
  receivers on board the sub pick up the reflected waves, which are then 
  interpreted by sonar operators using processing devices.  Active sonar 
  devices are usually bow-mounted, though some submarines (such as the 
  688) also have conformal arrays that run along the sides of the sub, giving 
  greater all-around sensing.  Active sonar, though limited by the character- 
  istic features and noises of the ocean, can give you a lot of critical 
  information about the objects directly before you.  The major drawback of 
  active sonar is that it alerts just about everything in the vicinity of your 
  presence. 
 
  PASSIVE SONAR uses sensitive listening devices called hydrophones to 
  pick up sound waves that are already moving through the water.  Passive 
  sonar has the advantage of not alerting everyone to your presence. 
  Unfortunately, it's something more of an art than a science, requiring 
  sophisticated spectrum analyzers, powerful microprocessors, intuition, 
  and, most importantly, TIME.  Passive sonar capabilities can be greatly 
  increased with the use of a towed array, a long, tapered cable with many 
  hydrophones on it.  While a towed array is helpful, it limits a submarine's 
  speed and maneuverability.  Towed arrays are not effective in hard turns, 
  and the fact that they oscillate at high speeds (and create noise) limits the

  overall speed of the submarine. 
 
 
                                                                        53

Submarine Classifications 
========================= 
 
The U.S. Navy typically classifies submarines in two ways.  The first is by the

role the submarine is designed to fulfill.  Traditionally, the submarine's 
strategic purpose has been to hunt and attack enemy surface vessels, 
whether merchant or military.  While this is still a primary function, techno- 
logical innovations have given the submarine new roles.  Refined sensors 
now allow submarines to hunt and attack enemy submarines.  Finally, those 
submarines outfitted with long-range cruise and ballistic missiles can strike 
at land-based targets, too. 
 
 
The role a submarine can perform determines what kinds of weapons it carries. 
Attack submarines such as the Los Angeles generally carry mines, cruise 
missiles of various sorts, and torpedoes.  A few classes of submarines, such 
as the Charlie and Oscar classes of the Soviet Union, are primarily cruise 
missile platforms.  Ballistic missile submarines typically carry long-range 
ballistic missiles and a small number of torpedoes for defense. 
 
 
Another way to classify a submarine is by its means of propulsion.  Subma- 
rines are typically conventional or nuclear-powered (see "Propulsion" 
above).  Thus we have the following classifications: 
 
        SS      Conventional attack submarine 
        SSN     Nuclear-powered attack submarine 
        SSB     Conventional ballistic missile submarine 
        SSBN    Nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine 
        SSG     Conventional guided missile submarine 
        SSGN    Nuclear-powered guided misile submarine 
 
 
 
The Ocean Environment 
--------------------- 
 
Since the ocean doesn't allow much light in, submarines are "blind" in the 
most literal sense.  Consequently, submarines rely on sound to gain informa- 
tion about the things around them.  Sound waves travel through water at 
speeds roughly four times greater than they do through air.  Solid objects in 
the water reflect sound waves, and a sonar operator with a good listening 
device can listen to the sound waves and determine a number of important things
about an object that's near him: what it is, its location and speed, etc. 
 
 
                                                                        54 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
However, the art of sonar is by no means simple.  The ocean is a dynamic 
environment, a fact that has, for better or worse, direct consequences on 
a sonar operator's ability to pick up sound waves.  There are several factors 
which affect the transmission of sound waves, but the most important is 
water density.  Sound waves in water of a consistent density would travel in 
a straight line, but sound waves moving from an area of water with a certain 
density to an area with a different density will BEND.  Two important 
factors affecting the density of water are temperature and pressure. 
 
 
Water Temperature -- Cold water, of course is denser than warm water. 
  Sound waves traveling from warm water into cold water will bend toward 
  the bottom of the ocean (a negative gradient), while sound waves 
  traveling from cold to warm will bend toward the surface (a positive 
  gradient).  The temperature of water decreases with depth, but not as 
  gradually as you might expect.  Instead, the ocean at any given time will 
  be made up of several thermal layers.  The water is normally warmest near 
  the surface, forming a surface duct that can be tens to hundreds of feet 
  deep depending on your location.  Below the surface layer the temperature 
  drops gradually with depth until it reaches another thermal layer (the 
  thermocline).  The temperature falls quite rapidly below the thermocline 
  until it reaches a thin layer near the bottom (the permanent thermocline). 
 
 
Water Pressure -- The greater the pressure, the more dense the water. 
  Water pressure increases the deeper you go, so sound waves bend up 
  with depth. 
 
 
 
Figure 6.1: Thermal Layers 
 
 
 
                                                                        55 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Using the Ocean Environment to Your Advantage -- The complexity of the 
  ocean environment and its effects on sonar can provide the submarine 
  captain with numerous "hiding places" and the sonar operator with nu- 
  merous headaches.  Sound waves are typically "trapped" between thermal 
  layers, forming long sound channels.  A submarine trying to escape de- 
  tection can often cross a thermal layer and stand a good chance of evading 
  enemy sonar.  Even within a sound channel, a submarine is not easily 
  detected.  Look at figure 6.1 above.  Part of the effect of bending sound 
  waves is that they tend to fall into a more or less single, or convergent 
  path.  Convergent paths produce extensive areas where no sonar waves 
  penetrate.  These areas, called shadow zones, can be exploited by subma- 
  rine captains -- a submarine lurking in a shadow zone will be virtually 
  invisible to enemy sonar.  There's no way to know whether you're precisely 
  in a shadow zone or not, but your best bet is to hide just below the thermal 
  layer.  Tactically, this a good place to be anyway: it allows you to quickly 
  move between thermal layers and thus gives you an easy way of "dodging" 
  the enemy's sonar. 
 
 
 
Evading Submarines 
 
There's no foolproof way of evading a submarine that's pursuing you.  If your 
submarine is faster, you can outrun the other sub over the long run -- 
however, this tactic gives the other sub plenty of time to call in help or, in 
combat, to fire torpedoes and destroy you (the noise you create at top speed 
also makes you a great target).  It's better to try and out-maneuver the other 
sub. 
 
The first step is to do something that will make the other sub lose 
contact on you.  You can do this in a number of ways.  As mentioned above, 
slipping across a thermal layer gives the other sub a weaker return signal 
(the sound waves bouncing off of you will tend to stay in the thermal layer 
you're in).  If you're lucky, the other sub will lose contact with you 
altogether.  Another tactic is to cut your engines and drift.  Chances are, 
the enemy has been tracking been listening to your engines turn.  When you 
cut your engines, his sonar operator will have to listen for something else: 
the water rushing over the outer hull, your reactor pumps, etc.  In any case, 
it will take a moment for him to reestablish contact on you. 
 
 
                                                                        56 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Once you think the other sub has lost contact on you, change course.  The 
more unexpected the new course is, the better.  You can turn to the side, turn 
180 from the other sub's course and duck under him, or attempt to circle 
around and start tracking HIM.  Combining maneuvers is effective, too.  You 
can cut and drift, change course, drop below a thermal layer, then change 
course again and silently speed off.  The more imaginative and complex the 
move, the better your chances of survival. 
 
 
 
Using Noisemakers 
 
Noisemakers are devices you fire from your torpedo tubes that simulate the 
noises produced by your submarine.  Enemy sonar -- whether submarine or 
torpedo -- may be temporarily deceived into thinking that the noisemaker is 
actually your submarine.  Figure 6.2 shows the effective use of noisemakers 
(the example demonstrates one sub evading another, but the principle is the 
same for evading a torpedo).  Sub A is being pursued by sub B.  At 1., sub A 
cuts his engines and drifts.  Sub B immediately loses contact with A.  2. Sub 
A releases a noisemaker to distract his pursuer.  At the same time, A makes 
a hard turn to either the right or left (in this case, the right).  Sub A 
can now use other maneuvers: he can dive below a thermal layer, or, while 
he's still drifting, he can circle around and attempt to hide in sub B's 
baffles. 
 
In combat, against torpedoes or submarines, noisemakers can only help you 
survive.  However, in peacetime, it may not be such a good idea to release 
noisemakers in order to evade another submarine.  Since noisemakers are 
released by compressed air through torpedo or auxiliary tubes, the other sub 
has no way of knowing whether you're launching a noisemaker to evade him 
or a torpedo to kill him!  He might answer your call by launching several 
torpedoes in your direction. 
 
 
                                                                        57 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
Evading Torpedoes 
 
Torpedo Limitations -- There are no foolproof ways of evading torpedoes. 
  Modern torpedoes are intelligent and capable of recognizing decoys and 
  executing search programs.  However, all torpedoes had limitations 
  which a knowledgeable submarine captain can exploit.  Like a submarine, 
  a torpedo relies on sonar to pinpoint its target; however, the torpedo's 
  relatively small size limits the area it can sense.  Its cone of vision -- 
  the area is actually "sees" or senses -- is small (perhaps on 20 degrees 
  wide directly in front of it) compared to a submarine's.  If a submarine 
  captain can quickly maneuver his ship out of the torpedo's narrow cone of 
  vision, the torpedo will have to initiate a search program in order to try 
  and find him.  Torpedoes are fairly "stupid" in the sense that their 
  reactions to a lost target are very mechanical.  A torpedo doesn't have the 
  facility to "guess" where the target went when it escaped the torpedo's 
  sight.  The torpedo can only initiate a pre-programmed search pattern, which 
  might very well take it in the wrong direction, giving the submarine a chance
  to slip away. 
 
  Torpedoes are also limited by the amount of fuel they can carry.  This gives 
  them a maximum range -- a point at which they run out of fuel and sink 
  to the bottom, where they self-destruct.  In reality, torpedo ranges vary 
  from type to type.  However, in 688 Attack Sub, all torpedoes have a range 
  of 10 nm (see Designer's Notes, p. 68).  This makes it possible to outrun 
  torpedoes in certain circumstances. 
 
  Like submarines and ships, torpedoes also have a maximum Rate-of 
  Heading-Change (RHC).  The RHC is nothing more than how tightly the 
  torpedo can make a turn.  A torpedo's RHC is pretty good in comparison 
  to a ship's, but a torpedo can't run on a dime -- after all, it's swimming 
  at speeds greater than 45 kts!  A submarine captain can maneuver such 
  that the torpedo is forced to turn in order to keep the target in view.  If 
  the torpedo's RHC can't compensate for the change in the target's course, the
  torpedo may "overshoot", loosing the target altogether. 
 
 
Responses to a Torpedo Attack -- Figure 6.3 shows three evasive measure 
  sones (A, B and C,), each demanding a different response on the part of the 
  submarine captain.  The numbers represent the approximate range of the 
  torpedoes -- notice that the range at which an evasive measure should be 
 
 
 
                                                                        58 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
taken depends largely upon the torpedo's bearing.  For example, if the 
torpedo's bearing is 000, you'd have to take action sooner than if the 
torpedo were coming from behind.  Why?  Because at 000, you and the 
torpedo are headed for each other -- the gap between you and the torpedo 
is closing fast. 
 
A) At long range, you should turn and out-run the torpedo.  All torpedoes in 
   the game have a range of 10 nm.  You only need to stay ahead of the torpedo 
   for a few miles and it will run out of fuel. 
 
B) At medium range, turn so your sub is heading 90 degrees away from the 
   torpedo's course (choose the shortest path to get there).  If you're real 
   lucky, you'll escape the torpedo's narrow cone of vision, which will force 
   it to initiate a search program to look for you. 
 
C) At short range, the best you can do is turn so your sub is heading 150 
   or 210 degrees away from the torpedo's course (choose the shortest path to 
   get there).  Hopefully you'll escape the torpedo's cone of vision or turn 
   so fast that the torpedo will "overshoot", giving you time to make a clean 
   get away. 
 
 
 
The Baffles 
 
Both the wake a submarine leaves as it moves through the water and the rota- 
tion of the screw (propeller) disrupt the transmission of sound directly behind
the sub.  The "baffles" are, in effect, the submarine's blind spot.  Even a 
towed array, though diminishing the size of the baffles, does not completely 
eliminate the problem.  The experienced captain stays aware of the fact that 
he sense virtually NOTHING to a narrow area astern. 
 
 
                                                                        59

Although you can only play a Los Angels or Alfa, other submarine classes 
make their appearances in one or more of the missions.  The following 
specifications will help you know what you're up against should you encounter 
one of these submarines.  For the sake of convenience, we've chosen to call 
the Soviet subs by their USN designations, even when you're commanding the 
Alfa.  SInce very few players speak Russian, this probably won't be missed 
much.  Note that some of the specifications have been altered to balance game 
play, particularly the maximum depth of certain Soviet submarines (see p. 68, 
Designer's Notes).

Weapons 
------- 
 
The following weapons are used in the game by or against submarines. 
Those multitude of weapons used by ships against airplanes, missiles, land 
targets or other ships are not described here since they have little impact on 
the submarine commander.  Weapons flagged with icons are actually used 
in the game by the 688 or Alfa.  All other weapons described here appear in 
the game but are used by ships or other subs. 
 
 
Torpedoes 
 
688 Attack Sub was designed to be a "hot" game, demanding quick 
responses and daring moves on the part of players.  Real submarine combat 
may be intense, but all truth be told, there's a lot of waiting for things to 
happen -- courses to be plotted, contacts to be identified, missiles to fly... 
A computer game can't reproduce this aspect of naval combat and still call 
itself a game: the excitement has to be the grab-you-by-the-shirt-collar 
variety.  With this in mind, the entire game was "scaled down" so that the 
ranges at which things happen were greatly reduced (see p. 68, Designer's 
Notes.)  The result was that ALL torpedoes (Soviet and American) were given 
an artificially short range of 10 nm.

ASROC     US      2-10km  Secret  MK 46     The ASROC (Anti-Submarine Rocket) 
Anti-                             Torpedo   is the principal ASW weapon of the

                                            consists of a ballistic rocket 
                                            carrying a Mk 46 torpedo.  The 
                                            rocket drops the torpedo by para-

Ships 
----- 
 
As a submarine commander, you need to know as much about your targets as you 
do about your own submarine.  A ship's noise level will give you an idea of 
how easily it can be tracked, while its type, size and maximum speed will tell 
you how easily it can evade your attack.  The kinds of weapons a ship carries 
are also important -- they determine what the ship can do to your torpedoes 
and missiles as well as your submarine.  Armed ships generally rely on a three 
point system of defense against incoming missiles and torpedoes.  Surface-to- 
air missiles (SAMs) and anti-torpedo missiles are the first line of defense, 
typically being employed against long range targets.  If missile defense is 
unsuccessful, guns will be used.  Phalanx and chaff make up the last line of 
defense.  Ships will attempt to protect each other as well as themselves, 
firing at missiles and torpedoes destined for other ships.  Keep this in mind 
when setting up attacks on convoys and battle groups -- take out warships 
first.  Be wary around any ships carrying depth charges, depth bombs, and 
anti-submarine (A/S) torpedoes or missiles (ASROC and SS-N-14's).  The latter 
are particularly dangerous because of their long range.

Designer's Notes 
================ 
 
By Paul Grace 
 
 
    When John, Randy, and I started 688 Attack Sub, we wanted to design a game 
where the strategic and tactical decisions that confront the player occur at 
a reasonably exciting pace.  An attack sub isn't a jet fighter, of course, but 
we felt that a submarine game's potential for excitement and serious challenge 
was at least equal to that of an air combat simulator -- and given the things 
that today's billion-dollar subs can do, the potential might even be greater. 
 
    However, creating a submarine game that's both reasonably accurate as a 
simulation yet exciting enough to play as a game presents certain problems. 
For example, a long-range (two-speed) torpedo can travel up to 40 miles, at 
speeds between 20 and 50 knots.  Its run time could easily end up being more 
than 30 minutes long.  If we changed the game scale so that this is compressed 
to a reasonable time frame for a game (say one or two minutes "real time"), 
 
 
 
                                                                        68 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
 
then the speed of a helicopter (or worse, a missile) is so great that it can't 
even be represented! 
 
    To overcome this difficulty, we had to throw out "conventional" game 
design theories (as might be published in trade journals) and invent something 
truly radical.  By selecting a "combat range" on the order of 15 miles, we've 
brought real excitement to an otherwise slow process.  The game scale is such 
that ships move at a reasonable rate, torpedo run times are short enough to 
provide a fast feedback loop without the need for too much time compression. 
(In fact, by using this technique, time compression runs the entire game, not 
a simplified statistical model.)  The bad news is: many weapons have incorrect 
maximum ranges. 
 
    Furthermore, (or, as we say at Electronic Arts, Farthermore,) we had to 
simplify several features present in modern submarine warfare.  Some of these 
modifications were trivial (modern SONAR sounds more like a "warble" than a 
"ping").  Other modifications had real game impact -- for example, we decided 
to place the appropriate weapons on board your vessel at the start of each 
mission, which improved the play balance of the missions greatly.  The US 
enjoys some strong advantages in weapons, and we wanted to focus on specific 
problems facing hunter-killer commanders, not the intricacies of weapons 
selection.  For similar reasons, we left out nuclear "superweapons" that would 
rob you of long-term satisfaction.  You'll have to pretend you've used them 
all up, you're stuck with what you have.... 
 
    Please, NO telephone calls regarding the top speeds of the various 
submarines modelled in the game.  The published data in Jane's Defense Weekly 
seems ludicrously low, while other sources would have us towing water-skiers 
behind our beloved Los Angeles.  We picked what WE felt were reasonable 
speeds, and then balanced the game around those speeds. 
 
 
 
Good hunting,
