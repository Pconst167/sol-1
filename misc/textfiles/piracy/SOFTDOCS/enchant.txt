         THIS DOC WAS TYPED FOR ME BESTEST AMIGA BUDDY -= TROUT =-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

LONG AGO IN A LAND FAR FROM OUR OWN IN TIME,SPACE AND DIMENSION,THERE LIVED
OF THE MOST WICKED AND EVIL WITCHES THAT THE UNIVERSE HAD EVER KNOWN . THEY
RULED THE NOW  FORGOTTEN LAND OF ENCHANTIA AND COMMITTED THE MOST TERRIBLE
DEEDS WITHOUT CAUSE OR REASON. THE INHABITANTS OF ENCHANTIA PRAYED FOR THE
DAY WHEN THE EVIL HOLD OVER THEM WOULD BE VANQUISHED AND THEY COULD FINALLY
LIVE IN PEACE.

ONE OF WITCHES OUTSHONE THE OTHERS IN HER MALEVOLENCE AND DEPRAVITY;SHE HAD
FOUND A SPELL THAT WOULD ENSURE HER CONSTANT YOUTH.HOWEVER SHE WAS FINDING
IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ALL THE INGREDIENTS SHE NEEDED. THE MAIN INGREDIENT
WAS A LIVE MALE CHILD AND ALTHOUGH SHE KNEW WHERE SHE COULD GET HER HANDS
ON ONE SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW.MALE CHILDREN LIVED IN ANOTHER DIMENSION,
ANOTHER TIME,ANOTHER WORLD.THE WITCH WOULD NEED A PORTAL AND MORE MAGIC
THAN SHE POSSESED.

SHE WAS NOT TO BE DISCOURAGED AND SET ABOUT HER MASTER PLAN.BY PERSUADING
TWO OTHER WITCHES TO VISIT MEDIAEVAL EARTH ON THE PREMISE OF
DESTRUCTION,HOLOCAUST AND MAYHEM SHE COULD SOLVE THE PORTAL PROBLEM. THE
TWO WITCHES AGREED TO THIS DANGEROUS TASK AS THEY WERE LED TO BELIEVE THEY
WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO GET THERE AND BACK.HOWEVER WHEN THEY ARRIVED IN THE
NEW WORLD THE TASK OF OPENING THE PORTAL TOTALLY DRAINED THEIR POWER.THE
EVIL WITCH FROM ENCHANTIA SENT A "DISPERSE AND CLAIM" SPELL THROUGH THE
PORTAL AND HIT THE TWO WITCHES WHO HAD NO MORE POWER WITH WHICH TO PROTECT
THEMSELVES.THE SPELL CONSUMED THEM AND DISPERSED THEIR ESSENCE AND SOULS
OVER THE FIELDS IN WHICH THEY WERE STANDING.FROM ENCHANTIA THE EVIL WITCH
WAS HEARD TO SAY "FROM THIS DAY FORTH THERE WILL ALWAYS BE COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THIS FIELD AND ENCHANTIA"

WITH ONE TASK COMPLETE,THE EVIL WITCH NEEDED MORE POWER TO ENABLE HER TO
RECANT THE REJUVENATION SPELL ONCE SHE HAD OBTAINED THE INGREDIENTS.TO DO
THIS SHE NEEDED POWER FROM ALL THE OTHER WITCHES IN ENCHANTIA.SHE NEEDED TO
TRICK EACH OF THEM IN TURN INTO LENDING HER THEIR POWER SO SHE COULD MAKE
EACH ONE YOUNG AGAIN.OF COURSE EACH WITCH GAVE IN TO THEIR OWN VANITY AND
LENT HER THEIR POWER.SHE NOW HAD ENOUGH TO INVOKE THE REJUVENATION SPELL.

IN THE FEW YEARS THAT PASSED IN ENCHANTIA MANY HUNDRED PASSED IN OUR
WORLD.DURING THIS TIME A GREAT CITY HAD BEEN BUILT IN THE POSSESED
FIELD.THE FIELD HAD NEVER BEEN BUILT UPON AS ALL THE LOCAL PEOPLE COULD
RELATE STRANGE HAPPENINGS AND EXPERIENCES THERE.HOWEVER LOCAL CHILDREN
OFTEN PLAYED BASEBALL ON THE FIELD.

ON ONE PARTICULAR DAY OUR HERO ,BRAD WAS PLAYING BASEBALL WITH HIS SISTER
JENNY.BACK IN ENCHANTIA THE EVIL WITCH IS LOOKING AT THE FIELD THROUGH THE
PORTAL.HUNGRILY AND EXCITEDLY SHE INCANTS A SUMMONING SPELL .BACK IN THE
FIELD JENNY PITCHES A BALL TOWARDS BRAD, HE SWINGS THE BAT IN A WIDE ARC
AND....BANG!!!

GAMEPLAY
--------
WHEN BRAD AWAKES HE FINDS HIMSELF HUNG UP HIGH ABOVE THE FLOOR IN WHAT
LOOKS LIKE THE DUNGEON OF THE CASTLE WEARING SOME STRANGE MEDIEAVAL CLOTHING
.IT IS NOW UP TO YOU  TO HELP BRAD ESCAPE FROM THIS MYSTERIOUS LAND AND 
AND BACK TO HIS HOME . AS HIS JOURNEY TO ENCHANTIA WAS SOME WHAT UNEXPECTED
BRAD IS HARDLY PREPARED FOR HIS JOURNEY THROUGH THESE STRANGE AND UNKNOWN
LANDS .AT LEAST HE MANAGED TO GRAB HIS TRUSTY BACKPACK BEFOR LEAVING THE
FIELD.
BRADS QUEST IS MADE ALL THE MORE DIFFICULT  WITH THE FACT THAT A MYRIAD OF
PUZZLES WILL HAVE TO BE SOLVED IF HE WANTS TO MAKE IT IN ONE PIECE  TO THE
LAIR OF THE EVIL WITCH EQUIPPED TO DO BATTLE SOME OF THESE PUZZLES ARE
LOGICAL WHILST SOME ARE A LITTLE MORE OBSCURE

OBVIOUSLY BRADS FIRST PRIORITY IS TO STOP HANGING AROUND AND GET OUT OF
THESE CHAINS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE .WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HELP YOU SHOULD
FIND IT QUITE EASY TO OBTAIN A KEY BUT WILL THIS ENABLE YOU TO ESCAPE THIS
DAMP AND CRUMBLING DUNGEON.
