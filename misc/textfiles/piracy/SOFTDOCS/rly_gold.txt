       This document describes advanced new features in RELAY Gold
       version 4.0 which are NOT present in the current printing of
       the RELAY Gold User Manual. Also, certain previously
       documented features are described here in more detail.

       The majority of this document is intended primarily for users
       of RELAY Gold's Script Language. If you do not write scripts
       for automating RELAY Gold tasks, you should only need to read
       through page 3.

       To print this document, simply issue the DOS command:

		      GENERAL RELAY Gold FEATURES
		      ------- ----- ---- --------


1) When using VT240 graphics, you may save a graph using the script
   command "SAVEGRAPH fileid" (which is listed in the User Manual
   only for 3279 graphics). This graph may be viewed or printed
   outside of RELAY Gold using the supplied DOS command
   "VIEWG240 fileid".


2) When installing RELAY Gold on either two 360K or a single 720K
   floppy disk, the Color, Queue, and Tone managers are not available.
   Also, VT240, 3101-20, and 3279 graphics terminal emulations are not
   available due to disk space restrictions.

   There are no restrictions if you are installing RELAY Gold on a
   single 1.2M or 1.4M floppy disk or on a "hard" disk.


3) The COM3 and COM4 ports on a non-PS/2 system are now supported by
   RELAY Gold. To use these, use a port number of "13" for COM3 or
   "14" for COM4. Ports 3 and 4 are used for PS/2 systems only,
   which support up to 8 COM ports.

   Advanced users may wish to note that the port names used are
   "COM3PC" and "COM4PC". These are specified on the "Advanced
   Communication Options" screen, which follows the "Personal
   Computer Options" screen.


4) If you wish to have RELAY Gold answer a telephone call on a ring
   other than the first, setup the following commands in your Offline
   Profile, file "RELAY.OFP":

	 GLOBAL &$MRINGS
	 &$MRINGS = n

   Where "n" is the ring number to answer on (2 for the second ring,
   3 for the third, and so on).

   Please note that this feature is only available with modems which
   use the "AT" command set, such as the Microcom and Hayes modems.


5) Expanded Memory handling has been dramatically improved in
   RELAY Gold 4.0, resulting in a reduction of the required
   base DOS memory support to as little as 128K.

   RELAY Gold now uses EMS memory for its communication buffers
   when there is insufficient system memory available. Normally,
   this is handled automatically based on the amount of memory
   available or that specified by the "/ST:nnn" startup option.

   If you desire, the selection of EMS memory may also be controlled
   manually via the new startup options:

	 "/COEMS"   means "ALWAYS use EMS for communication buffers"
	 "/NOCOEMS" means "NEVER use EMS for communication buffers"

   NOTE: RELAY Gold requires that a contiguous 64KB page frame be
   available for EMS use.


6) RELAY Gold's editor may now use EMS memory for its "spill file".
   That is, parts of a file being edited which cannot fit into
   memory will be temporarily spilled over into EMS memory.

   In order to enable this feature, use the startup option "/EDEMS".
   That option MUST be specified when starting up RELAY Gold if
   you want the editor to use EMS memory. If you want to use the
   /EDEMS option always, place it in the DOS environment via the
   command "SET RELAYOPT=/EDEMS" (as described in the User Manual).


7) The YMODEM file transfer protocol is now supported by RELAY Gold.
   Various new "file protocol" values may be entered on the
   communication option screens:

	 Y   = Single-File YMODEM (also called XMODEM-1K)
	 YB  = "Batch" YMODEM
	 YG  = "Streaming" YMODEM for error-correcting modems
	 YBG = "Streaming" and "Batch" YMODEM

   Note: Script programmers may refer to the SET PROTOCOL and YMODEM
   script commands described later in this document.


8) 3287 printer emulation has been added to RELAY Gold when used in
   conjunction with the RELAY/3270 mainframe software product. Specify
   a 3270 model number of "2P", "3P", "4P", or "5P" to create a printer
   session with a simulated 3287 buffer size of 1920, 2560, 3440, or 3564
   characters, respectively.

		     ADVANCED RELAY Gold FEATURES
		     -------- ----- ---- --------


9) The ability to create new "system" script variables has been added.
   As with RELAY Gold's predefined system variables, these user-defined
   variables are read-only and common to all sessions.

   To define a new system variable, use the command:

	 DEFINE &variable = "expression"

   Usage Notes:

	 A) The "expression" argument may be either a constant or
	    contain other script variables. The value of "expression"
	    is substituted each time the new variable is referenced.
	    For example, to create a variable containing the date and
	    time, do:

		  DEFINE &DATI = "&DATE &TIME"

	    The current date and time will be substituted each time
	    that &DATI is referenced (this will NOT be the date and
	    time that the DEFINE command was issued).

	 B) A new value may be assigned to a system variable by
	    reissuing the DEFINE command. Any attempt to assign a
	    new value by other means (for example, an assignment
	    statement) results in the creation of a local script
	    variable having the same name.


10) The editor may now be used to edit binary files which have a
    one or two byte record length prefix before each record. For
    example, RELAY/VM and RELAY/TSO download variable-length
    binary files in this format when the NOCONVERT option is used.
    To edit such a file, issue one of the script commands:

	 "EDIT fileid LENGTH V1" - for a 1-byte prefix
	 "EDIT fileid LENGTH V2" - for a 2-byte prefix


11) The WAIT.COM file documented in the User Manual is no longer
    supplied with RELAY Gold. Use the WAIT script command instead.
    WAIT.COM is still available on the RELAY Bulletin Board.


12) The script command "SET 3270COLOR" only accepts the values "ON"
    and "OFF". The values "HIGH" and "YELLOW" listed in the User
    Manual are not supported.

13) The "/SL:0" option documented in the User Manual should NOT be
    used unless you are developing applications using the RELAY Gold
    Toolbox.


14) Certain 3270 emulation boards do not properly respond with screen
    changes to RELAY Gold. A new option has been added to account for
    these boards. Issue the script command "SET 3270REREAD ON" if you
    seem to be missing screen updates for the following 3270 boards:

	 ITT Courier's "ITT IRMA 7580"
	 ITT Courier's "ITT IRMA 95437i"


15) The SET FRAMESIZE command now accepts several alternate sizes which
    limit the amount of data sent in each block when using RELAY Gold's
    proprietary protocol. This may be useful in certain host and network
    environments. The additional sizes supported are: 64, 96, 120, and
    240 bytes.


16) Certain non-standard "AT" command set modems raise the "Carrier
    Detect" signal when answering the telephone even if no modem is on
    the calling side. For these modems, RELAY Gold will display the
    Terminal Screen even though no connection was actually established.
    If you encounter this problem, you may tell RELAY Gold to ignore
    the extraneous Carrier Detect signal by placing the following
    commands in your Offline Profile, file "RELAY.OFP":

	 GLOBAL &$MRLSD
	 &$MRLSD = "OFF"


17) A new option has been added to the script command OPEN: Specifying
    the SHARED keyword when opening a file for random access (via the
    LENGTH option) allow multiple users to read and write the same file
    simultaneously. For example:

	 OPEN "N:OURFILE" AS #1 LENGTH 16 SHARED

    Please remember that actual data written to the file may not be
    processed by DOS until the CLOSE command is used. To update the
    file contents without actually closing the file, use:

	 CLOSE #1 TEMP


18) The SET PROTOCOL script command has been enhanced to support the
    YMODEM file transfer protocol:

	 SET PROTOCOL YMODEM

	 -- Sets file transfer protocol to "Single-File" YMODEM

	 SET PROTOCOL YMODEM BATCH




	      (c) Copyright 1985,89 by Microcom Software Division
  10/18/89	 Undocumented Features in RELAY Gold Version 4.0      Page 6


	 -- Sets file transfer protocol to "Batch" YMODEM

	 SET PROTOCOL YMODEM G

	 -- Sets file transfer protocol to "Streaming" YMODEM

	 SET PROTOCOL YMODEM BATCH G

	 -- Sets file transfer protocol to "Streaming and "Batch" YMODEM

     The YMODEM script command sets various protcol options used during
     a file transfer. These have the same functions as the corresponding
     options documented for the XMODEM command in the RELAY Gold User Manual:

	 YMODEM CANCEL ON/OFF
	 YMODEM CHECK CRC/SUM
	 YMODEM RETRIES n
	 YMODEM ITIMEOUT n
	 YMODEM RTIMEOUT n


19) The SET BREAKLEN option now accepts a value of zero. This value
    disables the transmission of all break sequences. It is useful
    with some networks and protocol converters which do not properly
    handle breaks.
