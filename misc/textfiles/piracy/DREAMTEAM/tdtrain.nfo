Hey I NEED AN INFO FORM!!!

Flash Back Mega Trainer.. By Martial Artist / TDT (Yeah!)

To whom it may concern...
This is a really cool game.  Play it, the trainer makes it REALLY FUN.
This Trainer may be a little late, that is because of a few reasons.
1) Just joined TDT
2) waited to get a trainer loader screen going (didn't happen)
3) screwing around with the game made it even better

Included in this package are.
FBTRN.COM  < the trainer itself
FBPATCH.EXE < a crack patch.

I included a crack patch, because I noticed that a ways through the game
it does another SECURITY CHECK.. My crack patch solves this.

INSTRUCTIONS:

FBPATCH.EXE < put this file in your Flash Back Directory and run it
              This will patch the FB.EXE file so that you will get by
              the SECOND (FLT?? nice one!) DOC CHECK in the game.

FBTRN.COM  < put this file in your Flash Back Directory and run it.
             This will enable you to use the following keys during game play.

     F1:  pressing this key moves yer little guy 16 pixels to the right.
          this is great because it lets you go through unopened doors.
          it even puts you through walls.

     F2:  pressing this key moves yer dude 16 pixels to the left.

     F3:  pressing this key moves yer boy 16 pixels down.

     F4:  pressing this key moves yer man 32 pixels up.
          if there is a platform above you, move yer guy in the direction
          of the platform while you keep hitting F4, this will make yer
          guy walk up and diagonally, so you can get to anywhere in the
          screen..

     Insert: Pressing this moves yer man to the upper left corner of the
             screen.
     Delete: Pressing this moves yer man to the lower left corner of the
             screen.
     Home:   Pressing this moves yer man to the upper right corner of the
             screen.
     End:    Pressing this moves yer man to the lower right corner of the
             screen.
     These are all very useful keys, as it gets you places instantly, and gets
     you out of a lot of jams too.

The above keys are really fun and very useful, they can also be very dangerous.
Be careful how you use them or you might find yourself on another planet.
Remember what keys to what.

     F5:  Pressing this key gives yer little dude 254 health points..
          you can press it anytime to regenerate the points.

Well that is it.. The keys make it REALLY fun, TRUST ME!!!!

INFORMATION FROM MARTIAL ARTIST!!!!!!!
Well I guess this is my official resignation to Public Enemy, as you can see
I joined the Legendary TDT.
Why do I resign PE?? well a lot of reasons, some of which you don't need to
know, but things are just too chaotic over there, I don't even know who
the hell I would call to tell that I am resigning.
But doesn't matter, I am with a group now I can feel I can live with.
No hard feelings to anyone,

Hawk >> hmmm just didn't call me, you understand this more than anyone...

I would mention other PE members, but the only other one I talked to was
Flash, and he was always sleeping on the phone..

I am glad you let me in Hard Core!!!!! hopefully we can get some cool shit
out like this trainer....
