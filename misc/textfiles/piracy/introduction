        For a history of this package, see history.txt.

        The emphasis on this package is for GAME GROUPS,
        and in particular, for DECEAST groups.  Since hybrid/prestige
        class/celebre/etc are still going, and/or died in late 1996,
        i did not emphasise to collect them.

        Any current group members with a collection of NFO's please
        contact me.

        I Hope you enjoy this pack! Please keep checking the WWW page,

        ANY group with a "#" beside it indicates this group has NFO's
        BEFORE 1990. these groups are of particular interest, as is ANY
        nfo from before 1989.
        
        The following is a current tally of GAMES GROUPS
        directories, and approx. how many .NFO's are contained within.

SECTION 1.3 - BRIEF SCENE TORORIAL:

I will merely show you the OLDEST groups and nfo's i have and tell you the
basics in chronological order.


OLDEST CURRENT VERIFIED NFO: in 1980's - ultimaiv.doc - 1987

OLDEST GROUP NFO: Bently SIdewell Productions - in /bsp

OTHER OLD FOUNDING GROUPS:

        group name              dir in collection
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        PTL club - in           /ptl
        Public Enemy  in        /pe
        the FiRM  in            /firm
        Miami Cracking machine  /mcm
        cpi2001                 /cpi1002        ?
        ffa                     /ffa            ?

        (any group marked with ? means i know NOTHING about them)


Please note that MCM merged with some other group to form INC, and THG
is also a second generation pirate group.  A lot of INC and THG
came from the c64 scene, but we don't want to go that far back.

Now, groups like THG/INC defined the scene. they standardized the .NFO,(thg)
invented couriering (thg), and invented the utils release group (inc)

Inc/thg were the main players in the scene , with all kinds of other groups
showing up including trsi, public enemy, the FIRM, razor 1911, and
others.  Groups like FLT/TDT/RAZOR/ spawned AFTER these guys started dominating,
so these are basically third generation groups.

any group that started after 1991 is basically typical of the groups
you find today, not much has changed, except for the internet. =)


That's it. not much eh? well i don't know all that much about the early
scene, and that's what is facinaating. If you have any pieces
of the picture that could help, please do tell me.

Section 1.3 - RULES for contributing:

        1) ALL CONTRIBUTIONS MUST BE IN .ZIP FORMAT

        2) ALL .NFO'S MUST HAVE THE ORIGIONAL FILEDATES!
                - archiving the nfo's preserves the dates.

        3) ALL NFO'S MUST BE ORGANIZED INTO A DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
           SIMILAR TO THE ONE SEEN IN THIS ARCHIVE!

        3.5) Please try to dupe check the NFO's if possible  so you don't
             send me any duplicates.

        4) PC RELATED NFO'S ONLY!                                 
        



----------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 1.4 - Contributing! i have an interesting concept!

        Do you wish to contribute to this package? Would you like to
        organize and control a particluar aspect of this collection?

        Currently things that can be taken on by individuals would include
        the following types of NFO files:

        Courier groups
        Utility Groups
        BBS/FTP ads
        YOUR LOCAL SCENE (ie: 416/905, 212/718, etc)
        anything else? (art scene? <G>)

        If you want to do amiga/console, do it seperate. as of now the
        console section is discontinuted.


        If you have already made such a thing, I can add it to this collection
        in a directory, provided you orgznise it's directory structure, and
        handle ALL readme files (or tutorials, etc).

        ON a LAST note (wow if you read this far you are really interested)
        The collection is VERY unorganzied within directories. MANY dupes of
        nfo's COULD exist. IF ANYONE wants to write s small program to help
        organize this collection or something feel free to!

        All people who contribute can be given credit, and/or space to say
        anything they want in these files.

Section 1.5 - HISTORY

A Brief history of the NFO pack is as follows:

        While searching through old disks, and looking through NFO's
        i was marking the disks that had neat NFO's on it for later
        reference.  I thought "why not collect 'em on my hard drive?"
                                                             
        So i took them and put them in a directory called d:\nfo =)

        Eventually i gethered a LOT of nfo's from various sources, and
        decided to organize them into directories.

        I decided to go on a limb, and advertise a plea for MORE nfo's
        on my web page.  I updated my page, put in the pleas, and let
        stuff rest.

        A few days later, People like Rage (paroxyism), and Sargonnas were
        telling me they had a bunch of NFO's to trade. SO i traded what they
        had for what i had, and the collection was placed on the web for
        public download.

        Eventually, i had given the pack to many people, put it online at
        a private site, and people were contributing to it. Many people
        like Sector 9 (razor founder), trademark (former crue member, very
        closely affiliated with THG) contributed loads of very valuable NFO's
        to the collection.

        I thank ALL contributors (expecially the first two), or else
        the collection would not have happened =)

        Oldschool BBS archives like 2112, gave me MANY of the PRE 1990 NFO's
        that i have today.

        IN any case, now I have decided to keep things going, seeing that
        there is MUCH improvement to be made in the collection, there is
        a lot of history to be acquired.

Where is this collection going:

        The main purpose of this package, is to provide a SOLID reference
        into the old scene.  This collection contains information about the
        scene, enough so to know what was going on.

        Basically this thing is the LARGEST public library of what happened
        in the scene in the early days.  MUCH of what happened prior to 1990
        is very shaky, and i hope to gether NFO's and inforation from oldschool
        dudes who were there to give input/NFO's.  And that is my main goal:
        to COMPLETE the scene archives, and make sure they will live on for
        the entire life of the scene.
