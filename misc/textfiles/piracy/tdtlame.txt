       In this textfile, I will rag on TDT and the whole bunch of lamers
       associated with them. Also, I will explain WHY I'm doing this. The
       reason is the recent release of Might & Magic IV by FairLight, TDT
       and of course RAZOR. First off, the Razor version was the only one
       that has been put out COMPLETELY CRACKED AND WORKING unlike the
       Flt and TDT versions. Now, two days later TDT puts out a "crackfix"
       which is supposed to be 100% and that "you can use on the Razor and
       FLT versions". Of course I was very suspicious about TDT's late
       fix and so I downloaded this shit and looked at it since they
       claimed that there was more than ONE doc check in the game. Here's
       what I found....

쿟DT - how stupid they REALLY are....

       OK, let's start. I will explain a _little_ of tech background to
       you so that you're able to understand what I'm talking about.
       The actual protection routine in Might & Magic IV is located in
       a file called XEEN.DAT. This file is not a data file, but a renamed
       EXE file. Also, New World Computing used PKLite to compress it and
       make it harder to change stuff in it, however, we all know how to
       get rid of PKlite, don't we ?

       OK, well, after I got rid of PKLite I ran a filecompare between my
       version and the one TDT put out. Here's the result:

       Comparing files XEEN.DAT and MYXEEN.DAT
       0001DD2A: 8E 38 <컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
       00026C9D: 90 9A <컴컴                         
       00026C9E: 90 00 <컴컴                         
       00026C9F: 90 00 <컴컴                         
       00026CA0: 90 CC <컴컴                    this is the only
       00026CA1: 90 15 <컴컴                    byte required to
                                                crack the game.
                            
                     these are the bytes TDT
                     changed to "crack" the game.

       Now, here's a litte explanantion of the bytes and what they mean.
       If you don't know alot of assembly, don't worry if you don't
       understand it. Actually the whole point of all this is that the
       TDT version IS NOT WORKING ! Hahaha... Yes, you got me right.
       TDT FUCKED UP THEIR CRACK, if you try to bypass the protection,
       THE GAME WON'T LET YOU CONTINUE PLAYING.

       Let me just explain what I did to crack the game:
       The first byte you see at 1DD2A is an offset for a JMP instruction.
       The original value in an uncracked version of MMIV is 8E and to
       crack the game I changed it to 38. The reason is that the JMP
       originally leads to the protection routine that asks you to enter
       a certain word from a certain page in the manual. What I did is
       to bypass the protection check in a way that the routine assumes
       that you've already entered the correct word. That's why in my
       version the protection doesn't even show up anymore. Also, that
       way I don't have to worry HOW MANY protection checks there are in
       the game. No matter how many times the protection routine is called,
       it will ALWAYS return the correct result and let you go on playing.

       Now, in the TDT version SOMEONE thought he has to be a REAL smartass
       motherfucker. Here is what the dumbass did:
       Translated to assembly, the five bytes starting at 26C9D will come
       out as a FAR call instruction

       CALL 15CC:0000

       This CALL will lead to the protection and ask you for a word
       from the manual.

       TDT's lame-o cracker changed this CALL-instruction to something
       else:

       NOP
       NOP
       NOP
       NOP
       NOP

       Well, what the dick was trying to do is to bypass the protection
       simply by not even CALLING the protection routine. So, what's
       wrong you may ask, if the protection is not even called, what is
       Onyx moaning about !? Well, let me explain.

       First of all there might be more than ONE call to the protection in
       the game. The way I cracked it, the protection may be called 100reds
       of times and each time it will come out fine, but in the TDT version
       you can't be sure that there's not another CALL to the protection
       somewhere else in the game. So, how do you fuckers in TDT even DARE
       to tell people that "there's more than ONE check in the game", eh ?
       DON'T YOU LAMERS UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE
       CHECK, YOUR GODDAMN VERSION WILL NOT WORK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
       BECAUSE YOU ONLY REMOVED *ONE* OF THEM ? Fuck you lamers, you should
       go back to cracking school and LEARN how to do things correctly.

쿟DT - my grandma can do better cracks 
읕컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴켸

       Now here's what's even WORSE about TDT's crack:

       Due to the fact that the file XEEN.DAT is an EXE file, it contains
       lots of addresses that have to be relocated when the file is loaded
       to memory. This is refered to as the relocation table. I will not
       go into a too much detailed explanation of the EXE file structure
       here, but it all comes down to the fact that Sir Platinum doesn't
       seem to know a shit about DOS and EXE files.

       Each entry in the relocation table points to an instruction of
       the program that needs to be altered to make the program work.
       Something called a SEGMENT-OFFSET has to be added to some instructions
       to make them work correctly. In this case, the CALL instruction that
       TDT changed needed to be relocated. To make it a little bit more
       understandable for you, here's an example:

       un-relocated instruction:         bytes in memory:

       CALL 15CC:0000                    9A 00 00 CC 15

       Now, let's assume the program has been loaded to segment offset 1234
       the whole thing would look like this AFTER the relocation:

       relocated instruction:            bytes in memory:

       CALL 2800:0000                    9A 00 00 00 28

       The segment offset of 1234 has been ADDED to the original offset
       of 15CC. The result is 2800. This is how it SHOULD look like.

       Now how did TDT fuck up ? Here's how....
       Since DOS does an automatic relocation of all entries in the
       relocation table, it will not check if the relocation it just made
       was VALID. To cut a long explanation short, here's what it looks
       like with the TDT version:
                     ^^^
       un-relocated instruction(s):      bytes in memory:

       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90

       After the relocation process....

       relocated instruction(s):          bytes in memory:

       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90
       NOP                                90
       LES SP,[BP+SI+0509]                C4 A2 ....

       The offset 1234 has been added to the 9090 bytes that represtented
       the NOP instructions.

       Due to the fact that Sir Platinum changed the original JMP
       instruction to NOP instructions, the relocation will create
       a new, UNPREDICTABLE instruction instead of the NOPs. As a
       result THE GAME MIGHT EVEN CRASH ! YES, YOU GOT IT RIGHT, THE
       WAY TDT CRACKED THIS MIGHT CRASH THE GAME ! Fuck you kids...
       You apparently don't know a flying fuck about what you're doing.

       Don't you fuckers know that according to what is added to your
       NOP instuctions the actual CODE changes every time ? The instruc-
       tions created might be total NONSENSE and lock up the game.
       Goddamnit.... you lamers are so fucken stupid, you shouldn't be
       allowed to touch games like Might & Magic IV since all you do is
       to FUCK THEM UP.

       OK, Sir Lametinum, here's what you COULD have done even tho it
       STILL wouldn't get rid of ALL the doc checks in the game, just
       this particular one:

       9A 00 00 CC 15          CALL 15CC:0000

       could have been changed to

       90                      NOP
       EB 02                   JMP IP+02 <커jumps OVER the relocation
       CC 15                   XXXX        쿽ffset.
       ..                      ..<컴컴컴컴켸
       .                       .

       Obviously you're not a proffessional cracker, just a little dumb-o
       wannbe that still has alot to learn to play in the MAJOR LEAGUE
       together with the BIG BOYS....

       Also, to all of you out there, take this as a WARNING and think twice
       before you decide to download a TDT release in the future. Who knows,
       the "change" they make to a program might accidently format your hard
       drive....

       GO FOR QUALITY - GO FOR RAZOR RELEASES ! WE KNOW OUR BUSINESS !
