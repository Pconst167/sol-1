    Release Notes
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Tyranny strikeforce comes through again, proving that it will take more
    than some golf courses to push us down to #3!  Enjoy this awesome game!

      "Years ago, the story is, a lone Orc made an amazing discovery.  What
    he found was a mystical place where strange armor lined the walls,weird
    mosaics lined the floors, and dead center,on a pedestal,stood a massive
    tome.  An ancient Dwarf took the job of translation. He determined that
    it was a religious tract from the land of Amorica dedicated to the lost
    god Nuffle. The warrior bands competed both to eliminate each other and
    with an inflated pig's bladder, attempted to "score". The rules in full
    were divulged, abd thus the Dwarven translator became the leagues first
    Sacred Commissioner and took the equally sacred name of Roze-El.
       An so, the NAF or Nufle Amorican Football League was created.  Teams
    of many diffirent races  decided that worshipping  this newly found god
    Nuffle would  let them  take out their  aggressions on hereditary foes,
    maybe make some money, and probably have a pretty good time."

    BLOOD BOWL from MICROLEAGUE is a strategy football game with the twist.
    Play it the barbaric way where your two best strategies are to score...
    and to inflict as much damage on the opponents' team as possible!   Set
    in the fantasy world where you control teams of humans, orcs, elves and
    dwarves - each with their own strong points and weaknesses.  This great
    conversion of a popular board games is  definately something to try for
    any sports simulations or strategy fan!
