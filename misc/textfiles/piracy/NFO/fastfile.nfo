 |  Welcome to the Fastfiles traders information file!                      |
 |  We are a young and dynamic group that would do its 100% best to make    |
 |  the old days of FAST FILES alive again! ;)                              |
 |  Our group only contains fast couriers , there is no such thing in our   |
 |  group such as Seniors / Members / Distro's and other kinds of "doing    |
 |  nothing" jobs..  every one in Fastfiles is courier , even the leaders!  |
 |  Now that is what a REALY good couriering group should be like!          |
 |  Our goal is to deliver more speed and quality to the scene than massive |
 |  uploading and trading..  and we believe that we will , and fast!        |
 |  The group , unlike many other courier groups , contains traders which   |
 |  has got lives outside the scene and are not 24hrs a day sitting next    |
 |  to their computer , waiting for new 0-10 seconds releases to download!  |
 |  NO!  we believe that traders should have freedom too , and our traders  |
 |  can be inactive for half a year but still return as fresh as new!       |
 |  We are not pushing on our members to trade as much as they can , each   |
 |  of our members is loyal to the password : "speed & quality first ,      |
 |  mass and big credit next!"                                              |
 |                                                                          |
