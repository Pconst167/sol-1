NOTES:
    þ Make sure that DSZ.COM or DSZ.EXE is in the same directory
    þ Also make sure that the DSZ file is not compressed
    þ Run DSZREG.COM DSZ[.COM | .EXE] to register any version of DSZ

                          ð  C H A N G E S  ð

NO  þ The serial number patched into either will be $09002991

YES   Now DSZREG generates a pseudo-random number and uses it as
      a seed and starting point for finding you a unique serial
      number.  Plenty of serial numbers for everyone, now.

NO  þ Coming Soon: DSZ Seek & Destroy v1.2, with serial number
      generator built in, so you have your own, semi-unique
      serial number in each copy you have

YES   It's here right now; the version number, though, has been
      incremented to 2.0  -- unless there are some bad bugs, and I
      don't believe there are, this will be the final release.

NO  þ Why not in this one?  I dunno.  The code's already written.
      That's a good question.  For sample output of the code, see
      the file called DSZ.REG within this ZIP...

YES   The file DSZ.REG is still in this ZIP, I suppose just to pad
      the ZIP a bit so we all get more upload credits.  Oh well...

NO  þ Currently allocates a maximum of one segment for patch
      space, so this program will be fine until DSZ gets bigger
      than 64K in length.

YES   As long as the serial number shows up within the first 64K
      of the program, you're still OK.  I wrote DSZREG to load in
      the first 64K of the program, scan it for the serial number
      location, and finally save the offset for patching purposes.
      It would be trivial to have DSZREG just scan the file for
      the offset, so we'll see if the need ever arises.
