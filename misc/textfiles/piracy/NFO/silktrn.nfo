 Trainer info: 




 Copy the file SILKTUNT.COM into the directory containing Silk.  Then run it
 if you wish to run the trainer.


 The trainer loader SILKTUNT.COM loads up the game file SILK.EXE.  If you
 renamed it, or have it under a different name, rename it back to SILK.EXE.
 The trainer will notify you of any loading errors.  The trainer passes any
 command line parameters to the game.


 Training info:
 ##############

 During the game, you are timed.  Every 15 seconds or so, a rope holding a
 knife slides down.  You have about 3 minutes to clear the screen, if not
 you're dead.  Now simply press the T key anytime during the game, and the
 knife will restart from the top - as if you just started that level.

 You can press T anytime you feel uncomfortable with the current situation!


 There was a trainer released for this game from Razor, but it doesn't seem
 to work for me, my friend, my friend's friend and my dog... so that's the
 reason for this trainer.  Also, even thou it's got only 1 option, this
 trainer is kinda "interactive".



 Dat's it boiz...l8tz!
