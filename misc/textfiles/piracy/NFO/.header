<P>
In the case of a lot of program collections out there, as well as archives
of any computer-related sort, you will often find little one-page 
advertisements from the Group or BBS that distributed or created the file.
In these small files, the entire essence of a BBS has to be presented and
offered, with a plea or request to join in the fun. In some cases, there
is no BBS to call, just a wish for acknowledgement of the superiority of
that Group or Network. In these short files, you get offered the world.
