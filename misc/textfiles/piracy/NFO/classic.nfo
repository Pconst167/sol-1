  |  Here we go with a little CD-ROM game. Don't start complaining that     |
  |  releasing CD-ROM games is always lame, because it is not. We're not    |
  |  talking about a 70 disk whatever but of a cute 2 disk pinball game.    |
  |  And besides, ever heard of 'to bring the warez to the people'?         |
  |  PS: try typing EARTHQUAKE or EXTRA BALLS before you start a game.      |
  |                                                                         |

  |  We believe that there might be a copy protection in Pinball Mania,     |
  |  yet after playing the game intensely over 3 hours, nothing ever        |
  |  happened indicating a doc check (and that is what it should be).       |
  |  I believe that the chances are EXTREMLY low that it will ever show     |
  |  up. If you encounter any problems (copy protection wise) le me or      |
  |  any other CLASSIC member a note - and WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT :)         |
