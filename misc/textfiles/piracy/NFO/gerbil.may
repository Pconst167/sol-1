II. A Word from Nuts

    A Word from Nuts will not be featured this week because of the conditions
explained in the following area, and that he could think of nothing to say.


III. Cracking Lull

     Now we come to the questions, "Why is the newsletter late?" and "Why the
heck haven't there been many new cracks lately?". The newsletter is late due
to the fact that Nuts was on vacation, and it's a bit difficult to get "A Word
from Nuts" done, when he isn't here. Nuts has been away on vacation, which
accounts for the severe drop in number of cracks. We only have 2 members, and
when one is sick, or goes on vacation, it hurts the group. Nuts however has
returned, and we will begin to release any decent software we see starting
soon. Thank you for the continuing support, and in exchange, we'll try harder
to get more games out faster.


IV. Knights of the Round Table Controversy

    I wondered if the Knights of the Round Table deserved the priviledge of
appearing in this newsletter. I decided they didn't deserve the right to shit
in an indoor toilet, but I did want to address the problem. We're not going
to go around saying "We told you so" about the so-called "group". They've made
fools of themselves without anyone's help. The fact is, if a real group ever
appeared in this area, we would welcome them. We knew however from the start
that this group was a fake, based on certain facts, yet people jumped all over
us going "Give them a chance" and "The Gerbils are afraid of competition".
Sorry, Ladies and Gents, but that isn't the case. When young kids attempt
to make a stab at something they know nothing about, it only hurts everyone.
To any prospective crackers, good luck. If you ever make it to the ranks,
let us know, and we'll get you started. A note to Vernon Reid, the Grim
Reaper, and their fearless leader, Shoeless Joe Jackson:

  Please try and grow up. We assume you were attempting to crack games by
  hex-editing them and looking for the codes. That's what most people do.
  Fellas, it's wrong. That's not the way to go about it. If you're trying
  to crack like Frogger, I suppose it would work, but not with most other
  games.

Other than the above-mentioned, we'd like to apoligize for them, whether or
not they want to. They created temporary hostilities for a few days,
and caused general confusion. This is not right no matter what the case.
We openly invite any of the Knights of the Round Table to submit a statement.
To anyone who wishes to follow in their footsteps and create a false group:
Don't. You don't need to pretend to be something you're not for the sake
of attention. Don't be like them, all they want is attention, be a
contributing user, or a giving Sysop, whichever you are.

Yeah, the above was sort of boring, but it had to be addressed, Thank you.


V. Dear Gerbils:

         I have enjoyed your work since I saw/played a game you guys cracked.
    I would just like to restate my suport for you guys and I hope to see you
    GROW!

         On another side.  I'd like to know how you deside what games you are
    going to buy and eventually crack?  Also, where did you come up with the name
    "The Gerbils".  (do you have a pet?)

    And as always. "Keep Up The Great Work"!

   Dear Pink Floyd:

         We appriciate the support that you, and many others in the area have
   shown toward us. Producing games for the public is something we enjoy doing,
   and we shall continue to do so as long as the conditions are right.

         The way we decide what games we are going to release depends on many
   factors. First of all, we tend to go for the newer games. The main choice
   is basically our taste in games though. If a game looks good, and is made
   by a respectable company, we usually go for those types. As for the name,
   we wanted to shy away from the traditional names, and get words such as
   "death", "doom", "ultra", "techno-cool", "awesomeness", "warriors", etc.
   Nuts has a pet Gerbil named "Techno-Rat", and we agreed "The Gerbils" would
   be a good name for a cracking group. Thank you for your letter, and we
   hope we have answered your questions. Please feel free to inquire with any
   other questions you might have.


VI. Fill-in

    This is a fill in. It means nothing. Something had to go here. Go out to
you local pet store and buy a Gerbil.

  Stacker


VIII. Programmer's Note

     The Gerbils no longer use or endorse "PC-Watch" as the groups main
utility. This program fails to meet an very important criteria, and we
have found a far superior program, which we will not release the name of
due to group security, and the problems it created before.


IX. Questions, Problems, Suggestions

     If you have any questions, problems, or suggestions for us, you should
know where to contact us, but for reasons of security we cannot list all the
boards we're on. You should basically know what we are or aren't on, or you
could ask the Sysop of the board you obtained this file on how to contact
us. Please leave all comments, etc., to us in E-Mail (Private Mail). We are
now accepting comments or editorials from anyone.
