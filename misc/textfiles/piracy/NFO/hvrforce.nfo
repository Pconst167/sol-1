Game info:  The game is a re-make of Resolution 101 by Millenium.  This
 remake of the game features sound for the Adlib / Sound Blaster / and
 Roland. Not a bad remake.  The old game, "Resolution 101" also did not
 get spread very well, so this may be reletively new to most users out
 there. This game desperetly needs docs though, and I'll type them up
 for you this weekend, unless someone does it before me.  Enjoy it.

Jake's Notes:  Ok, this one was not all that hard of a crack just a byte patch
 over the doc check and the conditional jump.  In leiu of past experiences, I
 have traced this one all the way into the code to make sure I was not
 overlooking anything. I haven't but there are a few minor things you may want
 to know. The joystick works fine but after it asks you to move the joystick
 to the lower right hand corner and press a button you must press the second
 fire button even though it doesn't specify this. Also, if it seems like your
 computer is waiting for you to do something (ie: looks frozen) just press the
 space bar and it will go to the next screen. This is not a problem due to the
 crack but is something inherent in the program. Sorry but I don't write them.
 Also, there are NO Tandy graphics contrary to what the file says. They were
 not in the zip file.
