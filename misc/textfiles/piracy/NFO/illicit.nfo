 ﬁ≤     Illicit is a brand new group.  We are not new to the mod scene     ≤
  ±     though.  Most of our current members have come from fSW, who       ±
  ∞     still exist amazingly.  Illicit will provide the best quality
        modding/coding/art/ppe available, with our highly qualified
        members.  This group is not going to release anything which does
        not meet up to standards.  Don't expect humongous releases,
        packed with half-hearted shit.  We are striving for quality and
        not quantity.  Look for us in the next month or two, since we are
        taking a lot of time to organize this group to work as well as it
        can.

      ppe coders, artists, and distro sites/boards.
