   GENERAL NOTES / COMMENTS
 --
 ---
      
  Well this was definately a disappointment of an RPG contrary to
  what Skillion thought of it. Graphics are half decent but gameplay
  could have been much better. Anyway, type EXROCGCE XXXXXX.CHR where
  the X's is the name of your character. If you set the attributes too
  high then it may give you some error message just keep clicking on the
  icon.  This is the best editor to date and naturally its brought to 
  you by EXTINCT. Enjoy dudes!
