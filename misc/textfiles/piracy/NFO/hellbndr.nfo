       By this time, we think we have established our name and          
       established it well. So far all our releases have been           
       of high quality, all new, working,etc. Even a game of            
       the week. You can ban us all you want, but it is just            
       a matter of time before you realize we are doing just            
       as well as those higher groups like PRESTIGE/RAZOR.              
       We dont want any fights. We're here for the friendly             
       competition and fun of the scene. Friends come and go,           
       enemies accumulate....                 -Tklp
