Description
-----------
The year is 1997.  After  20 years of  relative peace in the Middle East,
tensions  are starting to  mount as the ever present fears of re-armament
and  nuclear testings are confirmed.  The  situation is brought to a head
with the assasination of the Israeli Prime Minister on December 29, 1996.
That same day you are sworn into office as leader of Israel.

As  the New  Year begins, you set  out to achieve  your aim: to force the
collapse of neighboring  states while keeping Israel alive and monitoring
the  conflict between  Iran and  Iraq.  Direct military defeat, political
destabilization or  general pressure can all lead to the collapse of your
neighbors - But  remember, World  opinion has  to  remain  favorable  and
Superpowers  persuaded to h elp your  cause.  All the  while the internal 
health  of the Israeli  state has to be maintained as your opponents seek
your downfall.

Review
------
This is a classic, if little know, older title.  It will provide you with
many hours  of gameplay, if you stick with it.  The replayability of this
title is in winning with a VARIETY  of different approaches, from wars to
diplomatic  to insurgency.  And, by the way, we have  won  this  game AND
conquered  all surrounding  countries.  The clue to doing this is timing,
patience and alliances.  If you balance all of these, it CAN be done. You
will find  it very  satisfying to  have an Israeli Middle Eastern Empire.
The  only minus  to this game  is that you can be screwed from the start.
With all of your neighbors aggresively posturing towards you, you have to
hope to overthrow them before they gang up on you...

Strategy
--------

1)  Try and NOT get involved  in two front wars, unless you can overwhelm
    one of the opponents quickly
2)  Keep world  opinion on your side.  It pays to have the US as a friend


That's it...enjoy!  Look for more K-RaD ReTRoWaReZ from Dxmachina...
