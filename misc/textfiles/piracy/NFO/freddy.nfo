Mindscape's
            "Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O' Fun"
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Viper here, typing up this short file for the game, as Blix
has been extremely busy, along with other TCS members, rewriting the software
from the ground up.

	Anyhow, here's another one of those Mindscape Games with a pretty 
simple doc check attached to it.  Fiendish Freddy's is merely no more
than a circus game, with events on The High Dive, the TightRope, the
Human Cannonball, and more.  Real neat special effects, some annoying
music/sound effects, and some excellent graphics make up the game.
Unfortunately, no Adlib support on this one..as Mindscape has not been known
anyway for putting it in their games yet.

	Anyhow, before anybody panics and says that you can't hit the
[Return] key, and tries to blame it on the crack, use the INSERT key
instead as your fire button and everything should go along just great for 
you.

	Can you save the circus?  Good ol' Freddy needs your help, or the
circus shall die..(Believe me, it happened to me several times..)  The game
is not exactly that easy to play!


Special thanks go out to Invisible Stalker for supplying the originals to
this game!

And Other Hello's & Greets to: 

Black Star & the gang at UGC (Hope things are going well for you guys..); 
Sloprs (Blix lost his user list, you weren't deleted off his board...);
and
Jenetic Bytemare (whereever you've gone to...)


Enjoy the Game!
