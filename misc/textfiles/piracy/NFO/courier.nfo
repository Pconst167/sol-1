
                   Public Enemy Bulletin
  
    We need some assistance in spreading the Public Enemy releases around.
If you wish to be a PE Courier please contact either Alexis Machine,
Lazarus Long, or Skoal Bandit on any of the PE Sites near you.  A Public
Enemy Courier is not treated like a 'slave' or 'servent'.  Couriers
receive full access on all the sites along with unlimited file ratios.
Each courier will be responsible for 5 boards on his 'list'.  The list
will be made up of boards that are selected by the courier and Public
Enemy members.  Usually each courier will have a PE site on his list
along with other non-affiliated but good boards.  A Public Enemy Courier
must have a 14,400 Baud USR modem (Dual or HST) and must be loyal.
Besides that everything else can be worked out easily.  A courier
should have the free time neccessary to call the boards on his list at
least once a day (Or whenever a PE release comes out) and he should be 
available by voice call to courier originals from suppliers to crackers.
(That's where the loyal part comes in). 
   Once again, if you wish to be a courier please contact either Alexis
Machine, Lazarus Long, or Skoal Bandit.
   To leave notice of your interest in becoming a courier call these boards.
