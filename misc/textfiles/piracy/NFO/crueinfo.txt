Game: Death Knights of Krynn
By: S.S.I.

Cracked By: Harry Lime
Released: March 9, 1991

Cracking Notes:

    Alright here's the deal... Seems I.N.C. cracked part of it... but they 
missed out the protection that shows up later in the game. We simply nuked
that for you now all you have to due it hit return and it will let you save it.
No problems here it took about 5mins.

    BTW: To whoever did the cracking job for I.N.C. the reason it kept freezing
         was cause you can just NOP out far calls. all you had to do was change
	 the memory info... Hope to see the DOCS on this one soon....Later
