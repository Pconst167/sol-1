    Well, here the DAMN game is after 3 years of waiting. Sorry I can't offer
  complete DOCS right now but it's gonna be an SOB typing them all in.
    You start the game with ULTIMA.COM and follow everything from there. If
  you have never played before, use Initialize a new game. It's pretty much
  like Ultima II and III. I will, however, have full documentation ASAP.
