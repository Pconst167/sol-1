   This is a re-release of the original Cybergenic Ranger I released in    
   1990-91, that will explain the old copyright dates. This version        
   is totally redone with new graphics and sound. You probably don't even  
   remember Cybergenic Ranger I, because no one had the machine to run it  
   at the time it was first released many years ago. But this game kicks   
   ass. It's cracked and trained! Enjoy!                                   
                                                                           
   The textfile CRREF.TXT includes the references, and trainer keys.
