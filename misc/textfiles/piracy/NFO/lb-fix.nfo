  Ú                                                                        ¿
    Gaming Notes: After playing most of Conquest of The Longbow, we have
                  discovered at least the first spot where copy protection
                  exists, and our cracker has put out this fix for it.  
                  As we see it, as long as we are going to put out a game 
                  with copy protection, we should be the first ones to 
                  make the fix for it.

          Notes:  To get around the lore of the gemstones, copy the
                  LB-FIX.EXE file into your \SIERRA\ROBIN directory
                  and run it once.  It then patches the RESOURCE.004
                  file.  In the game, when the monk prompts you to 
                  select the gems, select 3 DIFFERENT gems for each
                  riddle.  This protection is a pain because I had to
                  play deep into the game with no hints or any help!
                  If you find any more protection in this game, please
                  let us know!

        With the big rush of games expected from the Christams Season,
     we are in need of a few good couriers.  If you want to courier for
     us, you will need to be around quite a bit durring the day, and not 
     mind long tedious hours of long distance phone calls.  If you are
     interested, e-mail Suicidal on either The Nemesis(WHQ) or 
     Maximum Security(Courier HQ)

        FCC is always looking for new dist sites and members.  If you 
     have something helpful to offer FCC, then e-mail Nightshade on
     The Nemesis or Minas Morgul aout becoming a member.  If you would 
     like to help out a bit, or have a decent respectable board, then
     e-mail Suicidal on The Nemesis about becoming a dist site.

     Greets:
       USA: Sorry about the .NFO file that was tampered with by 
            Dr. Feelgood.  He has been removed from our group, and 
            we sever any connections from the past and present with 
            him.  And BTW, FCCDox is not meant to be a copy off of
            USA-Dox as you accuse, it is simply a generic name used 
            for docs released by groups.
       BBS'ers:  Just to clear things up, Lord Blix is NOT a FCC 
                 member.  Dr Feelgood and his board, Use Your Illusion
                 are in no way affiliated with FCC.  The .NFO file 
                 created by him is NOT a FCC .NFO, and all info in it
                 is not to be regarded.  The authentic .NFO file for 
                 Conquest of the Longbow is dated 11/26/91 at 10:50am
