Okay, the protection of the game was a self running Boot Disk. Ripping out all
the data to make a Dos Version and adding a Quit to Dos Options took me 20
Mins. To do. And Also, I remove the Access Code on SATAN 2 that you were
getting when you finish Satan 1.Thanks to Irata/RSI for sending the game.

Quick Help to Exit the Game: From the game CONTROL-ESCAPE to go back to the
menu. And From the Menu ESCAPE to go back to Dos. If the programs Hangs,
remove all your Dam TSR's in Memory.
