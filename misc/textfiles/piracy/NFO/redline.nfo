                                CULT of QUARTEX

                              Speed of life, fast.
                 It's like walkin' barefoot over broken glass.
                   It's like, jumpin' rope on a razor blade.
                    All lightning quick decisions are made.
                         Lifestyle plush, females rush.
           The high profile personality, who earns his pay illegally.
                     Professional liar, schoolboys admire.
                  Young girls desire, very few live to retire.
           Cash flow extreme, dress code supreme, vocabulary obscene.
                  Definition - QUARTEX, you know what i mean ?
