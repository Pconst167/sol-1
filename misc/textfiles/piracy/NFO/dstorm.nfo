  Well, it seems that NEUA is reaching an all time low!  This game is really
bad, but when someone purchases it (at a whopping price of 31 bucks) the
company donates some of the money to the Marine College Fund.  YEA!  The
marines should take out this company next.  Oh, by the way...to get the
answers to all the questions, simply type the file QUESTION.FIL.
