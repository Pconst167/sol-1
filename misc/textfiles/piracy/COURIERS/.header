<H1>Piracy Textfiles: Courier Membership Lists and Introductions</H1>
<P>
Of of the more intruiging aspects of the microcomputer piracy subculture has
been the rise of "Courier Groups", which are dedicated to the sole purpose of
transporting pirated games from the groups that pirate to high-traffic web
sites and BBSes, often available with a membership fee. This more shark-like
piracy approach rose in the early 1990s with the PC world, and by the
middle of the decade, it was an established near-industry.
