Crack Info:
             Anyway, here is the info on the crack. Being wary of games with
  multiple doc checks I looked thoroughly at the code containing the first
  doc check. As far as I can tell this section of code is used only once and
  for the sole purpose of asking the required doc check. The conditional jump
  before the check points to the end of the routine and the routine itself is
  not contained in a call which would seem the most feasible way of having
  multiple doc checks since programmers don't like to duplicate code. If for
  some strange act of God there is a second doc check please contact your local
  group member who will relay the message and steps will be taken to correct the
  matter. Remember, we test these as much as possible but you can not expect us
  to play the game for days on end just to see if a second check is present.
 
Hi's and Ho's: Well since I am INC's newest cracker, I am sort of new at
               these Hi's to people, so I will make it short.

  couriers that have ever existed in INC of course.
