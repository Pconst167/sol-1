David Wolf: Secret Agent was supplied by Warlord and Malignant Growth.  INC is
"Releasing" (Not claiming a 'crack') this game. The game is pretty good as far
as graphics are concerned, as it supports VGA 256 mode.  Also supported are:
Adlib, Tandy music, and the Roland card.

Quick information to get you going-
'''
RUNME --------- Asks if you wish to load the installation program, then game.
RUNME INSTALL - Brings up the installation program only.
RUNME SKIP ---- Loads the game; bypasses the GIF displays.
RUNME x ------- Loads the game normally ('x' is anything other than above).

I did not locate a quit option from the game, looks like you must reboot to
exit it.  The joystick responce seemed a bit slower than I expected from a
386 machine, but who knows.  Hitting Escape brings up a menu, use space to
choose an option (during game play).

I don't think there is anything that can go wrong, I've tried it on a VGA/386
and EGA/386 machine.
