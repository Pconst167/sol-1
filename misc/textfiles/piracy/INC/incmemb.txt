 * - Data Detective is a funny story. First we had Patch (Geoff) who cracked
     for INC and MCM. Anyways, he got too busy, so he tought his college
     roommate how to crack. That is Data Detective. His name is A.J. If you
     give him a call always ask for Geoff first, and see if he can do it,
     since he is a bit better, otherwise give it to A.J.

        NEW GROUP POLICY - Enforced 3/8/90

               ATTENTION! All INC Members be aware of this. Line Noise is
        no longer the "President" of the group. Line Noise is a "Group
        Coordinator", as well as Cool Hand, Binary Brain, and Vigilanti.
        NO ONE in the group has authority to remove a member, nor does one
        has the right to let in another member without one of the group
        coordinator's consulted. This is to be unity in the group, and not
        have a monarchy. So if anyone says "Line Noise, I dont like this guy,
        get rid of him." I will say too bad. I cant any longer, and furthermore
        wont.

  To Couriers:

        Your jobs are vital to this group's success. Do a good job, and always
    be ready for something to distribute. Post some INC board numbers once in
    a while when you are get a chance on some boards, and always be positive
    towards INC.


  To ALL: If you have any problems with this newsletter, and feel I missed
          something or need something removed, let any group coordinator know
          and we will do something about it.
