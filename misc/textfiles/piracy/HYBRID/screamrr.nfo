 |    After bringing you Screamer and Screamer 2, Hybrid brings you the best  |
 |    racing game on PC ever - Screamer Rally. If you don't have a 3Dfx       |
 |    accelerator - go get yourself one now. This game is absolutely          |
 |    marvellous with 3Dfx!                                                   |
 |                                                                            |
 |    The original Screamer is quite simply the most exciting and enjoyable   |
 |    driving game available for the PC. At least it was. Now Screamer Rally  |
 |    is racing into the lead with new cars, new tracks and, crucially, even  |
 |    more speed. A new front end, in-built 3Dfx acceleration and improved    |
 |    AI also ensure that Rally gives gamers a more competitive experience    |
 |    every time the green light says go.                                     |
 |                                                                            |
 |    * Real Rallying experience added to the sheer speed of Screamer.        |
 |    * Five teams to pitch your driving skills against.                      |
 |    * Single, championship and time trials races to keep even the best      |
 |      drivers happy, plus a mirror mode to challenge them further.          |
 |    * Seven new tracks: China, Canada, Italy, Arizona, Sweden and Wales.    |
 |      Plus a hidden bonus track.                                            |
 |    * Five new cars                                                         |
 |    * Split screen and network option for up to six players                 |
 |    * A new selection of thumping racing music to drive along too           |
 |    * Compatible with the racing wheel and pedals                           |
 |                                                                            |

 |    Unzip and unrar. Then run setup - setup ur sound, don`t change the      |
 |    3D-FX option, of course. Then Run SR.BAT to start.                      |
 |                                                                            |

 |    We will be doing a HI-RES (Non-3D-FX) add-on for this game - just as    |
 |    soon as Cypher sobers up! :)                                            |

 |    Your`ll notice the CLASS.SUX file in the directory - this is a new      |
 |    feature in a Hybrid release - by deleting this file, your`ll be able    |
 |    to put the game into `CLASS MODE` - Class Mode, being the Setup won`t   |
 |    work, so the game won`t work correctly.                                 |
