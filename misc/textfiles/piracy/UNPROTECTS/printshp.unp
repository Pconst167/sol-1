        Print Shop unprotect procedures

        The  Print  Shop uses an installation process which  records  the 
        physical  location  of the program in an  overlay  file.   During 
        program  initialization, a check is made to see if  the  location 
        has changed.  If it has, due to a restore, a disk reorganization, 
        a  disk  optimization, or anything, the program refuses  to  run.  
        The  code  to do the checking is actually stored in  the  overlay 
        file.    These  procedures  force  the  result  to  be   accepted 
        regardless of whether the check is correct or not.

        1)  Install  the program in the usual way, using the  Print  Shop 
        install programs.

        2)  Copy the files to another directory.

        3)  Uninstall the programs, again using the Print Shop programs.

        4)  Now CD to the directory which has the copied files.

        5)  Use DEBUG to make the following changes:

             -DEBUG PSINIT.OVR             Load the program into DEBUG
             -S0 FFF 59 3B C8 75 1E        This is a version check.
             xxxx:024A                     If you don't get this number,
                                                STOP NOW.  Wrong version!
             -e24d 90 90                   NOP out an instruction
             -s0 fff 30 e8 13 df 85 co 74 29
             xxxx:0265                     If you don't get this number,
                                                STOP NOW.  Wrong version!
             -e26b eb                      Change a conditional jump to
                                                unconditional.
             -w                            Write the file back
             -q                            Quit DEBUG

        The  Print  Shop program will now run from any directory  on  any 
        disk.
