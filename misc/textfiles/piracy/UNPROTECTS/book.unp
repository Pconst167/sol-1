HOW TO UNPROTECT "LITTLE BLACK BOOK" by CIGNET TECHNOLOGIES.


1. First, make a copy of the original distribution disk. NEVER fool
   around with the original disk--it's much too dangerous!

2. Using the COPY and a "disk zapper" such as the Norton Utilities,
   search the file BOOK.EXE for the following byte string:

              3D 00 00 74 07 C6 06 03 01

Change it to:

              B8 00 00 74 07 C6 06 03 00

Next, search the BOOK.EXE file for:

              CD 13 B8 01 02 CD 13 72 0E

and change it to:

              90 90 90 90 90 90 90 EB 0E

Finally, search for:

              EB F5 F6 C4 06 75 06

and change it to:

              EB F5 F6 C4 06 EB 06

This completes the changes to BOOK.EXE.

Next, search the file LBB.EXE for the following byte string:

              3D 00 00 74 07 C6 06 76 04 01

Change it to:

              B8 00 00 74 07 C6 06 76 04 00

Next, search the LBB.EXE file for:

              CD 13 B8 01 02 CD 13 72 0E

and change it to:

              90 90 90 90 90 90 90 EB 0E

Finally, search for:

              EB F5 F6 C4 06 75 06

and change it to:

              EB F5 F6 C4 06 EB 06

This completes the changes to LBB.EXE.

LITTLE BLACK BOOK is now fully unprotected!
