HOW TO UNPROTECT "ARTWORK" by West End Film (version 2.43)

(1) First, make a copy of the original disk. NEVER, EVER, fool around
with your only working copy of a program!!!

(2) This will take repeated searches with a disk zapper such as Norton.
Search the file ARTWORK.EXE. Note that all bytes are in hexadecimal.

    A. Search for the byte string: A0 A2 19 30 E4. Change it to:
                                   B8 61 00 30 E4

->  This forces ARTWORK to see the letter "a" of its signature, even if
    no "a" is there...

    B. Search for the byte string: 80 FC 10 1F 58 75 03. Change to:
                                   80 FC 10 1F 58 90 90

->  This causes ARTWORK to believe that the expected diskette error has
    occurred, even if it hasn't.

    C. Search for the byte string: B4 3D CD 21 73 03. Change to:
                                   B8 02 00 90 90 90

->  This prevents a diskette check.


    D. Search for the byte string: 8B 46 0A E8 7C 00. Change to:
                                   8B 46 0A 90 90 90

->  This prevents one of the two accesses of the copy-protect tracks.

    E. Search for the byte string: 8B 46 0A E8 1A 00. Change to:
                                   8B 46 0A 90 90 90

->  This prevents the second access of the copy-protect tracks.


    F. Search for the byte string: 72 02 33 C0 C3. Change to:
                                   90 90 33 C0 C3

This completes the first part of the unprotect.  Using DEBUG.EXE, load
the ORIGINAL copy of ARTWORK.EXE. Put the original diskette in
A:.

    D. At the "dash" prompt, type: G 8bd:9AA <cr>
                                   G 9b1     <cr>
                                   G 8bd:9aa <cr>
                                   G 9b1     <cr>

-> This sequence has caused ARTWORK to read in a signature from the
   protected tracks of the original disk. Type: D DS:xxxx (where xxxx is
   the current contents of the BX register)

WRITE DOWN THE BYTE PATTERN DISPLAYED!

On my copy, the pattern is: 4B 61 78 78 00 00    (=Kaxx)

The "4B" is the signature of the graphics board which ARTWORK expects to
see. The "61" is the letter "a", which says "I am a valid ARTWORK". This
signature is for the Tecmar Graphics Master. If your copy was installed
for a different board, the bytes given above will differ from yours.

Remove the original disk from drive A:.

Now quit DEBUG and return to Norton or some other disk utility.

Search the modified copy of ARTWORK.EXE (NOT the original) for the byte
             string: A0 A1 19 30 E4  and change it to:
                     B0 xx 90 30 E4

The "xx" above stands for whatever the byte was in the signature string
you wrote down. For me, xx was "4B". ARTWORK is now unprotected. Have
fun, kids!
