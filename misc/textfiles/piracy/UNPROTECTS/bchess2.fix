BATTLE CHESS 2 FIX

Just replace the original file with the file included with this fix and
there will be no more copy protection.  When a question is asked, just hit
enter and you will be in the program.  This is true when you run setup.exe.
It will also work is asked during the game (although this should not happen
once you set up your game.  It will only ask you when you save your setup.
