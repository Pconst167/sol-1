Ok, here's how to blow away the "look up" crap in Caveman Ugh-Lympics.

Only the Norton Utils method will be shown, if you don't have Norton then 

GET IT or have a Hacker friend use debug on it.

In SOS.EXE, Using Norton, search for: 76 01 E8 BB 48 9A

Replace E8 BB 48 with 90 90 90 

Write the changed data and your done! No more look up screen!
