MEMSHIFT.UNP
============


In the spirit of a recent patch to unprotect LOTUS 1-2-3, I discovered
the same logic can be applied to unprotect MEMORY/SHIFT.

1. Rename MS.EXE MS.XYZ
2. DEBUG MS.XYZ
3. type  U 1565
4. you should see    INT 21   at that address
5. type  E 1565 90 90
   type  E 1567 90 90
6. type  W
7. type  Q
8. Rename MS.XYZ MS.EXE

Finally, make sure command.com resides on the disk where MEMORY/
SHIFT  is initiated.
