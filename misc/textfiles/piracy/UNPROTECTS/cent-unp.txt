Ok, here is what you need to know in order to break the protection on Centurion by Electronic Arts.

Using Debug: (type what is between quotes)


"Debug ovl0.ovl"
-"s 0000 ffff c0 75 06 ff 46"
xxxx:615
"e 616"
xxxx:616: 74."75"
-"w"
-"q"

That's it.  Simple huh?  Just changing a Jump Not Zero to Jump Zero.  So answer the silly question any old way you like.
