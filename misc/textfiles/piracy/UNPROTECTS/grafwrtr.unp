      DATED : OCT 19,1984 (FIRST RELEASE)


ORIGINALLY SUBMITTED TO ASA FULTONS BBS (THE SHINING SUN -305-273-0020)
                 AND TO
                        LEE NELSONS BBS (PC-FORUM        -404-761-3635)

PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE UNPROTECT PROCEDURES INVOLVE FROM 4 HOURS TO
___________________________________________________________________

40 OR MORE HOURS ( 8+ HOURS FOR 'GRAPHWRITER' ) OF

SINGLE STEPPING THRU CODE AND FIGURING OUT THE

INTENT OF THE ORIGINAL CODE.. SO I WOULD APPRECIATE IT WHEN U PASS

THIS ON TO OTHER BOARDS YOU DO NOT ALTER THIS OR TRY TO TAKE CREDIT

FOR MY LOST SLEEP.... THE A.S.P... (J.P. TO HIS FRIENDS)


OH, AS A FURTHER NOTE. I SEE SOME BBS'S ARE NOW CHARGING U TO BE REGISTERED
TO USE THEIR SYSTEM. FIRST OF ALL I GIVE U FROM 4 TO 60 HOURS OF MY TIME
AT NO COST TO YOU AND I DO NOT LOOK TO KINDLY TO SUCH BBS'S PUTTING ON
MY PROCEDURES AND THEN CHARGING U TO GET ACCESS TO THEM. THEY DIDNT SPEND
TIME AND COST (SAY 'X' HOURS * $40+) TO MAKE THE PROCEDURES AVAIL. , SO
I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT SUCH BOARDS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE 'A.S.P'S'
PROCEDURES, UNLESS THEY ARE WILLING TO PUT THEIR WORKS TRULY IN THE
PUBLIC DOMAIN.. ENOUGH SAID.. THANK YOU.

3). SOMEONE WANTED TO KNOW WHY I USED UPPER CASE FOR EVERYTHING. FIRST
   AFTER ABOUT 8 TO 20 HOURS OF STARING AT THE TUBE., I AM NOT ABOUT
   TO SHIFT THE CHARACTERS, AND SECONDLY I AM SO EXCITED , AFTER DOING
   SOMETHING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE, AND IN A HURRY TO GET IT OUT
   ON A BBS, SO THAT U MAY USE THE NEWLY GLEAMED KNOWLEDGE.
