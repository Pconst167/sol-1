HOW TO UNPROTECT "BRUSHWORK" by West End Film (version 2.43)

(1) First, make a copy of the original disk. NEVER, EVER, fool around
with your only working copy of a program!!!

(2) This will take repeated searches with a disk zapper such as Norton.
Search the file PAINT.EXE. Note that all bytes are in hexadecimal.

    A. Search for the byte string: A0 83 15 30 E4. Change it to:
                                   B8 62 00 30 E4

->  This forces PAINT to see the letter "b" of its signature, even if
    no "b" is there...

    B. Search for the byte string: 80 FC 10 1F 58 75 03. Change to:
                                   80 FC 10 1F 58 90 90

->  This causes PAINT to believe that the expected diskette error has
    occurred, even if it hasn't.

    C. Search for the byte string: B4 3D CD 21 73 03. Change to:
                                   B8 02 00 90 90 90

->  This prevents a diskette check.


    D. Search for the byte string: 9C 0E E8 17 00. Change to:
                                   9C 0E 90 90 90

->  This prevents one of the two accesses of the copy-protect tracks.

    E. Search for the byte string: 9C 0E E8 03 00. Change to:
                                   9C 0E 90 90 90

->  This prevents the second access of the copy-protect tracks.


    F. Search for the byte string: 72 02 33 C0 C3. Change to:
                                   90 90 33 C0 C3


    G. Search for the byte string: 3B 06 F9 10 74 1E and change it to:
                                   3B 06 F9 10 EB 1E

-> This makes PAINT think that it has seen the proper graphics board
   signature byte.


BRUSHWORK is now unprotected. Have fun, kids!
