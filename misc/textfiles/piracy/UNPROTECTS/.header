<H1>Piracy Textfiles: Unprotects</H1>
<P>
The raging debate aside, in these files you find instructions on how to 
unprotect various pieces of software so they could be copied freely. In
some cases, the attempt is to make it so the program can be run
on a hard drive instead of the 256kb floppy that came with the software.
In others, people try to make it easier to install among multiple machines
or make a needed backup copy of programs that cost them hundreds of dollars.
<P>
An interesting subtext is the myriad ways that are used to prevent copying
the software. A battle still being waged.
