 IMPORTANT!  COPY FILE.EXE AND/OR REPORT.EXE TO ANOTHER DISK FIRST.
 DON'T MAKE THESE PATCHES ON YOUR ORIGINAL DISK! (USE THE USUAL DOS
 COPY COMMAND)

FOR PFS-FILE:
  RENAME FILE.EXE TO FILE.ZAP
  HAVE DEBUG.COM HANDY
  TYPE -> DEBUG FILE.ZAP
  TYPE -> U 9243
  YOU SHOULD SEE, AMONG OTHER THINGS:  PUSH BP
                                       MOV AX,DS
                                       MOV ES,AX
                                 (ETC)
  IF YOU DON'T SEE THIS, TYPE -> Q  (YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT VERSION)
  OTHERWISE,
  TYPE -> E 9248 EB 2B
  TYPE -> W
  TYPE -> Q
  BACK IN DOS, RENAME FILE.ZAP TO FILE.EXE.  YOU NOW HAVE AN UNPROTECTED
  COPY OF PFS-FILE.


FOR PFS-REPORT:
  RENAME REPORT.EXE TO REPORT.ZAP
  HAVE DEBUG.COM HANDY, AND TYPE -> DEBUG REPORT.ZAP
  TYPE -> U 98BF
  YOU SHOULD SEE, AMONG OTHER THINGS:  PUSH BP
                                       MOV AX,DS
                                       MOV ES,AX
                                 (ETC)
  IF YOU DON'T SEE THIS, TYPE -> Q  (YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT VERSION)
  OTHERWISE,
  TYPE -> E 98C4 EB 2B
  TYPE -> W
  TYPE -> Q
  BACK IN DOS, RENAME REPORT.ZAP TO REPORT.EXE.  YOU NOW HAVE AN
  UNPROTECTED COPY OF PFS-REPORT.

For PFS-Write:

 RENAME PFSWRITE.EXE TO PFSWRITE.ZAP
 DEBUG PFSWRITE.ZAP
 U 235A
 YOU SHOULD SEE, AMONG OTHER THINGS:  INT 13
                                      JNB 2362

 IF YOU DON`T SEE THIS, TYPE -> Q (you don't have the right version)
 OTHERWISE,
 TYPE -> E235A 90 90 90 90
 TYPE -> E2360 90 90
 TYPE -> A2369
 TYPE -> CMP AX,AX
 TYPE -> <cr>
 TYPE -> W
 TYPE -> Q

 RENAME PFSWRITE.ZAP TO PFSWRITE.EXE.  YOU NOW HAVE AN UNPROTECTED COPY
 OF PFS-WRITE.

 P.S. From another author than the one who wrote the above.
      The routine above is excellent, however I had a different version
      of PFS FILE and PFS REPORT.  If you dont find the locations listed
      above try these:

 PFS FILE   TYPE -> U 9223  YOU SHOULD SEE  PUSH BP
                                            MOV AX,DS
                                            MOV ES,AX
                                      (ETC)
 IF SO TYPE -> E 9228 EB 2B
       TYPE -> W
       TYPE -> Q
 AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN ABOVE ABOUT RENAME ETC.

 PFS REPORT  TYPE -> U 988F  YOU SHOULD SEE PUSH BP
                                            MOV AX,DS
                                            MOV ES,AX
                                      (ETC)
 IF SO TYPE -> E 9894 EB 2B
       TYPE -> W
       TYPE -> Q
 AND FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN ABOVE ABOUT RENAME & ETC.

 My thanks to the original author who worked so hard to help us.
 Please use these routines for your own use. I needed to add DOS 2.1
 and place these programs on double sided disks.  Don't rip off these
 software manufacturers.
