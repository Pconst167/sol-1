Here is the "ENGLISH" version of the Symphony Unprotect procedure:
 
1. Rename the program
      REN SYMPHONY.CMP SYMPHONY.XXX

2. Type  DEBUG SYMPHONY.XXX

3. After the - prompt appears, type   R       and press Enter

   Look at the value displayed for the DS register (left hand, second line)
   Whatever the value is, add 1000 to it. For example, if the DS contains
   05DF, add 1000 to make it 15DF. I will refer to this new value as yyyy
   in the next step.

4. Type  E yyyy:3A05 75      press Enter

5. Type  W                   press Enter

6. Type  Q                   press Enter

7. Rename the program back to the original name

   REN SYMPHONY.XXX SYMPHONY.CMP


Now, BEFORE you run the SYMPHONY program, run the program in this Library
call SYMPH.COM. This need only be run ONCE after each boot. If you want,
you may place it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. It uses Interrupt 75H which
should not conflict with other programs (NOTE.. this may not be true on the
3270PC).

After running SYMPH.COM, you may run your patched version of SYMPHONY 
without the need for the master diskette.

The other files in this library are:

The original unprotection scheme which required you to assemble a  program.
The assembler SYMPH.COM.

Good Luck.
