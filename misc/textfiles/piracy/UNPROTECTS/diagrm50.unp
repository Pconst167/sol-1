UNPROTECT DIAGRAM MASTER V5.0


If you, like myself paid out your hard earned cash for
diagram master only to find out it's install to hard disk
will not work on any drive but C: (contrary to what their
support staff says),  Follow the following procedure and
remove the silly copy protect altogether:

Make a copy of DM.EXE
rename it to DM.XXX
use debug
DEBUG DM.XXX
-d cs:3FC7
    you should see the following:
75 68 ...     if not then you've got a different version than 5.0
              and this won't work.
              If you see 75 68, then
-e cs:3FC7 eb 68
-w
-q
RENAME DM.XXX DM.EXE

You now have a copy of Diagram Master without the copy protect.

After arguing with the Stupid freaks about the fact that some
people have a hard disk with other than a C: designation,
I finally gave up and spent about 3 hours tracing the code and
fixed the problem myself.

Happy Sign Making,
The Freebie Fixer
