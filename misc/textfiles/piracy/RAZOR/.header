<H1>.NFO and Information Files from Razor 1911</H1>
<P>
Razor 1911 is one of the oldest, and probably the longest-living pirating,
demo, and couriering groups in the history of software piracy. Along their
more than 15 year history (they were founded in 1985) they have produced 
demos and pirated games for the Commodore 64, Amiga, and Intel PC, and 
through a near rototiller-like churning of members, have been able to
stay current with advances in technology, including changing platforms,
the CD-ROM revolution, and the Internet. 
<P>
A lot of the important details about Razor 1911 can be found in their
<A HREF="rzrhistory">Official History File</A>, which is located in the
middle of this directory. It was written by founding member Sector 9,
spans over 13 years of the group's existence, and provides a much better
sense of where this group came from and how they conducted themselves.
Spectacular.
