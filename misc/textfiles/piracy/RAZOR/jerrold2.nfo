                        THE HUNTER-BRICK -JERROLD TURN ON"
                        ==================================

THE HUNTER-BRICK, will turn any Jerrold descrambler on in full service test
mode!  The only exception at this time is the new "CFT2200", all others it
works on beautifully!  We are presently working on a modification to
THE HUNTER-BRICK which will allow it to work on the CFT2200's.  Don't confuse
CFT2200 with any other model number (eg: CFT2014 etc) as it is a very special
model number only found in a few areas.

If you wish to turn a Jerrold on in full service test mode, put
THE HUNTER-BRICK in line with your descrambler.  Press the button for
3 seconds, and instantly your descrambler is turned on in full service
test mode!  You may now test pay-tv, and pay-per-view signals!  Once
THE HUNTER-BRICK is removed, your descrambler will return to it's original
state, without any permanent modifications!

It's foolproof, and easy to use!  It also will turn on as many descramblers
as it finds on the cable line!  You can turn on many descramblers at once!

Here is an amazing feature of THE HUNTER-BRICK...it has NO POWER SUPPLY!
It works from any 9volt battery or 9volt battery wall adapter!  This means
it will work in any country of the world, regardless of the electricity
differences!
