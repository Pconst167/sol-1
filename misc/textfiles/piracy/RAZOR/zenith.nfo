			ZENITH CABLE DESCRAMBLERS
			=========================

These Zenith descramblers will replace any and all Zenith ST-xxxx
descramblers!  They will not work on Zenith PZ, PM, or PD model numbers.
If you need descramblers for this system, we will have some available in
the very near future...they will be called the HUNTER-3 descrambler!

If you are interested in more information on these units, please reply
promptly.  We would like to have distributors set up very shortly, so if
you are interested in larger quantity orders, we would be glad to negotiate
a quantity price with you!

All Converter/Descrambler units, come with BRAND NEW remote controls!
All units have new power supplies, and have been tested!  All power
supplies have been rebuilt, wether they need it or not, so these units
should easily last 4-6 years without problems.

All units have "288" CPU processors in them!  NO OLD "165" JUNK!
Every "288" and "165" scrambling mode is enabled, so these will work
everywhere!
