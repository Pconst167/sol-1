  
  This is a newspaper article on The Grim Reaper and The NotSoHumble Babe's
bust. As you will see, the cops aren't too free with all the details,
but you will notice those T-files going around are quite acurate about the
value of the equipment that was carded. 
  
  I find it funny that they called the UnHumble Bitch a man, notice in the 
article below it doesn't mention any females, but the "man's apartment" they 
went to was hers. 
  
  This article is also another good example of how uneducated the Feds and
Media are as to what the modem scene is all about. They have a bad habbit
of making  uneducated assumptions. The modem community has before been
labeled as a ring of criminals to undermine the government. Jesus, they 
watch too much television.

 I am still in the process of getting more details about this
operation, and the on-going investigation of the whole scene. In the
article, they might have said they only had 36 hours to bring the bust
into effect, but they left out quite a bit. Mike and Amy had been watched 
for a lot longer time then that. Anyway, refer to the original farewell
article I wrote, for details, I don't want to make this another 20k file.
Take it easy...

AUTHORITIES CRACK NATIONAL COMPUTER FRAUD RING

In a continuous 36-hour investigation, Farmington Hills Police, U.S.
Secret Service and Michigan State Police cracked what is believed to be a
nationwide computer fraud ring operating from Farmington Hills and involving
men from Livonia, Canton, Plymouth.

Farmington Hills police briefly detained the five men, who they say agreed
Thursday to cooperate with the investigation.

Oakland County and federal prosecutors are reviewing the case to determine
what charges will be filed against the five men - two from Livonia, one form
Farmington Hills, one from Plymouth and one from Canton, said Farmington Hills
Det. Sgt. Charles Nebus.

The five men were not identified pending arrest and arraignment.

"They are computer hackers," said Farmington Hills Det. Patrick Monti.  "They
have a high level of expertise in computers."

Members of the alleged fraud ring apparently gained access to computers of
credit reporting companies and used information, such as credit card numbers,
credit limit, card balance, and card holder names, to order computer
equipment, Monti said.

Purchases of computer equipment were billed to people who had no idea their
credit card numbers and information were being used to place the orders, Monti
said.

The 36-hour investigation began early Wednesday, Jan. 29, with a telephone
call to Farmington Hills police from a computer company with offices in Hawaii
and Texas.

Company officials told police they believed they had a fraudulent order that
led to Farmington Hills.

Police got in touch with Federal Express in Novi where packages where expected
to arrive.  Dectectives Monti, Tim Swanson and David Loe conducted
surveillance of the area. They saw three men in three cars arrive to pick up
packages from the computer company, Monti said.

Detectives followed the men to a Farmington Hills apartment where a fourth man
was waiting. "At that time we confronted the occupants of the apartment.  And
they agreed to cooperate with us." Monti said.

Police surveillance continued to Meijer Thrifty Acres at Eight Mile and
Haggerty roads, Northville Township, where the Canton man - considered to be
the brains behind the operation - retrieved the packages, Nebus said.

"It was a ring of people with the man in Canton as the main actor.  He placed
the orders and others delivered the packages to him."

Police recovered packages, valued at about $20,000, ordered by the ring.

Forfeiture proceedings are expected to intitiated on equipment owned by one of
the men in the ring.  The other packages of computers will be returned to the
companies from which they were ordered, Monti said.

"We determined all the packages we picked up were fraudulent," Monti added.
"When they would go to Federal Express they would sign the name of the person
(whose credit card numbers they used) for the packages.

Farmington Hills police, Secret Service officers and the Michigan State
Police searched the Canton man's house Thursday.

"The Canton man placed the orders and advised a Farmington Hills man to go to
Federal Express in Novi and pick up the packages," Monti said. "It is our
belief they were selling the computers."

The ring would make use of what is called a "bulletin board," which is
computer information available throughout the country.  While using the
bulletin board is not illegal, the information ring members used is, Monti
said.

"The detectives did an outstanding job," Nebus said. "From the time the
information came in, these guys really had to scramble. I credit them with
doing an excellent job on surveillance."

Nebus also credited Federal Express. "We really depend on them a lot.  They're
good folks to work with."
