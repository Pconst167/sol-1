                  -  Released 20 July 1994 -                    


     TODAYS TOPIC :

        The reason why losers are having such an easy time
        spreading viruses on 'elite' bulletin boards...   

                          or...

        How Amiga operated pirate bulletin boards are killing
        the IBM warez scene by allowing viruses to spread cuz
        they are totally unable to do even the simplest virus
        check on inbound files...
     

     PRELUDE  :
     
     Here we are into the third week of July and losers have gone nutz 
     shipping out viruses and fake files all over the place.  I guess 
     it was a boring week and these losers could not find any flies to
     pull the wings off.  As I sat in the comfort of my evil computing
     room a light suddenly went on in my head - I finally realized how
     these losers were able to get their damn virus laiden programs all
     over the world without anyone catching onto to their bogus files.
    

     MANIFESTO BEGINS :

     Look at the scene today and you will find that there are two main
     groups of pirate bulletin boards running in the top of their class
     worldwide.   

     On one hand you have the sysops who are running IBM computers and
     using PCBoard, PCExpress or some lame Forum hack. 

     On the other hand you have sysops who are running AMIGA computers
     and using AmiExpress, Infinity, Tempest or other PCBoard style clones.
     
     The biggest difference between the two groups is that shitty Amiga 
     BBS's that are handling IBM warez CANNOT TEST FOR VIRUS !!!  They
     simply do not have the capability.   This means that I could send my
     entire collection of viruses to an AMIGA run bulletin board and the
     damn thing would let everyone of those virii onto its downloading 
     list.
 
     Now I know right away you will jump in and say that there are a great
     number of IBM systems that are not running virus checkers either.. but
     the point is not important.   What is important is that some of the 
     worlds fastest and biggest pirate systems are running on AMIGA's.  

     At this point I have to ask myself a simple question - what the fuck
     are IBM computer owners doing entrusting the fate of their computer
     and hard drives to sysops who run Amiga bulletin boards ?   

     I took a look at the top uploaders on some of these AmiExpress bulletin
     boards and was not surprised to find that most of the top uploaders of
     IBM pirate warez owned PC'S.   After all, why would an Amiga dude use
     his computer to spread warez for another computer platform.   

     So what is the psychology here.  Why are the worlds best uploaders 
     spreading their zero minute files onto bulletin boards that obviously
     are not able to check the files out for  viruses.  Are we so desperate
     for elite sites that we blindly upload to Amiga bulletin boards and 
     take files from them - never knowing what the hell we just downloaded
     might contain ?
 
     Let us face reality for a second - true world class file spreaders do
     not have time to sit and check out every file they just downloaded off
     these major elite sites.   World class spreaders grab the files and run
     them as fast as they can move em.  It is only after some poor dolt sits
     and actually runs the damn thing that it is found out that it destroys
     hard drives.   Than the poor courier has to run like crazy to have the
     file nuked off the sites he sent it to - or else his reputation goes
     down the toilet.

     I am beginning to think that we are gluttons for punishment.  I am 
     beginning to think that we enjoy downloading files that are later
     found to have nasty viruses and trojans on them.  Maybe we are 
     a bunch of phucking suicidal lemmings.  Maybe we should open our eyes
     and see how our own poor spreading practices are injuring the scene
     to the point where no one trust any zero day warez anymore.

     I know in our own local scene that over half the 'experienced' users
     will not download any zero minute files off an Amiga operated BBS.
     Instead they wait two or three days for fatality reports to come 
     pouring in - why waste credits or your hard drive to a potential 
     virus - let some other sucker take the chance is their motto...

     So what is the answer.  Well it is one that is not going to make many
     friends on some of the elite systems that are using the Amiga and 
     AmiExpress.   I say boycott them.  If your IBM than take your business
     to a BBS that is running IBM.  Why should IBM owners prop up and support
     bulletin boards that cannot protect IBM computer owners.  

     Or think of it this way - Amiga owners have always held their nose when
     talking about the IBM.   To them the IBM is equal to the anti-god or
     worse - equal to wearing clean underpants.

     Now I know it is a horrible thing to propose but we must face the reality
     of the times we are living in.  Viruses are becoming too common place on
     these Amiga operated bulletin boards.  They cannot to do the simplest of
     virii testing.   So taking files off an Amiga operated BBS is something
     like phucking every drunk girl in a bar.  You know your are going to get
     burned because there is absolutely no protection against nasty things.

     But let me give you another valid reason to begin the exodus from using
     Amiga bulletin boards and start using IBM operated bulletin boards - and
     that is the fact of 'continuity'    As everyone is aware at this point, 
     Commodore computers went tits up.  They are history and their future has
     been brought to an abrupt end by the collapse of the company that once
     fathered the C64.  This means that hardware and future developments for
     that computer died along with the death of the company.
 
     Sysops who are running their bulletin boards on Amiga computers are facing
     a short and bleak future.  As their machines fuck up and die they will not
     be able to go to the corner store to purchase new parts - or even a new
     motherboard.   When Amiga bulletin boards die their death is not for days
     but for weeks or months at a time as they scramble to find parts to fix
     whatever has broken.  

     So let us look at this from a purely greedy perspective - I upload an 
     average of 500 megs to any of the major sites that I am on.  I seldom
     download anywhere near the amount of files that I send there.   I like
     to know that those massive credits I have placed on a BBS will be there
     for quite some time.   Someday I just might want to take a break and
     enjoy downloading like a glutton for a while.   What am I going to do 
     when all these Amiga boards die and take my credits with them.  Lose em.

     Like all good elites I select the boards I do business with based on the
     confidence that the board I am uploading to will be in existence for many
     years into the future.  We simply choose to send our files to boards that
     have been around the longest time and have the best prospect for a long
     and happy future.  No one likes having to keep changing boards every month
     just because Johnny Sysop got married and his wife doesn't like computers
     or some dweeb sysop gave up cuz he got spooked by threats of cops etc.
 
     So at this particular point in history I look out on the pirate world and
     I see the end of the AMIGA operated pirate bulletin boards coming quickly.

     Their demise is assured simply because they fail to provide IBM owners
     with the level of protection that we need - so that we can avoid
     downloading and spreading virus laiden programs that slipped by the
     Amiga run bulletin board's file checker. 

     I know this Manifesto will annoy many of my favorite sysops who run some
     of the worlds greatest pirate sites on Amiga computers and AmiExpress
     BBS software.   But at some point the truth has to come out and be slapped
     in some peoples face.   Normally we are all so busy spreading the latest
     and greatest warez that we don't take time to sit back, look at the scene,
     and see where it is going.  Maybe that is the problem with the elite sites
     that are running Amiga computers for their BBS.  They fail to see how times
     are changing and that their demise is assured if they don't keep in step 
     with the specialized needs of their IBM pirate members.
 
     On the other hand, I am certain that a great number of sysops who run IBMs
     with IBM bulletin board software will nod in agreement with me.

     On the other hand, I am certain that a great number of elites who have 
     downloaded virus infested programs off Amiga operated bulletin boards will
     agree with me.

     On the otherhand, I am certain that a great number of IBM owners who have
     been phucked by viruses found on files that were originally uploaded to
     Amiga bulletin boards will agree the time has come to remove the Amiga
     bulletin boards from the IBM warez distribution chain.

     I guess the only ones who would disagree with this are people who run
     bulletin boards on Amigas - or people who need those Amiga bulletin boards
     to upload their virus infested files to.

     CONCLUSIONS  :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     For elite spreaders :   
                             Start finding IBM operated bulletin boards to 
     take your calls to.  There are plenty of excellent PCBoard BBS's out
     there and you will have no problem adapting from AmiExpress commands
     to PCBoard - after all, Mike Thomas, the original author of AmiExpress
     built his BBS software to look and feel like PC Board.  In particular
     you should look for bulletin boards that do more than a simple check
     on the CRC integrity of your uploads.  If the board does not check
     for viruses than you are defeating the whole purpose of moving away
     from the Amiga operated bulletin boards.  Find a board that takes 
     virus testing seriously.

    
     For Amiga sysops    :   
                              You must recognize that your time is drawing
     near and that your computer is now in serious jeopardy of failing with
     no chance of getting replacement parts in the future.  Seriously consider
     ditching that CPU and buying an IBM.   You will be able to use your 
     hard drives and modems on the new IBM computer so your cash outlay will
     be nowhere as severe as that facing some new sysop trying to match your
     size and speed.   The Amiga warez scene is dead.  Spreading demos and 
     music shit is not piracy - you are simply becoming lame Amiga PD boards
     with Elite IBM warez on them.   Take the hint and make the change.

     For Pirate Groups   :   
                              Aren't you getting just a little tired of seeing
     bogus releases coming out for your groups that have viruses in them.  Do
     you think that by appointing Amiga operated bulletin boards as your WHQ,
     USHQ, or EHQ you are doing yourself or anyone else a favour.   Think about
     it for a moment - if you are suppose to be such mega phucking elite IBM
     pirates,  than why the hell are you letting Amiga computers serve as your
     world class sites.   The time has come for your seniors to seriously look
     at all your sites and migrate over to IBM operated bulletin boards.  Those
     IBM groups that do not migrate onto IBM operated bulletin boards are about
     as stupid as General Motor's employees driving Russian build Ladas.  If 
     you are truly IBM elite pirates - than start acting like it - use IBM
     operated bulletin boards to handle your HQ's.  I find there is nothing
     funnier than a group that boast of being the most elite for IBM using
     an Amiga operated bulletin board for their HQ.  Shit, why not go all the
     way and use a C64 bulletin board - it makes about as much sense.  Just be
     sure that the HQ boards you select to represent your group have the best
     and most intensive virus checkers running against every shit file that
     is uploaded to them.  Than at least you can sleep assured that you have
     done everything possible to cut down on viruses being slipped onto fake
     releases of your warez.

     For Courier Groups  :   
                             Why are you wasting your time spreading files onto
     any Amiga operated bulletin boards.  Should we really be propping up those
     boards and giving them a reason for continued existence or should we force
     those sysops to get in tune with the world and buy IBM and run IBM.  The
     shit files you are picking up off those Amiga bulletin boards are a
     reflection on your groups when you slap your advertisement onto them. How
     do you feel each time the files you spread are later reported to be full
     of viruses and you get the blame.   Think about it and you will realize
     that most of those virus loaded files came from Amiga operated pirate 
     boards that had no method to detect IBM viruses when they were first
     uploaded to them.   If you take files only off IBM systems that do an
     intensive virus check your spreading will be a lot more productive because
     you will know that the files you are moving are clean !  Make your HQ 
     boards IBM only - and with intensive virus testing at that !



     For Losers who like to infect IBM files  :   
                                                Keep laughing and having fun
     with your childish games.  Your work is only helping to prove that the 
     time has come for the IBM pirates to distance themselves from Amiga 
     operated pirate boards.  The more you load viruses onto those Amiga 
     bulletin boards the quicker the  IBM pirate community will see that
     this Manifesto is correct.   As I don't expect all the little lame
     assholes who write viruses to retire or drop dead suddenly, I expect the
     words of this Manifesto will become truer every day. I feel sorry  for
     the type of dweeb who sits around thinking he is clever at phucking up
     peoples hard drives or damaging the reputation of world class pirate
     groups.  The only good news is that such losers do not tend to last 
     long on the scene and move onto other interesting hobbies like 
     collecting dog turds and sniffing bike seats.
     

         


                          
                                    Yours truly
                                    
                                      - TC -
                                      
                ( you know i never give away my handle in these things )
                

       If you want to reach me to give me some feedback, than look for 
       me on Assasin's Guild.  It seems the sysop on Mirage became a
       little upset about an incident involving his private kiddies
       porno conference and copies of those file listings being spread
       around.  All I can say is that it was not me - I don't care if
       you are into buggering chickens or pounding your flesh into your
       palms at night...  I did not spread that file list or the user 
       list for that conference - although I would have if I had got
       it first.
