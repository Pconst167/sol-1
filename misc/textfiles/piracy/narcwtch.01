        NARCS OF THE WEEK: MISTER MUFF AND DARK PROPHET OF CIA

 About a week or two ago, I refused to op MistaMuff on IRC. That single
denial of IRC channel operator status led to a tangled web of malicious
deeds on the part of both him and his cohort, the Dark Prophet. Rather
than repeat myself, I have included a letter which was sent to the
sysadmins of free.org which outlines their childish behavior in detail.

That file, SNELLE.TXT, is included in this release for you to examine.

 The one thing that struck me as odd was that the Dark Prophet claimed
that he was acting under orders from a particular "division" of CIA
that handles "matters such as these." So what he was basically saying
is that CIA has a subdivision of cyber mercenaries that go around
harassing and threatening anyone who doesn't op a CIA member? That's a
sad commentary on CIA as a group, if it is true. I don't even know
who's in charge of CIA anymore, but if you're reading this, I suggest
you review these two members of your group with great scrutiny, because
I speculate they have been acting as renegades and not under direct
orders from the group leader. You may deal with them as you wish.

 Anyway, Snelle's reply was swift and concurrent with my requests. This
must have angered the two juveniles, because they proceeded to move on
to even lower and filthier acts. A friend of mine, who I will only
identify as "hk," has a legitimate, paying account on cris.com. He gave
me full permission to use this account while maintenance was being done
on free.org. I graciously and gratuitously accepted his kind offer.
After about three days of using it, Mister Muff spotted me on IRC and
proceeded to inform me that he had "NARCed me out" to the cris.com
sysadmin and had given them my personal phone number. I then asked him
if he was serious or just trying to scare me, because I didn't think
even he could stoop to such levels. However, these are the exact, word-
for-word replies I got from him on IRC today.

[mistamuff!Mrmuff@viking.cris.com] the only thing i did is turn you in
to cris.com, i don't know what dp did, but it his business, if you want
to say shit, go ahead, i got your # bro, my account here is legit.

[mistamuff!Mrmuff@viking.cris.com] they already got you logged.

 Now as you can see, Muff HIMSELF is using a cris.com account, which I
believe is more than likely illegitimate and was fraudulently created
using someone else's credit card information. Despite his claims to the
contrary, I am sure he would not like the sysadmin to see the contents
of his directory, which I have already perused and spotted more than a
few pieces of incriminating evidence. "hk's" directory, however, has
never had and never will have any illegal or quasi-legal files in it.
In fact, during the entire time I have been sharing his account, he has
only had a public domain "Magic: The Gathering" game and a few pieces
of computer artwork in his directory. This, coupled with the fact that
I am LEGITIMATELY sharing this account with the full permission of the
owner, leaves me with absolutely no fear of any reprisal or retribution
from the sysadmins. I have done nothing wrong, and they have no reason
to pursue me as if I had. So, Muff's little scheme backfired.

 However, I want to make it known that Mister Muff and Dark Prophet are
NARCs and basically naughty little boys. The way Muff got my number was
this: when I joined up with CIA (probably the biggest mistake I ever
made, because of these events I have been describing), it was requested
that I disclose to them my phone number, which they could use in the
event of an emergency or if they urgently needed to contact me. It was
promised to me that my phone number would never be given out or used
for malicious purposes. However, Muff and Dark Prophet have done just
that. They have broken the trust which I placed on CIA when I joined.
Personally, I find this to be an outrage. If CIA does not discipline
its members to the point that they aren't running around crank calling
everyone whose phone number they have and making threats to them, just
because that person wouldn't op them on IRC, then the whole group needs
one collective boot in the ass. Think about it.

 To the rest of you, I urge you to take another look at CIA. Examine
their underhanded methods of "revenge," take a close look at their
members and the personal trust you may have placed in any of them. I
advise you to beware and be aware when it comes to CIA, because if this
is a typical example of their personal politics, then they are indeed a
force to be reckoned with; A pack of liars, NARCs, mentally-immature
chimps and back-stabbers. No offense to the members of CIA who do NOT
fit the above-mentioned criteria, but look at your comrades in the
group: are THESE the people you really want to be associated with?

 I think the evidence speaks for itself. I have done nothing wrong.
Mister Muff and the Dark Prophet are two boys with much too much time
on their hands, and not enough sense to know right from wrong. And as
far as CIA's little "mercenary revenge" division goes, if it truly does
exist, then I pity the entire group. This is an ART scene, guys, not a
damn warzone. Step back and take a look at the bigger picture.

                                         In Solidarity,

                                        valgamon@free.org
