     TODAYS TOPIC :

        The first Canadian PIRATE sysop to ever be charged
        with Copyright Infringement    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



     PRELUDE  :
     
     Well this is certainly news worthy.   Many folks would assume that
     surely somewhere, someplace in that great country to the North that
     we call Canada, that someone would have been busted long before now
     for software piracy. But this is truly the first sysop ever charged
     for software piracy.

     I was going to save Pirate's Manifesto VI for another topic when this
     fell into my lap and I figured that it needed maximum spreading to all
     the educated and intelligent folks who have been reading these little
     diatribes of elite information.  Here is why this is so interesting :

     All previous bust in Canada were always targeted against porno type
     bulletin boards ( which sometimes happened to have some copyrighted
     files on their system ).   The only other strictly copyright related
     bust I can recall was when Montreal's North 90 was raided several 
     years ago and the charges were dropped for lack of evidence because
     the police officers forgot to take the bulletin boards 'servers' for
     evidence ( Doh !  They were kept in another room and the cops only 
     took the terminals with the modems - double Doh! )

     But the funny thing about this historical event is - " Who the hell
     was the 'Shadow' BBS and exactly how lame was it to not come to my
     attention long before now ?   Hey I am the worlds most elite pirate
     right.   So how come I never heard of this dump in the 604 phone 
     exchange.   How come none of the truly world class bulletin boards
     in the 604 exchange were not busted ?   These are questions that 
     always bother me when I read news reports of bust in an area code.
     
     But enough of my shit.   Let us get on with reading this article and
     see what happened to this poor dumb shit whose board was infiltrated
     by snoops and spies from CAAST and the RCMP - triple DOH!


     ARTICLE BEGINS :

TITLE             :          Bulletin Board Sysop Charged with Software Theft
MAGAZINE          :          Computing Canada
ISSUE             :          Volume 20 Number 14
DATE OF ISSUE     :          July 6 1994
AUTHOR            :          Monta Kerr


     The system operator of a Vancouver-based electronic bulletin board
     system (BBS) has been charged with illegally copying software.
     
     Lee Thomas Adams of Burnaby, British Columbia, operated an alleged
     pirate BBS known as Shadow.  He was charged with 16 counts of copy
     right infringement after a several-month-long investigation by the
     Royal Canadian Mounted Police, assisted by the Canadian Alliance
     Against Software Theft (CAAST), in Vancouver.
     
     Adams is charged with copying software products from Borland Intl,
     Symantec Corp, IBM Corp, Lotus Developement Corp and WordPerfect.
     At press time, Stephen DeWitt, general manager of Toronto based
     Symantec Canada, said the vendors had not yet decided if they 
     would go ahead with a criminal prosecution or settle out of court.
      
     "Our goal is not necessarily to bring down the heavy hand of the
     law" he said.
     
     "But certainly if people are breaking the law..., we're certainly
     going to take a pretty agressive stance as far as that's concerned".
     
     The Canadian subsidiaries of Symantec, Lotus and Word Perfect are
     all members of CAAST, an organization working to prevent the 
     unauthorized copying of software.  CAAST reports that software
     pirates cost the industry about $ 12.8 billion (US) every year.
     
     DeWitt said piracy can have a greater effect on Canadian subsidiaries
     than on their US parents.  "Certainly Symantec as an organization is
     trying to provide services and products that are appropriate to the
     Canadian marketplace" he said, adding that Symantec Canada loses an
     estimated $1 million per year because of software theft.
     
     The loss of revenues as a result of piracy... impedes our ability
     to structure our organization in a way to better support Canadian
     customers.
     
     He said "underground" BBS's, distributing unauthorized copies of 
     software, are not the only offenders.  Some corporate users, home
     users and resellers also commit software theft, many without even
     realizing it is a crime.
     
     CAAST accepts reports of or questions about piracy through its 
     Anti-Piracy Hotline at 1-800-263-9700
     

     OBSERVATIONS  :
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
     Well this unknown dude certainly was an unlucky shit having those scum
     known as spies skulking about on his bulletin board for 'a couple of
     months'     I would assume at this point all the kewl boards in the
     604 phone exchange are shitting their pants wondering which of them
     is going to be next.   After all, the snoops weren't just on that one
     bulletin board looking for the products represented by that lame ass
     organization calls CAAST.   Those snoops would have been looking for
     other leads to follow up on in their quest for busting 'dem low down
     pirates'.   So I guess dumb ol' CAAST won't be stopping there and we
     can expect to hear them gloat more and more about their successes at
     gaining access to pirate bulletin boards - followed by the raids of
     their enforcers - better known as the RCMP.
     
     So who are these snoops that spend time infiltrating bulletin boards
     trying to find evidence to support a search warrant.   Well if you 
     were a regular reader of Pirates Manifesto, issue 1, you would know
     that these flunkies are none other than Pinkerton's and Wakenhuts
     Security.   Yes, none other than those 'cheaper by a dozen' rental
     goofs.   You may recall that we warned the world of the deal worked
     out by CAAST in Canada, SPA in the United States, and FAST in the UK,
     to employ the services of Pinkerton's and Wackenhut to infiltrate and
     bust pirate bulletin boards.  
     
     Enough of our gloating.   Just be warned that Pinkertons and Wackenhuts
     are the new investigative arm of those three anti-piracy organizations.
     
     
      CONCLUSIONS   :
      
      Let me conclude with the following observations that might come as a
      shock to some sysops out there who in sheer ignorance of the law think
      that if they put some kind of anti-entrapment statement on the front of
      their BBS they that will not be charged.   WRONG. In fact that very anti-
      entrapment screen on the front of your BBS might be the most valuable
      hint you are giving to the spies that yours is a BBS that is hiding 
      something.   But if you don't believe me... that is kewl.  You will
      find out later just how useless that anti-entrapment screen was when
      your time to go to court comes up.   That anti-entrapment screen is
      about as stupid as holding a cross in front of yourself to ward off
      vampires.   Get real and ditch it.   It stands out like a phucking 
      neon light flashing in the dark " Bust me... bust me... bust me..."
      
     Now what about those dumbo's who think that using the 'software library'
     scam is going to help them beat a copyright infringement charge.  WRONG.
     That scam is just about as dumb as my previous example.  The courts will
     simply laugh in your face and spit in your eye as they seize all your
     assets.   Think about it for a moment - what does a PUBLIC library have
     to do with a PRIVATE bulletin board.  Get the hint - PUBLIC - PRIVATE.
     That is the significant difference between a library and a pirate BBS
     and that is what the court will rule when they convict you of running
     a PIRATE bulletin board and not a PUBLIC SOFTWARE LIBRARY - quad DOH!
     

     LAST BUT NOT LEAST... AND MOST NASTY !!!

     Lastly, let us say a few words about the DORKS who have been compiling
     huge phone list of all the pirate bulletin boards in an Area Code and
     then sending them out onto the bulletin boards.   Congratulations you
     fucking two bit losers.  In your attempt to be 'kewl' you have handed
     the police, Pinkerton's, Wackenhut, the RCMP, the Secret Service, Bell,
     and every anti-pirate asshole the phone numbers and rankings of the
     elite bulletin boards.   Think what you have done you dick brains.

     Who the phucks payroll are these dickwads on.   Are they really so fucking
     mindless as to not think the cops and good guys were not going to get 
     their hands on those phone list.   Phuuuuckkk you guys must have the
     combined IQ's of a snail.

     Permit me to suggest that a FIREBOMB be gently hurled through the phucking
     windows of those dickwads who released that LEGENDS.ONT and named off all
     the 416 and 905 bulletin boards.   You dick wads really did a great favour
     by giving their phone numbers to every dickwad who read your shitty little
     grab for fame.   Maybe your next grab for fame will be as a headline in 
     the newspaper as the largest house fire this century.  Assholes.

     Please use what phucking little brains you have next time before you 
     attempt to be kewl by exposing all the 416 and 905 bulletin boards to
     the cops.   DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB  !!!

     For those who are not familiar with what i am bitching about, let me 
     just show you the final comments these dickwads placed on their telephone
     directory of every bulletin board in the 416 and 905 :  And I quote :

 (( Yes they listed over 350 phone numbers and ratings of boards in 
    the 416 and 905 - but at least we are not as stupid as them to
    repeat that complete list and all those vulnerable phone numbers ))


      -------------- TEXT TAKEN FROM  LEGENDS.ONT -- DATED 7-6-94 ----------



TOTAL ISSUE: 350 BBS ENTRIES!


        In the 416/905 Area Code 30-40 New Pirate Boards
        go up every month. In-order to keep the Underground
        informed of new systems, this publication will provide
        new system information every month. The 416/905 area code is
        larger than the 718 and 210 Area Codes, which originated
        the Pirate Scene. This FILE will be spread throughout
        Underground Systems and will attract quality users for
        the systems above. Any comments/Board Additions/Board
        Removals/BBS INFO can be left to us in the BBS Adds
        Echo, of NAPE_NET, OOF_NET, WOA_NET, RAD_NET, CAN/AM_NET
        INTERPOOL_NET, PHELONY_NET, VALIANT_NET, SYN_NET, INFI_NET
                        Remember we're watching
        According to your comments, we appreciate the current
        support. We're sorry that we didn't get all the boards
        out there, and thanxs to you callers we've been able to
        include many more systems. And to those that told us
        their systems should be up in the MAJOR PIRATE SITES,
        the selection is based on User Voting/Comments on Several
        Local Boards.

        Its June now, 6 months in the Running, and we're
        going strong!

        Special Thanxs to The Software Polluter, and Leoman

        for their numerous additions to this month's issue.
