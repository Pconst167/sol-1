  Recently, many unlawfully copied or modified programs have appeared on
various IBM PC bulletin boards across the country.  THE DIRTY DOZEN is a
list of known examples.
 
  There are four major categories of "bogusware": commercial pirate jobs,
unauthorized "hacks" of otherwise legitimate freeware programs, malicious
"TROJAN" programs which damage your system, and miscellaneous illegal
software.  A more detailed explanation of each category is given in the
definitions section of this document.
 
  SysOps: Please be careful with the files you post in your download
libraries!  Be suspicious when an uploaded game or disk utility appears to
be of professional quality, yet doesn't include the author's name, address,
nd distribution policy.  Such programs are probably NOT public domain!
 
  The BBS community is already under legislative threat at the State and
Federal level.  We cannot fight this trend effectively while our directories
sit stocked with "cracked" Sega games, 1-2-3 copiers and Wargames dialers!
Let's demonstrate a little social responsibility by cleaning up our download
libraries.  If you as a SysOp have any of these files on your system, please
delete them and post "blocking" dummy file entries like this one:
 
        ZAXXON.COM        DELETED!! NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN!!
 
  The idea behind THE DIRTY DOZEN is simultaneously to bring this issue to
the attention of more SysOps and users, and to act as an information clearing-
house for the latest known examples of "bogusware."  I need YOUR help!  Please
call in any updates of bad software that you know of; see the end of this
article for information on how to reach me with new information.
 
  A word on TROJANS: I have been hearing more and more reports of these
"worm" programs, from all directions.  While I don't doubt their existence,
let's not get hysterical.  Remember, a Trojan rumor is a lot easier to START
than it is to STOP.  Some people have accused "legitimate" *joke* programs, 
like DRAIN (which pretends to be gurgling excess water out of your A drive) of
being "killers." If a program locks up your system, it isn't necessarily
Trojan; it might not like co-residing with Superkey, or your graphics card.
Ask around a little before you announce something as Trojan.  I would
appreciate a bagged specimen of any real Trojan program that you might have
the (un)luck to find.
 
 A word on Pirated programs: Recently many pirated programs such as AUTODEX
have been going under many different names.  Although I will try to keep
all these names current in the DD, the best way to check and see if a
file is pirated is to run it yourself -- checking for (C)opyright
notices of commercial manufactures, similarities in looks and operations
of commercial programs, and of course whether the name is in this list.
 
  Starting with version 5.0 of the Dirty Dozen, "bad" files are
separated into two sections: one for those files that are pirated, and
one for those that are hacked or trojan.  This is because most of the
"bad" files these days are PIRATED, and in my view pirated files are
less important than TROJAN HORSES.  Therefore, the "Trojans" and
"Hacked" programs are listed first in this document.  More information
on "Trojan," "Hacked," and "Pirated" may be found at the "definitions"
part of this document.
 
  About two days before the release of this list, a user of mine notified
that a pirate had patched HARDHAT.COM to read "cracked by Eric Newhouse."

This is ridiculous!  Please disregard any programs that you may come across
in the future advertising "copy protection busted by Eric Newhouse, " or
the like.  This is just one more way that pirates are trying to get me
to stop publishing this list!
 
  Finally I want to thank all bbs SysOps and users that notified me of
updates, additions, and/or corrections to DIRTYDOZ.005.  It's great to
see so much support!  In this issue more than ever people called in with
updates.  As I said, thanks a lot!  Everyone else who reads this
list, along with myself, really appreciates your effort!
 
Final Note:    The author takes no responsibility for the validity or
              completeness of this list.  Many sources contribute to
              the list, and it is very possible that one of the reported
              "dirty" files works perfectly and is in the Public Domain.
              On the same token, it is impossible to write all existing bad
              software into one list.  Everyday users upload bad software
              to hundreds of boards, and often times the software is not yet
              in this list.  What I am saying, basically, is that if you run
              a trojan horse that is not listed in this list, don't call my
              board up blaming me for not warning you about the trojan;
	      rather, please call up and leave me a message so that I can get
	      the destructive program in the next issue.  If anyone is unsure
	      whether a file is trojan, and it's not listed in here, then I
	      recommend using a utility like BOMBSQAD.COM to prevent any
	      mishaps.
 
 
DEFINITIONS:
 
 
    HACKED    An unlawfully modified copy of an otherwise legitimate
              freeware or user-supported program.  It is illegal to
              distribute a modified copy of someone else's work without
              their permission.  If the modifying party has obtained
	      that permission, it should be mentioned in the program's
              display or documentation.
 
    *TROJAN*  BEWARE!! The purposes of these programs are to intentionally
              damage the computer system that they are run on.  Usually they
              will aim to disable hard disks, although they can destroy other
              equipment too.  It is IMPERATIVE that you let me know about any
              new examples of these that you find.
 
    PIRATED   This is an illegal copy of a commercial program product.
              Examples: a "cracked" (de-protected) game, an accidentally
              or deliberately distributed compiler, editor or utility;
              sometimes a Beta test copy of a program under development,
              handed out by a disgruntled employee or dishonest beta
              tester.  In the latter case, the program in question may
              never make it to market due to the pirating!  (But it's
              still unlawful to distribute it.)  In the case of games,
              there's a tendency for the pirate to patch a clumsy
              "PUBLIC DOMAIN" notice over top of the original copyright.
              ZAXXON.COM is a prime example.
 
 
    MISC      This is miscellaneous illegal software and/or text.
              The best definition, aside from that, that I can think of
              is that it's NOT pirated software.
 
 
NOTE: If no file extension is supplied, that means that the file has been
circulating under many different extensions.  For instance, BALKTALK has
been seen with extensions of:  .EXE, .COM, .EQE, .CQM, .LBR, .LQR, and .ARC.

|                    HACKED & TOJAN HORSE PROGRAMS:                        |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Name             Category  Notes
--------------   --------  -------------------------------------------------
ARC.COM          HACKED    Someone keeps running SPACEMAKER or a similar EXE
                            squeezer on SEA, Inc.'s ARC archive program, then
                            uploading the resulting COM file to BBS's without
                            the author's permission.  Not kosher, whoever you
                            are.  SEA will NOT support the COM version -- this
                            is an unauthorized modification.
ARC513.EXE       *TROJAN*  This hacked version of arc appears normal, so
                            beware!  It will write over track 0 of your
                            [hard] disk upon usage, destroying the disk.
ARC514.COM       *TROJAN*  This is totally similar to arc version 5.13 in that
                            it will overwrite track 0 (FAT Table) of your hard
                            disk.  Also, I have yet to see an .EXE version
                            of this program..
ARC600.EXE       *TROJAN*  This supposedly formats all hard disks on the
			    system that the program is run on.
BALKTALK         *TROJAN*  This program used to be a good PD utility,
                            but some one changed it to be trojan.
                            Now this program will write/destroy sectors
                            on your [hard] disk drive.  Use this with caution
                            if you acquire it, because it's more than likely
                            that you got a bad copy.
CDIR.COM         *TROJAN*  This program is supposed to give you a color
                            directory of files on disk, but it in fact
                            will scramble your disks FAT table.
DISKSCAN.EXE     *TROJAN*  This was a PC-MAGAZINE program to scan a hard disk
                            for bad sectors, but then a joker edited it to
			    WRITE bad sectors.  Also look for this under other
			    names such as SCANBAD.EXE and BADDISK.EXE...
DOSKNOWS.EXE     *TROJAN*  I'm still tracking this one down -- apparently
                            someone wrote a FAT killer and renamed it
                            DOSKNOWS.EXE, so it would be confused with the
                            real, harmless DOSKNOWS system-status utility.
                            All I know for sure is that the REAL DOSKNOWS.EXE
                            is 5376 bytes long.  If you see something called
                            DOSKNOWS that isn't close to that size, sound the
                            alarm.  More info on this one is welcomed -- a
                            bagged specimen especially.
EGABTR           *TROJAN*  BEWARE! Description says something like
                            "improve your EGA display," but when run it
                            deletes everything in sight and prints "Arf! Arf!
                            Got you!"
FILER.EXE        *TROJAN*  One SysOp complained a while ago that this program
                            wiped out his 20 Megabyte HD.  I'm not so
                            sure that he was correct and/or telling the
                            truth any more.  I have personally tested an
                            excellent file manager also named FILER.EXE, and
                            it worked perfectly. Also, many other SysOp's
                            have written to tell me that they have like me
                            used a FILER.EXE with no problems.  If somebody
                            does not confirm that this program is trojan,
                            I will take it out of the next issue..
FUTURE.BAS      *TROJAN*   This "program" starts out with a very nice color
                            picture (of what I don't know) and then proceeds
                            to tell you that you should be using your computer
                            for better things than games and graphics.
                            After making that point it trashes your A: drive,
                            B:, C:, D:, and so on until it has erased all
                            drives.  It does not go after the FAT alone,
                            but it also erases all of your data.  As far as I
                            know, however, it erases only one sub-directory
                            tree level deep, thus hard disk users should only
                            be seriously affected if they are in the "root"
                            directory.  I'm not sure about this on either,
                            though.
LIST60           HACKED    Vuern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read 6.0.
LIST799          HACKED    Vuern Buerg's LIST 5.1, patched to read 7.99.
MAP              *TROJAN*  This is another trojan written by the infamous
TSRMAP                      "Dorn W. Stickle."  The program does what it's
                            supposed to do: give a map outlining the location
                            (in RAM) of all TSR programs, but it also
                            erases the boot sector of drive "C:".
PACKDIR         *TROJAN*   This utility is supposed to "pack" (sort and
                            optimize) the files on a [hard] disk, but
                            apparently it scrambles FAT tables.
QMDM110.ARC      HACKED    ONLY versions 1.10 and 1.10A!  They are
QMDM110A.ARC               copies of 1.09, hacked to read 1.10.  There
                            have been rumors of a worm in 1.10, but I
                            have seen no evidence of it.  Other
                            versions are OK.
QUIKRBBS.COM     *TROJAN*  This Trojan horse advertises that it will
                            load RBBS-PC's message file into memory
                            2 times faster than normal.  What it really
                            does is copy RBBS-PC.DEF into an ASCII file
                            named HISCORES.DAT...
SECRET.BAS       *TROJAN*  BEWARE!! This may be posted with a note saying
                            it doesn't seem to work, and would someone please
                            try it; when you do, it formats your disks.
STAR.EXE         *TROJAN*  Beware RBBS-PC SysOps!  This file puts some
                            stars on the screen while copying RBBS-PC.DEF
                            to another name that can be downloaded later!
STRIPES.EXE      *TROJAN*  Similar to STAR.EXE, this one draws an American
                            flag (nice touch), while it's busy copying
                            your RBBS-PC.DEF to another file (STRIPES.BQS) so
                            Bozo can log in later, download STRIPES.BQS, and
                            steal all your passwords.  Nice, huh!
VDIR.COM         *TROJAN*  This is a disk killer that Jerry Pournelle wrote
                            about in BYTE Magazine.  I have never seen it,
                            although a responsible friend of mine has.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
COPYWRIT         MISC    Patch -- Although the real COPYWRITE is going around
                                  Bulletin Boards like fire, there is another
                                  illegal file under the same name.
                                  The former takes around 40 KB ARC-ed,
                                  whereas this takes about 2 KB.
                                  What I'm referring to is an archive of
                                  1-3 files that explains how to remove
                                  the serial numbers from copywrite. Now
                                  it's alright to "unprotect" a program
                                  for backup purposes, but removing serial
                                  numbers can only lead to piracy.
LOCKPICK         MISC    Text  -- This is a text file, usually with a
                                  .TXT extension, that casually explains
                                  how to pick locks.  I'm not sure
                                  whether this is illegal, but it's
                                  definitely in poor taste.
XTALK            MISC    Patch -- Like Copywrite, there is a patch circulating
                                  BBS's to remove the serial numbers from
                                  Crosstalk.

 This is the end of the "bad files list."  The rest of this document
contains instructions on what to do if YOU run a trojan horse, an update
history, a glossary, and information on how and where to contact me with
updates.
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
|                     If you run a trojan horse..                          |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 The first thing to do after running what you think to be a trojan horse is
diagnose the damage.  Was your [hard] drive formatted?  Did the trojan scramble
your FAT table?  Did every file get erased?  Did your boot sector on the [hard]
drive get erased/formatted?  Odds are that the trojan incurred one of these
.More..

four disasters..  After the initial diagnosis, you are ready to remedy the
problem.  Bear in mind that there is no better remedy for a drive that has
run a trojan horse than a recent backup..
 
 
    1)  If the trojan FORMATTED your hard disk:
         There is only one way out of this mess, and that is to use the
         MACE+ utilities by Paul Mace.  MACE+ has two devices in it to
         recover formatted disks, and believe me, they work!  More about
         MACE+ later.
 
    2)  If your FAT got scrambled:
         there is nothing to do.  However, there Is a program called
         FATBACK.COM (available on my board) that will back up your FAT
         table in under a minute to floppy.  Using FATBACK, it is easy
         and non time consuming to back up your FAT regularly.
 
    3)  If file(s) got erased, and the FAT table is undamaged:
         There are many packages to "undelete" deleted files.  Norton
         Utilites, PC-tools, MACE+, and UNDEL.COM will all do the job.

         I recommend the first three, but they are more expensive than
         the Public Domain program UNDEL.COM.  When you are undeleting,
         be sure to undelete files in the order of last time written to
         disk.  PC-tools for one automatically lists "undeletable" files
         in the correct order, but the other three may not.
 
    4)  If the boot sector on your [hard] disk gets erased/formatted:
         There are four things to do if this happens, and the worst that
         can happen is that you will go without a [hard] disk for a while.
         To be on the safest side, back up everything before even proceeding
         to step "A," although I can not see why it would be necessary.
 
          A)  Try doing a "SYS C:" (or "SYS A:") from your original DOS disk,
              and copy COMMAND.COM back onto the [hard] drive after that.
              Try booting and if that doesn't work try step B.
 
          B)  If you have the MACE+ utilities go to the "other utilities"
              section and "restore boot sector."  This should do the job
              if you have been using MACE+ correctly.
 

          C)  If you are still stuck, BACK EVERYTHING UP and proceed to do a
              low level format.  Instructions on how to perform a low-level
              format should come with your [hard] disk controller card.
              Be sure to map out bad sectors using either SCAV.COM by Chris
              Dunford or by manually entering the locations of bad sectors
              into the low level format program.  After the low level format,
              if your have a hard disk, run FDISK.COM (it comes with DOS)
              and create a DOS partition.  Refer to your DOS manual for help
              in using FDISK.  Then put your original DOS diskette in drive A:
              and do a FORMAT <drive letter>:/S/V.  Drive letter can stand for
              "C" or "B" depending on whether you are reformatting a hard disk
              or not.  Finally you are ready to attempt a reboot.
 
          D)  If you are still stuck, either send your drive away to be fixed
              by professionals, or live with a non-bootable [hard] drive..
 
 
 
 By now you may be saying to yourself:
 

"how can I get a hold of a 'MACE+' utilities package so that I can guard
against trojans?  Why, MACE+ can recover a formatted drive, undelete files,
and restore boot sectors!  I want to get it!"
 
 OK, there are two ways to get ahold of these marvelous utilities.  One is to
call up the Paul Mace Software Company (tm) and order them at a retail of
$ 79.95.  The other is place an order for them at the WEST LOS ANGELES
PC-STORE for $ 49.95.  The PC-STORE supports next day UPS shipping, so you can
be assured of getting the utilities fast.  The BBS phone # for the PC-STORE is
at the end of this document.

|                          Update History:                                 |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
    Version 1.0   Plans were drawn up for a "bad file" list and a dozen
                   bad files were entered in the list.
    Version 2.0   Saw the addition of a short introduction and about 10
                   more files.
    Version 3.0   Here Tom Neff and I started collaborating on the Dirty
                   Dozen.  About 20 files were added, and the introduction
                   was completely re-written.
 
    Version 4.0   By this time I totally took over responsibility
                   of the DD, as Tom Neff lost interest.  Another 30 or
                   so files were added to the list, making the DD 65+
                   files strong.  A few more additions to the introduction.
 
    Version 5.0   By the time version 5.0 was released, the Dirty Dozen
                   was being greeted favorably and with enthusiasm
                   around the country.  Updates started coming in with
                   regularity; the list prospered (if one can say that
                   about a list!).  A few more paragraphs were added to
                   the introduction, and 40 new files were bringing the
                   file total up to 103!
 
    Version 6.0   The Dirty Dozen has gotten to be such a big project that
                   I am now writing it in stages.  Although I am going to
                   make absolutely no effort to spread these "intermediate
                   versions," they will always be downloadable from my board.
                   This way if anyone so desires, they may keep an extremely
                   current issue of the DD, although the changes will only be
                   minor.  You might think of stage "a" of issue #6 as version
                   6.1, stage "b" as version 6.2, stage "c" as version 6.3.
 
 
                   New in version 6.0 is the following:
                       A) Many minor revisions,
                       B) 17 more files, bringing the total to 120!
                       C) Two new paragraphs in the introduction,
                       D) Instructions on how to recover from a trojan horse,
                       E) A comprehensive glossary,
                       F) This update history,
                       G) An acknowledgments section set up for major contrib-
                           utors of information regarding new bogusware,
                       H) A new bogusware catagory of "miscellaneous
                            illegal software."

?Q?          -- (? standing for any character).  File extension for SQueezed
                files.  Squeezed files are unusable until unsqueezed by a
                utility such as NUSQ.COM or USQ.COM.  The advantage of a
                SQueezed file is that it is  smaller than a regular UnSQueezed
                file, thus saving disk space and download time.  ARChives are
                more efficient than Squeezed files; that's why there are so
                many more ARChives on BBS's these days.  Example of the
                extensions of SQueezed files:  .EQE, .CQM, .LQR, .TQT,
                .DQC, etc.
ABBR         -- abbreviation for the word: "abbreviation"
