   and race the tracks to win the cash, the cup, and the glory.  Race 17     
   different tracks, all done in superb graphics, and when you get tired of  
   single play, you can even use modem/network play to challenge your buds   
   in a driving duel to the death!  Enjoy, and also pick up ZPC, cracked

              RAZOR - You've got some nerve to accuse us of putting out a    
                      non-working release in a fix for one of your own       
                      games!  As far as NBA Live '97 goes, yours was over    
                      the limit, which means its not even CONSIDERED a       
                      release by most major sites (go check and see who      
                      got nuked, you'll find that the ONLY sites keeping     
                      your version online are Razor sites!)  And as far as   
                      releases with the 1911 seal "not being broken," need   
                      I mention Privateer 2, Ironman, WWF Beta, and Red      
                      Alert?  You had as many non-working releases last      
                      month as we did, but you only put out 1/4 the games!   
                      What does THAT tell you about your "stellar" group?    
                      So, to summarize - you can take your "official"        
                      Razor label and stick it right here - on the official

   1.  Decompress all of the ARJ files into a temporary directory using the  
       included INSTALL.EXE.  After the install has finished, you may erase  
       the temporary directory.                                              
                                                                             
   2.  Change directory to the path in which you installed the game.  Edit   
       the file F1.CFG and make sure you change all the paths so that they   
       point into the directory where you installed the game.                
                                                                             
   3.  Run SETSOUND.EXE to configure your sound card, then F1.EXE to run!
