<H1>Piracy Textfiles: Applications to Join</H1>
<P>
Perhaps one of the wierdest sets of textfiles to have on here, these
are applications to join Piracy groups. Achieving this level of 
organization both confirms some peoples' fears, but also gives real
insight into what the priorities of the groups were. Personally, I find
it more encouraging and fear-weakening than anything else: You see in here
the typical clubhouse mindset of any small group; come join us, they say,
and get some glory. Insightful.
