Section IV:
______________________________________________________________________________
 
This part of the application I really don't find it terribly important, but we
have some people who THINK they can hack and phreak. We are just checking. If
you can answer these 5 questions then basically you can answer all the other
questions sysops usually put on their infoforms.
 
   Please Define:(not long)
 
     1) NAP/PA-
     2) CIS-
     3) UNIX-
     4) Blue Box-
     5) DNR-
 
There, that wasn't that long and complicated was it? Now for the 2nd part.
Explain in detail how to phreak, (if I know you, then forget it. If I don't
then start typing.)

  Well, this about sums up the application part for being a member of API.
One other application is: To be a distribution point or dropsite for our
stuff. That's about it. Return this to Laughing Gas or me on Solsbury
Hill II or like I said. Any self-respecting board out there. Thanks for your
time in filling this out, and you will be contacted shortly.
