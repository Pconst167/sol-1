If you are a STACKER 2.0 user with an SSWAPped boot drive, you can now
OPTIMIZE with a minimal amount of effort using an upgraded SSWAP.COM.
This file is available on Compuserve, the STAC BBS, and by mail through
STAC technical support.

The upgraded SSWAP handles the many changes OPTIMIZE makes "on the fly".  
It works with QEMM 5.XX as well as the latest version of QEMM 6.  Just 
copy SSWAP.COM to the STACKER directory in the C: drive as well as the 
STACKER directory on the SSWAPed host drive.  You can determine the host 
drive letter by typing: STACKER  at the command line. You must also use 
the /SYNC parameter on the SSWAP device line in Config.sys.

For example:   DEVICE=C:\STACKER\SSWAP.COM C:\STACVOL.DSK /SYNC

*Stacker 2.0, /EMS, and the QEMM 6 STEALTH option:
     If Stacker is using EMS and you choose to use QEMM's STEALTH
option, you must include the DBF=2 parameter on the QEMM device line
in Config.sys. For example:

    DEVICE=C:\QEMM\QEMM386.SYS RAM ST:M DBF=2          

Note for QEMM 6.00 and 6.01 users: 

     If you OPTIMIZE with the SSWAP upgrade and Stacker is using EMS, 
you will need to follow ONE of the simple procedure below.  This is 
because a conflict occurs when ANY two or more programs, which OPTIMIZE 
attempts to load high, access EMS memory during the OPTIMIZE process.

     NOTE:  Both procedures assume that SSWAP.COM has already been copied 
to both STACKER directories.  These procedures are not required for
QEMM 5.x, and 6.02 or later.

Procedure 1:

     A) Run OPTIMIZE as you normally would.  It will lock up during its
        final reboot.

     B) Power down the system, then power back up.

     C) Clean up by running QEMM's UNOPT.BAT which should be in the QEMM
        subdirectory on both the compressed and uncompressed drives.

     D) Run OPTIMIZE again.  This time it should work without incident.

 Procedure 2:

     A) Create a text file (using SEDIT) called OPTIMIZE.EXC.  (NOTE the
        EXC extension stands for "exceptions".  This file lists those
        device drivers and programs which OPTIMIZE should not attempt to
        load high.)  This file should be placed in the QEMM subdirectory
        on both the uncompressed and compressed drives.  In most cases
        it's sole contents should be the following text:

                          SSWAP.COM

        However, any other CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT device drivers and
        programs which access EMS memory (execpt for STACKER.COM) should 
        also be listed in this file, each on its own line.


     B) Run OPTIMIZE.
