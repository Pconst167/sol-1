
   ATTENTION ALL PROGRAMMERS...... I download alot of Shareware
   programs, and find many of them to be at least useful, if not great.
   But, I am real discouraged when I print out the DOCS, and watch my
   printer spitting out blank, or nearly blank pages.  Our planet can
   not afford this waste, and my personal file cabinet is running out
   of space.  COME ON, lets stop wasting our resources.  I get nothing
   out of looking at blank space on a piece of paper.  Next time you
   create a DOC file, how about filling the page.  And those completely
   blank pages (usually page 2 or 3 ) are a total waste.
   It has ome to the point that I have to edit the docs first, to
   eliminate all the waste.  Why should I or anyone else have to do
   this?   Please CONSIDER OUR PLANET, next time you write a DOC file.
   This has annoyed me for a long time, so it feels great to leave
   this message.  Thanks in advance for conserving our resources, next
   time you create a DOC file.
