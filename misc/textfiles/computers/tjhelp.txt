                   Revised: 08/07/1994

WILDCAT! 4.x
============
* Problems may develop using the DOOR.SYS drop file if you have
  a LARGE number of conferences. I would suggest picking up a copy
  of a file called FDOORSYS.ZIP written by Tim Rider (Tim can be
  reached on The Source BBS at 310-371-3737). Here is what Tim's
  documentation states:

  "WildCat! v4.0 allows up to 32,000 conference areas.  Due to the
   specifications of DOOR.SYS, all the conferences that a user is
   joined to are written to line #23 of DOOR.SYS.  32,000 conferences
   takes up a lot of room, and some SysOps have a DOOR.SYS file that may
   end up to be over 100k.  Some doors have been choking on the large
   DOOR.SYS, so I wrote this small utility to remove that line."

RENEGADE BBS
============
* If you are using BNU fossil driver and having problems with the
  doors, try using X00 v1.50+. Several Renegade systems have reported
  problems using BNU with the doors.

* If you are getting out of memory errors. Go into the System Config
  section, [E] System Toggles, then [U] to turn the SWAP FILE 'ON'.

TRIBBS v5.02+
=============
* Color ANSI checking will not work if you use TRIBBS.SYS drop file.
  Set the doors up using the PCBOARD.SYS drop file.

* If you use DOOR.SYS, TriBBS reloads this file and will deduct twice
  the amount of time that was actually used. Try using another drop
  file, or copying the DOOR.SYS to a seperate directory and then
  telling the door to look there for it.

* NOTE: This only applies to doors that you adjust the users time in
        the door such as Bordello, Studs, and Studette.

T&J Raffle
==========
* An ILLEGAL FUNCTION CALL will result if you enter a "closing
  date" that is not valid. If you want the door to lock at the
  end of the month, then put in the first of the month.

Remote Access v2.0
==================
* Using DOOR.SYS may result in an OVERFLOW error -- try using a
  different caller drop file such as DORINFO1.DEF. This is currently
  being examined!

Keyboard Timeouts
=================
* If you are operating on a 486 computer and getting a "keyboard
  timeout", you will need to set the following environmental variable
  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  SET NO87=ON

  This will turn off your co-processor and allow the door to function
  properly

Overflow Errors
===============
* Overflows can occur if you are running under DESQview and your tick
  counts are set too low -- try raising the tick counts.

* If you're running Wildcat! v3.9+ and are getting OVERFLOW errors,
  make sure NONE of your security level definitions have the MAXIMUM
  DAILY DOWNLOADS set to more than 32,000 -- anything over that will
  cause an OVERFLOW ERROR in ANY door using DOORFRAME.

Garbled Information on Remote
=============================
* If the door seems to operate fine on the BBS end but the remote
  cannot receive or receives garbled information, check and make sure
  you are passing the correct IRQ to the door (if you are running a
  non standard IRQ).

Graphic Cards (general)
=======================
* ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card - do not use the ANSI.SYS driver that
  came with the card. Use the normal DOS ANSI.SYS for the screens
  to show correctly.

* Trident SVGA Cards - You should have a utility disk with a file
  called TANSI.SYS, use this ansi driver instead of the standard
  ANSI.SYS.

DESQview/X
==========
* Make sure you have the MATH COPROCESSOR flagged ON even if you don't
  have a math coprocessor.

Lockups on certain COM PORTS
============================
* If you're running on a non-standard IRQ, be sure you are passing the
  IRQ on the command line!! Example:  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /5

  Studs! will now run on IRQ 5.

Upgrading to New Versions
=========================
* When you purchase a KEY from T&J Software, that KEY is valid for
  all upgrades also!

Wildcat! 3.x
============
* If you are running Studs!, Studette!, or Bordello!, you must use the
  caller drop file DOOR.SYS to make sure the callers remaining time is
  passed back to Wildcat!

* Wildcat! IM Version Setup using DigiFossil v1.3:

  All of our doors will run on the Wildcat! IM version using DigiFos
  v1.3. I have received TWO different setup routines concerning the
  IM version, here's an example:

  DF LOCK%WCNODEID%            -OR-      DF ON
  CD\WC30\DOOR\STUDS                     CD\WC30\DOOR\STUDS
  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /FD                  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG
  CD\WC30                                CD\WC30
  DF OFF                                 DF OFF

  Comments on either setup would be greatly appreciated!

Spitfire BBS's
==============
* If you're having trouble with the doors dropping carrier on exiting
  back to the BBS, switch to using DOOR.SYS instead of SFDOORS.DAT.
  On some Spitfire configurations this will happen when using
  SFDOORS.DAT.

Using DESQview
==============
* If you're running the doors under DV and you're getting ANSI
  character codes on the local monitor, be sure to load the file
  DVANSI.COM in the main batch file that starts your BBS!

Bulletin PATHS and FILENAMES
============================
* When specifying the bulletin path, be sure to also select a name
  for the bulletin! This could cause lockups when using Bordello,
  Strip Poker, and Video Poker. If you don't want bulletins created,
  simply enter the word NONE for the path and filename.

REGISTERED KEYS
===============
* Distribution of a registered key is against copyright laws, which
  carries significant penalties. If a registered key is found being
  distributed, all keys purchased from us (by the person distributing
  the keys) will be invalidated and the matter will be turned over to
  our attorney's. We do share this information with other shareware
  authors.

ERROR Codes (general)
=====================
* ERROR #53 - This error means a file was not found. If this occurs
  right when the door is opened, please check the PATH to the caller
  drop file (i.e. DOOR.SYS), or make sure the caller drop file is
  being created properly!

                            QuickBasic Error codes
                      DoorFrame uses the QB error codes.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2   Syntax Error                       61   Disk full
 5   Ilegal Function Call               62   Input past end of File
 6   Overflow                           63   Bad record number
 7   Out of memory                      64   Bad filename
11   Division by Zero                   67   Too many files
13   type mismatch                      68   Device unavailable
24   Device Timeout                     69   Comm-buffer overflow
25   Device fault                       70   Permission denied
52   Bad filename or number             71   Disk not ready
53   File Not Found                     72   Disk media error
55   File Already open                  74   Rename across disk
57   Device I/O error                   75   Path/File access error
58   File already exists                76   Path not found
59   Bad Record length

     The most common error that you will see is #62.  This is usually caused
by the CFG file not having enough lines.  I have included this list so
that you may be able to fix a problem that occurs with a T&J Software
door.

     Error #75 is usually an incorrect path and/or filename in the CFG
file.
