When the title screen appears, type 'AVALON'.  It should flash indicating
you now have unlimited lives!  If that doesn't work, try the following:

Start a 2 player game.  Make it as far as you can with player 1.
With player 2, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to collect
your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are going backwards to
where you started.  Push the THIRD cactus on the way back, and a yellow
pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player 2.  Continue playing with
player 1.  Every time player 1 dies, get the yellow pacman with player 2 and
kill player 2 immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman
with player 2, player 1 will never die.

Hints:

Level 1 - Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
          it and push it to the left.  This will give you a blue hat that
          will make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
          planes.

Level 2 - Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.  You will now be
          invulnerable for the entire level!

Level 3 - After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus on the way
          back for a free life.

- Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape
- Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted
- When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch away
  for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

Hold SHIFT and type 'FUND' for $10,000.  It will cause an earthquake every
third time you do it, so do it before you start your city.

Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.
This way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.
