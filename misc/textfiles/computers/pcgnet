All I can say about the August issue is that I'm VERY dissapointed...           
<sob!>. The First issue was great, Robert! Then you started adding all          
those stupid pic's and stuff... they make it look nice, but the greatly         
increase the size of the gazzette and make it impractical for modem             
transfer. And then with this last READER with all its bugs... it looks          
downright horrible... and the fact that you have to run the stupid batch        
file first to get it to work... dischipccable! I think you're going to          
HAVE to get some competition to get you back in fighting shape!! Let's 
have a nice, clean, fast issue like the 2nd or 3rd (The first one was a
little slow...). The scroll thing on the new one is OK, but I prefer the 
old method of reading... With the old issues, I'd call a new board 
anywhere in the country, and they would be there. These days, I haven't
even seen PCGAZ106.ARC in many of the local boards! It's a real 
disgrace, Robert... let's get rid of the cutsie pics and such, and make
it fast, nice, and small. I hope this does you some good, Robert, and 
doesn't just get you embarassed or pissed at me. I'm REALLY 
dissapointed... 
hope the ol' Gaz shapes up...!

Robert,
  Hi! I just got the August issue of PC-Gazzette out here in NY, and 
it's great!  I am putting together a Disk Magazine aimed at people 
involved in the stock market -- a tock market newsletter on disk, and I
want to know if there is any documentation, etc. for the READER program
so I could make my own newsletter?  Also, does READER automatically 
change the screens from color (if thats the way the screen was 
originally made) to black & white?
 
  Well, that's it, and keep up the great work!

Thanks for the nice comments. I am getting together some notes on the 
READER program for those who would like them. More on that later. The 
only trouble is, it is in a constant state of update. The last (3.0) was 
full of bugs and disappointed a number of people. 
  
As for the conversion from color to b&w, yes the program strips out the
color from the screens. They were made originally made in color.

FIRST OF ALL, I THINK PC-GAZZETTE IS GREAT!
THE METHOD OF DISPLAY AND ISSUE CONTENTS HAVE BEEN
FANTASTIC.
  
...BUT,
WHEN I READ THE AUGUST ISSUE USING READER 3.0
I WAS DISSAPOINTED.
 
I LIKE THE IDEA OF SCROLLING FOR THE REST OF A 
STORY, BUT READER 3.0 ADDED A CONFUSING SET OF
KEYBOARD COMMANDS TO THE PREVIOUSLY STRAIGHT-
FORWARD SET OF COMMANDS.
 
AT FIRST, I COULDNT GET SCROLLING AT ALL, THEN
I WOULD SCROLL FOR AWHILE, AND ACCIDENTLY USE
PAGE DOWN THINKING IT WOULD SCROLL DOWN FASTER.
OF COURSE, PAGE DOWN WENT TO THE NEXT STORY.
IN GENERAL, READER 3.0 IS FAR TOO CONFUSING 
TO USE.  TOO MANY KEYBOARD COMMANDS.
MOST ARE NOT EASY TO REMEMBER, OR INTUITIVE.
AGAIN, I LIKE SCROLLING STORIES, BUT CANT YOU
MAKE THE KEYSTROKES SIMPLER?
 
I DON'T LIKE TO COMPLAIN, ESPECIALLY SINCE I
THINK PC-GAZETTE IS GREAT.  I JUST HATE TO SEE
THE READER PROGRAM BECOME SO COMPLEX AND HARD
TO USE.
 
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, PEOPLE ARE READING 
YOUR ISSUES.

ok, I finally downloaded a copy of the gazette, since I finally found a
local (to me) bbs that has it available. But I have a few questions:
What is Gallery? was this some utility available in a back issue? if so, 
you better provide it in a separate ARC file so new issues that have 
gallery pictures can read them.
I also agree that we need the docs for TA. it is completely useless 
without documentation. 
also, I must remark that I didn't find a single item of interest in the
june (or was it july) issue. Shouldn't you consider the content of the 
magazine a little more closely? If you get lost in the format of the 
magazine, the content suffers. For example, a half page of graphics to 
announce that a Syntax's column will not appear this month??
As a professional in publication and typesetting, I have to tell you one 
basic fact: Format must be subservient to content. Jazzy graphics cant 
help a bit if you don't have anything to say of interest. If you just 
want to produce neat graphics programs, go for it! But don't advertise 
it as a magazine. With this, I go to download the current issue. Hope 
there's more content in this one....

I just spent 15 minutes downloading the new gazette so I could learn 
such interesting things as: The correct spelling of platypus (by the 
way, plural is platypi not platypuses), and that the compaq 286 is 
faster than the ibm? Come on! This stuff isnt worth downloading, let 
alone the trouble it takes to set it into the reader format.
To paraphrase Winston Churchill, "Never has so much been done by so few
for so little a result"...
Get it together, guys! If you don't have anything interesting to say, 
you can always find something more interesting (like a page from the 
phone book)...
Sorry if this is harsh, but I invite your rebuttal. Maybe you ought to 
take a closer look at this job. For example look at the Databoard:
ATDT766-6442
(sorry that was from my dialer) its in the 818 area code; they do an 
excellent job preparing interesting and useful data.
I wish you luck with your gazette, but you better get it together fast.
Nothing is more fickle than an audience. You will have to work hard to 
keep yours.

Wow!  Those guys hit real hard.  I think they are being sincere, though. 
They want you to be successful and offer their comments to try and 
assist you with an objective view of what you are doing.  I hope that 
you don't get discouraged by them though.  Maybe you need to collaborate 
with others to get material of greater interest.  There is material you
might want to check out at a MICROLINK user group meeting.  We have some 
information from IBM, members with expertize in writing composition, 
various program demonstrations that might look good reported in print 
and other topics that might interest the computing public at large.
 
If we at MICROLINK can be of any assistance to you in keeping this 
unique and superior product continuing, then don't hesitate to call on 
us.  This is one of the reason's we formed the user group.  There are a
lot of other benefits, too, but support of the computer user is still 
the main priority.
 
Keep up the great work and don't be put off by what is offered as 
constructive criticism.  This is a learning process for all of us.
 
Sincerely your;

First off, recheck your dictionary for the correct plural of platypus. 
My dictionary uses both spellings and it's a normal type dictionary. 
Even if it wasn't proper, the writer used it in a area that didn't 
require such accuracy. It was in an article on nonsense, remember?
  
The articles are submitted by various persons and if during a month none 
of those contributed seem interesting, we are sorry. Maybe our type of 
media is not your cup of tea. But, hopefully, you will find something in 
the upcoming issues. The August issue was large and complex and 
confusing and full of bugs. No excuses. The September issue will go back 
to some of the things that made the eariler issues nice. I will still 
have scrolling but with simpler commands. 
  
I think you might be able to help us get the Gazette "together". If you
can formulate your dissatifactions so eloquently and certainly get your
point across, we would sure like to read an article written by you. How
about it? Could you help us? Most of us claim no great journalistic 
skills (I'm a layout person myself and it's enough to just come up with
the Ramblings). Please don't get me wrong. This is not a challenge. Just 
a request. If a person sees a better way and can do something about it,
then maybe he should. Soapbox handed over for further discussion... 
Thanks for comments. They were enlightening.....Robert

Thanks for the support. I would love to come to your meetings. 
Unfortunely, they are on at a time I devote to my family. Priorities and 
such, I normally won't be able to make it. One of these days I will try
and come.
  
I am not put off by the comments. But hopefully these guys will accept 
any positive changes or even help out by contributing to the content of
the Gazette. One thing many people don't realize is that everything in 
the Gazette is contributed and done without any reimbursement. Hey the
Gazette is free, remember. It also requires time on all the authors' 
parts as well as my own. Some issue will have a lot of great articles 
and some may not (a lot, that is.). But over all, I think that the 
Gazette has been received as a good thing. We listen to the criticism 
and will try to improve the quality of the mag. If there are better 
writers, then let them write. Let's make the Gazette better. The opening 
words on it are "A User-supported Newsletter". I hope to keep it that 
way: by listening to suggestions and by publishing the best CONTRIBUTED
articles each month.
  
Don't judge August's issue as the wave of the future. The September 
issue will get back to basics. It will be tighter and smaller. It won't
take up your precious download time like the last couple.
  
Hope you like the changes. We DO listen....Robert

No, I wouldn't make remarks like that if I wasn't prepared to back em 
up. I would be glad to write a short article for the gazette, but time 
will be a little tight (isn't it always?) for the near future, due to me 
just quitting my job at Computerland. I'm sure I have a lot to say, 
especially since I've been in microcomputers since before the Apple I.
The question is, what is the audience, and what do they want to read?
If this is a magazine for all the BBS hacker kiddies, I don't know what
they're into (maybe a review of my new skateboard). I don't think there
is much of an audience for C programming either, anyone into C already 
has their own sources of info, I'm sure. Somewhere inbetween is a happy
medium. I think its about time for an audience survey of some kind..
This would be kind of hard, since PCgaz will drift around the country 
like all DNloads do. 
Let me know if you have any suggestions for articles or topics of 
interest to the readers.
p.s. I thought the new reader is really hard to use. It would be more 
logical to use Ctrl-Pgdn for changing chapters and pgdn for flipping 
pages instead of your vice versa arrangement. Most programs use PgDn in
this fashion, using Ctrl-PgDn for an "Amplified" pgdn of some sort.
P.P.S. you havent got the new gazette listed in the dnload files section 
yet...

Glad to hear you would help out. I will probably open the future 
directions to the readers in a survey with the Sept issue. The Sept 
issue is not out if that's the one you refer to. 
  
Yes version 3.0 is(was) a mess!!! I rewrote the scrolling routine and it 
uses the natural keys of up,down,pgdn,pgup,home, end. Also it will be 
back to double columns on most pages. So the scroll will be for full 
page and individual columns. The thought of Ctrl-PgDn for changing 
sections is one I hadn't thought of. Maybe.... I glad to hear from you 
and welcome any improvements to the mag. It gets hard to be objective 
when it's your baby. That's what this conference is for: Keeping us on 
our toes....Be talking to you...Robert

Your doing a great job, Robert.  Keep up the good work and I think your
requests for article submission is a terrific idea.  It's amazing how we 
take a free product and pick it apart, demanding more from the 
originator than we should.  Yours is not the only item to which I am 
refering (take a look at the ZIP conference on the Diamond Bar BBS and 
see what they do to Ed Dong).
 
We should be grateful and less critical to the people who utilize their
time to give us such wonderful computer programs.  I didn't see the 
August issue of the GAZETTE but I know the quality that is attempted by
the producer.  I am glad he goes to such effort on my part to bring me a 
unique way of spreading information.
 
Now let's hear more support for our editor and suggestions for 
improvement stated in a thankful tone (or else in a "Receiver Only"

Hey, if the product is getting stale, the maker should be told about it. 
Of course everyone likes to told his creation is the greatest thing 
since seedless watermelons but usually it isn't. The Gazette depends on
user/reader feedback in order to keep fresh and lively. Starting with 
the Sept. issue there will be a section called "The I/O Port" which will 
be exactly that: input and output between PC users. This board and 
others will be supporting a simple network that will provide lively 
discussion between users. Selected portions of these messages will be 
published in each issue. Hopefully this endeavour will be supported.
  
Anyway, thanks again for your support....Robert

Jay,
    I'm sorry, but I must go against your will and say one more thing. 
My last message was definately out of my uncalm and uncollective self, 
but I meant it.  I would like to further one of your points about 
"demanding more from the originator".  It is the many messages of hard 
core non-sence to the others that contain resonable suggestions that 
make all the public domain programs what they are.  If people were not 
open about what they felt about a certain software package, how would th 
e originator know what the heak the end user wants?  I'm glad they we 
have this thing called the Public Domain.  Let's utilize it for the 
benefit of all of us, and continue to support those who support it.
 
                                         Dave.

OK already! I once again forgot, that we sometimes state things more 
forcefully through these mediums, including gripes, so they can be blown 
out of proportion.. Sorry for blowing off some steam, but I think we are 
all frustrated at the amount of time and effort it takes to do things 
like the gazette, or write articles, or set up and collate all that 
material. I certainly would like to see more and fatter gazettes, with a 
surplus of articles & etc contributed by the public. To start things 
rolling, I will contribute some article & etc. info.
