A STACKER drive may be backed up like any other DOS drive.  If files reside 
on STACKER drive C:, back up the files on drive C:.  As your back up 
software reads data from the STACKER drive, STACKER transparently 
decompresses the data.  The back up program will then write the data to tape 
or diskette and recompress it (if it supports data compression).  These 
files may then be restored to any system in their original form.

Q: What about backing up the files on the uncompressed host drive?
A: In order to perform a full system back up, back up files on the host drive 
   as well as the STACKER drive.  You do not need to backup the hidden 
   STACVOL file.  This is essentially backed up when the files on the STACKER 
   drive are backed up.

Q: How do I restore my system in the event of a hard disk crash ?
A: After reformatting and installing DOS, install STACKER to create the 
   compressed drives.  Then, restore from the backup.
