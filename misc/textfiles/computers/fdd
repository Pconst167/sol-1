   If you haven't examined a CD ROM player for your computer yet,
 I suggest you do so. Offer to bring the refreshments of choice, and
 have one of your friends give you a demonstration, or have a sales
 person demonstrate a system that has a CD. You'll be impressed with
 the abilities of these machines. The amount of information and data
 that can be retrieved from a CD is amazing. The Multimedia CD's are
 quite impressive, if done well. I received the Microsoft ENCARTA CD
 as part of the promotional bundle with my system.

   The video and voice clips are quite interesting and there is quite
 a variety, from little bits of history shown to the sounds of dogs
 barking. The quality of the sound depends on your system, but I was
 driving my dog nuts, as she attempted to find the other dog in the
 house. If you don't have a CD, I feel you are missing one of the
 better resources available with a computer. Ensure the one you get
 is the double speed or better and complies with the multimedia
 standards. Then get on a good CD supplier's mailing list. A little
 tip here: some of the bundles available are a little disappointing.

 of interest to you:


                INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING

Copyright 1995 EPubNet

These days, word-processing and desktop publishing software gives
writers and publishers enormous power in formatting documents for
publication.  Unfortunately, this power is often thrown away before
the reader gets to the document, by printing it onto paper. Paper
lacks the flexibility and power of a computer processor.  Electronic
Publishing lets publishers retain the capabilities of the computer
for the use of the reader, by creating a document that is designed
to be distributed and read entirely on computer.

This is done in a number of ways.  A text may be created in universal
ASCII format, which is readable by numerous text readers, word
processors, and even with the DOS "type" command. Fidonews, the
newsletter for the 29,000+ Fidonet BBS systems internationally, is a
perfect example of this type of electronic publishing. A good text
reader program allows the user to quickly scan the document for a
certain word or phrase, page through it, and more.

A more powerful form of electronic publishing uses Hypertext.
Hypertext is a type of program which uses specially formatted
documents - the reader uses a "Reader Program" to view the document,
"jumping" between locations within a document using predefined
"links". For instance, an electronic textbook on the government might
contain a paragraph which refers to the US Congress. Rather than
including a note (see page 456), as a paper textbook would, the
electronic version would have the word "Congress" highlighted.
Clicking on the word would instantly take the reader to the part
of the book which explains Congress in more detail.

Alternately, the "Congress" link could pop up a small note which
gives a quick explanation of the topic, a diagram of the organization
of the two Houses, or even a VGA graphic showing the Capitol building
in full color. This method allows a writer to put basic and advanced
information out of sight, to be called only by those readers who are
interested in them. This allows a text to be informative and
interesting to readers with varying levels of knowledge - beginners
aren't confused by complex details, and experts aren't forced to wade
through basic explanations.

Electronic Periodicals are growing in popularity. By publishing
electronically, the costs of typesetting, printing and shipping are
eliminated. Publications can be distributed quickly and cheaply over
phone lines, making them much more timely than print publications.
EPubNet (see other bulletins) aids in this distribution greatly by
offering a network of BBS's to pass publications along without
charge. Currently there are many Electronic Periodicals in the form
of magazines and newsletters. There are also many books available.

Electronic Publishing has enormous potential for the future. Many
companies are already using the tools for training and marketing
purposes, as well as documentation and help systems for software.
As the concepts become more familiar, and software and hardware
becomes more common, the electronic format will become a major
supplement to the print format. Consumers will find it much more
convenient and inexpensive to have their favorite magazines
uploaded directly to their home computer within hours of publication
than waiting for the US Mail to bring it around to their mailbox.

The opportunity exists now to get involved in the ground level of a
breaking new industry. Take it!

***********************************************************************

FOR SYSOPS

EPubNet maintains an open invitation to sysops interested in
joining EPubNet, and tries to accommodate as many different
operating platforms and networking formats as possible. The core
of EPubNet is PC Compatible Fidonet systems, but the net is open
to gating messages and files to other network types, with permission.

REQUIREMENTS TO JOIN
There is no official application process for EPubNet. Below are the
requirements:

(1) Establish a link from an eligible hub
    This merely means contacting a current member of the net who is
    able to feed other systems, and asking to take the message
    and/or file areas from them. The HUBS.EPN file contains a list
    of EPubNet nodes willing to provide feeds. The Filebone is an
    alternative you may want to consider (see next section).

(2) Minimum Polling
    You must poll your feed at least once a week, more often if your
    hub requires it (to prevent unsent mail from taking up too much
    disk space).

(3) System Information
    At the end of this file the system information needed to list
    your BBS in the membership directory is listed. Once you have
    established a feed, please post this information in the EP-SYSOP
    echo.

(4) Required Message Areas
    All systems which receive EPubNet message or file areas should
    carry the EP-SYSOP message area, to keep in contact with the
    network.


FILE DISTRIBUTION

If you want to participate in file distribution, you just need
to ask your hub to set you up to receive them. Usually you can turn
them on and off as you like with RAID compatible requests, which work
like Areafix requests. A variety of programs are available to let you
process these files. Popular programs include TICK and ALLFIX. The
Fidonet FILE_ECHO backbone echo is a good place to find out about
these programs.


FILEBONE

The Filebone is a system within Fidonet which distributes message
and file areas for a large number of file distribution networks,
such as ANSINet (ANSI art), PDN (Programmer's Distribution Network),
and WinNet (For Windows programs).

National Hubs for the Filebone are listed in the FILEBONE.NA file,
along with the different file nets and file areas. You can get
EPubNet file and message areas from any of these hubs, along with
file and message areas from other file networks. If you are only
interested in the EPubNet areas you'll probably be better off linking
in through an EPubNet hub, since you'll get things quicker. But if
you're interested in getting other areas in addition to EPubNet, the
Filebone is a good bet.


EPUBNET LEADERSHIP

If you have a problem getting linked into EPubNet, or have other
questions, the following are the leadership folks you can contact:

        Network Coordinator / FileBone Liaison:
          Dave Bealer   (1:261/1129)  (V.34)

                        (505) 865-4082


SYSTEM INFO

Please post this info in the EP-SYSOP echo once you have gotten your
feed setup. This lets us know who all is hooked up, and get to know
each other.
