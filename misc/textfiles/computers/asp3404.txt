          The following programs are published by people and organizations
          who are members of the Association of Shareware Professionals.
          Many of these programs are available on a local bulletin board
          system (BBS) in your area.  This catalog may not contain all ASP
          products and it may not be current.  Comments about the catalog
          itself should be sent to the Association of Shareware Profes-
          sionals, BBS Catalog Editor, P.O. Box #5786, Bellevue, WA 98006.
          If you have a CompuServe account, you can also leave a message in
          section 8 of the SHAREWARE forum or send a private message to
          userID 70007,4004.


          What is the ASP?

          The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) was formed in
          1987 to strengthen the future of 'shareware' (user-supported
          software) as an alternative to software distributed under normal
          retail marketing methods.  ASP members subscribe to a code of
          ethics and are committed to the concept of shareware as a way of
          marketing.  See page 6 if you'd like to join the ASP or learn
          some more about us.

          The ASP itself does NOT rate members' software for functionality
          or usefulness.  That is for you -- the user -- to decide.  Share-
          ware software, especially that which is authorized to carry the
          ASP logo, can be tested on a try-before-you-buy basis.  If the
          application doesn't fit your needs, you won't have to worry about
          getting a refund.  (That's the beauty of the shareware marketing
          concept.)

               'These programs are produced by members of the Asso-
               ciation of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to
               make sure that the shareware principle works for you.
               If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
               with an ASP member by contacting the member directly,
               ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you
               resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but
               does not provide technical support for members'
               products.  Please write to the ASP Ombudsman at P.O. Box
               5786, Bellevue, WA 98006 or send a Compuserve message
               via easyplex to ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536'


          Tips & Hints

          If you have questions about a particular product, check in the
          index to see if there is a cross-reference for the program.  An
          entire appendix is devoted to authors' addresses & telephone
          numbers.  You might be able to get some help from them.

          New or updated programs are marked with '[***]' in the far right
          corner.  You can use your favorite word processor to hunt for
          that string so you can see what's changed since last month.

          The 'BBS filename' shown with each product is the author's
          preferred spelling for the filename and it usually has some sort
          of connection to the program's version number.  If your local BBS
          has an earlier version of the program, it will probably be under
          a different filename.  Even if it is the current version, some
          people upload the file as a different filename.  You would be
          wise to search for variations in spelling.  Your local BBS sysop
          can tell you how to do this.

          ASP authors are only human, and they sometimes forget to supply
          all information before this list goes out.  We apologize if you
          see '??' where there should be a piece of information.

          Some applications are contained in multiple files, but you should
          be warned of this in the description.

          Be sure to check the file size BEFORE you begin downloading.
          Many of these products are bigger than 100k, and some are bigger
          than 200k.  Find out how big the file is before you go for it.

          A few applications have what can be described as 'conditional'
          fees.  Some may only need to be registered if the program will be
          used in making a profit.  Others may offer source code to the
          program for a higher fee.  The price you see here may not always
          be the price you have to pay -- it could be higher or lower.  It
          'pays' to read the fine print in the documentation provided with
          any shareware application.

          Enjoy the catalog.

            of 6 lines for interpretation. The I Ching's "yin & yang"
            philosophy fits the "yes & no" or "0 & 1" mentality of the

          Description:
            BESTGUES is a task planning tool designed to help you get a
            better handle on time estimating. BESTGUES helps you figure out
            how much time a task should take by making it easy for you to
            break the task down into smaller chunks (up to 15), and
            estimate minimum, typical and maximum times for each chunk.
            Then BESTGUES gives you several estimates of the total time,
            and the probability that the task will be complete in that
            time. BESTGUES is fast, friendly and effective.

                                  AUTHOR ADDRESSES

          This appendix is designed to let you find the name & address of
          ASP authors & companies with a product you'd like to know more
          about.  Some offer non-registered evaluation disks through the
          mail for a nominal fee.  Others publish telephone numbers you can
          call for more information.

               Shareware is as safe as commercial software if obtained
               directly from an author or from a vendor or BBS who has
               gotten the disk directly from the author.
                              -- an official ASP statement on shareware

          You can manually search this appendix for information about a
          product, or you can use the index to find the right page.  All
          you need to know is the name of the product (not the name of the
          file).  Product names are almost always noted in the description.

          One final note: this appendix is "free format".  Authors can say
          whatever they like as long as they don't go over four lines.  We
          encourage them to include an address and maybe a phone number,
          but it's up to them.  What you see here is exactly what they told
          us to put in the appendix.

          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.

          _________________________________________________________________

                                DISK VENDOR ADDRESSES

          This appendix is designed to let you find the name & address of
          disk vendors who maintain an associate membership in the ASP.
          Every one of these disk vendors meets the ASP's minimum standards
          for business ethics in the field of disk copying services.

               Shareware is as safe as commercial software if obtained
               directly from an author or from a vendor or BBS who has
               gotten the disk directly from the author.
                              -- an official ASP statement on shareware

          Disk vendors, especially ASP-approved disk vendors, provide a
          much-needed service in the growing shareware market.  They help
          spread the word about shareware by offering a copying service for
          those without modems.  They keep up to date with current versions
          of the best shareware programs on the market.  Many disk vendors
          offer a free complimentary catalog of products, a toll-free order
          line, and more.

          A final note: this appendix is "free format".  Disk vendors can
          say whatever they want if they keep it in the space provided.
          What you see here is exactly what they told us to write.

          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.

                              PROGRAMS NO LONGER IN ASP

          The Association of Shareware Professionals, like most organiza-
          tions, occasionally loses members.  This is a list of shareware
          products and disk vendors that were at one time covered by ASP's
          guidelines but are no longer.

          We hope you find this appendix to be useful.


          Shareware products

          In some cases, authors voluntarily retire a program and no longer
          support it.  These authors usually remain in the ASP and, as
          members, agree to return all money sent in for the product from
          that point on.
