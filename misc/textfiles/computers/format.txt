          GIF files can be viewed on many different types of personal
     computers. These machines have programs available which allow
     for the viewing and conversion of GIF:
 
               Apple Macintosh & Macintosh II
               Apple ][ GS 
               Atari 8 Bit and ST
               Commodore Amiga
               IBM PC,XT,AT, PS/2 & Compatables
               Tandy 2000 and Tandy 1000
               Texas Instruments Professional
               Tandy Color Computer ][ (Coco)
               (and the list is growing)

          The image you send us is digitized into the GIF format
     of your choice.  The resultant digitized images view quite well on
     all these computers. Apple ][ and Hercules have no color of course,
     and IBM CGA has only four colors.  But remember that only MS-DOS
     computers can take advantage of this offer as we do not have
     computers other than MS-DOS machines.  The GIF image is universal
     but if you can't read the MS-DOS formated diskette then we can not
     help you.... unless you make some arrangements with your sysop to
     download the digitized images.  However, this would cost you about
     three times the stardard price.
 
          Our digitized photographs are available in the following
     formats: (you make the choice on how you want them digitized.
     You let us know on the ORDER FORM.

           You can use VGIF.EXE to convert any of your GIF files into
        any of the following format.  VGIF is found here on this
        system.
