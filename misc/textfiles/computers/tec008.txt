This note provides a checklist for troubleshooting the Stacker version 1.x 
(8 bit) coprocessor, and the Stacker 2.0 XT/8 (8 bit) and AT/16 (16 bit) 
coprocessor cards. 

Symptoms:
A Stacker coprocessor installation exhibiting the following symptoms will merit 
further investigation:
   1. During Install, the coprocessor may fail to respond at all the addresses.
   2. The Stacker.com message: <Coprocessor card not functioning. Invoking 
      software driver> may appear at boot time.  

Solution: 
First check the basics.
   1. Check to ensure the card is properly seated in the slot.
   2. Check to ensure the /B parameter in the Stacker driver contains a valid 
      address.  Possible base addresses are listed in the 2.0 manual pgs. 43-47 
      and on page 17 in the version 1 manual.
   3. Run Install to test all addresses.
   4. Try adding each address to the driver in Config.sys and COLD BOOT (Reset 
      or a power down/up).  A cold boot is necessary to flush addresses.
   5. Try a different slot.
   6. Try rearranging the order of the cards in the expansion slots.
   7. Try disabling SHADOW RAM (Scratch RAM) if present.  This is done in the 
      BIOS setup at boot time or on some memory manager device lines in 
      Config.sys.
   8. If possible, try the card in a 2nd machine to see if the problem is with 
      the card itself.

Card specific issues:
  *XT/8: or a Stacker version 1 coprocessor card, 
   1. Check for address conflicts with a memory management program. Fixing 
      this problem usually involves adding memory exclude statements to the 
      memory management driver.  Try starting with the range C400-DFFF to 
      enable the testing of all possible addresses during Install.
   2. If the XT/8  card is in a 386 machine, it may be that the motherboard 
      maps memory over the addresses that Stacker uses to access the card.  
      Refer to your system user's guide for more information.
   3. Version 1.11 or prior with 16 bit VGA card, there may be a conflict  
      between the VGA card and the coprocessor.  Test the card with the VGA 
      card set to 8 bit mode.  If this eliminates the conflict, call STAC 
      technical support. 
  *AT/16
   1. Something (usually another add-in card) is conflicting with the address 
      of your AT/16 card. Check the hardware addresses for your other cards 
      or change the hardware address for the AT/16 card.
   2. The buss speed may be greater than 8 Mhz.  This value can sometimes be 
      set in the BIOS.  It is usually set as the clock speed (CLK) divided by 
      some number.  Try setting the speed to 8 Mhz or less to test. If buss 
      speed is the issue, call STAC technical support.
  *MC/16
   1. You must install and configure the MC/16 card before installing Stacker.
