          The DoubleSpace DEFRAGment command is used on a DoubleSpaced
          compressed drive. The program doesn't really defragment the
          drive, however it does consolidate the free space.   Do this at
          least once a month.  It should be considered routine hard drive
          maintenance.  First use the CHKDSK command.
             
          1.   Change to the compressed drive and then issue a CHKDSK
               command like so:
               
                         c: <ENTER>
                              
                         chkdsk /f <ENTER>
          
               The /F tells DOS to fix errors. 
          
               Another option is to do it like so:
          
                         dblspace /chkdsk /f  <ENTER>
               
               A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /CHKDSK /F command is:
          
                         dblspace /chk /f  <ENTER>
          
          2.   Defragmenting a large hard drive can take a very long
               time.  To consolidate a DoubleSpace compressed drive,
               change to the compressed drive and then issue a command
               like so:
          
                         dblspace /defragment <ENTER>
               
               A shortcut for the above command is:
               
                         dblspace /def <ENTER>
