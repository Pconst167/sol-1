  TITLE:
      WINDOWS 3.0 in enhanced mode and STACKER

  OVERVIEW:
      WINDOWS is a memory-intensive program.  It can be run in enhanced mode to
      take advantage of extended memory, and such operation is compatible with
      STACKER.

  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
      1) When the XT/8 coprocessor board is present, its address range must be
         excluded in the WINDOWS SYSTEM.INI file.  Overlooking this step can
         lead to corruption of the Windows directory.  Omitting the EMMExclude
         can also lead to "Insufficient Memory" errors when launching Windows
         programs.
         Use of the AT/16 coprocessor presents no such problems.

      2) Permanent swap files cannot reside on the STACKER volume; (Windows
         does not present it as an option).

      3) Temporary swap files should also reside on the uncompressed drive.

      4) With third party (non-Microsoft) memory managers, certain files
         must exist in the identical directory paths on both the compressed
         Stacker drive and in the uncompressed boot drive.

              386MAX           BLUEMAX             QEMM386
              -----------      ------------        ------------
              386MAX.SYS       BLUEMAX.SYS         QEMM386.SYS
              386LOAD.SYS      385LOAD.SYS         LOADHI.SYS
              386MAX.VXD       BLUEMAX.VXD         WINHIRAM.VXD

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
      1) If WINDOWS is run in enhanced mode AND the XT/8 coprocessor board is
         installed, add an EMMExclude statement to WINDOWS\SYSTEM.INI under the
         heading [386ENH] (see User's Manual, "Microsoft Windows 3.0 in 386
         Enhanced Mode Users").  This should be done BEFORE WINDOWS is loaded,
	 and can be accomplished using any text editor.  (If the coprocessor is
         disabled, SYSTEM.INI may be modified using NOTEPAD.)
 
      2) If a permanent swap file will be part of the configuration, leave
         sufficient uncompressed space on the host volume.  If there is not 
	 enough uncompressed space and you have Stacker version 2.0 or greater,
	 use SDEFRAG to physically shrink the STACVOL file.
         If you are using version 1.12 or lower,the STACKER volume must be 
         SREMOVEd, and a smaller one created.

      3) Temporary swap files left on the uncompressed drive will not cause
         fragmentation in the STACKER volume.

      4) If the STACKER volume becomes corrupted or write-protected due to an
         interrupted 386-enhanced session:
          a) verify that STACKER coprocessor card address has been excluded in
             SYSTEM.INI;
          b) run SCHECK/F on the STACKER volume;
          c) delete the WIN386.SWP (temporary swap) file;
          d) run SCHECK/F again;
          e) reboot before writing anything to disk.
