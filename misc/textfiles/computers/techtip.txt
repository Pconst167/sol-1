The following tips were retrieved from the Micropolis BBS as tech tips
which their support team uses in resolving customer issues. 

1.   Ultrastor 12F when installing NETWARE 2.15A                  
     Low-level format using the physical parameters(no            
     translation) to use the full capacity of Micropolis drives   
     that exceed 1024 cylinders. Install Advanced Netware 2.15A   
     using the "Default" configuration.

2.   Ultrastor 12F in EISA machines.
     To configure an Ultrastor 12F in an EISA bus you must use the
     file USC0120.CFG located on the ultrastor diskettes.

3.   WD1007x 
     Say "NO" to "enable alternate sectors?" during low-level the
     format. The use of alternate sectors will disable WD1007x  63
     sector translation mode.  *NOTE* alternate sectors may be
     enabled when no translation will be required.

4.   WD1007v-SE1/SE2
     Models 1568-15 and 1664-7 must have the W2 jumper removed from
     the drive.  Removing the W2 jumpers changes the drive geometry
     from 54 to 53 spt. The WD1007V does NOT support 54 spt.

5.   SCSI 
     The drive and host adapter must have different SCSI ID's.
     Conflicting SCSI ID's will cause a variety of problems.

6.   ESDI Drive Splitting
     Enabling drive splitting with ESDI controllers will limit the
     system to one physical EDSI drive. The computer CMOS must be
     set for two physical drives set to type (Type 1)

7.   ESDI 
     When using ESDI controllers and drives, you must be sure that
     the controller has a transfer rate equal to or higher than the
     drive. Eg.. WD1007A is a 10 Megahertz controller, with a 1664-
     7 which is a 15 Megahertz drive. This is an incompatible mix.

8.   UltraStor and Netware
     UltraStor 12/f is certified for Netware 2.2 and Netware 386
     v3.11 with the Rev 009 bios on the controller.

9.   In-2000 Synchronous negotiation 
     Set SW-8 to "ON" position to force the IN-2000 to initiate 
     synchronous negotiation.

10.  HS Code
     HS code supports 512 bytes per sector only. This applies to
     firmware P/N  800574-XX-X. 

11.  RS6000
     HSP4 (800574-03-0) will issue an Illegal request in
     CDB(05/24h) when formatted with AIX "Service and Diagnostics
     Module". ASOC must be used in an IBM RS6000 machines. HS code
     doesn't support a command issued by the RS6000.

12. Future Domain 1680 Host Adapter
    Disk Manager will not initialize a drive over 1.2 gigabytes.  
    You must use have a bios revision of 2.0 and higher for the   
    Future Domain 1680. You must use Disk Maestro or Debug to     
    format the drives.

13. SCO UNIX
    The boot partition must reside under 1024 cylinders or you will 
    have erratic behavior of the OS.

14. Ultra 12f-24 with Two drives
    When a 1518-15 is attached to the 12f and additional drive will 
    be will be added , the bios on the Ultrastor should be Rev.   
    -010.

15. DPT / MYLEX WITH 1598 AND 1528
    The firmware on the drives must be DD24_1 to work with DPT and 
    Mylex Host Adapters.

16. PS2 Model 95 and 1528 
    Configure automatically with the reference diskette and the   
    utility will return '????' as the 2nd drive.  
    After configuration, the drive will respond normally.

17. Always and UNIX / XENIX
    If a customer has problems creating the N1 boot diskette, the 
    customer can call Always and they will create the N1 diskette 
    for the customer.

18. WESTERN DIGITAL 7000FASST
    The WD7000FASST host adapter does not support parity.         
    Micropolis drives must have parity disabled by placing a jumper 
    on W9 on the 1674 /1684 or w4 on 1578/1588/1598/1528. On the  
    models 1548/1908/1624 drives to disable parity jumper in 13-14 
    in the J2 connector. (Download the drive spec sheet from the  
    files section of the BBS).

19. ULTRASTOR(ALL CONTROLLERS)
    Ultrasor ESDI controllers will not co-reside with any other   
    manufacturers controller card under Netware.
