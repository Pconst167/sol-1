          SHAREWARE, PUBLIC DOMAIN, FREEWARE AND COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE
                     
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       SHAREWARE is software which has been prepared by a variety of
       individuals and companies. The concept governing shareware is 
       that you "try before you buy." Shareware is above all a unique
       marketing experiment which operates on the "honor system."
       In practice, shareware is frequently of the same quality as 
       commercial software. However, it uses a different, and somewhat 
       less expensive method of marketing which involves letting 
       others freely copy, use and distribute the shareware. What you 
       receive from your friend at work, computer club, commercial 
       shareware disk distributor or BBS modem system is a "disk 
       evaluation copy" which you may use, copy and above all TRY. 
       
       Documentation and instructions for program use are usually 
       contained within special text files on the same disk as the 
       program and sometimes take a little detective work to locate.
       Formal printed documentation and instruction books may also
       be available from the author.
       
       If you like what you find and use the program consistently -
       many shareware authors suggest 30 days, but this is not a 
       firm rule - then you are expected to register the shareware 
       by submitting a fee usually by mail to the author which 
       frequently brings additional benefits sent back to you by 
       the author of the shareware. Above all, it is legal to copy, 
       distribute and USE shareware.

       Computers improve the world, shareware improves computers 
       and registration is what improves and motivates shareware 
       programmers who are called "authors" in the trade. 
       
       If you do not submit a registration fee AT LEAST send a
       postcard with your thoughts on why improvement is needed.
       You just might NEED and USE the revised version which is
       produced due to your funding or critique. Either way, feedback
       is essential to the shareware process!
       
       The registration fee requested by the author is a matter of good 
       conscience since shareware registration fees are paid by
       users directly to the author "on the honor system." Paying 
       an honest registration fee frequently means you will receive 
       additional disks for the program or further instruction 
       documents, bonus items or other "inducements" directly from the 
       author. 
       
       Registration is more than this though: on a human scale your 
       registration fee is supporting a small company or individual 
       who shows you how to use and understand a computer. A programmer 
       is a craftsman whose tools are logic and considerable creativity. 
       Your registration check is a special bond which allows this 
       quiet "honor system" of submitting your registration fee 
       for a programming job well done to motivate creative programmers 
       to produce some rather astonishing products! 
       
       The best way to summarize is this: you are not registering a 
       product, you are helping a person or small company do something 
       which improves how man uses the computer, most important tool of 
       this century. Paying a registration fee to the author of the 
       program rewards technical craftsmanship for providing creative 
       computer solutions at unbelievably low cost. Good programmers are 
       rare creatures - a small registration check goes a long way and 
       means a lot to a small shareware author!               

       PUBLIC DOMAIN software is a second type of computer software 
       which is NOT copyrighted and has no other legal restrictions
       as to use by the general public. The author may or may not
       be identified. Most public domain programs result from the
       efforts of a programmer who designs a small piece of software 
       for personal use. The author may not decide to invest 
       additional time in developing and marketing the software due to 
       lack of market knowledge or lack time and funds to effectively 
       develop it into a larger commercial or shareware package.
       For these and other reasons, the author does not copyright the
       software and allows it to be copied, used or even incorporated 
       into other software packages since it is part of the public 
       domain available for the common good.

       FREEWARE is related to BUT NOT the same as public domain 
       software. Freeware requires no registration fee or reimbursement 
       for use by the public but the copyright is RETAINED BY THE 
       AUTHOR who notes a copyright restriction within the body or
       documentation of the software. A reason for this subtle
       difference is that the author may, at a future date, wish to
       reclaim all or part of the software or modify and reissue
       the software as shareware or commercial software. The copyright 
       continues the unique claim of the author to the product.

       COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE is computer software provided by a company 
       or individual which is generally marketed via retail, wholesale 
       or other commercial means but does not use or promote a 
       registration fee concept, a "try before you buy" concept, and
       does not use or promote sharing copies of the program among 
       individuals or other enterprises. The user is expected to purchase 
       the right to use the package BEFORE being allowed to use the 
       software extensively.

       Note that either purchase or registration of any software 
       package does not mean you own the package, merely THE RIGHT AND 
       LICENSE TO USE IT. The author or company which produced it owns 
       the software programming code and is granting you a LICENSE to use 
       it in exchange for a fee or other compensation. In essence you 
       do not buy or own software, you merely license its use. The 
       author owns it.

                      EIGHT EASY STEPS TO USING SHAREWARE

       --------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       Print this section and keep it next to your computer! These 
       steps are the secrets to using shareware! We will look at each 
       suggestion in greater detail in just a moment . . .
       
       1) Make a copy of the shareware disk, store your original
          and work with the copy.
       2) Do a DIRECTORY LISTING of the disk(s) on paper or your
          monitor screen.
       3) Determine FILE TYPES using extensions and filename clues.
       4) Read DOCUMENTATION and TEXT FILES if available on disk.
       5) Unpack and install the program.
       6) Configure the program if necessary.
       7) Run the program.
       8) Submit a registration fee or at least postcard(s)
          with your regrets to the author and the disk vendor.

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
                   MINIMUM DOS COMMANDS FOR USING SHAREWARE
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       Before we move forward, a brief refresher course in several
       basic DOS operations without which a shareware disk is useless.

                                DOS SYNTAX

       A DOS command must always use the same syntax illustrated
       below:

       COMMAND <blank space> WHAT? <space> WHERE? <press return/enter>

       Example: COPY PCLEARN.TXT B:  <press return/enter key>
       Example: TYPE PCLEARN.DOC     <press return/enter key>

       In the second example DOS assume the WHERE is the screen.
       In the first example DOS needs to be told that a copy
       of a file is to be sent to the B: floppy drive.

       NOTE! Generally DOS commands, drive letters and filenames
       and be typed in upper or lower case or both, since DOS
       is not fussy in that respect. It is ok to use capital letters, 
       small letters or any combination.

                                THE DIR COMMAND
       
       An essential command which displays the names of the files 
       on a disk.

       Example: A>DIR <press return/enter>   
       
       Lists files on the diskette your are in THE DEFAULT DRIVE, in 
       this case is A:

       Example: A>DIR B:

       Lists files in the B: drive. We have omitted the <press enter/
       return> since you already know this is necessary after a DOS
       command.

       Example: A>DIR /P

       List files in current default drive but pause after each 
       screenful of information.

       Example: A>DIR B: /P

       Same as above, but list the files on B: drive with a pause.

       Example: A>DIR /W  

       List current default drive but display in wide screen mode
       for numerous files.

       NOTE! With any DOS operation which rapidly fills and overflows
       the screen with data, try pressing CTRL-S (control or ctrl key
       plus the S key together at same time) to pause the screen.
       Any key touched resumes the scrolling display and CTRL-S
       repeated pauses again. Very handy!

       NOTE! Switching drives is easy. If you see this:    A>
       and you want to change the default drive to this:   B>
       then simply do this:       A>B:   <press return/enter>
       Switching default drives is an essential skill!

                              THE FORMAT COMMAND

       This prepares a blank disk to receive new information. You must
       format disks out of the package from the store before you can 
       use them. Formatting tests a disk and installs magnetic tracks
       where information will later reside.

       Examples:

       C>FORMAT A:           format floppy in A:
       A>FORMAT B:           format floppy in B:
       C>FORMAT B:/S         see below for explanation . . .

       The last example formats the disk in B: drive and also adds the
       special system files so that the disk can be self starting
       or self booting. Not essential with most disk you will work 
       with. You MUST have the special file FORMAT.COM on your disk or 
       hard drive to able to do this operation since FORMAT.COM normally
       resides EXTERNALLY on a floppy or in a special area of your hard 
       drive.

                        THE COPY AND DISKCOPY COMMANDS

       Moves, copies and even renames files as they pass from one
       disk to another.

       Examples:

       A>COPY *.* B:    Copies ALL files (indicated by *.*) to the
                        B: floppy drive.

       A>DISKCOPY A: B: 

       This is a variation of the copy command. The above example will
       copy the ENTIRE contents of the diskette in the A: drive to the
       B: drive. DISKCOPY.COM is an external file and must be available
       to be used! The COPY command is an internal command (always 
       resides in your computer's RAM memory and is thus ALWAYS 
       AVAILABLE - unlike DISKCOPY.COM)
       
       A>DISKCOPY A: A:

       This is a variation of the diskcopy command. The above example will
       copy the ENTIRE contents of the diskette in the A: drive to the
       A: drive for those using ONLY a single floppy drive system and
       perhaps not having a B: or C: drive. In essence, this variation
       copies the SOURCE diskette into memory, allows you to remove the
       SOURCE diskette, insert a blank formatted TARGET diskette and 
       transfer the files to that new floppy. Useful for those having only 
       a single floppy drive.

       C>COPY A:*.* B:

       Copies all files from A: to B: while still in the C: default
       directory.

       C>COPY A:HAPPY.DOC B:

       Copies only the file HAPPY.DOC to B:

       NOTE! DISKCOPY is an external command and must be on the disk
       or in the default directory to work. COPY is an internal command
       and is always available at the DOS command line. We mentioned 
       this before, but it is worth repeating . . . 

                                 TYPE COMMAND 

       Lets you view the internal contents of a file on the screen.
       If the file is in ASCII or english text (same thing) you will be 
       able to read it. If the file is not ASCII then you will see
       symbols which are gibberish. Only text or ASCII files are
       readable for the most part.

       Examples:

       C>TYPE MANUAL.DOC 

       Type the contents of the file MANUAL.DOC to the screen. Remember
       to use CTRL-S to pause, any key to resume scrolling and
       CTRL-S to pause again.

       A>TYPE B:MANUAL.DOC

       Type the file MANUAL.DOC which is located on the B: drive to the 
       screen.

                                 PRINT COMMAND

       There are actually two ways to print text or documentation files 
       on your printer.
       
       Examples:

       C>PRINT EXAMPLE.DOC

       Prints on your printer the contents of the file EXAMPLE.DOC.
       Note that PRINT command is an external file and must be present
       in the default drive to be used!

       C>TYPE EXAMPLE.DOC>PRN

       This is a useful alternative method of accomplishing the same 
       result by using the TYPE command which is an internal command, 
       always available and redirecting the output to a printer. The small
       > symbol is found as a shifted period mark on most keyboards
       and in other locations on your keyboard. Be sure to find and try 
       the > symbol. 

       NOTE! To stop printing use the CTRL-C key combination to stop the 
       printing and completely abort. CTRL-C works to abort just about 
       ANY DOS operation safely.


       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
                            COPYING THE MASTER DISK
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       Now that you know a little DOS, be aware that the first step to 
       accomplish with any disk of shareware is to copy your original 
       diskette onto another blank formatted floppy. Then work with the 
       copy and safely store the original just in case a problem 
       arises, a file is deleted, or you accidentally copy other files 
       over the shareware program diskette you need. It's a good idea to
       also put a write protect tab over the notch of the original disk
       before you use it so that data cannot accidentally be deleted.

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
                   THE DIRECTORY LISTING OF A SHAREWARE DISK
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       The next step is to use the DIR command to list the contents
       of a disk so you can do a little detective work and determine
       the disk contents and locate the instruction text files which 
       are probably contained on the disk.

       We have already given examples for listing a directory to the 
       screen in our previous DOS lesson. Another option is to print 
       the directory on your printer and carefully highlight or pencil 
       notes about the files on the paper which is a good idea for 
       beginners at first.

       Example for printing a directory of a disk onto paper:

       A>DIR B:>PRN

       Prints the directory of files on the B: floppy drive to your
       printer.

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

              FILE NAMES AND EXTENSIONS - THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       To the beginner, DOS is a little cryptic in its use of file 
       names. Study the example directory listing below and the
       notes to the right of the listing:

       PCPC     EXE    51489   5-03-86   3:36p   ---> PCPC.EXE          
       PCPR     EXE    21457   5-03-86   3:29p   ---> PCPR.EXE          
       PCPY     EXE    32017   5-03-86   3:39p   ---> PCPY.EXE          
       README            128   5-03-86  12:46p   ---> README
       NOTES565 TXT     1390   7-03-86   8:31a   ---> NOTES565.TXT
       
       In each case you will note the REAL file name to the right and 
       the directory listing version to the left. The point is that
       in DOS, filenames always have a name, a period or dot and an
       optional (but highly useful) extension. This is a very important 
       point!
       
                        KEYS TO THE SHAREWARE KINGDOM!

       Study the following list carefully, perhaps print it on paper 
       and mark it with a colored highlighter. This list contains a 
       roster of filename extensions which reveals the type of file and 
       its possible contents and application. 

             FILE EXTENSIONS WHICH PROBABLY CONTAIN DOCUMENTATION,
                         INSTRUCTIONS OR PRINTED TEXT

       .DOC       ---------> Probable DOCumentation file
       .TXT       ---------> Probable Text (TXT) file
       .MAN       ---------> Probable MANual/instruction file
       .LST       ---------> Probable file containing a LIST.
       .PRN       ---------> Probable text file from a PRINTED source.
       .INS       ---------> Probable INSTRUCTIONS in text form.
       .HLP       ---------> Probable HELP text file.
       .          ---------> NO, EXTENSION. VERY LIKELY A TEXT FILE!
       .HST       ---------> Probable text file containing HISTORY of
                             program revisions
       
             FILENAMES (WITH OR WITHOUT EXTENSIONS) WHICH PROBABLY
                     CONTAIN INSTRUCTIONS OR PRINTED TEXT

       README     ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
       READ.ME    ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
       READ.1ST   ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
       READ       ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
       READ.NOW   ---------> VERY IMPORTANT TEXT FILE
       
       NOTE! There are so many variations of the "READ..." theme that
       hopefully you can imagine other variations of this "READ..."
       concept!
       
       If you stop and think about it for a minute, most of these 
       extensions and filenames offer strong clues about file contents 
       and phonetically "hint" to you what the file contains. Here are 
       some examples you might actually see. Note the "clues" that tell 
       you text or instructions are available inside the file:

             1232XX.TXT            MAKE445.DOC       SYSOPS.       
             ASEASY.LST            MANUAL.TXT        READ.         
             DATABASE.DOC          MANUAL.           AUTHOR.       
             ENTIRE.MAN            FORMFEED.MAN      VENDOR.       
             MONEY.TXT             HOMEHELP.HLP      README.       
             README.!!!            HOMEHELP.LST      README.NOW   
             READSOON.             HOMEHELP.HST      VENDORS.      
             BBM.PRN               TRY44B.DOC        MANUAL.PRN   

                      OTHER IMPORTANT FILENAME EXTENSIONS

       .EXE       ---------> An EXECUTABLE FILE which starts program
       .COM       ---------> A COMMAND FILE which starts program
       .BAT       ---------> BATCH FILE which starts program
       .BAS       ---------> BASIC file which can be run with
                             the aid of the GWBASIC interpreter
                             GWBASIC which is normally on your DOS
                             disk or hard drive.

                    FILE EXTENSIONS WHICH INDICATE THE FILE 
         IS "COMPRESSED OR ARCHIVED" AND MUST BE UNPACKED PRIOR TO USE

       .ZIP       ---------> Compressed file, use PKUNZIP to unpack
       .ARC       ---------> Compressed file, use ARC 
       .PAK       ---------> Compressed file, use PAK
       .LZH       ---------> Compressed file, use LHARC
       .ZOO       ---------> Compressed file, use ZOO

                            OTHER USEFUL EXTENSIONS

       .BAK       --------->  A backup or duplicate file

       Some disk vendors try to help you by putting their own files 
       on a disk with a little extra information. The following file 
       examples might offer help in text or documentation form.
       An advanced shareware user would guess quickly that these files
       refer to a disk from a shareware vendor or computer club library
       and are most probably disk number 565 in a larger set of 
       programs that vendor or club offers in a library collection.

       If you buy a disk from a disk vendor named BEST VALUE SHAREWARE
       DISTRIBUTORS you might look for files such as the following 
       which also contain text, BAT, COM or other file startup information.
       
       Each vendor might use a different system, but watch for these 
       patterns as you list directory information on a shareware disk. 
       With the variety of methods, your best bet is to study filename 
       extensions for a few minutes and "play detective" which for some 
       folks is a bit of the interest in using shareware!

                  COM, EXE AND BAT FILES START PROGRAMS 
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       A file ending in EXE or COM is a file which contains a 
       EXECUTABLE OR "RUNNABLE" program and is a way to start a 
       software package. 
       
       Examples:

       To start PCF.EXE do this    PCF  (then press enter).  
       For DBFKK.EXE               DBFKK (then press enter.) 
       
       Some files which end in BAS will need a basic interpreter such 
       as GWBASIC.EXE to operate. Example files would be GAME.BAS or 
       MUSIC.BAS. GWBASIC.EXE is usually included on your DOS disk
       which came with the computer.
       
       Another standard of shareware programs is to use batch files to 
       start programs. GO.BAT or MENU.BAT or START.BAT or INSTALL.BAT 
       are "batch files." Simply type the first word at the prompt to 
       proceed.  
       
       Example: for file GO.BAT       GO (then press enter). 

       DOS searches a disk for programs to run in a precise order:

       HELLO.COM  ---------> Run this first if found then try 
       HELLO.EXE  ---------> to find and run this then
       HELLO.BAT  ---------> try to find and run this.
              
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
                               BASIC DATA FILES
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       If you find a BASIC program file which ends in .BAS try this
       per the following example . . .

       For the file HELLO.BAS, first copy both GWBASIC.EXE
       and HELLO.BAS to a blank formatted diskette. Then issue the 
       command:

       A>GWBASIC HELLO

       Another alternative is to leave GWBASIC.EXE on your hard drive 
       and tell it where the basic program is located. 

       Example:     C>GWBASIC A:HELLO

       The above example assumes a copy of GWBASIC.EXE resides on your 
       hard drive and a floppy containing the basic program HELLO.BAS 
       is on the A: drive.

       The program will be loaded into GWBASIC and run. If you
       don't care for the program, try to exit if the program gives
       you a menu of choices, otherwise press CTRL-BREAK keys
       at same time which will let GWBASIC exit. You will see an
       "OK" prompt. Type the word "system" and press the return/enter 
       key to return you to DOS and leave GWBASIC. 

       Basic is a rather elegant and precise programming system if you 
       are interested! Pick up a book at your local library and you can 
       learn how to use GWBASIC.EXE on your DOS disk to write and modify 
       your own elaborate custom programs! Also investigate the
       availability of affordable Basic compiler programs which prepare 
       speedy .EXE free standing programs rather than requiring you to 
       haul out your GWBASIC.EXE file each time you wish to run the 
       program.

       Try to puzzle through this pop quiz! Small stars next to the 
       filenames indicate an educated guess as to IMPORTANT TEXT 
       information or documentation contained within. These directory 
       lists are similar to what you might see on your screen when using 
       the DIR command when you first explore a new software disk. Brief 
       notes may follow each directory listing. 
       
       ** means high probability documentation is contained within
       *  means some documentation possibly is contained within

       64,512 bytes. Its size leads to strong suspicion it contains 
       the main documentation. Shorter files probably contain other 
       useful data. The two files at the bottom of the directory listing 
       make one suspect this disk in number 565 in a club library or 
       disk vendor collection. Sherlock Holmes would approve of our
       logic!

       This is a disk with several important documentation files, but
       a highly unusual second subdirectory! COMFILES <DIR> contains
       other file(s) and must ALSO be examined. The DOS CD or
       change directory command must be used to examine this other
       subdirectory or file storage area of the disk. See your DOS manual.
       Most shareware authors try to stay away from using additional
       subdirectories on a disk which can confuse a beginner. The file
       LASTMIN.ANN would tell an advanced shareware user that the file
       contains "last minute announcements" and is most probably 
       a text file. TUTR.DOC probably means "tutorial document."
       QUICK.DOC is probably quick startup documentation.

       This is an odd disk indeed. No documentation? Actually this
       is a special SELF-EXTRACTING file which is usually copied
       to a hard drive run with the command HM. The file will proceed 
       to unpack itself and produce several files containing 
       documentation, COM or EXE files and more! Most authors would
       include a small README file on the disk to advise you of this 
       fact, but this author has omitted even that! If you locate a 
       large EXE file, copy it to your hard drive (perhaps into
       a subdirectory named TEMP or temporary) and then run the
       file to cause it to unpack and produce all the little subfiles
       which are the main program! Shareware authors do this to 
       conserve disk space or otherwise compress large programs to
       fit onto fewer disks.

       READ1ST.EXE is run since it is a self-extracting EXE file which 
       probably produces documentation notes. The other three files are 
       probably self-extracting files which produce three separate 
       programs. This is a case of multiple self-extracting files! A 
       clever author is highly compressing his data to save space on 
       disk!

       Pop quiz part 2: Grab a few loose disks from any random source
       and repeat this detective process a few times and you will soon
       be a shareware GURU!

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
                           A TURBOCHARGED SHORTCUT!
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       There is always a shortcut to any process if you apply a little 
       thought and a bit of technology. As mentioned previously, you 
       need to identify files on a disk containing text or 
       instruction documentation and then view the contents of the 
       file. A previous section showed you how to use the DOS TYPE
       and PRINT commands to print the contents of a suspected text 
       file to either the screen or paper.

       If DOS commands and structure are not interesting or you don't 
       have the time to learn DOS, there exist programs called DOS 
       SHELLS which essentially provide DOS access for routine things 
       like moving and copying files AND QUICKLY VIEWING THE INTERNAL
       CONTENTS OF SUSPECTED TEXT FILES; these menu programs hide the 
       DOS commands behind a series of "point and select" choices 
       similar to the point and shoot menus you use on game programs 
       and serious business software. 
       
       The typical DOS shell is a package which surrounds DOS (like a 
       shell, hence the name) and allows you to perform the most common 
       DOS functions by pressing only one or two keys or moving a 
       highlighted arrow. Very appealing for beginners! This may be
       all the DOS control most people need . . .

       Some practical and easy DOS shell packages include: Still River 
       Shell, DOS2ools, PC Tools, Powermenu, Automenu, Dirmagic and 
       Directory Freedom. DR.COM and its companion shell programs
       CO.COM and RN.COM are extremely simple shells suited for
       beginners which most computer clubs and shareware disk vendors
       carry. The author of this package uses the Directory Freedom 
       shell which you may also wish to investigate.
       
       If you are beginner and don't want to be troubled learning DOS, 
       then a shell program is the easiest way to use the PC. And one 
       of the easier ways to view text files.
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

                           UNPACKING AND INSTALLING 
                      INCLUDING ARCS, ZIPS, LZH AND MORE

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       Many times a shareware package is quite large and has been 
       compressed or "archived" to fit on the disk. Another use for 
       archiving, or packing many files into one highly compressed 
       file, is to decrease telephone charges and time when transmitting 
       files by modem. In a previous section we indicated the following 
       filename extensions as pertaining to compressed or "archived" files:

       .ZIP       ---------> Compressed file, use PKUNZIP to unpack
       .ARC       ---------> Compressed file, use ARC system 
       .PAK       ---------> Compressed file, use PAK system
       .LZH       ---------> Compressed file, use LHARC
       .ZOO       ---------> Compressed file, use ZOO system

       Let's take a closer look. For example, the file FUN454.ZIP
       might contain the following files contained within the
       ZIP archive.
       
       FUNNELS  EXE                                         
       FUNNELS  DOC                                           
       FUNNELS  INV                                         
       ATC      DAT                                         
       FUNNELS  SCR                                         
       FUNNELS  TXT                            
       
       By the way, in the above example, FUN454.ZIP, we are given the
       probable clue that this might be Version 4.54 of the program.
       This is another odd but useful convention when dealing with
       the shareware community and archived or compressed files.

       In the shareware trade, one frequently hears the terms "ARCING, 
       ZIPPING, UNZIPPING, LHARCING, PAKING" and similar terms. You 
       can quickly understand that "archive processing" or compressing 
       and uncompressing disk files is what these terms refer to!

       Not all disks contain archives - some do, some don't. To unpack 
       the program you need a few blank floppies (or a hard drive) and 
       a special unpacking utility program to unpack. If your software 
       needs this utility, it is usually available on one (or several) of 
       your disks or can be ordered from most computer clubs or shareware 
       disk vendors. Here is how to unpack an archive file ending in 
       ZIP. Other files ending in .LZH, .ZOO and other file extensions
       are quite similar in use.
       
       Files which end in .ZIP are unpacked with PKUNZIP.EXE. For our 
       example let's pretend we are unpacking the file SAMPLE.ZIP. 
            
       Start with a BLANK formatted floppy. Copy the program file you 
       wish to unpack (e.g., SAMPLE.ZIP) and the file PKUNZIP.EXE 
       onto the blank floppy. Hard drive users may prefer to simply 
       copy the file to be unpacked and the unpacking utility 
       PKUNZIP.EXE to their hard drive. For our example, SAMPLE.ZIP and 
       PKUNZIP.EXE are now on a floppy in the A: drive.                     

       Next we need a place to put the unpacked files! For computers 
       without a hard drive put a blank formatted floppy in your other 
       empty B: floppy drive. This is where the unpacked newly expanded 
       files will go: the DESTINATION OR TARGET drive for the unpacked 
       software. Hard drive users will probably just unpack to the hard 
       drive (C:) using a subdirectory on the hard drive as the target 
       area.
                                                  
       Using the examples which follow, type an unpacking command 
       showing the source drive containing the packed file, the name of 
       file and the final destination drive; press enter or return key 
       after typing the unpacking command. Of course, substitute the 
       name of the file you are using for the file SAMPLE.ZIP. Blank 
       spaces in the command ARE essential. 

       EXAMPLE:             A>pkunzip A:SAMPLE.ZIP B: 

       Translation: unpack or unzip all files from the packed file 
       SAMPLE.ZIP contained on the A: floppy drive and send the 
       unpacked files to the B: floppy drive. Press enter or return key 
       after typing the command.

       EXAMPLE:             C>pkunzip C:sample.ZIP B: 

       Unpack files from C: hard drive area to a blank floppy on B: 
       drive. 

       By the way, you can omit the .ZIP file extension for a shortcut.

       EXAMPLE:               C>pkunzip C:sample B:

       Files are now unpacked and ready to use in the conventional 
       manner - after unpacking you will probably see the readme, text 
       and documentation files you need. The data is now in a more 
       familiar DOS file format. The archive can "inflate" more than 
       200% from its compressed format in some cases! 

       Some programs are very large and may be submitted to you in 
       several parts. You might find a program which consists of 
       three or four packed .ZIP, .LZH or other archive file(s) on 
       several disks.

       NOTE! for hard drive users you are usually wise to unpack each 
       program to a separate subdirectory on your hard disk. For 
       example, to use pcwrite you might unpack the files to C:\PCW. Of 
       course, you must first create a subdirectory called PCW on your 
       hard drive BEFORE you start. To prepare a subdirectory, use the 
       DOS md (make directory) command (example  c>md pcw.)  Hard drive 
       users might wish to delete the original compressed ARC/ZIP files 
       from their hard drive since the unpacked versions are now ready 
       and the original floppies serve as your backup copies.    

                    UNPACKING ARCHIVED/COMPRESSED PROGRAMS 
                 ON SINGLE FLOPPY SYSTEMS LACKING A HARD DRIVE
       
       A problem arises trying to uncompress archived programs on 
       single drive systems. Most computers have at least two drives. 
       
       On a single drive system you may need to uncompress your 
       programs to a special memory area of the computer called a RAM 
       DRIVE. Your DOS manual covers this option or you can obtain a 
       shareware package which produces a ram drive and thus allows 
       your computer to "think" it has two floppy drives. This is 
       about the only alternative for unpacking software on a single 
       drive machine. Generally single drive computers may not be fully 
       IBM compatible with many modern software packages which may need 
       two drives. Suggest you 1) return disks to vendor for refund or 2) 
       consider adding a second drive as most modern fully compatible 
       machines offer or 3) attempt unpacking with a RAM DRIVE then 
       copy back to disk. Later versions of DOS contain a RAM DRIVE
       program. You can also obtain RAM DRIVE programs from shareware
       and other software vendors.
  
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

                     CONFIGURING THE PROGRAM IF NECESSARY
  
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       Many times a software program must be configured prior to being
       actually used. This means that possibly screen colors, type of 
       disk drives, optional accessories such as a mouse or modem, 
       printer types and other features must be activated. Some 
       software programs allow you to configure this information 
       directly within the main program. Other programs prefer that
       you run a separate small "configuration" program first. 
       
       The only useful rule in this case is to read the documentation 
       or at least study the table of contents or index to see if 
       configuration is a necessary step.

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

                           TIME TO RUN THE PROGRAM!

       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 

       From a previous chapter of this tutorial we again offer the
       reminder that the following file extension relate to a file
       or program that can be run!


       .EXE       ---------> An EXECUTABLE FILE which starts program
       .COM       ---------> A COMMAND FILE which starts program
       .BAT       ---------> BATCH FILE which starts program
       .BAS       ---------> BASIC file which can be run with
                             the aid of the GWBASIC interpreter
                             GWBASIC which is normally on your DOS
                             disk or hard drive.

       Examples: 

       File is HMFAST.EXE. To start, assuming the file is on the C: 
       hard drive,

       C>HMFAST   <then press enter or return key>   starts program.

       File is ASEASY.COM. To start, assuming the file is on the A:
       floppy drive,

       A>ASEASY   <then press enter or return key>   starts program.

                FEEDBACK: EITHER REGISTER OR SEND YOUR REGRETS!
               
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
       
       The last step is probably the most important to a shareware 
       author and for that matter the continued production of ever more 
       interesting and useful shareware:

       Register the package if it proves truly useful. Send a 19 cent
       postcard to the author if you don't register with a few observations, 
       constructive criticisms or at least suggestions. The fact that 
       you were interested enough in the program to try it means that 
       it might be VERY close to what you need. Inexpensive postcard 
       feedback just might result in a program change by the author 
       which gives you a "perfect fit." You would be surprised how 
       responsive shareware authors are in revising a program QUICKLY 
       to meet a customer request. You might even say this is about 
       the closest thing to having your own personal programmer
       on the staff as you will ever find!

                         COMMON QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
       
       ---------------------------------------------------------------- 
      
             PROBLEMS USING COLOR SOFTWARE ON MONOCHROME COMPUTERS
       
       Some shareware programs (usually games and a few others) require 
       a color circuit within the computer called CGA, EGA or VGA 
       color graphics. If you start the program on a monochrome (no 
       color) computer you may see nothing on the screen! 
       
       Solutions: 1) Use an inexpensive software program (e.g., SIMCGA) 
       which helps monochrome machine pretend (emulate) color 2) Buy a 
       CGA, VGA or EGA circuit card 3) check the documents which come 
       with the shareware package to see if it can be switched from color 
       mode to monochrome. 

       Turn off your computer and restart it if you use a program such
       as SIMCGA or other software patch to help a monochrome computer
       emulate a color machine. You don't want the emulation program
       interfering with other software you may wish to run later.

       Problem: Computer responds with "bad command or filename."

       Solution: Make sure that what you typed at the DOS command line 
       is EXACTLY the filename you intended to run. This is probably a
       simple typing mistake.

       Problem: Program asks for a file which is not on the disk.

       Solution: Do you have ALL of the disks required. Have you 
       unpacked all archives? Have you run the configuration program
       which creates the missing file?

       Problem: Screen goes blank and machine locks up.

       Solution: Sounds like this is a color program trying to run on
       a monochrome system. See the notes above.

       Problem: Incorrect DOS version message.

       Solution: Many sophisticated programs cannot use older
       DOS versions such as 2.0 or 2.11. Check the documentation.
       There might be a way around this that the author suggests 
       towards the end of the program instructions.

       Problem: Only have one disk drive. 

       Solution: Refer to DOS manual or obtain separate standalone
       RAM disk software which can create a second drive in your 
       computer's RAM memory area. This is still a severe limitation
       and you are advised to at least purchase a second floppy drive
       which is not terribly expensive, these days.

       Problem: Author did not respond to my questions or send anything
       for my registration check. 

       Solution: Authors can move and change address. Contact a 
       shareware disk vendor, obtain the latest version of the program 
       and see if the address of the author has changed. Call or write 
       again.

       Problem: I want to know more about shareware!

       Solution: Explore the following . . .
