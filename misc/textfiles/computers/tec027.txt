Subject: I Stacked my PS/1 before I reconfigured the way it starts.
         Now what?

Note:  If Stacker has not yet been installed, see Tech020: INSTALLING
STACKER ON AN IBM PS/1.

BACKGROUND:  
The PS/1 is a ROM based machine.  It normally boots from its 
"Built-In-DOS" on the ROM D: drive and  reads config.sys and Autoexec.bat 
from there as well.  The PS/1 can be reconfigured, using"CUSTOMIZE", 
to read Config.sys and Autoexec.bat from C: so that the Stacker devices 
may be loaded.  If the boot process is not "CUSTOMIZed" before loading 
Stacker, the data may appear to be "missing" because the STACKER.COM device 
has not been loaded.

A 4 Quadrant system menu is normally loaded from ROM upon boot. It consists 
of 1.Information 2.Microsoft works 3. Your software and 4. IBM DOS.  You can 
shell to a DOS prompt by pressing <shift F9>. It is installed in Config.sys: 
"INSTALL=D:\SHELLSTB.COM".

"CUSTOMIZE How System Starts" is a program normally in the C:\DOS directory,
but is copied into the Stacker drive upon "STACKING... the existing drive".
The program also should be on the DOS diskettes that came with the
machine.  In the Customize program you can configure the computer to
Read the system files, Config.sys, and Autoexec.bat  from C: or D:
Note: THE CUSTOMIZE DEFAULTS CAN BE RESTORED BY POWERING DOWN THE
SYSTEM, HOLDING DOWN THE 2 MOUSE BUTTONS, AND POWERING BACK UP.

RECOVERY:
Note:   You MUST have the DOS program diskette containing CUSTOMIZ.EXE
or a bootable floppy to proceed.  Nothing can be done until you have
one of these!

If you have the DOS program diskette:
1. Insert the DOS diskette in A: and Run the CUSTOMIZE program from the
   Dos Quadrant.  (You can also <shift> F9 to get to a prompt and run 
   A:Customiz.)

If you do not have the DOS diskette but have a bootable system
diskette:
1. Insert the system diskette in A: and from the system menu press
   Alt+SysRq to force the system to boot from A: (the D: Rom drive 
   will not be accessible after this.)
2. Copy config.sys to A: and reboot
3. From the DOS directory on the Stacker drive (C:) run CUSTOMIZ.

Running CUSTOMIZE:
1. The third line from the bottom of the screen says "Read
   Config.sys:". Click on "from Disk"
2. The next line down says " Read Autoexec.bat". Click on "From Disk"
3. The last line says "Disk to Read from". Click on C:
4. Press <ENTER> to save changes and exit.
5. Reboot the machine.
6. This will bring you to a C: prompt.  Edit the Config.sys on C:\ and
   add the line:
      Install=D:\SHELLSTB.COM to restore the system Quadrant menu.
7. Restart the system for changes to take affect.
