                                      Chapter 1                            
                              How to read this catalog

          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.

          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
          for you -- the user -- to decide.  Shareware, especially those
          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)


          1.1  Minimum requirements

          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:

             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA" com-
                         puters, plus higher resolution monitors such as
                         the EGA or VGA.  Some of the described programs
                         may operate correctly with a Hercules monitor if
                         you use a "CGA simulator" program; consult your
                         video monitor manual for details.
             Dual 720k drives
                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
                         hard disk (see below).
             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
             Hard disk   A fixed-, removeable-, or network-drive device
                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.

             Hercules monitor
                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
                         graphics.  CGA monitors won't suffice.
             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
                         may require a LaserJet either starting with a
                         specific model such as the LaserJet II or having a
                         specific feature like the LaserJet IIIDSi.
             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes"
                         modem, specifically one able to recognize the
                         Hayes command set (an industry standard).  A few
                         programs claim to work with non-Hayes modems too.
                         Some programs may require the modem to operate at
                         a specific rate of speed (e.g. "1200 baud").
             Mouse       A mouse.
             Network     A computer hooked up a local area network (LAN)
                         system.  Program descriptions will normally
                         specify the different types of LAN systems under
                         which they can operate.
             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described
                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL
                         (Hewlett Packard Graphics Language) command set.
             PostScript printer
                         A printer able to interpret the PostScript(r)
                         command set.  Many printers (including the HP
                         LaserJet series) offer PostScript compatibility
                         via plug-in cartridges.
             VGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying VGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes super-VGA
                         and other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA/EGA/
                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
             SVGA monitor
                         A video monitor capable of displaying Super-VGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
                         resolution monitors.  CGA/EGA/VGA/Hercules
                         monitors won't suffice.


          1.2  Registration benefits

          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
          months.

          ASP Catalog for BBS Users                                       5



          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
          appropriate.

          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
          registered customers:

             CompuServe
             IntroPak    obtain an introductory membership to the Compu-
                         Serve network with a $15 usage credit when you
                         register an ASP member's shareware product.
             Shareware
             Magazine    get a discount when you subscribe to Shareware
                         Magazine.

          Many authors include this information when they acknowledge
          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.

          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
          reminders, once you register the product.


          1.3  Sample product description

          This sample description will help you understand what each field
          means:

          Product:  Shareware Program Name                            [***]
            A "[***]" across from the product name indicates a new or
            updated description since the last catalog.
          Author:  name & phone number of the person or company offering
            this product.  See Appendix A for detailed information about
            the person or company.
          Needs:  computer type [IBM PC, IBM 80386, MacIntosh, etc.],
            operating system, and version number.  May also describe other
            needed or optional hardware & software.  See above for more
            details.
          Registration:  The cost of a single user license, expressed in
            U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.  Many authors provide
            "multi-tier" registrations, and you may pay a little more or
            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
            (You can sometimes save money by "reading the fine print.")
            Some authors don't include shipping & handling fees in their
            prices.  Most authors offer network, site, and corporate

            licenses; please contact the author for specific details and
            price quotes.
          Version:  version number  (release date)
          User benefits:  Describes the benefits you get for registering
            the software.  All ASP shareware programs come with certain
            minimum benefits; see above for details.
          Look for:  FILENAME.EXT  (call xxx-xxx-xxxx to download it at no
            charge); FNAME.EXT in GATE:FORUM forum LIB 9 on CompuServe;
            FILENAME.EXT in ROUNDTABLE RTC LIB 9 on GEnie.
          Download size:  the size of the file(s) to download, in
            kilobytes.  A 2400 baud modem can download about 14 kilobytes
            per minute under normal conditions.
          Special instructions:  tells if the author limits product
            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
            or company from distributing the product in other countries.
          Description:  a paragraph or two of text which describes the
            shareware product in detail.  This information comes direct
            from the author or company behind the program.
          Editor's note:  the catalog editor may append text of his own if
            something needs further explanation.

          Description:
            Offload is a new concept. It is not a general purpose archive
            such as PKZIP. OffLoad and its associated utilities allow you
            to identify files that really do not need to be on your hard
            disk, compress them and move them off to floppies. It maintains
            a catalog to allow you to track and restore any file from the
            archive automatically. Think of it as file manager, archiver,
            and disk cataloger all in one. It will let you free up hard
            disk space and maintain control of your files.

            very small -- requiring less than 700 bytes of DOS memory. Of
            course, the RAM Disk takes up as much memory as you configure
            it to.

          Description:
            A Windows batch language interpreter which brings the power of
            batch language programming to the Windows environment. Can do
            pretty much everything the old DOS batch files can do, but it
            goes far beyond the capabilities of the DOS batch language.
            Can run Windows and DOS programs, send keystrokes to Window
            applications, prompt users for input using an assortment of
            dialog boxes, make branching decisions, and much more.

            Designed to provide employers and employees with a quick, easy
            to use expense account screen/report that will eliminate the
            necessity of keeping a supply of expense report forms and doing
            all the arithmetic involved in preparing the report.  Because
            reports are stored on disk, the employee copy of the report
            becomes unnecessary.

            key to ensure uniqueness before reading a record (if you have
            only one customer whose name starts with Z, you get the record
            as soon as you type Z). Any number of files may be opened, and
            each may have up to 10 multi-field keys. Many other features.

            training. This PC kit might be used to help individuals handle
            tough decisions; to nurture a sense of conscience in the
            organization; to use the PC as a host for your unique company

            This cutie ties up your computer with a Very Important (but
            imaginary) task so you can take a break. When you start Hard At
            Work, it selects one of 7 routines at random. You can pick your
            favorite job by pressing the appropriate function key. The
            activity on screen looks too important to be interrupted. If
            someone tries to stop the action with ESC or CTRL-C, a DANGER
            message pops up, and a tone alerts you. The process continues
            until you want to stop it.

          Description:
            A crazy exercise, with a mouse or joystick, in which you must
            spin a web to catch all of the flies before they over-populate.
            The most effective web, although you can make it anyway you
            want, looks like the ones a real garden spider spins.  The best
            scores are achieved by keeping the number of flies trimmed to a
            small number and playing for as long as possible.  Webs can
            also be spun with just the cursor keys.

          Description:
            In this colorful maze game, you are a ghost who can walk
            through walls matching the colors of the magic keys you can
            collect.  At first, all of the walls are solid.  Pressing the
            "SPIN" key makes the corners of the walls spin at random, to
            open different doorways.  Each spin costs one of the gems you
            must collect.  Bumping solid walls or knocking over paint cans
            costs extra points.  The object is to maneuver through the
            maze, collect keys and gems, and get to the winners circle in
            the fewest steps.

            game that pits the player against the clock. Tile contents may
            be set to numbers, letters or colors for matching. Mouse or
            keyboard control is provided.

            The game was originally written because there are so few PC
            games that our five year old could play without help. Kids do
            really well! As for adults - the name says it all.

            comes into a square, it takes that color.  If two colors come
            in, they cancel and the square assumes the third color. Each
            time you change a square, all squares in the pattern are
            recalculated and redrawn. change puzzles and display

            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on

                                   About shareware


          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals

            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
            information clearing house for its members and the public at
            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
            committed to the shareware concept.

            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
            any other benefits they offer.

            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.

            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens -- authors have been kicked
            out because of repeated complaints.

            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
            word.

            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
            Association secretary.

            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,
            Muskegon, MI 49442.  If you have a modem and a CompuServe

                                  Retired shareware

            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
            tion fees sent in for the software.

            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
            competition from other authors.

                                      Appendix E                           
                             Sorted list of all programs

            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
            know the current version number/release date for a program.
            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
            address & phone number.  You'll find page references to all the
            information you need.
