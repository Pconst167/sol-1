       DOS 6 has greatly improved help information.  To get a short
       explanation and overview of DOS commands, at the DOS prompt
       type:
                           fasthelp <ENTER>
       
       If you want to access a table of contents for DOS HELP, at the
       DOS prompt type:
       
                           help <ENTER>
       
       Then press the first letter of the command on which you would
       like more information.  Use your arrow keys to make your
       selection.  When the cursor is on the command where you want
       help, press:
       
                           <ENTER>
       
       To get detailed information on any particular DOS command, at
       the system prompt type HELP followed by a space and the
       command that you want information on.  For example, if you want
       help on the DIR command, type:
        
                           help dir <ENTER>
       
       A screen of information is shown with Notes and Examples at the
       top.  Press N for Notes or E for Examples.  The cursor will then
       go to the one you selected.  Then press:
       
                           <ENTER>
       
       You can use your arrow keys to scroll through the text.  You can
       also press <PGDN> or <PGUP> to scroll one page at a time. 
       If you select E for Examples, you are shown actual examples of
       how to use the command. If you want to search for a key word or
       phrase, you can start the search process by pressing:
       
                           <ALT> 
                           s
       
       Then just follow the screen prompts.
       

                        Printing HELP Information
       
       You can print the HELP information you are viewing by pressing:
       
                           <ALT>
                           f
                           p
                           <ENTER>
                 
       I recommend printing the help information, so you can have a
       copy to use beside your computer.  If you do this for all the DOS
       commands, you can print your own personalized DOS manual!  
       

       
                   HELP with Other Commands
       
       While you are using the DOS HELP, you can get a table of
       contents of all the covered commands by pressing:
       
                           <ALT> 
                           c
       
       
       Anytime you are using DOS HELP and want assistance on how to
       get around in HELP, press the function key labeled:
       
                           <F1>
       
       
                    Getting Out of HELP
       
       To get out of HELP and return to the DOS prompt, type:
       
                           <ALT>
                           f
                           x
