Ok basically uSu Script format is pretty simple and will do alot if you take
the time to work it through. Ok here we go...

1.1.1 - The ANSI:      Command
1.1.2 - The PAUSE:     Command
1.1.3 - The DISPLAY:   Command
1.1.4 - The SETxx:     Command

1.1.B - The JMPx:      Command 

1.2.1 - The Color Codes/Keycodes

1.0.1 - The First Line of a script
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
<Application Description>

Purpose:This first line of the Script file(any file with .SCR) tells the 
        application generator the description for this Application, and must
        be the first line, otherwise you'll get wierd undesired results, limit
        40 chars

Example -
This is a Test application

What's Done:This information is used for the highlight bar

1.0.2 - The Second Line of a script
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
OUTFILE:<Output.Nam>

Purpose:This Second line of the Script file tell the application generator
        what file the output text should be written to, make sure this is 
        allways the second line in your Script file you you'll get wierd
        undesired results.

Example -
OUTFILE:WRITE2ME.OUT

What's Done:The filename provided here will be written to whenever INPUT: is
            used.

1.1.1 - The ANSI:      Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
ANSI:<Filename.Ext>

Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
        script, where <Filename.Ext> is the Ansi file you wish to display

Example -
ANSI:TEST.ANS

What's Done:This will display the ansi file named TEST.ANS to the user

1.1.2 - The PAUSE:     Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
PAUSE:<String>

Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
        script, where <String> is your pause string. This command will display
        your pause string and the wait for the user to press any key to 
        continue, all codes are supported(Section 1.2.1)

Example -
PAUSE:Press Any Key to Continue

What's Done:This will display "Press Any Key to Continue" to the user and
            wait for him to press a key

1.1.3 - The DISPLAY:   Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
DISPLAY:<String>

Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
        script, where <String> is what you wan't to display on the screen.
        All codes are supported(Section 1.2.1)

Example -
DISPLAY:Show this text to the user

What's Done:The example above will print out to the user "Show this text to
            the user" to the screen

1.1.4 - The SETxx: Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
SETxx:<String>

Purpose:This command defines a macro(@xx, xx= 01-99), where 'x' in SETx is a 
        the macro number you wish to set. Thus @xx in a DISPLAY: command
        will display macro #xx(where xx is - 01-99) on the screen it you have
        set it. All other codes are supported(Section 1.2.1) for the <String>
        part of the command. This helps save typing and makes the application
        generator more flexibal.

Example(s) -
SET01:Hello there #1
SET02:Hello there #2                
...
SET99:Hello there #99!!!

DISPLAY:@01@02@99
What's Done:What's done here is defining a macro, so you may print out text
            that's commonly used quicker without having to type it over and
            over again. Thus when you use a DISPLAY: command you'll see whats
            been put into the macro's appear inplace of the @01, @02, etc...
            NOTE:YOU MAY DISPLAY ANOTHER MACRO FROM A MACRO. See Below

Example(s) -
SET01:Hello 1
SET02:Hello 2
SET03:@01@02

What's Done:Here we defined a macro to print out other macro's. When you use
            a display command to display macro 3, @03, you'll see both macros
            1 and 2, like so

Hello 1Hello 2

1.1.5 - The INPUT:     Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
INPUT:xx:<Write to App File>;<String>

Purpose:This command may be placed anywhere after the first two lines of a
        script, where xx is a number between 01 to 80(make sure there are two
        spaces for the vaule you specify, this will keep the program from 
        getting confused) that limit the input lenght. Where <Write to App
        File> is the text you want in the output app file, this string must be
        seperated by a Semi-Colon to make sure the program determines between
        <Write to App File> and <String>. Where <String> is the text you wan't
        displayed before input begins, All codes supported for this string
        (Section 1.2.1)

Example -
INPUT:09:This user's handle:;Please enter in your handle:

What's Done:This is print to the screen...

Please enter in your handle:

...and will limit the user's input to 9 charecters and save this to the
output text-file with...

This user's handle:

...before the input the user types in, then whatever the user typed in will be
save after this information.

1.1.6 - The END:       Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
END:

Purpose:The main purpose of this feature is to tell the application generator
where to stop in the srcipt, if you ommit this statement at the end of the
script that's fine to, because the script generator will automatically force
this END: statement when exucting it and reaching the last line in the script
file, you can however use this to debug your scripts by placeing it so it'll
stop at different points in the script(for debuggsing purposes mostly)

Example:
END:

What's Done:Heh. just end's the program

1.1.7 - The RUNAPP:    Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
RUNAPP:<AppName>

Purpose:The main purpose of this command is to allow you to run other 
        applications, this allows you the user to design you own highlight
        bar system by writing the script for it.

Example:
RUNAPP:Ansi.App

What's Done:Ansi.App is looked for and if it's found it will be executed if
            it's not found the application Generator will notify you.

1.1.8 - The GOTO:      Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
RUNAPP:<LabelName>

Purpose:Well this was put in by popular demand, where <LabelName> is the
        label you would like the continuing of the application to occur, a
        label is named by putting a ':' before the name of the label

                Example - 
                        :THISLABEL
        Labels can be any lenght, and are not case sensitive, it is possible
        to have two labels with the same, but in different case, 

                Example - 
                        :THISLABEL
                        :thislabel

        The application Generator treats these as two seperate labels. Using
        the same labels isn't advised...

                Example -
                        :THISLABEL
                        :THISLABEL

        The Application Generator just searchs for the first labelname that
        matches the one you told it to go to, above the second :THISLABEL
        would never be executed.

Example:
GOTO:START-THIS-APP
:START-THIS-APP

What's Done:The application Generator will jump to the First label matching
            START-THIS-APP, and continue running the application from that
            line.

1.1.9 - The CHCx: Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
CHCxx:<String>

Purpose:This command defines what ASK:(See ASK:     Command) should display 
        when the use highlights this choice, you may even use the
        @DA<Ansi-FileName>% Command for the <String> portion to display an
        ansi instead of typing in the choice yourself. You can now make the
        Maxtrix look any way you wan't it to. You can also use all the other
        codes to locate the row, column, set the foreground and background
        color codes (Section 1.2.1)

Example(s) -
CHC1:Option #1
CHC2:Option #2
...
CHC9:Option #2

ASK:9

What's Done:What going on here is that you have defined the options to use
            when you use the ASK command to allow the user to choose an
            item and then press enter on it(See Section 1.1.A)

1.1.A - The ASK: Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
ASK:x

Purpose:This command allows the user to press the UP and DOWN arrow keys and
        highlight a Option and then press enter to choose that option. where
        the 'x' is let's ask know how many choices(from 1 to 9) to allow the
        user to select.

Example(s) -
ASK:5

What's Done:What will happen is that ASK will wait for the user to highlight
            and choose(press enter on) the option you wan't, the with the
            JMPx:<LabelName> command allows the program to jump to
            <LabelName> if choice 'x' was choosen, see example for JMPx

1.1.B - The JMPx: Command
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Format -
JMPx:<LabelName>

Purpose:After a ASK:x command has been executed a vaule is returned of what
        option they choose, then JMPx:<LabelName> allows your script to
        branch out to different choices. IE...

Example(s) -
ASK:4
JMP1:Option1
JMP2:Option2
JMP3:Option3
JMP4:Option4

What's Done:What will happen here is after ASK has executed a vaule will be
            returned, ASK was limited to 4 choices, so depending on what
            choice the USER choose the script will GOTO another part of
            the program according to the Option choosen. So say i choose
            option 2 when ASK was run, the program would goto Label Option2
            and continue executing the script from there. This is handy for
            making your own lightbar selection for Applications.

@CR - Carriage, will go to the next line and set cursor in column 1
@CL - Will clear the current screen
@LS - This will save the current Row and Position.
@LL - This will restore the last save Row and Column
@LRxx - where XX is a number between 01-25, locate's that row on the screen
@LCxx - where XX is a number between 01-80, locate's that column on the screen
@SDxx - where XX is a number between 01-99, delay's xx/100 th's of a second
@SBxx - where XX is a number between 01-80, backspace xx number of spaces
@DA<FileName>% - Displays <Filename> may also be an ANSI file, but make sure
                        the '%' is after the filename so the program know
                        what the last charecter of the filename is.

RUNAPP:<Filename>    
GOTO:<Labelname>
SETx:<Macro-String>
