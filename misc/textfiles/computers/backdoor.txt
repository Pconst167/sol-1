February 20 1989


This is  BACKDOR1.arc   ... the first in a series of 
"back doors" to various games.  The source of this info is
various magazines, and I have paraphrased the articles.

Note that "back door" refers NOT to regular game hints on
how to play better, but to a way to CHEAT, usually put
there by the programmer, sometimes caused by a bug.  Usually
you'll be made invincible if it's an arcade-type game, or 
be able to advance quicker if an adventure game. 

Most of these "back door" and "side door" hints are out of
a GREAT magazine for the Amiga, C64, and C128:  INFO.
It's a grass-roots, down to earth magazine - the first
magazine about personal computers to be be entirely done on
personal computers.  That's "Where It's At".  

You owe it to yourself to subscribe to INFO.
With the exception of most of the ads, everything including
color screen shots and photos are digitally created, edited,
composed, printed, and color separated as complete assembled
pages on 14 Amiga computers running Professional Page (and
many many other Amiga software products), and output to a
Linotronic L300 typesetting device at 1235 dots per inch!
INFO doesn't cover programming techniques, but in my opinion
it out-shines all the other Commodore mags for news, honest
opinion, game reviews, and reviews of all C= software.

ALL GAMES:  connect a genlock to the Amiga and leave it on
while playing games, and they'll play 25% slower, which
allows you to score high. 



ARKANOID

Get into the back door this way:  boot and run the game as
usual, then select a start screen and begin game.  Press the
space bar to pause, and type in  DSIMAGIC  (no spaces, and 
don't press Return).  Press the space bar to unpause.

Now a yellow Power capsule named  DS  will fall down.  Catch
it.  Now you can get any power capsule you want any time.
Press the first letter of the capsule you want, and it will
fall down for you to catch: 
  Break  Catch  Disruption  Expand  Laser  Player  Slow
Catch some Player capsules first to get extra lives.

You can also use two capsules at the same time, like Disrupt
the ball into three balls, and use Lasers also.

Pressing the  F  key will send you to the Finsl screen where
you fight DOH, the Dominion Over Hour monster on the cover
 of the package.  You'll need lots of lives first.

Skip over any screen by pressing  Enter  on the keypad, or 
get through the screen fast (with points too) using a Break
capsule.



ARKANOID II

On the high score screen, type in the name  DEBBIE S  
(with the space), and you'll have infinite lives.  



BARBARIAN

Boot and run the game as usual, but at some point after the
game has started, type in:  04-08-59   ...It will make the
Barbarian character almost invincible, but he can still be
killed by very high falls, and by the flame-hurling horned
demon in the dungeon deep, pictured on the cover.

After you type  04-08-59  the screen will turn gray, telling
you that you're invincible.

Once you make it to Necron, you must have a shield.  Face 
Necron when he turns to face you.  When he throws a fireball
at you, press the defense button as it hits your shield.



BARD'S TALE

How to hoard millions in gold without trying:  Load your
party, go to the stats screen for the first player.  Pool
all of the party's gold to the first player, then remove
him from the party, then load him back in.  Then pool the
gold to another player.  Repeat this for each player.

Then turn off the computer without saving the game.  Reboot
and ezch player will have gold equal to the TOTAL the party
had before.  Repeat if you're really greedy !



BETTER DEAD THAN ALIEN

If you are just about to be hit by an alien or a bomb, press
the ESC key to pause, move your ship out of the way, then
press  N  to resume the action.

Type  CHAMP  on the options screen, then press the  HELP
key.  You'll be shown a list of cheat keys.



CAPONE

To find the "special bonus", go to the front of the Post
Office.  Shoot the ball at the top of the flag pole, and 
your score will go way up.  If you shoot it again, you'll
see a screen of the programmers!  Shoot again and you'll be
invincible, standing in the bank.  At the end of that round,
you will start at the beginning, except you'll be in warp
speed.



DEFENDER OF THE CROWN

To get 1,024 Knights:  After conquering a territory, press
these four keys at the same time, while the drive is still 
running:  H J K L  ... If you do it just right, you'll have
1,024 knights both in your home and in your army.  Hey, this
is good stuff!

Another way was reported in which to get 1,024 Knights, but
it doesn't seem to work:  After first picking the knight,
when Robin Hood appears, type PATTERSON over and over until
the map of England appears.  Don't press the Return key.  
If this trick doesn't work the first time, try again.  
I was only able to get this to work most of the time if,
before typing  PATTERSON  over and over, I first typed in
my name with no spaces:  GEORGEKNOCHEL   Yep, Twilight Zone!

Another good trick for Defender of the Crown, for sword
fighting, is to get the PD program called FUN-BUT
(fun button), which when run lets you press the F1 key
continuously instead of clicking on the mouse.
(but then this is a hint, not a back door).



DRAGON'S LAIR

This will demo the ENTIRE game (about 18 minutes worth or a
disk I/O error, whichever comes first).  You can't play it,
just watch the whole game:  After the credits have finished
loading, and are being displayed (the red light will still
be on, but no loading is occurring), press the following six
(6) keys, simultaneously:   <ESC> R / L N 7   
Yes, all at the same time (use your nose if ya have to -
just press ESC and hold, then press R and hold, etc.). 
The screen will flash if you did it right.  THEN PRESS THE
FIRE BUTTON on your joystick.  Sit back and watch all the
animation.  (I couldn't - my disk 5 had an I/O error)



DUNGEON MASTER

To advance Ninjas a level, stand in a hall and throw all
your weapons, then get them and repeat.  This also works
with magic and Fighter levels:  cast a spell at the air,
or slash and bash until you gain a level.



F/A-18 INTERCEPTOR

Select option "2 Free Flight, no enemy confrontation" from
the main menu.  Then select zero instead of 1 to 4.  The
screen will go into a spiral and scroll way south to 34 by
117 degrees, placing your plane somewhere without a runway.
To take off you have to use the afterburners.  117 degrees
is the furthest south you'll be able to fly, but you can go
in other directions.  (Is there more to this back door? hmm)



FAERY TALE ADVENTURE

Sometimes you can accumulate all the treasure you want by
going near the item, press space bar, and keep pressing 'T'.
You'll receive an infinite supply of that treasure.

Save your position in a dungeon.  Then go through it until
you don't have anymore keys.  Restore your position.  All 
doors already opened will still be open, and you'll have a
new supply of keys.  Repeat if needed.  Also works in cave.

Jump on the turtle and start slashing.  Your bravery points
will go up to infinity, but doesn't hurt the turtle or you.

On the island with the Crystal Castle, press the right mouse
button while talking to the Sorceress and your luck will go
to 65.  "Ask"ing the Sorceress several times will normally
boost your luck.

If running low on green keys, use a secret entrance for the
fort - it is on the left side, almost even with the door.


HYBRIS

Boot game and don't do anything until the high scores screen
appears.  Then type COMMANDER and click the fire button.
When it starts, wait a few moments and press the F10 key.
If the extensions of your ship get flickery or glimmer,
you're now invincible and have unlimited expansions and
smart bombs.  Get to the other 6 levels of expansions by
pressing F1 through F5 when you're in unexpanded mode, or
capture the special "capsules" in the usual way.  Move to 
other game levels (there are three) with the F8 key, and
turn invincibility off or on with the F10 key.  No High
scores are collected when you're invincible.



KARATE KID II

Press the  P  key in single player mode to be taken to the
next screen.  You can go as far as the Final Encounter.  In
2-player mode, you can go to the next-to-the-last screen.



LEISURE SUIT LARRY

Press ALT and X at the same time to bypass the proof-of-age
questions.



STARGLIDER  (not Starglider II):

Boot and play as usual until launched and ready to do
battle.  Then slow down until completely stopped in 
space.  Press the F1 key to turn on the fixed sight, and
press the backspace key to pause the game.  Now type:
    js[space]arg[space]s     You should now be invincible!
You'll know you're in invincible mode when you can
repeatedly press the  P  key and get additional missiles (up
to 9).  If the password didn't take the first time, try
again.  To may have to dock and re-exit for it to work.
Once invincible, your fuel will remain constant and shields
will never be depleted.

Also, a secret built-in 3D object viewer running in the 
background is available by pressing the  z  key once you've
entered the invincible mode.  Use the keyboard to pause [p],
select [, and .] and manipulate objects - use all keys
except q and ESC.  Use the mouse to change point of view
and magnification and hold down the right button.  ....



STARGLIDER II

Once the game has started, press  F  for fixed sights and
then slow the ship to a halt.  Press BACKSPACE to pause, and
type the words:  WERE ON A MISSION FROM GOD      (really!)
(The article did not have the apostrophe  '  in We're ...)

Then press  1  (one) on the keyboard (not keypad).  Your
shield and energy levels will drop to a fixed point.  Press
the letter  K  to get all the weapons in the game, including
the neutron bomb.  If you run low on weapons, you can get
them all back by repeating the process.  Onward into battle,
young soldiers!



SWORD OF SODAN

Type  NANCY  then press RETURN on the high scores screen for
unlimited lives!



TEST DRIVE

Holding down the joystick button while going around curves
prevents you from hitting the wall or going off the cliff.



THREE STOOGES

To really slow down "the hand" which selects the scenes, do
the slapping game and pull Curly's ear: pull it continuously
until the time runs out. 



XENON

Let yourself be killed off at the beginning of the 2nd stage
of the 2nd level, and all aliens in the round are destroyed.



Press [ENTER] to continue...
