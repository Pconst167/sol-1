ARson (a publication of The Estranged Youth Society) is just full of a 
bunch of anti-authority stuff. issue #1 contains: pranks to play on the 
church, mail terrorism, 101 ways to kill your parents with an axe, and 
more. There's also some cool humor, like the mineral water review and 
night of the living sea mon. Reviewed by: Storm Shadow on 03/02/93 @
