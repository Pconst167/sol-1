This procedure is for Stacker 2.0 users with a single partition C: drive 
and the ability to transfer files from a second "host" computer with 
floppy drive to the notebook. 
   
Procedure:

 1. Create a STACKER directory on the C: drive of the notebook.

 2. Transfer the STACKER files from the host computer to the STACKER 
    directory on the notebook.

 3. Edit the Autoexec.bat on the notebook's C drive and add ;C:\STACKER
    to the path.

 4. Change to the STACKER directory on the C: drive.

 5. Type the following:     INSTALL /=F
    This will personalize the STACKER files.  When you get to the point
    where install wants you to insert a disk, escape out of install and
    exit.
 
 6. Type the following:     INSTALL 

 7. During install, you want to "Build an empty STACKER drive"
    The amount to use for the Stacker drive is 1 MB.

 8. Reboot the notebook to mount the empty drive D. 

 9. Copy the Stacker files from C:\STACKER to D:\ 

10. Type D:\Install

    drive has been created.  Change to C:\STACKER  

14. Type :      SREMOVE D: 
    This will remove the temporary D: drive.

15. Edit the Config.sys on drive C: to remove the reference to 
    the temporary D drive. The line should read as follows: 
       DEVICE=C:\STACKER\STACKER.COM C:\STACVOL.DSK

16. Reboot.  Your hardisk is now "Stacked".
