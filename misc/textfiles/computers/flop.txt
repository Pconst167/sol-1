          There are a few things you should know before you use
          DoubleSpace on floppy disks.
          
          1.   You can't use DoubleSpace unless you have installed it on
               your computer. 
          
          2.   The floppy disk needs to have at least .65 Megabytes
               (665K) of free space.  This means you cannot use 360K,
               5¬" diskettes.  Change to the appropriate drive, and use
               the CHKDSK command to check the capacity of a diskette. 
               
          3.   If you plan to share data with someone else, they will not
               be able to read a DoubleSpaced diskette unless they are
               using DoubleSpace on their computer.
          
          4.   Before you can use a DoubleSpaced diskette, you will need
               to MOUNT it.  This is not as painful as it sounds.
          
          5.   DOS will create a new drive where it will store information
               about this compressed floppy disk.  It does this in the same
               fashion as it did when compressing a hard drive.  
          
          
                    COMPRESSING A FLOPPY DISK
          
          Make sure you read items 1-4 above.  Then, to compress a floppy
          disk, do the following:
          
          1.   Place a formatted floppy disk in the drive of your choice.
          
          2.   If you want to compress a diskette in your A drive, type
               the following:
          
                         dblspace /compress a: <ENTER>
          
               A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /COMPRESS A: command
               is:
                    
                         dblspace /com a: <ENTER>
          
               Change to the newly DoubleSpaced floppy:
          
                         a: <ENTER>
          
               Then type:
          
                         dblspace /info <ENTER> 
          
                A shortcut for the DBLSPACE /INFO command is:
          
                         dblspace /i <ENTER>
          
          If you restart your computer or change floppy diskettes, you will
          need to MOUNT the floppy disk before it can be used.
