Do you know the terror of

                               ARQ-FLASHING ?

I am sure you know....

I have to admit that my method cant remove line-noise but the most
ARQ-Discos are not caused by a bad line but by a slow retrain of the HST.

You start the upload and the first thing happening is: CS-led off and the
ARQ-led is flashing. (I know you cry "Yes, yes") Ok normaly it will take
a long time to finish flashing or it will never finish. What can I do
against this? Its pretty simple: Try to keep your computer away from 
sending (just as long as the ARQ is flashing).
How can you do this? If you use NCOMM, you have just to click the Transmit-
Window (just as you want to move it). The border of the window will be
inverted. Hold this position until the disco is over. Repeat this if
the disco starts again.

I know this is a very ify-english:-)

PS: If you use another Term and you cant find a way to stop the computer
    from sending, leave me a msg (or an OLM:-) and I will code a short tool.
