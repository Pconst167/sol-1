  TITLE:
      DOS "Cannot find command interpreter" and a message
      incorrect DOS version
      Bad or missing COMMAND.COM

  OVERVIEW:
      The command interpreter (usually COMMAND.COM) can be specified in
      CONFIG.SYS (SHELL=...) or in AUTOEXEC.BAT (SET COMSPEC=...).  It may be
      invoked in both.  If not specifically invoked, the default is
      COMMAND.COM.

  ISSUES/COMMENTS:
      1) When DOS is unable to locate the specified command interpreter on
      disk, it issues the message "Bad or missing command interpreter", and the
      system halts.

      2) STACKER's incremental installation copies COMMAND.COM (and/or whatever
      interpreter is specified by SHELL=...)into the newly created volume, so
      that it can be located even when drives are swapped.  Free space
      installation does not provide for this.

      3) On systems where the DOS version has been changed or where a boot
      diskette has been used, the "Incorrect DOS version" message may result
      from a discrepancy between the COMMAND.COM files on the boot drive and on
      the STACKER volume.

  RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
      1) Ensure there is agreement between the SHELL= and SET COMSPEC=
      statements in CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, respectively.

      2) Ensure there is a copy of the command interpreter in the drive and
      directory indicated.  For example, if SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM, verify
      that:
          a) the \DOS directory is present on the boot drive (and swapped
          STACKER volume, if applicable);
          b) COMMAND.COM (or the command interpreter) is located in the
          directory/ies.

      3) Compare the file sizes, dates and times of COMMAND.COM wherever
      present (root and \DOS directories).
