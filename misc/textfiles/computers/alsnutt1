NU 5.0 FILEFIND TIP

Are you tired of FILEFIND searching each matching file on your
disk for a text string when all you really wanted was to limit
the seach to the matching files in the directory you were in at
the moment?  If you can't always remember the command line switches
here's a simple little batch file called LF.BAT (for 'local find'):
 
FF .\%1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9     ;For example: LF yourtext
 
Place it in your path.  Simple and more intuitive than remembering
to type ".\*.*" or "/C".


SYSTEM SHUT-DOWN TIP

Here's another slick little batch file that will give your hard disk
a quick once over and defrag it before you shut-down for the day.
As an option you could add a disk park program of your choice.

QUIT.BAT

NDD C: /QUICK      ;Norton Disk Doctor /QUICK=just test system area
SD C: /U /A /V     ;Speed Disk /U=update /A=all /V=volume
PARK               ;Use any 'park' utility on hard disk
                   ;shut power off
 
If you have multiple partitions on your hard disk be sure to add the
same commands for each drive.


NORTON COMMANDER 3.0 ZIP VIEWER

Norton Commander 3.0 has the capabilty to view many major file formats
except .ZIP files.  Future versions are rumoured to have this capability.
For now you could try the following:

1. Edit (or create) your NC.EXT file to include:
         ZIP: PKUNZIP -V !.!     ;allows you to 'view' the contents
2. Park your cursor on the zip file and press Enter
3. Use the NC command CTRL-E to actually unzip the file after 'viewing'
         edit out the '-V' option and press Enter again to unzip
