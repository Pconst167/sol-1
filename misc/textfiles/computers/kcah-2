:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: CARRIER ACCESS CODES ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::: By The Rebel <TTL> / Editor ::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


A carrier access code is used to use a long distance carrier such as US Sprint
or MCI on a line that does not carry it(such as a pay phone or a home phone
using a different long distance company). They can also be used to delay phone
bills. To use a carrier access code you just dial the carrier access code(10 +
that long distance company's 3 digit access code) and then act as if you were
just dialing the number. US Sprint's delay can be up to 8 months or as little
as 3. You never know EXACTLY the amount of time the delay will be but you can
be sure that there will be one. You can also use a carrier access code to do a
ringback, the problem with this particular ringback technique is that it'll
only ring once. What you have to do to produce the ringback is just dial 10 +
LD 3 Digit Code + Ringback Number, just wait for the click and hang up. Most
of the time it'll be a full ring but sometimes it'll be cut off,it's useful in
some instances. Here is a list of some particular carrier access codes that
work in my area:

                               10333 - US Sprint
                               10288 - AT&T
                               10222 - MCI
                               10444 - ?
                               10888 - Gives Fast-Busy Tone
                               10999 - ?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: NIGHTMARE BBS BUST :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::: By The Rebel <Former Co-SysOp;Nightmare BBS> ::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

TTL Associate BBS,Nightmare, was confiscated from the home of White Phantom on
February 26th. Needless to say, he was not placed under arrest. The computer
was confiscated,not for hack/phreak or piracy,but for pornography. Yes, the
Department of Exploited Children. Not child pornography, but the underaged
accessing it. No charges have been posed upon White Phantom(s) and,though
there was a scare about hack/phreak and piracy charges,no hack/phreak material
was on the premises and there has been no official talk of copyright
infringement.  The stupid thing about this bust is that they got busted for
stuff on their front.  The cops didn't even know about the back board! Since
this was a pornography case there has been no federal agents on this
investigation as of 3/3/90.

::::::::::::::::::::: POLICE/FIRE RADIOS GOING HIGH-TECH :::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::: by The Rebel <TTL / Editor> ::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


    A new police/fire radio system will be put into effect by July 1991, in
Columbus,Ohio. It is a $12 million dollar system that's communications center
will be based in the basement of a former Xerox complex on Fairwood Avenue.
    This system will include 2,500 "high-tech" handle-held radios and
approximately 800 radios for police cars and fire trucks.  5 150-foot
communication towers will be constructed in May, according to assistant public
safety director, Wendell V. Metz.
    Metz said that "the reason for the new system is that the old one is
falling apart around our ears."
    Other reasons for the new system include:

          o Combination of police and fire communications.
          o 20 channel at 800 megahertz rather than the old 4 channel at 450
            megahertz.
          o Push-button responses from police cars and fire trucks.
          o Conversations on most channels will be difficult to pick up on
            scanners, and impossible on certain channels that will transmit in
            code.

   Coded channels will be used for sensitive undercover narcotics and SWAT
operations said Metz, excitedly,and not to accurately, exclaiming "there's one
chance in a billion that someone can unscramble it!"
   Metz also released dispatcher color-code information to me.  Green, he
says, will mean that the officer has received the message. Yellow will mean en
route. Red might mean that the officer is on the scene and blue will mean that
the officer is on the scene and standing by.
    "It will keep track of every vehicle under a particular dispatcher's
control," he said. It also means there will be a lot less chatter on the
radio.
    "We need to be sure that the Red Cross, Civil Defense, the Emergency
Management Agency and other area police and fire departments are able to
communicate with us and us with them," Metz said.
    Once old police and fire radios are removed from service, they will be
used by other city departments or sold, Metz said.
    "They'll be put to good use," he said.
    I am sure that this will just help bring about a new techniques of
hacking. Though the system will be much more high-tech it will not be as good
as Metz believes, security-wise.

As you see.. The formats changed but I'm still the one writing the
articles.... I probably will be the one writing the articles from here on
out... All information given will be fully accredited as well as articles
submitted. All articles and information can be submitted on The Switchroom,The
Billionare Boyz Club, UNCENSORED!, or any other board which I call.  The PO
Box will be gone by April, not enough usage to warrant the cost.
