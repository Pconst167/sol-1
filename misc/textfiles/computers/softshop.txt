                    STRAPPING ON THE UTILITY BELT

   If it seems like we went a little overboard with Windows utilities 
this month, well, we did. So if your digital tool belt feels a little 
light, stock up on tools here. Check out the New Releases and New 
Versions sections for the latest, best Windows performance gadgets.

   This month we covered everything from Program Manager replacements to 
a cool .SCR Windows screen blanker. What else can I say about utilities? 
Not much. Thinking about utilities makes me want to shut up and go 
optimize my hard disk. So, I think I will.

   Don't forget to wear safety goggles, always keep the blade guard 
engaged, and enjoy this month's selection.

   Psst! If anyone feels the urge to giggle at my Near StartUp tip in 
the SOLUTIONS section, I challenge you to put all these utilities in 
YOUR Windows StartUp group and keep all individual bells and whistles 
straight!

                          <>  FONTER v6.2  <>
                Look at Fonts Before They're Installed!

   Less than a decade ago fonts were high-ticket items: you could easily 
spend $50 or more for a good set of Times Roman and Helvetica clones. 
Today you can buy a CD-ROM disc of 2000 fonts for under $10. Bargain 
font collections abound. So many fonts, so little hard-disk space! The 
question everybody's asking now is, "How can I tell whether I like any 
of these fonts without having to go through the rigmarole of installing 
ALL of them?" If you're using Fonter v6.2, a welcome update to a 
versatile Windows 3.1 font utility, the answer is simple: "Just preview 
them!"

   Yes, in Version 6.2, Fonter adds the ability to preview -- and even 
print specimen sheets -- of fonts that aren't installed yet on your 
system. Just click on the Preview button and double-click to choose a 
bare .TTF file, and you can see how it'll look before it's installed and 
eating system resources. Fonter even gives you the option of temporarily 
installing a font, so it'll be good for just your current Windows 
session, and then remove itself.

   Fonter remains one of the best utilities for viewing and printing 
samples of installed fonts, too. You can print a sample sheet of a 
single font, which shows sample text formatted in various point sizes, 
along with extended characters -- or you can click on File/Print Book 
[All Fonts], go to bed, and wake up in the morning to a ream of font 
samples.

   One of my favorite Fonter features is the ability to type my own 
sample text for onscreen viewing at various point sizes. That makes it a 
piece of cake to audition fonts for titles on crucial page layouts. I 
also like it that Fonter can map characters onto a graphic of a 
keyboard, and then let you print it. This helps if you're trying to type 
in foreign language characters, like Cyrillic or Hebrew -- you'll never 
let that printed keyboard reference out of your sight!

                   <>  HERETIC: CITY OF THE DAMNED  <>
         If DOOM Were Reincarnated as a Fantasy Adventure Game . . .

   Let's see. If DOOM were a fantasy adventure game, I bet that instead 
of shooting aliens with shotguns, our hero would blast demon creatures 
with a magic wand. And I bet that instead of searching for ammo packs, 
he would seek out magic talismans and charms.

   What do you know?! That's exactly what happens in Heretic, a 3-D 
virtual-reality, combat-type game (in the vein of Wolfenstein 3-D and 
DOOM). Heretic is in fact from id Software, creator of DOOM, and Raven 
Software. If you've played DOOM, then you know all you need to know to 
play Heretic: blast the creatures, test the walls for hidden doors, grab 
all the loot you can find, look for more powerful weapons (like the 
ethereal crossbow -- much more lethal than the wand), and restock your 
weapon supply (you never have all the ethereal arrows you'd like!).

   The setting is pure gothic with its dark, dank dungeons, monolithic 
rock formations and pools of dark liquid. The cast of enemies fits right 
in. There are red "bat demons," mummy creatures and other evil things. 
The bat demons have a neat trick. They can hover near the ceiling and 
pound you good. If they're hovering directly overhead, you can't see 
them, but you can usually run away a bit, turn around, and shoot them 
down. They explode very satisfyingly. Like DOOM, Heretic offers 
interesting architectural touches, such as angled passageways, narrow 
stairways and ramps.

   I found some aspects of game play more difficult in Heretic than in 
DOOM. In certain rooms there appear to be hair triggers that raise the 
walls to reveal a horde of enemies -- who quickly overpower you. You 
think you're alone, and then pow! This happens a lot.

   Heretic is even bigger than DOOM, taking up about 2.88MB of disk 
space -- compressed. We at Software Shopper have not figured out how to 
split up the files yet (I don't think we'd want to try). But if you're 
on a BBS -- and you have to be to read this! -- then finding Heretic 
will be a piece of cake. Just look for the DOS game with the highest 
recent download count.

   A number of auxiliary programs come with Heretic. DM.EXE, the 
DeathManager, is used as a front end for network and modem play with 
Heretic and DOOM. DWANGO.EXE is client software for a multiplayer online 
service (call up any time to play DeathMatches in DOOM or Heretic 
against people from around the world) -- you'll need a credit card for 
billing if you try DWANGO. IPXSETUP.EXE lets you play Heretic and DOOM 
over an IPX network. And SERSETUP.EXE lets you play over a modem or 
serial cable.

   The system requirements have gotten stiffer. Heretic calls for a 
33MHz 486 or better CPU, 4MB of RAM, and about 10MB of hard-disk space. 
It costs $40 to register and receive new levels.

   Heretic is a blast from the past in more ways than one, but I can't 
help but love it. I love all violent 3-D, VR, combat-style games equally 
(though the bloodier, the better). It's something my therapist and I are 
working on. I WISH he would stop trouncing me in DeathMatches, though.

               <>  MUSIC SCULPTOR FOR WINDOWS V1.4  <>
                       Point-and-Click Composer

   Music Sculptor is the most fun I've had with my sound card in a long 
time. Have you ever had a little ditty running around in your head that 
you think would make a great song, and you want to record it? But you 
can't figure out those complicated MIDI sequencers? And you'd feel silly 
humming into a tape recorder? Music Sculptor, from Alpha Omega Software, 
is a MIDI sequencer you can live with.

   Music Sculptor draws a portion of the piano keyboard onscreen and 
invites you to click out some notes with your mouse. Once you've got 
your ditty down, you can click on the Record button to save it for 
posterity as a .MID file. Or, if you're like me and you can't resist, 
you can play with the music and add extra layers of sound (tracks, that 
is, to us sonically savvy folk), trying to insert a little harmony.

   Besides the piano view, there's a track view, and you can have both 
views onscreen at the same time. For each track you can select which 
instrument you'd like to play the notes. (This is where I had most of my 
fun! It's neat to have your melody and bass lines swap instrument 
assignments, just to hear what happens.) Here you can also instruct 
certain tracks to play or be silent while you're recording new tracks. 
Before you know it, you'll have clicked yourself into a symphony (or, 
perhaps, a cacophony <G>).

   Sample MIDI files are included, and they're modifiable, of course -- 
which means you'll get your chance to try and improve upon them. I wish 
the program had included the ability to print scores of the music in 
musical notation, but I probably wish for too much. Music Sculptor makes 
a great first program for the budding composer. It requires a Windows 
3.1-supported sound card.

                        <>  SMILERSHELL V2.0  <>
                    A Handy Command Line for Windows

   You can take the girl out of DOS, but you can't take the DOS out of 
the girl.

   Sometimes Windows is too much. Sometimes you just plain miss the old 
DOS prompt! Say you want to check the time/date stamp of a file over in 
some subdirectory. Do you really want to wait on File Manager to load 
and then do all the clicking required to get to see the file 
particulars? No! Who would? Shelling out to DOS and typing a simple DIR 
command is much faster. But SmilerShell from Bardon Data Systems has an 
even faster solution for situations like these: it brings the command 
line to Windows!

   If you add SmilerShell's icon to Windows' StartUp group, it'll be 
ready and waiting to carry out your typed commands. The small, three-
line window can be set to stay on top, or act like any other window (and 
be fetched by the Task Manager or a quick ALT-TAB). The top "line" 
consists of the title bar, as you'd expect of any Windows application. 
But SmilerShell adds a neat touch by giving you the option of displaying 
the time there. The bottom line is the prompt line, and the middle line 
is for the menu options.

   If you're thinking menu options would be out of place in a program 
whose job is to replace the DOS prompt, think again! We found a terrific 
use for SmilerShell's Edit/Paste command. When we write about DOS tips 
and tricks for PCM Online, this is how we go about it: we type the 
command in a Word for Windows file as we're writing the article, then we 
shell out to DOS (to test), type the command, jump back into Word to 
verify we typed it exactly as it appears, jump back to DOS and execute 
the command. That's a lot of wasted time when you consider SmilerShell 
lets you do this: select and copy the command from Word, jump over to 
SmilerShell and do an Edit/Paste, then press ENTER to execute the 
command.

   SmilerShell offers many other ways to speed up keyboard operations. 
It keeps a command history of all your typed commands, so you can re-
execute them without retyping them. It also supports aliases, which 
means you can just type "d" and have SmilerShell know you mean "dir." 
(You can also configure the F2 through F12 keys as aliases.) SmilerShell 
includes a fast directory change command, which works over multiple 
drives, and can take you instantly to a subdirectory many levels deep. 
And SmilerShell lets you launch both DOS and Windows programs just by 
typing their filenames at the prompt! So now DOS touch-typist junkies 
can merely type SOL instead of CLICK on an ICON (yecch! <G>) to play 
their favorite Windows game.

                       <>  SUPERBAR v2.0B  <>
              Add Custom Toolbars to Windows Applications

   You know what the problem with Windows Write is -- besides the lack 
of a spelling checker? It's square, man. There are no jazzy icons to 
click. Bor-ing. Ever wish there were a way to add toolbars to Windows 
programs that lack them (or even add new special-purpose toolbars above 
and beyond existing toolbars)? Your wish is granted in SuperBar, a 
shareware utility you can use to create custom, configurable toolbars.

   The buttons on a SuperBar toolbar can be assigned to an application 
menu command -- or to a recorded macro. SuperBar has its own macro 
definition feature, which is great for automating tasks in programs that 
lack macro capability.

   I used SuperBar to jazz up Windows Write with the expected File New, 
File Open and Print buttons, but I also created buttons to bring up the 
Fonts dialog box and to set justification. The toolbar appeared between 
the title bar and the menu bar, pushing the menu bar down a line. (The 
default toolbar position is at the top, below the title bar, though you 
can assign it to the left, right or bottom of the application's window.) 
The toolbars remain in effect as long as SuperBar is running. So you can 
load and exit Windows Write all day, and that toolbar will stick tight 
(as long is SuperBar is running too). If you want to ensure your 
toolbars are always available, consider plopping SuperBar's icon in 
Windows' StartUp group.

   Toolbar button setup is taken care of inside SuperBar. To create a 
toolbar for an application, select that application from SuperBar's task 
list (the application must currently be open). SuperBar displays all the 
application's available menu options, and you choose which ones you 
would like to turn into buttons. Then you assign an icon to each button. 
If you can't find a suitable icon from the 80+ icon samples, you can use 
the provided icon manager program to create and paint your own.

   Custom toolbars not only increase efficiency by placing common 
commands on a toolbar for point-and-click ease -- they also speed 
learning. It's much easier to train new users to click on graphical 
toolbar buttons than to dig through menus. Say the new worker at the 
office can't seem to remember the name of File X, and then forgets how 
to prep it -- just create a toolbar button that runs a macro to call up 
File X, do the formatting, and print the prized report, all in one step!

   SuperBar is one program I'm glad to have in my utility belt.

Fonter v6.2
Preview your fonts, print samples!
     Fonter lets you view samples of your Adobe PostScript and
     TrueType fonts in whatever size you like. You can also
     "zoom" characters for close-up views, see ANSI charts and
     even a keyboard layout showing which keyboard keys to type

     dingbat and foreign-language fonts. You can also print
     samples of single fonts, or print a "book" of all your
     fonts. New features in v6.2 include the ability to preview
     TrueType fonts (before installing!); print specimen sheets
     of previewed fonts; install TrueType Fonts for a single
     session in Windows, or install them permanently. Neat
     program!

Music Sculptor for Windows v1.4
A cool MIDI sequencer
     Would you like to be a composer? Do you have a
     Windows-supported sound card (like the Sound Blaster) or a
     MIDI interface? Then try Music Sculptor. It's an
     easy-to-use MIDI sequencer with a graphical representation
     of a piano keyboard. You can enter music on this keyboard
     with your mouse, or enter it from an external MIDI keyboard
     if you have one. It's a lot of fun to record a main melody
     line on the first track, then try to "click out" some
     harmony on other tracks while the melody is playing. (It's
     also fun to change instrument assignments.) There is no
     score, or sheet-music view. Sample MIDI files are included.
Requires: Windows 3.1, sound card

     Windows still does so poorly? Try SmilerShell: it's like a
     DOS command line in Windows, but even more powerful! It
     lets you run Windows programs, DOS programs and even DOS
     internal commands. It gives you a fast directory change
     command (over multiple drives). Plus, it gives you aliases;
     does pipes and redirection; and offers a built-in

     intuitive way to organize applications for both beginners
     and pros, and it's neater. Other handy things Plug-In
     Manager does is let you decorate Windows' title bars with
     the time, date, a stopwatch and a resource watchdog (to
     keep an eye on your free drive space, for example). You can
     also set alarms and change the look of your mouse cursor.
     Another important feature is the "Power Button": a
     Task-Manager-like tool that helps you quickly get where you
     want to go (the button is located conveniently at the left

FormGen's Top 10
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                              March 1995
                 These figures are from February 1995.

               The lists are compiled from unit sales of 
             evaluation disks by leading shareware vendors
            around the world. The lists are produced monthly
           by Dorinda MacLean and distributed by FormGen Corp.

                 The symbols next to "Rank" indicate whether
                 the title is growing more popular or losing 
                 ground:

                        ^  =  up from last month
                        v  =  down from last month
                        -  =  no change

What Is Shareware?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                          WHAT IS SHAREWARE?
                           HOW DOES IT WORK?

   Shareware operates on the "try before you buy" system. Authors allow 
their programs to be copied and passed around, among friends, over BBS 
systems or through services such as Software Shopper.

   If you find a shareware program is of value to you and you intend to 
keep and use it, then you must register the program with the author (pay 
a fee -- the amount varies). Registration gives you various benefits, 
depending on the author. (Common benefits include printed manuals, newer 
versions and support if you happen to run into problems.) The fee also 
helps motivate authors to improve their programs and develop new ones.

   No part of the money collected by Software Shopper, or any other 
service, goes to the program authors. Those charges are strictly 
copying, handling and shipping fees, and they are non-refundable. The 
author gets paid only when you send in your registration fee. We supply 
all copies of shareware programs on both 5-1/4- and 3-1/2- inch disks, 
although there is an extra charge of 75 cents per disk for 3-1/2-inch 
(720K) format. There is no extra charge for 3-1/2-inch 1.44MB (high-
density disks).

   Programs are separated into subdirectories on a disk when we make up 
special orders for you (most of our orders are special orders). A short 
instruction sheet is packaged with the disk, but your disk label tells 
you the name of the subdirectories.

   Generally, our orders are processed within 24 business hours of 
receipt. Due to volume, we may run a day or so behind from time to time. 
Our business hours are generally 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through 
Friday.

   We disclaim any damage that any of the software in Software Shopper 
may cause and cannot guarantee that any particular system follows sound 
business practices. Our sole liability, in any event, consists of a 
refund of the copying and distribution charge we make for providing 
software to you.

   We invite and solicit your comments and suggestions about Software 
Shopper and the shareware which we make available through it. Our 
shareware library contains many more programs than appears in this issue 
of Software Shopper. If you have a specific need, please contact us on 
our Customer Assistance line, (502) 228-4492. We will do everything we 
can to try to help.


   Falsoft, Inc. is an approved vendor and associate member of the 
Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP). ASP wants to make sure 
that the shareware principle works for you. If you are unable to resolve 
a shareware-related problem with an ASP member by contacting the member 
directly, ASP may be able to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you 
resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide 
technical support for members' products. Please write to the ASP 
Ombudsman at 545 Graver Road, Muskeg, MI 49442, or send a CompuServe 
message via CompuServe Mail to ASP Ombudsman 70007, 3536.

About the Catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The rest of Software Shopper Online is our database or "catalog" -- 
the majority of the shareware programs in our archives, which are 
neither new nor updated this month. While you'll see more than a 
thousand programs listed in the database, please keep in mind that more 
is coming! We're still in the process of converting records, so future 
issues will be more complete. If your favorite shareware title is 
missing from the database now, it will probably soon be added.

   Also, a note about how the database is structured. There really is a 
method to the madness! We divided the database into 32 sections (usually 
32): 16 broad categories for DOS and the same 16 broad categories for 
Windows. (Categories include Business, Education, Games, Utilities, 
etc.) Each rather generic category is in turn broken down into smaller 
subcategories -- for example, "Business" is broken down into Accounting, 
Contact Management, Personal Finance and others.

   When you read the database, it will look like each category starts 
out nicely in alphabetical order -- but then does several A-Z cycles! 
The reason for this is that the subcategories are also in alphabetical 
order. Yes, we COULD have separated the database into distinct 
subcategory files, but your SysOps would have wanted to murder us for 
making them deal with hundreds of files instead of the slightly unwieldy 
32! As long as you know the subcategory structure is there, you should 
have no trouble finding the kinds of programs you're interested in.

   We do not have registration fee information available for all titles, 
so for those "Author's fee" fields that show a fee of "0.00," please do 
not assume that registration is free!


>>[ An Invitation to Shareware Authors ]<<

   Shareware authors: we invite you to monitor our catalog to help keep 
us up-to-date with your titles. Although we receive the ASP Advantage 
CD-ROM and get disks sent to us by shareware authors, we don't get 
everything we'd like -- so we turn to BBSs and online services for files 
we're missing (and of course read the vendor info to make sure we're 
allowed to distribute the programs we download). We'd rather that the 
programs came directly from you -- and we're sure you'd prefer that too. 
Feel free to send us your updates and new titles. Our mailing address 
is: Software Shopper, P.O. Box 385, Prospect, KY 40059. Our shipping 
address is: Software Shopper, The Falsoft Building, 9509 U.S. Highway 
42, Prospect, KY 40059.

   We've got to tell you about our new high-density line. Many shareware 
vendors are still putting out titles on low-density floppy disks only, 
but we're proud to have launched our "HD" line: which means we can 
competitively distribute titles like DOOM, Raptor, GeoPublish and 
NeoBook Pro on high-density disks (complete with nifty, laser-printed 
labels). So, large programs don't upset us! We do request that, when you 
send us large programs, you break them into chunks that would also fit 
on 1.2MB floppy disks. But if you can't, that's OK -- we'll just insert 
a note asking readers to order the program on 1.44MB disks only.
