          A modem is a device that allows a computer to communicate
          and transfer files with other computers over a telephone
          line. The word modem is an acronym. Modem stands for
          modulator-demodulator.  
          
          When a modem sends data, it is acting as a digital to
          analog converter. That is, it takes data in digital form
          and converts it to sound (analog) to go over a telephone
          line. The modem on the receiving end acts as an analog to
          digital converter. It takes the sound (analog) it
          receives and translates it into data. 
          
          If you want to have some fun, go to the largest super
          computer store that you can find. One with plenty of
          salespeople. Find a salesperson who looks eager. Tell him
          you are new to computers; however, a friend told you to
          get a modulator-demodulator for your computer. One
          salesperson will ask another and so on up the chain. If
          it gets to the top, you might be nice and give them a
          hint: "I believe he said it was also called a modem." 
          
          
          WHY MODEM?
          
          The question is not, "Why modem?" but, "Why not Modem?"
          People are buying modems and learning how to use them for
          all kinds of reasons. Below are fifteen popular reasons

              13. Use your modem to connect to your county
                  records.

                  "dial-up" service to search for books from
                  the comfort of your own home. You can find
                  out if the book you want is available or if
                  it has been checked out. Many local libraries
