     A Shareware File by Barry Orlando     Dated: Dec. 28, 1988 
      
       
      
     Introduction 
      
      
      
     This shareware text file provides a procedure which details a 2.5
     megabyte on board RAM upgrade project. The method described replaces 16
     256K dynamic RAM chips with 16 one megabit dynamic RAM chips installed
     in chip sockets. Reinstallation of the ST's metal shield cover is also
     not impaired.  

     The beauty of this modification is that pin compatibility is simplified
     by the use of sockets instead of directly soldering the 1 meg RAM chips
     (DRAMs) to the motherboard and by the fact that the removed bank of
     sixteen perfectly reusable 256K DRAMs can be resold by you to persons
     upgrading 520STfm computers to 1 megabyte. 
      
     If you use this upgrade method, I recommend that you also use the same
     high quality low contact resistance sockets that I used and have listed
     below, than to use any other standard sockets. These are the type and
     quality which are used on expansion boards made for the IBM clones.

     I originally wrote this procedure to aid me in upgrading my own
     1040ST's memory to 2.5 megabytes because I didn't trust myself not
     making mistakes and possibly damaging any of the electronic components,
     especially the new DRAMs which I didn't consider cheap. I might note
     that my 1040ST's pc-board was marked Rev 4, but I don't believe that
     any other recent board revisions (if they exist) for boards with 32
     256K DRAMs installed should affect this procedure.  

      
     Disclaimer of Liability 
      
      
     I make no claim that this modification will work for you. I can 
     only say that it worked for me. This modification should not be 
     attempted by anyone except by someone with experience repairing or
     building digital electronic circuits. Performing this modification will
     be done at your own risk and may void the warranty on your computer.

     Background 
      
      
     The 256K dynamic ram chip differs from the 1 meg dynamic ram chip by
     having one additional connection, namely the address input A9. The
     following chip diagram illustrates this and shows pin layouts:

                   **       pc-board pin compatible on most chips 
      
      
     The 2.5 megabyte modification essentially reconnects all pins as 
     previously connected on the lower of two banks of RAM chips plus adds a
     new line from the previously unused A9 pin on the ST's MMU (pin 64 of
     U15) to all new 1 meg chip pins A9 via a new 33 ohm resistor. Some of
     the Address leads are interchanged, but this has no effect on the
     operation of the computer.

     Work Area 
      
      
     Prepare your work area by placing a towel on your flat working 
     surface and cover it with a layer of aluminum wrapping foil. This
     provides padding for the components and a conductor for static 
     electricity. 
      
      
     Precautions 
      
      
     Since the slightest static discharge could easily damage 
     components on your computers pc-board, always keep one hand on the
     metal foil bonded along the outer rim of the pc-board before and during
     touching any part of the pc-board or its components. Avoid working on
     this project when the humidity is low.

     Procedure 
      
       
     1. After removing the pc-board from the insides of your computer,
     desolder and remove the front 16 256K chips (U33 through U45 and U16
     through U30). 
      
     2. Using the Exacto knife, cut the following traces on the top side of
     the pc-board: 
      
          a. Between U30's pin 1 and U61's pin 1. 
          b. Between pin 14's of U33 through U45 and U16 through U30 and
          other pin 14's of U46 through U61.
          c. Between the thru-hole (nearest to pin 1 in center of U32) of
          U32 and U46's pin 1. (Note: This thru-hole traces to U32's pin 1
          on the underside of the board.) 
      
     3. Using the Exacto knife, cut the following traces on the bottom side
     of the pc-board: 
      
          a. Between U30's pin 1 and the 32 ohm resistor R76. 
          b. Between U32's pins 2 and 14. Do the same for U33 through U45
          and U16 through U30.
          c. Between U30's pin 4 and U15's pin 8. (Note: Cut the trace after
          it goes through the board to the bottom side near resistor R91,
          but before it reappears on the top of the board via another
          thru-hole. 
          d. Between U32's pin 14 and the thru-hole located between U32 and
          U33. 
      
     4. Preparing New Sockets and Soldering Them Inplace 
      
          a. On all 16 new sockets, remove the internals of pin 4. 
          b. On all 16 new sockets, bend all pins 1 and 17 flat against
          their bottom then up against their outer side. 
          c. On 14 of the new sockets, bend pin 18's flat against their
          bottom and pointing straight out to the side. 
          d. On the remaining two, bend both pin 18's flat against their
          bottom but back and down so it will just reach and fit into the
          pc-board hole of it's adjacent pin (pin 17). These two sockets
          will be installed and soldered with the socket's pin 18 going into
          the old 256K chip's pin 16 hole below the new socket's pin 17.
          Trial fit these two sockets at this time.
          e. Using a pair of scissors, cut pieces of "Socket Wrap-ID"
          plastic markers for sandwiching them between the new sockets and
          the pc-board during installation. These little plastic markers
          should be cut so as to electrically isolate the socket's pins 1
          and 17 from leads and traces on the pc-board, and from pin 18 of
          the socket for the two separately prepared sockets above, but also
          so as not to interfere with seating the socket's four pads flush
          with the top of the pc-board upon installation. 
          f. Solder the two sockets with the bent back pin 18 and markers

                                                  4


          into U30 and U33. 
          g. Solder the remaining sockets with markers into U34 through U45
          and U16 through U29. Pin 18 of these socket's must be soldered to
          the top of the board at the nearest thru-hole that the pin 18 just
          barely reaches. Use plenty of heat as these thru-holes are big
          heat sinks. 
      
     5. Mounting The New 33 Ohm Resistor 
      
          a. Install a new 33 ohm resistor on the pc-board by drilling two
          small holes from the top at points near capacitor C55 and resistor
          R70. Make sure you don't drill through a trace on the other side
          by holding the pc-board up to a bright light and marking the spots
          with a pencil. 
      
     6. Wiring 
      
          Wire the following connections on the top side of the board: 
      
          a. Between U32's new socket's pins 1 and 17 and a thru-hole on the
          pc-board between U32 and U33. This thru hole is the only one that
          has a trace that run to another thru-hole between U46 and U47 on
          the top side of the board. 
          b. Between U16's new socket's pins 1 and 17, and pin 2 of U54.
          Solder the wire directly to the side of the chips pin 2. 
          c. Between each of the remaining new socket's pin 1 and 17 and a
          thru-hole in back of each 256K RAM chip (i.e., U47 through U53 and
          U55 through U61). These thru-holes are the ones that you will find
          traces back to either pin 2 or pin 14 of U47 through U61 and then
          trace over toward U22, U23, U26, and U27. Actually, pins 2 and 14
          are tied together on the bottom of the board for every 256K RAM
          chip still installed. So that's 14 more wires altogether (i.e.,
          each new RAM chip's pins 1 and 17 will be connected to the pins 2
          and 14 of the 256K chip directly in back of it.  
      
          Wire the following connections on the bottom side of the board
          (Note: all pin numbers here refer to the pin numbers on the
          pc-board, not the pin numbers of the new sockets or new ram
          chips): 
      
          d. Between U15's pin 64 and one side of the new 33 ohm resistor. 
          e. Between all pin 14's of U32 through U45 and U16 through U30,
          and the other side of the new 33 ohm resistor. 
          f. Between all pin 2's of U32 through U45 and U16 through U30, and
          the thru-hole near R91 which had its trace cut to U30's pin 4.
          This thru-hole traces back on top of the pc-board under the bank
          of resistors and over to U15.  
          g. Between U61's pin 1, U30's pin 4, and the cut trace side of
          resistor R76. 
          h. Between U30's pin 1 and U61's pin 3. 
      
     8. Inspect all solder joints with the magnifier for solder shorts and

                                                  5


     faulty connections. Verify that all connections were made correct. 
       
     9. Install the new 1 meg RAM chips into their new sockets. 
      
     10.That's it! Clean isn't it? Now sit back and admire your work. 
      
     12.Reassemble the computer and reconnect the monitor and power cord and
     let it whirl!
