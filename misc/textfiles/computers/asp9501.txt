          ASP strives to produce accurate catalogs BUT this publication may
          contain any number of typographical, graphical, printing, or

               "These programs are produced by members of the Associa-
               tion of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to
               make sure that the shareware principle works for you.
               If you are unable to resolve a shareware-related problem
               with an ASP member by contacting the member directly,
               ASP may be able to help.  The ASP Ombudsman can help you
               resolve a dispute or problem with an ASP member, but

                                      Chapter 1                            
                              How to read this catalog

          ASP members have supplied product descriptions for each shareware
          application they offer.  The catalog groups them by subject
          matter and lists them alphabetically.  If you want to know the
          name/address/phone for the author of a particular program, turn
          to the index and look for the program by name.  You'll usually
          see two page references: one describes the page where you read
          about the program, the other mentions the page where you can find
          information about the author (in Appendix A).  Just turn to the
          appropriate page and scan for the name of the program.

          The Association of Shareware Professionals does NOT rate members'
          software for functionality or usefulness, nor can it attest to
          the validity of any product description in this catalog.  That is
          for you - the user - to decide.  Shareware, especially those
          products authorized to carry the ASP logo, can be tested on a
          "try before you buy" basis.  If the software doesn't meet your
          needs, you won't have to worry about getting a refund.  (That's
          the beauty of the shareware marketing concept.)


          1.1  Minimum requirements

          Every program description lists its computer and operating system
          requirements (e.g. "IBM PC, DOS 2.0 or better").  Unless noted
          otherwise, each program assumes you have a standard keyboard,
          monitor, printer, and either two floppy drives or a hard disk.
          And unless noted otherwise, programs written for the IBM PC
          assume you have at least 512k of total installed RAM.  Many pro-
          grams may also need specific hardware or software such as:
             CD-ROM drive
                         A device capable of reading CD-ROMs.  A CD-ROM
                         looks just like a regular compact disk with music
                         on it, but it has information on it only a
                         computer's CD-ROM drive can read.
             CGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying CGA
                         graphics.  This includes most "laptop CGA"
                         computers, plus higher resolution monitors such as
                         the EGA or VGA.  Some (but not all) of the
                         described programs may operate correctly with a
                         Hercules monitor if you use a "CGA simulator"
                         program; consult your video monitor manual for
                         details.
             Dual 720k disk drives
                         At least two floppy drives capable of writing at
                         least 720k of data per disk, or, preferably, a
                         hard disk (see below).

             EGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying EGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes VGA and
                         other higher-resolution monitors.  CGA and
                         Hercules monitors won't suffice.
             EMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
                         Expanded Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or XMS
                         memory (see below).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
                         implement EMS memory on computers with enough
                         installed memory.
             Epson printer
                         A printer capable of recognizing the Epson print
                         command set (an industry standard).  Some
                         printers, including some laser printers, have
                         options to behave like an Epson printer.  Some
                         programs may require a specific model such as the
                         Epson MX-80 or FX-100.
             Hard disk   A fixed-, removable-, or network-drive device
                         capable of storing multiple megabytes of data.
                         Some programs also assume you have at least one
                         floppy drive in addition to the hard disk.
             Hercules monitor
                         A video monitor capable of displaying Hercules
                         graphics.  CGA, EGA, VGA, & SVGA monitors won't
                         suffice.
             HP DeskJet  A Hewlett-Packard DeskJet or compatible printer.
                         Some programs may require a DeskJet starting with
                         a specific model such as the DeskJet Plus or
                         having a specific feature like a RAM cartridge.
             HP LaserJet A Hewlett-Packard LaserJet or compatible printer.
                         (HP DeskJet printers recognize most, but not all,
                         of the HP LaserJet command set.)  Some programs
                         may require a specific model such as the LaserJet
                         II or with a specific feature like the LaserJet
                         IIIDSi.
             Math coprocessor
                         An IBM PC or compatible computer with an installed
                         math coprocessor unit.  Commonly referred to as an
                         "80x87 chip," these include the 8087, 80287, and
                         80387 coprocessors.  (80486- and Pentium-based
                         computers have math coprocessors by default.)
                         Most 8086-, 80286-, and 80386-based IBM PCs &
                         compatibles have no installed math coprocessor by
                         default.  (80286- and 80386-based computers can
                         accept a math coprocessor if you purchase one.)
             Modem       A modem.  Almost all programs work with a "Hayes
                         compatible" modem, specifically one able to
                         recognize the Hayes command set (an industry
                         standard).  A few programs claim to work with non-
                         Hayes modems too.  Some programs may require the
                         modem to operate at a specific rate of speed (e.g.
                         "1200 baud").
             Mouse       A Logitec- or Microsoft-compatible mouse.

             Network     A computer hooked up a local area network (LAN).
                         Program descriptions will normally specify the
                         different types of LAN systems under which they
                         can operate.
             Plotter     A plotter output device.  Many of the described
                         programs need a plotter able to recognize the HPGL
                         (Hewlett Packard Graphics Language) command set.
             PostScript printer
                         A printer able to interpret the PostScriptr
                         command set.  Many printers (including the HP
                         LaserJet series) offer PostScript compatibility
                         via plug-in cartridges.  Software also exists to
                         emulate PostScript on hundreds of popular
                         printers.
             SVGA monitor
                         A video monitor capable of displaying SVGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
                         resolution monitors.  CGA, EGA, VGA, and Hercules
                         monitors won't suffice.
             Streaming tape device
                         A device capable of reading streaming tapes.  Also
                         referred to as a "tape backup device."  Streaming
                         tapes look something like a standard music
                         cassette or videocassette, but it holds
                         information only a computer can read.  Common
                         streaming tapes include DC600, DC2000, DC2120;
                         tape storage formats include QIC-40 and QIC-80.
             VGA monitor A video monitor capable of displaying VGA
                         graphics.  This almost always includes higher-
                         resolution monitors.  CGA, EGA, and Hercules
                         monitors won't suffice.
             XMS memory  Memory accessible via the Lotus-Intel-Microsoft
                         eXtended Memory Specification.  Not to be confused
                         with expanded memory, extended memory, or EMS
                         memory (see above).  Windows, OS/2, and newer
                         versions of DOS come with software designed to
                         implement XMS memory on computers with enough
                         installed memory.


          1.2  Registration benefits

          All ASP member shareware products come with certain minimum
          benefits when you register.  The author must acknowledge your
          registration (you don't just get a canceled check) and must
          provide a minimum amount of technical support for at least three
          months.

          Many authors provide other registration benefits such as a
          printed manual, a master disk, a year of unlimited phone support,
          source code, etc.  The product description will mention them when
          appropriate.

          ASP Catalog for BBS Users (Master Edition)                      5



          In addition, every ASP member can offer the following benefits to
          registered customers:

             CompuServe
             IntroPak    obtain an introductory membership to the Compu-
                         Serve network with a $15 usage credit when you
                         register an ASP member's shareware product.

          Many authors include this information when they acknowledge
          registrations.  Contact the author if you need assistance.

          Some authors add "registration reminder screens" to the shareware
          version of a program as a way to gently remind people to
          register.  (The ASP sets ethical standards regarding it.)  Almost
          all authors will either send a copy of the program without
          reminder screens, or will disclose a method to disable the
          reminders, once you register the product.


          1.3  Sample product description

          This sample description will help you understand what each field
          means:

          Product:  Shareware Program Name                            [***]
            A "[***]" across from the product name indicates a new or
            updated description since the last catalog.
          Author:  name & phone number of the person or company offering
            this product.  See Appendix A for detailed information about
            the person or company.
          Version:  version number  (release date)
          Needs:  computer type [IBM PC, IBM 80386, Macintosh, etc.],
            operating system, and version number.  May also describe other
            needed or recommended hardware & software.  See above for more
            details.
          Registration fee:  The cost of a single user license, expressed
            in U.S. currency unless otherwise noted.  Many authors provide
            "multi-tier" registrations, and you may pay a little more or
            less than the amount stated here depending on your situation.
            (You can often save money by "reading the fine print.")  Some
            authors include shipping & handling fees in the prices while
            others don't.  Most authors offer network, site, and corporate
            licenses for a higher fee; please contact the author in
            question for details and price quotes.
          SWREG#: applies only to CompuServe users.  You can register this
            product on CompuServe and have the cost added to your service
            bill.  This method of payment proves especially useful for (1)
            overseas users who don't have a credit card accepted by the
            author; and (2) business customers who find it easier to
            register shareware by tacking the fee onto a corporate-

            distribution to the United States.  In some cases the author or
            company may have signed a contract forbidding worldwide share-
            ware distribution.  In other cases the product may only appeal
            to an American audience (income tax software for example).  In
            rare cases, U.S. federal laws may actually prohibit the author
            or company from distributing the product in other countries.

            A "kinder, gentler" Windows screen saver that slowly
            manipulates pixels on the screen.  It runs in one of ten
            different modes that either move, recolor, or erase pixels. You
            can pick a mode or allow it to randomly pick one each time it
            starts.  Some modes eventually fade the screen to black while
            the others move or recolor the pixels originally on the screen.

            A very "user friendly" financial loan system designed to be

            together a multi-million dollar deal to a teenager trying to
            swing that first car loan.  It can calculate any of the loan
            variables (principal, interest rate, payment amount, or number
            of payments), immediately show loan totals, and then generate a
            "payback" schedule which you can review on screen or send to
            the printer for a "hardcopy" record of payments.

            the best times to hunt and fish on any given day for any
            location in the continental United States based on the phase
            and position of the moon. The output is a graph plotted on the
            screen showing the probability of success for the 24 hour
            period selected. Prime time lists are also provided.

            published descriptions date at least 100 years earlier.  Most
            likely the game is even older.  This presents variations on the
            classic peg solitaire with multiple starting positions, and
            varying endgames.  One of the pleasures of playing the game on
            your computer is that you can quickly set up the board to try
            different strategies. Ages 8 to 88.

            A two-player strategy game played on a grid with two sets of
            opposing (red vs. blue) neutral and charged pieces. A player
            moves by choosing an initial velocity for one of his pieces,
            which then follows a trajectory influenced (for a charged
            piece) by the distribution of other charges on the board. The
            motion ends following a collision with another piece. The game
            ends when a charged piece captures (collides with) its opposing
            king.

          Description:
            A unique, abstract and kinetic two-player strategy game played
            on a grid of gray and colored terrain squares. On a given turn,
            a player sets a sequence of up to four pieces in motion, which
            interact with existing terrain and modify it by leaving colored
            trails. Collisions between pieces cause opposing pieces to
            freeze and allied pieces to thaw (if frozen) and move. The game
            ends when all of one player's pieces are frozen. Players may
            edit and save any existing board configuration.

            place blocks of varying size.  That's where the similarity ends
            - you need logic and planning, rather than quick reflexes. You
            build one level of the tower at a time, trying to fit the
            blocks in the tightest pattern.  Each level becomes the base
            for the next level.  Uses Cascoly's unique 3-D perspective
            graphics to show fantastic detail.  As you scroll from side to
            side, the perspective changes.

                                      Chapter 18                           
                                   About shareware


          18.1  Assn. Shareware Professionals

            The Association of Shareware Professionals (ASP) formed in 1987
            to strengthen the future of shareware as an alternative to
            traditional (retail) software marketing.  It also serves as an
            information clearing house for its members and the public at
            large.  ASP members subscribe to a code of ethics and are
            committed to the shareware concept.

            The ASP demands professionalism from its members.  Authors must
            acknowledge every registration (you get more than just a
            canceled check) and they must provide at least three months of
            support for their products.  ASP members must also live up to
            any other benefits they offer.

            You can turn to an ombudsman for help if you can't resolve a
            problem with an ASP author or disk vendor.  Members must
            explain this in every shareware program & disk vendor catalog.

            Few people need the ombudsman's help.  ASP members represent
            the cream of the crop in the shareware industry, but it's nice
            to know you can turn to someone if you think you got a raw
            deal.  Unfortunately, it happens - authors have been kicked out
            because of repeated complaints.

            The Association monitors Congress for potentially damaging
            legislation and has sent spokesmen to testify before
            congressional subcommittees.  It has also taken on the respon-
            sibility of safeguarding the term 'shareware' itself.  ASP has
            filed motions in countries as far away as England and South
            Africa to stop people who attempt to claim it as a trademark
            word.

            ASP members 'meet' online in a public forum of the CompuServe
            network (GO SHAREWARE).  Members send & receive messages,
            transmit files, and exchange valuable information.  Old hands
            in the shareware business pass along their insights to new
            members.  The group holds public and private debates and
            members vote on major issues by sending private messages to the
            Association secretary.

            The ASP holds yearly 'face to face' meetings and appears at
            various trade shows around the country (including COMDEX and
            PC-EXPO).  It also provides speakers who lecture on every
            aspect of shareware.  You can learn more by writing to the
            Association of Shareware Professionals, 545 Grover Road,
            Muskegon, MI 49442.  If you have a modem and a CompuServe

                                  Retired shareware

            This appendix lists shareware products now "retired" by the
            author.  Retired products no longer receive the minimum levels
            of support, and the authors have agreed to return any registra-
            tion fees sent in for the software.

            An author may retire a shareware product for any number of
            reasons.  Some applications have outlived their usefulness;
            others may have grown too costly to continue supporting due to
            competition from other authors.

                             Sorted list of all programs

            This appendix notes the author of each program listed in this
            catalog.  It comes in extremely handy when you want to see if a
            given program comes from an ASP member, or when you want to
            know the current version number/release date for a program.
            Hint: look in the index for the program (by name) if you want
            to see a full description for the program or learn the author's
            address & phone number.  You'll find page references for all
            the information you need.
