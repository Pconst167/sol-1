The following HUGE collection is probably shorter than the book, and not
so well edited, but it hasn't been posted in a long time, so here it is.
Let's see if 160Kb makes it around the Net.  Enjoy.

	COMPUTER-RELATED HORROR STORIES, FOLKLORE, AND ANECDOTES

	Excerpts (edited) from net.rumor, March, 1986, with later
	additions, including a huge number from a rec.humor posting.  I
	did some reformatting and a spelling check.  Have at...

	The Tektronix 4051 (one of the first desk-top computers) had a
	microprocessor (6800 I think) deep inside it.  Although the
	machine's native language was Basic, there were (undocumented)
	hooks to download and run machine code.  The machine also had a
	synthesized bell.  The result, of course, was that 4051 was one
	of the favorite musical instruments in some parts of Tek.

	Anybody remember how to walk an IBM 1130's disk drives?  I
	recall stories that the right program would start them marching
	across the room.

	A friend of mine once told me how he used to do just that at U
	of Delaware.  He used to do it from a terminal room where you
	couldn't see the machine itself, but you'd know when it happened
	-- the disk would pull either its power plug or its connection
	to the mainframe off, and the machine would crash.

	The TRS-80 Model 1 used to put out so much RF interference, that
	one way of adding sound to ANY program was to put a small AM
	radio right by the machine, and listening to the electronic
	"music".  Some programs even used this trait of the trash-80,
	instead of connecting up the external speaker.

	In 1978, a company in my area which specialized in fruit orchard
	temperature alarm systems (it being necessary to awaken the
	farmers to start the smudge pots and ventilators (giant fans) in
	order to prevent damage to the fruit) decided they wanted to go
	into the TRS-80 I peripherals business.  They hired me as an
	engineering technician and programmer.

	There I was, working on programs to drive the peripherals, and
	having even the simplest programs crashing and going haywire for
	no apparent reason.  Being brought up to never assume it's the
	machine's fault, I spent several weeks trying to figure out what
	I was doing wrong.

	The one day my boss asked me to go to the company next door and
	assist them with a problem (they built hydraulic lift units,
	like the ones you see being used in construction...turned out we
	built the electronic control boxes for their lifts).  I walk
	into the shop, and am confronted by 12 extra heavy duty
	arcwelding machines (these guys were welding steel up to 2"
	thick!).  After solving their problem, I traced the power mains.
	Sure enough, we were drawing our AC feed from the same source
	they were, no transformers between us.

	A few hours, a couple of isolation transformers and caps later,
	and all of a sudden my code runs perfectly.

	The boss still didn't believe it, when I showed him the finally
	working code...  he had pretty much decided I was a flop as a
	programmer.  They decided two weeks later not to go into
	computers...  too volatile, they said.

	Back when I was an undergrad at Oberlin College, I had the
	pleasure of working as an operator on their Xerox Sigma 9.  The
	best part of the job was bringing down the machine.  The console
	displayed "Thhhhhhats all Folks!!!", while the processor treated
	you to a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner on the CPU alarm.

	Speaking of doing things to power lines...I remember a story I
	heard from my circuits professor in Colorado.  It seems that
	they received a computer from the government (I can't remember
	the make, but it wasn't anything I had heard of before).  This
	computer was a bit of a beast.  It ran off of 3-phase power, and
	had a disk that was between 3 and 4 feet in diameter.  Well,
	several students were involved in setting up the disk drive one
	night, and when the professor left he told them that they could
	connect everything, but not to power it up until he checked it
	over.

	Well, you know students...they wired it up and turned it on.
	For those of you who are not to familiar with 3-phase power, if
	you reverse any 2 out of the 3 wires, the polarity changes.
	Well, they managed to reverse 2 of the wires, causing the disk
	to spin backwards.  Now, since the heads are designed to float
	on a cushion of air above the disk, they went down instead of
	up, and the disk ended up with a nice groove right down the
	middle.  Needless to say, the prof wasn't pleased when he came
	in the next morning and found his nice new disk turned into so
	many magnetic shavings....

	And then there's the old trick of manipulating an IBM 029
	keypunch so that it punches cards which are all holes.  Great
	bookmarks; I still have a few.

	Ideally you want to have a roomful of keypunches on hand,
	because the mean time between jams when punching those things is
	only a few cards.  What would happen if one of them went into a
	high-speed card reader, I don't know.  The mind boggles.

	(For the benefit of the fuzzy-cheeked youngsters in the crowd,
	punchcards need a certain amount of mechanical strength to
	survive machine handling.  All-holes cards are weak and tear
	easily.  Normal punchcards are constrained to have [as I recall]
	at most one punch per column in rows 1-7, so that the central
	region of the card is mostly solid.)

	While working on a project at Litton Systems, I heard of this
	embarrassing moment.

	One project (for the military) required that the military
	supplied technicians be taught how to service the computers they
	had bought.  The lessons were proceeding well with the explicit
	instructions "Don't apply the power until we check it."
	Naturally, somebody jumped the gun.  Immediately, 120V AC was
	applied across the core memory (yes, core, not silicon).  The
	result?  A pile of slag and a whopping replacement bill.


	/ net.rumor / loral!jlh / Mar 5, 1986 /

	I remember 4 or 5 years back when we were running all our
	microcode and state machine development on a PDP 11 under RSX11.
	Seems time for the annual preventitive maintenance came around,
	and one of the tests is to ensure the drive can read and write
	correctly to each and every block of a disk.  The DEC field
	service tech looked at our rack of disks, saw one labeled 'Jay's
	scratch', and decided to use that for a disk.  Well, you know
	engineers.  A disk is a scratch disk until you put something you
	need on it, at which time it is the working disk.  You also know
	engineers never re-name a disk once it has a label on it.  Jay
	comes in the next day, mounts his disk, and reads out a bunch of
	E5's.  Seems he lost about 3 months of work, only some of which
	he had listings of.  I think the field service rep also caught
	hell for doing that to a customer's disk without asking anyone.


	/ net.rumor / ucla-cs!davis / Mar 6, 1986 /

	I was working in a somewhat large data center not to long ago.
	Seems the company thought they could save some money on
	maintenance costs by going self service.  Well it seems that a
	year or two later another great cost savings idea was to hire
	C.E.'s that had only 6 months training in the electronics
	field!!!  Well the time came to install a new super
	minicomputer, tape cabinet, and disk cabinet.  Well they put the
	new C.E.  in charge of the whole project.  He connected the
	cables from the disk cabinet to the CPU, then connected the
	cables from the tape drive to the CPU.  All set!

	He plugged in the tape drive and then the disk cabinet to A.C.
	When he went to plug in the CPU he noticed that the electrical
	outlet was a different kind than that of the computer.  But this
	C.E.  was smart.  He thought of a way that he could remove the
	plug and install a plug that would fit in the outlet.  (Then the
	company would not have to pay for an electrician).  Good Idea
	except that he switched the HOT and the GROUND wires when
	installing the new plug.  As we all know computers are well
	grounded.  Well the grounding also is good in cables that
	connect to peripherals as well as within the peripherals
	themselves.  Of course this bright C.E.  turned on the disk
	cabinet, tape cabinet, and CPU before plugging in the CPU plug.

	You should have seen the smoke and sparks when he plugged in the
	CPU.  The tape drive was shot, the disk cabinet was shot and the
	CPU was shot!!!!!  At least none of the terminals were connected
	at the time.  It took 4 C.E.s 1 week of constant work to repair
	the damage.  Ever see a memory board with the chips blown to
	kingdomcome?

	In 1970 ('71?)  Fresno State's computer room was the target of a
	firebomb thrown by some protesting students.  The fire
	department arrived and hosed everything down.  The fire damage
	was negligible.  But then the FD decided that since it was
	electrical equipment, they should be using CO2 extinguishers
	instead.

	Either water or CO2 would have been okay alone; but when the CO2
	was sprayed on top of the water, it formed carbolic acid [or is
	it carbonic, I don't remember].  Destroyed all of the equipment,
	the disks, and the tapes.  Took about a year and a half to
	recreate their records from hardcopy.

	---

	At that time, our CDC CE told of a student demonstration in
	Canada where a university's CDC 3300 had been wrecked by
	demonstrators and sold as scrap.  A CE reportedly bought the
	machine after observing that almost all of the damage was bent
	sheet metal and unplugged connectors.  He supposedly set up a
	service bureau in his home.  I'm not sure I believe this story.

	When MCIMail first went on the air, they charged for hardcopy
	mail delivery by the character (actually, 5000-character unit).
	You could mail yourself or a friend a few reams of paper for $1
	by sending a file of formfeeds.  They fixed their charging when
	we pointed this out.

	Also, their password-generator occasionally spits out somewhat
	racy words (they have the form consonant-vowel-consonant-...
	-vowel, 8 characters in all).  The generator checks for most of
	the obvious bad ones, but it seems a few must slip by the
	censors.  We suggested that they ought to charge extra for the
	racy ones, on the grounds that they would be so much easier to
	remember.  This idea was rejected, though its originator got
	such a password for the thought.

	Not only is it true, it has also happened a lot more than just
	once.  In fact, this is one of the simplest computer scams
	going.  One of the cleverest ones I ever heard about involved
	someone working for a company (a fruit company, I believe) who
	had the computer change (just slightly) the recorded times (and
	prices) of the company's transactions on the commodities
	exchanges.  His profits came from the slight changes (say,1/16
	of a point) in the contract prices that occur all the time
	during a normal trading day.

	I have seen several books which talk about these and other
	schemes in detail.  Unfortunately, the names and dates are often
	not revealed as most companies are loath to have the general
	public find out the ease with which these types of crimes can be
	carried out, as well as the difficulty of discovering them once
	they have occurred.  One of the most revealing items is the fact
	that computer criminals are almost always caught only because
	discrepancies in their lifestyles are noted (e.g.  buying a
	40-foot yacht on a $20k salary).  In fact, the longest running
	crime I heard about, which involved a programmer (I believe) in
	a prominent New York bank, went on for close to 10 years.  The
	culprit escaped detection so long because he had a $30,000-a-
	month gambling habit and was losing his illegal income as fast
	as he got it.  He was finally caught when his bookie was
	arrested as part of a police 'sting' operation, and his name was
	found on the books as one of the largest customers.

	As for finding more out about such things, all the information I
	have came from browsing through the MIT engineering library for
	a few afternoons, so I imagine that any good college library
	should have at least some material on this.  Good luck in
	finding out some actual names and dates, however!

	My mom (a CPA) was on an audit of a large S & L several years
	ago where they caught somebody doing this.  As I recall, the
	person was getting away with around $10-20K a year with the scam
	(not quite "megabucks", but still pretty healthy).

	The roundoff error was pretty much invisible to the auditors.
	The tricky part for the crook was actually writing the check (or
	funds transfer) so he could collect the money.  This was what
	showed up on the books someplace and resulted in him getting
	caught.

	There are exceptions.  During the fifties a military clerk
	working for the NSA had a wreck in his hydroplane.  Since he had
	access to a lot a top secret data they assigned an agent to
	watch over him while he was under anesthesia to ensure that he
	wouldn't babble anything.  It wasn't until later when he
	disappeared and moved to Moscow that anyone thought to ask how a
	low paid clerk could afford to buy a hydroplane.

	I've resisted for many days, but I give up.  My friend Doug used
	to work in a bank, in the OLD days.  Their master file was on
	punched cards, with FOUR accounts per card.  After Doug had
	programmed the daily update and put it in production, the bank
	examiners came to him saying, "We have noticed a drop in
	revenues in the minimum-balance account."  Doug explained his
	program:  "...and when the average balance for the month is
	below the minimum, the surcharge is applied."  They said, "No,
	no!  When the current balance has EVER fallen below the minimum,
	the surcharge should be applied."  Doug said that didn't seem
	very fair, but they made the rules and he would fix the program.

	Months later, the examiners came round again, quite
	suspiciously.  They told him that they had noticed another drop
	in revenues in the minimum balance account.  Doug explained that
	he had fixed the program, but he would surely look into the
	matter right away.  After examining his program again, he went
	into the computer room to check the actual deck of cards that
	the operators used.  He soon discovered the problem.

	He had added four patch cards to the end of the deck, one for
	each account on a master file card.  Three of them were gone.
	It seems that as the deck was used day after day, the last card
	had gotten grubbier and grubbier.  Eventually, the card reader
	would not feed it.  But the program seemed to work fine anyway!
	Then the new last card died, etc.

	The bank examiners were satisfied.  Doug was relieved.  And now
	we all know that patching is not the right way to go.

	A fellow I worked with once told me a horror story that happened
	when he was working as an operator at MIT.

	The system they were using had recently been converted to using
	a new type of coated fiberglass disk, to replace the old, heavy
	metal-platter kind.  No problem there.  Well, the system they
	had this "Emergency Stop" plug on it that you would pull when an
	emergency occurred (they assumed it was for, say, a flood in the
	machine room).  One late evening, a couple of the operators were
	sitting around being bored, and decided to see what would happen
	when they pulled "Emergency Stop".  Immediately after pulling
	it, they heard a strange sound in the disk cabinet.  Looking
	over, they saw an arm emerge from the side of the cabinet, on
	either side of a platter, and CLAMP down on the platter.
	Apparently, this wasn't made for use with fiberglass platters.

	They were picking splinters out of the walls for days.

	This disk drive got troublesome hardware glitches, usually just
	after the end of the "normal" working day.  Which, for the
	programmers, was prime time, of course.

	The glitches happened just when a very good-looking woman on the
	cleaning crew walked past the drive.  She usually wore tight
	slacks, and a longish blouse...  there was friction between the
	layers of clothes as she walked, and the static charge
	occasionally jumped to the disk drive.

	NBS was running version 6 Unix on a PDP-11/45 with four RL02
	packs.  It took nearly half a day to backup the system.  Half a
	day to copy four 10 megabyte packs?

	The operators (who didn't know any better -- they'd been given a
	canned procedure) were typing in DD commands to copy from one
	pack to another.  They were using a buffer size of ten BYTES....

	Ok, my two quickies...

	Several years ago I was working on a portable real-time system
	we had custom built (using an LSI-11/1, 4KB, home-brewed O/S.)
	There were two of them in the universe and were working hard on
	two separate research studies.  Filled my heart with glee when I
	went to lift mine and out of its guts poured several ounces of
	coffee...(not me, never found out who.)

	A couple of years ago I was drinking coffee in my favorite
	coffee shop (maybe I should just stay away from the coffee!)
	when their phone rang, they shouted from behind the counter that
	it was for me, there was an alarm going in one of the machine
	rooms and I should get right over there.

	Ran over to find an operator standing there with a finger on the
	Halon hold button, we had a two zone alarm going so it was about
	to dump the tanks (I remember the operator looking very pleased
	at their current career choice).  It didn't look like there was
	any fire, so I began running around pulling up floor tiles
	(after, of course, disabling the fire system) looking for the
	offending sensors, 90Db going off in my ears.  Suddenly I notice
	this bad stinging pain in my arm, great I'm thinking, the big
	one, just what I need to finish a perfect day.  Well, it wasn't
	that bad, fortunately someone else in the room noticed the bee
	on my shoulder...

	I could go on.

	Speaking of 7094s, I once worked at an installation that had two
	of these.  The "console printer" on these computers was a large
	machine that looked (and maybe was) a 407 accounting machine.
	The 7094 didn't have any kind of internal clock but the 407 did
	and its patch panel was wired up so every time a line was
	printed on it, the time was appended at the right margin.  Thus
	elapsed time of a job could be determined by looking at the time
	printed when the $JOB card was printed and when the EXIT message
	was printed.

	Someone found out, however, that the timer did not advance while
	printing was in progress, so the times were a little inaccurate.
	To get a free run on the computer, all you had to do was keep
	the 407 continually busy and the timer would never advance.  A
	program could issue a print to the printer every so often (not
	very often due to the slowness of the printer) and never be
	billed for a cent.  It did drive the operators crazy though
	because everytime a line was printed on the 407, they went over
	to look to see if it was telling them something significant to
	the running of the job.

	A while back I was the tech support person for a minicomputer
	OEM.  Our customers were located all over the SF Bay area, we
	were located in Sunnyvale.  Since the customers were spread
	around, I usually tried to diagnose and fix problem over the
	phone.

	One day a Berkeley customer called me to complain that there
	were sparks and bad smells coming from the computer.  I assured
	him that that was ridiculous - computers don't generate sparks.
	He said that it sure did - every time he tried to plug in his
	modem.  I told him to try it again while I was on the phone, so
	I could try to diagnose the problem.  He laid the phone's
	handset on the table rather than putting me on hold (it wouldn't
	reach over to the computer, but it was in the same room).
	Things were quiet for a few seconds, and then I could hear a
	loud yelp that made its way across the computer room and through
	the phone.  He came back on the line and said the computer had
	bit him.

	Clearly, this was an on-site job - not something I could
	diagnose from his description - so I drove up to Berkeley.  When
	I got there, I saw the flat ribbon cable that connected the
	modem to the terminal interface - the power wire was on the
	edge, and for the whole length of the cable the plastic
	insulation had melted off, leaving the bare wires.  Hmmm, I
	thinks to myself, what could cause such a thing?

	I whipped out my handy-dandy volt-o-meter and tested the outlets
	to which the various pieces of equipment had been connected.
	All were 110 volts -- looked good.  It finally occurred to me to
	check the polarity of the sockets -- and sure enough -- they
	were wired wrong.  It was a very old building, and whoever had
	done the latest wiring in the computer room was obviously no fan
	of consistency.  The modem and the computer tried to share a
	common ground, but in reality there was a whopping potential
	difference between them, and when they were hooked up, sure
	enough, the computer generated sparks and bad smells --
	something computers are not generally supposed to do.

	Okay, one more computer "horror" story -- this one's kind of

	whose "computer expert" was in his 60's.  We had a program
	called "Biosum" that would calculate the biorhythms for two
	people and add the sine waves together and tell you how
	compatible the two people are.

	The day of the biggest demo, the customer brings in his mother
	(head of the clan) to see what the company is going to be
	shelling out their money for.  The customer wanted to show his
	mother something fun on the computer, so we fired up Biosum.
	Unfortunately, the mother had been born in the 1800's, and you
	know how sloppy BASIC programmers are when it comes to date
	conversions - especially 18 year-old programmers who think "20
	years ago" qualifies as ancient history.  When the program asked
	for her birthdate and she typed it in (she was just starting to
	get a thrill out of the machine), the program crashed very
	ungracefully.  Talk about embarrassing...

	They bought the system anyway, but I don't think the matriarch
	ever really liked it.

	This story did not happen to me, and I disremember where I heard
	it, so it may not be true, but it's interesting nonetheless,
	so...

	There was a computer system that was experiencing intermittent
	power failures that were proving impossible to track down.
	Every means of recording device and electrical filter was used,
	but to no avail.  The power failures always seemed to happen
	soon after lunch time, but for no apparent reason.  After months
	of agonizing work, the technician finally figured it out:

	The room on the other side of the wall from the computer room
	was the men's bathroom.  The grounding for the computer room
	circuits went to the water pipes that serviced one of the
	toilets.  The building was rather old, and the toilets were in
	some need of repair.  It seems that when one sat on the toilet
	seat, the weight of the sittee would cause the whole
	construction to lean forward a bit - not much, but enough to
	cause the marginally attached grounding wires to separate from
	the water pipes as the pipes bent along with the toilet - voila
	- the computer re-boots.

	I bet that was a hard one to track down!

	I know of a case where a spider decided to set up shop a few mm
	in front of a CCD array.  The spider rapidly figured out that
	the inside of an imaging device wasn't a very good restaurant
	and left -- but only after depositing a few strands of spider
	silk.  One of these strands would periodically interrupt the
	optical path of the CCD causing interesting images.  Of course
	this was an intelligent machine, so no one ever looked at the
	raw images -- not for at least a week that is...

	Pat Hume, one of the very senior profs in CS at U of T, once
	told the story of how he broke the FERUT.  FERUT was FERranti U
	of T, one of the first computers in Canada -- a great
	vacuum-tube monster.  It had something like a ten-step procedure
	for powerdown.  From time to time this machine got modified.
	One day Hume was the last user of the day, and the time came to
	shut it down.  Somebody had added an extra step to the shutdown
	procedure, presumably as the result of some modification, but
	either the writing was illegible or the instructions weren't
	clear.  He did the best he could, and smoke started coming out.
	He hastily finished the powerdown procedure, and called
	Ferranti.  They naturally said "your service contract is nine to
	five, we'll be there tomorrow morning".

	Next morning, the Ferranti technical crew showed up and spent
	all morning in the machine room.  From Hume's description, one
	got the impression of technicians half-inside the computer
	briskly hurling parts out.  Hume, a rather junior professor at
	the time, sat in his office all morning waiting for the word on
	the multi-million-dollar computer he'd broken.  People walking
	past in the hall would look in with pitying expressions.

	Towards noon, the Ferranti senior man walked into Hume's office
	with a double armload of parts, dumped them on his desk, and
	said "that's it".  Machine restored to operation, junior
	professor not having to contemplate spending the next fifty
	years paying back its price...  But the really cute part was
	that the machine's reliability was markedly better after this
	episode.  He'd managed to apply just enough stress to blow out
	all the marginal parts.

	Here's another example of what steel wool in the wrong places
	can do to a machine:

	And yet another flooring story...

	(Being a hardware engineer at heart, I still shiver when I think
	about this one.)

	Seams there was a cleaning lady that was assigned to the floor
	that had the computer on it (a Zerox SIGMA 5 if it really
	matters).  Well, one day she decided that the heal marks in the
	raised tile floor just had to be cleaned up.  After seeing that
	the soap and wax did not take all the marks out, she then tried
	steel wool!

	The customer had to replace the whole machine.

	Since the cooling fans draw from the bottom, all the evaporating
	wax was sucked up through the machine.  The soft coating on the
	PC cards and backplane made a good home for all the small pieces
	of steel wool that flew by later.


	/ net.rumor / decwrl!moroney / Mar 19, 1986 /

	Yet another old classic war story.

	It seems that there was a certain university that was doing
	experiments in behavior modification in response to brain
	stimulation in primates.  They had this monkey with a number of
	electrodes embedded in it's brain that were hooked up to a
	PDP-11.  They had several programs that would stimulate
	different parts of the monkey's brain, and they had spent over a
	year training the monkey to respond to certain stimuli.

	Well, eventually the PDP developed problems, and field service
	was called in.  Due to some miscommunication, the field service
	representative was not informed of the delicacy of this
	particular setup, and the people running the experiment were not
	informed that field service was coming to fix the machine.  The
	FS representative then booted up a diagnostic system I/O
	exerciser.  After several minutes of gyrations, the monkey
	expired, its brain fried.

	The moral, of course, is "Always mount a scratch monkey."


	/ net.rumor / sdcrdcf!dem / Mar 21, 1986 /

	This was told to me by a fellow co-worker who worked for another
	large main frame manufacture previously.

	It seems they delivered a new machine to an overseas site and
	during installation every time they applied power to one of the
	memory bays they blew every circuit breaker in the computer
	room.  After resetting the circuits they again applied power to
	the memory bay with the same results.  Since this was a new
	machine they crated it up and shipped it back and got a
	replacement.

	When they got the damaged memory bay back the started to tear it
	down to fine the cause of the short.  Well what they found was a
	small hole about 3/8 in.  in diameter going from top to bottom
	through some of the memory arrays, which cause a very effective
	short.  After a lot of research they found the cause.

	It seems that after the memory had passed test and evaluation
	and quality assurance the bay was crated and put in the
	warehouse to await delivery.  At some time during its storage an
	electrician was hired to do some work and since it was a secure
	building the security guard had do go with him.  The electrician
	at one point said that he had to go back down to his truck to
	get a drill and the guard asked why and the electrician said he
	needed to drill a hole right here (pointing to a spot on the
	floor).  The guard then responded by pulling out his sidearm and
	proceeded to blow a hole at the appropriate spot which happened
	to be right above where the memory bay was being stored.

	The last he knew the guard had been reprimanded and re-assigned
	to another of the security agency's customers.

	This reminds me of a nasty accident I had in the Power
	Electronics Laboratory.  I had a terminal connected to a
	6809-based microcomputer board.  The board was in turn connected
	through an interface, driver circuit and isolation transformer
	to an SCR power module.  The module was connected directly to
	the 117-volt line, which was protected by a 50-amp breaker.

	In the course of debugging the circuit, I had connected an
	oscilloscope -- isolated, of course -- to the circuit.  I
	connected one channel, with its ground wire, to some point in
	the power circuit.  I had other channels of the scope connected
	to the microcomputer interface.  I understood that the
	microcomputer ground now became hot, but this was okay since the
	microcomputer power supply and terminal were both isolated -- or
	so I thought.  Then I turned on the 50-amp breaker switch to
	energize the power circuit.  BANG!!!

	A large current, enough to pop the 15-amp breaker supplying the
	computer and terminal, went from the power circuit, through one
	set of scope leads, through the scope, through another set of
	scope leads, through the computer ground trace, through the
	ground wire in the RS-232 cable and into the terminal.  The
	goddamn terminal had its RS-232 signal ground strapped to the
	earth ground in the 117-volt line.  The current blew a trace on
	the computer board.  When it finished off that path, it
	proceeded to find the path of next lowest resistance -- the line
	driver and receiver chips in the computer board and the
	terminal.

	All four chips, plus some TTL chips in the terminal, were burned
	out.  But one of those chips had a hole blown right through it!
	I could see remains of the substrate through the hole.
	Fortunately, the 15-amp breaker tripped before anything else was
	damaged.  But the 15-amp breaker was slightly damaged -- it
	tends to stick a little upon turning on.  (I left my mark in the
	lab.)

	All of this goes to prove that that third wire in the line cord
	does not always promote safety.  In this case, it created a
	hazard.  From now on, I will always use a ground cheater for
	terminals when working in that lab.

	I have two quick but nasty stories.  These are true so for
	everyone who has been defending horror stories in net.rumor by
	saying there all folk lore, sorry.

	Back in the summer of '84 I was setting up a PC lab at my
	school.  We were converting an old chem.  lab, and of course had
	to make some major modifications, including installing air
	conditioning to handle the heat.  After setting up about 50 Dec
	Pro 350s we had the normal break in trouble but soon everything
	settled down and ran fine until about mid October.

	I came in one Saturday morning to open the lab and found it a
	little warm, but didn't think anything about it.  After cramming
	close to 100 freshmen into the lab to work on their homework,
	the temperature reached close to 90 and 3/4s of the machines
	were down with random hardware errors.  Seems that building
	services had decided on Friday afternoon that it was time to
	turn off the air conditioner, and fire up the heat for the
	winter.  They had of course locked the door behind them, and we
	had riveted all the windows shut that summer to prevent theft.
	The whole lab was down until late Monday when we finally
	convinced building services that we would need our air
	conditioner all winter.

	The cause of the second one was a little more difficult to find.
	Recently one of our customers was having trouble with a group of
	terminals getting periodic line noise, sometimes to the point of
	locking up the comm processor.  After finding nothing wrong in
	the hard or software a team of crack support people went to
	site.  There they found a bunch of RS232 lines almost 600 ft.
	long that ran through an elevator shaft.  Every time the
	elevator came by with it's big electric motor on top the RS232
	line would pick up the RF noise like any good antenna and drive
	the comm board insane.

	The most amusing incident I've ever heard along these lines (I
	*think* I read it in the book _Computer_Crime_) involved a guy
	who modified a payroll program for his large company.  The
	program processed an alphabetically-sorted list of employees, so

	then make the results into a check for the last guy in the list
	-- which happened to be one he had set up with his mailing

	something like that.  Anyway, his employer decided to do a
	morale-boost/public-relations move by awarding a trip or
	something neat like that to the first and last employee in the
	personnel/payroll database....It didn't take them long to link
	the non-existent employee at the end with the programmer in
	question.


	/ net.rumor / ajs / Mar 29, 1986 /

	This is the truth as I know it, but with enough mystery to
	constitute rumor.

	Back in college I knew a real whiz, the sort of guy who cut his
	computer classes because he was off consulting for Large Unnamed
	Companies, but passed them anyway.  Well, once he showed up with
	a substantial bandage on his elbow, covering stitches, after
	being gone a couple of days.  He wouldn't say much, only that
	he'd been standing too close to a disc drive when it exploded,
	and that his job was destructive testing.

	Later he told me a story of how he'd purposely blown a large
	system, which the experts at the company said couldn't be done,
	as part of this testing.  He said he downloaded some software to
	a system in a locked room thousands of miles way, and saw the
	results on closed circuit TV.

	The system had a CPU in the middle and a line of disc drives on
	each side.  He claims he caused the drives to blow up, starting
	at the outsides and working in, at just the right times to
	propagate a combined shock wave into the CPU.  If that wasn't
	enough, just as the shock wave arrived, he had the CPU power
	supply do something nasty which smoked the circuits.

	Apparently this was all production hardware, so naturally the
	company (supposedly one of the three-letter-acronym giants)
	didn't want word to get out.
	___________

	I think this guy was the same one who told me a gory story about
	a high-speed removable-cartridge disc drive with a cover
	interlock.  When the drive was spinning you couldn't open the
	cover.  The story is that the interlock was broken, but an
	operator didn't notice the disc was still spinning when he
	lowered a pack removal cover on it.  He was holding the cover by
	a center handle that immediately went to high RPMs, and you can
	imagine the rest.

	True story from my own past.

	I worked for a small business dp timesharing and software
	development firm in Stamford, Connecticut in 1976.  We were so
	successful in OEMing DEC PDP-11s with our business software that
	year that the owner decided to give himself a treat.  He moved
	out of his nondescript office suite and moved into a penthouse
	suite in a professional building.  In fact, he proudly
	announced, we'd be the highest point in Stamford and have a
	great view.

	Well, we moved in (quite a struggle since the elevator only went
	to the floor below) and started processing again, and within the
	weak started to notice a larger than usual number of soft
	crashes.  Then we had a hard disk crash.  Naturally we suspected
	that things had been jarred in the move or coming up the stairs.
	We had a FE come in and check it out and repair the disk.  The
	FE didn't find anything wrong.  The same thing happened the next
	week; we lost a hard disk and suffered numerous soft crashes
	which we tracked down to faulty disk reads.  FE came out, and
	looked for the problem and couldn't find it when all of a sudden
	he detects a surge on our power.  So, we are told we need a
	clean power line.

	Next week we have an electrician in and get a clean line pulled
	up 14 stories.  But still we have these hard and soft disk
	failures.  Frustrated, we have the FE call in a specialist.  The
	specialist comes in doesn't find anything right away, then
	suddenly "blip" detects a surge on our ground!?  So, they tell
	us we need a clean ground.  We get an electrician and tell him
	this, and he looks at us strange but puts in a new ground.  Next
	week same thing; lots of soft disk errors and this time we lose
	two platters on our 11/45 (recently arrived 11/03 with only
	floppy disks is cruising just fine though).

	We're really frustrated now, our MTBF (which we report to our
	customers in the monthly service level report) is in the toilet!
	The owner is hot about this.  DEC local FE and specialist can't
	figure it out.  Finally, they call in an engineer from Mass.  He
	strolls through our front door walks over to where the 11/45
	(including disks in same cabinet) is, right next to the window.
	He doesn't even look at the computer, just stares out the window
	for a few seconds.  Finally, he turns to us and says,
	"Interesting, by the way, can you tell me what those antennas
	are for?"  as he points out the window at the other side of the
	roof.

	"I don't know, just TV antennas I guess" says my boss.  The
	engineer asks us to call maintenance just to check.  Meanwhile
	this engineer is showing the local FE and specialist how he can
	get blips on his scope from the venetian blinds, his tie clip
	and just about everything else.  Turns out the antennas were
	microwave and radio paging antennas.  This being the high point
	in Stamford made it an ideal site (in fact the antenna rented
	for 10X the price of the penthouse suite!).  Everytime some
	doctor was paged in Stamford, the antennas would send out a
	signal that induced a current in everything around.  Being only
	20 feet away everything in our office was hit especially in our
	hard disks which used a magnet and induction coil to position
	the heads over the proper track!  Some signals would cause the
	head to over or undershoot the specified track causing the soft
	crashes, while others cause the head to actually hit the
	platter.  The floppies on the 11/03 weren't affected because
	they didn't use induction coils.

	They had to move the office down to the first floor where it had
	a view of...  the parking lot!  (However, in fairness to the
	11/45 and its disks I must also say that it later did a long
	stint at one of our customer's sites, in a "Polyfill" factory.
	The fibers in the air were so thick that the filters on the air
	conditioner had to be cleaned daily or it would actually burn
	out--but the 11/45 and disks functioned smoothly (I, however got
	a raging sore throat and sometime will find I have some lung
	disease!))

	I once got to visit the data processing shop for Frito-Lay
	headquarters in Dallas, Texas (there's a Dallas in Oregon, too,
	you know).  They are a huge IBM shop...

	The favorite war story at Frito-Lay was about the arrival of a

	see what look like liquid cooled heads from a modern motorcycle.
	In any case, the machine literally melted down one night.

	It seems a customer was having trouble with the floppy drive on
	his 9836 computer.  He would write his files to disk every night
	before he went home to find the next morning the disks were
	unreadable.  This went on for a few weeks so he decided to call
	HP.  After the usual telephone interrogation the CE decided he
	would have to go on-site.

	The CE tried to read the customer's floppy to no avail.
	Assuming a damaged disk, they tried a new one.  To test the
	drive the CE initialized a new floppy, installed it into the
	drive, wrote a file only to read it back perfectly.  Being a
	good CE he cleaned the heads on the disk drive, ran the
	diagnostics and sure enough, everything looked fine.  Since both
	he and the customer were satisfied no problem existed, they
	decided the disk PM was worth the trip.

	The next day the customer called the CE back because his disks
	were unreadable.  The CE went back to the customer site and
	again, the disks were unreadable.  He reviewed the command
	sequence used to create the files and all was correct.  They
	cleaned the heads again, ran the diagnostics only to discover no
	problems.  A new, initialized floppy worked fine.  Just in case
	the diagnostics had gone awry, the CE, over the next couple of
	weeks, began to replace parts of the two drives.  (Intermittent
	problems are always the most difficult to expose.)  Finally the
	customer had two brand new drives only to find he could not read
	his disks.

	The CE, becoming very frustrated, asked himself,"If I were a
	floppy disk why would I become unreadable?"  EUREKA!!

	It seems that every night, so that he would not forget to bring
	his files to work the next day, the customer would put them in a
	convenient place-right next to the door.  HE HAD THEM STUCK TO
	THE FRIDGE WITH A MAGNET!!  Of course the CE checked the
	immediate area of the computer for anything magnetic, but who
	would have thought...

	Subject:  IBM 3270 myths
	Date:  28 Jan 89

	I started there:

	1) A computer kept crashing, and every time service was called,
	it worked fine.  It turned out that one of the users would come
	in, sit down at the console and put his papers and stuff on the
	top covering the cooling vents.  When it crashed, he'd pick up
	his stuff and leave, removing the evidence.  Service people
	didn't figure this one out until they decided to watch him work
	to see why it crashed.

	2) We had an IBM cluster controller controlling some 3270
	terminals.  We paid $5000 for an upgrade that would allow more
	users to be connected to the controller.  The IBM service rep
	came in and REMOVED a board, that was put there to deliberately
	slow things down.

	3) (This one happened to me) A Northern Telecom 3270 terminal
	caught fire, with flames coming out of the top.  I guess I was
	doing some hot stuff.  I was not putting stuff on top of the
	terminal cooling slots.

	4) Somebody working on an Airline Reservation System, trying to

	Date:  31 Jan 89

	...the GE 415 and 425 CPUs were identical except that the 415
	had an extra wire that slowed the clock down a bit.  To upgrade
	to the 425, after paying your money, the wire was removed.  Some
	users knew about this and one of them made up a realistic
	looking letter supposedly from GE saying something to the
	effect:  "CAUTION.  Do not remove the wire from pin 4AB to 7FL
	in the CPU enclosure.  This wire is located approximately 7
	inches up from the bottom of the backplane in bay 2 and should
	not be removed by using a GE 112-3 wire unwrapping tool, first
	not removing the wrapping from 4AB, then pulling the wire from
	under the other wiring to its bound end at 7FL, followed by not
	unwrapping the bound end from 7FL.  Not removing this wire will
	result in the normal clockspeed which is 1.6 times slower than
	with the wire removed and will not cause corresponding increases
	in system throughput."  Naturally most of these wires got
	removed.

	Another interesting but kludgy fix to a problem came from a user
	of an IBM 7044.  The 7044 had a HALT instruction that stopped
	the CPU clock.  The user was doing some realtime processing or
	something of the sort and didn't like the idea of the CPU ever
	being able to stop itself.  He asked IBM how much it would cost
	to disable the instruction and they gave him some large quote
	which contained the implicit message "We don't want to do it and
	this price is set high enough to make you change your mind about
	the request."  The user didn't want to pay the money so he fixed
	up a photodiode over the light on the console that was on when
	the CPU was running and hooked it up to a solenoid that would
	push the RUN button whenever the light went out.  The cost was a
	couple of dollars.

	How about the young computer salesman giving some client a
	demonstration of the new electronic word-processor?  He loads up
	a large document, and says:  "watch this!".  He hits a couple of
	keys, and converts every "i" in the document to an "a", making
	the text unreadable.

	"And it you can change it all back, just like this" he
	proclaims, subsequently converting all "a"s back to "i",
	including those that had been "a"s originally.

	Of course, it happened to a friend of a friend of mine.. :-)

	Another one my father told me:

	My dad was an electronics engineer in Greece, for a company that
	imported various high-tech lab equipment.  One of them (A HP
	spectrophotometer, I think) was controlled by a special built-in
	computer, running optional proprietary software.  Each optional
	package was copy protected.  To enforce that, installing the
	package could only be done by a tech-rep; after the
	installation, the disks were automatically erased, and the
	program was kept in battery-backed RAM.

	Anyway, at some point the computer lost all its programs.  A
	call had to be made to Germany, for new disks to be sent as a
	replacement.  My dad could not find the reason for this, and he
	was really surprised when the client called again, with the same
	problem next week.  Call Germany again, install the disks again,
	then next week guess what happened:  The lab calls again.  But
	there was a definite pattern:  The lab always found the system
	down on a Wednesday morning.  Obviously, whatever went wrong
	happened on Tuesday nights only....

	After more than a month of downtime, someone realized that the
	cleaning lady came to the room every Tuesday night.  Someone
	went to check her and found out that she carried a nine-year old
	kid with her.  The kid had discovered the machine's on-off
	switch, with a few buttons next to it.  When the machine was on,
	pressing those buttons made cute sounds (audible warnings!)
	which are supposed to alert you to the fact that holding the
	button down for a few seconds would completely reset the
	machine.  I guess the kid thought of it as an oversized musical
	instrument.  The mom turned the machine off before she left,
	erasing error codes etc.  No-one knows how much this story cost
	the lab in downtime.....

	I have two stories to relate.  Both have to do with IBM machines
	(the large variety):

	1) Back when core memory was in use one could "listen" to the
	   memory with a transistor radio.  A game among system
	   programmers was to access memory in such a manner as to
	   produce recognizable tunes on the radio.

	2) Printers produce a buzzing with varying frequency depending
	   on the text being printed (this is because of the rate at
	   which the hammers strike the slugs in the print chain).  The
	   same system programmers would also compete to see who could
	   print a job that played specific (and known) tunes.

	One further story that comes to mind.  It is said that specific
	models of IBM mainframes had a bug whereby "branching backwards
	over a page boundary to a paged out page would leave the
	supervisor bit turned on in the PSW in the stored PSW".  I never
	was able to verify this but it makes some sort of sense when you
	look at the hardware that IBM uses.

	quantitative and with little background in statistics."  ( I
	hope this is no longer true of MBA's.)

	Anyway, writing such an interface in FORTRAN IV was no picnic,
	but I tried to make it very friendly.  Plain English questions,
	examples of correct answers, range checks to determine validity
	of responses, helpful error messages.

	One of the first users to test the program said that it kept
	bombing out on question 3.  "Enter number of thingamabobs (Valid
	responses 1 to 5):".  I asked what her response had been and she
	said "Five".  Puzzled, I asked if I could watch her run the
	program.  This is what I saw:  ....(Valid responses 1 to 5):
	FIVE

	That's when I realized what nonquantitative really meant.  Even
	though FORTRAN IV had no character string handling capability

	early in the evening to go barhopping and rabble-rousing, as NT

	Next morning they came in only to find that the switch had
	failed during the night, and a couple of circuit boards were
	fried to boot.  They replaced the boards, tested it all day, and
	left again that evening.  Next morning, same result.  This went

	bunked down next to the DMS-10.  Along about midnight, in came
	the cleaning lady with a feather duster, and proceeded to dust
	everything in the room, including the exposed circuit boards.

	UNRELATED STORY:

	When I was an undergrad at UNC, I spent a little time in the
	graduate department's graphics lab.  When one of the grads was
	showing us the hardware, he pointed out a large rubber mallet
	sitting beside one of the cabinets.  He said that the connection
	between the chips' prongs and their sockets sometimes became
	poor, and often when the system acted up the cure was to bang on
	the cabinet with the mallet to reseat the chips.  He also said
	anytime they had a photo of the lab taken, they made sure the

	    Just before he left, the C.E.  asked the secretary, "What
	    must you do every Friday?"  to which the secretary replied
	    "Copy my data disks so I don't lose any information."
	    Satisfied, the C.E.  departed.  One week later there was a
	    phone call; "I can't read my disks!"  so the C.E.  went back
	    to the secretary.  Sure enough the data disks were corrupt
	    and unreadable.  "Have you got copies of these disks?" --
	    "Yes" -- "Can I see them please?"

	    The secretary opened her desk drawer and removed several
	    sheets of paper.  Curiously the C.E.  examined them to see
	    each was a perfect photocopy of the data disks....

	2.) A site had an HP3000 installation with a number of large
	    300Mb disk disk drives.  One week, two of the drives
	    crashed, so they called an engineer.  The engineer examined
	    the drives, and noticed a little pile of sawdust on the
	    floor by the side of them.  Needless to say, there is no
	    wood in the construction of these drives and the floor was
	    concrete.

	    The engineer repairs the drives and leaves, sorely vexed.
	    The same thing happens a couple of days later - same two
	    drives crash, engineer calls, sawdust, etc.  This pattern
	    repeats until one day they notice a maintenance man, who has

	Fortran-IV (more dating (-:  ), TKB would do intense things to
	the drive, which was fragmented beyond belief.

	This tended to upset the system manager, one Mark Googleman, no

	Since two hackers on one machine naturally tend to competition
	(could you crack into the machine, get priv'ed, and log the

	embarrassed when confronted with the proof that this was my
	fault, I naturally bluffed my way out explaining that I was
	doing on purpose.

	Well, one thing led to another, and it became a ritual to leave
	taped papers to the floor with one's name on it in the computer
	room.  The object was to spend as much time from 9:00pm until
	7:00am WITHOUT ENTERING THE COMPUTER ROOM, running programs,
	doing TKB's etc, in order to move the RP's in a fixed manner.
	In the morning, the person with the disk drive closest to their
	name won the pool of money.

	I had slowly become the "hardware champion" until one day Mark
	managed to program the tape drive for Christmas carols...  sigh,
	I was so devastated that I didn't even take up his challenge to
	make the RP's perform accompaniment......

	The headline would be:  UNIX crashes IBM system.

	It seems that we had obtained an UNIX system and were using it
	for the first time.  In those days UNIX was brand new and the
	rest of the world had never heard of it.

	Any rate, we had attached our PDP-11/45 to an IBM 370-155 system
	running JESS-2.  This meant the PDP-11 pretended to be a RJE
	card-reader/printer/punch station.  Things were going quite well
	and the Bell Labs software worked great.

	Then one day we found that our RJE line was disconnected and the
	IBM people refused to allow us to talk with the IBM machines.
	The reason, they claimed, was that most of the time that UNIX
	submitted an RJE job the IBM would promptly crash with no error
	report.

	Finally it was determined that when the IBM people had sysgen'd
	the line they claimed it was a 2780 with a 80 character line and
	we were a 2770 with a 132 character line.  This didn't cause
	problems unless our line and the next adjacent line both
	submitted jobs at once.

	But I thought it amusing that DEC equipment could crash an IBM
	system at will.

	I have not witnessed this one, but some of my friends did.

	Some computer-illiterate visitors were shown the CDC6400 at the
	Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  One of them asked, how does the
	machine do all these wonderful things?  Their guide joked that
	it has a small man inside.

	While he was speaking, a CDC technician (the late Rachmim Moreno, a
	small man indeed) had just finished some routine maintenance and
	stepped out of the machine.

	Another story, which took place on April 1st 1984:

	I was requested to present Unix software tools to the Software
	Workbench undergraduate course.  After talking about grep, SCCS,
	lex and what not, I described an experimental expert system that
	creates applications by combining UNIX tools.  Given an English
	description of an application, the system produces user manuals.
	Given an ``O.K.'', it would go on and produce the actual
	software.

	The system was a success:  it kept some of the students busy for
	a long time.  Here it is, reconstructed from memory:

	#!/bin/csh -f
	echo "What should your application do?"
	echo "Type a short description followed by a control-D"
	cat > /dev/null
	echo "Working... here is the user's manual:".

	Subject:  Altering the memory test
	Date:  7 Feb 89

	There's another great story involving computers-that-have-
	lights.  This one involves Ivan Sutherland, co-founder of Evans
	& Sutherland (the pioneering computer-graphics firm), developer
	of Sketchpad (the very first computer-graphics tablet device, I
	believe), and winner of the "Father of Computer Graphics" aware
	some years ago.

	While in college, Sutherland worked with one of the very
	earliest Von Neumann architecture (stored-program) computers...
	I've heard this specific machine referred to as "THE Von Neumann
	machine".  This computer had a very limited amount of memory
	storage.  Rather than using ferrite cores, RAM memory, or such
	modern devices, it used "storage tubes"...  tiny little CRTs
	similar in operation to the tubes used in some "storage screen"
	graphics terminals (anybody used a Tektronix 4010 lately?).
	These little devices would store a rectangular array of bits in
	each tube.  It was actually possible to SEE the bits by looking
	at the phosphor-coated target area in each screen.

	One of the disadvantages of this storage technology (aside from
	low capacity) is that the tubes have a limited lifetime.
	"Burn-in" eventually occurs (as owners of Tektronix storage
	scopes can attest) as the phosphor structure ages and breaks
	down, and eventually the tubes must be replaced.

	The engineers who maintained this computer had some
	special-purpose diagnostic programs, which would run "ripple
	patterns" through memory and would look for bit-patterns that
	weren't stored properly (a similar test is done when diagnosing
	memory problems in most computers).  With the Von Neumann
	machine, though, it was often possible to identify tubes that
	were on the way downhill, simply by looking at the array of
	tubes in the cabinet and seeing which ones had a dim or uneven
	appearance during the ripple test.

	One day, Sutherland [and a cohort, I believe] substituted a
	program deck of their own devising for the memory-test deck that
	the engineers used.  This substitute deck did not run the usual
	memory test; instead, it loaded a certain specific bit-pattern
	into memory and then halted the machine.

	During the next routine-maintenance period, the engineer reset
	the machine, booted the deck, and the program immediately
	halted.  Puzzled, the engineer reset and rebooted again, and the
	same thing occurred.  Suspecting that some portion of memory had
	failed so completely that the program could not run, the
	engineer opened the panel to the storage-tube rack.

	There, shining out at him in carefully-lit bits, was a
	four-letter word.

	A sign soon appeared in the computer room...  "Programmers will
	NOT mess around with the hardware-diagnostic program decks!"

	[Disclaimers:  it has been 15 years since I heard this story, so
	I've probably forgotten some of the details and have gotten
	others wrong.]

	Date:  6 Feb 89

	One time, in a college library, I ran across a book of computer
	folklore.  It had a story about a young whiz kid hired as a
	computer programmer, who didn't like the way that computer
	operators were ordered to blindly follow directions.  So he took
	a scratch removable disk pack apart, replaced the platters with
	phonograph records, and put it back together.  Then, from his
	terminal, he called for it to be mounted.  The operator could
	tell that the disk pack was different (plastic is lighter than a
	disk platter) but mounted it anyway, destroying a disk drive.

	In the late '60s, Georgia Tech went to a computer registration
	system.  In Spring, 1969, George P.  Burdell (the mythical
	Georgia Tech student created during the war years) was
	registered for every class on campus.  I've heard that he aced
	them all, too.

	Finally, in the early '70s, Georgia Tech installed a Univac
	1108, so we heard all the Univac stories.  One of the stories
	revolved around an operator, sitting sleepily at his computer
	console about 2am, watching the backups.  The status messages
	disappear from his screen, a large (CBS-style) eye appears on
	the screen, it winks, and then the screen pops back to normal.
	Those were the days of fast memory and memory mapped screens, so
	its possible...

	Just one more.  On that same Univac, a friend discovered a
	security hole.  It seems you could checkpoint (stop and save) a
	job to tape to, say, shut the machine down for maintenance.  You
	could later restart the job from the tape at the exact point you
	stopped it.  My friend discovered that you could checkpoint the
	job, change the privileged mode bit (guard mode, supervisor mode
	etc.  -- the thing that prevented students from breaking into
	the machine) to 1, and restart it -- as a privileged job.  He
	was found out, though -- operators became suspicious when they
	went from 0 checkpoints per month to several check-point tapes
	per day.

	...Aw shucks, we did this with a PDP-8.  The accumulator was
	displayed in fairly large incandescent bulbs on the front panel,
	which needed high powered drivers.  Turning the bits on and off
	made plenty of radio noise.  I've heard legends of PDP-9
	programmers who would routinely leave a radio on the console as
	a debugging aid.

	...There was a legendary card deck that, when run through an old
	electromechanical accounting machine, would print out an
	American flag while playing the Star Spangled Banner.

	Speaking of printers, here are two silly stories from about
	1969.  At that time they used 360/20s as RJE terminals to the
	360/91 mainframe.  The '91 crashed all the time, so while
	waiting for the '91 to come back up we would toggle in little
	programs from the console, or laboriously punch an up to 80 byte
	program on a card, then use the "load" button to read and start
	the program.  There was constant competition for the most
	interesting single-card program.  My best was an expensive mimeo
	machine that read in a deck of cards and listed it over and
	over.

	In one case, we experimented with the Universal Character Set
	buffer in the printer.  The 1403 printer had interchangeable
	print trains, but different trains would have different
	character layouts.  The UCS buffer told what character was at
	what position on the train.  When it printed a line, it would
	see what characters were at the right position, fire the
	appropriate hammers, move the train ahead one position, fire the
	appropriate hammers, and so on until the entire line was
	printed.  So as an experiment, we filled the entire UCS buffer
	with the same character, then printed lines of that character.
	It printed about a page and a half real fast, then the cover
	opened about half way (it automatically opened whenever the
	printer ran out of paper, to warn the operator and dump
	ever-present coffee cups on the floor) and then blew a fuse.  We
	cleared out.  It hadn't occurred to us we could blow fuses with
	software.

	In another case, we experimented with the carriage control tape.
	Things like "skip to new page" or "vertical tab" were
	implemented with a loop of paper tape that had 66 rows, one for
	each line on a page, and 12 columns.  You could do a skip to
	channel 1, and it would advance the paper and the tape until it
	found a hole in column 1.  By convention, column 1 was top of
	page, column 2 top and middle of page, but you could program it
	any way you want.  We tried various combinations and everything
	worked just fine until we tried a skip to channel 12.
	Unfortunately, there weren't any punches in column 12, so the
	paper just whizzed through the printer at full speed.  We pushed
	the printer stop button.  Nothing.  We pushed the CPU stop
	button.  Still nothing.  Finally the CPU System Reset button
	stopped the printer.  Being good ecologists, we fed the paper
	back into the feed box, then ran.

	Date:  9 Feb 89

	Back in the good ol' days of card readers, a game we discussed
	was how to obtain passwords.  Jobs were submitted by setting
	your deck of cards on a counter.  An operator would grab all the
	jobs on the counter, run them through the reader, and return
	them with their output later.

	We're talking CDC hardware here, so various combinations of
	6-7-8-9 or 7-8-9 punches indicated End of Job, or End of Record.
	Well, there was a magic combination (6-8-9?)  that was
	interpreted as "read binary, and ignore other control punches
	except the magic combination."

	So, the devious programmer submits two jobs, the first has a
	program to read binary data, followed by a 6-8-9 and (for the
	operator's consumption only) a 6-7-8-9.  The second job just has
	a 6-8-9 to switch the system out of binary mode.  The two jobs
	are placed on the counter is such a way that the first job will
	be the first one through the card reader and the second job will
	be the last one through the card reader, with other students
	jobs in between.  Viola', you've got a whole list of accounts
	and passwords.

	Of course, the operator might become suspicious when 10 jobs go
	in and only one comes out.  Or, he might scramble the order of
	the jobs left on the counter defeating the plan.  I'm not sure
	anybody actually did this, but it strikes me as an easy way to

	Subject:  Operating system comments
	Date:  9 Feb 89

	Another subclass of computer folklore is the occasional barbed
	comment that one can find when reading through source code.
	Operating-system programmers seem particularly prone to witty,
	shamefaced, or other slightly-off-center comments in their code.

	Some examples come to mind (some of the details may be
	incorrect; it's been a long time since I read any of this code):

	1) DEC RSX-11M (???)  operating system.  System fault handler
	   module.  If a bus-check fault occurs (indicating possible
	   hardware problems with some device on the bus), the O/S traps
	   to a fault-handler routine that tries to identify the
	   offending hardware and reset it.  If, while attempting to
	   recover from a bus-check fault, a second such fault occurs,
	   the system traps again...  this time to a routine which
	   simply masks off all processor interrupts and hangs in a
	   tight loop.  It's necessary to manually reset the machine to
	   unhang it.

	   The comment on the loop reads, "The death of God left the
	   angels in a strange position."

	2) There are a couple of comments in the output-symbiont (print
	   spooler) code in the old Xerox CP-V operating system.  At the
	   top of a long block of convoluted and otherwise undocumented
	   code, there appears a taunting:

		"See if you can figure out what I'm doing here."

	   Somewhat further on, there's a really dubious code-construct
	   (I don't recall just what was being done), adorned with the
	   comment:

		"I'm ashamed of this"

	3) In the synchronous-terminal (BISYNC) module in the CP-6
	   operating system's communications software, there's a routine
	   that constructs synchronous data blocks (the ones that start
	   out with the characters "syn, syn, dle", and so forth).  The
	   code comment reads

		"With a SYNC SYNC here...
		 and a SYNC SYNC there..."

	   The module is labeled "EIE_IO".

	4) A related module, which was responsible for driving the Unit
	   Record Peripheral printer, was labeled "Y@URP".

	Date:  8 Feb 89

	At Carnegie-Mellon, the standard carriage tape had an empty
	channel.  An easy way to get on the bad side of the operators
	was to use the right character as a FORTRAN print control
	character.  (The tape was designed so that the printer
	implemented nearly all of the FORTRAN carriage control
	features.)  It was never a problem until someone wrote a SNOBOL
	program and forgot to print a space at the beginning of each
	line.  The operator wasn't near the machine at the time and 1403
	fed the paper faster than it could stack!

	...I hereby claim the best sound of any printer music.  At
	Sanders Technology, a defunct company that pioneered the letter
	quality dot matrix printer, I decided to come up with some real
	music.

	After a disappointing start, I designed some fonts that were
	variable numbers of vertical bars in 1/2 inch wide characters.
	The printer's horizontal resolution was 0.001", better than
	laser printers, but not good enough for decent music.  I had to
	compute line spacings in 0.0001" units and round to the nearest
	0.001".  About an octave and a half would fit in a 2Kb PROM
	(this was before 16K ram chips made down-loaded fonts
	practical).

	Next I arranged "A Bicycle Built for Two", since that was the
	first song a computer ever played (you've heard it in the movie
	2001).  It also was a hack on Daisywheel terminals, our main
	competition.  It was impressive.  And attracted a fair amount of
	attention at the trade shows.

	I later did three Christmas carols, and even a version of Le
	Marseilles (sp?)  for a potential French customer.

	Since the only real language we had was Fortran, I wrote TECO
	programs to generate the font from a source file of frequency
	and character bindings, and another TECO program that read a
	simple music language and generated the lines of text needed to
	play the song.  Not only could I set the meter, the program had
	to reverse the order of the characters for the right-left
	passes.

	I still have two of those printers.  NH Mensa prints its
	newsletters on one.  Unfortunately, I'm running out of ribbons
	and the pins are beginning to crack.  Smart printer.  Does its
	own justification, handles proportional fonts, mixed fonts, all
	sorts of stuff.  Its control language is readable, inspired by
	runoff.  Between the printer, a CP/M system and a screen editor
	(written as a macro for a TECO variant), who needs an IBM PC?

	One of the design engineers at G.E.  kept an electric vibrator
	in his desk.  I think it was originally an engraver, not a
	massager or sexual vibrator.  Anyway, when we seemed to have
	intermittent problems in a machine he would plug in the vibrator
	and touch it to each circuit board in the suspect area while
	running a diagnostic program.

	At that time G.E.  had a small enough number of machines in the
	field such that when a customer's machine was in bad trouble and
	the regular field engineers couldn't fix it, the company would
	pull together a small group of engineers and programmers who had
	participated in the design of the hardware and software and send
	them to camp out at the site until the problem was solved.  So
	that's where the vibrator probably found the most use.

	My office-mate years ago at JPL lived through this:

	When the Viking Mars probes where launched, no one thought
	they'd last very long in Mars oribt, so the programs saved a few
	bytes by ignoring leap years and hardwiring 366 in (1976 was
	leap).  The next year everyone was called in to rewrite their
	systems for downloading to Mars with a 365 day year.

	Better yet, both spacecraft were still going strong in 1980 and
	most of the crew were long gone to other projects.  Everyone had
	to be called back for another download to Mars.  It pays to
	include leap year in your code.

	From personal experience:

	I remember a Lunar-Lander game written in PDP-11 TECO that used
	VT100 cursor keys.  The entire program looked like your terminal
	was at the wrong baud rate (standard TECO programming form).  It
	ran without change on the old PDP-10 still surviving at college
	and later on the brand-new VAX, as well as 3 different O/S
	versions of PDP-11 without change.

	From rumors of ancient DEC history:

	The system programmer group writing TOPS-10 used to love fancy
	TECO programs and had a weekly contest for them.  One guru
	working on FORTRAN compilers would read them carefully but never
	enter one.  They thought he was just concentrating on compilers.
	Then one week he submitted a macro that did FORTRAN compilation,
	complete with optimization.  The TECO program took days to run,
	but it worked.  Apparently he had written a PDP-10 instruction
	set emulator in TECO and feed the compiler to it!

	Actually, the print chains are not in alphabetical order.  They
	are magically ordered by some arcane formula.  Some of the
	printers are designed so that the hammer will strike the
	character just as the correct character is at the correct place
	in the line (the chain rotates at very fast speeds).  Often,
	many characters will get printed at the same time, and no more
	than 2 rotations of the chain are ever needed to print a line
	(which is why they are fast).  Presumably, the right set of
	characters on a line will cause all the hammers (132) to strike
	at the same time (while the chain is rotating).

	I had related a story like this to a friend in college and
	(unknown to me) had decided to try it.  He spent a night
	carefully going over the chain and determining the proper
	sequence to send.  The next evening, he decided to print his
	file, and had me watch (only one line was printed).  The job
	printed and we ran downstairs.  The printer was still rocking
	slightly.  Opening up the cover, the chain was still intact, but
	had come completely off the drive that held it.  We tore out the
	offending sheet of paper with the incriminating line (smudged
	and garbled) and complained to the operator on duty that the
	printer was broken again.  I don't think my friend ever tried it

	Voldi wrote in BASIC to run on an IBM PC (it actually was pretty
	nice for the price in spite of all this).

	I was there to help design a full CAD/CAM system to
	automatically write NC programs, but I still had to help support
	the old program.  Voldi put a few "undocumented features" in
	this program which he never told anyone about, including the
	president of the company (well...  I knew, but *I* wasn't going
	to say anything).

	In any case, one morning someone at a sheet metal shop far away
	(I think Atlanta), called a file f*ckoff or some such thing and
	the editor responded with, "My, are we having a bad day?  You
	really should try to relax more," or something like that.  The
	NC-programmer then called the president of our company (Carl)
	and said he had cussed at the computer and it had *answered*
	him!  Carl said, "No it didn't," and claimed over and over again
	that it couldn't do that.

	After he got off the phone he came into our office and started
	asking questions at which time Voldi and I both began laughing
	hysterically.  It took dozens of users about 8 months to notice
	this "feature", which had around 100 words that it recognized,
	and a few dozen responses including some that made the computer
	unusable for 10 to 15 minutes (like telling the user that it was
	formatting the hard disk).  Needless to say, the feature

	constructed of discrete transistors, as ICs hadn't been invented
	yet.  We're talking room size machines.

	The tape drives were a mix of transistors and vacuum tubes
	(6AU6's, 12AU7's on the picker cleat driver, 807's in the servo
	amps, I think).  Since the tubes needed a warm up period and the
	transistors didn't, the tape drive power supplies had a
	complicated startup sequence using some largish relays.

	One day, I got a call about a tape drive (transport in those
	days) that was acting very bizarre.  As soon as they hit the on
	switch, the tape reels would take off in opposite directions and
	stretch the 1" tape down to a little thread about 1/16" in
	diameter before it broke.  (The motors were slightly larger than
	a car's starter - no joke)

	The Alumni Records office desired to embed all kinds of

	When mailing labels were printed, both the key value and a

	top line of the label.  We ran out of space on the label.

	Not to worry!  This fancy computer (a "brand new" IBM 360/50
	running OS/PCP) could transform a numeric key value into an
	alphanumeric value by converting the alumni-record key from the
	too long base-10 number to a shorter base-36 number.  Just use

	call from the mailing house...

	"Our delivery man just returned from the Post Office.  They
	won't take your mailing.  It looks like somebody tampered with
	your list.  You better get down here right away!"

	There, on top of one of the trays of mail was a label with the
	converted alumni record identifier.  It read something like ...

		-------------------------------
	       | 123FUCK69A4       MM  43210** |
	       | MISS INGRID BEASLEY  EDU. 29  |
	       |   ...                         |

	The mailing was instructing Miss Beasley to mark all further
	correspondence to the office of Alumni Records with her "new
	computer identifier code" shown on the label.  Needless to say,
	the Office of Alumni Records failed to see the humor in it all.
	We thought that at her age, Miss Beasley (Edu.  29) might
	actually take the "computer's mistake" as a complement!

	Thereafter, we were instructed to add the "DIRTY-WORD-ROUTINE"
	which performed a table lookup of every word which a committee
	of about a dozen of the raunchiest people in the department
	could come up with.  But what about short phrases?  And how
	about maintenance of the table?  Whose budget does this come out
	of?

	A student programmer, invited to a meeting to "see design in the
	real world" made an unwanted suggestion.  Just convert to
	base-31 and don't use vowels.  It worked.  The next year, they
	changed the alumni records identifier again.  I graduated.

	...This posting brought back to mind my experiences with an SDS
	machine one summer at a NASA base I worked at.  I believe the
	machine was an SDS 930, but I may be mistaken.

	It did not like to have its main memory cabinet door closed
	(crashing after a few moments if anyone had the timerity to
	close it!), so it always sat there with one door partly open.

	It had a card reader that was interesting.  It read the cards
	length-wise (column 1->80) rather than width-wise (row 9->12).
	So, if the cards were a little out of spec (low bidder on a
	government contract), it would either read two cards at a time,
	or eat one card at a time.  When one was eaten you could recover
	it from inside the reader -- neatly folded into a many-creased
	accordian that was cute to look at but impossible to read.

	The previous poster also mentioned that their machine did not
	like to awaken in the morning.  Here at the Indian Hill location
	of Bell Labs we had one machine that did not mind awakening, as
	long as it was not Monday.  It hated Monday mornings.  It was
	one half of a duplex pair of IBM 360/67's.  Each Monday the
	machines would be IPLed and each Monday the Left Half would come
	up all ready to work, while the Right Half balked and struggled
	and refused to come up for at least another hour.  The Comp
	Center staff tried all kinds of things to try to cure or get
	around the problem (let it run all weekend, lie to it and tell
	it that Monday was Tuesday, etc.), but it had that habit as long
	as I can remember working on it.

	Date:  13 Feb 89

	On another level of computing, a couple of years ago I designed
	and built a board for my S-100 system that would treat
	Colecovision game cartridges as if they were mapped input
	devices.  This way I was able to read the object code onto disk
	and eventually into memory.  I would then dis-assemble the
	program to find out how they worked.  I don't recall which game
	it was, but near the end of the code was the text reading
	something to the effect of:

	"If someone at Atari is reading this, please say hello to Jim
	Pym."

	The name is made up, but you get the point.  Similarly, you
	could find some names scattered in the code that never showed up
	in the game itself, and I seem to recall (though I'd have to go
	back and check) someone actually including a love note in the
	code as a dedication.

	A computer repairman was one day called to a grade school to

	component within, i.e.  backplane, mother board and all other PC
	boards, housing walls, etc.  He had never seen any coating like
	this in any other computer.  The repair of the processor
	involved simply blowing out the dust.

	A few days later he was on another service call within the
	school for another computer.  Walking by the room that contained
	the unit he had previously fixed, he decided to peek into the
	room to see how it was doing.  What he saw explained the white
	dust.  He saw several boys beating the chalk board erasers next
	to the fan in the unit, and watching the unit suck the dust

	...Here's a folk tale.  The person who told me says he was
	there, and I believe him.

	Several/many years ago, when Tops-10 was the most exciting
	operating system at DEC (that is, before Tops-20), and when
	ANF-10 was considered networking (hmmm...  I guess it still
	would be), some interesting hacks were perpetrated.  My favorite
	two stories:

	The ANF-10 nodes were PDP-11's, some serving as terminal
	concentrators, some as front-ends to the 10's.  A person made
	some modifications to the code to run in the terminal
	concentrator version so that, if you asked to be connected to a
	node that wasn't currently available, it would respond "That
	node is not available.  Would you care to play Adventure while
	you wait?", and was in fact prepared to play adventure if
	requested.

	The "reverse video" hack:  this was done "to" a particular
	person that people didn't much like.  The terminal concentrator
	code was changed to make his terminal work backwards.  "Home"
	was the bottom right corner.  Carriage return returned you to
	the rightmost column.  Line feed moved you up a line.  And so
	forth.  The terminal escape sequences were parsed, interpreted,
	and reissued suitably modified.

	I probably once knew who the perpetrators (and victims) were,
	but it's all lost in the mists of time for me now.  Sorry for
	not giving proper credit.

	Evidently, the customer support person was still learning the

	up a photocopy of the tape (rather than a magnetic copy).

	We all got a laugh out of it.  To make things even better, the

	not enough information was supplied, and that we would have to
	ask the customer for the requisite info.

	Date:  12 Feb 89

	During the 1970's my organization used quite a bit of punched
	tape.  In fact, in a storeroom there are still about a dozen
	VERY expensive rolls of unused metallized mylar punched tape
	which we used for creation of, ahem, archive tape records.  The
	definition of "archive" media sure has changed, huh?

	We still have a thermal punched tape splicer, along with a rack
	that has a high-speed Remex tape reader and punch.  None of this
	stuff has seen use in at least five years, but I have not had
	the heart to order its disposal.

	I did, however, concede to changing times, and junked our
	Decision Data 8020 interpreting card reader/punch about 4 years
	ago when we axed an PDP-11/44.  I remember when that card
	reader-punch was ordered in 1974 at a cost of around $8K.  It
	was our only card device which was shared among development
	systems when necessary.  We even designed a custom interface
	using an 8080 with software driver so that it could run on
	either an 11/03 QBUS or on UNIBUS.  We wanted interpreting
	capability, in addition to having a standalone keypunch (which
	the 8020 would also do), so we never bought any native DEC card
	equipment.

	In one lab where we had two ASR-33's, which have now been gone
	for several years, a piece of oiled punched paper chad will
	STILL worm its way out of the baseboard moulding every once and
	a while.  Unfortunately, more than one chad box was accidentally
	dumped -- so the floor has been well "seeded" over the years.

	Then he went up to Chicago (?)  for a performance for an
	audience.  He picked up all the equipment on the stage -- it
	didn't work at all.

	So the next couple of hours he tried to figure out what is
	wrong, and the audience started to show up...

	But then, Aha!, somebody discovered that the external disk drive
	was placed on the left side of the Macintosh -- not on the right
	side, as it should according to the manual.  The Mac has its
	transformers on the left side, and their magnetic field
	interfered with the drive.

	So they moved the drive over to the right side, everything all
	of a sudden working perfectly, and the performance was carried
	in land.

	...A disgruntled employee at NavOCEANO (Naval Ocean Office, I

	Ocean R&D Activity) decided to get even with the locals.

	There was a large Univac installation there, and some
	ultra-high-speed card readers.  He hollowed out an entire box of
	punch cards (about 2.5 feet of cards, for all you youngsters)
	and filled them with old old old bananas.  He then submitted
	this deck as a job.  The operators were used to multi-box jobs,
	so they usually just picked up the entire box of cards and
	dumped them in the high-speed readers.  It took over 3 weeks of
	maintenance before the reader was working reliably again, and
	the control room reeked of banana for weeks afterwards...

	When crucial data on tape was lost at my university, the gurus
	in the computer room would retrieve as much data as possible,
	then fill in the gaps by soaking the tapes in a solution that
	made the individual bits show up as 1 or 0 (dark or light) under
	a magnifier.  They'd then hand-assemble the missing sections
	from the visual inspection.

	I once spent an entire night (over 12 hours) trying to get my
	compiler (working up to that point) to work again so I could
	work on it some more for my compilers course.  At the end, I had
	reduced the problem down to a program (C code) that basically
	declared an integer "i", said "i=5", then printed "i".  The
	program printed a floating-point number...  I was so angry I got
	the idiot who had been mucking around with the C compiler from
	Bell Labs in the lab at 7am on Sunday morning to fix the damned
	thing.

	Our aged PDP-10 finally died one weekend when we had an
	unusually hot Sunday (there was no operator support on Sundays
	until 6pm) and it turned out the fall leaves had never been
	cleared from the AC vents by the university physical plant.  The
	temperature got over 100 degrees F in the computer room, and the
	old CPU on the 10 wouldn't even whimper afterwards.

	No joke.  I have seen at least one letter sent to the software
	support group of a DBMS company that said, "I have included a
	copy of my disk as per your request," only to find a photocopy
	attached to the letter.  They did copy both sides, at least.

	This is the same company (my wife worked there) where an irate
	customer couldn't save his records to disk.  The error message
	he reported would only have appeared on a full disk, but he
	claimed that he checked the space remaining and it was "okay".
	Turns out that the program he ran to check remaining space on a
	disk drive returned the amount of free space, expressed in
	Kbytes.  A full disk, therefore, returned the string 0k (where 0
	= zero).

	Then there was the customer who complained because the new
	software release wouldn't print.  This customer just *knew* he'd
	caught the software company in a bug and he was demanding his
	money back.  My wife stepped through the whole process, set up a
	duplicate system on her end of the phone, and spent a fair
	amount of time duplicating his situation.  At last she
	determined that the only possible failure was that his printer
	wasn't on line.

	"I've managed to duplicate your error message," she finally told
	him after about three days of this.

	"Aha!  It *is* a bug, and you'll finally admit it!  Are you
	going to refund my money?"

	"Well, we'll see," she said.  "First, look on your printer and
	see if the little green light marked 'on line' is lit."

	"No, it isn't.  What does it mean if it's not on line?"

	"Well, it's like the lights are on but nobody's home..."

	In the early 1970's at Georgia Tech there lived a Univac 1108
	running under the Exec 8 operating system.  The 1108 had
	commands that began with an @, and they would hang up the
	terminal until you were done.  So, for example, an:

		@MSG,W Operator, please mount tape 1234...

	would send a message to the operator, but wouldn't return
	control to your terminal until the operator replied.  Anyway,
	some fellow at Univac got the idea of double-@ commands, which
	would allow you to play through while the single @ commands were
	working -- kind of like the & feature of Unix.

		@@MSG,W Operator...

	would allow you to go on, but required the operator to answer a
	console question.  After our "new" OS was installed, the Rich
	Electronic Computer Center published a bulletin about how to use
	this new feature.  Soon afterwards, a student filled a file with
	4K of these operator reply statements and started it...

	commodity brokers.  These things are their bread and butter:  if
	they don't work, they can't do *a thing*.  They thus tend to get
	frustrated easily.

	One of them calls, and says, "No matter what I type, it doesn't
	work".  Get the machine exchanged, the keyboard is hopelessly
	damaged.  A couple of days later, the same thing happens.  We
	discovered that the guy used his *telephone handset* to bang on
	the keyboard to flip pages.

	The competition -- obviously from similar experiences -- had
	keyboards encased in sheetmetal, with very tough springs; these
	people only hit one key at a time anyway, and didn't touch type,
	so that was OK...

	In a similar vein, a frustrated customer had, on a bad trade,
	*ripped* his console from the data feed -- the back panel was
	still hanging to the wall outlet.  We got bit by this again when
	we introduced mice on our systems:  now *they* were getting
	banged up by people using them do dial the phone!!

	To solve all these problems, we had to install routines to
	detect keyboard banging (lots of keys pressed too quickly in
	succession) and mouse banging (that took some work) and beep
	*real loud* -- they'd get embarrassed and not do it anymore.
	Abuse management -- a whole new area in user interfaces!

	One of the guys who used to work here had been a field engineer
	for many years.  (That means he used to repair computers.)  One
	of the machines he used to work on was one of those large
	beasties, about 5 feet high and six or seven feet long.  To get
	at the innards you opened up the hinged doors on the sides.  The
	"memory unit" was also hinged and to work on it you had to open
	it out so it was at a 90 degree angle to its normal position.

	Anyway, there was this particular machine that was getting
	_lots_ of memory errors.  But of course when they opened it up
	to test it, it worked fine.  They tried various things like
	cleaning the vents, cleaning the connectors and replacing
	various parts, but to no avail.  When the memory unit was folded
	out at a 90 degree angle it worked fine, when it was closed it
	got memory errors.  Finally, in desperation, they closed it up
	and turned the whole processor so that it was at a ninety degree
	angle to its original position.  Supposedly it never had a
	problem again.

	They explained to the customer that the machine had "East-West
	Memory".

	Several years ago I was working as an instructor at a computer
	camp.  I was assigned to teach the introductory class in TTL
	logic and peripheral design.  So there I was, explaining the TTL
	high and low states.  "Five volts represents the 'high' state or
	a binary 1, and zero volts represents the 'low' state, or a
	binary 0."  And I went on and on explaining the various TTL
	Gates (AND, NOR, NAND, etc).  Finally, I got to the Inverter (or
	NOT gate).  I explained that if you put 5 volts into it, you'll
	get 0 volts out, and if you put 0 volts into it you'll get 5
	volts out.  To this, one person replied:

	"Wouldn't that thing be awfully useful during a power failure?"

	Whenever we used to make major changes to our operating system
	or transaction processing system we were required to repeat a
	prior day's business to prove the the system was ready for
	production.

	Until about 10 years ago, we would do this by copying all the
	databases and tapes for a day and run a series of tests on
	Saturdays.  All the production terminal operators would be at
	their terminals typing exactly the same things that they had
	typed on the day being repeated.

	All this was very expensive and error prone.  Usually the tests
	would cause a crash a few minutes after they started.

	On one memorable day in 1976 the test was running very smoothly.
	The computer room was filled with onlookers:  operations people,
	systems programmers, bigshots, vendor representatives, etc.

	The console operator was continuously displaying the status of
	the system.  One common command was to display all the jobs in
	the system:

		$dj 1-999

	Everyone was pleased that the test was going so well until
	around 4 PM when all the jobs suddenly stopped running.

	Concern turned to elation when the console operator confessed
	that he had mistakenly typed:

		$cj 1-999

	Which *cancelled* all the jobs in the system!

	...The 4th-hand version of this story I heard regarded the first
	mounting of a large capacity disk drive on a ship.  The teller
	(known to occasionally exaggerate) claimed that the disk was a
	particularly high volume model for its era and was about three
	feet in diameter (I have difficulty believing this).  He claimed
	that the gyroscopic forces for such a large rotating mass were
	sufficient to warp the ship's decks as the ship rocked and
	heaved while underway.

	A first-hand story:  this one actually happened to me.  When I
	was a student at the University of Texas, I was employed at a
	computer lab programming one of the early generation desktop
	computers.  The machine was an 8080 (later Z80) CP/M machine
	with an S-100 bus in an IMSIA (sp?)  cabinet.  The IMSIA cabinet
	was about the size of a modern IBM-PC but about twice as high.
	The chassis was aluminum with a steel cover.  The power cord for
	the system entered the cabinet through the rear and was
	connected directly to a terminal strip (two parallel rows of
	screws in a heavy piece of bakelite).  The terminal strip was
	mounted on the backplane of the cabinet which was a sheet of
	aluminum about 1/8" thick.

	Well one day I was merrily typing away on a terminal when an
	hair-raising event occurred.  A jet of fire and sparks spewed
	out of the rear of the computer cabinet accompanied by brilliant
	ultraviolet light.  It was as though someone had started up an
	arc welder inside the computer.  The lab filled with ozone and
	smoke.  The welding continued for about a two full seconds
	before it ceased of its own accord.  It took a couple of minutes
	to get my heart out of my throat and get up the nerve to unplug
	the machine.  When I examined the computer I found a 3/8" hole
	in the aluminum backplane of the computer which had obviously
	been torched out.  The desk was covered with molten globules of
	aluminum which hardened into little pills.

	The computer lab was in a building filled with engineering labs
	which contained all kinds of heavy equipment.  Apparently one or
	more large machines had been switched on or off and a hell of a
	big power spike had come down the line.  Evidently one of the
	screws in the computer's terminal strip was just a little bit
	too long and the tip of the screw was just a little bit too
	close to the aluminum backplane of the cabinet which was
	grounded of course.  This closeness allowed the power spike to
	arc between the tip of the screw and the backplane.  The arc
	continued until the hole it was melting in the backplane grew
	too large to sustain the arc.

	The amazing part of this story was that the computer was
	completely unharmed save some cosmetic damage.  Even the fuses
	were intact (they were "downstream" from the terminal strip).
	Furthermore, the building fuse hadn't blown.  Basically, after
	about ten minutes to get my nerve back, I plugged the computer
	back in, cleaned the aluminum pills off my desk, and went back
	to work like nothing had happened.  Try that with your Taiwan
	clone!  (Later on I trimmed down all the screws in the power
	strip.)

	I was told the following story by a friend, but the details are
	probably mixed up -- if someone remembers them correctly they
	are welcome to put me right.  It happened at an ILA conference
	(those are the Hebrew initials of called in English), two or
	three years ago:  Some time after the conference began, a man
	came up hysterically to the DEC representatives (where DEC's
	display was on), and told them that the computer had crashed.
	Without even thinking, they told him, "Just reboot it then,
	what's the problem?".

	"No, you don't get it -- I was just unloading it from the van
	here, and..."  (I think it was a VAXstation, God rest its soul).

	I recall a story from the 1970's, told by a friend at the time,
	about a phone bill.

	The local phone company, NJ Bell, would include a keypunch card
	with your bill.  The card included the standard information
	about the customer and the bill amount.  This friend of mine
	took the phone bill card to keypunch and added an overpunch to
	the the bill amount making it a negative number.  He sent in a
	check for the regular amount with the altered card.  When he
	received his next month's bill there was a credit for his
	payment and a credit from his previous balance due.

	He never told me if the phone company ever caught on or not.

	When we were first porting UN*X to our hardware we often had
	crashes that would leave the file system in a state of disarray.
	Going through the fsck routine of being asked if we wanted to
	clear the file, etc., got to be a hassle.  So one of the
	programmers added a "-y" option to fsck that would print out yes
	to the question (so you could see what was going on),
	automatically clear the file in question and continue.

	It was very handy.  It cut reboot times down dramatically.
	Until the first time "/" was corrupted:  Directory "/"
	corrupted, do you wish to remove?  YES Directory "/" removed.
	"-y" was removed forthwith.

	The *old* Compucolor (or whoever Intecolor used to be) computers
	were pretty nice for writing neat games in; their BASIC was very
	flexible and graphics-oriented.  A friend (hi, Nick) at Tech and
	I were playing around, getting the computer to do all kinds of
	neat (to us, then) stuff, and Nick found a very obscure feature:
	ANY character could be placed in a comment.  So we wrote a
	program that did all kinds of neat stuff on the screen, and then
	stopped for a moment (with keyboard locked) displaying, "Read
	the code and see if you can figure this one out!"

	The memory mapped display was fast.  The code was as compact
	(i.e., spaghetti code) as we could make it, crammed onto 1 LONG
	line, followed by a comment that had as its first characters the
	ones to return to beginning of line and clear to eol, and then
	the following:

	10 REM Read the code and see if you can figure this one out!

	When you tried to print the source to the screen, it happened so
	fast the eye registered nothing but the final comment.  A lot of
	grad students (not to mention undergrads) wasted a LOT of time
	trying to figure this one out!

	DISCLAIMER:  So help me God, this is the absolute truth.  I
	should know, because I was there.

	Many moons ago (1982), I was on contract as a P/A to one of
	those credit card companies that shall remain nameless.  I was
	attached to the project that was completely rewriting the
	billing process.  The approved implementation included a massive
	number of database tables that the Credit Department would
	maintain to control their billing cycles, appearance of the
	statement for different types of customers, interest charge
	calculation, and so on, ad nauseum.

	Well, as the project trundled on toward completion, the end user
	became aware of the manpower effort that would be required to
	initialize all of these tables.  (In retrospect, their reaction
	was really quite excessive.)  Our illustrious Project Manager
	said at the time, "No problem.  We'll just promote the TestBed
	environment."  I'm sure that you can imagine our reaction, as
	the mischievous minds of programmers tend to generate humorous
	testing environments.

	Sure enough, despite all of the programmers's and testers's
	objections, the TestBed environment was promoted to Production
	"...with those changes that are deemed necessary by the Credit
	Department."  Apparently, they did not catch all of the
	"necessary changes" because in the first week, the Credit
	Department mailed 1,500 statements to delinquent customers with
	the Reminder Notice:  "Pay up, or we'll rape your wife."

	Judging by the memo that was distributed to the MIS Department
	following this debacle, the rest of the organization failed to
	see the humor in this.

	This reminds me of a particularly nasty trick we (myself and a
	fellow named Mike something) played in High School (1972?).  In
	our FORTRAN course all of the students's card decks were packed
	in boxes and shipped out to run at some magic computer elsewhere
	in the city; turnaround was about 2 days.  Well, Mike was
	somewhat of a system hack and had "discovered" that there was a
	way to read all other JCL (yep, IBM) in a deck as data.  We just
	had to try it out.

	I wrote a super simple parser (scan a line for READ, WRITE,
	DO...)  and an output formatter which did a fair job of
	duplicating the real compiler's output.  We just slipped the
	"special" JCL in at the start of the deck and viola...  the
	students received realistic looking compiles but with fake error
	messages like, "READ statement in wrong place" or, "You cannot
	WRITE here".  Well, the instructor just didn't know what to make
	of this (he was new to this stuff too) and we finally had to
	'fess up.  As I remember it I got one of my very few detentions
	for costing the class a whole computer run but it was worth it
	to see the teacher's face.
