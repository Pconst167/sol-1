     Compiled when I became frustrated while reading magazine
articles, help wanted ads and equipment for sale brochures....all
pertaining to computers....where the following Abbreviations and
Acronyms were used and their meanings were either not known to me
or were not immediately available.  I have actually seen these
combinations of letters used at one time or another in magazines,
newspapers or handbooks.  They apply to personal computers,
mainframes, communications, programming, networking, etc......you
name it.  The glossary is free for anyone to use, but with no
guarantees as to its completeness.  That is why I am now requesting
your help.  Look over the definitions and let me have your
feedback.  If you have ever seen letter combinations that you also
did not understand, please drop me a note at the address below.

     Also, if you find any errors, obsolete information or can
suggest any additions or deletions, they will be most welcome.  If
you can help, my thanks in advance. 

     In the meantime, print out a copy of this version and keep it
on your desk.  I know you will find it useful.  Updates to this
glossary will be issued three times a year; in January, May and
September.  You may download the latest version of BABEL from your
favorite BBS or from The Internet.  If any Bulletin Board SYSOP,
Club Librarian, Organization or Teacher sends me a formatted disk
with a disk mailer, stamped with return postage, I will return the
disk with the latest updated version of BABEL at no charge.  See
APPENDIX A for additional information regarding updates.
                    
     Letter groups followed with " * " were used before 1965.  At
some of these, I have noted historical information.  For a brief
interpretation of "smiley faces" and other informal expressions
used in electronic mail messages, see APPENDIX B.

     Some Bulletin Boards allow only six characters for a file name.
If you have downloaded as BAB94A.TXT, please rename to BABEL94A.TXT
before using.

     And please remember to ECAL.
