Possible translation:   615 cyl, 6 heads, 17 sectors = 32,117,760

Note: A "custom" or "user-definded" CMOS drivetype  may ask for a
numerical value for the Write Precompensation cylinder and for the
Landing Zone cylinder.  A basic rule-of-thumb for drive models that do
not require the old Write Precomp technique or a Landing Zone because
they are Auto-Parking is to add 1 to the cylinder value being used. As
an example: If cylinders equaled 820, then both Write Precomp and
Landing Zone would be entered as 821. Some BIOS will convert this to
65535 or -1, which are functionally equivalent to "none (not used)".

PHYSICAL/LOGICAL equivalent to NATIVE/TRANSLATION

WARNING - Already low-level formatted at the factory.

Since a User-definable or Custom translation geometry may be used, it
is imperative that the values be written down and kept with your
permanent records for retrieval in the event of CMOS battery failure.
