A toll-free computer network?  That's right!  We've put together a
unique system that will provide toll-free echomail access to present and
future members of ITCnet, the International Telecommunications Network.
ITCnet is similar to other echomail networks, such as Fidonet, to name 
one, and will become the first and only completely free-access, toll-free, 
computer network open to SysOps and computer users from around the globe.

When enough support and backing is established, members who would
normally have to call long distance for their echomail feeds will most
likely be able to call a local hub, or perhaps use one of several toll-
free numbers instead.  

How are we going to pay for this?  Absolutely NOT by asking for your 
financial support.  MCI long-distance carrier, by indirect involvement, 
will make our toll-free network a reality.  Not because they're the best 
long distance carrier, nor is it because we like the resonant sound of 
their acronym.  In fact, if you talk to an MCI representative and ask him 
or her about ITCnet, or a toll-free computer network they're "involved in",
they will undoubtedly develop a blank, confused expression.  Why?  Because 
they're not directly involved at all.

So why MCI?  Because they're the only long distance carrier which uses
individual "distributors" in a manner which furthers our specific aim.
As you might expect, any distributor of their long distance service
benefits each time an individual switches to MCI, and continues to
benefit as long as that person is a continuing MCI customer; that is 
MCI's way of rewarding the distributor.  As a means of achieving a 
toll-free network, recently ITCnet Administration has, in effect, become 
a collective MCI distributorship; financial benefits accruing from all 
MCI subscribers who switched their long distance service under this plan 
will directly fund the 1-800 echomail services for ITCnet.

It's a win/win situation -- everyone involved benefits under this plan.
All that's necessary is that the system be self-sufficient.  Otherwise,
the network cannot afford to provide the service.  That's why we need
large-scale participation.

In the initial stages, NOT every node will have a 1-800 number to call
for echomail.  However, if our current progress continues unabated,
toll-free accessibility will continue to be gradually incorporated into
the network structure (regions, hosts, hubs, nodes, etc.) in a matter of
months or even weeks, depending on the response.  Yes, our ultimate goal
is to make ITCnet absolutely TOLL-FREE!

If you'd like to help pioneer and participate in our toll-free network, 
all you need to do is send me your mailing address so I may send you a 
special MCI application form.  You can help out even more by telling 
others what we're doing and whom to contact -- even if they're not yet in 
ITCnet.  The more who get involved means the sooner we'll all have a 
toll-free network!

I've attached an ITCnet Introductory Packet in case you're not already 
an ITCnet member and would like to join; please share it with anyone else 
who's interested in ITCnet.  Further information and instructions are 
included in the file.
