Speaking of passwords, I think it's probably a good idea that someone
should advise our new (and not so new) users on the art of picking
passwords. Anybody volunteer? Speak now or forever hold your peace? No?
Ok, I'll take it on myself to do this.
 
Your password is the only thing that stands between you and some nasty
haker-type person. Your username is common knowledge to everybody that
uses the system, so you must keep your password secret. This means not
telling people, or lending it to people, or writing it down and sticking
it to your screen, or anything like that.
 
It also means that you must choose your password carefully. Recent
experiements have shown that 25% of people choose passwords that can
easily be hacked. The method that is most often used to hack a password is
called the 'dictionary hack'. The hacker gets a dictionary and goes
through it trying each word as the password. Of course he doesn't do this
by hand, he writes a little prog to do it, and the dictionary is a file of
words. So, if you use a word that is found in the dictionary, you'll be
found out. Just stop for a second and think if any of your passwords are
words that are found in the dictionary?
 
So, how do you combat this? Simple, don't choose words from the
dictionary!  But at the same time it's not a good idea to use dates,
number plates, phone numbers, etc. The best ways are to make us words.
Simply string two or more words together to form a new word. For example,
BLADE and RUNNER may be in the dictionary, but I'll bet that BLADERUNNER
or BLADE-RUNNER or BLADE.RUNNER isn't!  You can also use the initial
letters from words of a phrase. For example, Three Blind Mice Ran Up The
Clock would translate to a password of TBMRUTC. Looks like a nonsense
word, doesn't it? But it means something to you, you just have to remember
the phrase.
 
Also, remember not to use the same password on different systems. I know
that this is a hard thing not to do, but try to have different passwords
on each board you use. And change the passwords regularly. Where I work
all the passwords expire after 30 days, and you're forced to enter a new
one. Some systems, like IBM systems, remember the last 5 or so passwords
that you've used, and won't let you re-use them. They also force you to
have at least one digit in the password and other things as well.
 
Oh, and one last thing. There are a whole lot of commonly used passwords.
These passwords are used so often by people, that the hacker will always
try these first.
 
Heres a list that I grabbed of Usenet that someone posted of the most
commonly used passwords:

     The Internet Worm used a lot of the above passwords in it's first
password pass.  After that it just used the dictionary, etc.
 
     It'd really be worth it to check this list when people change
passwords.  That plus 1-2 month password expire is good security.
 
     It's amazing how many people use SECRET or MODEM for their
password.  Not to mention using their first name..

I person would be crazy to admit there password is on that list,
because you will be able to crack that persons account in less then two
minutes using telnet.
 
Note that list is used my everyone, it is effective on non-educated
users but since every password checker written in the last five years
has this list (or the list the internet worm was built from) it is not
as useful as it once was for password cracking. I suggest aquiring a
list of female names, I have had the most sucess with those lists.
 
My 8mm tape collection used a list of common last names, female names,
male names, the worm list, /usr/dict/words (from SunOS 4.1) and the
word list from Webster's 7th Collegiate Dictionary, plus a list I put
together (contains default password some OS's come with).
