You can easily defeat any monster in a fight for an egg, hold your ground and
punch forward, jumping around and breathing fire is not the way to go.  After
three or four falls, your foe will stay down.

Keep eating even if no increase is shown on screen, your health will
skyrocket.

Try typing in ZBACKDOOR on the high score table to call up the back door and
recieve unlimited lives and energy.

following keys at the same time:

           Level One - ALT 1 B

Airball
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can locate the spellbook in the room that also contains the candle.  You
must pick up and remove the blocks to get to it.  With spellbook in hand,
back to the starting screen you go and drop it into the top left corner.  Then
follow the instructions you are given to find the ingredients needed to finish
the game.



All Games
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This cheat is not for a game called 'All Games', but rather a cheat that will
work on all games.  Attach a genlock and everything runs 25% slower, giving
you a chance to get a feel for those really blazing games that normaly kick
your ass without the trainer.  If that's not an economical way to cheat
though, and you are running NTSC and have the necessary setup, boot the game
in PAL to slow it down.  PAL users who just can't seem to find a game that
is fast enough for them, take heart, a solution is at hand.  Switch your
machine to NTSC and see a dramatic improvement in game speed (18%).

Antep
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to the nearest town and offer your items for sale. When ased which item
you should attempt to sale, press the keys 1-5.  These items are, of course,
non-existant, but the shopkeeper must be blind or totally mad, as he will
cheerily offer you exorbatant amounts of gold for absolutely nothing.  The
best thing is, you can repeat this as often as you like and repeatedly sell
the same non-existant item to the same fool many times.  Their is but one
problem with this trick, if you hit numbers higher than 5 this will most
certainly crash the game.



Archipelagos
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hate this game.  So finish the first two Archipelagos then smash the RETURN
key to select another.  Type in the magic number 8421 and bang the RETURN
key a few more times.  Now you can go wherever you want.  A much easier
solution is to turn off the computer for at least 30 seconds and boot
something else.



Arkanoid
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pressing the SPACE BAR will pause the game and allow you to type DSIMAGIC, but
then you must unpause so you will have all the keys and associated cheats
listed below at your disposal:

       B - Break      Opens gates so you can leave, plus bonus points
       C - Catch      Lets you catch the ball
       D - Disrupt    Splits into 3 seperate balls
       E - Expand     Gives you much larger VAUS
       F - Finale     Skip to last level and fight DOH
       L - Laser      Lets you shoot bricks
       P - Play Bonus Extra man
       S - Slow       Makes the ball really slow and easy to hit

Feel free to use each cheat as often as you like, and activate as many modes
as you like at once.  Now press ENTER to skip levels.

As the pink loading screen comes into view, hold down the CAPS LOCK and type
IMAGINE.  As the opening bit begins to play, type away PETEJOHNSONWANTSCHEAT.
Now you may press S and both exits will open allowing you to exit the level
without doing much but typing in the cheat right and making up your mind to
go left or right.  How fun.  A better cheat would be to type in DALEY88 at
the same pink screen and restart at the same level you last died on.  That's
more like it.

To become indestructable, gain infinite money and fuel, complete the first
attack level.  When the shields/weapons screen appears, move the cursor to the
top left corner of the screen.  This will place it in the shields box.  Now
press the joystick button while hitting the + key on the keypad.  The screen
will flash, indicating that the cheat mode has been activated.  If the screen
does not flash,  keep pressing fire and hitting the + key simulataneously. It
will work eventually.  Now transfer all the energy to the weapons.  Shields
can still be drained by hits and colliding with objects, but once it reaches
000, the ship can not be destroyed.

To win at the game, simply choose the last planet as the destination.  Once
you enter the spaceport, there will be a short animation showing your ship
leaving the galaxy.

Hold down the + key on the keypad and press fire.  Then during play the F1
key disables enemies, F6 replenishes energy and 1-10 keys give you different
weapons.

Bane of the Cosmic Forge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The password to enter the door in the SE tower of the 1st level is SNOOPCHERI.
Use the ROTTEN CHEESE on the MOUSEHOLE.

Some small help for playing the game successfully:

When you create your characters, it may be a good idea just to make all of
them Dracons.  This is untested, but unless you have at least one of this
fire breathing race you surely wont survive the game.  So maybe it would be
good to have more.  Use a good mix of the classes, try to take one of each
spell class and a good solid thief that is at full strength.  Get a good
enough thief and you dont need a fighter.

It may be slow, but keep rolling till you get the best character possible.
Be sure to make at least one character female, there are places in the game
where this is a must.  Dont do it and be sorry later!

Diversify your skills.  Have each character specialise in a few skills
relative to his class.  Do not worry about developing weapons skills, you
have no use for them if you created your party correctly.

In fights early in the game use Dracons breath attack, just be careful not
to overextend yourself.  Rest after each encounter, backing up your hard
work.  Allways search the area after a combat.

Search each square you step in.  Not only this, but search facing all four
directions, many things can only be found that way.

Thieves are not always true.  If you find a lock and have your thief open it,
allways guess it is POISON unless you are 100% sure (i.e. tried it before)
because it is better to suffer something else than to die by getting this
wrong.

Dont bash doors early in the game!  If your characters are not very strong
you will be sorry.  Jammed doors do you no good, as you might never be able
to open them again.  Same goes for picking the lock.  Wait till you get a
caster capable of conjuring KNOCK KNOCK with at least 18 points (prefereably
24) and do it this way.  It is much more sure.

Once you know there are secret panels or buttons,  keep walking past them
until you discover them.  You can find them by looking at the maps and know
where they are, sometimes it takes awhile to sense them.



Barbarian (Palace)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the final level when you confront Drax, walk forward and when the first
fireball comes, jump, then do a forward roll into Drax.  If you can't even
get that far then the best way to defeat an oppoent is to roll into him until
he reaches the side, then kick him, roll in to him again and kick him, keep
repeating this method and you'll soon finish the game.



Barbarian (Psygnosis)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 04-08-59 for near invulnerability.

To kill the final Wizard, you must have a shield. When his shot comes at you,
use the defense icon, and it will fly back at him.



Barbarian II (Palace)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Level 1:  left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the
     cave, and right.  Level 2:  right, up, left, up, left, left, right,
     left three times, up, and left.  Level 3:  up, right, right, up, left,
     right, up, right, left, left, up, left, left, up, up, right, right,
     left, left, up.  Level 4: hit the fireballs, then try to leap across.
     Several low chops will destroy it.  Next is the Pit Demon; when he
     reaches out, use an overhead chop to hit his arms; repeat until death.
     Next, Drax himself!  Wait until he pauses between spells, and hit him
     with a flying head chop!  The End...



Bards Tale I - Tales of the Unknown
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get more gold than you will ever need (and then some), transfer all the
parties gold to one player.  Save him to disk then load him back up and
transfer all to another.  Keep repeating this process till you have done it
to all the players, then exit without saving.  Load back up and all your
players will have the amount of gold equal to that of the entire party before.
Reapeat until satisfied.

If your tired of waiting for morning to come enter and exit the guild.

Bio-Challenge
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In game pressing  ESC  to pause the game and pressing G will transport you to
the end of level guardian.

Hints for the first three levels:

        LEVEL 1: Get the green armous as soon as possible. If you have all
     of the amulet, don't go to the sphere unless you have collected at
     least four lots of monster remains, you'll need them to battle the end
     of level guardian. He's a bit soft in the head, so time your jumps
     carefully, and hit him there.

        LEVEL 2: There are four planets to visit, go to everyone if you
     want to get maximum points. Again, the green armour is very useful, so
     get it as quickly as possible. There's loads of ammo for the guardian
     of this level, unfortunetly that means there's loads of monsters to
     deal with. The back of the guardians head is the weak spot.

        LEVEL 3: Stand on the slabs and summersault. There are six planets
     here, and the transporters are more difficult to so, so you have to
     watch more carefully.



Bionic Commando
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exit from level 1 exactly when the timer reads 1 for nine lives and a super

Blood Money

Press HELP and then 1 or 2 and you will restock your supply of lives or money,
respectively.



Bombuzul
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually there is a hidden pause control in the game.  When you press the
spacebar to access the overhead map screen, if you keep it held down the clock
stops until you release it.

When reaching a new level, it's worthwhile to sacrifice a life to see the
explosion pattern.  When trying to detonate a pulsing bomb, pick it up; it's
easier to see its size.  You are invulnerable to explosions when teleporting,
so use it to your advantage!  A blind droid can't activate switches.  Also,
here's a list of the level access codes:

land, make sure you put something back in or he will attack on his next turn.

Giganoid
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press the CAPSLOCK key on the player select screen and a message will appear.
Start the game and you have more lives.



Globulus
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most important thing to remember is that ALL the puzzles can be solved
without losing a life, so if you lose a life and think its the only way to
solve the screen, look closely.  Some of the puzzles get pretty obscure after
level 10, but once you eventually beat them you'll kick yourself for not
seeing the solution earlier.

Look before you leap.  Think about how the screen will look from a flipped
perspective.  A lot of jumps you make will be unnecessary and waste time and
switches if you don't.

Make sure you have enough switches, at least 10 per screen.  It is possible
to get stuck on a downward slope with no way to get back up or kill yourself,
and the only way out is to press ESC and start the whole game over.

Here are a few codes you might like to try:

     Level 06 - IVEs8AZ?
     Level 11 - dynle1cJ

Type Zvmo!EG as a password for the cheat mode.

Level Passwords: Level 2 - JZS
                 Level 3 - SFJ
                 Level 4 - USX

On level two, buy a shield and a magic potion, then get three fireballs and
three stars.  Spend all of your remaining money on food and health.  Collect
all the gems in the usual manner, then get a key and make for the exit.  Now
comes the tricky bit...

When you descend the last ladder, two thieves will appear.  Make sure that
you don't quite have enough energy to survive a direct contact!  Before
going down the ladder, release your magic potion, then climb down and open
the door.  Stand in front of the door ready to leave, but don't push up yet!
Wait until the thieves jump down at you and as soon as they touch you push
the joystick up.  You may loose that life, but then something rather strange
will happen.  The bonus will start to whiz up for quite some time, until
the game starts again on world two with 28 extra men and about five million
points!

retype above.  This will make you invincible. F6 will take you back to the
shop and F8 will give you lots of money.

     When the game asks for a mission code, enter `1 KILLING'.

To call up a map of level one, section one, boot up the game as normal and

Kings Quest III
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When casting a spell and asked to recite a verse just hit RETURN.

The King's Quest series of games uses the debug command and interpreter for
the programmers (up to KQIII) KQIV doesn't have it because of the tremendous
size of the game.  Have some fun and press the "ALT" key then "D" then
"Return or Enter" (I think twice) then type in either GET OBJECT (and type in
a random #) or "TP" for transport (and a random #) and see what happens.  It
works., and if you're tired looking for a certain object the "Get Object"
function works great!



Klax
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Begin play and hold down either SHIFT key and SPACE together.  Now press any
key from 1 to 4 for differnt helpful effects.

While playing the game, press SPACE and 4 to warp to LA stage.



Kristal
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fights - Proficent swordplay is  essential if your to  get anywhere in
     the game.  The neck chop is one  of the more effective blows,  but the
     program blocks repetition of single moves. To get around this, occass-
     ionaly switch to a differnt move in order to enable the neck chop once
     again. Give generously  to the poor and youll  be a step closer to ob-
     taining the Sword of the Spheres.

     The Palace - To enter  the palace,  youll need  to get  the invitation
     from the elusive Gloop, found in Novala. Once you have it, keep out of
     fights or you  could lose  it for good.  When you get into the palace,
     ask Nedrod  three questions  and he will give you the talisman,  which
     can help you find another useful item.  Answer the Princess's question
     with "Its a secret".  She will give you the  Ring of Belz,  which will
     only work in conjunction with the spell scroll.

     In General - Objects are not always found in the same places from game
     to game, so a detailed search of both fore and backgrounds is often in
     order.  To survive the final  confrontation,  a high psychic rating is
     needed, which can be increased by donating skringles to the poor. Dis-
     orderly conduct can have the opposite effect.  The safest technique in
     the space battles, is to slow right down as soon as you see the aliens
     shoot them all,  then power at full  steam until the next lot.  Follow
     Readheads ship  if you see it.  Heatpro  tablets are  necessary if you
     beam down to one  of the hotter planets.  Makes notes of  what you are
     told, and use any new  names or subjects to  weavel out every last bit
     of information from the characters.

Laser Squad
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In LASER SQUAD, for fun do The Assassins on Level 1.  Buy no armour, give the
corporal an M4000 with two reloads, the next two rocket launchers with four
rockets each, and the last two nothing at all.  Deploy in the entrance, in the
gap in the outer wall , and take the house to pieces with the rockets, waiting
for droids or Regix to show up - get them with Jonlan's M4000.  I managed to
do the scenario with one shot - it went BETWEEN the leaves of the door, blew
up against a wall and Regix was on the other side.  End of story, fade to
black.

Hardball

Various hints:
 
     * Allstars are better than champs, 
     * Only steal if you actually hit the ball, 
     * Try to get a lot of runs early, as the computer team improves
       towards the end, 
     * Bunting rarely works, 
     * Halfway through the match, swap Laws for Wells and Wratten for
       Harris. 
More[n,Y,=]                * The best pitchers are Oliver, Perez, Leary, Cook.  The others
       will only be successful for a short while, 
     * Never pitch fastballs to the center as they will usually result
       in home runs, 
     * Change pitchers after a few innings, because as they get tired,
       their accuracy and speed get worse.



Hawkeye

Pause the game and press the DEL key, after doing so, when you die, you will

lose all their lives and then player 2 will return with 99 lives, as soon as
he dies once, player 1 will come back with 99 lives.  Just incase that's too
difficult for you, here are some codes to the levels, maybe you can get
someone to type them for you, and play the game...

     Level 11 - SPIN
     Level 21 - FLIP

Heros of the Lance
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some general tips:  

     Arrange your party so that the  first line consists of two strong warr-
     iors, Raistlin and Goldmoon.  This allows you to use Raistlin's magic &
     the healing staff of Goldmoon without too much hassle.  Save Tanis and
     Riverwind for the later levels, where the bows come in handy.  When
     fighting Gully Dwarves, use Tasslehoff who is the same height as them.
     His sling stones will never miss.  Avoid fighting Hatchlings, they're
     not worth it.  Just turn and run when you meet one; when you reach an
     intersection move into a new path and wait a little.  When you return,
     the Hatchling will have gone.  Killing Bozaks: two methods:  1) get
     Raistlin to  use a web, sleep or charm spell to stun it, then send a
     warrior to clobber it to death, or 2) select Flint, who is a dwarf; 9
     out of 10 times, the Bozak's shots will go over his head get close to
     enter melee combat, and use low thrusts to kill it.  Spectral Minions:
     they're easy to kill, so use a warrior.  Wraiths: a well-timed throw of
     an axe kills them every time.  If you miss, use a sword and chest-thrust
     movements.  Don't let it get too close to you!  Spiders: use low thrusts
     to keep them at bay.  If they get through your guard, retreat until you
     can turn and fight again.  The blue and green potions restore health,
     red slows down monsters, and yellow give your characters extra confid-
     ence.



Hillsfar
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you are attempting to pick locks, make life a whole lot easier by
pressing the F key (that key located between the D and G on the keyboard).



Horror Zombies from the Crypt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To attain infinite lives just hold down the M key.  If that's not enough,
type CHEATMODE then you be able to use the F10 key to skip levels.

Or maybe some codes would help:

          Level 1 - Just hit return     Level 4 - LUGOSI
          Level 2 - WOLFMAN             Level 5 - NOSFERATU
          Level 3 - HAMMER              Level 6 - GARLIC

How about typing BOGEYMAN for infinite lives?

Enough already!



Hunt for Red October, The
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When surronded by enemy ships, it's quite likely they plan to blow all hell
out of you.  Don't let them, cheat!  Save the game.  Restore the game, where
the hells have all those subs gone? hehe



Hybris
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Load the game as usual and don't do anything until the high score
     screen appears.  Type 'COMMANDER' and then press the fire button.
     After a few moments press F10.  If your ship flickers you are now
     invulnerable, and have infinite expansions and smart bombs.

     F1-F5 = Other Six Levels of 'expansion' (you can still capture the
             capsules)
     F8    = Advance a level (There are three)
     F10   = Turn cheat mode on/off

     You cannot get a high score with the cheat mode on.
     At the title screen type SPACE or ESC key (I forgot exactly which
     one) Now you'll get a screen in which you can edit a lot of game
     parameters.

Before attempting to go into the ants' nest, you should first save Elmer to
get more flamethrower fuel.  Some time between the 8th and 10th (I don't
remember the exact day), he will leave a note in his station saying that he is
going hiking in the SW Volcanic Cone.  Go to the volcano, fight the ants, and
next day, visit Elmer's station.  He'll thank you for saving his life and give
you more flamethrower fuel.

The entrance to the ants' nest will never appear on the main map, but there
are several other ways to get there:

        - By taking a flight from Hilber's Field.

        - By driving a tank from a battle going on at a nearby location.

        - By going south when you are in a battle at the M1 mine.

The entrance to the nest doesn't stay open long enough for you to get in
before the ants start invading the various locations in the town so you'll
have to wait until they do.  The 11th is the best day to enter the hole since
it is very hot and there are few ants around.  If you try cooler days, there
will probably be too many of them around for you to handle.  Also, if you
decide to get to the hole by plane, you can land safely on the dirt road
parallel to the tracks leading to the M1 mine.

A quick tip to gain cash.  Find a High Tech world with a low law level and buy
as many PGMP's as possible, although this may only be one initially.  Then go
to a lower Tech, higher law level world and sell the merchandise.  The ideal
pleanets are: LLUN/EFATE (when using the trader character on the disk you can
purchase a PGMP for 130500 credits) and STUR/EFATE (where not only is there
a PGMP lying on the floor nesar the Gun shop, but they can be sold for 244500
credits).  In no time at all and with a little cost (because you are staying
within the system) you will gain riches untold!

The code for a large supply of shields is XR31TURBONUTTERBASTARD.  This code
should probably typed while playing, but you can type it anywhere, not that
it is likely to work.  In fact, it is very unlikely it will work at all for

The code for level skipping is XR31 TURBO NUTTER BASTARD then press any key
from 1-6 to skip to the corresponding level. Alos you may press RETURN to
call upon extra weapons.

786169 takes you to part two of the game.

PART 1:
        Move back slightly when you encounter a mine.  They're much less
        sensitive from the rear.

        Avoid jetski bullets by jumping or ducking.

        When approaching sharks, move the up and down nut left and right.

        Octopi and sea monsters are easily thwarted by holding down
        fire until both missiles are ignited and then releasing.

        Struggle to dock with a submarine?  Put a mini-sub in the gap between
        the tailfin and the hull, face the left of the screen and move
        upwards slowly, the computer takes over the docking procedure for you.

PART 2:
        The code is 948411.

        Arrows indicate the direction of the lifts.

        Kill white marines and flamethrower troops to get more ammo.
        Stand over the body and search thoroughly.

        To get the code of an official, you must shoot him with a gun,
        not a flamethrower.

        To enter computer codes, stand by a terminal, push up and
        you'll be asked for a code.  Two of the codes are:

        Transmit message: 1st or 2nd transmission official
        Open door: 1st or 2nd machine official

        To open the reactor door, use the terminal next to the reactor.  The
        computer confirms the bomb is planted.  Go out, use the game terminal
        you used to open the door and transmit the following: OABERYAMD.  Now
        type END at the ready prompt and run like hell to the conning tower.

 

Navy Seals
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play until you get a high enough score to get your name onto the high-score
table, then enter your name as PSBOYS.  Start the game again and press H to
pause.  Now you can press ESCAPE to skip to the next level.  Any time you
want to jump onto the next stage, simply press H then ESCAPE.  Still, if you
can't do the first stages, then skipping to the later ones may be even more
embarrassing, so be warned!

New Zealand Story
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pause, press M.  After you hear the laser type MOTHERFUCKENKIWIBASTARD for
unlimited lifes.  Or FLUFFY KIWIS does the same thing.

On level 2.4 stand at the entrance to the octopus room and fire to the right a
few times.  A warp will take you to level 3.1.

To access the cheat mode just press "TRY CHEATING" (including the space) keys
together while on the title screen.  The border should turn grey and when you
start the game you have infinite kiwi's and the ability to skip levels by
pressing "<-".

Anyone heard of the whirl-winds?  They advance you levels.  Near the end of
level 1.1 there are three large steps that you must climb to reach your
brother (sister?), who is in a cage.  Stand at the left edge of the top step,
facing left and jump.  But as you jump, fire.  If your current weapon is
arrows, fire halfway up, but if your weapon is bombs, fire at the top of your
jump.  A whirl-wind should appear after four hits, and it will take you to
level 1.4.

In 1.4, you will be in a little box under some water.  Go up and to the right,
and you come out in a small room with three boxes on the right hand side.  Go
up these, and you will see 4 long spaces, the top one having an "N" and a "D"
in it.  Go up to the top one, get the letters, stand in the centre of the
space, facing left, and fire.  Yep, you guessed it, another whirl-wind.  This
one takes you to level 2.4.

Or on level 2.4 , stand at the entrance to the room where the giant octopus
is located and fire to the right several times. A warp will appear that will
take you to the beginning of level 3.1.

On level 1, part 1, move to the area containing three men with boomerangs,
shoot them.  Go to the top of the third platform, move to the left, jump and
fire five times.  A whirlwind in a box will appear, if you enter it, you will
be transported to the end of the level.  Then you can free Tiki's naughty
friend just by jumping.

When you recch the ice whale, move to the right-hand side of the spikes, avoid
the crystals, and wait until he picks you up.  Once inside the whale, you can
start shooting, but avoid the ice drops.

Meeting the rock monster without bombs makes him difficult to pass.  So
collect bombs, go to the highest platform and shoot him.  Kill it by either
dodging the bullets and hitting it when the doors open, or by fireballs.

The last boss you encounter is the balloon seal.  He cant be killed, by blows
to the body, so you must hit the balloon.  Be careful for the balloon seal is
armed with a cannon and shoots cannon balls at Tiki.

The town names are:

        AUCKLAND, ROTORUA, WAITOMO CAVES, STRAIT COOK, and MT COOK.



Neuromancer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you first begin, sell all your body parts.  You can get along just fine
without them for now, and it gives you enough to get a half way decent deck.
You will eventually need to buy them back before you start entering

Operation Wolf
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
More[n,Y,=]           At the end of a level, between the time when you kill the last bastard and
the time appears, rolling the mouse down causes damage to decrease.

For the most accurate shot possible, pause the game with F1, position your
crosshairs over the selected enemy, unpause the game, click the button and
blast him to hell.



Operation Thunderbolt
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should get a score of at least 50,000 (good luck!) and on the high scores
table enter your name as WIGAN NINJA.  Now hit F7 to skip about the levels.

But level skipping probably won't help without infinite lives, so type your
name as EDOM TAEHC instead and that's what you have.

If the game isn't quite tough enough, perhaps typing SPECCY MODE into the
high score table will provide more challenge, doubling the amount of
enemies.

On the title screen you should press F8 and hit the fire button at the same
time for laser sights, but on 2 player games hit F2 instead instead of F8.



Overlander
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just a few tips - When cruising the highway don't stop shooting, and always
choose the highest paid mission.  Buy fuel carefully - only enough for that
level, after level 1 you MUST buy a leanburner.  Try to stay in the middle of
the road and travel fast, travelling slowly only burns more fuel.  Fire bombs
are more useful than smart bombs when you learn how to use them.
Bulletproofing is necessary after level 2.  When travelling through the
barriers the best speed is 90-120mph.



Outrun
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type RED BARCHETTA to activate the cheat mode then:

  T - 10 extra seconds
  S - Skip Level
  B - Restart same level

Type ZEBEDEE on the high score page then press F1 to skip levels and F2 for
more and more lives.



Pacland
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the title screen appears, type AVALON.  It should flash indicating
you now have unlimited lives!  If that doesn't work, try the following:

Start a 2 player game.  Make it as far as you can with player 1.
With player 2, you must be able to make it as far as the fairy to collect
your boots.  Now that you have gotten your boots, you are going backwards to
where you started.  Push the THIRD cactus on the way back, and a yellow
pacman will appear.  Get it, now kill player 2.  Continue playing with
player 1.  Every time player 1 dies, get the yellow pacman with player 2 and
kill player 2 immediately.  As long as you keep getting the yellow pacman
with player 2, player 1 will never die.

Hints:

Level 1 - Run to the third fire hydrant, and when you get there, jump over
          it and push it to the left.  This will give you a blue hat that
          will make you invulnerable to the little ghosts that fall from
          planes.

Level 2 - Run to the third cactus, and push it to the left.  You will now be
          invulnerable for the entire level!

Level 3 - After getting your magic boots, push the third cactus on the way
          back for a free life.

- Jump on the roof of ghost's car to escape
- Only use powerpills when ghosts are in range, or else it is wasted
- When you reach the breaktime sign, jump when you are about 1 inch away
  for a bonus (depending how high you are when the level ends)

Powermonger
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These aren't really cheats, but some things the manual was rather unclear
about or didn't mention at all.  First of all, when inventing, it is often
helpful to zoom in all the way on the towns (or anywhere for that matter).
It makes things go faster, and your inventions will be done sooner.  Also, in
order to get a captain on your side, find a town with a captain in it.  He'll
be the guy in the cape, usually standing in the middle of town.  Next, set
your aggression level to Passive.  Then go and attack the town.  Make sure you
can beat them first!  If you attack on Passive, your men don't kill anyone,
but rather forcibly coerce them into joining your side.  If you win, you will
get everyone in the town on your side, including the captain.

Later on the first level, look out for a ladder near some water which leads
up to a platform containing an egg.  Climb the ladder and take the egg, then
go to the left into the water to find the submarine room.

There is also a way to find some hidden extra food.  Go to the third screen

Quadralien
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Access codes: level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3- 610169.

And now, some tips: once in the core, you can't quit.  So choose droids with
good lasers, Jack and Spud for example.  The Quadralien mother is made up of
4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes.  The
mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different
direction.  From the starting point there are three exits: north, east, and
west.  Go east and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and
go north to destroy the second box.  You will now have both droids to blow
the remaining boxes.  Go west through the one-way force field, and get the
other.  Don't forget to keep recharging.

Rainbow Islands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We all know that collecting the seven different-colored gems gives you an
extra life and a 100,000 Bonus Gem once the Boss is defeated. But collecting
all of the gems in the correct order of color (from left to right on the gem
counter) not only awards you the life and Bonus Gem, it also grants you access
to a magical secret room.  When you reach the end of the level, a silver door
appears. `You don't have to fight the Boss. (Hint A)

Even more useful is how to create any color gem.  The screen is split into
several invisible vertical stripes of color.  When a gem falls, its color is
determined by the `color' of the area into which it fell.  Now all you have to
do is guage carefully where the dead enemy will fall to create the gem color
of your choice. (Hint B )

     Type these codes on the title page:

     2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an
        alarm and about 8 soldiers will jump you! 
     3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube. 
     4) Never use a gun without a silencer. 
     5) Turn off the electric door with switch located several
        rooms away. 
     6) The mine detector won't work without the generator. 
     7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery. 
     8) Watch out for IR beams, since they also trigger alarms. 

Here's a list of items you can find:

move up until you hit the Gondola.  When you hit it there is a flash, stop
firing and after a few seconds you'll be inside the Gondola.

Shockwave
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few hints and tips follow on how each of the four zones (armys, factorys,
mines and rigs) effect the game:

MINES - Each time a mine is purchased the income you receive for each time
        pass doubles.
FACTORYS - The more factorys you have the faster more weapons are produced,
           these are essential.
RIGS - These supply you with the fuel for each mission run.  The more rigs
       you have the greater the  amount of fuel you receive for each
       time pass.
ARMYS - For every army unit you own, the enemy slows down, eg. you have one
        army unit, for each four time passes that occur the enemy won't move
        for one time pass.  If more than 50% of the sector is occupied by the
        enemy then you will lose one of your assests for each time pass that
        occurs.  The best solution is when 30% of the sector is occupied go
        an attack the enemy.

            mode...  unfortunately it has been ZZAPPED!".  If this happens
            goto the control selection and type "scrap 28' and start the game.



Sim City
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hold SHIFT, type FUND and get $10,000.

Another tip is to set the citizen's taxes to 0%.  Then just before tax
collection (December or November if playing at fast speed) quickly set the
taxes up to 20%.  Then after you collect taxes, put it back down to 0%.
This way the citizens think they are not paying any taxes.

You can build land on water. Find a straight (horizontal or vertical),
stretch of coastline and string a powerline along it. Next, move one
square over, out into the water and string another powerline parallel to
the first. Repeat as many times as you want. Then just
bulldoze all the excess powerlines and you can build on the new land.

To MAKE land you simply make a 3 lane highway across any water source.
When you make a road by putting 3 sections of road on top of three section

Xybots
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enter ALF for your name at brag screen for infinites.

If you manage to reach level 10, you're better off using your radar to kill
the Xybots.  Just line them up using radar and fire, you don't have to be able
to see them.

Keep as many keys with you as possible because some levels don't have enough
to complete them.

There are short cuts to level seven on levels one and four - you get extra
cash for using them.

If you have the extra energy upgrade try not to let your energy fall below
100m, because you lose the upgrade if it does.

Drums are not just decorations - hide behind them when possible and use your
zapper near to them to find more cannon power.

On level eight, near to the top left hand transporter you can get to two white
coins by blasting away one of the three walls around them.

Don't split up in the two-player game, because it's easier to complete it
together.

The master Xybot lives on level 11, and you'll need to stock up on double
shot and extra shot speed to stand a chance of survival.

Try to get one Xybot to stand behind another - they'll blow each other apart.

Zombi
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have seen Dawn Of The Dead, you already have a good idea on how to
solve most of the puzzles.  But here's some extra tips anyway: 1) To lock up
the mall to keep zombies from getting in, you need to park the trucks over
the entrances.  Get the key from the office on the 2nd floor and go to the
4th floor where the keys to the trucks are kept.  2) To keep the dead zombies
from coming to un-life, lock them up in the freezer in the basement. 3) before
you can go play in the basement, you need a source of light.Get the fuses and
gloves from the 3rd floor and go to it!!
