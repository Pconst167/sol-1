What is TIPS?  TIPS is a collection of ASCII files containing solutions or
               work-arounds to various hardware and software problems.  I have
               spent two years developing TIPS, and they are being expanded
               and updated on a continual basis.

Distribution:  This file may be uploaded to any Bulletin Board System and
               distributed freely.  Although individual TIPS are not to be
               distributed in any way, this file is free to the general
               public.

               Note:  This file does not contain any TIPS.  It simply contains
                      a listing of the TIPS available on The Bertha BBS.  Each
                      TIP is located in a separate file on The Bertha BBS,
                      allowing users to search for keywords and download only
                      the TIPS they need.  These TIPS may NOT be copied or
                      distributed in any form.  They are intended for the sole
                      use of subscribers to The Bertha BBS.  Non-subscribers
                      may purchase individual TIPS files for a modest fee.

                      TIPS are available exclusively from The Bertha BBS!

Disclaimer:    Use the TIPS at your own risk!  I have tried to be accurate in
               my diagnosis of problems and their solutions.  However, it is
               impossible to know everything about your machine.  These tips
               worked on my machines, they may not work on yours due to some
               unforeseen differences.  Neither I, nor The Bertha BBS will be
               held responsible for damages done by anything you do to your
               machine.
