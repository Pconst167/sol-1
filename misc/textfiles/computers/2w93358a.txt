                    Guide to PGP Operations in a Secure Environment

The following document provides a series of notes and examples which are designed
to help the PGP novice user to properly maintain and care for public keys in a
secure environment using the PGP utility software.

Item     Activity              Operative Command     Results/Disposition
  No.  
       1 Install System                              Set DOS PATH command in
                                                     AUTOEXEC.BAT so that DOS can
                                                     always find PGP; Set the DOS


                                                     ENV variable TZ=-3 (EST). Set
                                                     the DOS Env. Variable PGPPATH
                                                     to the drive and sub-directory
                                                     where you have your keyrings.
                                                     This will make PGP available
                                                     all the time.

       2 REBOOT                Ctrl-Alt-Del          Required to make DOS Changes
                                                     (Item 1) work.

       3 Generate Secret Key   PGP -kg               System will create public and
                                                     private keyrings in
                                                     subdirectory specified by
                                                     PGPPATH as specified in (1)

       4 Create Public Key     PGP -kxa <user id>    This command will extract a
                               <keyfile>             "Public Key" from your keyring
                                                     and put it in <keyfile>.
                                                     Specify the <user id> to be
                                                     extracted.  To get ready to
                                                     send out you public key: give
                                                     your own user id. Save
                                                     <keyfile>.

       5 Note: At this point you can send a message to someone and include your
         Public Key.  After you have done that, then THEY will be able to send
         you a PGP crypted message.

       6 Received Message      Ah Ha!                Save this message.  You will
         containing Public                           need to process this using
