Quoted below is an article from the Melbourne AGE newspaper dated

Commodore sell-off is a sad footnote
(GARETH POWELL [author] reports on the demise of one of the innovators of
 the personal computer industry.)


THE LATEST chapter in the Commodore saga comes as no great surprise. Last
week, the company Ferrier Hodgson was appointer administrator of the
Australian company after Commodore directors considered their position
and the company's financial problems.

According to Max Donnellt of Ferrier Hodgson, Commodore was unable to service
a bank bill due to roll over at the end of this week. The company is to be
sold.

Commodore, founded by Mr Jack Trameil in the '50s, was initally invovled
with typewriters. Operations were financed largely from Canada, mainbly by the chairman
C. Morgan Powell.

In 1965, three years after the group's public listing, Mr powell was
criticised by a Canadian royal commission for acts of "rapacious and
unprincipled management". He died before the commission finished it's report.

While Commodore got a clean bill of health from the commission, Mr Trameil
subsequently found it difficult to get finance. To the rescue came Canadian
financier Irving Gould, who bought in heavily.

In the early days, the calculator boom supported Commodore, but in the
downturn of 1975 the company suffered a loss of $US55 million on sales
of $US50 million. It switched to computers and profits soared.

In 1985, Mr Trameil left Commodore amid much bitterness and recrimination.
Since then, the company's fortunes have been, to say the least, erratic,
although in the Amiga it had a personal computer that was several years ahead
of it's time.

Amiga was not originally designed  by Commodore. It came froma California
company of longhairs who wanted to make the ultimate computer.
And that was what they did.

When it was launched, the Amiga had graphics superior to any other
computer on the market, a super-fast Motorolla 68000 and wondrous sound.
It was also the first true multi-tasking personal computer. It is a great
sadness that it has all come to this.
