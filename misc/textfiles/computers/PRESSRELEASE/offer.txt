After PC Magazine's most intensive modem evaluation in years, the Intel
14.4EX tied for "Editors Choice" honors with AT&T.  The AT&T modem is more
than double the price of the Intel 14.4EX, making Intel's modem the clear
winner.  Intel has combined this technology with our award winning
SatisFAXtion modems to bring you a new line of faxmodems.  The best of the
bunch will be offered at special pricing to Sysops.

1) SatisFAXtion Modem/400 - an internal V.32bis, coprocessed
   faxmodem with a V.32bis modem, Smart Line sharing and
   Smart UART.  Supports CAS compatible applications.

2) SatisFAXtion Modem/400e; an external V.32bis faxmodem.
   Supports CAS and Class 1 fax interfaces.

   [For more informaton, download the appropriate online
   literature].

   Common features of the 14.4EX, SatisFAXtion Modem/400 and 400e:
   -V.32bis/V.32 speeds of 14.4K, 12K, 9.6K, 7.2K and 4.8Kbps.
   -V.42bis, V.42 and MNP 5 data compression and error control.
   -Automatic speed optimization.  The modem monitors line
    noise and falls back and/or forward to insure the maximum
    throughput.  These speed changes happen in less than 200ms!
   -Adaptive handshaking.  The 14.4EX samples the phone line
    BEFORE the connection is made to maximize throughput.
   -Quick connection option.  The modem can be configured to
    connect with other Intel modems in as little as six
    seconds (vs the normal 12-16 seconds).  Even if you're
    connecting to a non-Intel modem, the connection time can be
    cut to eight seconds.  (NOTE: noisy phone lines will affect
    the performance of this option).
   -Automatic leased line restoration.  In the event of carrier
    loss on a leased line, the modem can be setup to automatically 
    attempt to re-establish the connection.
   -Small form factor.  Our external high speed modems are
    packaged in the same metal case as our 2400bps modem,
    reducing space requirements.
   -Free communications software from Crosstalk.  Each modem
    comes with a free copy of "Communicator by Crosstalk".
    This is the full $99 retail package which includes 13
    terminal emulators and 8 file transfer protocols - including
    ZMODEM.
   -Status lights display connection speeds between 1200 and
    14,400bps and when error control and data compression
    connections have been made (externals only)
   -Maximum DTE rate = 115.2Kbps
