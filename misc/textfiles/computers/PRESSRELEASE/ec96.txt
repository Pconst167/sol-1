                            9600 PLUS
                         External Modem
                       ===================

================================================================

     The Ven-Tel 9600 Plus External Modem provides secure, high
speed communications over both dial-up and leased lines.
Designed according to the CCITT V.32 specifications, it supports
MNP Levels 2, 3, and 4 and is compliant with the internationsl
error correction standard v.42.  In addition, it provides MNP
Level 5 and V.42bis data compression, for throughput up to 36,000
bps.

================================================================

FULL FEATURED V.32 MODEM

     The 9600 Plus External Modem offers an array of features
providing the flexibility needed for most applications.  It
offers full duplex communication at both high (9600 & 4800 bps)
and low (2400, 1200, 0-300 bps) speeds and operates in both
asynchronous and synchronous modes over two-wire dial-up or
leased lines.  Designed according to the CCITT V.32
specifications for Trellis Coded Modulation, it also supports
V.22bis, V.22, V.23, V.21, Bell 212A, 103 and 202.

ERROR CORRECTION GUARANTEES ACCURATE TRANSMISSION

     The 9600 Plus provides error correction using MNP Levels 2,
3, and 4 and is compliant with the international error correction
standard V.42.  Therefore, worldwide error-free communication is
provided whether transmitting domestically or internationally.

TRANSFER DATA AT SPEEDS UP TO 36,000 BPS

     With MNP Level 5 data compression, the 9600 Plus offers
throughput of up to 19,200 bps.  When used in the Ven-Tel "V.32
Turbo" mode with V.42bis, the modem is capable of data transfer
speeds up to 36,000 bps.  In addition, the DTE may transmit data
to the modem at speeds up to 38,400 bps thereby allowing the user
to take full advantage of the DTE's higher speed for increased
productivity.

COMPATIBLE WITH LOCAL AREA NETWORKS

     The 9600 Plus is fully compatible with Novell, 3Com, Banyan
and other LAN products, providing high speed LAN-to-LAN, PC-to-
LAN, or mainframe/mini-to-LAN communication.

ACCESS SECURITY PROTECTS SYSTEM

     Access Security restricts remote modem users from accessing
the local PC or terminal, thus reducing the possibility of
compromising confidential data or uploading damaging files.
Three user access levels of security are provided - Callback,
Programmed Callback, and PassThrough Access - as well as local
and remote security supervisor access.  Up to 15 remote user
names, passwords, and callback numbers may be stored in the non-
volatile memory of the 9600 Plus.

REMOTELY CONFIGURE THE 9600 PLUS

     Ven-Tel's proprietary Remote Options Access and Downloading
(R.O.A.D.) enables the system manager to access and reconfigure
the 9600 Plus from any location, thereby providing optimum
control of the network.  Through R.O.A.D. access, the system
manager can now isolate configuration problems with a simple
phone call.

AT AND V.25BIS DIALERS ENABLE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATION

     The 9600 Plus supports the popular AT commands used by most
communications software as well as the V.25bis asynchronous and
synchronous dialer.  The V.25bis dialer provides compatibility
with international dialing commands and allows operation with
communication software supporting V.25bis, HDLC, SDLC, and BSC
commands.
