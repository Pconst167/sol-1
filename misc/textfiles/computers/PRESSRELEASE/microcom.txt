MICROCOM DEBUTS INDUSTRY'S FIRST V.32bis PORTABLE MODEM 

MicroPorte 4232bis Supports Data Communication Over Cellular and Land-lines
with MNP 10 Adverse Channel Enhancements

BOSTON, MA (Networld Booth #1508), FEBRUARY 11, 1992 -- Microcom), Inc.,
(Norwood, MA) developer of MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol), today
debuted the MicroPorte 4232bis, the industry's first V.32bis portable
modem. With V.32bis, the MicroPorte 4232bis yields high-speed throughputs
up to 38,400 bps on land-based lines reducing modem connect time,
resulting in substantial line cost savings. In keeping with the Company's
strategy, the MicroPorte 4232bis supports MNP 10 providing enhanced data
transmission reliability over both dial-up and cellular connections.

The MicroPorte 4232bis has a footprint about the size of an index card,
weighs 10 ounces, and supports the advanced modem features users have come
to expect from Microcom's premium desktop modems.

"The MicroPorte 4232bis is the only high-speed portable modem that enables
users to communicate virtually anywhere," says Stephen P. Mank, Microcom's
Vice President of Marketing. "Supporting communication over cellular is
particularly important to the increasing number of laptop, notebook,
palmtop and pen computer users who require mobile communication
capabilities. With MNP 10, their connect times are shorter and
communication links more reliable."

Microcom's MNP 10 gives the MicroPorte 4232bis user a better chance to get
connected and stay connected over poor quality cellular and land-based
links. MNP 10 incorporates four unique functions called Adverse Channel
Enhancements (ACE) that regulate modem speed and packet sizes, optimizing
data transfer under virtually any conditions. MNP 10 initiates a call at
1200 bps, the most robust level, then upshifts to the highest possible
line speed. Throughout the call, MNP 10 monitors various line parameters
and aggressively adapts packet size and shifts modem speed, upward or
downward, providing optimum data throughput.

In addition to supporting CCITT V.32bis modulation standards and MNP 10,
the MicroPorte 4232bis also supports MNP 2-4 error control, MNP 5 and
V.42bis data compression, and other modulation standards, including V.32
(9600), V.22bis (2400), V.22 (1200 bps), Bell 212A (1200 bps) and Bell 103
(300 bps).

The MicroPorte 4232bis includes an AC power pack and rechargeable
batteries. Fully charged batteries provide 1.5 hours of connect time. Auto
shut-off conserves battery life when the MicroPorte is not in use. For
mobile computing, users can purchase an optional 12-volt DC adapter that
plugs into a standard automobile cigarette lighter.

Shipping to authorized Microcom resellers in March 1992, the MicroPorte
4232bis will have a list price of $899.

BOSTON, MA (Networld Booth #1508), February 11, 1992--Microcom, Inc.,
(Norwood, MA) developer of the Microcom Networking Protocol (MNP), the de
facto modem standard, today debuted the QX/4232bis+, the newest member of
its V.32bis modem family. The QX/4232bis+ is ideally suited for users of
high-power PCs and larger systems requiring very high throughput, solid
security and error-free transmission over dial-up or leased lines.

Enabling users to transfer data at speeds up to 57,600 bps, the QX/4232bis+
eliminates performance bottlenecks that frequently occur when running
complex applications with slower modems. The high-speed QX/4232bis+ also
provides the throughput users require for data-intensive applications
running on midrange, mainframe and supercomputers.

In addition to 2-wire dial-up operation, the QX/4232bis+ supports 4-wire
leased lines. This preserves users' modem investments as the QX/4232bis+
is compatible with most 4-wire modems.

If the leased line connection is disrupted, the QX/4232bis+ automatically
switches to a 2-wire dial backup. While in backup mode, the modem
continually monitors the leased line and switches back to 4-wire operation
when the line is restored. Throughout the backup process, the QX/4232bis+
maintains complete data integrity.

Since many large computer systems are installed in banks, financial
institutions and Fortune 1000 corporations, Microcom designed the
QX/4232bis+ with multiple security modes to protect sensitive financial
and technical data. Sophisticated security features enable users to
program a security database for up to 20 users, selecting fixed dial-back,
variable dial-back or pass-through security, depending upon the user's
needs. Other security features are also provided.

For both synchronous and asynchronous operation, the QX/4232bis+ provides
CCITT V.25bis dialing commands. This feature is particularly valuable to
users of IBM AS/400 systems, which commonly support V.25bis dialing.

Following its strategy of providing high-performance capabilities in its
modems, Microcom also includes MNP 10 in the QX/4232bis+. MNP 10 provides
users with an effective solution for communicating data over cellular
networks and other adverse channels such as noisy land lines. MNP 10
enhances modem connectability and adjusts packet size and modem speed to
optimize performance of the QX/4232bis+.

Other features provided in the QX/4232bis+ include

ù Auto Logon
. PCS Security
ù Multiple Configurations
. UUCP/Kermit Spoofing
ù Remote Access
ù Auto Dial-back On Loss of Carrier

Microcom will ship the QX/4232bis+ to authorized dealers by the end of
January 1992. The modem will have a list price of $1099.

Microcom's other V.32bis modems include the QX/4232bis desktop model and
the recently announced MicroPorte 4232bis portable modem. Both include MNP
10 and provide speeds up to 38,400 bps.
