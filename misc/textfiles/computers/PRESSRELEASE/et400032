                               INFORMATION RELEASE

                               TSENG ET400/W32 CHIP

Date: Sep 4, 1992

Tseng Labs Inc. (PA. USA) has started sampling it's ET4000/W32 Multi-
processing, Multi-tasking SVGA chips. At the Microsoft Window Hardware
conference Sept 1 '92, the ET4000/W32 showed a Winmark of 28 million
pixels/sec - over 60% faster than any other DRAM or VRAM Windows
accelerator cards shown at the conference. The figure will be further
improved with newer software drivers.

Windows' performance is not TSENG ET4000/W32's only strength, it offers
other important advantages :

* Compatibility

        The ET4000/W32 is hardware and software compatible with
        approximately 5,000,000 ET4000 installations. This
        compatibility protects users' old investments on software/
        hardware and offers a very powerful growth path.

* 16-bit/32-bit bus with Video Cache

        ET4000 has been widely recognized for its excellent Local Bus
        performance due to its video cache technology. The ET4000/W32
        has a 2nd generation video cache technology which offers better
        performance and an architecture for future products such as the
        ET4000/W64.

* Windows acceleration

        ET4000 is designed for improvement of Windows performance and
        multimedia applications instead of cloning IBM 8514/A or XGA.
        It out-performs and out functions 8514/A and XGA.

* Imaging Port and hardware Window

        The ET4000/W32 offers an Imaging Port to accept imaging data
        and can display the image on a hardware window. Hardware Zoom
        and Video functions will be available on early 1993 with a
        small ASIC chip complimentary to ET4000/W32.

* Simultaneous multi-processing

        The ET4000/W32's Windows accelerator, CRTC and Imaging Port
        can operate simultaneously. Most other Windows accelerators
        can only do one task at the time (Example : When CPU writes
        to display memory, Windows accelerator has to stop or vice
        versa).

        It's multi-processing capability will be able to take
        advantage of multi-thread capability of new operating systems
        such as Windows NT.

* High color and True color

        ET4000/W32 supports 800x600 in 24-bit true color, and 1280x1024
        in 16-bit color.

* Low-cost DRAM

        The ET4000/W32 requires only 80ns ot 70ns DRAM to provide high
        performance and multi-processing capability.


Tseng is now delivering 1st-iteration chips which contains some minor
bugs. "We fully acknowledge and document these bugs. We know the errors
and their solutions. The 2nd iteration will be available to customers
at early Oct. 92 and will correct all those bugs. For such a powerful
and sophisticated chip the achievement of 1st iteration chips of
ET4000/W32 proves Tseng's technological excellence" said Jack Huang,
President of TsengLabs International Co., Ltd. at Taipei.

With about 5 million ET4000 chips installations and the new ET4000/W32
chip, Tseng positions to continue to set standard and paces of PC
graphics display technology.
