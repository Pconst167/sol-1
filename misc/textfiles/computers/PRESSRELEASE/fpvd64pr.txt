ORCHID PREMIERES FAST GRAPHICS
WITH MPEG AND DIGITAL VIDEO SCALING
HyperDriver(TM) Technology Speeds Multimedia Applications

FREMONT, CA--April 3, 1995-- Orchid Technology announced today 
the merging of high-performance graphics and digital video playback 
with its latest market entry, the Fahrenheit ProVideo 64. With HyperDriverTM 
technology and the ability to play and scale both standard and MPEG 
digital video, the Fahrenheit ProVideo 64 begins a new era in graphics 
card performance. 

The Fahrenheit ProVideo 64 combines S3's latest 968 chipset and video 
memory (VRAM) for extremely fast Windows and DOS performance. A complete 
suite of software drivers for CAD, business and graphics is included,
as well as Orchid's new HyperDriver Windows software. Orchid's HyperDriver 
technology is geared towards multimedia and digital video playback 
applications. While providing compatibility with today's high refresh 
rates and resolutions, the HyperDriver technology also handles the 
large block transfers of video data faster than competing offerings. 
Unlike other 64-bit graphics accelerators, the Fahrenheit ProVideo 
64's HyperDriver is compatible with digital video capture cards. 


According to Tony Rodrigues, Director of Product Marketing, "Users 
no longer have to choose between speed, compatibility and feature 
sets. The Fahrenheit ProVideo 64 pumps out the fastest graphics performance 
available while moving computers into full-screen MPEG and digital 
video." 

In addition to hardware video scaling in all modes, the Fahrenheit 
ProVideo 64 supports resolutions up to 1600x1200 and refresh rates 
up to 120Hz. It is available for both PCI and VLB bus architectures,
and comes with either 2MB of VRAM (user upgradeable to 4MB) or with 
4MB of VRAM pre-installed. MSRP is $429 (2MB) and $629 (4MB).

is a worldwide manufacturer of graphics, sound and digital video 
multimedia products for the personal computer market. The company
