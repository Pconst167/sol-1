Q/FAX  a service of Quarterdeck Office Systems

Welcome to Q/FAX!

Q/FAX,  a  service of Quarterdeck Office Systems, allows you  to  receive
technical  notes,  product information and upgrade information  right  on
your fax machine.  Using Q/FAX is easy.  Here's what you do:

1.  Read  through the list below and pick out faxes which are of interest
 to  you.   Then pick up the phone at your fax machine and call (310)314-
 3214.   Q/FAX  is available 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.  This  number
 is  for outgoing Q/FAX service only.  If you want to send us a fax, send
 to (310)314-3217.

2.  When you hear the computer answer, use your touchtone phone to  enter
 the  code number of the fax you want (from the following list), followed
 by  the  pound  sign (#).  You may order up to three faxes per  session.
 To  correct  an error, press the asterisk key (*) and enter  the  number
 again.

3.  When  prompted by the computer, press the "START/COPY"  or  "RECEIVE"
 button  on  your  fax machine.  This is often the green button  on  your
 machine.  You may then hang up and should immediately receive your fax.
