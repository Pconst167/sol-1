Redmond, Washington -- ADIC - Advanced Digital Information Corporation -
intends to ship its 4mm DAT Autochanger for Novell networks on March 1,
1992. A tape storage subsystem that holds up to 96 gigabytes of data based
on the Hewlett-Packard 4mm DCLZ data compression drive, the Autochanger
operates in either random access or sequential stacker mode, utilizing a
standard SCSI interface. Combined with Cheyenne Software's ARCserve 4.0
Autochanger Software Module, the Autochanger provides fully automated,
high-capacity NetWare data storage and management.

Because of the product's flexibility and massive storage capability, the
Autochanger can also be used in mini computer and mainframe applications.
In fact, the Autochanger has already been certified for private label use
by one of the largest mini computer manufacturers in the country.

The Autochanger's proven design is the result of three years of development
and extensive environmental testing to assure data integrity and long-term
reliability. The DAT Autochanger automatically changes cartridges as they
become full and retrieves data on a file-by-file basis. The detachable
tape magazine has a snap-on dust-proof cover for convenient transport and
storage and complete media protection.

List price for the DAT Autochanger is $12,900. Cheyenne Software's ARCserve
4.0 is available for $1195 for a 20-user solution. The Autochanger is
available immediately through ADIC (800-336-1233) and through

Local server backup avoids network traffic and achieves maximum speed by
handling more data in less time. ARCserve 4.0 backs up an entire Local
Area Network (LAN), including local and remote servers, workstations,
program, data and bindery files and all NetWare file attributes and
trustee assignments.

With the combination of ADICs DAT Autochanger and Cheyenne's ARCserve, the
backup process is completely automatic, unattended and reliable.

List price for the DAT Autochanger is $12,900. ARCserve starts at $1,195
