SUNNYVALE, Calif.--January 27,1992--Telebit Corporation (NASDAQ: trading
symbol TBIT), a pioneer of high-speed modems, dial-up networking, and
wide-area communications products, introduced today the ModemMizer,
Telebit's newest member of the ACS (asynchronous communication server)
product family that functions as a non-dedicated communications server
solution for Novell Netware and NetBIOS networks.

ModemMizer is a modem-sharing software solution that operates on any
existing PC workstation and supports up to two modems with port speeds up
to 38,400bps. Providing both dial-in and dial-out functionality, the
ModemMizer utilizes dynamic allocation of ports to effectively manage LAN
modem resources. This insures that no modems or telephone lines are
inaccessible unless they are actually being used. Since the ModemMizer
operates in the background of any PC, local and remote users can access
other applications such as electronic mail and file transfer as well as
dial-out service providers without interrupting the host PCs activity on
the network.

ModemMizer also offers comprehensive network management features including
activity reporting, built-in breakout box, data trace, and remote console
capabilities that are typically offered only in dedicated communications
servers. All of these features can be accessed from any local or remote PC
on the network.

"ModemMizer is the ideal modem-sharing solution for small PC LANs that want
to maximize the performance of high-speed modems and reduce hardware and
phone line costs at the same time," said Michael Ballard, President and
CEO.

The Telebit ModemMizer software package is available immediately for a list
price of $349 and includes a standard 90 day warranty.

Included with ModemMizer is a two concurrent user license for pcANYWARE
IV/LAN version 4.5 software and two copies of pcANYWARE IV/Remote
providing terminal emulation, remote control and support for remote
Windows. Additionally, ModemMizer operates with other third-party
communications packages that support either the Telebit APL Interrupt 14
or NASI workstation interfaces.

Telebit Corporation designs, manufactures and markets advanced highspeed
products for dial-up networking and wide-area communications. The
company's digital signal processing technologies provide extremely
reliable error-free communications across the global switched telephone
network. Telebit markets its products worldwide through distributors,
original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers.
