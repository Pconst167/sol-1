<H1>General Computer Textfiles: Press Releases</H1>
<P>
Press releases have been around a long time, but the advantage of this collection is
that you can now look back across the years and see which promises these companies made,
and which came true. In many cases, the company making claim has disappeared, and their
products are long gone.
<P>
Other companies have risen up past the way they used to be and now offer even more.
These sorts of press releases have really taken hold, although thankfully they don't
tend to clog BBSes anymore.
