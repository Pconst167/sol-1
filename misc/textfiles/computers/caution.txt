          DOS 6 comes with a data compression program called
          DoubleSpace.  It may almost double the size of your hard drive by
          compressing files.  Compression programs use a kind of shorthand
          so that repeated data is stored in less space.  Actually, a
          DoubleSpaced compressed drive is a single file on an
          uncompressed drive.  Such files are called Compressed Volume
          Files (CVF).  DoubleSpace is invisible to your programs.  You
          can use DoubleSpace on both hard disks and floppy disks. 
          HOWEVER, DON'T USE IT WITHOUT READING THE CAUTIONS BELOW.
          
          
                         DOUBLESPACE CAUTIONS:
          
          1.  A DoubleSpaced hard drive is more likely to give trouble
              than an uncompressed drive.  If you have plenty of room on
              your hard drive, don't install DoubleSpace.  You will be
              much better served with a large hard drive that is not
              compressed.  To date, there have been many reports of
              problems with DoubleSpace.  If you need more room, my
              advice is to buy another or a larger hard drive.  
            
          2.  If you plan to use DoubleSpace, you should read the
              README.TXT file in the C:\DOS directory. 
          
          3.  You should not use DoubleSpace if your drive is already
              compressed with another compression program.  You could
              lose all your files! 
          
          4.  If you run DoubleSpace, you will not be able to uninstall
              DOS.
          
          5.  You cannot uncompress a drive that has been DoubleSpaced. 
              Microsoft did not provide an uncompress command.
          
          6.  DoubleSpace can compress a drive to a maximum of 512
              megabytes.
          
          7.  When you run DoubleSpace, DOS creates an extra drive. 
              If you compressed drive C, you would then have a small
              uncompressed drive (perhaps drive H, it depends on your
              hardware).  Be careful not to move or delete any of the
              files in this new uncompressed drive, or it could result in
              the data loss of your entire C drive.  The files on this
              uncompressed drive are: IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS,
              DBLSPACE.BIN, DBLSPACE.INI, and DBLSPACE.000.  These
              files are Hidden and have a Read-Only attribute.  To
              determine where DOS placed this uncompressed drive,
              type DBLSPACE/INFO <ENTER> after you install DoubleSpace.
              If you want to see these hidden files, you can use the
              DIR/A command. Remember, don't fool with these files!
          
          8.  Before you use DoubleSpace to compress a drive, it is a
              good idea to back up your drive.  NOT DOING SO COULD
              RESULT IN A PERMANENT LOSS OF ALL YOUR DATA.
           
          9.  If you plan to install Windows, you should do it before you
              run DoubleSpace.  Windows has a swap file that should be
              stored on an uncompressed drive.  If you install Windows
              first, DOS will automatically take care of this for you.
          
          10. Disable any screen blankers before you run DoubleSpace. 
          
          11. DoubleSpace cannot be run from Windows.  DoubleSpace
              should be run only at the DOS prompt.
          
          12. Use the CHKDSK command to keep an eye on any DoubleSpaced
              drive.  This command will often inform you when (or if)
              there is trouble.
