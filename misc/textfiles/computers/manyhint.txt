                  ATARI ST Guaranteed Cheat Codes and Strategies:
                                 Compiled by KTH

This is a collection of cheats and codes taken from seven seperate text files
from the sewer disk collections.  I have merged them together, removed all
redundancies and trivial hints, removed all AMIGA ONLY hints, and alphabetized
them.  All of these hints have been tested, and have also removed all those
hints where they are either built into our broken versions, or are unnecessary
due to a 'cheat mode' put into the game by the crackers.


***ARKANOID II: REVENGE OF DOH***
When all your lives are lost and the title screen is desplayed, hit the CAPS
LOCK and type MAGENTA. Now when you start a new game, press 's' to open up the
gates either side of the screen so you can progress to the next...But even more
useful is this: loose all your lives and return to the title screen, hit CAPS
LOCK and then type MAGENTA again, only this time type in DALEY88 to take you
right to the last screen.


***BAAL***: the coordinates of all the jetpack platforms, in the order you
should go to them to finish the game. X/Y, X being width and Y being height:
Level 1: 31/16 (cartridge 2), 02/25, 52/30 (cartridge 3), 51/00, 24/38, 62/13,
         02/50, 64/49, 33/58 (exit to level 2).
Level 2: 34/30, 54/12 (cartridge 4), 16/12, 00/24, 03/34, 30/47, 54/12 (exit to
         level 3).
The jetpack isn't used on level 3.


***BARBARIAN II***: step-by-step walk-thru:
Level 1: left, left, right seven times, left, right, left, in the cave, and    
         right. 
Level 2: right, up, left, up, left, left, right, left three times, up, and     
         left.
Level 3: up, right, right, up, left, right, up, right, left, left, up, left,   
         left, up, up, right, right, left, left, up.
Level 4: hit the fireballs, then try to leap across. Several low chops will
destroy it. Next is the Pit Demon; when he reaches out, use an overhead chop to
hit his arms; repeat until death. Next, Drax himself! Wait until he pauses
between spells, and hit him with a flying head chop! The End...

On the next life, shoot the alien and fall into the water on the right just
before reaching the first ramp. On your next life, shoot the green alien, jump
over the ramp and stay in the right-hand lane. If all has gone well, you should
be shot by a bubble like alien, and you should have-finally-activated the
infinite lives mode.  

      
***ENDURO RACER***
When you first begin to play Enduro Racer, after the countdown type the word
CHEAT in on the keyboard. Having typed that in, pressing one of the following
keys will result in a specific effect.

     S - Advances you one checkpoint
     F - Gives you turbo speed (210 kmh)

(holding down the 5 key as you enter the last letter) <May not be necessary>.
HSC gives infinite lives
KDJ gives invulnerability        


***GAUNTLET II***  You need 2 keys and 2 locked treasure chests. As you open
the first chest, hold down the Help key, collect the treasure. Open the second
chest while holding down Insert. An Ankh will appear and you must collect it.
You'll hear a gong. You should now have 50,000 health points and 32,000
reflective super-shots. The shots will vanish once you leave the level, and if
you pick up an amulet, the counter will be reset to 10 shots.

Also, typing FUCK and CUNT results in an interesting message.


***LEATHERNECK***
Start the game and type 'CUTHBERTNECK', then press F3. This will give all
players protection from enemy fire, but not from your team-mates' bullets. To
return to normal press F3 once again.


***KARATE KID 2***: Press P to go to next level 


***MICKEY MOUSE***: After Mickey takes his bow, type 61315688 and a thin white
line will flicker in the border. Hitting F2 opens the door to the sub-game, F3
takes you straight to conflict with a witch, F4 refills your water pistol,
Enter (keypad) quits the sub-game, "." on the keypad completes the sub-game
successfully.


***NEBULUS***: when on the title screen (with the music playing), type
Helloiamjmp. Now, you can access any tower by simply pressing the appropriate
function key. You also get infinite lives.


***OUTRUN***
Type in STARION whilst playing the game then select any of the following codes:
B - Gives extended play
Q - Gives you info about the program
T - Adds ten seconds to your time
S - Takes you through the locations
D - Saves the screen in DEGAS format
x - crashes the computer!


***PLATOON***
Type in 'Hamburger' at the title screen. The word 'Cheat' will appear below the
credits press your joystck button, then (F5) when the jungle screen comes up.
Your man is now invulnerable to the attacks of the little Commie @#!!$&*s. From
here (F1) starts you where you are, (F2) puts you at the location of the
explosives, (F3) takes you to the bridges that you have to blow up, (F4) takes
you straight to the village where the entrance to the tunnels is hidden in one
of the huts. From here on the cheat no longer works, the game runs as normal
and you can die but it certainly gets you further along the track.


***QUADRALIEN***: access codes: level 1- 170961, level 2- 010655, level 3-
610169. And now, some tips: once in the core, you can't quit. So choose droids
with good lasers, Jack and Spud for example. The Quadralien mother is made up
of 4 separate pieces grouped together and surrounded by Earthling boxes. The
mother can only be destroyed by blowing up each box from a different direction.
From the starting point there are three exit: north, east, and west. Go east
and destroy the first box, return to the starting point, and go north to
destroy the second box. You will now have both droids to blow the remaining
boxes. Go west through the one-way force field, and get the other. Don't forget
to keep recharging.


***RAMBO III*** -  get on the high-score list and type RENEGADE. Pressing 1,2
and 3 will drop you on the level of your choice. And now for some tips:

1) When inside the 2nd building, wear your IR goggles.
2) Don't walk in front of soldiers, since it will trigger an alarm and about 8 
   soldiers will jump you!
3) If you enter a dark room, use the glow tube.
4) Never use a gun without a silencer.
5) Turn off the electric door with the switch located several rooms away.
6) The mine detector won't work without the generator.
7) The IR goggles won't work without a battery.
8) Watch out for IR beams, since they also trigger alarms.

Here's a list of items you can find: arrows, silencer, first aid kit, IR
goggles, glow tube, battery, key, mine, detector (in 2 pieces), pistol, ammo,
rubber gloves (you never know when you can be expected to perform major
surgery!!!)


***RAMPAGE***
If you're on the last building and a cloud of dust appears under it punch in
any direction and keep your finger on the fire button until the next screen is
displayed, whereupon you will be ableto climb up an invisible building which is
in the same place as the last building on the previous screen.


***RETURN OF THE JEDI***: enter Darth Vader on the high score list instead of
your name. Pressing F2 will complete a stage and send you to the next one.


***SPACE HARRIER and SPACE HARRIER II***: if you look at disk two, you'll see
some files called LEVEL2.DAT (for example). If you rename THEEND.DAT (or
whatever it's called) to LEVEL1.DAT, you will see the end sequence without
playing the game!


***STARGLIDER***: this one is complex, so pay attention!!
Start the game, slow down completely, press F, and press Backspace. Now, type
in the following twice: JS(Space)ARG(Backspace)S(Backspace)(Return). Pressing N
gives you 5000 points, E reboots the disk, M stops all enemy aircraft, P adds
an extra missile.


***STARGLIDER II***
Select F (for fixed sights) then slow down to a dead stop and pause the game
(using the backspace key).  Type 'Were on a Mission from God' (with the spaces
and case also not important) and press '1' on the keyboard.  If the shield and
energy levels drop to zero the cheat mode has been activated.  Press 'k' to get
all the weapons (including the neutron bomb!), and when you run out just press
'k' again.


***STAR GOOSE***
Hit all the function keys (F1 through F10) and you've got unlimited protection.


***STARRAY***
Unfortunately the cheat mode isn't as straightforward as the game play. Here's
the step by step guide to getting an invincible ship. Make sure your mouse is
plugged in, but don't use it to move the highlight.

1. Access the OPTIONS SCREEN (ie: press the SPACE BAR).
2. Move down to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
3. Push the joystick LEFT and press FIRE. The GAME SCREEN should appear.
4. Centre the joystick and press FIRE again. The OPTIONS SCREEN should
   reappear.  Move down to the SOUND ON option.
5. Push the joystick to the RIGHT and press FIRE. If SOUND ON 
   changes to SOUND OFF, start again from scratch.
6. Return to the VIEW GAME SCREEN option.
7. Push the joystick RIGHT and while holding it in this direction, hold down   
   the RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON.
8. Press the LEFT MOUSE BUTTON.

The OPTIONS SCREEN should change to CHEAT MODE. Return to RESUME GAME and
continue play with a shield that never depletes. If this doesn't work, try
again from a new game.


***SUPER HANG-ON***
On the high-score table enter 207L, which should then be replaced by a row of
dots (indicating that there's cheating afoot). When the next screen appears,
press CTRL, ALT, Z and T to get the cheat mode running, allowing you to change
the strength of the centrifugal force (what a strange cheat!). Zero will allow
you to whip around the course at top speed without crashing at all, while the
higher numbers will more than likely send you off the course at every bend.


***SUPER SPRINT***
On track eight, instead of racing, turn around and position your car just
before the finish line. Point it downwards, and when a drone zooms by,
accelerate and drive it into the wall. It'll crash but it wont be replaced
Repeat the process for the other two cars, and you'll be free to drive around
at leisure, picking up as many spanners and bonus points as you like. Don't
forget to drive around in the opposite direction, though otherwise you'll
finish the race.


***THUNDERBLADE***
When on the title screen type in CRASH, causing the screen to flash quickly,
indicating that the cheat mode is now active. Press UNDO whilst playing to
advance to the next level.


***VETERAN*** : Hitting the HELP key will take you through to the next level.


***VIRUS***
Start the game and hold down ENTER on the keypad. Whilst keeping it depressed,
press P then O. Now when you thrust a third bar will appear below your fuel and
altitude bars. Each of the following keys now have different effects...
L - Gives you an extra missile and hoverplane
D - Turns demo on/off
F - Restores your fuel to full
B - Disables graphics (pretty useless)
N - Turns cheat mode off
C - Disables graphics update (just makes a mess)
