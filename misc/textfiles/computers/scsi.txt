BASIC INSTALLATION PRODCEDURE for SCSI Drives
by Ryan Ramsey   --   June 22, 1992

All Micropolis SCSI drives come pre-formatted from the factory. There is
very little that needs to be done to this type of drive besides setting up 
termination and SCSI ID.

SCSI ID SETTINGS
----------------

    In order for the SCSI bus to be able to tell where it is getting its 
    information from, it is neccessary for each drive to have a particular
    identification number. This identification number, known as the SCSI ID
    is set with jumpers on the back of the drive. All the drives in the SCSI 
    chain must have a different number. 

    These jumpers are located inside the 24-pin connect located on the back 
    of the drive (next to the 50-pin cable connector). 

    If you hold the drive with the cable connectors toward your body and
    the circuit board side facing upwards, you will see the power connector
    on the left, the 50-pin connector in the middle, and the 24-pin connector
    on the right. 

    The jumpers for the 24-pin connector are as follows:

    50-Pin Connector                     24-Pin Connector
    ______________        _________________________________________________
    . . . . . . . |      | o o o . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |
    . . . . . . . |      | o o o . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |
    -------------/        \-----------------------------------------------/
                           | | |
                           | | ID2 (Value 4)
                           | |
                           | ID1 (Value 2)
                           |
                           ID0 (Value 1)

    If this is the going to be the only drive in the system, it should be set
    to SCSI ID 0, which is attained by having NO jumpers in the first 3 pairs
    of the 24 pin connector. For every additional drive, the SCSI ID should
    be incremented by 1. So if you have 3 drives in the system, your primary
    drive should be at SCSI ID 0, your secondary at SCSI ID 1, and your final
    drive at SCSI id 2.

    SCSI ID can be computed as follows by installing jumpers in the following
    pairs of pins:

    SCSI ID    ID0  ID1  ID2       SCSI ID    ID0  ID1  ID2
    ------------------------       ------------------------
       0    |                         4    |             X
       1    |   X                     5    |   X         X
       2    |        X                6    |        X    X
       3    |   X    X                7    |   X    X    X


    Each of the pairs of pins have values (as shown in the diagram). In order
    to get a certain SCSI id, just jumper the pins as you wish and the sum of
    the values is your SCSI ID. So if you have ID0 (value of 1) and ID2
    (value 4) jumpered, your SCSI id will be 5.

    NOTE:   SCSI ID 7, should never be used. This is usually reserved for the
            host adapter.


DRIVE TERMINATION
-----------------

    Termination is something that causes a lot of undue grief for everyone, but
    the concept is really simple.
      
        "Only the last drive in the SCSI chain must be terminated, 
         all others should be un-terminated."
    
              and

        "The SCSI chain must be terminated on both ends."
 
    There are two possible termination configurations.
    
    1.  A HOST ADAPTER WITH ONLY INTERNAL OR ONLY EXTERNAL DRIVES

        This is the most common configuration, and this configuration applies
        to BOTH INTERNAL and EXTERNAL drives. The controller must be terminated
        (which is the way it comes from 99.99% of the manufacturers) AND the
        very last drive/component on the CABLE (do not get "the last drive on
        the cable" confused with the "last drive, which would be the highest
        SCSI ID"). 

        Therefore, a graphic display would look as follows:
           ____
          /    \ External OR Internal 
         | HOST |=====DEVICE=====DEVICE
          \____/        |          |
            |    UN-TERMINATED     |
            |                      |
        TERMINATED             TERMINATED
        (Usually default)

        So once again:

             If you have only one drive, it is to be TERMINATED.
             If you have more than one drive, all drives must be UN-TERMINATED
                except for the last PHYSICAL drive on the CABLE which must 
                be TERMINATED.

    2.  A HOST ADAPTER WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DRIVES

        This setup is a little bit trickier. If you have a host adapter that
        connects internal drives as well as external drives, the HOST ADAPTER
        must be UN-TERMINATED, the LAST drive on the INTERNAL cable must be
        TERMINATED, and the LAST drive on the EXTERNAL cable must be 
        TERMINATED also.

        Therefore, your configuration would look like this.
                                 ____
                Internal        /    \         External
           DEVICE====DEVICE====| HOST |====DEVICE====DEVICE
             |         |        \____/        |         |
             |         |          |           |         |
             |         |    UN-TERMINATED     |         |
         TERMINATED    |                      |     TERMINATED 
                       |                      |
                 UN-TERMINATED          UN-TERMINATED

        So once again, if you have drives on both ends of the controller card,
        the controller card must be UN-TERMINATED, and the last drive on each
        end of the SCSI BUS (Cable) must be TERMINATED.


CABLE INSTALLATION
------------------

        Once the two above items are checked and configured, all you need to
        do then is put the drive on the cable (matching the red stripe on the
        cable to pin one on the controller card) and then power on.


TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
---------------------

     PROBLEM
         2 drives or 7 drives are seen on the SCSI bus when only 1 drive is
         installed on the controller card.
     REMEDY
         Your drive is set to SCSI ID 7, which is what most host adapters are
         set as the default configuration. Change your SCSI id to anything
         other than 7 (also, you cannot use the same ID as another drive).

     PROBLEM
         When booting up the system, the machine gets hung up at the bios
         banner of the controller card.
     REMEDY
         There are a few possibilities for this problem.
          1.  There is a drive set to the same SCSI ID as the controller card.
              Change the conflicting drive to a SCSI ID that is not in use.
          2.  There are two drives with the same SCSI ID.
              Verify that all drives have different SCSI ID's.
          3.  There could be a bios conflict.
              Change the bios address of the controller card to a different
              memory location.
          4.  There could be a conflict with add in boards. Check and make sure
              that there are no memory conflicts with any add in boards or 
              bios's, check DMA's, IRQ's, and port addresses.

      PROBLEM
          When you boot up, the computer gives you a message along the lines
          of "Drive C not found" or "Drive 0 not found".
      REMEDY
          Check your system CMOS. Set both drive 0 and drive 1 to 
          "Not Installed" or 0. CMOS drive settings are for ESDI drives only
          so if you don't have an ESDI drive, it will cause havoc on your
          system.

      PROBLEM
          Drive does not appear to spin up or power-on.
      REMEDY
          Check to see if the power cable is connected and if power is actually
          on. Believe it or not, this is a re-occuring problem.
          If the drive still fails to spin up, check the self test seqence.
          Remove the SCSI cable from the drive and power it on. On the front
          of the drive there is a LED which will blink in a certain sequence.
          If the drive is 'healthy' the light sequence consist of 1 long blink
          and 3 short. If you get anything else or you get a repeating pattern,
          then the drive may be defective and you should call our technical
          support department for further advice.
