    if your PC has XMS memory and the handle parameter set to 128,
    otherwhise you may not be able to view some of the larger .DL files.
    IMPORTANT: DL VIEWER requires DOS 5.0 to work correctly.

                                                                       Page 2

    DELETING A FILE.  To delete a DL file without exiting to DOS you
    can press DEL when this file is at the cursor.
    The file won't be really deleted but just renamed to .BAK.
    You can later delete *.BAK from you DOS Prompt or rename one
    or more files back to .DL to restore them.


    CONVERTING A FILE.  DL VIEWER automatically converts old 2.0 DL
    file format into the new 3.0. It will NOT convert from 1.0, so
    if you still have these old animations please use DL-1TO2.EXE.


    SOUND.  With the 3.0 DL file format you can have music and sound
    into a DL animation file. To hear it you can use your SOUNDBLASTER
    if you have one or your poor SPEAKER. You can select your sound
    device pressing [F2] in menu mode.
    Using the SPEAKER might slow down your system if you're using a 286.
    For now we're just supporting the default address 220H for the
    SOUNDBLASTER card. There might be some problems if you're using
    an old card version (before 2.0).


    KEY SYSTEM. Some animations can be KEY PROTECTED from their author.
    To view them you need to purcase their KEY. Usually you'll find
    a registration form within the archive file containing the animation.
    We give no warranty about these KEYs since they are created from
    the DL MAKER users.


    PASSWORDS. Some animation can be PASSWORD PROTECTED from their
    author. Usually the PASSWORD is free and you can find it on some
    Boards or from the author.
