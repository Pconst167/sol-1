ISO-MPEG Audio Layer 3 software only Encoder and Decoder for PCs
Version 2.61.

Copyright (C) Fraunhofer IIS - 1994, 1995, 1996

This package is distributed as shareware.
DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO REGISTER IS IN THE FILE register.txt.

You may give copies of this package to other people as long as no file
is changed, added or removed.
Without registration, you may work with this package for 30 days, for
evaluation purposes only. "Evaluation" means that you may compress and
decompress sound files only for your private pleasure, to learn about
the performance of the Layer-3 coding scheme.

If you want to extend the evaluation period, or if you want to use
this package not only for your private pleasure, you are required to
register the package. A registration fee is valid for one single
computer with one l3enc/l3dec running.

- evaluate highest quality perceptual audio compression technique
  available today
- software only encoder and decoder implementations
- implements ISO/MPEG Audio standard ISO/IEC-IS 11172-3, Layer 3 and
  ISO/IEC IS-13818-3, Layer 3
- music data is input in raw format (16 bit signed integer), in
  RIFF/WAVE format as used by Microsoft Windows .WAV files, in 
  AIFF/AIFC format as used by SGI and Mac or in .snd/.au format used
  by NeXT and Sun.
- 44.1kHz sampling frequency (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 32 kHz and 48 kHz also
  for registered users)
- output of decoder is in raw format (16 bit signed integer), 
  in .snd/.au format, in AIFF/AIFC format or in RIFF/WAVE format
- .WAV music files can be played with Windows Media Player
- Under rare circumstances the .WAV output is broken. Please use raw format
  in that cases.
- optional decoder output as 24 bit hex ascii data
- written by the very same people at Fraunhofer-IIS who did the 
  Layer 3 codecs for the ISO and ITU-R (former CCIR) tests 
  (best sound quality at low bit rates at all listening tests)
- more information can be found on http://www.iis.fhg.de/departs/amm/layer3/sw/

                   (CR/LF format)
   contents        short discription of the following Layer 3 bitstreams
                   (LF format)
   funky.mp3       demo layer 3 bitstream (96 kbit/s, stereo, 44.1 kHz)
   spot1.mp3       demo layer 3 bitstream (96 kbit/s, stereo, 44.1 kHz)
   spot2.mp3       demo layer 3 bitstream (96 kbit/s, stereo, 44.1 kHz)
   spot3.mp3       demo layer 3 bitstream (96 kbit/s, stereo, 44.1 kHz)
   classic1.mp3    demo layer 3 bitstream (56 kbit/s, stereo, 22.05 kHz)
   classic2.mp3    demo layer 3 bitstream (48 kbit/s, stereo, 22.05 kHz)

The song used for funky.mp3 is named "Funky" and was composed and 
arranged by Juergen Herre. "Funky" is copyright Juergen Herre 1994.
You may use "Funky" for all evaluation purposes of this shareware product.
You may not use "Funky" for commercial purposes (e.g. radio broadcasting).
The other bitstreams were provided by OMNI-Mediasound.

The programms are written for IBM-PCs or Compatibles with MS-DOS. 
They require a 386 type CPU plus hardware floating point support.
Especially for the encoder, a Pentium or better is recommended.
