Introduction to ScanWare and the FCC FRS

ScanWare is the name of a partnership formed in 1993 by two Amateur
Extra Class hams, Matt Amis - AA7LP, and Gene McAvoy - KG7XD.  We
see no sense in boring you with the lurid details of our respective
backgrounds in electronics, computer programming, and scanning. The
program will speak for us.  Numerous comments have been received
comparing this work with some of the other frequency database
programs available.  Perhaps the one we are most fond of compares
the FCC FRS with the 'others' simply by saying that the FCC FRS is
like driving a Mercedes while the 'others' are just Volkswagens.

FCC Database Information

The database structure used in FCC 2.11 is nearly two and one-half
times larger than the one which was provided with FCC 1.15  In
order to enable the user to fully appreciate the significance of
this greatly expanded dataset we are providing detailed
explanations of each field of the database along with other
information to make this data more useful to all.

It is important to note from the beginning that the data which
ScanWare provides to the user is direct from the FCC Master
Frequency List.  No alterations, changes, corrections, or additions
have been made except as noted in the following paragraphs.  Any
errors you may find in the data originated with the FCC or the
person preparing the license application which was then accepted by
the FCC.  We do not intend to imply that the data is flawed, only
that it is the work of many persons throughout the country and its
accuracy only reflects the care taken by the licensees and the FCC
administrators.  Conversations with FCC Field Engineers have
verified to us that some of the data from their files is quite
inaccurate and in some cases missing.

The FCC Database Structure

The FCC frequency lists used in this program were extracted from a
database totaling greater than 1700 megabytes and containing over
3 million individual records.  These records are divided by the FCC
into various subsets.  They have numbered and named each subset as
shown in the following table.

Subset         Name

     1         Broadcast Services
     2         Earth Station & Common Carrier
     3         Common Carrier
     4         Experimental
     5         Common Carrier
     6         Land Mobile 470-512 Mhz
     7         Industrial & Business Services
     8         Public Safety & Land Transportation
     9         Industrial & Business Services
     10        Special Mobile Radio (SMR) & 900 Mhz Services
     11        Aviation & Marine Services

Some interest has been expressed in how these subsets are arranged
in the FCC FRS Version 2.11 file structure.  In order to use the
FCC data as received, certain format conversions must be made. 
These conversions are accomplished with a custom program written
and used exclusively by ScanWare.  The conversion process and more
specific information about the database and the individual data
fields used in the program can be found in Chapter 4.

Main Functions of the FCC FRS

The FCC Frequency Retrieval System (FCC FRS) is the Complete
Database Manager for your IBM compatible computer.  You can search,
sort, extract, and generate frequency lists of many types.  You can
output to disk or printer, and manage your favorite frequency files
as never before.  In short, the FCC FRS can make the FCC Master
Frequency List very easy to work with.

Improvements Since FCC FRS Version 1.0

It's now Mouseable!  The FCC FRS supports mouse action in many
areas of the program.  If you have a mouse and mouse driver
installed, you will find this a new and exciting way to run FCC! 
New look, with graphic screens and menus.  The FCC FRS is a
frequency retrieval system for scanner buffs, so we created a
scanning scanner for the opening intro screen.

Program now supports 25, 43 or 50 line screen modes (depending on
your hardware).

5 new screen savers!  Everything from our own custom opening
screen, stars, smiley faces, and sliding boxes like the ones you've
seen in that "other" program.

New and improved method for selecting active databases.  Change
directories up or down, change drives, search by letter, all within
the selection window.

Conditional Indexing!  Previously, you were forced to use the 6
default indexes as provided by the program. You can now select any
number of indexes to use, from 1 to 12.  This can reduce the disk
space requirement because you no longer have to build indexes on
fields you don't want or don't care about.

Direct method of handling databases.  In prior versions, when you
selected a new database, the program would copy it to a "FCC.DBF"
file.  Not only was this slow, it also required double the disk
space for any database in use.  The program now allows you to
select any valid FCC FRS database and use that file without copying
it.  Changing files has never been faster!  Once selected, the only
requirement is to build new index(es) for the newly selected file. 
Each entry in the database now contains a memo field.  With this,
you can pop-up a window and add any notes or comments you want.
This note is attached to that individual record, so each record in
the database can have as detailed a note as you wish.  The size of
your note is limited only by available memory on your system. 
Improved Custom Report Generator.  Additional operators have been
included to help you define a listing that is "just right" for your
needs.  Screen layouts have been improved and its easier that ever
to define your own custom output.

Full screen pop-up notepad editor!  Create and maintain your own
extensive notes on anything you wish.  Includes block
copy/move/delete, mail merge and much more.  You can edit any
standard text files using the notepad editor.  They don't even have
to be a part of your FCC FRS files.

Pop-up calculator.  What can we say...ScanWare only wants to give
you the best we can offer, and what program would be complete
without a calculator.

Separate any database into an individual city or county database. 
This feature allows you the freedom to work with only specifically-
selected databases which you have defined.

Combine two or more databases into one.  Extract specific pieces of
different databases and combine them all into one to meet your
individual needs.

Renaming databases within the program is easily accomplished in the
Utility section.  You can also delete unwanted records or entire
databases.

Many system settings are now user definable.  Along with complete
color control, you can change delay speeds, screen savers,
background graphics, sound (on or off), and more!  FCC can be run
in either full color or black and white to enhance it's viewability
when used with a portable PC.

The entire system was restructured internally to optimize code and
reduce system memory requirements.  In the rare event that an error
might occur, a new and improved error handler has been added. 
The context sensitive help screens have been greatly expanded and
completely rewritten to reflect the latest improvements.

The new install program allows you to install only the FCC subsets
you are most interested in and it will tell you just how many
records are being installed as well as how much memory space you
will be using.  This method will allow you to optimize your system

Chapter 2 - Getting Started

This chapter explains how to install and start the FCC FRS.  Please
remember that the installation of your program must be accomplished
successfully in order to use the FCC database for your state. 

System requirements

You need the following equipment:

         An IBM PC, PC/XT, PC/AT, PS/2, or 100% compatible
          personal computer

         A 3.5" diskette drive on the PC to run the FCC FRS
          Install program and to load the FCC Data into the
          computer.

         A hard drive with sufficient free space to contain the
          program and data you need for the FRS.

         A black & white or color monitor.

         A printer, while optional is highly recommended.

You also need the following software to run the FCC FRS:

         DOS version 3.3 or later.

Note:  The program has been extensively tested on 286, 386 and 486
systems with CPU speeds from 4.0 to 66 Mhz.  This program was not
designed to operate on a MacIntosh or Commodore computer running in
DOS-Emulation mode and ScanWare will take no responsibility for
programs run on these platforms.

Installing FCC FRS

As you have seen, FCC is not a small program.  Although Version
2.11 deals with some extremely large databases, the program
continues to outperform all of the competition.

In your registered package, you received several disks.  Disk one
(1) contains all of the necessary install and program files, as
well as helps, documentation (this file!) and notes.  Supplementary
disks contain the FCC Master Frequency List subsets for the
state(s) you purchased.

The first thing you should do is make a backup copy of the program
and data disks.  Always use these copies for any work you do with
FCC.  This way, if the work disks are damaged or erased, you can
easily rebuild them from your originals.

To begin the installation, we recommend that you ensure that you
remove any Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) programs that might be
in memory.  While we have never seen any conflicts between FCC and
any TSR, it's always better to be safe than sorry.  You can always
re-install your TSR after you are sure that FCC is in place and
functional.  Additionally, please ensure that your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file does NOT contain any SET CLIPPER= commands.  We have created
both the install program and FCC with the necessary SET CLIPPER
commands already burned in.

Following is a sample CONFIG.SYS file that has been found to work
well with the FCC Frequency Retrieval System.  It is reproduced
here as an example CONFIG.SYS file ONLY, and should be used ONLY
for comparison and guidance:

     DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS            <-- Recommended
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM       <-- Recommended
     BUFFERS=10,0
     FILES=80
     DOS=UMB
     FCBS=16,0
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE           <-- Not essential
     DEVICE=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS             <-- Not essential
     DOS=HIGH
     STACKS=9,256                       <-- Recommended
     SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS\ /E:512 /P

As a side note, the above CONFIG.SYS has been used successfully on
various machines, most notably a 486DX2-66 with 8 megabytes of ram. 
If you have a similar computer configuration, and are having
problems with your FCC FRS, we suggest you try the CONFIG.SYS as
shown.

Additional information for larger database purchasers:

The time it will take to create indexes for very large databases
(California, Texas, Florida, New York, etc.) can be affected by the
amount of expanded memory available to the program.  If you have
combined your various subsets into one large database, we suggest
that you allocate the maximum amount of expanded memory as possible
for FCC s use.

Finally, please be sure you are running a DOS Version 3.30 or
greater and that you have a minimum of 2 megabytes of hard disk
space available.  This does NOT include space for the data subsets.
They will require additional space as identified by the install
program.  Users of Microsoft DOS Version 6.0 are reminded to read
the DOS_6_0.TXT file provide on the program disk.  NOTE: Due to the
size and complexity of FCC Version 2.11, it will NOT install on a

floppy disk.  You must have a hard disk on which to install the
program.

To install FCC FRS Version 2.11, place the program disk into a
floppy disk drive of your choice and change to that drive.  If you
are installing from your Drive A:, place the program disk in drive
A: then type 'A:' and press <Enter> or <Return>.  (NOTE: Do NOT
type the "'" marks around the drive letter, i.e., as an example,
type A:, NOT 'A:'.)  This will set your current path to the correct
drive.  Next, place your Program Disk in drive A:, type 'INSTALL
x:', where 'x' refers to the hard drive name where you want FCC to
be installed.  NOTE: You MUST include the ':' when specifying the
drive or the install program will terminate.  During the install
process, the program will check to ensure that you have sufficient
hard disk space for the FCC FRS program to be installed.  In
addition, the install program will check that all necessary files
were properly copied, etc.  If any were not found, the program will
inform you of the missing file(s) and return to DOS.

During the install, the program will copy all required files from
the program disk onto the drive you have specified and into the
FCC2 directory (which install will create).

Once all of the program files have been successfully copied, a
special program will execute that will prompt you for the various
FCC frequency subsets to install.  The install program is complete
with on-line help screens (at any prompt simply press <F1> for
help.)  In the subset install portion of the program, you will be
given the choice to select any (or all) subsets you wish to
install.  The selection screen provides you with a short definition
of each of the 11 subsets and the number of records contained in
each.  At the bottom of the screen the program will report the
total number of records to be installed, the amount of hard disk
space available, as well as the total hard disk space required for
all selected subsets.  Any subset entry that is darkened, and will
not allow you to enter a 'Y' in the field means that there are no
FCC licensed frequencies for that particular state.  Subsets 2 and
6 are prime examples of this.

NOTE: As we do not know beforehand just which or how many indexes
you may wish to create, we could not anticipate the additional hard
disk space required for your indexes.  Be warned, that building
indexes for FCC requires additional hard disk space beyond that
which is displayed for you! For example: If you have 50 megabytes
of hard disk space available, and select 49 megabytes of files, you
will NOT have enough room to build ANY indexes and FCC will
terminate with an 'insufficient hard disk space' error.  Be sure to
factor this into your selections as you choose which subsets to
install!!

When installation is completed, you will be placed in the FCC2
directory on your hard drive.  To run the FCC FRS, simply type
<FCC> at the DOS prompt and press <Enter>.  The rest is easy! 
Be sure you remove your master Program Disk and place it in a safe
keeping.

Chapter 3 - Beginning to use the FCC FRS

To begin using the FCC Frequency Retrieval System change directory
to C:\FCC2 and type: FCC <Enter>.  The FCC2 directory does not have
to be in the Path statement to use this method.

Sample Session

The following section is a tutorial which illustrates the basic
capabilities of the FCC FRS and may be the only instruction you
will require to begin realizing the programs full potential.

The first screen you will see after starting the program will be
the ScanWare Scanner.  After viewing this intro screen, press any
key to continue.

After the initial installation, you will have no primary database
defined.  When running FCC for the first time, after you have
passed the intro screen, the program will report that no database
has been defined, and whether you wish to define one.  You should
of course select YES!  Once past that prompt, you will be presented
with a list of all available databases.  You will be required to
select one of them to continue.  The install program will place
each selected subset in your FCC2 directory and will be named like
so:

WA2_S1
WA2_S2
.
.
.
WA2_S11

These files can be interpreted as follows:

WA2_S1
≥ ≥ ≥≥ 
≥ ≥ ≥¿ƒ Number of the subset
≥ ≥ ¿ƒƒ S for Subset
≥ ¿ƒƒƒƒ Refers to v2.11 of FCC
¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒ State abbreviation, i.e., WA for Washington

Select one of the available data subsets for your initial install,
and once selected, you will be presented with a list of available
fields with which to build indexes.  You may select up to 12 fields
to build indexes on, but initially, we suggest you select only 2 or
3 to start.

Building indexes

Each database that you select to be your active database requires
at least one (1) index.  These are unique indexes and cannot be
shared across different databases.  That is why when you change
your active database, you are required to build new indexes;
naturally, each data subset contains different records, so it will
require new indexes.

After you have selected your first database, the program will ask
you what indexes you wish to build.  Any field of the database can
become the basis for an index.  You may create up to 12 individual
indexes.  While you are learning to use FCC, we recommend that you
build only three indexes, Freq (Mhz) (the frequency), Licensee
Name, and Transmitter City.

As the indexes are being built you will see the Index File Status
progress bar.  The progress bar will indicate which index is
currently being built and how far along you are in the entire
indexing process.  When this procedure is finished you are returned
to the System Menu.  More information regarding the indexes can be
found in chapter four.

Combining Databases

FCC has been designed to allow users with limited hard disk space
to install only those subsets that are of interest to them.  If you
select all data subsets during the install process, you will end up
with up to 11 databases on disk.  The optimum method for running
FCC is as follows.  Once you have selected an initial database and
build at least one index, from the main menu, select "Combine
databases".  You will be presented with a listing of all available
databases.  Tag each (or all) databases for the combine process. 
This will combine them into a single database (which you can name).
Upon completion of this process you will be returned to the main
menu.  Now for the best part.  You have one database for the entire
state (space permitting).  What most users find useful is to then
extract out of this database only those areas that are in their
city or county.  To do this, change to the Utility menu, and select
the Create City/County Database.  Simply follow the screen prompts,
and when complete, you will have a database that contains all
records for only your city or county.  At the main menu, select
that new database, build some indexes and you are off!

Getting Help

As mentioned above, help can always be obtained by contacting
ScanWare by phone, fax, or BBS.  Immediate help can be obtained
from almost any screen in the program simply by pressing <F1>. When
viewing the Help Screens you can scroll forward and reverse as well

as using the Page Up and Page Down functions.  Each Help Screen can
be immediately output to your printer by pressing <Alt- P>.  In
addition, more help can be gotten by pressing the <F1> key a second
time.  This will bring up the Help Index from which you can view or
print any Help Screen from anywhere in the program.

Browsing the Database

After you have selected a database and created your desired indexes
you may Browse the Database.  Your first screen after selecting
choice number 1 on the System Menu will allow you to tag the
database fields which you wish to include in this browse session.
We suggest for this session that you tag 'All Fields'.  If you
simply move to a single data field and press enter, for example,
FREQ, the program will display a message reminding you that viewing
only a single data field will provide little useful information to
you.  Generally, it will be best to select several fields to view
to better define the service being examined.

You are now operating with the browse window.  In this window the
database is displayed much as data within a spreadsheet is
displayed.  Using the arrow keys your can scroll the view left,
right, up and down.  The Home, End, Page Up and Page Down keys, as
well as Ctrl-versions of these keys are all functional and serve to
move your view to different positions in the database.  In a box at
the bottom of the screen you will see the common commands available
at this point.  Feel free to experiment with these keys.  The
assigned function of each is given later in Chapter 5.  As you
begin to browse the data, you will notice that the first column
does not scroll to the right or left as do all the others.  This
feature can be changed to Lock a different number of columns on the
left side of the screen by pressing 'L' and specifying the desired
number of columns.

Chapter 4 - FCC FRS Basic Operating Principles

This chapter introduces information about the FCC databases and
explains the basic operating principles of the FCC FRS, including
the menu system and use of the keyboard.

The FCC Frequency Database

The Federal Communications Commission is a bureau of the government
which in part is composed of a number of Field Offices.  These
offices are staffed by personnel who perform a variety of functions
from public relations, complaint handling, frequency monitoring,
and public assistance in the filing of license applications.
Although the data contained in the FCC database comes from a
central location near Washington, DC, most of it originates locally
with the licensees.  Because there is a large number of persons
involved in the gathering of this data it inherently contains a
number of errors.  To the casual users these errors may be no more
than a curiosity, to a professional seeking specific information
they can be quite troublesome.

ScanWare makes no attempt to correct any of the data received from
the FCC.  In preparing the FCC data to be used with the Frequency
Retrieval System, the datasets are limited to the standard range of
10 Khz through 2036 Mhz, (unlimited frequency datasets which
generally cover from 0 to 300 GHz are optionally available). A
utility function is used to provide counties and zip codes in some
cases where this information is missing and can be supplied from a
known correct source.  Next, a complete character-by-character
comparison is made of each data element and any records which are
exact duplicates of any others are eliminated.  After converting
the database to the format used by the FCC FRS, we make NO OTHER
MODIFICATIONS to the original FCC data.

In extracting data for a given state from the master file two
fields are used as indexes, the Licensee State and the Transmitter
State.  This method ensures that a complete picture of the data for
each state will be obtained.  Each data subset is given a unique
filename which identifies both the state and the subsets which it
contains.  For example, the FCC FRS Version 2.11 Subset 1 for
Washington State is given the filename, WA2_S1.  Subset 10 of the
same state would be WA2_S10.  Some states, such as California and
Texas have certain subsets which are too large to fit on one floppy
disk.  These are identified in a similar manner but with an
additional code.  California Subset 9 is one such large dataset and
has been named CA2_S9A and CA2_S9B.

No ordering or sorting of the files is done during the conversion
process.  The reason for this is that FCC FRS uses the indexes that
you select for sorting.  After your indexes are prepared, FCC can

instantly find the items you are seeking.  Even on the slowest of
computers you will not notice any delay as the program executes
searches at your request.

Much thought and planning has gone into the preparation of this
data and in the formats of each element as used in the FCC FRS. The
key to understanding the FCC data supplied with your program is a
fundamental knowledge of the FCC subsets, the fields comprising the
data structure and the meaning of the information contained in each
field.  Listed below are the individual data fields supplied with
the FCC FRS and information on each to help you better appreciate
their meaning.

The FCC FRS database structure contains 31 fields of fully editable
information for each individual record.  The fields and a brief
description of each follows.

FREQUENCY      This field contains the frequency of operation for
               each individual record.  For some records the
               listed frequency may not reflect an actual
               operating frequency but may only indicate the band
               in which the licensee was granted operation.  This
               often occurs when a candidate submits an
               application for licensure in a particular radio
               service prior to completing a frequency study to
               determine the exact operating frequency desired. 
               Another item which may be found in this position is
               the lower end of a band of frequencies in which the
               licensee may operate.  This kind of entry will
               appear in digits that are brighter than the others
               indicating that a frequency range is associated
               with this entry.  The upper-end limit of the range
               will then be shown in the field labeled FREQ HIGH
               LIMIT.

CALLSIGN       Most often the format of a callsign will identify
               it as either a base or a mobile station.  Callsigns
               always begin with a characters and end with
               numerals.  The usual pattern for a fixed base
               station is three-by-three or four-by-three such as
               KMA357 or KKNB262.  Most mobile units are
               identified as a two-by-four or two-by-five such as
               KA2356 or KB46634.  At the present time the FCC is
               assigning one callsign to entire systems of base
               and mobile units which explains why mobile units
               may sometimes identify with the same callsign as
               the base station.  Stations are required to
               identify on a regular basis.  This is often
               accomplished automatically with a CW identification.

LICENSEE NAME  The name under which the licensee is doing business
               (DBA Name).  This field contains only the first 40
               characters of the FCC's 100 character field.

LICENSEE CITY  The home city of the licensee as it appears on the
               station operating license.  This might not be
               anywhere near the location of the actual
               transmitting facility.

LICENSEE STATE This is the state shown on the FCC license. 

LICENSEE ZIP   As above.

SERVICE CODE   The FCC designation for the radio service in which
               this license is granted.  See the on-line help file
               for a complete listing of the FCC service codes.

STATION CLASS  This field defines the class of station licensed,
               such as;

               FB   Fixed Base,
               MO   Mobile,
               FX3  Fixed Repeater Station.

               See the on-line help for a complete listing of
               station classes.

XMIT CITY      The city in which the transmitter is located.

XMIT COUNTY    The county in which the transmitter is located. 

XMIT STATE     The state in which the transmitter is located. 

XMIT LAT       Transmitter latitude given in HHH MM SS format. 

XMIT LONGITUDE Transmitter longitude in HH MM SS format. 

XMIT ELEV      Transmitter location elevation in feet above sea
               level.

XMIT HGHT      Radiating antenna height above ground level in
               feet. 

XMIT HAAT      Antenna height above average terrain in feet.

XMIT EFF       Height above ground to the center of the radiating
               antenna in feet.

XMIT STRUH     Height in feet of the of the entire structure on
               which the antenna is mounted or height of the tip
               of the highest antenna on the structure.

RADIUS OF OP.  Radius of operation of the station in miles from
               the given latitude and longitude.

ANTENNA POLAR. Electrical orientation of the antenna.  This
               information is helpful to know when determining
               proper antenna mounting orientation, i.e.
               H-Horizontal, V-Vertical, etc.

ERP            Effective radiated power as calculated from
               transmitter power output, feedline loss, and
               antenna gain.

POWER OUT      Transmitter power output  Note: The ERP and POWER
               OUT were two areas that FCC Field Engineers
               verified as being particularly error prone.

EMISSIONS      Coded listing of licensees bandwidth and emission
               type. See on-line help for examples and further
               information.

NR_MOB_???     (VEH, PRT, AIR, MAR, PAG) Number of Vehicular,
               Portable, Air Mobile, Marine Mobile, and Pager type
               units licensed for operation on a given system.

FREQ HI LIMIT  High end of licensees allowable frequency range. 

PL             Field provided by ScanWare for PL codes which can
               be added by the user as desired.  This field
               currently accepts only numerical PL values which
               corresponds with the actual tone frequencies used.
               For users who desire to use other coding methods
               such as alphanumerics or alphabetic, ScanWare
               suggests using the Memo field for each record
               concerned.  The Federal Communications Commission
               does not track PL codes at all.

NOTES          A free-form memo field provided by ScanWare for the
               convenience of the user.  Actually a small but
               fully functional word processor.  See Memo Field
               Editor later in the documentation for more
               information.

Elevator Bar

As you scroll up and down through the window, the indicator will
move up and down on the status bar, showing you where you are
relative to the first and last fields.  If there are more options
above the first field shown in the window, an up arrow will be
displayed at the upper right corner of the box.  If there are more
options below the last element shown, a down arrow will be drawn at
the lower right corner of the box.

Tagging Multiple Fields

You can tag any items by highlighting an item and pressing the
space bar. If you press <F8>, you will tag all items in the window.
If you press <F9>, you will untag all items.  Pressing <F10> will
toggle each tagged item to the opposite of what it was; i.e., if
item 1 was tagged and item 2 was not tagged, after pressing <F10>
item 1 will not untagged and item 2 will be tagged.  In addition to
the <F8>, <F9>, and <F10> keys, you also can do a group tagging
with the <F7> key.  Highlight the first item to be tagged and press
<F7>.  Then move to the last item and press <F7> again.

Progressive Searching

When you press a letter key, you jump to the next field that begins
with that letter.  As you continue to enter letters, the program
will continue to search, performing a progressive search on the
string.  This search function is not case sensitive.

Screen Savers

Many people leave their workstations in the middle of a program and
forget to come back until much later.  Blanking the screen is
useful for saving wear and tear on the monitor, and is just plain
entertaining in these situations.  The program will wait a
specified number of seconds for a keypress, and if none is
detected, clears the screen.  It then displays one of five
different screen blankers now built into the FCC FRS.  Selecting
your screen saver is easily accomplished in the System
Configuration mode.

The screens available are numbered 1 through 5 and are described
below:

     1)   The FCC FRS Scanning Scanner Graphic.
     2)   Clears the screen and displays a saved message.  "Press
          any key to return to the program"
     3)   A small smiley-face dancing randomly on the screen.
     4)   The planetarium screen saver complete with twinkling
          stars.

     5)   A Sliding Block screen saver.

Clearing The Screen

This function lets you choose nine interesting ways of clearing the
screen.

     1)   Window shade being pulled down
     2)   Window shade being yanked up
     3)   Barn door being closed to the right
     4)   Barn door being closed to the left
     5)   Curtains opening from center of screen
     6)   Curtains closing to center of screen
     7)   Camera lens shutting
     8)   Diagonal Wipe
     9)   Vertical halves

Custom Color Configuration

This function allows you to view, modify, and optionally save all
of the color settings. You may also toggle between color and
monochrome via this function.  It displays all the internal color
settings on the screen. To modify a color setting, use the arrow
keys to move to the desired setting and press <Enter>.  This will
pop up the color palette and allow you to change the setting to
your favorite color.

FCC 2.11 allows you a wide latitude when changing your color
scheme. With this much flexibility, it is entirely possible to mess
the colors up so bad, that you wish to start all over.  Simple.  To
restore the colors to their default, simply delete the file FCC.CFG
and re-start FCC.  All colors will be reset to their original state
(where you can do it all again!)  Also, if you do not select a main
screen background character, then the color choice for the screen
background will only show the chosen background color.

Window Borders

Most "windows" in the program can have the borders re-defined to
suit your particular tastes.  Six border types are available:

Border    Border Type                        Example

     1)   Double                             …ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕª
                                             »ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕº
     2)   Single                             ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø
                                             ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ
     3)   Double Horiz., Single Vert.        ’ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕ∏
                                             ‘ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕæ

     4)   Single Horiz., Double Vert.        ÷ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ∑
                                             ”ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒΩ
     5)   Thick Line                         ‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹
                                             €‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹‹€
     6)   No border

Most windows can have a delay set, which is used to delay the
"explosion".  The larger the delay, the longer the box drawing
operation will take.  We recommend using values between 1 and 20,
but you should experiment with this to discover what setting works
best with your particular hardware.

Browse Window Commands

This is a powerful database browser, which includes locking columns
and viewing data subsets without setting filters.

The following keys are active while in the browse window:

     Key            Action

     Left Arrow     Move left one column
     Right Arrow    Move right one column
     Up Arrow       Move up one row
     Down Arrow     Move down one row
     PgUp           Display previous screen
     PgDn           Display next screen
     Ctrl-Home      Move to leftmost column
     Ctrl-End       Move to rightmost column
     Ctrl-PgUp      Move to top of file
     Ctrl-PgDn      Move to bottom of file
     Ctrl-Left      Pan entire screen left
     Ctrl-Right     Pan entire screen right
     Enter          Edit current cell
     Alt-I          Switch active index
     Home           Jump to beginning of previous subgroup
                    (w/active index)
     End            Jump to beginning of next subgroup (w/ active
                    index)
     L              Lock columns
     Alt-I          Switch active index
     Alt-S          Create subset (w/ active index)
     +              Expand current column by one
     -              Shrink current column by one
     Alt-Plus       Expand current column by five
     Alt-Minus      Shrink current column by five

Swapping Indexes <Alt-I>

If you have two or more index files open, you may switch between
them by pressing <Alt-I>. This means that you could have one index
on Frequency and another on Licensee Name, etc., and switch back
and forth between them for searches.

Editing Individual Fields

When you highlight a field and press <Enter>, you can edit it
directly without going to a full screen view.  If you wish to edit
the same field in a series of records, you can terminate the edit
on that one field by pressing the down arrow, which will move you
down one record and pop you immediately into edit mode.

Left/Right Arrows

If there is data off the screen to the left or right, an arrow will
appear on the bottom row at the left or right corner, respectively.

System Main Menu

The system main menu is described in the following section. 
The main menu supports the following keys:

     Key            Action

     Up Arrow       move up one option, or if at first option,
                    jump to last option
     Down Arrow     move down one option, or if at last option,
                    move to first option
     Home           jump to first option
     End            jump to last option
     PgUp           jump to first option
     PgDn           jump to last option
     Enter          select highlighted option & exit
     Esc            exit and return to DOS

It should be clear that if an option has been selected which does
not seem to perform as understood that the user is always free to
abort the function by pressing <Esc> and beginning a new operation
or by pressing <F1> to seek help.

Browse Window Functions

The Browse Window as the name implies is where most casual 'looking
around' is done in the FCC FRS.  This is the area to enjoy while
simply wandering through the many database entries.  The arrow keys
and the page keys provide for movement and the operating keys are

shown in the box below the browse window.  Specific keypress
actions are covered in Chapter 5.

Custom Report Generator

The Custom Report Generator is the area in which you may define
specific parameters for the data to be output into a report of your
own choosing.  This is also the area where you may define a custom
database for your own specific purposes.

This powerful utility allows you to create and save complex queries
(filters) for any database file.  The queries are stored in the
files QUERIES.DBF and QUERIES.DBT.  These files will be created
automatically if they don't already exist.

Viewing and Selecting a Custom Report

When you enter the query builder, you will see a window containing
descriptions of all available queries which are connected to your
currently active database.

     Available Options

     Up Arrow       Move highlight bar up one query
     Down Arrow     Move highlight bar down one query
     <F7>           Count records matching current query
     <F8>           Delete current query
     <F9>           View criteria for current query
     <F10>          Create a new query
     Enter          Run current query
     Esc            Exit the query module

Press <F7> to count the records that match the criteria for the
highlighted query.  This may take a few moments for large files
because the program must scan the entire active database.

Press <F8> to delete the highlighted query. You will be asked to
confirm your request. Please note that this option will physically
delete the query and pack the memo files as well, rather than
simply marking the record for deletion.

Pressing <F9> will pop up a window showing the criteria for the
highlighted query.  You may use the up and down arrow keys to
scroll through the criteria.  Press <Esc> to return to the query
window.

Pressing <Enter> will run the query on your active database file.
If no records fit the criteria, you will receive a message to that
effect.

Creating a New Query

Viewing Field Names and Descriptions

Pressing <F10> from the query window will bring up the criteria
screen.  A scrolling window containing the field names of the
selected database (or alternate descriptions) will appear on the
right side of the screen.

The following commands are available:

     Enter          Select current field
     Up Arrow       Move highlight bar up
     Down Arrow     Move highlight bar down
     Letters (A-Z)  Move highlight bar to the next field that
                    begins with letter

If you attempt to move past the first or last query description,
you will get a reminder tone.

Selecting an Operator

Pressing Enter will bring up the operators selection window, which
contains the following choices:

     1)   Equal to
     2)   Less than
     3)   Greater than
     4)   Less than or equal to
     5)   Greater than or equal to
     6)   Not equal to
     7)   Contains
     8)   Sounds like

Use the up and down arrow to select the desired operator, then
press <Enter> to continue.

Selecting a Value

When you have selected an operator, another window will appear
beneath the operators window.  This window will contain the field
name and the operator.  Type in the desired value for this field,
then press <Enter> to continue.

If you wish to see all of the available values in your database,
you may press <Alt-V> to pop up a scrolling window of values.  You
may select one of these as the value for your query by highlighting
it and pressing <Enter>, or you may press <Esc> to exit without
making a selection.

Selecting a Boolean Operator

When you have entered the value, another window will appear below
the value window. This window will contain the following choices: 
     1)   "Discard"
     2)   " .AND. "
     3)   " .OR. "
     4)   "( ... .AND. "
     5)   "( ... .OR. "
     6)   " .AND. ("
     7)   " .OR.  ("
     8)   ") .AND. "
     9)   ") .OR. "
     10)  ") .AND. ("
     11)  ") .OR. ("
     12)  "<done>"

Move the highlight bar to the desired selection and press <Enter>.
Note: The two options with leading open parentheses can only be
used on the first query criterion.  The options involving a closed
parenthesis will be unavailable unless there is at least one open
parenthesis in the query criteria.

Ending the Query

When you have finished building the criteria for this query, select
"<done>" from the Boolean operator window.  You will then be asked
to enter a description for this query for your future reference.
This description may contain up to 50 characters.  Press <Enter>
when you are finished entering the description, and you will be
returned to the query window.  If you want to exit without saving
this query, press <Esc>.

If you wish to run this query immediately without saving it for
future use, simply leave the description empty and press <Enter>. 
Selecting a New Database

During the option of selecting a new active database, you are given
the opportunity to change drives and directories.  Should you do
this, be aware that any indexes you had in the previous directory
will not be deleted.  The program will delete/build indexes only in
the directory which contains the database selected.  To prevent
running out of disk space, we suggest that if at all possible, you
leave all data files in the same directory.  With the ability to
switch between files, extract counties and combine files, you will
have far less problems with all data in the same directory. 
It's important to note that you cannot combine databases on
different drives or directories.  For example, the pick window will
give you a listing of all database files in one directory only, so

you will be unable to tag files that may reside elsewhere. 
Indexing

The indexing concept used in the FCC FRS is a unique ScanWare
innovation designed specifically to enable faster searches of the
database and to save the user much hard drive space.  You may
construct from 1 to 12 indexes using any combination of fields. 
Although for general record searching it is handy to have a number
of different indexes with which to work, it must be remembered that
each additional index requires a large portion of your hard disk
memory.  See Advanced Memory Management later in this document.

Combining Databases

Another feature unique to the FCC FRS is the ability to combine two
or more databases into one database.  This allows you to create
your own very specific databases and then to eliminate from your
system any areas of non-interest.  The construction of custom
databases requires some knowledge of database management which is
beyond the scope of this documentation.

Separating a Database by City or County

As an adjunct to the above function the FCC FRS provides you with
a utility which will extract and create a database of either a
single city or county database.  Upon selecting this option, the
program will ask if you wish to build a single county or city
database.  This ability gives you a simple opportunity to create
only a single file for your particular county or city.

Utility Menu

A Utility Menu selection has been provided which will take you to
another program level where utility functions are performed.  Each
is outlined in the following paragraphs.

Remove Deleted Records

Individual records in a database may be marked for deletion while
in the Browse Window by pressing 'D'.  These records are not
physically deleted until you enter the Utility Menu and choose
selection one, Remove Deleted Records.  Once deleted, these records
cannot be recovered without reloading the original database. 

Rename a Database File

This selection allows you to rename any of the database files on
your system.  This is particularly useful when constructing custom
databases.

Delete a Database File

This selection allows you to delete any unwanted database files. 
System Configuration

Many of the system operating parameters may be modified to suit the
users individual taste.  Since there are so many variables involved
it is quite possible that even the expert user might not be
satisfied with his modified configuration.  You can restore your
program to the original ScanWare defaults simply by exiting the
program, deleting the file named FCC.SET, and then restarting the
program.  The original defaults will be restored.

Password Protection

FCC FRS 2.11 includes a simple password protection routine that can
be used during program startup.  This password scheme conforms to
NO encryption standards and is supplied only as a very minor,
simple method to keep unwanted prying eyes from gaining access to
your program.

If you opt to use a password in FCC, it will be stored in the
FCC.SET file.  Should you ever forget your password, the easiest
fix is to delete the FCC.SET file and re-start FCC (pretty simple,
huh?)  This will build a default configuration file with system
defaults (which does not include a password).  You must then run
the system configuration option to re-set any specific settings you
may have had.

Mouse Sensitivity

If you have a mouse installed in your system, you will have the
mouse cursor visible at program start-up.  The mouse can be used
for menu selections, browsing, and highlighting.  Within the System
Configuration menu you will find a setting for Double Click
Sensitivity.  This allows you to set double-click sensitivity. By
default, this sensitivity level is 250 milliseconds.

Shell to DOS

Choosing this selection will transfer you from the FCC FRS into a
DOS screen where you can perform most ordinary DOS functions.  To
exit from DOS and return to the Utility Menu type: 'EXIT' <Enter>.

Chapter 5 - Special Features

This chapter deals with many of the Special Features of the FCC
FRS.  These enhancements have been added for the convenience of the
user.  Some are highly modifiable and can become quite useful with
just a bit of familiarization.

FCC FRS Keys

A table of 'hot-keys' is shown at the bottom of the browse window. 
These powerful keys control the major functions of the program.
Some, such as Add and Delete need little explanation.

A]dd / E]dit   You can Add new records to the database whenever
               you wish to do so.  When using this function you
               must be aware that only those fields which you
               selected to view will appear on the Add-Record
               Screen.  All other fields will be available but
               must be entered either from an All Fields add mode
               or from an All Fields edit mode.  The Edit mode
               operates similar to the Add mode but presents the
               currently selected record for editing.

D]el           The Delete key serves to physically delete any     
               unwanted records from the database.  Be aware that
               once a record has been deleted from the database it
               cannot be recovered except by reloading the entire
               data file.  The program will ask you to verify each
               deletion before it is done.

S]rch          Srch (search) allow you to track down specific
               records.  The Srch command operates from the browse
               window and performs an intuitive search using the
               currently selected index.  For example: suppose you
               have selected the Licensee Name field as your
               active index.  When you press <S> a small window in
               the upper margin of the browse screen will open. 
               Within this window you may enter a data item
               corresponding to the selected index.  You will
               notice as you enter each letter the database view
               is instantly shifted to match your entry.  You may
               press the backspace key to reverse your search at
               any time.

               NOTE: If you are performing a search using the Freq
               (Mhz) Field as your index, you must enter '000' as
               the first three digits before the program will
               respond.  Example:  To search for '158.880' you
               must enter '000158.88'.

V]iew          The View command presents you with a complete
               picture of the selected data item.  All fields and
               their contents are shown on the screen.  From this
               screen you may use the up or down arrows or press
               <N> or <P> to view the Next or Previous record.

P]rint         You can output to print all records, or those
               matching the active subset selection (if you have
               defined one).  Output will respect any data subset
               that you may have set with the Alt-S function
               described below.

L]ock          The Lock feature allows you to lock a number of the 
               leftmost columns on the screen while you continue
               to horizontally scroll the rightmost columns.

[Alt-S]        The subset selection function allows you to define 
               a specific portion of the active database for
               exclusive viewing.  Using the currently selected
               index as a criteria, the <Alt-S> function will
               bring up a window where you may define the limits
               of your subset.  The default low value and high
               value settings are equal to the currently
               highlighted record.  These may be changed as
               desired.

[Alt-I]        The <Alt-I> cycles you to the next available index
               file if more than one index was created.

Notepad Editor

The Notepad Editor is in fact a small and highly functional word
processor.  It can be used to edit any text-based file both within
the FCC FRS or anywhere on the users system.  To access the notepad
editor anywhere in the program, simply press <Alt-F9> to bring it
up.

This notepad lets you do text block commands (move/copy/delete),
cut-and-paste from the underlying screen, the ability to create and
do mail merging by inserting fieldnames into your documents and
much more.

     Active Keys

     Alt-A          (A)ppend a file to current file
     Alt-B          Place block marker (or execute block command
                    if both block markers have already been
                    placed)
     Alt-F          insert (F)ield (for mail merging)
     Alt-G          (G)oto line number

     Alt-H          (H)elp screen listing all commands
     Alt-I          (I)nsert buffer

     Alt-W          (W)rite to new file
     Alt-X          e(X)it immediately without saving
     Alt-Y          change director(Y)/wildcard

Edit Window/Status Line

When you enter the notepad, the edit window takes up nearly the
full screen.  You will be prompted to enter the name of the file
you wish to edit.  There is a status line at the bottom of the
screen, which displays the name of the file being edited (minus the
directory), the current line and column position of the cursor, the
left and right margins, and the status of wordwrap and insert modes
(displayed when active as "<Wrap>" and "<Ins>" respectively).  When
a file has been edited, an asterisk will appear at the right side
of the top row next to the "Alt-H=Help" message.

Current Directory/Wildcard

The notepad gives you the ability to change the working directory
and/or filemask at any time.  When you first enter the notepad, the
current directory will be set to the default DOS directory, and the
wildcard will be set to "*.*".  If you would like to change either
the directory where the notepad looks for files or the wildcard
used (e.g., "*.TXT", "*.DOC"), press <Alt-Y> and enter the new
information.

You do not have to enter slashes in front or back of the directory
name UNLESS you include a wildcard.  For example, to change the
current directory to "\FCC2\" you need only enter "FCC2".  However,
if you want the notepad to look for all the .TXT files in
subdirectory FCC2, you must enter "\FCC2\*.TXT".

If you enter just the wildcard, the current directory will remain
unchanged.  If you enter a directory name only, the wildcard will
be reset to "*.*".  If you press <Enter> without typing in
anything, neither the current directory nor the wildcard will be
changed.

Examples: let's suppose that your application is in a subdirectory
named \FCC2.  The initial current directory/wildcard will be set to
"\FCC2\*.*".  If you press <Alt-Y> and type "*.DOC" then press
<Enter>, the directory/wildcard will be changed to "\FCC2\*.DOC".
If you wish to change to the \WASH subdirectory, press <Alt-Y> and
type "WASH" then press <Enter>.  The directory/wildcard will then
be changed to "\WASH\*.*".  Suppose then you want to look at only
the .DOC files starting with the letter 'P' in the directory
\FCC2\NOTES. You would press <Alt-Y> again, and type in
"\FCC2\NOTES\P*.DOC".

Files - Changing, New, Default

When you press <Alt-N> to edit a new file or <Alt-W> to write to
another file, a scrolling window will appear containing all files
that match the current directory and wildcard mask.  The directory
and wildcard mask will be shown at the top of this window for
reference.  Note that files with the following extensions will not
appear in this directory, based on the assumption that there should
be no need to edit binary files: .EXE, .COM, .DBF, .NTX, .DBT,
.NDX, .OBJ.

To select a file, move the highlight bar to it and press <Enter>.
To create a new file, select the option "NEW FILE", then enter the
filename.  Pressing <Esc> will abort the file selection process. 
If you attempt to write to a file that already exists, or append
from a file that does not exist, you will get a non-fatal error
message to that effect.

<Alt-B>: Block Commands

Blocks of text may be deleted, copied, moved, printed, or case
converted.  You must first mark a block by pressing <Alt-B> at the
beginning, and again at the end of the block.  If you wish to move
or copy this text block, move to the target location.  Then press
<Alt-B> again to get a pop-up menu of block commands ("Move",
"Copy", "Kill", "Print", "Uppercase", "Lowercase", "Erase
Markers").  Select one by highlighting it and pressing <Enter>. 

<Alt-F>: Field Insertion for Mail Merging

You can easily insert fields from any or all open databases into
your documents to create merge mailings.  Note that this feature
will only be available if a database is open when the notepad is
called.

First, move the cursor to the location where you wish to insert the
field.  Then press <Alt-F> to display a window containing all
available fieldnames (along with the corresponding database or
alias names).  Move the highlight bar to the desired field name and

press <Enter> to insert it, or press <Esc> to exit without
inserting a field.

Notice that the alias and fieldname are surrounded by curly braces,
"{" and "}".  When the document is printed, anything that is
surrounded by curly braces will be replaced by the actual contents
of the appropriate field.  However, you can also embed function
names within the curly braces.  For example, if you wanted to make
sure that a field NAME was printed in upper-case, you could modify
"{NAME}" to read "{UPPER(NAME)}".  As you will discover, this will
open up many avenues of customization.  If you decide to insert
function names such as this, you should be sure that the
function(s) called has been linked into your program.  But have no
fear; if an undefined function or expression is inserted, rather
than crashing your program when you try to print, the notepad will
merely replace that expression with a null string.

Insert/Wordwrap

The start-up values for these modes is on.  They may toggled off
and on at any time by pressing <Insert> and <Alt-W>, respectively.
The status of these modes appears at the right side of the status
line.  Also, the cursor size will change from large (insert) to
small (overwrite) based on the current mode, just like a "real"
word processor.

<Alt-K>: Cut and Paste

You may cut and paste portions of the underlying screen into the
paste buffer, which can then be inserted into your document.  Press
<Alt-K> to restore the underlying screen.  Use the arrow keys to
place the cursor at the beginning of the block to be marked.  Then
press <Enter> to begin highlighting the block.  Move the arrow keys
to highlight the desired block and press <Enter> once again when
you are finished.  This block will then be loaded into the paste
buffer for future insertion with <Alt-I>.  If you begin to
highlight an area and then change your mind, you can press <Esc> to
exit without changing the contents of the paste buffer.

<Alt-I>: Insert Buffer

This option allows you to insert the contents of the paste buffer
into your document at the current cursor location.  The paste
buffer will contain either the result of a kut-and-paste <Alt-K>
operation, or a text block <Alt-B>.  If you want to see what is in
the buffer before you insert it, press <Alt-V> to view it.

<Alt-L>: Page Length

The start-up page length for printing is 60 lines.  You can change
this at any time by pressing <Alt-L>.

<Alt-M>: Margins

The start-up margins are 1 and 80.  However, you may change these
margins at any time by pressing <Alt-M> and entering the desired
values.  When you change the margins, the on-screen display will
adjust to reflect the new margins.  You may use larger values for
the right margin than would appear on the 80-column screen.  In
such instances, you should toggle wordwrap off and scroll to the
right to display text beyond the on-screen right margin.  The
current values of the margins appear on the status line.

<Alt-P>: Printing

You may print the current file at any time by pressing <Alt-P>.
Printing may be aborted at any time by pressing <Esc>.  The format
of the printed page is determined by the current settings of the
margins and page length.

Mail Merging

If you have inserted fields in this document and wish to print a
merge mailing for more than one record in your database, you can
make one quick and easy modification to allow your users to select
which records in the database should be processed.

<Alt-R>: Search and Replace

You can search and replace for all or for only a specific number of
occurrences of a character string.  When you press <Alt-R>, you
will be prompted first to enter the search string, then the
replacement string.  You will then be asked if you want to replace
all occurrences of the search string.  If you answer "N", you will
be prompted to enter the number of occurrences to replace.  Please
note  that the search begins at the top of the file and continues
either to the end of the file or until the specified number of
occurrences have been replaced.

<Alt-V>: View Buffer

Use this option if you want to view the contents of the paste
buffer. This will show you what will be inserted into your document
if you press <Alt-I>.

File Size Limitations

Although theoretically you could load and edit files up to 64K It
is certainly possible to run out of memory when loading a file much
smaller than that.  As a rule of thumb, you must at least twice the
size of the file to be edited available in RAM; for example, to
edit a 20K file, there should be 40K available.

Memo Field Editor

The Memo Field Editor is much like the Notepad Editor described
above however its functional area is limited to the Memo Fields
within the FCC FRS.  To facilitate editing the text, there are a
number of different navigation and editing keys:

     Key                      Action

     Up arrow/Ctrl-E          Move up one line
     Dn arrow/Ctrl-X          Move down one line
     Left arrow/Ctrl-S        Move left one char
     Right arrow/Ctrl-D       Move right one char
     Ctrl-Left arrow/Ctrl-A   Move left one word
     Ctrl-Right arrow/Ctrl-F  Move right one word
     Home                     Move to beginning of current line
                              End Move to end of current line
     Ctrl-Home                Move to beginning of current window
     Ctrl-End                 Move to end of current window
     PgUp                     Move to previous edit window
     PgDn                     Move to next edit window
     Ctrl-PgUp                Move to beginning of memo
     Ctrl-PgDn                Move to end of memo
     Return                   Move to beginning of next line
     Delete                   Delete character at cursor
     Backspace                Delete character to left of cursor
     Tab                      Insert tab character or spaces
     Printable characters     Insert character
     Ctrl-Y                   Delete the current line
     Ctrl-T                   Delete word right
     Ctrl-B                   Reform paragraph
     Ctrl-V/Ins               Toggle insert mode
     Ctrl-W                   Finish editing with save
     Esc                      Abort edit and return

When the user is entering text, there are two text entry modes,
while the rest of the text buffer remains in its current position. 
As the user enters text and the cursor reaches the edge of the MEMO
window, the current line wraps to the next line in the text buffer.
To explicitly start a new line or paragraph, the user must press
<Enter>.

Word wrap: The MEMO editor inserts a soft carriage return/linefeed
at the closest word break to the window border or line length,
whichever occurs first.

Reforming paragraphs: Pressing <Ctrl-B> reformats the text buffer
until a hard carriage return (end of paragraph) or the end of the
text buffer is reached.

Calculator

The Calculator utility was included simply for the convenience of
the user.  To access the notepad editor anywhere in the program,
simply press <Alt-F10> to bring it up.

The calculator includes all the basic operators: addition(+),
subtraction(-), multiplication(*), and division(/). It also has
some other goodies, including exponentiation (^), percentages (%),
configurable decimal display and rounding, a paste function and a
full-featured memory.  Plus, whenever you press an operator ('+',
'-', '*', '/', or '^'), the previous number is shown above the
display window.  This is handy for when you are processing a list
of numbers and forget where you were.  Finally, if the calculator
is blocking some important information on the screen, you can move
it out of the way with the navigation keys! The maximum value that
can be stored in the calculator is
99,999,999,999.9999.

     Active Keys

     '+'            addition
     '-'            subtraction
     '*'            multiplication
     '/'            division
     '^'            exponentiation
     '%'            percentage

     Other Active Keys

     'C'            clear current number
     'E'            clear entry
     'D'            change number of decimals displayed
     'R'            round to specified number of decimals
     'P'            print (adding machine mode)
     'M'            Memory operations
     '='            process operation
     Enter          process operation
     Backspace      erase last digit entered
     Esc            exit Calculator

Memory Functions

To access memory functions, press "M" then one of the flashing
function keys.  The function keys are:

     'R'            recall number stored in memory
     'C'            clear memory (reset to zero)
     '+'            add current number to memory
     '-'            subtract current number from memory
     '*'            multiply memory by current number
     '/'            divide memory by current number

Print - Adding machine mode

By pushing "P" for Print, the calculator emulates an adding
machine.  This will be noted by a small "P" to the right of the
number window.  Each calculation will be sent to the printer (if it
is on-line).  After all, if you have invested several thousand
dollars in PC hardware (and software), why spend more money on a
ten-key adding machine?  Press "P" again to toggle adding machine
mode off.

User-Defined Color/Position

The color and screen position of the calculator window may be
changed "on-the-fly".  The following keys may be used:

     UpArrow        move calculator up one row
     DnArrow        move calculator down one row
     LtArrow        move calculator left one column
     RtArrow        move calculator right one column
     Ctrl-LtArrow   move calculator to far left
     Ctrl-RtArrow   move calculator to far right
     Home           move calculator to top left corner
     End            move calculator to bottom right corner
     PgUp           move calculator to top row
     PgDn           move calculator to bottom row
     Alt-F10        change color of calculator window

Pressing Alt-F10 will display the interactive color palette. You
may change the color by using the arrow keys to navigate through
the palette.  Press Enter to select the desired color.  If you
press Esc, the color will be unchanged.  Any changes made will only
be good  for that session.

On-Line Help and Error Messages

The FCC FRS is equipped with a universal key for On-line Help.
Pressing <F1> from almost any screen location will bring up a help
file for the area in which you are working.  If no specific help is

available you may access the Help Index at any time.  This is done
by pressing the <F1> a second time.

System Error Messages

Any errors encountered will display a box with a descriptive
message in it, along with several beeps, and will pause program
execution until you press any key.

We have enabled a powerful error message utility within the FCC
FRS.  Despite exhaustive alpha and beta testing periods there may
always be an unplanned or unattempted operation which just hasn't
been seen before.  If such an event occurs and results in the
program aborting, a built-in error documenting utility will take
over and generate a diagnostic file to enable ScanWare to eliminate
the problem encountered.  Should this event occur a file called
FCC.ERR will be generated and placed in your FCC2 subdirectory. The
user is asked to contact ScanWare and forward a copy of this
FCC.ERR via disk or upload to the BBS.  In this way, updated
program files can be made available for all users.

Reporting Errors or Discrepancies

ScanWare stands behind its products 100%.  Should you experience
any difficulties, PRIOR TO CALLING SCANWARE, PLEASE BE SURE YOU
HAVE READ ALL OF THE DOCUMENTATION (THIS FILE)!

Chapter 6 - Advanced Memory Management

FCC 2.11 has been developed with the best possible runtime
settings. Unfortunately, not every machine runs the same nor are
they configured for optimum performance.  If you have the necessary
resources, you can control many of the more advanced memory
management settings prior to and during execution of FCC 2.11.

The number one improvement that a user can make to speed program
execution is to allocate as much memory as possible.  This includes
both conventional and expanded memory.

If you have insufficient resources to run FCC in protected mode,
the program will allocate your computers expanded memory (if
available) to allow FCC to run in a dynamic overlay mode. 
Depending upon your system configuration, expanded memory will be
allocated up to your machines maximum.  FCC can use memory
configured as expanded memory according to the
Lotus-Intel-Microsoft (LIM) Expanded Memory Specification (EMS)
version 4.0 or higher.

The maximum amount of expanded memory that can be allocated is
limited by the following four factors:

         The amount of expanded memory available
         The CLIPPER environment setting ( //E:nnnn)
         A theoretical maximum of 32MB
         The amount of conventional memory available

You should be aware that a certain amount of conventional memory
must be used to contain management tables for the virtual memory
system; the more total memory (both conventional and expanded), the
more taken up by this control information.  The amount of expanded
memory used may be less than the amount available if there is
insufficient conventional memory to hold the tables.

To find out exactly how much expanded memory (if any) has been
allocated on your machine, you can start FCC with the //INFO
command line switch.  This will return a display which provides
(among other things) the total EMM setting for that session.  A
sample of the //INFO results could look like the following:

C:\FCC2> FCC //INFO

Clipper (R) 5.2d (Rev. 204) ASCII
DS=615F:0000  DS avail=37KB  OS avail=146KB  EMM avail=2048KB 

FCC Frequency Retrieval System, Version 2.11
Copyright (c) 1993-1994, ScanWare Associates
All rights reserved.

This example identifies the 2,048KB of expanded memory has been
allocated to FCC at startup.

C:\FCC2> FCC //INFO

Clipper (R) 5.2d (Rev. 204) ASCII
DS=01BC:0000  DS avail=37KB  OS avail=1023KB  EMM avail=0KB 

FCC Frequency Retrieval System, Version 2.11
Copyright (c) 1993-1994, ScanWare Associates
All rights reserved.

This particular example shows that FCC has started in protected
mode (note the OS avail=1023KB...That's over 1MB of conventional
memory after loading!!!)

To change the amount of expanded memory at run time, start FCC with
the command line switch:

FCC //E:nnnn  (where nnnn is the maximum amount of expanded memory
you wish to allocate)

For example, FCC //E:1024 would only allocate 1,024KB of expanded
memory while FCC //E:0000 could be used to allocate no expanded
memory.  As noted above, the advantage of reducing the amount of
expanded memory used is to save conventional memory usage.  As
noted above, you may allocate up to a theoretical maximum of 32MB. 
NOTE: It is NOT recommended that you change this setting unless you
are having problems.  Reducing EMM usage could potentially result
in a performance degradation.  Additionally, unpredictable results
may occur if all available expanded memory is allocated at startup. 
NOTE:  You may find that starting FCC with the //E: command line
setting makes no difference to the results reported by the //INFO
command.  If //INFO is reporting OS available of 1023 and EMM
available of 0, then your system has sufficient expanded memory to
run in dual mode and will not require any changes to the EMM
setting.  If this is the case, smile!  You have a well set up
system!

Techno-Babble

Version 2.11 of the FCC Frequency Retrieval System was written and
compiled in CA-Clipper, Version 5.2d and linked using the Blinker
linker, Version 3.01 in Dual mode (see below).  Extensive use is
made of the Grumpfish Library, Version 4.03, without which this
program would never have been possible.  All programming was done
on a 486DX2-66 machine, running DOS 6.20.  The text editor of
choice for FCC (and all ScanWare projects) is The SemWare Editor
(TSE) by SemWare Corporation.  The documentation for FCC was
written using WordPerfect 6.0a for Windows.

Testing for FCC 2.11 was done on 3 different platforms.  As noted
above, all development and testing was performed on a 486-66.  The
primary system testing was done on 386-33 and 286-8 machines.  In
all cases, each machine handled and processed the data/program with
flying colors.  While it should be noted that the performance on
the 286-8 machine was less than ideal, it ran all functions without
any problems.  ScanWare cannot guarantee the suitability of FCC
when running on any machine less than a 286.  Unfortunately, we did
not have access to a 8088 machine with which to test FCC.  Be
advised that FCC 2.11 does not run on these computers.

Dual Mode

Blinker is an award-winning DOS dynamic overlay linker, a 286 DOS
extender and a Windows linker.  Blinker is the best way to create
a single program which will automatically run in both real and
protected mode DOS.  When run in protected mode, FCC will instantly
have access to up to 16MB of available memory for both code and
data.  Protected mode allows FCC to run in many environments,
including:

         DPMI, for running in a DOS box of Windows and OS/2
         VCPI, for running under memory managers which do not
          provide DPMI
         XMS, for simple 286 memory managers

When run in protected mode, FCC is loaded into extended memory and
run from there, providing the rest of available memory and 64MB of
virtual memory to FCC for its data.  This means that code swapping
is eliminated, and data swapping is virtually non-existent provided
sufficient extended memory is available.

FCC, upon startup, will detect whether there are enough system
resources to run in protected mode.  If there are insufficient
resources, then FCC will run as a normal dynamically overlaid
program.

The complete FCC System currently consists of over 10,000 lines of
code in all of the program modules.  (This does not include the
thousands and thousands of lines of code contained in the Grumpfish 
Library).  The memory requirements reported by Clipper at the end
of compilation are about 326K while the entire compiled EXE stands
at about 700K.

ScanWare Associates warrants that the physical diskette(s) (meaning
the diskette(s) itself, not the Software) on which the Software is
provided will be free from defects in material and workmanship
under normal use for a period of thirty (30) days from the date you
received delivery.

Except as expressly set forth above, ScanWare Associates makes no
other warranties of any kind, and ScanWare Associates hereby
disclaims all other warranties, both express and implied, including
but not limited to warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular use or purpose, and any implied warranty arising from
course of performance.  The software provided on the diskette(s)
and the documentation are provided "as is" without further warranty
of any kind.

ScanWare Associates does not warrant that the Software or the
Documentation will meet your requirements, that the operation of
the Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or that all
defects in the Software and/or Documentation will be corrected. You
assume sole responsibility for the selection of the Software and

Documentation to achieve your desired results and for the
installation and use of the Software and Documentation.  Should the
Software prove defective, repair or replacement will be made by
ScanWare Associates.  The cost of all necessary servicing, repair,
or correction will be borne by the purchaser and not by ScanWare
Associates.

If the disclaimer of implied warranties is not permitted by
applicable law, then any warranties implied by law, including, but
not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose, are hereby limited in duration to thirty (30)
days from the date you received delivery.

Some states do not allow limitations on the duration of implied
warranties, so the above limitations may not apply to you.  This
limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have
other rights, which vary from state to state.

In no event shall ScanWare Associates or its suppliers be liable
for any damages whatsoever, including, without limitations, damages
for loss of profits, business interruption, loss of data or
information, pecuniary loss, or other indirect, special,
consequential, or incidental damages, arising out of the use or
inability to use this Software and/or Documentation, however caused
and on any theory of liability, even if ScanWare Associates has
been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall
ScanWare Associates liability, however founded, exceed the price
paid by you for the Software and Documentation.  Some states do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or
incidental damages and other limitations or exclusions may apply. 
Consult your own state laws.

By your initial use of this program you acknowledge that you have
read this agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its
terms and conditions.  Furthermore, you agree that this is the
complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and
ScanWare Associates and that this agreement supersedes all prior
agreements, whether verbal or written, and any other communications
relating to the subject matter of this agreement. This agreement
may not be modified by any party except ScanWare Associates.

6.   Shareware License

You are granted a license to distribute the SHAREWARE version of
the Software to anyone to whom you see fit.  The Software may not
be "resold" by SHAREWARE distributors for a cost exceeding $5.00.
The SHAREWARE distributor should have a notice prominently
displayed in their advertisement that the programs they distribute
are Copyrighted by others and by paying the SHAREWARE distributor

a fee to purchase the disk does not constitute the registration of
the Software.

7.   Restrictions

If you use the Software to produce electronic files of any format
or in any other form, you must include in plain text within said
file the following copyright text:

     All rights reserved.

Further, under no circumstances are you authorized to use the
Software to generate any documents or files that are not for
personal use, or to produce any files or information of any format,
by any means, in any form or language for reproduction, publication
or transmission.  You may not sell or give away any documents or
information to anyone for any reason, and you may not provide any
information to anyone which may be contained within the FCC
Frequency Retrieval System without the prior written consent of
ScanWare Associates.

If you receive written authorization to produce such files as
described above, and if you print for publication, reproduction or
transmission any data derived from the FCC Frequency Retrieval
System, you must also include in plain text within said publication
an acknowledgement that the information contained therein was

Addendum

Note from Matt Amis

I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Greg Lief
of Grumpfish Inc. of Salem Oregon for his Clipper Library. Without
this tool, programming this project would have been impossible.
Thanks Greg, I owe you one.

Note from Gene McAvoy

ScanWare is very grateful to Chuck Pergrin of the PerCon
Corporation for his many hours of work in producing the FCC Master
Frequency List data.  Without this data there would be no FCC FRS. 
Thank you Chuck!
