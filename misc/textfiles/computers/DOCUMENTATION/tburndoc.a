1.0.     INTRODUCTION

1.1.      Program Design

          TBURN is designed to provide an engineer with an easy to
          use tool for analyzing the combustion of gaseous, liquid
          or solid fuels.  TBURN was designed for the occasional
          user, with simple input screens and numerous prompts and
          help windows.  My goal was to be able to give this
          program to another engineer, without a manual, and have
          that person able to solve a combustion problem without
          much difficulty or assistance.

1.2.      Computer System Requirements

          In order to run TBURN smoothly, your computer system must
          conform to the following requirements:

          *    IBM PC, XT, AT OR 100% compatible with BIOS and DOS
               functions which are MS-DOS compatible, as defined
               in the IBM Technical Reference Manual.

          *    256 K of free RAM memory

          *    MS-DOS or PC-DOS version 2.1 or later

          *    An Epson FX dot matrix printer or equivalent (Not
               required for calculations, only for printing reports
               properly).

1.3.      Demonstration Version

          The 'Demonstration Version' of TBURN allows full access
          to all of the functions of TBURN so that the un-licensed
          user can examine and evaluate the program.  However, some
          values involved in the calculations are fixed by the
          program, including the following:

                    Stack Temperature = 600 [F]
                    Excess Air = 40%

          These fixed values will override any user inputted values
          in these fields and the calculated results will reflect
          these fixed values.

          A Licensed copy of TBURN, and all the other software
          products from Tees Engineering, can be obtained from Tees
          Engineering and its marketing agents.

1.4.      Making a Backup Copy of Your Diskette

          To protect you against the unlikely event that your
          original TBURN diskette is lost or destroyed, you should
          make a backup copy.  This backup diskette will be your
          "Working Copy".  That is, once this step is completed,
          your original TBURN diskette should be stored in a safe
          place.  For everyday use, you will use your "Working
          Copy".  This step should be done before using TBURN.

1.4.1.    Single Diskette System

          If you have a single diskette system (only one floppy
          diskette drive and no fixed disk drive), follow the
          instructions below to make a backup copy of your original
          TBURN diskette.  You will need your DOS diskette, one
          blank diskette, and your original TBURN program disk.

          o    Place a write-protect tab on the notch of your DOS
               diskette, and also one on the notch of your TBURN
               program diskette.

          o    Insert the DOS diskette in the drive and turn on
               your computer.

          o    Press [ENTER] until you see the "A" prompt, i.e. 
               A>  

          o    Type:     FORMAT B:/S   , and then press [ENTER].

          o    When the screen prompts you to insert a new diskette
               for Drive B, remove the DOS diskette from the drive
               and place the blank diskette in the drive.  Press
               [ENTER].

               Note:  This last two step will format and load the
               "System" files on the blank diskette.

          o    When the computer prompts you "Format Another
               Diskette (Y/N)?", press "N" for No.

          o    Insert the TBURN diskette into the disk drive and
               type:     COPY A:*.* B:   , and then press [ENTER].

          o    You will then be prompted to insert the "Source"
               diskette into the drive and press [ENTER].  In this
               case, the "Source" diskette is your TBURN diskette. 
               The system will read the files on the TBURN diskette
               into memory.  

          o    You will then be prompted to insert the "Target"
               diskette into the drive and press [ENTER].  The
               blank diskette is the "Target" diskette.  The system
               will write the TBURN files from memory onto the
               blank diskette.

               Note:  You may be asked to repeat the last two steps
               several times depending on the amount of memory in
               your computer.

          o    When the "A" prompt returns to the screen, the
               backup process is complete.  Remove the original
               TBURN diskette from the computer and store it in a
               safe place.  The other diskette now has copies of
               all of the TBURN files and is ready to be used as
               your "Working Copy".

1.4.2.    Two Diskette System

          If you have a two diskette system, follow the
          instructions below to make a backup copy of your original
          TBURN diskette.  You will need your DOS diskette, one
          blank diskette, and your original TBURN program disk.

          o    Place a write-protect tab on the notch of your DOS
               diskette, and also one on the notch of your TBURN
               program diskette.

          o    Insert the DOS diskette in Drive A and turn on your
               computer.

          o    Insert the blank diskette in Drive B.

          o    Press [ENTER] until you see the "A" prompt, i.e. 
               A>

          o    Type:     FORMAT B:/S   , and then press [ENTER].

          o    When the computer prompts you "Format Another
               Diskette (Y/N)?", press "N" for No.

          o    Remove the DOS diskette from Drive A.  Insert the
               original TBURN diskette in Drive A.  A blank
               formatted diskette should be in Drive B.

          o    Type:     COPY A:*.* B:   , then press [ENTER].

          o    After the computer finishes copying the files from
               the TBURN diskette to the backup diskette, remove
               the TBURN diskette and store in a safe place.  The
               diskette in Drive B will now be your "Working Copy".

1.4.3.    Fixed Disk System

          If you using a computer with a fixed disk, often also
          refereed to as a "hard disk", you may want to transfer
          TBURN onto your fixed disk.  Follow the instructions
          below to copy the TBURN files onto the fixed disk. 

          o    Place a write-protect tab on the notch of your TBURN
               program diskette.

          o    Boot your computer from the fixed disk.  

          o    Create a sub-directory for TBURN on your fixed disk
               by typing:   MD\TBURN   , and press [ENTER].

          o    Change directories to the TBURN sub-directory by
               typing:  CD\TBURN   , and press [ENTER].

          o    Insert the TBURN original program disk in Drive A.

          o    Copy the files from the diskette to your fixed disk
               drive by typing:    COPY A:*.*   , then press
               [ENTER].

          o    After the computer finishes copying the files from
               the TBURN diskette to the fixed disk, remove the
               TBURN diskette and store in a safe place.  

2.0.     USING TBURN

2.1.      Introduction

          TBURN is an engineering application written using the
          MS-DOS operating system.  Therefore, you must start or
          "boot" your computer using MS- or PC-DOS 2.1 or later in
          order to run TBURN.

          To start TBURN, insert the program disk in any drive and
          make that drive the default drive.  For example, if you
          insert the program disk in Drive A, type A: and press
          [ENTER].  This will make Drive A the default drive and
          the "A:>" prompt should be displayed on your screen. 
          TBURN can also be copied to a fixed disk or other storage
          device.  Use the DOS change directory, CD, command to
          move to the directory containing TBURN.

          From the DOS prompt of the drive or fixed disk directory
          containing TBURN, simply type "TBURN" and press [ENTER]
          to start TBURN.  The batch file TBURN.BAT will call the
          compiled executable file for TBURN.

2.1.1.    General Comments
     
          TBURN is designed so that data entry should be very
          obvious and simple.  Whenever input is required, TBURN
          will prompt you with an input window.  

          TBURN provides help screens with typical values and other
          helpful information for every input field.  Most
          information requested by TBURN also has a default value.

          Also, at any time you can press the "Help" key, [F1],
          and TBURN will display context sensitive help.


2.1.2.    "Tees-Standard" User Interface

          One feature of TBURN is the consistent screen layout. 
          All Tees Engineering software have a similar screen
          layout, where possible.  TBURN includes this "Tees-
          Standard" user interface, which allows for simple full-
          screen editing of input data, and context-sensitive help
          windows which are the trademark of Tees Engineering
          software.  This feature is intended to make the program
          more "Engineer-Friendly" and to facilitate learning.

          All input screens are divided into three areas.  The top
          four lines comprise the Title Bar, the left side of the
          remaining screen is reserved for input fields, and the
          right side of the remaining screen is reserved for help
          windows and additional information.  A typical input
          screen layout is as follows:

2.1.3.    Movement Inside an Input Screen

          All input screens allow full-screen entry and editing of
          all of the input fields in that screen.  Use the [Up-
          Arrow], [Down-Arrow] and [Enter] keys to move between
          the input fields.  When you get to the bottom input
          field, pressing [Down-Arrow] again will reposition you
          at the top input field.  The converse is also true. 
          After you have entered all of the information in an input
          screen and are satisfied that it is correct, press the
          escape, [ESC], key to proceed to the next input screen
          or on to a results screen.  

2.1.4.   Function Keys

          TBURN defines four of the function keys; [F1], [F4],
          [F7], and [F10].

          o    Pressing [F1] displays a context sensitive help
               window.

          o    Pressing [F4] displays a window with information
               about Tees Engineering.

          o    Press [F10] to exit the program and return to DOS.

          From the Main Menu, [F2] and [F3] are activating allowing
          the users to add and delete gases from the fuel gas
          properties database.
2.2.     TBURN Main Menu

          The Main Menu of TBURN has nine (9) choices:

          o    [F]ired Heater Analysis 
          o    [G]as Fuel Combustion 
          o    [L]iquid/Solid Fuel Combustion
          o    [I]nput Print
          o    [V]iew Results on Screen 
          o    [P]rint Results 
          o    [S]tore Data File 
          o    [R]etrieve Data File 
          o    [Q]uit Program

          Use the [Up Arrow], [Down Arrow] to position the
          highlight bar over the menu choice that you what to
          execute and press [ENTER].  You can also press the key
          of the first letter of the choice description to select
          that menu item.



















2.2.1.   Fired Heater Analysis

          Choosing [Fired Heater Analysis] from the "Main Menu"
          will initiates a sequence of menus, input screens and
          results screens to analysis a fired heater. 

          Immediately when you press the [F] key or [ENTER] when
          the highlight bar is over the [Fired Heater Analysis]
          menu choice in the "Main Menu", a two-item overlay menu
          will appear where you choose between [Gaseous Fuel] and
          [Solid/Liquid Fuel].  This tells TBURN which fuel input
          screen to display.

          After you have chosen which state fuel you are going to
          use, the [Fired Heater Analysis Menu] will be displayed; 
          See Section 2.3. for more information.  This menu is
          where you chose which type of analysis you want to
          perform.

          TBURN will then proceed to a fuel input screen, either
          "Fuel Gas Composition Input" or "Liquid/Solid Fuel Data
          Input".  The sequence continues to the "Combustion Gas
          (Air) Data Input" screen, and then to the "Fired Heater
          Data Input" screen.  Each of these screens is explained
          more fully in the following sections.

          After TBURN has all the information it needs to perform
          the required calculations, it will display the results
          of those calculations in the following sequence of
          results screens:

               o    Fuel Properties
               o    Combustion Gas (Air) Properties
               o    Flue Gas Properties
               o    Fired Heater Results

2.2.2.    Gas Fuel Combustion

          This menu selection is actually a sub-set of the [Fired
          Heater Analysis] selection.  TBURN will prompt you for
          information about the fuel and combustion gas (air) using
          a series of input screens, and will then display the
          stoichiometry results for the combustion of that fuel and
          air mixture.

2.2.3.    Liquid/Solid Fuel Combustion

          Like Gas Fuel Combustion, Liquid/Solid Fuel Combustion
          will prompt you for information about the fuel and
          combustion gas and will then display the corresponding
          results.  The only difference is that the fuel input
          screen for liquid and solid fuels is based on the
          ultimate weight analysis of the fuel.

2.2.4.    Input Print

          Choosing "Input Print" will send the input information
          and data which you have entered or to which TBURN has
          defaulted to a printer attached to your computer.  TBURN
          uses Epson FX standard control codes.  Other printers
          will also print the information, but the printout
          formatting may not be as desired.

          Pressing this key without a printer attached to your
          computer may cause an Error Window to appear.  Pressing
          any key to clear the error window should clear the error.

2.2.5.    View Results on Screen

          Selecting [View Results on Screen] from the "Main Menu"
          will cause the "Results Menu" to appear.  This menu
          allows you to pick which results you want to have
          displayed on the screen.  See Section 2.9.2, "Results
          Menu" for more information.

2.2.6.    Print Results

          Selecting [Print Results] from the "Main Menu" will cause
          the "Print Results Menu" to appear.  Use this menu will
          allow you to direct any or all of the results of the
          combustion and/or fired heater analysis to a printer. 
          See Section 2.9.3., "Print Results Menu for more
          information.


2.2.7.    Store Data File

          This selection will prompt you for the name of a file in
          which to save the input information and data.  This
          information can be then retrieve later.  This facility
          is very useful if common fuel compositions or heaters
          are analyzed repeatedly.

2.2.8.    Retrieve Data File

          This selection will prompt you for the name of an
          existing data file.  TBURN will retrieve the from the
          file and input this information in the input fields.

          The current version of TBURN only searches the default
          drive for the inputted file name.  If TBURN cannot find
          the file, an Error Window will appear.  Pressing any key
          should remove the error message.  Future versions of
          TBURN will allow path definitions and will display a list
          of the available files.

2.2.9.    Quit Program

          This selection will terminate the program and return you
          to the operating system.



2.3.     Heater Analysis Menu

          The "Heater Analysis Menu" allow you to choice what type
          of heater analysis you want to perform.  The following
          choices are included in this menu.

               o    Heater Efficiency Based on Stack Temperature
               o    Excess Air Based on Fuel and Air Flow
               o    Fuel Flow with Given Air Flow and Excess Air
                    Percent
               o    Air Flow Required
               o    [Future Feature]
               o    Return to Main Menu

          Each of these menu choices is discussed in more detail
          in the following sections.



















2.3.1.   Heater Efficiency Based on Stack Temperature

          TBURN calculates the heater efficiency, based on the
          combustion stoichiometry calculations and the fuel,
          combustion gas (air) and flue gas composition and
          temperatures.

          The flue gas composition is determined by combustion
          stoichiometry analysis based on the fuel and combustion
          gas (air) composition.  The flue gas composition is in
          units of [lb/lb/fuel] or [SCFM/SCFM fuel].  

          TBURN calculates the specific heat of the flue gas
          components using empirically based algorithms and the
          stack temperature.  These values are then used to
          determine the heat loss from the heater with the flue
          gases.

          
2.3.2.    Excess Air Based on Fuel and Air Flow

          TBURN calculates the required air flow for the given fuel
          and air composition.  The program then compares the
          required air flow with the given air flow and determines
          the excess air flow provided.


2.3.3.    Fuel Flow with Given Air Flow and Excess Air Percent

          TBURN determines the fuel flow required to burn with the
          given air flow and still maintain a given amount of
          excess air.  

2.3.4.    Air Flow Required

          TBURN calculates the required air flow for the given fuel
          and air composition.  Based on the amount of fuel
          provided and the given excess air requirement, TBURN
          determines the necessary air flow.






2.3.5.    [Future Feature]

          This menu choice has been left empty to accommodate a
          future feature that is already in development.  Licensed
          users of TBURN will be advised when this feature is
          available and will be allowed to upgrade.

          Users may also request the development of additional
          features for future releases of TBURN.  Please contact
          Tees Engineering if you have a suggestion.

2.3.6.    Return to Main Menu

          Choosing this option will return you to the Main Menu. 
          Pressing [ESC] will achieve the same result.

2.4.     Fuel Gas Composition Input

          Choosing [Fired Heater Analysis] or [Gas Fuel Combustion]
          from the "Main Menu" will bring up an input screen for
          entering the composition of the fuel gas.  TBURN has a
          database of twenty-one component gases, including:
          methane, ethane, propane, n-butane, i-butane, n-pentane,
          i-pentane, hexane, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon
          monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapor, air, hydrogen
          sulfide, sulfur dioxide, ethylene, propylene, benzene and
          ammonia.

          Use the cursor movement keys [Up-Arrow] and [Down-Arrow],
          or [Enter] to move to each component gas, and enter the
          percent volume (mole percent can be used) of each
          component.  When all required components have been
          entered, press [ESC] to leave this screen.


















         If the total percentage of the gas components does not
          equal 100%, TBURN will prompt you to reenter the input
          data or TBURN will normalize the data to obtain 100%. 
          Also, if you do not enter any components, TBURN will
          default to the following typical natural gas composition.

               Component           Vol %
               Methane             83.19
               Ethane               8.48
               Propane              4.37
               n-Butane             0.76
               i-Butane             1.68
               i-Pentane            0.57
               n-Pentane            0.32
               Hexane               0.63

2.5.     Liquid/Solid Fuel Data Input 
 
          The "Liquid/Solid Fuel Data Input" screen is designed to
          input the weight percent composition and other
          information about a liquid or solid fuel.  The input
          screen prompts the user for the following information as
          shown below:




















          Again, move between the input screens using the [Up-
          Arrow], [Down-Arrow] and [Enter] keys.  When your input
          data is complete, press [ESC] to leave this input screen.

          All of the data fields have default values.  If you don't
          know a piece of information, allow TBURN to default to
          a typical value.  The default solid fuel is a typical
          Pittsburgh coal.
2.6.     Combustion Gas (Air) Data Input

          The "Combustion Gas (Air) Data Input" screen prompts the
          user for information about the combustion gas or air that
          is used for combustion.  TBURN defaults to "standard
          combustion air" as defined by the American Boiler
          Manufacturer's Association (ABMA); i.e.  air with a
          composition of 79.01 volume percent Nitrogen (inerts are
          included in the nitrogen percentage) and 20.99 volume %
          Oxygen, with a dry bulb temperature of 80 [F] and
          relative humidity of 60% (0.013 lbs. water per lb. air).


















2.7.     Fired Heater Data Input

          The "Fired Heater Data Input" screen is used to input
          the required and optional information about the fired
          heater.  This screen varies depending on the type of
          analysis requested from the "Fired Heater Analysis Menu".

          The following is a summary of the required information
          for each of the heater analysis choices:

          o    Heater Efficiency Based on Stack Temperature
               o    Stack Temperature [F], default = 600 [F]
               o    Excess Air [%], default = 20%

          o    Excess Air Based on Fuel and Air Flow
               o    Fuel Flow, in [SCFM] for gaseous fuels
                               in [lb/hr] for liquid/solid fuels
               o    Air Flow [SCFM]

          o    Fuel Flow with Given Air Flow and Excess Air Percent
               o    Air Flow, in [SCFM, [ACFM] or [lb/hr]
               o    Excess Air [%], default = 20%

          o    Air Flow Required
               o    Fuel Flow, in [SCFM], [ACFM] or [lb/hr]
               
          Some of the optional information that you can also enter
          if that information is known are listed below:

               Heat Liberated [MMBTU/hr], default = 1 [MMBTU/hr]
               Heat Absorbed [MMBTU/hr]
               Heater Efficiency, HHV [%], default = 85%
               Air (Combustion Gas) Flow, default = 2000 [SCFM]

          call me and explain the problem.
