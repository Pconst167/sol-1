                             WHAT IS DOORWAY?

     Doorway is a program which allows almost any program to be run as 
     a  door  and bestows the ability to remotely control  a  computer 
     over  a modem.  Bulletin boards can utilize DOORWAY to  transform 
     normal  programs  into "DOORS", and anyone can use DOORWAY  as  a 
     remote utility.  As a remote utility,  DOORWAY will allow you  to 
     control a distant computer via modem, as if you were there.  This 
     has many benefits over CTTY, as will be discussed later.

     DOORWAY  will  redirect all programs on the host,  with  the  one 
     exception  of programs which use bit-mapped graphics. DOORWAY  is 
     NOT a CTTY function.  

     DOORWAY   does  a  shell  to  the  program  to  run,  or   shells 
     COMMAND.COM,  when used as a remote utility.  It then  translates 
     and redirects all video to the required COM port and all COM port 
     inputs  to  the keyboard buffer.  BIOS interrupts or  screen  RAM 
     comparisons  are  used, so that programs, which DOS  CTTY  cannot 
     redirect,  can still be used.  The Board's keyboard is active  so 
     that the SYSOP (or person on the HOST end) can aid a remote user, 
     and the SYSOP can see what the user is doing.  COMMAND.COM is not 
     loaded by DOORWAY unless specifically instructed to do so by  the 
     HOST  setup; therefore, a user cannot break a program and get  to 
     DOS.   If  the user exits or breaks the program, he  will  simply 
     return to DOORWAY, which will return to the board after resetting 
     all  vectors,  including  any the application  program  may  have 
     changed.  

     Doorway  monitors Carrier Detect, and after displaying a  message 
     that  carrier was lost, returns to the board.  It  also  monitors 
     the  input character string and traps any character(s) the  SYSOP 
     wants  trapped (such as ^C).  It will also abort a  program  with 
     any  character(s) the SYSOP has defined, thus making it  possible 
     to run UNBREAKABLE programs, such as many commercial games.

     The  keyboard time and user's time are monitored, and  if  either 
     expires, DOORWAY will return to the board.  The users's time will 
     be what is computed as being left when PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS is 
     read, unless overridden by a command line switch.

     Keyboard  expiration  time  is changeable,  but defaults  to  255 
     seconds (4 minutes 15 seconds).  The keyboard timeout is measured 
     on  both  the com port and the board's  keyboard,  so  characters 
     entered  at either will reset the timer. The keyboard  timer  can 
     also be reset by the video going out, if desired.

     Full  ANSI  GRAPHICS are supported, but if your  program  doesn't 
     need  it, DOORWAY will work just fine in NON-ANSI mode.   DOORWAY 
     also allows you to send all the extended keyboard codes, such  as 
     the cursor keys and Function keys.

     Please  note that there is no way to trap music or  sound  (other 
     than the bell), thus programs which beep or play music cannot  be 
     overridden, and the sound cannot be redirected to the com port.

QUICK START

  A. For  a quick start on a DROP to DOS, set up your HOST to  call  a 
     batch  file.  The HOST can be almost any  communications  program 
     set  up  in  HOST mode, or a full blown BBS program  set  up  for 
     remote (see its documentation on how to implement host or  remote 
     mode).  Use the following line for the batch file it calls:

     DOORWAY COM1 /S:* /G:ON /V:B^U /M:1000 /B:MSZ /C:DOS

     This line tells DOORWAY to redirect to COM1, not to look for  any 
     user  specific file, turn on graphics (and cursor  control),  use 
     BIOS redirection but allow remote user to switch to DIRECT SCREEN 
     mode with a control "U", allow the user 1000 minutes in DOS,  and 
     to load COMMAND.COM and shell to DOS.

     The  /B:MSZ deals with the bottom line, and for best results, one 
     or more of the letters after the colon may be left out.   Results 
     will  depend on the remote communication package, and whether  it 
     is set up for 24 line (with a status line) mode, or 25 line mode.  
     See the section on the /B: switch for more information.

  B. A  quick  start on a DOOR for a bulletin board system  can  be  a 
     little more complicated.  A good start, however, is one of these:

     For PCBOARD or a system which generates the PCBOARD.SYS file  and 
     does NOT use direct screen writes (writes directly to screen RAM)

     DOORWAY COM1 /S:C:\PCB /B:MZ /P:PROGRAM.EXT
        
     For same as above but uses direct screen writes

     DOORWAY COM1 /S:C:\PCB /B:MZ /V:D /P:PROGRAM.EXT

     For  a  system  which generates DOOR.SYS file and  does  NOT  use 
     direct screen writes

     DOORWAY SYS /B:MZ /P:PROGRAM.EXT

     For  a  system which generates a DOOR.SYS file  and  uses  direct 
     screen writes

     DOORWAY SYS /B:MZ /V:D /P:PROGRAM.EXT

     The  PROGRAM.EXT is the name of the program to put in  a  "DOOR". 
     The  extension MUST be given, and any parameters to be passed  to 
     it must follow the filename on the command line.

     If  the  program requires cursor positioning, and/or  colors  for 
     proper operation a "/G:ON" needs to be added in front of the  /P: 
     switch to force graphics on.

     If  line feeds are being missed in BIOS mode, then either  add  a 
     /L:, use ANSI.COM from PC magazine utilities, or use  ANSIPAT.EXE 
     on your ANSI.SYS.

FILES


     Doorway  will look for up to three files.  the  INITIAL  WELCOME, 
     the  APPLICATION  PROGRAM, and the EXIT MESSAGE.  The  first  and 
     last  are  simply ASCII (or ANSI) files, and the PROGRAM  can  be 
     either  a .COM or .EXE program.  If the INITIAL WELCOME  or  EXIT 
     message has ANSI codes in it, they will be displayed properly  on 
     the HOST and remote ends starting with rev 1.43.

  A. INITIAL WELCOME FILE

     This is simply an ASCII or ANSI file which tells the user what he 
     is  getting ready to run, and possibly tells him he must set  the 
     NUMLOC  key and/or have ANSI graphics installed.  If any line  is 
     started  with a $:, then that line will be printed  (without  the 
     "$:")  and a "Y", "N" or [CR] must be entered before  the  output 
     will  continue.  This allows you to put pauses into the  printing 
     with a:

                 $:ENTER CARRIAGE RETURN TO CONTINUE

     It also allows you to ask the user if he wants to continue, since 
     if the user enters a [CR] or [Y] to the prompt, DOORWAY will  run 
     the  application program, but if he enters an [N],  DOORWAY  will 
     return  to the Board or HOST.  The last entry in the sequence  is 
     the one which determines if the DOOR will continue.

     The initial welcome can be made into a menu.  This is similar  to 
     the monitor function seen on RBBS's.  When DOORWAY is entered, it 
     can be set up to display a menu of programs to select from.   The 
     user enters a number from 0 to 9 or character from A to Z and the 
     program is loaded and run.  When aborted, DOORWAY returns to  the 
     menu,  to let the user select another door if desired.   To  exit 
     the menu, the user enters either a number or letter which is  not 
     defined (such as a "Q").  

     Example:

     The batch file:

        doorway com1 /r:^k /g:on /i:menu

     The following page shows the actual text of the welcome file with 
     the filename of "MENU".












                                  - 5 -



     The WELCOME FILE (MENU):

     Welcome to Data World BBS's games doors.  Select from one of  the 
     following doors.  When through, you will return to this menu.  To 
     end this doors session, type either 'E', 'Q' or selection 5.

        1. Eatumup. A color graphic monster maze game (you need ANSI).
        2. 4inarow. Like Orthello.  Can you beat the computer (ANSI).
        3. Big Rig. Drive a truck across the country (ANSI).
        4. Guessit. Let the computer guess something about you.
        5. The financial menu
        6. Return to board.

        M:Please enter your selection (1-6):

        /p:eatumup.exe
        /t:^C /p:4inarow.exe
        /t:^C /r:^x /p:bigrig.exe
        /g:off /p:guessit.exe
        /i:FMENU

     Please note that the M:...., and switches must start on the  left 
     margin.

     Note  that  you  can  nest menu's now, so  that  one  menu  calls 
     another.   When the program is exited, it will return to the  top 
     level   menu.    For  example,  the   switch   line   containing: 
     /I:FMENU  will  call  up another menu  which  will  be  presented 
     exactly like this one.  See page 26 for an example of FMENU.

     The  M:  means that it is to stop and input a  selection  number.  
     The selection numbers start with 0 and run 0-9, then A-Z.   Since 
     a blank line is between the M: line and the first selection,  the 
     menu  in this case starts with 1. You may need to put a space  on 
     the blank line for correct operation.  The command line sets  the 
     defaults for ALL the programs in the menu. Thus the graphics will 
     be  on,  and  the  ^K will cause an external  abort  in  all  the 
     programs, unless set differently.  4inarow will also trap for ^C, 
     and  Big  Rig will also abort with a ^X.  Guessit  has  the  main 
     command line ANSI ON directive, overridden with the /g:off.

     The m:... may also be used.  The "M:" and "m:" behave differently 
     on  timeouts.   The "M:" will return to the menu if  there  is  a 
     keyboard or user timeout, but the "m:" will return to the  BOARD.  
     Most  likely, if you are reading the PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS  and 
     using the actual user's time, you will want to use the small "m"; 
     however  if you are giving, say, only 10 minutes in a door,  then 
     the capital "M" would be more logical.

     You can also password protect any door, or your drop to DOS  with 
     DOORWAY. Create a welcome file, and on the last line enter:

        P:PASSWORD




                                  - 6 -



     For example:

        Enter the password for exit to dos:
        P:MONGOOSE

     Now,  if this is in the welcome file for your drop to  dos,   the 
     user  will see the first line, and when he enters  the  password, 
     dots will echo.  If the password is entered correctly, the  door, 
     or drop to DOS in this case, will be executed. Otherwise, he will 
     get a message that the password is wrong, and he will be returned 
     to  the  board.   The password may be  either  small  or  capital 
     letters, as DOORWAY doesn't differentiate between them.

  B. APPLICATION PROGRAM

     The  application  program  can  be virtually  any  .COM  or  .EXE 
     program.   Note that the name of the program to be run,  and  the 
     path,  if  not in the same directory as DOORWAY,  must  be  given 
     EXTENSION and ALL.  This is because COMMAND.COM is not loaded for 
     safety  reasons.   Although you could give the  program  name  as 
     "BASIC.EXE  APPLICATION", it is not recommended that you  do  so.  
     If  the user was able to break the interpreted basic program,  or 
     it  were to abort on a critical error, the user would be  in  the 
     basic interpreter.  Then, he could do a shell command which loads 
     COMMAND.COM,  and  be  in  DOS.  After  checking  out  the  BASIC 
     program,  then by all means compile it so a break will return  to 
     DOORWAY, which will in turn return control to the HOST.

  C. EXIT MESSAGE

     This is essentially the same as the INITIAL WELCOME FILE message, 
     but is typed after the application program is run.  The "$:" will 
     wait  after that line is output, just as in the menu  above,  but 
     any [Y] or [N] responses will be ignored by DOORWAY.

INSTALLATION

  A. BATCH FILE

     The batch file for DOORWAY should look something like this:

     DOORWAY COM1 /I:WEL /E:EXM /T:^C /R:^K /G:ON /S:\PCB /P:PROG.EXE

     The  COM  (or  PORT) selection must be  the  first  command  line 
     parameter  (unless  you  are using the DOOR.SYS  file),  and  the 
     program  (or /C:DOS if a drop to dos) must be the last,  but  all 
     the other switches can be in any order.


     DOORWAY > The DOORWAY program

            COM1  >  The com port number.  Can be COM1,  COM1:,  COM2, 
            COM2:,  COM3,  COM3:,  COM4, COM4:,  PORT:AAAA:I,  SYS  or 
            LOCAL. The COM will be overridden and DOORWAY will run  in 
            local  mode  if  the  board was  signed  on  locally,  and 
            PCBOARD.SYS  or  DOOR.SYS is found.  The SYS tells  it  to 
            look for DOORWAY's DOOR.SYS instead of PCBOARD.SYS in  its 
            current  directory.  This  generic  door  interface   file 
            contains  the user's name, port number, time left  and  so 
            forth.  For the actual construction of this SYS file, look 
            at   the  DOORSYS.DOC  file  included  in  this   package.  
            Starting  with  version 2, it will also make  use  of  the 
            "standard"  DOOR.SYS  file created by GAP and  some  other 
            board  packages.   You can use either  of  these  formats, 
            DOORWAY will determine which it is automatically.

            The  additional  COM3  and COM4 support  allows  some  COM 
            ports,  addressed  as  COM3  and COM4,  to  be  used  with 
            DOORWAY.   The  address of the UART base address  must  be 
            found  in  RAM at 40:4 and 40:6, for DOORWAY to  find  the 
            ports.   COM3  will  use interrupt 4  and  COM4  will  use 
            interrupt  3  (same  as COM1 and COM2).   If  your  system 
            doesn't  map  the  addresses of the  COM  ports  into  low 
            memory,  or  the  port uses  other  than  these  interrupt 
            requests,   you  will  have to  give  DOORWAY  the  actual 
            address  and  IRQ of the COM port.  Use  the  PORT:AAAA:I, 
            where AAAA is 4 hexadecimal digits of the base address  of 
            the  port,  and I is a hexadecimal  digit  indicating  the 
            interrupt number.  IE. PORT:03F8:4 is equivalent to COM1.

  C. DETAILED SWITCH DEFINITIONS

     /A: Alarm (bell) is enabled on the Board computer if ON, disabled 
         if  OFF. If left out, the bell will follow the ALARM  setting 
         of the PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS.  Default = OFF. ie.  "/A:ON", 
         will override the PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS setting.

     /B: /B:X,  /B:M, /B:MS, /B:Z.  These codes deal with line  25  of 
         the  display in ANSI mode only.  If the  application  program 
         tries to position the cursor to line 25, some modem programs, 
         such  as QMODEM, ignore the request, since line  25  contains 
         the MODEM's status information.  This can be  disastrous  for 
         some  games which write a status also on this line, since  it 
         will  appear  randomly on the user's screen.  The  /B:X  will 
         simply  not send any characters which are on line 25, and the 
         /B:M  will move the characters to the line above  (line  24).  
         If things go badly when the cursor gets to the bottom of  the 
         screen, try adding /B:M to the command line.  Generally,  you 
         will want this switch for a drop to dos function, if you  are 
         using a com program which will not allow you to eliminate the 
         status  line.  However, if your com program (Such  as  QMODEM 
         4.0)  does  allow  you to eliminate the status  line,  it  is 
         highly recommended to do so, and not use a /B:M.

         Versions  after 1.2 now send a sequence which  will  position 
         the  cursor  at the bottom of the screen for both 24  and  25 
         line modem programs.  For maximum compatibility, it is highly 
         recommended  to  put  this switch in for ALL  door  programs, 
         unless it specifically causes a problem.  Also, since line 24 
         and  25 will be going to line 24 if you do a /B:M,  you  will 
         want to put a /B:MS on a drop to dos and some text  programs.  
         This  tells  DOORWAY to scroll the screen when it  moves  the 
         line from 25 to 24 (BIOS mode only), if the last line written 
         was  line  24.   Otherwise, you may find that  line  24  gets 
         overwritten  once,  when text is being printed.  If  you  are 
         using the /L: and /B:M, this will already be taken care of by 
         the /L: switch.

         A "Z" can also be placed in this sequence.  It tells  DOORWAY 
         to  NOT  write the very last character of  the  bottom  line.  
         Some  programs  will write a character there, quite  often  a 
         space, making the remote's screen scroll, when it  shouldn't.  
         Obviously,  you will be missing a character on the  right  of 
         the screen if you do this, and a character is supposed to  go 
         there.   If the comm program on the remote end  scrolls  when 
         the  bottom  right  character is written,  then  it  will  be 
         absolutely necessary to use the "Z".

     /C: /C:DOS  or  /C:VIA.   The /C: will cause  COMMAND.COM  to  be 
         loaded.   The /C:DOS will then exit to DOS and allow  you  to 
         perform DOS functions over the modem.  Enter "EXIT" to return 
         to the board.  You should make sure you are back in the  same 
         directory  you  dropped to dos in before  exiting.   The  VIA 
         function   will  load  the  program  (or  batch   file)   via 
         COMMAND.COM.  I see no need to do the latter function, but it 
         is  available, if absolutely necessary.  If you load a  batch 
         file and it gets broken, a user could get to your dos.   This 
         is  recommended  for sysop functions ONLY!  If you  load  via 
         command.com,   then path searching will be supported and  the 
         path  and  extension  of  program name  need  not  be  given.  
         Obviously, the DOS function is not for a door at all, but for 
         a  REMOTE drop to DOS function.  You can do a  DOORWAY  /G:ON 
         /C:DOS,  either  in a high security door, or  in  the  REMOTE 
         batch file for remote drops to dos.


     /D: Disable  Disk  writes.  This switch will  intercept  all  DOS 
         calls  and not allow disk writes to take place.  This can  be 
         handy  for a program like a game which insists on  writing  a 
         score file.  It may cause problems for programs which require 
         writing to disk to run.

     /E: Name of the EXIT MESSAGE file. No message if left out.








                                  - 10 -



     /F: Fast.  Functional only if Graphics is 'ON' and in  non-direct 
         screen  mode.   Some programs move the cursor  all  over  the 
         place between characters written, (Quick Basic compiler tends 
         to  do  this).   Each  new  locate  of  the  cursor  normally 
         generates an 8 character ANSI sequence to send out the modem.  
         For  some  games, this unnecessarily slows down  the  action.  
         The  /F: will not send ANY ANSI sequences on a cursor  locate 
         until  a  character is ready to be written.   However,  since 
         cursor  relocates  are not done until a character  is  to  be 
         written,  this  gives  the strange effect  of  not  seeing  a 
         Carriage  Return have any effect until a printable  character 
         is  sent  to the modem.  It also has the  strange  effect  of 
         having the cursor one right of where you would expect, if you 
         enter backspaces over something.

     /G: ANSI  GRAPHICs enabled if ON, disabled if OFF.  If left  out, 
         it will be as defined in the PCBOARD.SYS file. Default is ON.

     /H: Halt  shells  to DOS.  You may want to put a program  into  a 
         door  which allows the user to shell to dos (such  as  LIST).  
         This  switch will prevent the program from doing a  shell  to 
         DOS.   Since a program may do a shell in a non-standard  way, 
         be sure to verify this is operational with any program before 
         making  it available to general users.  If the alarm is  "on" 
         DOORWAY will beep the HOST if anyone tries to shell DOS.

     /I: Name of the WELCOME MESSAGE file. No message if left out.

     /J: NON-IBM compatible BIOS.  This may have to be used if a CLONE 
         BIOS which is not really IBM compatible is in the host, or an 
         EGA/VGA  BOARD  installs a NON-COMPATIBLE BIOS.  If  you  are 
         missing  CRLF's  in  NON-DIRECT mode, try this  switch.   Not 
         active in DIRECT WRITE MODE.

     /K: KEYBOARD TIMEOUT TIMER.  The /K: will accept a number between 
         0  and 255 to define how long, after the last  character  was 
         received  from the remote or local keyboard, to  wait  before 
         terminating the door and returning to the board.  The /K:0 is 
         a special case which will override keyboard timeouts totally, 
         (recommended for drop to dos).  Also, an operand of "V"  will 
         reset the keyboard timer on each character which is sent  out 
         the port.  This is useful if you have a door which sends  out 
         10 minutes of text with no keyboard input required.  The user 
         would  otherwise  be  kicked out of the door  after  about  4 
         minutes, since he hadn't entered anything.  Do not use a /K:V 
         on  something  like  eatumup  though,  since  the  continuous 
         movement  of the monsters will keep the keyboard from  timing 
         out.  A /K:100V will give a 100 second timeout, and reset the 
         timer on video.

     /L: Add line feeds when cursor is positioned at the bottom of the 
         screen. Various ANSI.SYS's handle the scroll differently when 
         they get to the bottom of the screen.  Some do not do a  BIOS 
         scroll,  but  do  the scroll directly without  doing  a  BIOS 
         interrupt.  Thus, if you do a DIR in DOS, it will work  until 
         you get to the bottom of the screen; then, all further  lines 
         will  overwrite the bottom line.  The /L: will check for  the 
         cursor  being addressed at the start of the bottom  line  and 
         add  a  Carriage  Return, if it is there.   If  you  have  an 
         ANSI.SYS  which does the BIOS call, you will get double  line 
         feeds if you add this switch.  Another way of fixing this  is 
         to use a different ANSI.SYS, or try the ANSIPAT patch on your 
         ANSI.SYS.  It should work on most MSDOS's.  It is recommended 
         to  use the ANSIPAT, if it will work, and leave  this  switch 
         out.  ANSI.COM from PC Magazine is a very good alternative.

         It is not necessary to use this switch in direct screen mode.

     /M: Maximum  door  time  allowed.  This  will  override the  time 
         computed  from  the PCBOARD.SYS or DOOR.SYS file.  It  is  in 
         minutes and has a maximum value of 32767 minutes.  Default is 
         10  minutes.  Negative values will cause an immediate  abort.  
         NOTE  - This is functional on registered versions ONLY!   The 
         demo version will always default to 10 minutes.

     /N: NETWORK.  If the /N: switch is set, all files will be  opened 
         network  compatible.   Both  the initial  welcome,  and  exit 
         messages will be opened share compatible, and if the  program 
         being  shelled  opens a file, DOORWAY will  change  its  open 
         command to a share compatible "Allow read - deny write"  open 
         command.   Note that the PCBOARD.SYS/DOOR.SYS file is  closed 
         immediately after reading it, so there is no longer a problem 
         accessing  these  from  the  program  being  shelled.    Some 
         COMMAND.COM's have a problem with this, so if you  experience 
         lock-up's on drop to DOS, try eliminating this switch.

     /O: Override the  DOORWAY title screen.  This can  ONLY  be  done 
         after  registering  your copy of DOORWAY.  A /O:T  will  also 
         eliminate  the  delays  associated with  the  opening  screen 
         (recommended for drop to dos).  See REGISTRATION below.

     /P: The  program name with the extension and path if not  in  the 
         default  directory.   This  MUST be the last  switch  on  the 
         command  line.  Anything following the program name  will  be 
         passed  to the program as a command line parameter  for  that 
         program.  This is not used for a /C:DOS switch.

     /Q: This switch tells DOORWAY that the program being shelled is a 
         Quick  Basic v. 4 or later program.  Doorway  will  intercept 
         the  DOS calls and tell the program that its output is to  be 
         redirected. Without this switch, these programs will not send 
         characters out the com port, since they will do direct screen 
         writes.   If a program will not send characters out  the  com 
         port under DOORWAY, but can be redirected by CTTY, Gateway or 
         the ">" symbol, then this switch should make DOORWAY redirect 
         it as well.  Note that a program expecting redirected  output 
         may not send things like colors, and cursor relocations.   Do 
         not use this switch with a drop to dos, as COMMAND.COM  seems 
         to have real problems with it.  Starting with DOORWAY version 
         2.0,  we  support  direct screen writes.   You  may  want  to 
         experiment with each program and determine if performance  is 
         better in direct screen write mode, or with this switch.

     /R: RETURN.   Each of these defines one character with  which  to 
         abort the program.  The character, with which to abort,  will 
         be  the control equivalent if preceded by a ^, such as a  ^C, 
         for  an ASCII 3.  If the user enters the  control  character, 
         the  sysop will see "EXTERNAL USER ABORT" displayed.  If  the 
         Sysop  enters the return character, then the user  and  Sysop 
         will  receive a message which says, "THE SYSOP HAS  REQUESTED 
         YOU TO RETURN TO THE BOARD", and the program will be aborted.

     /S: Where  to look for PCBOARD.SYS. ie. \PCB\.  Doorway can  tell 
         if  the PCBOARD.SYS is version 11-12 or version 14, and  will 
         read and interpret each properly without being told. If  left 
         out, then it will look in the same directory that DOORWAY  is 
         in.   If not found, then the Graphics, Alarm, User  time  and 
         User name settings will default to their "DEFAULT"  settings.  
         Thus,  this  program is compatible with  RBBS,  WILDCAT,  GT, 
         OPUS,  RYBBS, QBBS, FORUM and GENESIS as well. For  those  of 
         you  who  are running other than PCBoard, I have made  it  so 
         that  the search for PCBOARD.SYS can be totally  over-ridden.  
         Simply  enter  an  /s:* on the command line  and  the  delays 
         associated  with looking for PCBOARD.SYS and  displaying  the 
         "not  found"  message  will no longer occur.   Note  that  to 
         reliably run on RBBS, you must set RBBS up to drop to dos and 
         not  shell for doors.  You can also look for a  generic  door 
         file instead of pcboard.sys, by placing a "SYS" where the com 
         port  normally goes in the command line.  Do not use the  /S: 
         parameter with SYS.

     /T: Each  of these defines a character to trap out of the  input. 
         If  there is a ^ in front of the character, it will look  for 
         that  control  character. A ^@ will trap all  extended  codes 
         (See below).

     /V: This  is  the  one you have all been waiting  for!   Go  into 
         direct  screen write mode.  Instead of redirecting  the  BIOS 
         calls  for VIDEO, this will tell DOORWAY to check the  Host's 
         screen  against an image DOORWAY maintains.  When it  sees  a 
         difference, it will send it out the modem. A /V:D will put it 
         in  direct  screen mode, a /V:B (the default)  in  BIOS  call 
         mode.  You can add an additional character to allow switching 
         between  modes,  such  as: /V:D^U will start  out  in  direct 
         screen  mode,  but allow you to toggle between modes  with  a 
         control  U  (on  remote end only).  A screen  redraw  can  be 
         accomplished by switching to BIOS and back to DIRECT.  It  is 
         highly  recommended NOT to use anything other than a 25  line 
         mode  on the com end for this, on a drop to dos. A /B:Z  will 
         be  necessary,  if  your com  program  doesn't  support  mode 
         setting via ANSI.  Otherwise,  the remote screen will  scroll 
         when  the cursor reaches the bottom right of the screen,  and 
         the remote end will get very messed up.
         When  a  large  portion of the screen  has  changed,  DOORWAY 
         checks to see if the screen scrolled, and if it did, sends  a 
         scroll to the remote. DOORWAY will check for up to 5 scrolls.  
         If  the  HOST gets more than 5 scrolls ahead of  the  remote, 
         then  DOORWAY  will  start rewriting  the  screen.   If  this 
         happens, you may want to enter a ^S, and let the remote catch 
         up  with  the HOST, so they can get resynced.  It  is  highly 
         unlikely  this  will be necessary with the  changes  made  in 
         version 2.03 (Enter a ^Q to restart).

         Redirection  of  the  Host's screen  occurs  when  there  are 
         keyboard  or  timer  interrupts.  Thus  the  remote  will  be 
         updated  as quickly as possible when the program  is  waiting 
         for  a keyboard interrupt, and will still redirect,  although 
         more slowly, when not checking keyboard interrupts.

     /W: If you put in the /W: switch, it will pause at the completion 
         of a program.  It will not pause if there is a carrier  loss, 
         or  if  the program was terminated by the  Sysop  (Sysop  has 
         requested that you return to board).

     /X: This will load and use a translation table.  The  translation 
         table  can  be generated and modified by using  the  included 
         XTABLE.EXE  program.  Additional information can be found  in 
         the  translation  table documentation included in  this  ZIP.  
         The translation table allows redefining any and all keys from 
         the remote to the host.  Thus, if a program requires entering 
         an  [F10] to exit, you can remap it to say a ^Q (control  Q).  
         Some  programs such as QEDIT use both the character  and  the 
         scan code for proper operation.  Starting with version  2.00, 
         DOORWAY  now supplies scan codes to the HOST's program.   For 
         instance,  entering the ESC key will put QEDIT  into  command 
         mode,  but  entering  a ^[ or ALT 27 will  instead  cause  an 
         escape character (back arrow) to be sent to the text file.  






                                  - 14 -



         Of  course, if an ESC character is received over  the  modem, 
         there is no way to tell which of these 3 methods were used to 
         generate  the  ESCAPE.   DOORWAY has a default  set  of  scan 
         codes, so when it sees an ESC, it tells QEDIT the ESC key was 
         pressed.  If you want it to tell QEDIT that a ^[ was  pushed, 
         then  remap  the ESC or some other key to a  ^[  ESCAPE  with 
         XTABLE.EXE.   Several  other keys  are  handled  differently,  
         most  notably, the two sets of numbers (DOORWAY  defaults  to 
         the ones at the top of the keyboard), and the two "-" and "+" 
         signs (DOORWAY defaults to the white ones).  For  information 
         on XTABLE, see the XTABLE.DOC file.

         If you are running out of room on the command line (DOS  only 
         lets you put 127 characters on a line), you can eliminate the 
         colons  after the switches.  It makes reading the  line  more 
         difficult, so it is not recommended to leave them out  unless 
         you really need the space.

MULTITASKING

     DOORWAY   now   supports   TaskView   and   other   multi-Tasking 
     environments.  You need not even inform DOORWAY about the  Multi-
     tasker.   In some cases, you may be unable to use  direct  screen 
     mode with multi-taskers.

EXTENDED KEYBOARD CODE SUPPORT

     DOORWAY supports all extended character codes! This allows you to 
     send  it  the  Function keys, Cursor  keys,  and  ALT  functions.  
     Undefined codes and the Ctrl PrtSc code are trapped from going to 
     the program, since some undefined codes can crash the system.  If 
     you  want to override all extended codes, then enter a  /T:^@  on 
     the command line, as this will then trap the NULL character.   At 
     this  time,  there  are  several  modem  packages  which  support 
     extended  keyboard codes.  The following table lists those  which 
     claim  to have DOORWAY capability.  The comm programs  either  go 
     into  DOORWAY mode by entering an ALT character, such as ALT  "=" 
     (internal),  or  by loading a DOORWAY  keyboard definition  file.  
     Keyboard  definition files are sometimes included with  the  comm 
     program,  or can be downloaded from most BBS's. If your  favorite 
     modem  program  doesn't  support extended key  codes,  you  might 
     mention this much needed function to your favorite modem software 
     vendor!

     Starting  with version 2.05, DOORWAY also supports  the  enhanced 
     keyboard.  If the com package is capable of sending the  enhanced 
     keys from remote, then doorway will return them to the program on 
     the HOST if an enhanced keyboard call is performed.  Note that if 
     the HOST does not have an enhanced keyboard,  any program on  the 
     HOST  is  highly  unlikely to ask for enhanced  codes,  and  will 
     therefore not get them.  Standard extended codes are encoded as a 
     NULL  followed by the SCAN CODE.  E0 enhanced extended codes  are 
     encoded as "NULL EOH SCANCODE".

DROP TO DOS OR REMOTE CAPABILITY

     Many  people  are now using DOORWAY for a remote drop to  DOS  or 
     remote redirection program.  This can be done with the  following 
     command  line  for either your drop to dos door or  remote  batch 
     file:

        DOORWAY COM1 /i:pword /g:on /a:on /m:100 /v:d^U /s:* /c:dos

     I like to turn the alarm on, so if anyone gets into my dos I will 
     hear  any  beeps.   You  will need to use  a  com  program  which 
     supports 25 line mode. The above also sets ANSI graphics on.  The 
     /m:100  gives me 100 minutes in dos, and the /c:dos tells  it  to 
     drop  to dos.  The /i:pword allows me to check a password  before 
     an  exit to dos is allowed, and may be left out if  desired.  See 
     the discussion on the password in the initial welcome  discussion 
     above.  The  /V:D^U  puts it in direct  screen  write  mode,  for 
     compatibility with virtually all programs I may want to run,  and 
     the  ^U lets me toggle between the modes, for a screen redraw  if 


                                  - 16 -



     nothing else.  You may need a /B:Z, depending on whether your com 
     program  handles the "^[[7l" ansi sequence or not. (If you see  a 
     "^[[?7l"  or  "^[[?7h" tell the author of your com  package.)   A 
     /B:M  will be needed, if you are unable to eliminate  the  status 
     line on the remote end.

     The  reasons  for using DOORWAY for your drop to  dos  are  many.  
     Here are a few of the more obvious ones:

                                           CTTY     GATEWAY    DOORWAY
     Redirects BIOS writes                  no        no         yes

     Monitors user time                     no        no         yes
     Abort on keyboard timeouts             no        no         yes

     Allows you to inhibit disk writes      no        no         yes


     Some  of  the  PCBOARD 12.1 utilities require you  to  do  a  SET 
     PCB=/BIO  to make them do BIOS writes.  I would put this line  in 
     the  batch  file for your drop to dos, just  before  the  DOORWAY 
     line, if you are using a BIOS drop to dos and PCB 12.1.   PCBOARD 
     will remove this from the environment when it is run;  therefore, 
     it  needs  to be set each time you do a drop to dos.   With  this 
     set,   the  PCBSETUP can be run from remote if you  are  using  a 
     modem package which supports the extended key codes.  The cursor, 
     page  up and page down, and function keys will all be handled  as 
     if entered on the board keyboard.  You can move around the pages, 
     and  also enter the ALT F to find a string.  In dos, the F3  will 
     repeat the last command and in EDLIN, you can use the F3, cursor, 
     ins,  and  delete keys, just as you would at the  main  keyboard.  
     The PCB=/BIO is not required for PCBOARD 14.

     You  will  find you can do lots of things which  CTTY  disallows.  
     Try  a  "COPY CON: FILENAME" with CTTY and it will lock  up,  but 
     works fine with DOORWAY.  To exit the COPY CON: enter a ^Z.  Once 
     you get used to a DOORWAY remote drop to dos, you will wonder how 
     you got along without it.

USER ABORTS AND LOST CARRIERS

     If  a user enters one of the characters following the /R: in  the 
     DOORWAY  command  line, then the program will  abort.   "EXTERNAL 
     USER ABORT" will be displayed on the Sysop's screen for a  couple 
     of  seconds.  Note that if the user does an EXTERNAL  ABORT  when 
     the program is in a CRITICAL DOS function, the abort could  crash 
     the  system.  Therefore,  if a critical  DOS  function  is  being 
     performed, the abort will be put off (but remembered) until it is 
     safe to abort.  If the user does an external abort during a  drop 
     to DOS (REMOTE session),  the function or program in process will 
     be  aborted,  and the user will be dropped back to DOS,  and  the 
     message "EXTERNAL ABORT IN DOS" will appear on both ends.

     If  a  carrier  is lost, the program will  abort  and  return  to 
     the HOST program automatically.  The message "CARRIER LOST  >>>>> 
     RETURNING  TO  BOARD"  will flash up on the  HOST's  screen.   If 
     carrier  is  lost during a critical DOS  function,  DOORWAY  will 
     attempt  to abort the program for 255 seconds.  DOORWAY  goes  to 
     great   lengths   to  abort  a  program  which   was   previously 
     unbreakable.   It  will resort to hooking the dos  interrupts  to 
     gain  control,  and  sending the program  carriage  returns,  ESC 
     characters,  and  ^C's.  If unable to break the program  for  255 
     seconds,  then the system will reboot.  The only way I  know  for 
     this  to  happen,  is if there is a critical DOS  error  and  the 
     system is waiting for an input with "RETRY, ABORT,or IGNORE".  If 
     this  happened,  and the user hung up, then the system  would  be 
     hung  until the Sysop noticed it and entered an "A".   Therefore, 
     Doorway  will  reboot  the system, as there is  really  no  other 
     solution.

     Likewise,  if  a carrier is lost while in DOS,  the  system  will 
     abort and the message, "CARRIER LOST --> REBOOTING" will flash up 
     to  the  screen.   The reason for this may  not  be  so  obvious.  
     First,  you don't abort from DOS the same way as from a  program, 
     DOORWAY  would  have  to  fake an "EXIT"  being  entered  at  the 
     keyboard.   Second, Doorway has no way of knowing if you  are  in 
     DOS or running a program from DOS, which would have to be aborted 
     first.

     If a User or keyboard timeout occurs, then DOORWAY will send  the 
     appropriate message and return to PCBoard.  If a keyboard timeout 
     occurs in DOS (/C:DOS), then the bell will be rung,  but it  will 
     not reboot.

REGISTRATION

     This  DOORWAY program is strictly a non-registered  demo-version.  
     The exact terms of this agreement are given fully in APPENDIX  2, 
     but  the following is a "plain english" condensation.  This  non-
     registered  version  may be freely distributed  and  uploaded  to 
     BBS's.   It  can be tested and used for one  month.   After  that 
     date, the program may not be used, unless it is registered.   You 
     may register it several ways.  First, you may fill out the  order 
     blank at the end of this book and send with $30 to:
                         Marshall Dudley

                         Knoxville, Tn. 37922

     Second,  you  may call Data World BBS, and go  into  the  DOORWAY 
     registration  door  (DOOR 18), which will allow you  to  register 
     your  software  on-line in only a couple of  minutes.   You  will 
     receive  your  registration number while you wait.  Be  sure  and 
     have  either your VISA, MASTERCARD, DISCOVER, or AMEX card  handy 
     before  entering  the door.  Please note that using  a  false  or 
     stolen credit card number is a crime. 

     When  you  register, you will receive a Registration  number  for 
     your  copy of DOORWAY.  This number will be valid for your  board 
     for  all future versions of DOORWAY, no matter when or where  you 
     get them.  You will be registered in the DOORS conference on Data 
     World  BBS,  and  given  complete  support  (If  you  don't   get 
     registered, leave a message to the sysop or page him).  Defeating 
     the registration, or distributing a registered version of DOORWAY 
     is  illegal.   Make  sure that any copies  of  DOORWAY  you  make 
     available  for  others  are NON-REGISTERED!   Violators  will  be 
     prosecuted.  If you have any questions or comments, feel free  to 
     contact the home board:

               Data World BBS 615)966-3574

     615)675-4577)

     Nodes 1 and 2 use Hayes 9600 V modems.  Node 3 is 2400/1200 baud.

     Once you have your registration number, go into the  subdirectory 
     that DOORWAY is in and type "DOORWAY REGISTER".  DOORWAY will ask 
     for  your board name.  It must be entered EXACTLY as  registered, 
     including spaces and any punctuation (although capital and  small 
     letters  can  be interchanged) .  Then,  enter  the  registration 
     number  you have gotten, and it will automatically  register  the 
     software to your board.  The operation of DOORWAY will change  as 
     follows when registered:

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

     Q. I have typed DOORWAY LOCAL, but all it does is print a  screen    
        of information and return to DOS.

     A. DOORWAY is not a door itself.  It turns other programs into  a    
        door.  Thus,  unless you are using it for a drop to  dos,  you 
        will need a /P:FILENAME.EXT as the last switch on the  command 
        line.

     Q. I  am  using DOORWAY for my remote drop to dos.  It  seems  to     
        work fine, except when a directory gets to the bottom line  of 
        the  screen,  one of the lines gets overwritten.   Also,  back 
        spaces  do  not  work on the bottom line,  but  become  spaces 
        instead.

     A. You  are using a communication program which places  a  status     
        line on the bottom line of the screen.  Therefore, attempts to     
        address  the  cursor on the bottom line are being  ignored  by 
        your  modem  software.   This is not a  DOORWAY  problem,  but 
        DOORWAY will solve it if you put a /B:MS switch in the command 
        line.

     Q. DOORWAY  used  to work great for my compiled  BASIC  programs.  
        Now it won't send the characters any more.

     A. You have moved from QUICK BASIC 1, 2 or 3 to QUICK BASIC 4, or    
        Turbo  Basic.  The  compilers have quit  using  the  MSDOS/IBM    
        specifications for sending characters to the screen.   Instead 
        of  using  DOS  or BIOS interrupts, they are  writing  to  the 
        screen memory directly.  Thus, it is impossible to redirect by 
        normal  means.  Either include the (Q)uick Basic switch  "/Q:" 
        in  the  command line, compile with a pre-4 version  of  QUICK 
        BASIC, or set up DOORWAY to use the direct screen mode (/V:D).

     Q. I am using DOORWAY for my remote drop to dos also, but when it    
        gets to the bottom of the screen on a DIR listing, I don't get    
        ANY  more  line feeds, and all lines  overwrite  the  previous 
        lines on the bottom.

     A. There  are  several  versions of ANSI.SYS.   Some  are  better     
        behaved  than  others.  Some of them do NOT do a  BIOS  scroll 
        when  they get to the bottom, but instead do a block  move  in 
        video  memory.   DOORWAY has no way of  trapping  this  "blind 
        scroll".   Therefore, DOORWAY can be made to send a line  feed 
        when it appears that a scroll was done.  Just insert a /L:  in 
        the command line to get it to insert extra line feeds.  If you 
        put this switch in and don't need it, you will get double line 
        feeds at the bottom.  A better solution is to try the  ANSIPAT 
        in this ZIP. It should work on most MSDOS's which exhibit this 
        problem.  DOORWAY 1.45 has been made compatible with ANSI.COM, 
        the PC magazine ANSI driver, and is a very good substitution.

     Q. I  can't seem to get DOORWAY to give me more than  10  minutes 
        before it aborts.  It even reboots if I am in DOS.


                                  - 21 -



     A. Either  you  don't have a registered version or  else  DOORWAY 
        cannot  find PCBOARD.SYS, and you have not defined  a  maximum 
        time on the command line with a /M:XXX (where XXX is the  time 
        in minutes).  It is assumed that, if time expired on a user in 
        DOS,  something  is  VERY  wrong,  and  that  he/she  probably 
        shouldn't  be  there.   Therefore,  the  system  will  reboot, 
        hopefully before any harm has been done.

     Q. DOORWAY seems to work fine, but when it is through, the  board 
        doesn't come back up.  

     A. Check  your  Board documentation for how to  implement  doors.  
        For PCBOARD, you need to place the line "BOARD"  (or  whatever 
        you  named the board's batch file) after the "DOORWAY  XXXXXX" 
        line.   This will be different for different board  softwares.  
        See the example .BAT files for guidance.  For RBBS, it is  not 
        recommended to shell to DOORWAY.

     Q. DOORWAY  seems  to  work from the board  end,  but  gives  and 
        receives no response from the modem.

     A. Check  that  you  have defined the correct COM:  port  in  the 
        command line.

     Q. When I run a particular program during my remote drop to  dos, 
        it  seems to hang up when I exit.  If I enter a  character,  I 
        get  a  beep, and everything starts working  again.   What  is 
        happening?

     A. Your  program  is  turning off the com  port  when  it  exits.  
        Doorway now monitors the com lines during timer ticks.  When a 
        character  is entered by the user and not fetched for over  .5 
        second, DOORWAY will reopen the com port and send a beep.

     Q. When  I run DOORWAY, many programs will not send anything  out 
        the  com  port, but user entered characters are  received  ok.  
        What's the problem?

     A. You are using an "ENHANCED" ANSI driver, such as FANSI, NANSI, 
        or ZANSI. These do direct screen writes instead of BIOS calls, 
        so  DOORWAY  never  sees  the characters  go  to  the  screen.  
        Replace  the driver with the ANSI driver which comes with  DOS 
        or  ANSI.COM  from PC magazine.  Also, the  programs  you  are 
        running  may be doing direct screen writes.  These can not  be 
        redirected  normally.   You  may try putting a  "/Q:"  in  the 
        command line to see if it will support redirection of  output, 
        or set up DOORWAY for direct screen write mode (/V:D).

     Q. Why  do you read everything from the command line  instead  of 
        from a config file like everyone else does?

     A. I  have  never  liked  to  add  a  bunch  of  files  for   any 
        application.   The  config file would be  different  for  each 
        door,  and  if you are using DOORWAY for 10  different  doors, 
        that would add 10 more files.  Also, when modifying a door, it 


                                  - 22 -



        is more confusing to trace the names though different files to 
        determine  which config. file should be modified.  Lastly,  it 
        takes time to load the config. file, and as we all know, doors 
        are slow enough as it is.

     Q. I am very confused on the order of the switches in the DOORWAY 
        command line.

     A. There  are only two things which have to be in any  particular 
        place.   The COM1, COM2, SYS PORT or LOCAL must be  the  first 
        item after DOORWAY, and either /C:DOS or /P:FILENAME.EXT  must 
        be the last switch on the command line.

     Q. I  am  using DOORWAY in direct screen mode.  when  the  cursor 
        gets  to  the  bottom of the screen, the  screen  gets  really 
        messed up.  What can I do?

     A. You  either  have a 24 line com program running, or  your  com 
        program isn't translating the "don't wrap line" ansi sequence.  
        Use  a 25 line com program and use a /B:Z or a version of  the 
        com program which supports the ansi.

     Q. I have registered DOORWAY, and now I find a later version on a 
        local board. Do I have to register it also to use it?

     A. Your  registration number is good for all future  versions  of 
        DOORWAY.   Simply register it just like you did  your  earlier 
        version.   If  you have lost your number,  then  type  DOORWAY 
        REGISTER  on your earlier version and it will give your  board 
        name  and registration number back to you.  Be sure  you  have 
        your  registration number before copying the new version  over 
        the old!

     Q. I registered DOORWAY some time ago.  Now I notice the price is 
        higher   for  the  new  version  with  direct   screen   write 
        capability.   I  think it is well worth it, but do I  need  to 
        send the full $30 or just the difference?

     A. We  have always said that if you register DOORWAY  all  future 
        versions  are free.  We stand behind our word.  You  supported 
        us  when  we had less to offer and it is only fair for  us  to 
        support you.  There is no additional charge.

     Q. I  have had to change my board name.  I have already paid  for 
        DOORWAY but now it says "REGISTERED TO:" my old board's  name.  
        What can I do?

     A. Once  we verify that you have really changed the  board  name, 
        you can get a new registration number for the new name.   Note 
        that  the old name and registration number will no  longer  be 
        valid and it will be illegal to use them.

     Q. I am running multi-nodes.  Do I have to register more than one 
        copy?



                                  - 23 -



     A. If  all  nodes have the same board name, and are at  the  same 
        location,  then  one registration is all you need.  (who  else 
        does that????).  If you are using the program privately for  a 
        remote utility,  it can be placed on multiple machines AS LONG 
        AS  NO MORE THAN ONE COPY HAS A POSSIBILILITY OF BEING RUN  AT 
        ONCE.  For instance, you could put it on both your computer at 
        work and at home, so you can log in either way.  This does not 
        mean  that  a  company can have a copy on a BBS  and  all  the 
        employees can take it home.

     Q. When NOT in direct screen write mode, all the  Carriage/Return 
        Line  Feeds  are missing, when doing a drop to DOS,  and  with 
        some programs.

     A. Your  Video BIOS does not follow the IBM standard.  It can  be 
        either  the BIOS which came with your computer, or if you  are 
        using a EGA or VGA, it may be the BIOS which this board  loads 
        (Paradise  VGA  PLUS,  for example). Try putting  in  the  /J: 
        switch to tell DOORWAY to not expect compatibility.

     Q. Why should I register DOORWAY?

     A. It allows you to do some other things not available if you  do 
        not  register  it.   Also,  I have  spent  hundreds  of  hours 
        creating  a  good  package  which  is  needed  by  the   BOARD 
        community.   Future changes to PCBOARD and compilers can  make 
        door  programs not work anymore.  The only way I can  continue 
        supporting  this product is if those who are using it  support 
        my  efforts  through  registration.   Let's  be  honest.   The 
        closest thing to this program will cost you over $300, so  $30 
        is  a  very good deal.  If you put 10 programs  into  DOORWAY, 
        that  is only $3.00 each, and for a remote drop to DOS, it  is 
        unmatched.   User  support  is directly  responsible  for  the 
        latest version with direct screen write mode.  I would like to 
        give many thanks to those who have supported us.

     Q. When  in DIRECT SCREEN WRITE MODE, the screen is 1 line higher 
        than when not in DIRECT SCREEN MODE.  Why is that?

     A. You are using the /B:M or /B:MZ.  The host has 25 lines  which 
        have to be mapped into 24 lines on the remote end.  When using 
        BIOS  mode the bottom line is "moved" to line 24,  overwriting 
        it.  If you put in a /B:MS or /B:MSZ, the screen gets scrolled 
        first  so  it  won't overwrite.  In direct  screen  mode,  the 
        writing  of the screen and the redirecting of  the  characters 
        are totally asyncronous with each other.  Moving the output up 
        1 line, and eliminating the top line, is the only way to avoid 
        creating   a  real  mess.  If  this  creates   problems,   try 
        eliminating the bottom line with a /B:X.

     Q. I  can't  seem to get DOORWAY to work with 4DOS.   What  am  I 
        doing wrong?

     A. Doorway will work with 4DOS, except 4DOS will use the ^ as  an 
        end  of  line.  Therefore, you cannot use a ^ in  the  DOORWAY 
        command line, or you will need to set up 4DOS to use something 
        other than a ^ of this function.

     Q. How do I get DSZ to work under DOORWAY?

     A. The  problem  with using DSZ under DOORWAY is that  the  block 
        transfer information, which DSZ writes to the local screen  on 
        the  HOST,  is being sent out the modem with  the  data,  thus 
        causing  CRC errors.  The simple solution is to  redirect  the 
        screen output to NUL like:

        DSZ port 1 speed 1200 pB4096 rz > NUL

        DSZ port 1 speed 2400 pB4096 sz > NUL 

     Q. When I type DOORWAY REGISTER the computer locks up.  What am I 
        doing wrong?

     A. You  probably  have  a memory resident program  which  is  not 
        handling  the  keyboard  interrupt  properly.   I  have   been 
        informed that QUICKEY will cause this problem.

                                APPENDIX A


     It  has been reported that some systems (on the remote end)  will 
     not work properly if they have been switched to 30 line mode  and 
     back to 25.  I don't have any more information on this.  You will 
     have  to  reboot  and reload your com package if  you  have  this 
     problem.

     Many of the communications programs have recently added a DOORWAY 
     mode.  The following lists the programs which have the capability 
     to  send the extended key codes, such as the Function  Keys,  Alt 
     keys,  and cursor keys.  Internal means that a simple  key  entry 
     will  put the program into "DOORWAY" mode.  Key file  means  that 
     there  must  be  a key definition file which must  be  loaded  to 
     implement this capability.  The key file may be distributed  with 
     the  communications program, or may have to be downloaded from  a 
     bulletin board.  Generally, using a key file is more  complicated 
     than if it is implemented internally.

HEART.WEL:

  Welcome to the HEARTS DOOR!  This is just the normal card game hearts.
The things you don't want are:
QUEEN OF SPADES (It counts 13 points against you), and
any hearts (Unless you are planning on running them).

To run them (Which makes all other players go set 26 points) what you do is
get all the hearts, and the queen of spades.  The hearts and queen don't count
against you, if you are successful in running them.  You better be pretty sure
you can get all the hearts and the queen though, because if you get all but
one heart, you lose A LOT of points!  At the beginning, the computer will
say to pass three cards to the right, and ask you to pick them.  You will
probably want to pass things like an ace of spades, or a king of hearts or
something, so that you don't end up taking unwanted cards (If you are not
planning to run them).  You must follow suit (If you can).  This means that
if a diamond is led, you have to play a diamond also, unless you are void
of diamonds.  If you are void of diamonds, you will probably want to play
the queen, or a hearts card.  By the way, the lowest score wins in this game.

  Well, guess that is about it.  You can abort this DOOR with a CTRL K, or
a CTRL X at any time.

     be  liable  or responsible for any damages resulting  to  you  or 
     others   from  your  use  of  the  Program.   You   assume   full 
     responsibility for determining what use(s) the Program  serve(s), 
     if  any,  and whether the Program meets your  requirements.   The 
     LICENSOR  makes  no  representations  whatsoever  concerning  the 
     performance,   acceptability  and/or  compatibility   with   your 
     equipment  and operation of the Program provided.

          (4) Limitation Of Damages

     You  agree  that  with  respect  to  any  claims  of  any  nature 
     whatsoever that you or any other party may have against  LICENSOR 
     resulting  from  use  of  the Program,  that  LICENSOR  shall  be 
     notified  in  writing by you of the claim within 30 days  of  the 
     incident  or  occurrence  giving rise to the  claim,  mailed,  by 
     certified letter to:
                           Marshall Dudley
                           406 Monitor Lane
                           Knoxville, TN  37922
     
     You  agree  that in no event shall LICENSOR be  liable  for  any 
     indirect,   incidental,  consequential,  special,  or   exemplary 
     damages or lost profits, even if LICENSOR has been advised of the 
     possibility  of such damages.  You further agree that if for  any 
     reason  the LICENSOR is found to be liable to you as a result  of 
     your   use  of  the  program  and  software,  that   as   partial 
     consideration  of  the LICENSOR granting you  this  license,  you 
     agree that LICENSOR'S sole and exclusive cumulative liability  to 
     you  or  others  shall  be no greater  than  the  amount  of  any 
     registration  fee  paid  by you.  SOME STATES DO  NOT  ALLOW  THE 
     LIMITATION   OR   EXCLUSION  OF  LIABILITY  FOR   INCIDENTAL   OR 
     CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION  MAY 
     NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          (5)  Proprietary Protection

               (a)   The  Program  is furnished to you  for  the  sole 
     purpose of enabling you to determine whether to register  Program 
     with  the  LICENSOR.  You shall use the Program solely  for  such 
     purpose, and shall not, without the prior written approval of the 
     LICENSOR,  either allow any third party to use, or yourself  use, 
     the Program for any other purpose or for the benefit of any third 
     party.

               (b)  This Agreement conveys to you only a limited right 
     of use, fully revocable in accordance with the provisions of this 
     Agreement.   Except for such right of use, you shall  not  assert 
     any  right,  title,  or  interest in or to  the  Program  or  any 
     pertinent documentation.

               (c)   The  LICENSOR hereby represents, and  you  hereby 
     acknowledge,  that the program and software  contain  substantial 
     Trade  Secrets  of  the LICENSOR; such Trade  Secrets  have  been 
     entrusted to you for use only as expressly authorized under  this 
     Agreement.   Under  no circumstances may you  decompile,  reverse 
     engineer,  or  "unlock"  as the term is  generally  used  in  the 
     industry, the program and software.

               (d)  LICENSOR claims and reserves to itself all  rights 
     and   benefits  afforded  under  U.S.  copyright  law   and   all 
     international  copyright  conventions  in  the  Program  and  any 
     pertinent  documentation as restricted, unpublished works, or  as 
     copyrighted material, as the case may be.

               (e)   You  shall devote your best  efforts,  consistent 
     with  the practices and procedures under which you  protect  your 
     own  most  valuable  proprietary information  and  materials,  to 
     protect  the Program and any pertinent documentation against  any 
     unauthorized or unlawful use or copying.

               (f)  
     You  shall make no hard copies of the Program, and may  store  in 
     memory  only  so much programming as authorized by the  terms  of 
     this agreement.  Upon expiration of 30 days after your first  use 
     of  the program and software, you shall permanently cease use  of 
     the program and software, unless it has been registered  pursuant 
     to provisions of this agreement.

          (6)   Registration:  You agree that after using the  program 
     and  software provided for thirty (30) days from first  use,  you 
     will not use or test the program and software, unless it has been 
     registered with the LICENSOR in one of the two following manners:

               (a)  You can register by filling out the $5.00 discount 
     coupon located at the BACK of this book and send with $25.00 to: 

                         Marshall Dudley

                         Knoxville, TN  37922

               (b)   You can also register by calling Data World  BBS, 
     and  go into the DOORWAY registration door (DOOR 18)  which  will 
     allow  you to register your software on*line in only a couple  of 
     minutes.  You  will receive your registration  number  while  you 
     wait.   Be  sure and have either your VISA, MASTERCARD,  or  AMEX 
     card handy before entering the door.  Please note that the  $5.00 
     off coupon is not valid when registering on*line, and that  using 
     a  false  or  stolen credit card number to obtain  a  product  or 
     service  may  be a crime. When you register, you will  receive  a 
     Registration number for your copy of DOORWAY (TM).

               (c)    After  completing  registration  you   will   be 
     registered  in  the  DOORS conference on  Data  World  BBS.   The 
     registration  number  permits  you to make  your  demo*version  a 
     fully*operational,  registered version.  You agree not to  defeat 
     the  registration,  or  to distribute  a  registered  version  of 
     DOORWAY  (TM) to anyone.  If you have any questions or  comments, 
     feel free to contact the home board:

               (d)  Registration of the Program shall be exclusive  to 
     the person registering said program and software, and you may not 
     transfer the registered program and software to or provide copies 
     of  the  registered program and software to third  parties.   The 
     registered   program  and  software  shall  be  subject  to   all 
     provisions and conditions of this agreement.

               (e)   The specifications of this product and the  terms 
     and  conditions of its registration are subject to change at  any

     prior or future notification to you.

          (7)   Trademark:   DOORWAY (TM) and  "Doorway  to  Unlimited 
     Doors" (TM) are registered trademarks of the Licensor.  No right, 
     or  interest  to such trademarks are granted hereunder,  and  you 
     agree that no such right, license, or interest shall be  asserted 
     by you with respect to such trademarks.

          (8)   Governing Law:  This Agreement shall be construed  and 
     governed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee.

          (9)  Ambiguity:  As partial consideration for this agreement 
     and  use  of  the Program, you hereby agree  that  any  ambiguity 
     contained in this agreement shall be construed most favorably  to 
     the LICENSOR.

          (10)   Severability:   Should  any  term  of  this   License 
     Agreement  be  declared  void or unenforceable by  any  court  of 
     competent jurisdiction, such declaration shall have no effect  on 
     the remaining terms hereof.

          (11)  No Waiver:  The failure of either party to enforce any 
     rights  granted  hereunder or to take action  against  the  other 
     party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed  a 
     waiver  by that party as to subsequent enforcement of  rights  or 
     subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.

          (12)  Venue and Jurisdiction:  You hereby agree by virtue of 
     this  agreement that any and all actions brought by  you  against 
     LICENSOR   shall   be  brought  before  a  Court   of   competent 
     jurisdiction  in Knox County, Tennessee, and that as between  you 
     and the LICENSOR, that this License Agreement shall be deemed  to 
     have been entered into in Knox County, Tennessee.
