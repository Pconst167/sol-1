--->> Minor Revisions from 1.10 <<---------------------------------------------

 - Increased some speed
 - Lessened file size, by getting rid of stale code

 I was stuck with the problem of creating identities for various things-
leeching PD boards that I really didn't have time to fuck with, or creating
accounts on other known services :). Everytime I'd go to create a new account,
I'd have to quickly think of a name, which wasn't so quick. Then I had to
figure out where in the world this person was going to live, AND what the
zip code + AC was- by this time I had timed out. It became too much of a
burden, so I decided to write this little jewel to help some of you with the
same problem that faced me.

-= How it works

 In the early stages of programming, I ran into problems with loading the
data files, and creating more that one identity- which was no good. The only
way I could overcome this was by re-loading the files everytime I ran it (I
know that's inefficient, but it will be condensed in the next release).
For this reason, those of you that will run this off a floppy drive, will
see a slight lag of loading time, not much but a small flicker, but still, it's
slower than it could be. On a HD however, you should see no real interruptions.

-= How to run it!

 To run FakE!, simply type FAKE <M/F> <# of identities>, where the <M/F>
relates to whether you want a Male account created or a Female account. Be
sure to have all the .IDX files in the same dir as the FAKE.EXE, or it will
error-out. FakE! will then output in the following format:

<firstname> <lastname>
<house #> <street>
<city>, <State-2 letter> <Zip Code>
(<ac>)xxx-xxxx

 You should also be able to run this from your com-program as a macro, to
execute it in a time of need (I've had enough of 'em, believe me.)

 Look for future updates to the program- I intend to improve it from it's
current state.. Please leave me mail: crax@sanjuan.santafe.edu,
if you have any questions (or would like to bitch me out about it :))
Have fun, and happy accounting. (?????)
