           This 'CHECKOUT' BBS distributes software for the sole purpose
      of testing prior to purchase.  You've 24 hours to try the software
      and determine that it is worth  purchasing, then you must  destroy
      it.   The  BBS Sysop feels  that it is  unfair to  computer  users
      that they are unable to evaluate software to see if it suits their
      needs.  Many  users have purchased products by the way the program
      'looks' on the box and have been extremely disappointed - and have
      therefore wasted their money and (more important) time.  Nobody in
      their right  mind would purchase a  car  without  test  driving it
      first,  or  for  that  matter...purchase  clothes  without  trying
      them  on, so how  can  software  vendors  expect users to  buy one
      of their products without first testing it?  They will send copies
      of their software to large corporations to test but seem to forget
      there are also other users in the market willing to purchase their
      product if it meets their needs.   This is where this checkout BBS
      comes in.   This program is for evaluation only,  if you like this
      product  then  go  to  your  local computer store and purchase it,
      otherwise PLEASE do not USE or in anyway DISTRIBUTE this  product!
      There are many advantages to purchasing this product including:

      1) Technical Support: Software vendors set  up  technical  support
                            lines  for  the  purpose  of  helping  their
                            registered users get the  most  out  of  the
                            product and help with any bug concerns, etc.
                            It is to your advantage to be  able  to  use
                            this (and the many features of the program).

      2) Manuals:           Manuals are  a  very  important  part  of  a
                            software package.  No book  or text file can
                            replace the  original  manuals,  which  come
                            with the product. This enables  the  user to
                            get the most out of the package,  especially
                            with the very complex programs of today.

      3) Upgrades:          With  buying  the  original program, you are
                            entitled  to  low priced or free upgrades to
                            new versions, bug fixes, and 'enhancements'.

      4) Legality:          Using a program  without owning a registered
                            copy is illegal.

      5) Control Of The     When  companies  who  create  good  products
         Industry:          are  supported,  it  reinforces the need for
                            good products and helps the company continue
                            to create more  quality  products.   On  the
                            other hand, companies who create substandard
                            products have  two  options; either  improve
                            their products or get out of the industry.

      Until  companies come up with a better  way  of  allowing  users  to
      test their products before purchasing, 'checkout' BBSs will continue
      to make available products  for  your  testing.  Companies  recently
      have started to head in this  direction and you can now return  some
      products  to  the  company  if  you  are  not  completely  satisfied
      (Norton, and a few others), but this does not remedy  the  situation
      as the refund/credit takes a long time to get processed and is a BIG
      hassle!   We feel that under the current software industry standards
      of doing business, that evaluating software releases prior to actual
      purchase is still the best solution.
