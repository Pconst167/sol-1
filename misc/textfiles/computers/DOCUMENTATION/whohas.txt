
WhoHas.EXE  v1.1

Purpose:  Find users who currently access a given file on a file server 
          NetWare v2.1x, v2.2x, and v3.x

Syntax:   WHOHAS path/file [/cont] [/wait]

          The option '/Continous' will permanently display the 
          connections that have the file open until a key is pressed.

          The option '/Wait' will do the same as '/Cont' but will 
          stop the program as soon as no connection uses the file.
          This is useful for batch files where operations have to 
          wait until a file is released by other users.

Features: - WHOHAS runs a self-check for virus infections;
          - output can be redirected with std DOS commands
          - WHOHAS returns DOS error levels:
            either the number of connections using the file, or
            a NetWare Error:
              $98 (152): Unknown volume
              $9C (156): Invalid Path/File
              $C6 (198): No Console Rights
