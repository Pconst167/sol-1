Overview

     PROVIEW is a menu driven program used to analyze, view
     and edit the basic components of a system, including the
     system memory, system interrupts, device drivers, and
     installed disk drive sectors and file contents.  PROVIEW 
     will allow you to view system elements in HEX, ASCII or 
     disassembled code format.  Full searching and editing 
     functions are included.

     PROVIEW displays data in real time.  For example, if you are
     viewing a memory location that is being updated by
     the system (the clock interrupt, for example), PROVIEW
     will display the changes as they occur.

     PROVIEW provides an extensive on-line context sensitive
     help function.  At any point in the program you may press
     the <F1> key to display help text for the process you are
     currently engaged in.  NOTE: The PV.HLP file must be
     in the same directory as the PV.EXE file.

     PROVIEW is Novell Network aware.  You may view any network
     file and edit any network file that is not locked.

Using The Menus

     After you have entered the PROVIEW menu system (type
     PV at the DOS prompt), you will be able to move
     about the PROVIEW menus to access all of the system
     functions. To pull down one of the available menus,
     press the ALT key and the highlighted letter of the
     menu you want or use the mouse to select the pulldown
     list. For example, to access the Memory menu, press
     ALT-M. To access the functions within the pulldown
     list, you can either use the arrow keys to move the
     highlight to the option you want and press ENTER,
     select the option with the mouse, or press the letter
     that is highlighted in that option. For example, in the
     Memory menu to access the list of interrupt vectors,
     press I.

     The PROVIEW menu system allows you to open more than
     one window at a time to view the system parameters.

Using the PROVIEW Windows

     The Window menu contains commands to close, move and
     perform other window-management commands. Most of the
     windows in this program have all the standard window
     elements, including scroll bars, a close box, and zoom
     icons.

     Size/Move  (Ctrl-F5)

          When you choose Size/Move, the active window moves
          in response to the arrow keys. Once you've moved
          the window to where you want it, press Enter.

          If you press Shift while you use the arrow keys,
          you can change the size of the active window. Once
          you've adjusted its size or position, press Enter.

          You can also move a window by dragging its title
          bar with the mouse. If a window has a Resize
          corner, you can drag that corner with the mouse to
          resize the window.

     Zoom  (F5)

          Choose Zoom to resize the active window to the
          maximum size. If the window is already zoomed, you
          can choose this command to restore it to its
          previous size.

          You can also double-click anywhere on the window's
          title bar (except where an icon appears) to zoom
          or unzoom the window.

     Next  (Ctrl-F6)

          Choose Next to cycle forwards through the windows
          on the desktop.

     Close  (Ctrl-F4)

          Choose Close to close the active window.

          You can also click the Close box in the upper
          right corner to close a window.

     Cascade

          Choose Cascade to stack all file viewers on the
          desktop.

     Save Edited Object

          Permits saving any changes you have made without
          having to exit the current edit in process.

     Read only   (Default = No)

          This options allows you to enable or disable the
          Read Only function. When enabled (ON), you will
          not be able to change or edit any system data with
          the PROVIEW program. To make changes, and be able
          to save them, toggle this option to read NO.

     Exit to DOS

          Returns you to the DOS prompt. Be sure to save any
          changes that you have made before exiting.

The MEMORY Menu

          System memory may be viewed and edited by PROVIEW.  
          Memory may be viewed in HEX, ASCII or disassembled
          code format.  If viewing in assembler format, you
          may follow the control of the program by selecting
          the numbers in parenthesis to the right of each 
          branch instruction that is displayed on the screen.
          to reverse the flow of control, press (0) to return 
          to the previous branch instruction.

          The following options are available in the Memory Menu:

     DOS System Area

          View/Edit the DOS System Area, starting at 0K and
          continuing as much as space as necessary for all
