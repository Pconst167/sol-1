      PPRINT
      ------

      PPRINT is a general purpose print utility that can be used with
      HP laser or other printers.

      PPRINT will scan a directory and select files for printing.
      Print control parameters govern the print process.  A special
      print feature for the HP laserjet printer allows printing
      two pages on both halves of a side of paper.  This is especially
      nice for printing large documents as it saves paper and print
      time.

      PPRINT is special and unique because it is customisable to
      any printer type.  It also allows you to access printer
      features not normally availaable for printing normal text files.

      I know there are too many command parameters for each user to
      learn.  PPRINT has all these features to support the many
      different printers and features available today.  I have designed
      PPRINT to provide be a single utility that will accomplish most
      all print tasks.  An installation can standardize on one one print
      utility even though it has users with many different kinds of
      printers.

      Type the PPRINT command without parameters to get help about
      command parameters available.  Once you learn the parameters you
      use most often, set up DOS batch files to make printing easier.

      If you have questions, problems, ideas, or requests, please
      don't hesitate to contact me through my online support BBS.
      You are allowed immediate access the first call.  The number
      is 714-352-2825.

      Command Parameters
      ------------------

      PPRINT allows many command parameter switches to be specified to
      customize the printing process.  All these parameters are
      optional. The command format and switch parameters are described
      below.  A quick review of command parameters is always available
      by entering the PPRINT command with no parameters.

      COMMAND FORMAT:

      PPRINT  filespec  [ (/ switches) ]


      filespec  Enter a DOS file specification.  Pathnames and
                standard DOS wildcard characters are allowed.


      /AP       Set printer to print using PI FONT A character set.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /B:filename  When a wildcard name is supplied to indicate
                multiple files are to be printed, this parameter
                indicates to skip all files until this filename
                is found.


      /BA       BAtch command operation.  Causes PPRINT to ignore
                keystrokes entered during processing and to
                immediately end terminate processing when all
                printing is complete.  You will not be asked to press
                any key to erase the print status window.


      /BM:nn    Number of lines of bottom margin


      /BW       Force PPRINT to use black and white screen
                colors instead of its normal default attributes.


      /C        Sends code to printer to force compressed print.


      /CO:nn    Specify the number of copies of each file to be
                printed.
      PPRINT Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991    Patri-Soft     Page  3
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      /C2 /C3   These options change PPRINT's screen colors.  If you
                like the colors they produce over the standard colors,
                specify them using the SET PPRINT=/C2 command.  This
                will place them in the DOS environment where PPRINT can
                use them for each execution.


      /DB       Set printer to print using its Double Strike mode.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /DS       Double space printed output


      /D:[(]xxx Date.  Select files based on the relationship between
         [)]    their last update date and the date specified.  This
         [=]    parameter includes a date or number of days value.
                It may also contain a modifier that reverses or
                modifies the use of the date specified.

                When xxx contains a date the date is compared to the
                last update date of the file.  The last update date
                of the file is the date contained in its directory
                entry.  The file is selected if the condition specified
                by the condition modifier is met.  The condition
                modifier meanings are:

                  '(' =  Select files whose date is older than the
                         date specified.

                  ')' =  Select files whose date is newer than the
                         date specified. (default if none specified)

                  '=' =  Select files whose date is equal to the date
                         specified.

                Date values may be specified in any of these formats:
                    MM/DD/YY   MM-DD-YY   DDMMMYY
                    12/31/80   12-31-80   31DEC80

                If xxx contains a numeric value, that positive number
                is used to calculate a date value a number of days
                prior to the current date.  Then that date is used
                as in the calculation above.

                Example:
                /D:(1JAN86  - Process files updated before 1JAN86
                /D:)1JAN86  - Process files updated after 1JAN86
                /D:=1JAN86  - Process files updated 1JAN86
                /D:(5  - Process files modified prior to 5 days ago
                /D:)5  - Process files modified within the last 5 days
                /D:=5  - Process files modified 5 days ago

      /E        Sends code to printer to force emphasized print.


      /EQ       PPRINT normally asks the user to press a key before
                removing the print status window at the end of
                processing.  This parameter causes PPRINT to END
                QUICKLY and not wait for a user key press.


      /EX       Attempt to print the header and footer lines using
                dot matrix expanded print options.  If there is not
                enough room on the line this option will be ignored.


      /F        Print page footings at the bottom of each page.  This
                makes thumbing through listings to find a specific
                file much easier.


      /FC       Set printer to print using Courier type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /FE       Set printer to print using Prestiege Elite type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /FG       Set printer to print using Gothic Elite type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /FH       Set printer to print using Helvitca type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /FL       Set printer to print using Line Printer type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /FP       Print Footer line that contains Page number only.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      /FT       Set printer to print using Times Roman type face.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)

      /G        For printing C language source files.  This option
                prints ruler lines to help follow IF and DO sets
                of lines down and across pages.


      /HD       Print Header line that contains filename, date file
                was last updated, and page number.


      /HP       Print Header line that contains Page number only.


      /HT       PPRINT will prompt you for heading information to
                be placed in heading and footing lines.


      /HT:ccc   Specify heading information to be placed in heading
                and footing lines.  Since DOS does not allow spaces
                in command lines, enter an underline character '_'
                wherever you want a space printed.  PPRINT will
                substitute a space in those positions.

                I.E.  PPRINT *.BAT/ht:Disk_Batch_Files


      /IT       Use printers Italics print mode.
                (See also Printer Definition file)

      /LE       Set printer to print using LEGAL character set.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /LJ       Left Justify each line to be printed.


      /LL:nn    Number of characters to be allowed for each print
                line.  Longer lines will be truncated.


      /LM:nn    Number of characters for the left margin.


      /LO:nn    Ignore the first n characters and start printing
                with the nnth character in each print line. (Offset)


      /LP:nn    Lines per page.  66 lines assumed.  (11 inch * 6 lpi)


      /LPTn     Specify /LPT1 or /LPT2 or /LPT3 or /LPT4 to indicate the
                alternate printer PPRINT is to direct all output to.
                This has the same effect as specifying /PD:LPTn.

                Note, specification of LPT2 will cause PPRINT to attempt
                to use a printer definition file of PPRINT2.DEF. This
                allows a special printer definition file to be set up
                for different printers attached to your system.  If the
                special printer definition file is not found, PPRINT
                will look for the standard printer definition file
                PPRINT.DEF.


      /LQ       When the printer has letter quality mode, this parm
                activates it.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /ML:nn    Indicate the maximum number of lines to be printed.


      /MP:nn    Indicate the maximum number of pages to be printed.


      /N        Print a line number before each line printed.  Useful
                for printing program source listings.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      /NC       Ignore print control characters found in input lines.
                You may also want to specify /NE.


      /ND       PPRINT will search for duplicate input lines and
                ignore them.  This feature can be used to take any
                sorted text file and remove duplicate lines.

      /NE       Do not eject the paper by inserting Form Feed
                characters.

                SPECIAL FEATURE:  You can use this parameter to
                change a input file to upper case, lower case or
                for any of the other data manipulation features
                of PPRINT.  This causes PPRINT to pass the file
                through without added print control.

                The following example reads file X.TXT and creates
                file Y.TXT and converts it to upper case and
                removes duplicate lines.

                   PPRINT X.TXT/PD:Y.TXT/PU/ND/NE

                The next example takes the first 500 lines of file
                X.TXT and creates file Y.TXT.

                   PPRINT X.TXT/PD:Y.TXT/NE/ML:500

      /NF       Ignore Form Feed characters found in input files.
                Normally when PPRINT finds a form feed it honors
                it and skips to the top of the next page.  With
                /NF specified, the form feed is removed from the
                input and ignored.


      /NI       No envIronment variables.  Causes PPRINT to ignore any
                PPRINT= DOS environment variable parameters during
                processing.

      /NT       Do not expand tabs in input file.


      /NV       Disables PPRINT display of file lines on its display
                during processing.


      /NW       No Window causes PPRINT operation to write to the
                display like other DOS commands and not display and
                update a full screen status window during processing.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      /PA       Pause before each page is printed.  Use on single
                sheet printers to allow each new page to be placed
                in the printer.


      /PD:xxxx  Alternate print device name.  /PD:LPT2 will cause
                all output to be directed to printer 2.  LPT1 is
                assumed.  This can also be the name of a DOS file.


      /PF:xxxx  Specification of an alternate printer definition
                file name.  You may cause PPRINT to use any printer
                definition file you wish.  Just specify the name of
                the file as part of the /PF: parameter as shown by the
                following example. Any valid DOS file name may be used.

                    /PF:LASER2.DEF  or  /PF:LASER.2


      /PI       Set printer to print using PI FONT character set.
                For laser and other compatible printers.
                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /PL       Convert all print lines to lower case.


      /PU       Convert all print lines to upper case.

                (See also Printer Definition file)


      /PS       Print file over page perforation. Also consider
                /NE.

        Setting of default parameters (DOS Environment)
        -----------------------------------------------

        Default parameters are parameters that do  not need to be
        specified each time PPRINT is started.  Any PPRINT parameter may
        be specified as a default parameter.

        Use the DOS SET command to specify the parameter name and
        contents to be used by PPRINT each time it is started.  The
        following example indicates that PPRINT is always to assume /C
        and /NW are specified:

                SET PPRINT=/C/NW

        Once this DOS command is issued, each subsequent use of PPRINT
        will operate as if these parameters have been specified on the
        command line.  The SET command is most commonly placed in the
        AUTOEXEC.BAT file so it may be in effect every time your machine
        is started.

      The printer Definition file
      ---------------------------

      PPRINT is designed as a general purpose print utility to support
      any type or brand of printer.  There are many shareware programs
      available for different printers but few allow you to use the
      utility for any printer.  The reason for this incompatibility is
      because printer manufacturers have not standardized printer
      control codes. Each printer may require different codes to
      automatically activate special features.

      PPRINT overcomes the incompatibility problems with different
      printers by allowing you to define your printer and its control
      codes to it.  Instead of keeping track of printer control codes,
      you indicate type of printing desired and PPRINT will send the
      appropriate codes to the printer to accomplish it.

      These codes are defined in PPRINT's printer definition file.

      When started, PPRINT always reads a printer definition file from
      the root directory of the current disk drive, or from the
      directory where PPRINT.EXE is located.  This printer definition
      file contains control codes to activate the different features of
      your printer.

      The default printer definition file read by PPRINT is named
      PPRINT.DEF.  PPRINT supports environments where multiple printers
      are connected to your computer, and even allows you to specify
      dynamic printer definitions when you have printers connected to
      you computer using switch boxes.  No matter what printer is
      attached, you can still get the same results with PPRINT.

      Use the /PF: command to specify different printer definition files
      to PPRINT.  When you use PPRINT to print to LPT1 or PRN, it will
      look for, and use, PPRINT.DEF printer definition file.  When using
      another printer such as LPT2, PPRINT appends the printer number to
      the printer definition file name it looks for.  LPT3 would cause
      PPRINT to search for PPRINT3.DEF.  If the printer file is not
      found, PPRINT will default to the standard printer definition
      file, PPRINT.DEF.

      The printer definition file is a standard text file that may be
      edited by most any word processor or editor.  You may also use the
      DOS EDLIN command.  I have provided some commonly requested
      PRINTER.DEF files along with PPRINT. All you need to do is copy
      one to your disk, and give it the correct name.

      Use the DOS type command to type file PRINTDEF.DOC to see if your
      printer is included.
      PPRINT Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991    Patri-Soft     Page 14
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      If your printer is not included you can call the Patriquin Utility
      support BBS to determine if one is available for your printer.
      (data: 714-352-2825). If you still are unable to find one, you
      need to create one from an already existing file that is similar
      to your printer.

      Copy the existing printer definition file for the printer that
      resembles your printer closest.  Then edit that file for your
      printers characteristics.  Here is how.
      PPRINT Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991    Patri-Soft     Page 15
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Printer Definition Statements
      -----------------------------

      Each statement begins with a word identifier and may be followed
      by codes to be sent to the printer when the related feature is
      activated. You may include comments anywhere in the file by
      starting the line with an * character.

      Printer codes are specified as decimal numbers.  These numbers are
      the same numbers defined in your printer manual.  If your printer
      manual uses hexidecimal codes, you will first need to convert them
      to decimal values before including them on the statement.  If your
      printer defines character codes, convert the character to its
      ascii decimal value and specify the value or values on the
      statement.

      Character printer codes may also be specified, although their
      specification is a little more complex.  To indicate a character
      code is being specified, preceed the first character of the code
      with a period (.). Terminate the character code with a space.  A
      space may not be a part of a character code.  More than one
      character may be part of a character code and character codes may
      include the (.) period character.

      The following example shows a combination of character and numeric
      printer codes being defined.

          EMPH   27 .&l1O   27 .(s16.6H  27 .(s8.5V

      A special character code of ^ may be used to indicate an ascii
      escape character (27).  This is a commonly used printer code that
      is sometimes difficult to key in through a normal character
      editor.

      Specification of these keywords and codes accomplishes two things.
      First, it defines the capabilities of PPRINT for your environment.
      If a code is not specified, PPRINT will not allow you to specify a
      command parameter to activate the feature.  The command parameter
      will also be missing from the help display.

      The second thing accomplished by specifying the keywords is to
      give PPRINT the appropriate codes to send to your printer when it
      is asked to use a specific printer feature.

      commonly used command combinations you desire to use with PPRINT.

      To define your own PPRINT command parameters, include CDEF
      statements in the PPRINT printer definition file.  Following is a
      definition of how to specify the CDEF statement:

      CDEF statement format --

          CDEF command-id [parameters] printer codes   * help text
          ---- ---------- ------------ -------------   -----------

          command-id    Specify the command characters you wish to
                        associate with the dynamic command.  These
                        characters are the ones you will specify on the
                        PPRINT command to activate the special feature.
                        Any character combination (up to three
                        characters) may be used as long as they do not
                        conflict with already existing PPRINT command
                        values.

                            CDEF DF    would be activated with the /DF
                                       command parameter.

                        PPRINT will send the appropriate codes to the
                        printer immediately before starting the print
                        the first file.

                        PPRINT also allows you to specify codes to be
                        used to reset the printer when PPRINT is
                        completed.  To specify these reset codes,
                        specify a second CDEF statement with the same
                        command characters preceeded with a - character.
                        The codes specified on this statement will be
                        sent to the printer just before PPRINT
                        terminates.

                            CDEF -DF   would be activated with the /DF
                                       command parameter and associated
                                       codes will be sent to the printer
                                       just before pprint terminates.

          [parameters]  You may optionally specify command parameters to
                        be supplied when the dynamic command is used.
                        To specify command parameters on the CDEF
                        definition, include the / command values
                        immediately after the CDEF command id.  Include
                        a space before the first command.

                        The command parameters specified here will be
                        part of PPRINT processing just as if they were
                        specified on the PPRINT command.  They will only
                        be supplied to PPRINT when the associated CDEF
                        command id is specified on the PPRINT command.

                        The following CDEF statement would cause PPRINT
                        to assume 50 lines per page, 10 max pages, and
                        compressed print when the /DF parm is specified.

                            CDEF DF /LP:50/MP:10/C .......

          printer codes
                        Specify up to 30 printer control codes to be
                        sent to the printer when the CDEF command id is
                        specified on the PPRINT command.  These codes
                        are specified exactly like other PPRINT printer
                        control code definitions.

                        The following CDEF statement will send decimal
                        printer codes 15 20 and 21 to the printer when
                        the /DF parameter is specified on the PPRINT
                        command.

                            CDEF DF /LP:50 15 20 21

          * help text   Following printer codes associated with the CDEF
                        command id, you may specify help text to be
                        displayed when PPRINT help is requested.  This
                        text will briefly explain the CDEF command id
                        dynamically defined to PPRINT.

                        This help information will be displayed when you
                        enter the PPRINT command without any parameters.
                        Up to 60 characters of help information may be
                        specified.

                        The following example shows how help text is
                        associated with the dyanmically defined /DF
                        command parameter.

                         CDEF DF /LP:50 15 20 21 * print compressed bold

      Version 1.0     October 15, 1986

      Version 2.0     March 6, 1987

         Many corrections were made to release 2.  It appears OK now.
         Here is a short list.

         --  /LM (left margin) option corrected.  Was not working.
         --  /LL (line length) option now works with headers.
         --  Lines with more than 80 characters of data now work
         --  /HD, /HP options added.  It is no longer the default to
             print headers.  Use /HD and /HP to print headers.
         --  /EX (expanded headings/footings)  if headings or footings
             are desired in dot matrix expanded format, specify this
             parameter.
         --  Page ejected if printing terminated with escape


      Version 3.0     May 25, 1987

         I do not know where to start in describing the changes to
         this release.  PPRINT has been totally enhanced.  It includes
         a mass of new command line parameters to select all kinds of
         print options and also now has a printer definition file to
         allow users to define the attributes of their own printers.
         Extensive support has been added to support printing files
         on laser printers.

         Look for the vericle bar at the right side of the document.
         It indicates this feature has been added with release 3.0.
      PPRINT Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991    Patri-Soft     Page 26
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Version 3.1     June 7, 1987

         --  PPRINT was unable to print a file from a disk drive
             other than the current drive.  This was usually ok for
             hard disk users but created problems for floppy users.

         --  The PPRINT.DEF file no longer needs to be placed in the
             root directory.  It can now be placed in the same
             directory where PPRINT.EXE is found

         --  /HT added to allow user to be prompted to enter their
             own print heading information on the PPRINT command
             line.

         --  Help screens showed options not available for all
             printers.

         --  Generic PPRINT.DEF file added so PPRINT could be used
             on all printers.

         --  Automatic generation of headings and other options for
             specific file types was disabled.  This seemed to get
             in users way.


      Version 3.2     August 1987

         --  RESET keyword added to .DEF file.  It specifies codes
             to be sent to the printer every time PPRINT terminates.

             Following is an example:

                 RESET 27 46


      Version 3.5     January 17, 1988

         --  Bottom margin setting was not working correctly
         --  PPRINT always printed one too many lines per page
         --  Double space printing was printing one extra line on
             some pages
         --  No eject at top of page 2 when /2e specified

      PPRINT Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991    Patri-Soft     Page 27
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

         --  Laser 2-up print setup definitions added to Hplaser
             printer definition file.
         --  /Sx options were not showing on help screens when
             other than a laser printer is used.
         --  Many new printer definition files for other printers.


      Version 3.6     February 3, 1988

         --  Corrected /S side-by-side print option for HP Laser

         --  HP laser printer printed page with P at beginning

         --  Correct problem causing dates in form of 1/1/88 to be
             rejected.


      Version 3.7     May 21, 1988

         --  INIT parameter codes were not being sent to printer.

         --  Tabs were unlike DOS tab printing.  Now PPRINT should
             work like DOS.

         --  /NT parameter will bypass PPRINT tabs expansion and let
             the printer do the work.


      Version 3.8     May 29, 1988

         --  Older versions only checked for form feeds in input file
             in the first position of a line.  This version checks
             all positions of each line.

         --  /B: begin file now accepts wildcard names.


      Version 3.82    July 4, 1988

         --  /TS: /TP: /TX: parm can specify multiple words with spaces
             using ~ for spaces in input command line.

         --  After first page is printed, PPRINT will estimate number
             of pages left to print and show on display.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Version 3.83    December 10,1988

         --  Detect and properly print lines that have form feed imbedded in
             in them.

         --  Properly set print codes when restarting printing with
             the /SP:nn parameter.


      Version 4.0     July 4, 1989

         --  Support SET PPRINT= environment variable to allow PPRINT
             default commands to be set in your environment.
         --  Add real windows support for better display.
         --  Support multiple printers and printer definition files.
             When pprint prints to LPT1, PPRINT.DEF will be used.
             When pprint prints to LPT2, PPRINT2.DEF will be used.
             You may pprint set up to work properly with all your printers.
             The current printer definition file is displayed on the
             PPRINT display.
         --  Added dynamic pprint keyword command definitions.  Now you can
             make your own PPRINT / command codes to take advantage of
             special features of your printer.  The command codes can even
             contain imbedded command codes.  Kind of like macro commands.
             Dynamic commands also are shown in pprint help.
         --  /SET and /RSET commands allow you to use pprint to set up
             printer options for other programs.
         --  Corrected some problems with page ejecting and margins.
         --  PPRINT.DEF file may now contain character and decimal printer
             control codes.
         --  PPRINT display can optionally show lines being sent to the printer
         --  /PF: command allows you to specify any alternate printer
             definition file.
         --  /LPT1 and /LPT2 commands direct to appropriate printer.


      Version 4.0b    July 27, 1989

         --  Add windowed help

      Version 5.0     July 25, 1990

         -- Converted to Borland TURBOC compiler
         -- Added /BA batch mode.  Ignore keypress
         -- Added /EQ to exit without asking for keypress
