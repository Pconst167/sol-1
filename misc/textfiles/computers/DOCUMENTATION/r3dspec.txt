PRODUCT INFORMATION:

[*]REAL3D is an unprecedented initiative that puts high-end visual 
simulation capability into the hands of users seeking to exploit 
real-time 3-D graphics technology for price-sensitive professional 
and consumer applications. The R3D/PRO-1000 gives computer simulation 
and training professionals an unmatched price/performance package 
for developing and delivering real time 3-D simulation products. 
Key applications include ship handling, flight simulation, driver 
training, rail training, and location based entertainment. 

The R3D/PRO-1000 was announced at the ITEC conference (April 1995) 
and will be available for limited release for qualified partners 
and application developers beginning Q4/95. Shipments to U.S. and 
foreign customers will begin Q1/96. 
COMPANY INFORMATION:

Formed by the merger of Lockheed with Martin Marietta in 1995, Lockheed 
Martin is the world's largest defense, DOE, and NASA contractor. 
The Information Systems Company, part of Martin Marietta before the 
merger, employs 2,600. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:

The R3D/PRO-1000 consists of a geometry processor and one, two or 
four pixel processors. This unit can provide one or two display channels,
and multiple units can be connected to one host processor, using 
differential SCSI II bus. 

[I]
UPDATE RATE:

Basic system performance is specified as 30 Hz, but 60 Hz update 
is also available. 
TRANSPORT DELAY:

Transport delay for the R3D/PRO-1000 is measured from the time a 
control input is received from the Application Host until the end 
of the display of the first video field affected by that input. The 
normal transport delay is 112 milliseconds for 30 Hz operation, or 
56 ms for 60 Hz operation. 
HOST INTERFACE:

Differential SCSI II ports are utilized to pass database and real-
time control parameters to the R3D/PRO-1000. SCSI II provides maximum 
flexibility in two critical areas: the number of channels, and the 
selection of host control computers. SCSI II permits from one to 
seven devices to be connected to one controller card; users simply 
add more controller cards to the host computer to expand channel 
capacity. Since the R3D/PRO-1000 can be driven by any computer containing 
a differential SCSI II port, it will operate in just about any host 
environment, from personal computers to high-powered workstations. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM CAPACITY:


POLYGONS PER CHANNEL:

Throughput averages 750,000 polygons per second per R3D/PRO-1000 
unit. Polygons are fully rendered, textured, shaded, fogged, anti-
aliased, translucent, three- or four-vertex objects in the scene. 

POLYGONS PER SYSTEM:

The 750,000 polygons per second can be concentrated in one channel,
or distributed across two video channels. 
LIGHTS PER CHANNEL:

Point lights are rendered as special case polygons, with minimum 
size clamps to ensure the light does not extinguish until desired. 
Modifiers to the range fading function also ensure that point lights 
realistically "poke through the haze." Point lights are rendered 
for raster displays, and can be traded 1:1 for polygons. 
LIGHTS PER SYSTEM:

As described above, the limit on point lights is based on how many 
polygons are traded off. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISPLAY ISSUES:


PIXEL FORMATS:

The display formats are controlled by software, and can be changed 
easily by loading initialization scripts. One channel can have up 
to 1022H X 768V pixels. Support for RS-170 and RS-343 standard video 
timing and levels is provided. The system will support both interlaced 
and non-interlaced display configurations for a wide variety of display 
devices. 
PIXEL FILL RATE:

A single pixel fill processor is capable of providing a fill rate 
of 50 million pixels per second. Two or four processors can be plugged 
into the same board to increase this rate to 100 or 200 million pixels 
per second. 
DISTORTION CORRECTION:

Linear (keystone) distortion correction, the ability to supply channels 
with unequal half-angles, is a standard capability of the R3D/PRO-
1000. 
DISPLAY REQUIREMENTS:

The R3D/PRO-1000 does not require the display to extend the length 
of a field, and can thus be used with commonly available inexpensive 
display devices. 

R3D/PRO-1000 uses a video genlock signal to ensure all display channels 
are updated at the same instant in time. This signal can be from 
the output of the R3D/PRO-1000 or from an external source. Output 
signals are standard analog RGB and composite sync. 
OPTIONS:

Up to four pixel fill processors can be applied to a configuration 
for up to two output channels or higher pixel depth complexity. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEXTURE:

Color texture maps derived from several sources including high-altitude 
aerial photography, satellite imagery, and hand-held cameras, can 
be applied to provide high detail imagery. The addition of texture 
does not affect the polygon processing capacity. 
TEXTURE MEMORY:

Rich, photographic quality surface detail can be created using up 
to 192, 128 x 128 texel full-color trilinear interpolated MIP-mapped 
texture maps. True-perspective corrected texture maps are applied 
in hardware, in real-time using patented algorithms developed during 
15 years of pioneering visual systems design. Smooth detail transitions 
are assured with up to nine blended levels of detail, including microtexture 
processing, to provide the critical detail needed for "up-close" 
applications. 

Texture maps are stored as sixteen bits per texel. The sixteen bits 
can be assigned in any of the following ways: 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿ4 bit monochrome texturing 
ÿÿÿ8 bit monochrome texturing 
ÿÿÿ16 bit (4 ea. R, G, B color + 4 bit translucency) 
ÿÿÿ16 bit (5 ea. R, G, B color + 1 bit contour) 


MAP SIZES:

Texture maps can be as small as 32 x 32 texels, or as large as 512 
x 512 texels. The map allocation is performed during database design. 

MAPS PER POLYGON:

One standard map (with color and translucency) and one microtexture 
map can be applied per polygon. Control of size, direction, and sharpness 
is provided to the database designer on a per-polygon basis. 
TEXTURE PLACEMENT:

Each polygon's vertices are linked to specific locations in the texture 
map. Adjacent polygons which share vertices are processed to ensure 
no discontinuities exist. 
TEXTURE FEATURES:

Both color and monochrome texture maps are available. The full color 
information is stored in the map, and users are not limited to merely 
modulating between two discrete colors. 

Maps can repeat within a polygon, or can "mirror" the map contents,
allowing users to save map space. Singular or repeating texture maps 
can join at polygon boundaries with no detectable seam. 

Microtexture is provided to increase the dynamic range of the photographic 
texture to cover faraway to near surface distances. Microtexture 
allows two different texture patterns to be added together and placed 
on any surface. The microtexture pattern will emerge as the viewpoint 
moves closer to the textured surface. Microtexture is a user-defined 
high contrast generic pattern. 
TEXTURE MANAGEMENT:

A pixel's texturing is determined by trilinear interpolation smoothing 
between the adjacent texture elements (texels) and LODs. All possible 
LODs are stored in a MIP-mapped image pyramid, for simultaneous real-
time access. All calculations are performed with the precision necessary 
to avoid texture aliasing, and prevent LOD "bow-wave" effects. 
TEXTURE PAGING:

The R3D/PRO-1000 can update the contents of texture map memory based 
on commands from the Host CPU at a non-real-time rate. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRIORITY TECHNIQUE:

The R3D/PRO-1000 uses a Z buffer with 22 bit floating point precision 
(six bits exponent, 16 bits mantissa) per pixel. Layering of co-planar 
polygons and forced (high priority) polygons are available. 
LEVELS OF OCCULTING:

Since the R3D/PRO-1000 is a Z buffer architecture, the number of 
occulting levels is only limited by the number of polygons being 
processed. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

ANTI-ALIASING:

Real-time anti-aliasing, typically the most expensive component of 
image generator hardware, is traditionally overlooked in industry 
attempts to provide low cost, high performance graphics engines. 
Lockheed Martin breaks the tradition with a patent pending algorithm 
that bridges the price/performance gap and offers image quality normally 
found in much higher priced competitive systems. 

Polygon edges are anti-aliased with the new S-Buffer algorithm. This 
algorithm avoids the high costs of storing subpixel information, 
yet achieves nearly identical performance. Several polygons may occupy 
a single pixel, and the S-Buffer will resolve the partial polygon 
areas with a resolution of one part in sixteen. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DATABASE MANAGEMENT:

All database management must be performed by the Host CPU. The polygon 
processor supports four levels of detail for database objects, and 
128 feature types. This flexibility allows designers precise control 
over database complexity, allowing them to fully minimize the risks 
of real-time scene degradation. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERLOAD MANAGEMENT:

System load management statistics can be returned to the Host CPU 
for purposes of managing overloads. The R3D/PRO-1000 can operate 
in three modes: 
ÿÿÿWorkstation Mode: non-real-time; the R3D/PRO-1000 renders the imagery 
ÿÿÿuntil completion. 
ÿÿÿFrame Lock Mode: the R3D/PRO-1000 maintains the specified 30 or 
ÿÿÿ60 Hz update rate regardless of the impact on displayed scene 
ÿÿÿquality. 
ÿÿÿOverload Protect Mode: the R3D/PRO-1000 drops back to half the 
ÿÿÿupdate rate when an overload condition is encountered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYSTEM FEATURES:


NUMBER OF DYNAMIC MODELS:

Up to 4095 simultaneous dynamic coordinate systems can be present 
in the system. 
ANIMATION:

Real-time animation effects are supported by allowing the Host CPU 
to cycle through pre-stored versions of dynamic models. 
FOG IMPLEMENTATION:

Per-pixel range is used, along with a fog density coefficient, to 
calculate a percentage of visibility range value. This value is then 
applied to a fading attenuation curve to calculate a per-pixel contrast 
adjustment. 
CLOUD DECKS:

Cloud decks are provided by textured layers which are located at 
any altitude desired. Terrain and 3-D objects may interpenetrate 
the cloud decks, and will be properly anti-aliased. Programmable 
visibility is available inside the cloud layer. 
HEIGHT ABOVE TERRAIN:

The R3D/PRO-1000 does not inherently calculate height above terrain. 
Lockheed Martin can offer advice on integrating this feature into 
the Host CPU. 
COLLISION DETECTION:

The R3D/PRO-1000 does not inherently calculate collision detection. 
Lockheed Martin can offer advice on integrating this feature into 
the Host CPU. 
LINE OF SIGHT RANGING:

The system can be directed to report the depth (Z) to any point as 
defined by its pixel location. This feature can accurately detect 
when a portion of a polygon has been declared translucent by virtue 
of its texturing, and instead report the range to the closest opaque 
polygon beyond. This method relies on locating the LOS within the 
field of view of a display channel. Range is reported with 22-bit 
floating point accuracy (six bits exponent, 16 bits mantissa). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SURFACE EFFECTS:


TRANSPARENCY:

Translucent polygons are available. Thirty-two levels of transparency 
can be assigned. Pixel processing load is increased by each translucent 
layer, as each one causes a pixel visit. Translucency can be invoked 
as a polygon attribute for LOD blending, or per-pixel based on the 
texture map contents. 
LUMINOUS POLYGONS:

Luminous polygons are available. Luminous polygons have modifiers 
to the range fading function to ensure these polygons realistically 
"poke through the haze." 
SWITCH CONTROLS:

Light and polygon intensities can be controlled via Host CPU manipulation 
of the color tables. 
COLORS AVAILABLE:

There are two color tables with 4096 entries each available on-line. 
These color tables define the RGB components of each entry. The color 
table addresses are defined in the polygon data in the database. 
The color RGB definitions may be modified in real-time if required 
by the simulation. 

Several tables can be made available for loading as required to define 
changing times of day or weather conditions which occur during the 
course of a simulation such as day, night, dusk, snow, wet, ice, 
and temperature for thermal sensor simulation. 
SURFACE MATERIALS:

Return of surface material information is not inherently provided 
by the R3D/PRO-1000. 
SHADING:

The following types of polygon shading are available: 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿFlat polygon shading is available and any polygon can be shaded 
ÿÿÿbased on the real-time sun vector and ambient lighting parameters. 
ÿÿÿFlat polygon shading can be used alone or in combination with 
ÿÿÿone of the available texture capabilities on either terrain or 
ÿÿÿ3-D models. 
ÿÿÿFixed shading is available for polygons which are not affected 
ÿÿÿby sun or ambient illumination. 
ÿÿÿCurved surface (Gouraud) shading is available and any polygon can 
ÿÿÿbe shaded based on the real-time sun vector and ambient lighting. 
ÿÿÿCurved surface (Gouraud) shading can be used alone or in combination 
ÿÿÿwith one of the available texture capabilities on 3-D models. 
ÿÿÿ
ÿÿÿSpecular shading is available and any polygon can be shaded based 
ÿÿÿon the real-time sun vector and ambient lighting. A polygon may 
ÿÿÿbe simultaneously flat shaded and specular shaded. 

Shading does not impact the polygon processing capacity of the system. 

SENSOR SIMULATION:

The R3D/PRO-1000 does not inherently provide sensor simulation, other 
than providing separate color tables per channel. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

MODELING TOOLS:

Open system design features permit 3rd party software developers 
to port popular run-time and database development tools, such as 
Gemini Technology Corporation's popular GVS&#174 package, to the 
R3D/PRO-1000 platform for supercharged real-time graphics performance. 
GVS supports many industry standard database formats, including MultiGen 
Flight&#174 , Wavefront&#174 , Alias&#174 , Softimage&#174 , and 
3D Studio&#174 . Current GVS applications will port to the R3D/PRO-
1000 with minimal effort, thus creating genuine cross-platform independence 
and an open system approach to teal-time image generation. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
