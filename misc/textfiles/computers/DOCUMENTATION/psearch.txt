     Introduction
     ------------

     PSEARCH lets you easily locate lost or forgotten files on hard
     disks or diskettes.  Since hard disk technology has made 70, 80,
     150 megabyte, and larger hard disks commonplace, users keep more
     information than ever stored in their PC systems.  It is not
     uncommon for users to have over 2000 files on their hard disks.
     This proliferation of files makes it very difficult to store files
     with names and directory structures that can be easily remembered
     and retrieved when files are later needed.

     When you need to find a file on your disk but do not know its
     filename or even directory, you most always know something unique
     about this file. If not, you would probably not be searching for
     it.  This unique information might me a person's name, a product
     name, a type of process, or even a location.  Whatever it is,
     PSEARCH can take this information and use it to search all files on
     the disk to identify one or more files that contain this unique
     data.

     Since PSEARCH can reduce your search from a list of 2000 files to
     just a few files, your job of locating a file becomes effortless.
     Quick examination of a few files easily lets you know if the
     desired file is on your disk.

     PSEARCH users have saved thousands of dollars in time searching for
     files, and time that would have been used to recreate lost files.
     PSEARCH becomes a invaluable tool for all hard disk users.

     PSEARCH goes farther than searching for data. Once files are found,
     you can automatically invoke other DOS programs and utilities to
     process them.  PSEARCH becomes a powerful driver for other programs.

     In addition to being flexible, PSEARCH is fast!  Our review of
     available text search utilities showed PSEARCH to be the best
     performer.  Our advanced search algorithm combined with
     flexible selection and exclusion criteria insure PSEARCH can
     find your files in the fastest possible time.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     PSEARCH has functions and features that make it useful in many
     different situations.  After reviewing this documentation and use
     PSEARCH, we are confident you will find a permanent place for it in
     your arsenal of tools.

     Here are a list of some of the many possible uses for PSEARCH.

     **   List all files on a hard disk that match a wildcard
          specification.

     **   Show the names of any files containing specified text

     **   Show text lines of any file containing a specified string.

     **   Look for word "Mrs" in any file and preserve case in search.

     **   Find 123 files containing the word "BUDGET" and print their name.

     **   Compile all C programs that refer to the "RECDESC.H" include
          file.

     **   Find a word processing document containing the name "Wiffle".

     **   Delete any *.DOC files containing "To: Mr. Johnson".

     **   Locate all readonly files existing on a disk.

     **   List all files updated today.

     **   Build a DOS command to archive manually selected files from one
          or more directories.

     **   Search multiple drives attached to the system for text or a file
          name

     **   Search for a file name even if it has been archived into .ZIP,
          .ARC or .LZH formats.

     **   Limit text search to WORDS, PREFIXES, or SUFFIXES. This greatly
          enhances the search by returning only the data you want.

     **   Ability to exclude files from the search process to greatly
          improve search performance.

     Using PSEARCH
     -------------

     PSEARCH may be executed directly from the DOS prompt or using menus
     that guide you through the process of entering search
     specifications.  Both techniques use the same 'PS' command. PSEARCH
     determines the difference in modes by the presence or absence of
     command line parameters.  When no command parameters are used, menu
     operation is selected.


     Using PSEARCH Menu Mode
     -----------------------

     To start PSEARCH using the menu mode, enter the PS command at the
     DOS prompt and press the <Enter> key.  The following menu will
     be displayed...

                             PSEARCH Main Menu


     The PSEARCH menu provides entry to PSEARCH processing.  Menu items
     may be selected by using an highlight bar positioned over the first
     menu item when PSEARCH is started.  Use the cursor arrow keys to
     move the the highlight bar to the function desired and press the
     <Enter> key to start the action.  You may quickly select any item
     by pressing the key relating to the first character of the menu
     item.  For example, press <N> to start a file name search.


     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page  4
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Following is a description of each menu item:

     Text Search.  Activates PSEARCH's text search facility.  You will
                   be presented with a entry menu to allow you to enter
                   specifications PSEARCH is to use to search for data.

                   Text Search is PSEARCH's ability to search within
                   files to find specific text.  It allows you to
                   automatically scan you systems disks to locate files
                   containing specific data contents.  For example, you
                   can find all files on the system that contain the
                   name 'Jones'.

     Name Search.  Activates the Name search facility.  Name search
                   allows you to use PSEARCH to locate files on your
                   system by the contents of their file names.

                   The DIR command provied with DOS only allows you to
                   locate files within any one single directory.  When
                   you have many directories and maybe even multiple
                   hard disks, it becomes impracticle to use the DIR
                   command to locate a file when you do not know what
                   directory it exists in.

                   PSEARCH name search can automatically search all
                   directories and even all disk devices to find a
                   specific or pattern file name.

     Help          PSEARCH's command line help provides very complete
                   help information on all of PSEARCH's facilities. The
                   help is provided primarily for those that want to use
                   PSEARCH's command line mode of operation but is
                   useful for all to use as a quick reference of
                   PSEARCH's abilities.

                   PSEARCH help consists of several pages of scrollable
                   data.  When you exit the help, you will be returned
                   to PSEARCH's main menu.

     Exit to DOS.  You may exit PSEARCH menu mode by either selecting
                   the Exit menu item or by simply pressing the <ESCAPE>
                   key from menu mode.

                   Upon exiting, PSEARCH will display how long it has
                   been active and provide a summary of its results.

     Special Editing Functions
     -------------------------

     Special edit functions are provided to enhance your capability
     to specify DOS pathname and text specifications.  These following
     features are available on all specification entry screens.

        Field Edit  --  You are presented with pathname and text
                        specifications from prior executions on the
                        parameter input displays.  You may use the
                        shown value by simply pressing <Enter>.

                        You may change the value by first pressing a
                        field edit key such as left or right cursor
                        arrow, <INS>, or <DEL>.  Then you may edit
                        the field as desired.

                        Entering any other value causes the current

     The top and bottom portion of the output display are reserved for
     statistical information to keep you aware of what PSEARCH is
     searching during processing.  The center portion of the display
     shows the data found that matches the search specifications.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 10
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     For each found text match, PSEARCH displays the file name and data
     matching the search criteria.  The filename is shown on a line
     before the matching text.  This line also shows the date and time
     the file was last updated or created and the size of the file in
     characters. If DOS attributes are present in the DOS directory
     entry for the file, they are also shown.

     PSEARCH Command Line Mode
     -------------------------

     The following section describes the use PSEARCH using command
     line specifications.  These specifications all you to enter
     all PSEARCH options directly on the PSEARCH command when it is
     entered to DOS.  Although more difficult to master, the command
     line mode is the easiest and fastest to use once you learn how
     to use PSEARCH.


     Command Parameters
     ------------------

     Command parameters control PSEARCH's may different features when it
     is use in command line mode at the DOS prompt. They are easy to
     understand and learn, and provide you need to quickly locate all
     files. Remember that each parameter is summarized in the online
     help display. Just type PS at the DOS promot.


     COMMAND FORMAT:

     PS [fspec] /T:text /F /S /C /P /PR /PF /MO /O:nn/N:nn /NW /TA
                /X[F][P]:cmd /AT:c /FW /FP /FS /DR:xxx /SO /AR /AO


     PS - PS is the name of the PSEARCH command.
     PS actually refers to Patriquin's PSEARCH. Enter the command without
     any parameters for menus and help.

     [fspec]
           Enter the DOS file specification for the directory and file
           names to be searched. If no directory name is specified the
           current directory will be searched. If the /S option is
           specified, the directory name portion of this parameter is
           not used.

           Like DOS, use the '*' to indicate the last part of a filename
           or filename extension may be any set of characters.  Also
           like DOS, use the '?' to indicate that any single position of
           a filename may be any character.

           In addition to DOS, you may place an '*' anywhere in the
           filename to indicate any set of characters may exist in this
           point in the name.


     SPECIAL FLEX FILENAME SEARCHING CONTROL CHARACTERS

           The filename specification may contain a full DOS pathname
           including the standard DOS wildcard characters * and ?. In
           addition the special characters '~', '!', or ';' may be
           placed immediately before the filename to specify special
           filename find criteria.

             8.    !WD*.*
             9.    ~WORD.*

     SPECIFY A LIST OF FILES TO BE SEARCHED

            As an alternative, a file containing a list of input files may
            be supplied.  Create  a file containing lines  with a filename
            or complete pathname on  each line.  Provide  this filename as
            the source filename to PSEARCH and add an @ character before the
            name.  The list of files will be processed as if they were all
            specified on the input command line.

            For file list processing,  PSEARCH understands the output of the
            DOS DIR command.   You may use the  DOS redirection feature to
            direct DIR output  to a file, edit  the file to add  or remove
            entries,  and  then  provide this  to  PSEARCH  as  input.   For
            example:

            DIR \TURBOC\C\*.C > FILE.LST
            PSEARCH @FILE.LST /T:TEXT

     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     /AO   Archive type files Only - If you have files on your system
           that are compressed into archive files with DOS extension
           names of .ZIP, .ARC, or .LZH, PSEARCH is to search only these
           files. This parameter is only useful for file name searching.
           PSEARCH does not decompress these file contents for text
           search requests.

           When specified, this parameter specifies that all archive
           files are to be internally searched for filenames compressed
           in them that meed the specified file specification.

           Note, you do not specify .ARC, .ZIP, or .LZH in the PSEARCH
           file specification.  PSEARCH will automatically find and
           search these files.


     /AR   ARchive type files as well as normal files -  PSEARCH will
           search both archive files and non-archive files for matching
           filename specifications.  Use only for file name searches.
           (See also the /AO command parameter).


     /AT:c ATtributes - Specifies that PSEARCH is to search for files
           having one or more of the attributes specified by the /AT:
           parameter.

                U - Updated,the ARCHIVE bit is on to indicate the file
                    has been updated since the last backup.

                R - Readonly,Files marked with Readonly attribute.

                H - Hidden,Files marked with Hidden attribute.

                S - System, Files marked with System attribute.

           Use /AT:U to locate all files that have been updated since
           your last backup was done.

           Use /AT:H to determine what hidden files exist on your
           disks.


     /C Case - Indicates that text search requests are to be case
           sensitive.  That is, exact upper/lower case searching
           will be done.

           Normally it is easier to let PSEARCH find text data
           regardless of its case.  This allows you to be sure to find
           any possible matches.

           Exact case searching is useful for those cases where you know
           the text is specified in an exact way.  It potentially
           reduces the number of false matches that may be encountered
           during the search.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     /DR:  DRive list. If the drive is not specified in the main
           pathname, PSEARCH will search the current disk device. /DR:
           indicates one or more drives that the search is to be
           performed on. The following example indicates the search is
           to be done on drives C and D.

               /DR:cd

           The drive list is especially useful for searching all drives
           on a system containing multiple hard disks.  Specify this
           parameter in the PSEARCH= environment variable to force it to
           be in effect for all command line executions.


     /DS   Directory path search.  Normally PSEARCH will search only the
           current directory or the entire disk of /S is also specified.
           The /DS parameter indicates PSEARCH is to search the
           specified or current directory and all of its subordinate
           directories for files.

           This parameter is useful for those system that have well
           structured hard disk directories.  For example, PSEARCH can
           easily search all word processing directories if all these
           directories are subordinate to a single high level directory
           name.

           If you have a directory structure like the following...

               C:\                    Root directory
               C:\WPSYS\              Word processing system files
               C:\WP\                 Word processing data files
               C:\WP\PLANNING\        Planning documents
               C:\WP\MEMOS\           Memos
               C:\WP\STANDARD\        Polocies and Procedures

           Use the following PSEARCH command to search for all documents
           containing the text "emergency"...

               PS C:\WP\*.*/t:emergency/ds

           Only the word processing document files will be searched.
           All other directories on your hard disk will be ignored.

     /EX   Exclude files.  Primarily intended for text search requests,
           the exclude facility allows you to provide a list of pathname
           and filename specifications that are to be excluded from
           PSEARCH processing.  Since searching through data on your
           hard disk requires extensive processing and disk read time,
           excluding files from the process will save you time, and will
           reduce the number of false matches displayed for your
           requests.

           The most common files to exclude from text search processing
           is product program and control files.  These files constitute
           a large portion of your hard disk's used space and
           unnecessarily lengthen the time it takes searches to locate
           the desired data.

           The exclude facility is implemented with two actions.  First,
           you will need to create an exclude specification file and
           place it in the same directory where PSEARCH is installed on
           your hard disk.  This file will contain the names of all the
           files and paths to be excluded.  You may specify DOS pattern
           names to exclude groups of files with a single specification.

           Like DOS, use the '*' to indicate the last part of a filename
           or filename extension may be any set of characters.  Also
           like DOS, use the '?' to indicate that any single position of
           a filename may be any character.

           In addition to DOS, two additional pattern features are
           available.  You may place an '*' anywhere in the filename to
           indicate any set of characters may exist in this point in the
           name.  For pathnames, you may place an '**' at the end of a
           directory path specification to indicate the specification
           applies to the specified directory and all subordinate
           directories.  Using '**', you can exclude an entire path with
           a single specification.

           You must tell PSEARCH what you want selected for search, and
           what you want excluded.  PSEARCH supports both of these, making
           use of the SEL and EXC commands.  Placing a SEL in front of the
           filename or pattern tells PSEARCH to select that file, while
           putting an EXC tells PSEARCH to exclude it.  If nothing is
           specified, PSEARCH assumes EXC.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 16
     --------------------------------------------------------------------


           Following are examples:

             1.    EXC *.EXE
             2.    *.COM
             3.    EXC TEST*.*
             4.    EXC *TEST*.*
             5.    EXC DO?FIX.*
             6.    ESC PC*XX.*
             7.    EXC C:\DOS\*.*
             8.    EXC \TEST\*.*
             9.    EXC D:\GAMES**\*.*
             10    SEL TEST.XXX
             11    SEL FIND.EXE

           Explanations for the above examples:
             1.  Excludes all filenames with the extension .EXE from
                 processing.

             2.  Excludes all filenames ending with extension .COM.

             3.  Excludes all filenames beginning with the letters
                 "TEST" from processing.

             4.  Excludes all filenames having the characters "TEST"
                 anywhere in the first portion of the filename.

             5.  Exclude files having 'DO' as the first 2 characters of
                 the filename, and 'FIX' as the 4th, 5th, and 6th
                 filename characters.  The 3rd character of the filename
                 may be any character.

             6.  Exclude files having a name beginning with the 2
                 characters PC and where the first portion of the
                 filename ends with the characters 'XX'.  Any 0 to 4
                 characters may exist between the 'PC' and 'XX' in the
                 first portion of the filename.

             7.  Exclude all files from the DOS directory on drive C:.

             8.  Exclude all files from the TEST directory existing
                 on any drive searched.

             9.  Exclude all files from the D:\GAMES\ directory and
                 also exclude all files and directories subordinate
                 to the GAMES directory.

             10. Even though all files containing the word TEST are
                 excluded, using a SEL statment tells PSEARCH to search
                 just that filename or pattern.

             11. Same concept as above.  Even though all the *.EXE files
                 are excluded, the SEL statement forces PSEARCH to look
                 in that file.

           Exclude file names --

              Since you may want to exclude different files from
              file find and text search requests, a different
              exclude file name exists for each.

                 PSEARCHF.EXC  --  File Find exclude specifications
                 PSEARCHT.EXC  --  Text Search exclude specifications

              These files may be created using most any word processor
              or text editor.  If you have no word processor or editor
              you may use the EDLIN text editor provided with your DOS
              system.

              The exclude files must exist in the same directory the
              PS.EXE file is located on.  PS.EXE is the name of the
              PSEARCH program file.

           Activating exclude --

              Exclude will only be functional when the /EX command
              parameter is specified.  When /EX is specified, you must
              have a valid exclude file.  PSEARCH will not continue
              without one.  If you wish exclude to be active during all
              executions, specify /EX as part of the PSEARCH= DOS
              environment variable.  See later in the documentation for
              a description of this feature.


     /F    Find File in the current directory.  Normally PSEARCH will
           search all directories to find a file.  Use the /F parameter
           to limit PSEARCH to search only the specified or current
           directory.


     /FP   Find Prefix - (use with /T:) Indicates that matching text
           must be at the end of an existing word.  Designed primarily
           for word searches, find prefix qualifies the search to help
           you find exactly the match you want.


     /FS   Find Suffix - (use with /T:) Works like find prefix, except
           finds the matching text only if it preceeds an existing word.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 18
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     /FW   Find Word - (use with /T:) The text to be searched for is a
           word. Only select text that is a complete word. A word is
           defined as any string of characters and numbers that is not
           preceded or succeeded with other characters or numbers.

           In "This", "This" is a word. "is" is not a word.  A search
           like    PS *.*/t:is/fw   would show matches for is but will
           not match on the "is" characters in "this".


     /L    Line numbers.  When you are searching DOS text files for
           specific text (/T: parm used), use the /L parameter when you
           want PSEARCH to determine and display the number of the line
           associated with the text displayed.

           DOS text files are those files that have a carriage return
           and line feed at the end of each line of text.  A good
           example of these is DOS batch command files (*.BAT).  Word
           processing files often do not use this format and so line
           number specifications are not often useful for them.


     /N:nnn Newdays - Indicates that only files created or updated
           within the last nnn days are to be selected for processing.
           /N:1 causes any files updated within the last day to be
           selected. To search for files updated on the current date,
           specify /N:0.


     /ND   No Data.  For text searches, PSEARCH normally displays the
           text data lines for matching data found in files searched.
           If you only need the filenames shown, use the /ND parameter
           to deactivate the text display.


     /NM   No Multiples.  For text search specifications, causes
           PSEARCH to only search for a single matching text
           in any file and displays only one match.  Other matches
           may exist in the file.


     /NO   No mOre - Normally PSEARCH will stop at the end of each full
           display of lines.  You may press <ESCAPE> to terminate
           processing, <C> to disable more and display without stopping
           again, or press any other key to display another page of the
           display and stop again.  /NO disables this feature.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 19
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     /NM   Use of the /NM parameter will shorten your display of
           output and may improve search performance by stopping
           the search of a file after a single match is shown.


     /NW   No Windows.  PSEARCH normally operates in full screen
           window mode.  To deactivate this feature and DISplay all
           output in normal DOS line mode specify this parameter.

           The /NW parameter causes PSEARCH to use BIOS type screen
           writes to display output to the display.  The /NW parameter
           may be useful when you have special devices or TSR's
           active that screen or capture output going through these
           interfaces.

     /NP   Suppress ALL PSEARCH output.


     /O:nnn Olddays - Indicates that only files older than nnn days are
           to be selected for processing. /O:365 will cause files over
           one year old to be selected.


     /P    Pause - Pause  PSEARCH will pause whenever a match of
           filename or text in a file is found. You may terminate the
           search or continue by pressing any key.


     /PF   Print to File - If you want to direct print to an output
           file, enter /PR. The file PSPRINT.DAT will be created in the
           current directory.  The resulting file may be edited or
           viewed using your current word processor, text editor, or the
           DOS TYPE command.


     /PR   PRint - Causes all screen output to also be directed to the
           output printer device.  This allows you to have a printed
           record of PSEARCH results.


     /R:nnn  Near specification for multiple text searches.  You may use
           the /R parameter when you have also specified multiple /T:
           parameters to cause PSEARCH to search for multiple sets of
           text.  /R specifies a number of characters that may exist
           between the first characters of the text to be searched.  In
           other words, the text will only be considered a match if it
           is within n characters of all other text specified.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 20
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

           Use the /R when you want to find values related to one
           another and know the values will exist within close proximity
           of each other in the file.  The following example will search
           files for the name 'Jones' and will identify a letter to this
           person by indicating the search is only to search for the
           name 'jones' when it also exists near the letter salutation
           'Dear'.  The /R:50 value indicates the two values must be
           within 50 characters of each other in the file.

                PS *.*/t:jones/t:near/r:50/ta


     /RT   Related text.  During text searches /RT will cause PSEARCH
           to attempt to display up to 10 lines of text related to the
           matching text being shown.  In many cases, less than 10
           lines of text may be shown when PSEARCH detects unprintable
           data or changes in paragraph structure.

           When /RT is specified, each display of matched text will be
           separated by horizontal bar lines to help you better see the
           groups of text being displayed.


     /S    System - Indicates that all directories on all hard disk
           drives are to be searched.  If a directory or drive is
           specified as part of the pathname, only it will be searched.


     /SO   Turns the PSEARCH signal sounds off.


     /T:text to be searched
           Text - Specifies the text to be found for text search
           requests. The text string may contain any characters. A
           terminating command line or the following slash character
           will signal the end of the text to be searched. If this is
           the last parameter on the command any trailing spaces will
           not be included in the search. To include trailing spaces,
           terminate the string with an ending slash character.

           Text may be specified in upper or lower case. Unless the /C
           parameter is specified to force exact text matches, the
           search will be made for any match regardless of case.

           Strings may also be single or double quoted. This allows for
           special characters to be included in the search string such
           as / characters.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 21
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

           Examples:

            /T:BUDGET /T:Budget /T:Mr.  Jones/
            /T:"01/01/88"

           Note, to include a trailing space as part of search text, you
           must follow search text by another / command parameter. For
           example:

            PS *.C/T: SMITH /TA

           Up to five (5) /T: parameter specifications may be included
           for text search requests.  This allows PSEARCH to search for
           five different texts on a single search of a disk or
           directory. When multiple text is specified, consider the use
           of the /TA parameter to force PSEARCH to find all text in a
           single file before considering the file a match.

           The /T: parameter serves the purpose of indicating to PSEARCH
           of the search is to be for text in a file or for file names.
           Any command line execution of PSEARCH without the /T:
           parameter will cause PSEARCH to assume the request is to
           locate files by name only.


     /TA   Text 'AND'.  Used for mutiple text searches.  Indicates
           that all text must be found in the file for a PSEARCH
           to display a match.  Without /TA specified, any matching
           text will be displayed.


     /X:xxx eXecute - Build and execute a DOS command whenever a
           filename match or a text match is found. xxx is the DOS
           command to be executed.

           The command may either be a standard DOS command or the name
           of a DOS batch command file. The command will be executed
           with a second copy of COMMAND.COM. The command data may
           contain the following special characters to allow for
           substitution values.

              # - Always replaced with the selected filename

              & - Always replaced with the selected path/filename

              ! - Always replaced with the filename without extension

              @ - Replaced with a slash to allow for command parameters
                  to be specified in executed commands.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 22
     --------------------------------------------------------------------


           Examples:

              /X:ERASE &To delete selected files
              /X:ARC A OLD123.ARC # To use ARC utility to archive
                                    file
              /X:TYPE & To type the file
              /X:LOTUS Start 123 for the file


     /XF:xxx eXecute File - Works like /X except that the command is not
           executed, it is generated and placed in a DOS batch command
           file named PSCMDS.BAT in the current directory. This file may
           be edited before it is executed.


     /XP:xxx eXecute with Pause - Functions in the same way as the /X
           parameter except that you are asked to indicate if the
           command is to be executed for each selected file.


     Specification of default parameters
     -----------------------------------

     Default parameters are parameters that do not need to be specified
     each time PSEARCH is started. Any PSEARCH parameter may be
     specified as a default parameter.

     Use the DOS SET command to specify the parameter name and contents
     to be used by PSEARCH each time it is started. The following
     example indicates the /EX exclude parameter specification is to be
     automatically provided to PSEARCH each time it is used in the
     command mode.

       SET PSEARCH=/D/M

     Once this DOS command is issued, each subsequent use of PSEARCH
     will operate as if these parameters have been specified on the
     command line. The SET command is most commonly placed in the
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file so it may be in effect every time your machine is
     started.

     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Screen colors and monitor support
     ---------------------------------

     PSEARCH checks the DOS equipment flags to determine what type of
     monitor you have on your system. This is usually always correct
     except for one specific information. For those users running a
     composite monitor with a color graphics card, the screens may not
     be displayed correctly. If this occurs, use the DOS MODE command to
     set your environment to black and white. This can be done at system
     startup or just before starting PSEARCH. Beware that some
     applications incorrectly reset these indicators and they may need
     to be reset before again running PSEARCH. Following is an example,
     see the DOS reference for more information about setting the
     monitor with the MODE command.

        DOS MODE command example ===>  MODE BW80


     Pausing the Search
     ------------------

     Even if the Pause parameter is not specified, you may pause the
     search at any time by pressing any keyboard key. At the end of the
     next process PSEARCH will pause. You will then have the opportunity
     to continue processing, use a function key, or exit from PSEARCH.

                                                                             |
      To encourage users to register, the following "bonus" features are
      made available only to registered users.  When you register your
      use of this utility by completing the registration form and
      sending it in with the requested fee, you will soon receive
      special codes to unlock these bonus features for your use.  These
      unlocking codes will work for the current and all future versions
      of the utility.

      I apologize for having to implement locked out features, but after
      5 years of experience of developing Shareware it is clear that
      most users will not register utility software without having
      something to encourage them. The bonus features provide a small
      reward for those who do take the time to register.
                                                                             |
       /RT - Ability to show related text for search matches
       /PR - Direct display output to the line printer
       /PF - Direct display output to a print file
       /SO - Turn off the sound
       /DR: - Multiple drive support is limited to 2 drives

     Program Maintenance History
     ---------------------------

     There is an ongoing commitment to improve PSEARCH as long as there
     is expressed need by PSEARCH users. I do respond to your requests.
     The enhancements below reflect both user requests and my own ideas.
     Please let me know of your needs, maybe they can appear on this
     list in the future.

     ------------------------------------------------------------------

     Version 1.0      March 1, 1986
          --  PSEARCH Version 1.0 was released in March 1st, 1986

     Version 2.0      April 8, 1986
          PSEARCH Version 2.0 was released April 8th, 1986. It
              upgraded version 1 with the following new features.

          -- Ability to search in .ARC files for filenames /AR /AO
          -- Find text by WORD, PREFIX, or SUFFIX /FW /FP /FS
          -- Returns back to menus after search is complete
          -- Extract data to file implemented
          -- Fix to show found text un upper/lower case
          -- /SO to turn sound off
          -- Ability to exclude .COM and .EXE files from search
          -- Ability to search all drives attached to system /DR:abc

     Version 3.0      September 7, 1986
          PSEARCH Version 3.0 was released Sept. 7th, 1986. It upgraded
          version 2 with the following new features.

          -- Sound alike and other new filespec wildcards (! ; ~).
          -- More menu options on the Peak menu.
          -- Correction to retrieve proper environment string to be used
             when executing DOS commands.

     Version 3.3      July 5, 1987
          -- Change registration so there is no longer a need to have
             the PSEARCH.REG file exist in the root directory.

          -- Text searches will not attempt to search .ARC files. Since
             these files are compressed it makes no sense to search them
             for text.

          -- Use environment field PS= to specify default command
             parameters.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 25
     --------------------------------------------------------------------

     Version 3.4      September 16, 1987

          -- Ignore ~ ! and ; filename search characters unless they are
             in the first position of the filename. Previous versions
             file searches would fail if these characters were found in
             any position but the first.

          -- Correct filename matching. If file XXX would not be found
             if pattern name of XXX.* was specified.

          -- When print option was used with menus, when processing
             completed, menu text was printed to the printer. Corrected.


     Version 3.8      March 1, 1988

          -- Add ability to accept " or ' quoted strings in text search
             input command data. This is for the /T: parameter only.


     Version 4.0      February 22,1990

          This version is essentially a rewrite of the original PSEARCH
          facility.  All the changes are too numerous to mention.
          Following is a list of the most significant changes.

          Enhancements...
          -- Add ability to search up to 5 text strings
          -- AND/OR capability on text strings
          -- New exclude file allows user to specify file names
          -- New menu structure
          -- Near parameter to force multiple text matches to be within
             n characters of each other.
          -- /NW implements no window mode for those that need or prefer
             DOS style displays.
          -- /DS parameter allows a single directory path including all
             subordinate directories to be searched.
          -- The limit of the number of directories that can be searched
             greatly enhanced.  The maximum number of directories is
             related to the amount of free memory available to PSEARCH.

          Items removed...
          -- The Peak feature has been removed.
          -- The 5 text strings replaces the ability to specify a ?
             in the text search string.
          -- The exclude file replaces the /SK command to skip
             .COM and .EXE files.

     PSEARCH Users Guide/Reference    Copyright 1991 Patri-Soft   Page 26
     --------------------------------------------------------------------
     Version 4.1      February 26, 1990
          -- System lockup during speaker beeps.  Also improper beeps.
          -- Set sounds off as default
          -- Set pause at full screen (more) as default in command mode

     Version 4.2      March 9, 1990
          -- Added /RT parm to show related text
          -- Added field edit capabilities.
          -- Removed more line from display after user pressed a key
          -- Replaced /MO with /NO.  More was made default.

     Version 4.3      May 4, 1990
          -- Corrected errors encountered when processing .ZIP files
             containing directory names as well as filenames.
          -- Corrected problem where PSEARCH ignored the drive
             specification for the path to be searched.
          -- Added directory name to filename display on search display
          -- Added a screen of condensed help.
          -- Improved screen I/O performance
          -- Removed requirement to place quotes around text to be
             searched for in command line.  You may now search for
             data containing spaces.
                 PS *.TXT/T:Joe Doe
          -- File find now searches all hard disk drives unless a
             specific drive is specified.
          -- /S parameter causes all hard disk drives to be scanned
             unless a specific drive is specified in the supplied
             pathname.

     Version 4.4a     July 11, 1990
          -- When PS *.exe/DS used.  The same directory was searched
             3 times.  This only happened when directory had no
             subdirectories.  PS was fixed to scan the directory once.
          -- For network operation  -- added auto skipping of any files
             DOS denied access to.  A message is printed for each file
             that is bypassed.
          -- Detect bad exclude file specifications and stop processing.
             Processing used to continue but not select any files.
          -- PSEARCH was searching all directories for a file even when
             a specific pathname was specified.  The search is now
             limited to just the specified pathname.
          -- Support multiple drive parameter (/DR:) when directory name
             specified.  Allows multiple drives to be searched for a
             single directory name.
          -- PS *.* /AT:u stopped displaying output when readonly,
             hidden, system, updated file displayed.
          -- Added [=blank and ]=\ to /X: command substitution
     Version 4.4c  December 17, 1990
          -- Added capability to specify a list of files to be searched
             on the command line using the "@" symbol.
          -- Added the /NP (No Print) parameter
          -- Enhanced the .EXC file to be able to process SELect and EXClude
             statements.
     Version 4.4D
          -- Fixed problem with registration info not displayed.
     Version 4.4E
          -- When PSEARCH.DAT found during file search IN ARCHIVES,
             program locked up.
          -- /X: parm did not work in /NW mode.  DOS returned Bad command
             or filename.
          -- A couple little comsmetics.
          -- If a corrupted .ZIP file was encounterd, PS crashed.  Now skips
             the file.

        Registering The Utilities
        -------------------------

        PSEARCH is distributed under the Shareware concept. This allows
        users to evaluate software for a short time to determine if it
        is useful to them.  If you decide the software is of value to
        you and decide to keep and use, you are required to register it.

        This concept allows for quality software to be distributed at a
        reasonable cost.  Hundreds of hours of my time has been invested
        in PSEARCH.  Continued registration will justify the continued
        upgrading of this utility to insure it remains up to date with
        current technology.  In any case, I do greatly appreciate all
        users that care enough to register.  I try to provide the best
        possible software for all you faithful supporting users.

        You may use the order form on the next page when registering.

        Send registration requests to:

                  Patri-Soft
                  P.O. Box 8263
                  San Bernardino, CA   92412

        The registration charge is a one time fee that entitles you to
        all future versions of the product.  These may either be
        obtained from normal Shareware sources or from me.  I do not
        automatically  send product updates to registered users.  It is
        impossible to provide automatic upgrades at the low costs of
        these utilities.  If you would like to receive the next version
        of the software, add an additional $15 to your order and
        indicate on the order form you wish to receive the next update
        version.  You will be sent the next version along with an
        optional order form to request subsequent releases.

   Site licensing plans for one or more Patriquin utilities:
   ---------------------------------------------------------

               1.   Site licensing fees are as follows:

                    The  first  five  copies  of  any  or all utilities are
                    purchased  at  full  price.    If   all  utilities  are
                    purchased, printed  documentation is included for these
                    first 5 copies.

                    All  additional  copies  of  any  utility  or  complete
                    package are 1/3 off the normal price.

                    You  pay   a  maximum   of  $2000.00  to  register  any
                    individual utility or $4500.00  for all  utilities, for
                    an entire site.  This gives your installation rights to
                    copy and distribute the  utilities  to  anyone  at your
                    site.   This also  allows "at-home"  use of any utility
                    for any person at the site.

                    A site is a company location in one  city.   A location
                    in another city is considered a second site.

                    If a utility is placed on a LAN, each regular user of a
                    utility placed on the  LAN should  be registered.   Use
                    your own good judgement here.
