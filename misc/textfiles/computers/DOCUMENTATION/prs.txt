                            -------


   First of all,  thank you for considering our products.  We are 
committed to providing our customers with prompt answers to their 
questions and advice about the use of our products.  We encourage 
you to call us.


   It  has  been our experience that people learn how to use  new 
software products in many different ways.   Factors such as prior 
computer experience, time constraints, availability of help, ease 
of product,  etc.  will probably effect how you will learn to use 
the Police Records System.  Keeping in mind these differences, we 
have developed this manual, as well as the entire system, so that 
you may choose several different learning approaches.


   For  example,  if you have the time,  you might choose to read 
the  entire manual and then try the hands-on  demonstration.   Or 
you  might feel that the hands-on demonstration is not worthwhile 
and immediately begin to use the system.


   Another  approach would be to scan Sections A through D,  read 
the first subsection of Section E and then either read through or 
try the hands-on demonstration.  Since the functions described in 
Section E work virtually the same, you need only be familiar with 
one to understand the remainder.  This approach is the fastest.  


  Whatever approach you follow, we would recommend the following:


-  Don't skip Section D (HOW TO GET STARTED)

-  While reading Section E (HOW THE POLICE RECORDS SYSTEM  WORKS) 
   use Appendices D (SAMPLE REPORTS) & E (SAMPLE SCREENS) to help 
   you visualize what is going on.

-  Call us for answers to your questions.

Š     SECTION A.  WHAT IS THE POLICE RECORDS SYSTEM ?


First off,  let's refer to the Police Records System as 'PRS'.  

PRS  is  a  computer  software system  developed  to  assist  the 
"typical"   police  department to store and retrieve  information 
about  dispatch  calls,   warrants,  arrests,  criminal  history, 
firearms  and local residents.  PRS also provides a selection  of 
reports that you will find helpful.  


BUT WE'RE NOT A TYPICAL POLICE DEPARTMENT !   
 

That's right, no one seems to be and that's the problem with most 
computer software systems.   For example, if your department does 
not handle the registration of firearms, you won't have a need to 
record  such  details.   PRS has been developed so that  you  can 
choose  NOT  to use all of its functions...only those  that  make 
sense to you.
 
Other problems often encountered with software systems  developed  
for  the "typical" police department are that they may not  store 
information in a manner that you like or provide reports that you 
need.  In order to overcome such problems, MicroServices not only 
provides the details needed by computer programmers to modify PRS 
but  also  offers  a low-cost service to customize  PRS  to  your 
needs (refer to Appendix F for further details).


ARE WE TOO BIG (OR SMALL) TO USE PRS ?


Neither.   The  amount of information you plan to enter into  PRS 
will effect how much storage capacity you'll need.  If you have a 
question about your specific needs, please contact us.


WHAT TYPE OF COMPUTER EQUIPMENT DO I NEED TO RUN PRS ?

We recommend an IBM PC, AT or compatible with a hard disk and at 
least 256K of RAM, plus an 80 column printer. If you have another 
brand of computer, or a floppy disk system, please call and we'll 
discuss how you'll still be able to use PRS.









                             
                            1









Š        SECTION B.  DEFINITION OF TERMS



Some  terms  will be introduced in this manual that may be  unfa-
miliar.  A brief explanation of each is provided below:



BACKSPACE  KEY  - The BACKSPACE key is used to  make your  screen 
cursor  skip  backward on the screen.  It is located on  the  top 
righthand side of your keyboard.   It looks like a straight arrow 
pointing to the left (not to be confused with the slightly larger 
RETURN key just below).


COMMAND  - A command is an instruction the computer  understands.  
For example,  the message "IS THE ABOVE CORRECT ?  (Y/N)" may ap-
pear on your monitor.   If you enter "Y" or "N", you have entered 
a  command  that the computer will understand.   If you  were  to 
enter  "X",  for example,  the computer would not understand  you 
command.


CURSOR  - The  cursor generally appears as a  blinking  underline 
character  on  your  monitor where you are to  begin  entering  a 
command  or data.   Sometimes,  the cursor appears as a rectangle 
the size of an uppercase letter.


DATA INPUT -  Data is information.  Data input refers to entering 
information into a computerized file by using your keyboard.


FIELD - A field is a single piece of information about a specific 
topic.   For  example,  address is a single piece of  information 
about an individual.  In this case, address is but one field that 
helps to describe an individual.


FILE  - A file is a collection of records about a specific topic.  
For example, all your warrant records can be collected and stored 
in a file cabinet as well as a computer file.


FUNCTION  - A  function can be thought of as a task you  need  to 
perform.   PRS  currently supports 6 functions to help  you  with 
your  day-to-day tasks.   Please refer to Section E  for complete 
details.


HARDWARE - A general term that refers to all of the parts of your 
computer system...the keyboard,  monitor,  disk drives,  printer, 
etc.
                                
                               2









ŠMENU - A screen that lists functions that are available to you.


MONITOR  - One  of  several terms used to refer  to  the  TV-like 
screen  of your computer.   Also referred to as a terminal or CRT 
(Carthode Ray Tube).


RECORD  - A  record  is a collection of fields that  refer  to  a 
specific topic.  For example, name, address, height, weight, etc. 
combine to form a record about an individual.


RETURN KEY - The RETURN key is pressed when you want the computer 
to  acknowledge  your command or data input.   The RETURN key  is 
also known as the ENTER  key.  It's located on the righthand side 
of your keyboard.  It looks like a straight arrow pointing to the 
left,  bent upwards at the right end (not to be confused with the 
slightly smaller BACKSPACE key just above).


SCREEN  - A  screen refers to the video display you see  on  your 
monitor.


SOFTWARE  - A  general  term  that refers to  the "programs" that 
control your computer system.   A program is nothing more than  a 
set of commands that the computer can follow.

Š        SECTION C.  GENERAL OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS  



Whenever we attempt to use something new, it's a good practice to 
know how that something works.  When you purchased your computer, 
hopefully you received instructions as to how it works. With each
new piece of equipment and software product you've purchased, you 
also received operating instructions.   


Likewise,  PRS has a specific set of operating instructions  that 
you should become familiar with.   No, there's not alot to remem-
ber.   In fact,  as you use PRS you'll find most of the following 
operating instructions are obvious and comfortable for you.



OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS TO REMEMBER
----------------------------------


PRS is  a menu-based  system.    That means when you start PRS, a 
MASTER  MENU SCREEN will be displayed on your monitor that  lists 
all the functions available to you.  By entering the number  cor
responding  to the function,  PRS will display another screen  to 
carry out that function.


In turn,  many of these subsequent screens will ask you to choose 
WHAT  you  want to do.   These choices will always appear at  the 
bottom  of  your screen.  They are activated by your  typing  the 
letter  in parentheses that corresponds to what you want  to  do.  
Note  that  you can type the letter in upper or  lower  case,  it 
doesn't matter.


When  entering the number or letter that corresponds to what  you 
want  to do,  PRS will immediately respond to your  request...you 
are not required to then press the RETURN key.   


The  above convention contrasts with how you move from one  field 
to another on a PRS screen. When you are adding or changing field 
information,  you  must  press the RETURN key to 'skip' from  one 
field to the next.   The only exception is when you totally  fill 
the field with information, in which case, PRS will automatically 
move you to the next field.   


If  any screen field is not large enough to hold the  information 
you wish to store, please accept our apologies.  PRS was designed 
to  provide ample room for information,  but also with an eye  to 
efficiency.   You'll  need to abbreviate as best as possible,  or 
contact us about customizing your system.


                               4







ŠCertain  fields  will  only accept numbers as  data  input.   For 
example,  all PRS dates are expressed as MM/DD/YY.   Therefore, a 
valid date would be 01/31/84 for January 31,  1984.   If you  at
tempt  to  enter any other character,  PRS will refuse to  accept 
your entry.


Help screens are available at critical points within  PRS.   They 
appear  as  choices on the MASTER MENU SCREEN and  several  other 
screens.


All  screens will display messages at the bottom that prompt  you 
to take the appropriate action.


When  PRS detects a problem,  a brief explanation will appear  at 
the bottom of your screen.   Occasionally,  the explanation  will 
call  for an answer.   Most of the time,  you'll be told to press 
any key to continue the process.   If you're ever confused by the 
explanations, please refer to Section E  for additional details.


The  only true exit from PRS can be found as the last  choice  on 
the  MASTER MENU SCREEN.   The exit choices you'll see  in  other 
parts  of  PRS,  if chosen,  will return you to the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN.   In  effect,  the MASTER MENU SCREEN is a home base from 
which  you  venture to perform functions and always  return  when 
finished.


























                               5









Š              SECTION D.  HOW TO GET STARTED


Before  we get started,  please make at least one backup copy  of 
your PRS diskette.   If you're not sure how to do this,  refer to 
your DOS manual under the command COPY or DISKCOPY.
 

PRS has been designed to work on hard disk systems.   If you have 
a floppy disk system,  please call us to discuss the availability 
of PRS for your system.



HOW TO INSTALL PRS ON YOUR HARD DISK SYSTEM
-------------------------------------------


STEP  1.   Create a subdirectory called PRS on your hard disk.


STEP  2.   Place the PRS diskette in your 'A' drive and close
           the diskette drive door.  This diskette contains all
           the programs and master files that make PRS work.
        

STEP  3.   Copy the contents of the diskette to your subdirectory 
           with the following command:

           COPY A:*.* \PRS


STEP  4.   Go to the subdirectory, type 'PRS' and press the RETURN
           key.  You will be presented with the PRS logo screen.
           Press any key and the MASTER MENU SCREEN will be dis-
           played.  That's it !  You're now ready to put PRS to
           the test. 



If this is the first time you've seen the MASTER MENU SCREEN, you 
may want to exit the screen by simply typing '8' so that you  can 
review  Section E as well as the Appendix.   In fact,  a complete 
hands-on,  step-by-step  demonstration  of  PRS is  presented  in 
Appendix A.
              
                                








                               6Š









     SECTION E.  HOW THE POLICE RECORDS SYSTEM WORKS


As  previously  mentioned,  PRS was developed to  assist  in  the 
storage  and  retrieval  of  information  about  dispatch  calls, 
warrants, arrests, criminal history,firearms and local residents.  
PRS  also  provides  a selection of reports that  you  will  find 
helpful.   This section outlines the purpose of each PRS function 
and how it works.


Each  function will be discussed in the order as presented on the 
MASTER MENU SCREEN.   It may help to refer to the Sample  Screens 
in Appendix E as you read the following.


1.  DISPATCH RECORDS


PURPOSE
-------


The Dispatch Records function is used to store information  about 
your  dispatched  calls.   Once the information has been  entered 
through  your keyboard into PRS,  it is stored in a  computerized 
file  called DISPATCH.   Once stored,  it can be recalled to  the 
screen,  changed or deleted.   The information acts as the  basis 
for printed reports described under Subsection 6 Reports.



WHEN TO USE IT
--------------


You  will want to use the Dispatch Records function when you want 
to do the following:


   -  Store new details of a dispatched call
   -  Update details of a dispatched call
   -  View details of a dispatched call


HOW IT WORKS
------------


To  choose  the  Dispatch Records function from the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN, enter '1'.  PRS will display the DISPATCH SCREEN.  At the 
bottom of the screen you will be asked to choose what you want to 
do.   Your choices will be to ADD a call, SEARCH for a particular 
call,  seek HELP or to EXIT to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.   HELP and 
EXIT work as their names imply.  ADD and SEARCH work as follows:
                                
                               7








ŠA. ADD A CALL



   To ADD a call,  enter 'A'.   Your screen cursor will  position 
   itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the top, lefthand
   corner of your screen.   


  
   The note at the bottom of the screen prompts you to enter  the    
   individual's name.  As it states, you can press the RETURN key 
   if you decide NOT to add a call.   By pressing the RETURN key,    
   PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If you decide to add a call,  you will be required to enter an 
   individual's  last name.   The  reason is that when you  later 
   search for a particular call, you'll be searching by the name.  
   Whether  you choose to put details in any of the other  fields 
   is up to you.
 


   After you've  entered the last name, press the  RETURN key and
   your screen  cursor will  'skip' to the next  field.  To  skip 
   backward,  remember  to  use the BACKSPACE  key.  Continue  to    
   enter  the  details  of  the  call  until  you've  filled  the    
   entire  screen.  If  you are not sure what a particular  field       
   means,  all  the  fields are described in Appendix C.  If  the    
   details  of any  particular  field  happen to take up all  the    
   available  space,  you'll  note that your screen  cursor  will    
   automatically skip to the next.



   Once  you've entered details into the last  field,  press  the 
   RETURN  key.   A  question will appear at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen  in order to confirm that what you've just  entered  is    
   correct.   If  you've made a mistake,  enter 'N' and PRS  will    
   return the screen cursor to LAST NAME.



   If,  for  example,  you made a mistake in the location of  the 
   call,  press  the RETURN key until the screen cursor skips  to 
   the LOCATION field.  Now enter the correct address.   If there 
   are other mistakes,  press the RETURN key until you reach  the 
   bad field and enter the correct details.  When all corrections 
   have been made,  either continue to press the RETURN key until 
   the question about correctness again appears at the bottom  of 
   the screen or press Ctrl-W.  To use Ctrl-W, hold down the Ctrl
   key  on the left side of your keyboard and then press the  'W' 
   key once.

                               8








Š   Now  enter 'Y' to confirm that the details are  correct.   PRS       
   will  now  take  the details you've just entered and  make  an       
   entry  in the DISPATCH master file except under the  following             
   condition:
      
      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.


   If you do not  receive the  above message, rest assured that a
   new  call has been added to the DISPATCH master  file.   After 
   adding the new call,  PRS will return you to the  MASTER  MENU 
   SCREEN. 









































                               9









ŠB. SEARCHING FOR A CALL



   To  SEARCH  for a call,  enter 'S'.   Your screen cursor  will 
   position itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the top, 
   lefthand corner of your screen.   


  
   Again,  a  message  will appear at the bottom of  your  screen  
   prompting you to take an action.  Proceed by either entering a 
   last name or pressing the RETURN key to exit.



   If you choose to continue the search,  enter all or a  portion    
   of the  last name.  The  entry can be in  upper or lower case. 
   Once entered, press the RETURN key.  PRS  will now  attempt to 
   find the name in the DISPATCH master file.  If it cannot    be 
   found,  a  message will appear at the bottom of the screen  to   
   let you know.  It's up to you to research the correct spelling   
   or whether the call was ever entered.



   If the search is successful,  PRS will display all the details       
   it  contains  about the first call it finds that  matches  the    
   name  you  entered.   You  should confirm  that  the  call  is    
   actually the one you want.  



   For  example,  if you are searching for a call under the  name   
   of 'SMITH' and PRS has 2 listings under that name, the listing       
   of the first 'SMITH' will be  displayed.  It may turn out that 
   you actually want to see the second one.



   Or,  you might have  entered  only  'SM'  (as a  shortcut) and
   there are 2 listings under 'SMITH' and 1 under  'SMALLEY'.  In 
   this case PRS will  display the  details  of   'SMALLEY' while
   you  might   actually  want to see the  second   'SMITH'.  PRS  
   provides the ability to  skip  forward  and  backward   (to be
   covered shortly) to view other calls should this occur to you.



   At  the  bottom of the screen you'll note your options  as  to 
   what  you  can do next.  Enter the  letter that corresponds to 
   what you would like to do.



                               10









Š   If  you choose to CHANGE the call,  PRS will return the screen 
   cursor to LAST NAME.   Press the RETURN key until the   screen 
   cursor skips to the field(s) you want to change and enter  the 
   changes.  When all corrections have been made, either continue 
   to  press the RETURN key until the question about  correctness 
   appears at the bottom of the screen or press Ctrl-W.



   Now enter 'Y' to  confirm that  the details  are correct.  PRS
   will now take the details you've just entered and   change the
   entry  in the DISPATCH master file except under the  following       
   condition:

      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.

   If  you do not receive such a message,  rest assured that  PRS       
   has changed the  call in the DISPATCH master  file.  PRS  will          
   return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN. 



   To view the NEXT call, enter 'N'. PRS will display the details 
   of  the next call (alphabetically) within the DISPATCH  master 
   file.   Once  displayed,  you  will have the same  options  to 
   choose from at the bottom of the screen.  If you inadvertently  
   ask for the next call while at the end of the DISPATCH  master 
   file, a message will be displayed at the  bottom of the screen 
   telling you so.



   To view the PRIOR call,  enter 'P'.  PRS will  display the de-
   tails of the prior call  (alphabetically)  within the DISPATCH
   master file.   Once displayed,  you will have the same options 
   to  choose  from  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen.    If  you 
   inadvertently  ask for the prior call  while at the  beginning    
   of  the DISPATCH master file,  a message will be displayed  at 
   the bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To  DELETE the call  displayed on the  screen,  enter  'D'.  A    
   message  will be displayed at the bottom of the screen  asking    
   you  to confirm your intention.   If you decide not to  delete    
   the call, enter  'N', otherwise,  enter  'Y'.   Depending upon
   your  response,  PRS  will either  delete the  call  from  the
   DISPATCH master file or  leave the call unchanged. Either way,
   you will be returned to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.




                               11









Š   To choose the HARDCOPY option,  enter 'H'.  PRS will print the 
   contents  of the screen.   A message will be displayed at  the 
   bottom of the screen asking you to turn your printer on and to 
   align the paper.   In addition, you must confirm that you want 
   the contents of the screen printed by entering 'Y'. Otherwise, 
   enter 'N' and PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If  you  just  want to view the call and then  return  to  the 
   MASTER MENU SCREEN,  then you'll want to choose EXIT by enter-
   ing 'E'.

Š2.  CROSS REFERENCE



PURPOSE
-------


The  Cross Reference function makes it possible to store  details 
about local residents.   Generally, the details are gathered as a 
result of resident complaints and investigations.   Details about 
firearms  registration and medical problems can also  be  stored.  
Once stored,  the details can be recalled to the screen,  changed 
or  deleted.   The information acts as the basis for printed  re
ports described under Subsection 6 Reports.



WHEN TO USE IT
--------------


You  will want to use the Cross Reference function when you  want 
to do the following:


   -  Store new details about a local resident
   -  Update details about a local resident 
   -  View details about a local resident 




HOW IT WORKS
------------


To  choose  the  Cross Reference function from  the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN,  enter '2'.  PRS will display the CROSS REFERENCE SCREEN.  
At the bottom of the screen you will be asked to choose what  you 
want  to  do.   Your  choices will be to ADD a  resident  record, 
SEARCH  for a particular resident,  seek HELP or to EXIT  to  the 
MASTER  MENU  SCREEN.   HELP and EXIT work as their names  imply.  
ADD and SEARCH work as follows:











                               13









ŠA. ADD A RESIDENT RECORD



   To ADD a resident record,  enter 'A'.  Your screen cursor will 
   position  itself just beyond the LAST NAME field near the  top 
   lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   The note at the bottom of the screen prompts you to enter  the    
   individual's name.  As it states, you can press the RETURN key 
   if you decide NOT to add a record.  By pressing the RETURN key
   PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If  you decide to add a resident record,  you will be required 
   to  enter an individual's last name.  The reason is that  when 
   you later search for a particular resident,  you'll be search-
   ing by the name.  Whether you choose to put details in any  of 
   the other fields is up to you.
 


   After you've  entered the last name, press the  RETURN key and
   your screen  cursor will  'skip' to the next  field.  To  skip 
   backward,  remember  to  use the BACKSPACE  key.  Continue  to    
   enter  the  details  of the resident until you've  filled  the       
   entire  screen.  If  you are not sure what a particular  field          
   means,  all  the  fields are described in Appendix C.  If  the       
   details  of any  particular  field  happen to take up all  the       
   available  space,  you'll  note that your screen  cursor  will       
   automatically skip to the next.



   Once  you've entered details into the last  field,  press  the 
   RETURN  key.   A  question will appear at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen  in order to confirm that what you've just  entered  is    
   correct.   If  you've made a mistake,  enter 'N' and PRS  will    
   return the screen cursor to LAST NAME.



   If,  for  example,  you made a mistake in the spelling of  the 
   address, press the RETURN key until the screen cursor skips to 
   the address field.   Now enter the correct address.   If there 
   are other mistakes,  press the RETURN key until you reach  the 
   bad field and enter the correct details.  When all corrections 
   have been made,  either continue to press the RETURN key until 
   the question about correctness again appears at the bottom  of 
   the screen or press Ctrl-W.  


                               14









Š   Now  enter 'Y' to confirm that the details are  correct.   PRS       
   will  now  take  the details you've just entered and  make  an       
   entry  in the RESIDENT master file except under the  following             
   conditions:
      
      If you've blanked out the individual's last name,  PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.

      If  the  last  name already exists in the  RESIDENT  master       
      file,  PRS will display a message telling you so.  You must       
      then  choose  whether  to allow PRS to make  an  additional       
      entry  under  the  same  name.    A  cautionary  note,  PRS             
      tells  you of the duplicate so that you can avoid  entering             
      the same record twice.


   If  you  do not receive either of  the  above  messages,  rest 
   assured  that  a  new resident record has  been added  to  the  
   RESIDENT  master file.   After adding the new call,  PRS  will 
   return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN. 


































                               15









ŠB. SEARCHING FOR A RESIDENT RECORD



   To SEARCH for a resident, enter  'S'.  Your screen cursor will
   position itself just beyond the  LAST NAME  field near the top
   lefthand corner of your screen.   



   Again,  a  message  will appear at the bottom of  your  screen  
   prompting you to take an action.  Proceed by either entering a 
   last name or pressing the RETURN key to exit.



   If you choose to continue the search,  enter all or a  portion    
   of the  last name.  The  entry can be in  upper or lower case. 
   Once entered, press the RETURN key.  PRS  will now  attempt to 
   find the name in the RESIDENT  master file.   If it cannot  be 
   found,  a  message will appear at the bottom of the screen  to   
   let you know.  It's up to you to research the correct spelling   
   or whether the resident record was ever entered.



   If the search is successful,  PRS will display all the details          
   it contains about the first resident it finds that matches the       
   name  you  entered.   You  should confirm that the  record  is       
   actually the one you want.  



   For example,  if you are searching for a resident by the  name      
   of  'SMITH' and PRS has 2 records under that name,  the  first 
   'SMITH' will be displayed.  It may turn out that  you actually
   want to see the second one.



   Or,  you might have  entered  only  'SM'  (as a  shortcut) and
   there are 2 records under  'SMITH' and 1 under  'SMALLEY'.  In 
   this case PRS will  display the  details  of   'SMALLEY' while
   you  might   actually  want to see the  second   'SMITH'.  PRS  
   provides the ability to  skip  forward  and  backward   (to be
   covered shortly) to view records should this occur to you.



   At  the  bottom of the screen you'll note your options  as  to 
   what  you  can do next.  Enter the  letter that corresponds to 
   what you would like to do.



                               16









Š   To CHANGE the resident record, enter 'C'.  PRS will return the
   screen cursor to LAST  NAME.   Press the RETURN key  until the
   screen  cursor skips to the  field(s)  you want to  change and       
   enter  the  changes.    When all corrections have  been  made,       
   either  continue  to press the RETURN key until  the  question       
   about correctness appears at the bottom of the screen or press       
   Ctrl-W.



   Now enter 'Y' to  confirm that  the details  are correct.  PRS
   will now take the details you've just entered and   change the
   entry  in the RESIDENT master file except under the  following       
   condition:


      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.


      
   If you do not receive such  a message,  rest assured that  PRS    
   has  changed the resident record in the  RESIDENT master file.  
   PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN. 



   To view the NEXT resident  record,  enter  'N'.  PRS will dis-
   play the details of the next resident (alphabetically)  within 
   the  RESIDENT master file.  Once displayed,  you will have the 
   same options to choose from at the bottom of the  screen.   If 
   you  inadvertently  ask for the next resident record while  at 
   the  end of the RESIDENT master file,  a message will be  dis-
   played at the bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To view the PRIOR  resident record, enter  'P'.  PRS will dis-
   play the details of the prior resident (alphabetically) within
   the RESIDENT master file.  Once displayed,  you will have  the 
   same  options to choose from at the bottom of the screen.   If 
   you  inadvertently ask for the prior resident record while  at 
   the beginning of the RESIDENT master file,  a message will  be 
   displayed at the bottom of the screen telling you so.   



   To  DELETE the resident record displayed on the screen,  enter 
   'D'.  A message will be displayed at the bottom of the  screen 
   asking  you to confirm your intention.  If you decide  not  to 
   delete the record, enter 'N', otherwise, enter 'Y'.  Depending 
   upon your response, PRS will either delete the resident record 
   from  the RESIDENT master file or leave the record  unchanged. 
   Either way, you will be returned to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.

                               17








Š   To choose the HARDCOPY option,  enter 'H'.  PRS will print the 
   contents  of the  screen.  A message will be displayed at  the 
   bottom of the screen asking you to turn your printer on and to 
   align the paper.  In addition,  you must confirm that you want 
   the contents of the screen printed by entering 'Y'. Otherwise, 
   enter 'N' and PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If  you just want to view the resident call and then return to 
   the  MASTER  MENU SCREEN,  then you'll want to choose EXIT  by 
   entering 'E'.

Š3.  WARRANT RECORDS




PURPOSE
-------


The  Warrant Records function makes it possible to store  details 
about  outstanding  warrants.   Generally,  the  details  of  the 
warrant  are  entered  into PRS when issued from a  local  court.  
Once stored,  the details can be recalled to the screen,  changed 
or  deleted.   The  information  acts as the  basis  for  printed 
reports described under Subsection 6 Reports.



WHEN TO USE IT
--------------


You will want to use the Warrant Records  function when you  want 
to do the following:


   -  Store new details of an outstanding warrant
   -  Update details about a warrant 
   -  View details about a warrant 




HOW IT WORKS
------------


To  choose  the  Warrant Records function from  the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN,  enter '3'.  PRS will display the WARRANT SCREEN.  At the 
bottom of the screen you will be asked to choose what you want to 
do.   Your choices will be to ADD a warrant record,  SEARCH for a 
particular  warrant,  seek  HELP  or to EXIT to the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN.  HELP and EXIT work as their names imply.  ADD and SEARCH 
work as follows:











                               19









ŠA. ADD A WARRANT RECORD



   To ADD a warrant record,  enter  'A'.  Your screen cursor will
   position itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the  top 
   lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   The note at the bottom of the screen prompts you to enter  the    
   individual's name.  As it states, you can press the RETURN key 
   if  you  decide NOT to add a record.   By pressing  the RETURN  
   key, PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If you decide to add a warrant record, you will be required to 
   enter an individual's last name.  The reason is  that when you 
   later search for a particular warrant,  you'll be searching by 
   the  name.  Whether  you choose to put details in any  of  the      
   other fields is up to you.
 


   After you've  entered the last name, press the  RETURN key and
   your screen  cursor will  'skip' to the next  field.  To  skip 
   backward,  remember  to  use the BACKSPACE  key.  Continue  to    
   enter  the  details  of the warrant until  you've  filled  the          
   entire  screen.  If you are not sure what a  particular  field             
   means,  all  the fields are described in Appendix  C.  If  the          
   details  of any  particular  field  happen to take up all  the          
   available  space,  you'll  note that your screen  cursor  will          
   automatically skip to the next.



   Once  you've entered details into the last  field,  press  the 
   RETURN  key.   A  question will appear at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen  in order to confirm that what you've just  entered  is    
   correct.   If  you've made a mistake,  enter 'N' and PRS  will    
   return the screen cursor to LAST NAME.



   If,  for  example,  you made a mistake in the spelling of  the 
   city,  press the  RETURN key until the screen  cursor skips to 
   the CITY field.  Now correct the mistake.  If there are  other
   mistakes,  press  the RETURN key until you reach the bad field 
   and enter the correct details.  When all corrections have been
   made, either continue to press the RETURN key until the quest-
   ion  about  correctness  again appears at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen or press Ctrl-W.  


                               20









Š   Now  enter 'Y' to confirm that the details are  correct.   PRS       
   will  now  take  the details you've just entered and  make  an       
   entry  in the  WARRANT master file except under the  following             
   condition:
      

      If you've blanked out the individual's last name,  PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.


   If you do not receive the  above message, rest  assured that a
   new warrant record has been added to the WARRANT master  file. 
   After adding the new record, PRS will return you to the MASTER 
   MENU SCREEN.

ŠB. SEARCHING FOR A WARRANT



   To SEARCH for a warrant, enter  'S'.  Your screen  cursor will  
   position  itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the top      
   lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   Again,  a  message  will appear at the bottom of  your  screen  
   prompting you to take an action.  Proceed by either entering a 
   last name or pressing the RETURN key to exit.



   If you choose to continue the search,  enter all or a  portion    
   of the  last name.  The  entry can be in  upper or lower case. 
   Once entered, press the RETURN key.  PRS  will now  attempt to

   either  continue  to press the RETURN key until  the  question       
   about correctness appears at the bottom of the screen or press       
   Ctrl-W.



   Now enter 'Y' to  confirm that  the details  are correct.  PRS
   will now take the details you've just entered and   change the
   entry  in the WARRANT  master file except under the  following       
   condition:


      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.

      
   If you do not receive such a  message,  rest assured that  PRS    
   has  changed the warrant  record in the WARRANT  master  file.  
   PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.

   If  you  just want to view the record and then return  to  the    
   MASTER  MENU  SCREEN,  then  you'll want  to  choose  EXIT  by 
   entering 'E'.

Š4.  ARREST RECORDS




PURPOSE
-------


The  Arrest Records function makes it possible to  store  details 
about local arrests.  Once stored, the details can be recalled to 
the  screen,  changed  or deleted.   The information acts as  the 
basis for printed reports described under Subsection 6 Reports.



WHEN TO USE IT
--------------


You will want to use the Arrest Records function when you want to 
do the following:


   -  Store new details of an arrest
   -  Update details about an arrest 
   -  View details of an arrest 




HOW IT WORKS
------------


To  choose  the  Arrest  Records function from  the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN,  enter '4'.   PRS will display the ARREST SCREEN.  At the 
bottom of the screen you will be asked to choose what you want to 
do.   Your choices will be to ADD an arrest record,  SEARCH for a 
particular  arrest,   seek  HELP  or to EXIT to the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN.  HELP and EXIT work as their names imply.  ADD and SEARCH 
work as follows:













                               25









ŠA. ADD AN ARREST RECORD



   To ADD an arrest record,  enter 'A'.  Your screen cursor  will 
   position  itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the top  
   lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   The note at the bottom of the screen prompts you to enter  the    
   individual's name.  As it states, you can press the RETURN key 
   if  you  decide NOT to add a record.   By pressing  the RETURN  
   key, PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If you decide to add an arrest record, you will be required to 
   enter an individual's last name.  The reason is that  when you 
   later search  for a particular  arrest, you'll be searching by 
   the  name.  Whether  you choose to put details in any  of  the 
   other fields is up to you.
 


   After you've  entered the last name, press the  RETURN key and
   your screen  cursor will  'skip' to the next  field.  To  skip 
   backward,  remember  to  use the BACKSPACE  key.  Continue  to    
   enter  the  details  of the arrest  until  you've  filled  the          
   entire  screen.  If you are not sure what a  particular  field             
   means,  all  the fields are described in Appendix  C.  If  the          
   details  of any  particular  field  happen to take up all  the          
   available  space,  you'll  note that your screen  cursor  will          
   automatically skip to the next.



   Once  you've entered details into the last  field,  press  the 
   RETURN  key.   A  question will appear at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen  in order to confirm that what you've just  entered  is    
   correct.   If  you've made a mistake,  enter 'N' and PRS  will    
   return the screen cursor to LAST NAME.



   If,  for example,  you made a mistake in the continuance date, 
   press the RETURN key until the screen cursor skips to the CONT 
   DATE field.  Now correct the mistake.  If there are other mis-
   takes,  press the RETURN key until you reach the bad field and 
   enter  the  correct details.   When all corrections have  been 
   made,  either  continue  to  press the RETURN  key  until  the 
   question about correctness again appears at the bottom of  the 
   screen or press Ctrl-W.  


                               26









Š   Now  enter 'Y' to confirm that the details are  correct.   PRS       
   will  now  take  the details you've just entered and  make  an       
   entry  in the  ARREST  master file except under the  following             
   condition:
      

      If you've blanked out the individual's last name,  PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you       
      that a name is required.


   If you do not receive the  above message, rest assured that  a
   new arrest record has been added to the ARREST   master  file.
   After  adding the new record,  PRS  will  return  you  to  the
   MASTER MENU SCREEN. 








































                               27









ŠB. SEARCHING FOR AN ARREST RECORD



   To SEARCH for an arrest record, enter 'S'.  Your screen cursor 
   will position itself just beyond the LAST NAME field  near the 
   top lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   Again,  a  message  will appear at the bottom of  your  screen  
   prompting you to take an action.  Proceed by either entering a 
   last name or pressing the RETURN key to exit.



   If you choose to continue the search,  enter all or a  portion    
   Once entered, press the RETURN key.  PRS  will now  attempt to 
   find the name in the  ARREST   master  file.  If it cannot  be 
   found,  a  message will appear at the bottom of the screen  to   
   let you know.  It's up to you to research the correct spelling   
   or whether the arrest record was ever entered.



   If the search is successful,  PRS will display all the details          
   it contains about the first arrest  it finds that matches  the          
   name you entered.  You should confirm that the record is  act-     
   ually the one you want.  



   For  example,  if  you are searching for an arrest record  for 
   'SMITH'  and  PRS has 2 records under  that  name,  the  first  
   'SMITH' will  be displayed. It may turn out that  you actually 
   want to see the second one.



   Or,  you might have  entered  only  'SM'  (as a  shortcut) and
   there are 2 records under  'SMITH' and 1 under  'SMALLEY'.  In 
   this case PRS will  display the  details  of   'SMALLEY' while
   you  might   actually  want to see the  second   'SMITH'.  PRS  
   provides the ability to  skip  forward  and  backward   (to be
   covered shortly) to view records should this occur to you.



   At  the  bottom of the screen you'll note your options  as  to 
   what  you  can do next.  Enter the  letter that corresponds to 
   what you would like to do.




                               28









Š   To CHANGE the arrest record,  enter 'C'.  PRS will  return the
   screen cursor to LAST NAME.   Press the RETURN key  until  the
   screen  cursor  skips to the  field(s)  you want to change and       
   enter  the  changes.    When all corrections have  been  made,       
   either  continue  to press the RETURN key until  the  question       
   about correctness appears at the bottom of the screen or press       
   Ctrl-W.



   Now enter 'Y' to  confirm that  the details  are correct.  PRS
   will now take the details you've just entered and   change the
   entry  in the ARREST  master file  except under the  following       
   condition:


      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.

      
   If you do not receive such a message, rest assured that    PRS    
   has changed the arrest record in the  ARREST master file.  PRS
   will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN. 



   To view the NEXT arrest record,  enter  'N'.  PRS will display
   the  details  of the next arrest (alphabetically)  within  the 
   ARREST master file. Once displayed, you will have the same op-
   tions to choose from at the bottom of the screen.  If you  in-   
   advertently ask for the next arrest record while at the end of 
   the  ARREST  master file,  a message will be displayed at  the 
   bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To view the PRIOR  arrest record,  enter  'P'.  PRS will  dis- 
   play  the details of the prior arrest (alphabetically)  within 
   the ARREST master file. Once displayed, you will have the same
   options  to choose from at the bottom of the screen.   If  you 
   inadvertently ask for the prior arrest record while at the be-
   gining of the ARREST  master file, a message will be displayed
   at the bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To  DELETE the arrest record displayed on  the  screen,  enter 
   'D'.  A message will be displayed at the bottom of the  screen 
   asking  you to confirm your intention.   If you decide not  to 
   delete the record, enter 'N', otherwise, enter 'Y'.  Depending 
   upon your response,  PRS will either delete the arrest  record  
   from  the  ARREST master file or leave the  record  unchanged. 
   Either way, you will be returned to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.

                               29









Š   To choose the HARDCOPY option, enter  'H'.  PRS will print the 
   contents of the  screen.   A message will be  displayed at the 
   bottom of the screen asking you to turn your printer on and to 
   align the paper.  In addition,  you must confirm that you want 
   the contents of the screen printed by entering 'Y'. Otherwise, 
   enter 'N' and PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If  you  just want to view the record and then return  to  the    
   MASTER MENU SCREEN,  then you'll want to choose EXIT by enter-
   ing 'E'.

Š5.  CRIMINAL RECORDS




PURPOSE
-------


The Criminal Records function makes it possible to store  details 
about the criminal history of local residents.   Once stored, the 
details can be recalled to the screen,  changed or deleted.   The 
information acts as the basis for printed reports described under 
Subsection 6 Reports.



WHEN TO USE IT
--------------


You  will want to use the Criminal Records function when you want 
to do the following:


   -  Store new details of a criminal record
   -  Update details about a criminal record
   -  View details of a criminal record




HOW IT WORKS
------------


To  choose  the  Criminal Records function from the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN,  enter '5'.  PRS will display the CRIMINAL SCREEN. At the 
bottom of the screen you will be asked to choose what you want to 
do.   Your choices will be to ADD a criminal record, SEARCH for a 
particular  record,   seek  HELP or to EXIT to  the  MASTER  MENU 
SCREEN.  HELP and EXIT work as their names imply.  ADD and SEARCH 
work as follows:












                               31









ŠA. ADD A CRIMINAL RECORD



   To ADD a criminal record, enter 'A'.  Your  screen cursor will
   position itself just beyond the  LAST NAME field near the  top
   lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   The note at the bottom of the screen prompts you to enter  the    
   individual's name.  As it states, you can press the RETURN key 
   if  you  decide NOT to add a record.   By pressing  the RETURN  
   key, PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If you decide to add a criminal record,  you will be  required 
   to  enter an individual's last name.  The reason is that  when 
   you later search for a particular record,  you'll be searching 
   by the name.  Whether you choose to put details in any of  the 
   other fields is up to you.
 


   After you've  entered the last name, press the  RETURN key and
   your screen  cursor will  'skip' to the next  field.  To  skip 
   backward,  remember  to  use the BACKSPACE  key.  Continue  to    
   enter  the details of the criminal record until you've  filled 
   the entire screen. If you are not sure what a particular field
   means,  all  the fields are described in Appendix  C.  If  the             
   details  of any  particular  field  happen to take up all  the             
   available  space,  you'll  note that your screen  cursor  will             
   automatically skip to the next.



   Once  you've entered details into the last  field,  press  the 
   RETURN  key.   A  question will appear at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen  in order to confirm that what you've just  entered  is    
   correct.   If  you've made a mistake,  enter 'N' and PRS  will    
   return the screen cursor to LAST NAME.



   If,  for example,  you made a mistake in the date of the crim-
   inal act,  press the RETURN key until the screen cursor  skips 
   to the DATE field. Now correct the mistake. If there are other
   mistakes,  press  the RETURN key until you reach the bad field 
   and enter the correct details.  When all corrections have been
   made, either continue to press the RETURN key until the quest-
   ion  about  correctness  again appears at the  bottom  of  the 
   screen or press Ctrl-W.  


                               32









Š   Now  enter 'Y' to confirm that the details are  correct.   PRS       
   will  now  take  the details you've just entered and  make  an       
   entry  in the CRIMINAL master file except under the  following             
   condition:
      

      If you've blanked out the individual's last name,  PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.


   If you do not receive the  above message, rest assured that  a
   new criminal record has been added to the CRIMINAL master file.
   After  adding the new record,  PRS  will  return  you  to  the
   MASTER MENU SCREEN. 








































                               33









ŠB. SEARCHING FOR A CRIMINAL RECORD



   To SEARCH for a criminal record,  enter 'S'.  Your screen cur-   
   sor  will  position  itself just beyond the  LAST  NAME  field    
   near the top lefthand corner of your screen.  


  
   Again,  a  message  will appear at the bottom of  your  screen  
   prompting you to take an action.  Proceed by either entering a 
   last name or pressing the RETURN key to exit.



   If you choose to continue the search,  enter all or a  portion    
   of the  last name.  The  entry can be in  upper or lower case. 
   Once entered, press the RETURN key.  PRS  will now  attempt to 
   find the name in the CRIMINAL  master  file.  If it cannot  be 
   found,  a  message will appear at the bottom of the screen  to   
   let you know.  It's up to you to research the correct spelling   
   or whether the criminal record was ever entered.



   If the search is successful,  PRS will display all the details             
   it  contains  about  the first criminal record it  finds  that 
   matches  the  name you entered.   You should confirm that  the 
   record is actually the one you want.  



   For  example,  if you are searching for a criminal record  for 
   'SMITH'  and  PRS has 2 records under  that  name,  the  first  
   'SMITH' will be displayed.  It may turn out that  you actually 
   want to see the second one.



   Or,  you might have  entered  only  'SM'  (as a  shortcut) and
   there are 2 records under  'SMITH' and 1 under  'SMALLEY'.  In 
   this case PRS will  display the  details  of   'SMALLEY' while
   you  might   actually  want to see the  second   'SMITH'.  PRS  
   provides the ability to  skip  forward  and  backward   (to be
   covered shortly) to view records should this occur to you.



   At  the  bottom of the screen you'll note your options  as  to 
   what  you  can do next.  Enter the  letter that corresponds to 
   what you would like to do.



                               34









Š   To CHANGE the  criminal record,  enter  'C'.  PRS will  return 
   the  screen cursor to LAST NAME.   Press the RETURN key  until 
   the screen cursor skips to the field(s) you want to change and       
   enter  the  changes.    When all corrections have  been  made,       
   either  continue  to press the RETURN key until  the  question       
   about correctness appears at the bottom of the screen or press       
   Ctrl-W.



   Now enter 'Y' to  confirm that  the details  are correct.  PRS
   will now take the details you've just entered and   change the
   entry in the CRIMINAL master file  except under the  following       
   condition:


      If you've blanked out the individual's last  name, PRS will 
      display a message at the bottom of the screen to remind you 
      that a name is required.

      
   If you do not receive  such a message,  rest assured that  PRS    
   has  changed the criminal record in the CRIMINAL master  file.  
   PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN. 



   To view the NEXT  criminal record,  enter  'N'.  PRS will dis-
   play  the  details of the next record (alphabetically)  within 
   the CRIMINAL master file.  Once displayed,  you will have  the 
   same  options to choose from at the bottom of the  screen.  If 
   you  inadvertently  ask for the next criminal record while  at 
   the  end of the CRIMINAL master file,  a message will be  dis
   played at the bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To view the PRIOR  criminal record, enter  'P'.  PRS will dis-
   play  the details of the prior record (alphabetically)  within 
   the CRIMINAL master file.  Once displayed,  you will have  the 
   same  options to choose from  at the bottom of the screen.  If
   you  inadvertently ask for the prior criminal record while  at 
   the  beginning of  the CRIMINAL master file, a message will be
   displayed at the bottom of the screen telling you so.



   To DELETE the criminal record displayed on the  screen,  enter 
   'D'.   A   message will  be  displayed at  the  bottom  of the 
   screen  asking you to confirm your intention.   If you  decide 
   not to delete  the record,  enter 'N',  otherwise,  enter 'Y'.
   Depending  upon   your response,  PRS will either  delete  the 
   criminal record from  the CRIMINAL master  file  or  leave the 
   record  unchanged.  Either way,  you  will be returned to  the 
   MASTER MENU SCREEN.

                               35








Š   To choose the HARDCOPY option, enter  'H'.  PRS will print the 
   contents of the  screen.   A  message will be displayed at the 
   bottom of the screen asking you to turn your printer on and to 
   align the paper.   In addition, you must confirm that you want 
   the contents of the screen printed by entering 'Y'. Otherwise, 
   enter 'N' and PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.



   If  you  just want to view the record and then return  to  the    
   MASTER MENU SCREEN,  then you'll want to choose EXIT by enter-
   ing 'E'.

Š6.  REPORTS




PURPOSE
-------


The  Report function is used to create a variety of reports about 
crimes committed, dispatch calls, firearms and warrants. 



HOW IT WORKS
------------


To choose the Report function from the MASTER MENU SCREEN,  enter 
'6'.   PRS will display the REPORT MENU SCREEN. You will be asked 
to  choose  which  report you want to create.  Your  choices  are 
presented below in detail.   When requesting any of the following 
reports,  PRS  will display another screen reminding you to  turn 
your  printer  on and to align your paper.   Depending  upon  the 
report, you may also be asked to provide additional details.  You 
will  also  be given the opportunity to exit and  not  print  the 
report.


Examples of the following reports are included in Appendix D.  It 
may  be  helpful to look at them as you're reading the  following 
descriptions.



   UNIFORM CRIME REPORT



   The  Uniform  Crime  Report  will show  a  summary  of  crimes 
   committed  in  any  one particular  month.   The  details  are 
   printed in order by complaint class, sex of the individual and 
   age  group.   The  UCR presents a convenient way in  which  to 
   analyze the type of crimes committed, by whom and at what age.

   
   When you request the UCR, you will be asked to enter the month 
   and  year  that the report should cover.   The  details  about 
   criminal activities will then be sorted in order by  complaint 
   class, sex and age.   


   When the sorting process is complete,  you'll be asked to turn    
   your  printer  on and align the paper.   If you decide NOT  to 
   print the report,  PRS will allow you to exit.  Otherwise, the 
   UCR will begin printing.

                               37







Š   DISPATCH CALL ANALYSIS  



   The  Dispatch  Call Analysis Report shows the details  of  all 
   dispatch  call  for a particular month.   The details  can  be 
   displayed  in order by complaint code or by sector/area.   The 
   report  presents a convenient way in which to analyze the type 
   of  dispatch  calls  received  and from where  the  calls  are 
   received.   In  this  manner,  patterns of  activities  within 
   particular areas, if present, may be noticed.


   When you request the Dispatch Call Analysis Report,  you  will    
   be  asked to enter the month and year that the  report  should 
   cover. Next, you will be asked whether the report should be in 
   order  by  complaint  code or  sector/area.   The  details  of 
   dispatch calls will then be sorted.


   When the sorting process is complete,  you'll be asked to turn    
   your  printer  on and align the paper.   If you decide NOT  to 
   print the report,  PRS will allow you to exit.  Otherwise, the 
   Dispatch Call Analysis Report will begin printing.  The report 
   shows the complaint code,  sector/area, log number, date, day, 
   time,  individual  name and disposition for each dispatch call 
   within the specified month.



   FIREARMS LICENSE REPORT 



   The  Firearms  License  Report shows details of  all  firearms 
   records in order by a License To Carry number or by a Firearms 
   Identification  number.   The  report is a convenient  way  in 
   which  to order all firearms records by other than the  owners 
   name.


   When  you  request  the  Firearms  License  Report,  you  will       
   be asked to enter whether the report should be in    order  by 
   LTC or FID.  The firearms details will then be sorted.


   When the sorting process is complete,  you'll be asked to turn    
   your  printer  on and align the paper.   If you decide NOT  to 
   print the report,  PRS will allow you to exit.  Otherwise, the 
   Firearms  License  Report  will begin  printing.   The  report    
   shows  the owner name,  date of birth,  date issued,  date  of 
   expiration, height, weight, hair and eye color.



                               38









Š   FIREARMS ALPHA REPORT 



   The  Firearms  Alpha Report shows details of all firearms  re-
   cords  in order by the owner's name.  The report is a  conven-
   ient way in which to order all firearms records for quick ref-
   erence by owner's name.


   When you request the Firearms Alpha Report, you'll be asked to 
   turn your printer on and align the paper.   If you decide  NOT 
   to print the report,  PRS will allow you to exit.   Otherwise, 
   the  Firearms Alpha Report will begin  printing.   The  report 
   shows  the owner name,  date of birth,  license  number,  date 
   issued,  date  of expiration,  height,  weight,  hair and  eye 
   color.




   OUTSTANDING WARRANTS 


   The Outstanding Warrants Report shows details of all  warrants 
   that have a current status of outstanding...in other words,  a 
   warrant that has not been served.  The report is a  convenient 
   way  in which to quickly see all warrants that are waiting  to 
   be served.


   When  you request the Outstanding Warrants Report,  you'll  be 
   asked  to  turn your printer on and align the paper.   If  you 
   decide  NOT to print the report,  PRS will allow you to  exit.  
   Otherwise,   the   Outstanding  Warrants  Report  will   begin 
   printing.  The  report  shows the individual's name,  date  of 
   warrant,  warrant number, any action taken, date of the action 
   and status.




   REPORT DESCRIPTIONS


 
   If you choose Report Descriptions, PRS will display a screen
   that contains a brief description of the report options.

ŠAPPENDIX A.   HANDS-ON DEMONSTRATION 



The  purpose  of this section is to give you  a  brief,  hands-on 
demonstration  of how to use PRS.   We'll experience each of  its 
functions and how they work.  You'll also get a chance to see all 
PRS menus and most screens in action.



HOW TO BEGIN
------------


Go  to the PRS subdirectory,  enter the command 'PRS' followed by 
pressing the RETURN key.


You should now be looking at the PRS logo screen.   Press any key 
to display the MASTER MENU SCREEN.




THE DEMONSTRATION


Let's pretend that you've used PRS for months now.   On this par-
ticular day you need to do the following:

   
   1.  Add details about a dispatch call
   2.  Change the details about a dispatch call
   3.  Add details about a new resident to the Cross Reference
   4.  Add a new warrant
   5.  Add details about an arrest 
   6.  Add details about a criminal record
   7.  Print a report about outstanding warrants



The  following steps will show you how to accomplish  the  above.  
We  encourage  you  to follow these steps as presented  to  avoid 
confusion.   After  you are comfortable with how PRS works, don't 
hesitate to experiment.









                               40









ŠADD DETAILS ABOUT A DISPATCH CALL



While observing the MASTER MENU SCREEN, you'll note  the  choices 
available to you.  Since you need to add details about a dispatch 
call  your choice is Dispatch Records.   Please enter your choice 
by typing '1'.  



You are now looking at the DISPATCH SCREEN.   Notice the  choices 
available  to  you  at the bottom of the screen.   You  can  ADD, 
SEARCH,  seek HELP or EXIT back to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.  Since 
you  want to add a dispatch record,  enter your choice by  typing 
'A'.  



PRS  will  respond  by changing the screen name to  DISPATCH  ADD 
SCREEN,  displaying  a  message at the bottom of the  screen  and 
placing  the screen cursor at LAST NAME.   You may now enter  the 
details  of a new dispatch call.  Remember that PRS  stores  your 
dispatch  call by the individual's last name.   For this  reason, 
you'll  be required to enter a name in order to properly create a 
dispatch call.  



Go  ahead and enter a dispatch call using  make-believe  informa-
tion.  Please use 'TEST' as the individual's last name.  Skip the
fields (by pressing the RETURN  key) that you're unfamiliar with.  
To  return  to a previous field,  use the BACKSPACE  key.  For  a 
complete discussion of all screen fields,  please refer to Appen
dix C. 



Once  you've entered information in the last field, PRS will  ask 
"IS THE ABOVE CORRECT ? (Y/N)". If you enter 'Y' PRS will now add 
your new dispatch call to the DISPATCH master file.  If you enter 
'N'  PRS will reposition the screen cursor at LAST NAME  so  that 
you may correct your entry.  Please enter 'Y'.



That's all there is to adding new dispatch calls.  For a complete 
discussion about the  other options available when using Dispatch 
Records, please refer to Section E Dispatch Records.  






                               41









ŠCHANGE THE DETAILS ABOUT A DISPATCH CALL



After  adding  a new dispatch call,  PRS will return you  to  the 
MASTER  MENU SCREEN.   You're now ready to change the details  of 
the dispatch call you've just entered.  In this case, you'll want 
to again choose the first option on the screen, Dispatch Records.  
Please enter your choice by typing '1'.



You  are  now  looking  at the DISPATCH  SCREEN.  You  should  be 
familiar  with this screen.   Before you can change  the  details 
about  a  dispatch record,  you must first find the  record.   In 
order to do so you must SEARCH for the record.  Please enter your 
choice by typing 'S'.  



PRS  will respond by changing the screen name to DISPATCH  SEARCH 
SCREEN,  displaying  a  message at the bottom of the  screen  and 
placing  the screen cursor at LAST NAME.   You may now enter  the 
name  of  the individual you are searching for.   In  this  case, 
enter the name 'TEST' and press the RETURN key.



PRS  will  now  search  for the dispatch  call  and  display  the 
details.  If the call cannot be found, PRS will present a message 
at the bottom of the screen telling you so.   In that case, check 
your spelling and retry.



Note the options available at the bottom of the screen.   You can 
CHANGE, view the NEXT or PRIOR record, DELETE the record, print a 
HARDCOPY of the screen or EXIT to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.   Since 
you want to change details about the dispatch call, enter 'C'. 



PRS  highlights all the fields that pertain to the dispatch call, 
beginning  with the last name of the individual.   Go  ahead  and 
change  any  of the dispatch call details.   Skip the fields  (by 
pressing  the RETURN key) that you don't want to change.   For  a 
complete discussion of all screen fields,  please refer to Appen
dix C.  



Since you're entering information about a dispatch call,  some of 
the fields may remain empty.   Why ?  Because some of the details 
may not be known until the call is closed.   PRS was designed  so 
that you can add details, as they're known, at your convenience.

                               42








ŠOnce  you've entered information in the last field PRS, will  ask 
"IS  THE ABOVE CORRECT ?  (Y/N)".  If you enter 'Y' PRS will  now 
change  the  details of the dispatch call in the DISPATCH  master 
file.   If you enter 'N' PRS will reposition the screen cursor at 
LAST NAME so that you may correct your entry.  Please enter 'Y'.



That's all there is to changing details of a dispatch call.  Once 
the call is closed,  you would repeat the above steps to add  any 
final details.












































                               43









ŠADD DETAILS ABOUT A NEW RESIDENT TO THE CROSS REFERENCE


After  changing the details of a dispatch call,  PRS will  return 
you  to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.   You're now ready to add details 
about  a new resident to the  Cross  Reference,  therefore,  your 
choice  is Cross Reference.   Please enter your choice by  typing 
'2'.  


You  are now looking at the CROSS REFERENCE SCREEN.   Notice  the 
choices  available to you at the bottom of the screen.   You  can 
ADD,  SEARCH,  seek HELP or EXIT back to the MASTER MENU  SCREEN.  
Since you want to add a cross reference record, enter your choice 
by  typing  'A'.   Notice the consistency with which records  are 
added and changed throughout PRS.


PRS  will respond by changing the screen name to CROSS  REFERENCE 
ADD SCREEN,  displaying a message at the bottom of the screen and 
placing  the screen cursor at LAST NAME.   You may now enter  the 
details  of a new cross reference  record.   Remember  that,  PRS 
stores  the cross reference record by the individual's last name.  
For this reason,  you'll be required to enter a name in order  to 
properly create a record.  


Go ahead and enter a make-believe cross reference record.  Please 
use  'TEST' as the individual's last name.   Skip the fields  (by 
pressing the RETURN key) that you're unfamiliar with.   To return 
to  a  previous  field,  use the BACKSPACE key.  For  a  complete 
discussion of all screen fields, please refer to Appendix C. 


Once  you've entered information in the last field, PRS will  ask 
"IS THE ABOVE CORRECT ? (Y/N)". If you enter 'Y' PRS will now add 
the  cross reference record to the CROSS REFERENCE  master  file.  
If  you  enter 'N' PRS will reposition the screen cursor at  LAST 
NAME so that you may correct your entry.  Please enter 'Y'.


PRS  will now check for a duplicate name.   If found,  a  message 
will be displayed telling you so.   This is done to avoid  adding 
duplicate records in the master file.   IF the name is not really 
a duplicate, you will be able to tell PRS to go ahead and add the 
record to the master file.


That's all there is to adding new cross reference records.  For a 
complete discussion about the  other options available when using 
Cross Reference, please refer to Section E Cross Reference.  




                               44









ŠADD A NEW WARRANT



After  adding a resident to the Cross Reference,  PRS will return 
you  to  the MASTER MENU SCREEN.   You're now ready  to  add  the 
details  of a new warrant.   In this case,  you'll want to choose 
the third option on the screen,  Warrant Records.   Please  enter 
your choice by typing '3'.



You  are now looking at the WARRANT SCREEN.   Notice the  choices 
available  to  you  at the bottom of the screen.   You  can  ADD, 
SEARCH,  seek HELP or EXIT back to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.  Since 
you  want to add a warrant record,  enter your choice  by  typing 
'A'.  Again,  notice the consistency with which records are added 
and changed throughout PRS.



PRS  will  respond  by changing the screen name  to  WARRANT  ADD 
SCREEN,  displaying  a  message at the bottom of the  screen  and 
placing  the screen cursor at LAST NAME.   You may now enter  the 
details  of a new warrant record.   



Go  ahead  and enter a make-believe warrant record.   Please  use 
'TEST' as the individual's last name.   In addition, please enter 
'O' in the STATUS field.   We want to have at least 1 outstanding 
warrant in the file when we print a report later. 



Skip  the  fields (by pressing the RETURN key) that you're  unfa-
miliar with.   To return to a previous field,  use the  BACKSPACE 
key. For a complete discussion of all screen fields, please refer 
to Appendix C. 



Once you've entered information in the last field, PRS  will  ask 
"IS THE ABOVE CORRECT ?  (Y/N)".   If you enter 'Y' PRS will  now 
add the warrant record to the WARRANT master file.   If you enter 
'N'  PRS  will reposition the screen cursor at LAST NAME so  that 
you may correct your entry.  Please enter 'Y'.



That's  all  there  is to adding a new  warrant  record.   For  a 
complete discussion about the  other options available when using 
Warrant Records, please refer to Section E Warrant Records.  


                               45









ŠADD DETAILS ABOUT AN ARREST



After  adding a new warrant,  PRS will return you to  the  MASTER 
MENU  SCREEN.   You're  now  ready to add the  details  about  an 
arrest.   In this case,  you'll want to choose the Arrest Records 
option.  Please enter your choice by typing '4'.



You  are  now looking at the ARREST SCREEN.  Notice  the  choices 
available  to  you  at the bottom of the screen.   You  can  ADD, 
SEARCH,  seek HELP or EXIT back to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.  Since 
you  want to add an arrest record,  enter your choice  by  typing 
'A'.



PRS  will  respond  by  changing the screen name  to  ARREST  ADD 
SCREEN,  displaying  a  message at the bottom of the  screen  and 
placing  the screen cursor at LAST NAME.   You may now enter  the 
details of a new arrest record.   



Go  ahead  and enter a make-believe arrest  record.   Please  use 
'TEST'  as  the  individual's last name.   Skip  the  fields  (by 
pressing the RETURN key) that you're unfamiliar with.   To return 
to a previous field,  use the BACKSPACE key.  For a complete dis-
cussion of all screen fields, please refer to Appendix C. 



Once  you've entered information in the last field, PRS will  ask 
"IS  THE ABOVE CORRECT ?  (Y/N)".   If you enter 'Y' PRS will now 
add  the arrest record to the ARREST master file.   If you  enter 
'N'  PRS will reposition the screen cursor at LAST NAME  so  that 
you may correct your entry.  Please enter 'Y'.



For a complete discussion about the  other options available when 
using Arrest Records,  please refer to Section E Arrest Records.  










                               46










ŠADD DETAILS ABOUT A CRIMINAL RECORD



After adding an arrest record,  PRS will return you to the MASTER 
MENU  SCREEN.   You're  now  ready to add  the  details  about  a 
criminal  record.   In  this  case,  you'll want  to  choose  the 
Criminal Records option.  Please enter your choice by typing '5'.



You  are now looking at the CRIMINAL SCREEN.   Notice the choices 
available  to  you at the bottom of the  screen.   You  can  ADD, 
SEARCH,  seek HELP or EXIT back to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.  Since 
you  want to add a criminal record,  enter your choice by  typing 
'A'.  By now you should be somewhat familiar with how records are 
added and changed.



PRS  will  respond  by changing the screen name to  CRIMINAL  ADD 
SCREEN,  displaying  a  message at the bottom of the  screen  and 
placing the screen cursor at LAST NAME. You may now enter the de-
tails of a new criminal record.   



Go  ahead and enter a make-believe criminal record.   Please  use 
'TEST'  as  the  individual's last name.   Skip  the  fields  (by 
pressing the RETURN key) that you're unfamiliar with.   To return 
to  a  previous field,  use the BACKSPACE  key.  For  a  complete 
discussion of all screen fields, please refer to Appendix C. 



Once  you've  entered information in the last field, PRS will ask 
"IS  THE ABOVE CORRECT ?  (Y/N)".   If you enter 'Y' PRS will now 
add  the  criminal record to the CRIMINAL master  file.   If  you 
enter  'N' PRS will reposition the screen cursor at LAST NAME  so 
that you may correct your entry. Please enter 'Y'.



For a complete discussion about the  other options available when 
using  Criminal  Records,  please  refer to  Section  E  Criminal 
Records.  









                               47









ŠPRINT A REPORT ABOUT OUTSTANDING WARRANTS




After successfully adding a criminal record,  PRS will return you 
to  the MASTER MENU SCREEN.   Let's complete the demonstration by 
creating a report about outstanding warrants.   To do so,  you'll 
need to have a printer attached to your computer,  turned on  and 
loaded with paper.



We want to create a report so please choose the Reports option by 
typing '6'.  PRS will display the REPORT MENU SCREEN, listing the 
reports  you may request.   We want to create an Outstanding War
rants report, so please enter '5'.



PRS now displays the OUTSTANDING WARRANTS REPORT SCREEN, advising 
you  to turn your printer on and to align your  paper.   You  are 
also  advised that you can avoid creating the report by  entering 
the word 'ABORT'.   Please press the RETURN key.  



The  Outstanding Warrants report should now be printing.   If  it 
doesn't,  check  to  see  that your  printer  is  working.   When 
finished, PRS will return you to the MASTER MENU SCREEN where you 
can choose to experiment further or to EXIT from PRS.



After  you've  become comfortable with using  the  delete  option 
within  each  of the PRS functions,  you may want to  delete  our 
demonstration  records  of  TEST so they do not  appear  in  your 
future reports.  

















                               48









ŠAPPENDIX B. MAKING A PERIODIC BACKUP OF YOUR MASTER FILES



Nothing  lasts forever.   To guard against the accidental loss of 
your  valuable data,  you should develop a habit of making a per-
iodic backup of your master files.

BUT I ALREADY MADE A BACKUP OF THE ORIGINAL PRS DISKETTES !

True...and you needn't make another backup of the ORIGINALS.  You 
will,  however,  be  constantly  adding new information  to  your 
master files (whether on a diskette or hard disk) which you  can-
not afford to lose.  Therefore, you need to make a periodic back-
up of your master files.



Please refer to your DOS manual for backup instructions.   If you 
need help, please call us.




HOW OFTEN TO BACKUP
-------------------



It's really up to you. Keep in mind that if your PRS MASTER FILES 
that you use on a daily basis are damaged, you will lose only the 
data since the last backup.



With  this  in mind,  many of you will choose to  perform  backup 
after  entering  a large amount of data,  so as not to  take  the 
chance of losing what's just been entered.   Another approach  is 
to  peform a periodic backup on a given schedule,  such as once a 
day at the end of the day, once a week, etc.




WHAT SHOULD BE BACKED-UP?
-------------------------



You should backup all files appended with .DBF and .NTX.





                               49









ŠSPECIAL NOTE ABOUT LARGE MASTER FILES
-------------------------------------


For  those of you with master files that are larger than can  fit 
on  one floppy diskette,  you'll have to use IBM's BACKUP command 
to accomplish the above.   If you have doubts as to how it works, 
please call us.



One way to tell if your master files have grown too large for one 
floppy diskette is to do the following:

   1.  List the directory of master files with the command...

       DIR *.DBF

   2.  Sum the size of each file.


   3.  List the directory of indices with the command...

       DIR *.NTX

   4.  Sum the size of each file and add to the earlier sum  for 
       master files.

   5. If  the  sum  of master files and indices  is  approaching 
      360,000 you are at or near the limit for 1 floppy diskette.

























                               50









ŠAPPENDIX C.  DEFINITION OF SCREEN FIELDS



In this section we'll review all the fields you will encounter in 
the Dispatch Records,  Cross Reference,  Warrant Records,  Arrest 
Records and Criminal Records functions.  



Again  a 'field' can be thought of as a single piece of  informa-
tion.   The definitions of most of these fields are self-evident.  
Several  have  particular definitions that are important  to  the 
proper use of PRS.



The fields will be presented by function,  giving its name,  size 
(how  long it can be),  type (numeric only or any combination  of 
alphabetic and numeric characters) and definition.   Whenever you 
see  the word 'optional' it means that you can choose whether  to 
use the field.




DISPATCH RECORDS SCREEN FIELDS


FIELD NAME    SIZE  TYPE                 DEFINITION
----------    ----  ----                 ---------- 


LAST NAME      15    AN     The last name of the individual 
                            making the dispatch call.  You must 
                            enter a last name to create a 
                            dispatch call.  The name can be
                            entered in upper or lower case.  PRS
                            will convert all names to upper case.
                            When searching  for a particular  
                            dispatch call, you can enter all or a
                            portion of the caller's name.

FIRST NAME     10    AN     The first name of the individual
                            making the dispatch call.  The name
                            can be entered in upper or lower
                            case.  PRS will convert all names to

                   DISPATCH HELP SCREEN


PURPOSE

The DISPATCH SCREEN may be used to keep a record of your dispatch
calls.  The details can be added as the dispatcher is taking the
call or later from a written record.  As new information is
received, the record may be updated.  The details of a dispatch 
record are available by choosing to search for an individual by 
last name. 

FUNCTION 

The DISPATCH SCREEN will allow you to ADD or SEARCH for the 
dispatch record.  When you choose to ADD a record, PRS will prompt 
you for details about the call.  At minimum, the individual's name 
must be entered.  When you choose to SEARCH for a dispatch call, PRS
will prompt you for the last name.  If the search is unsuccessful,
that means a record cannot be found for that individual.  Once the 
search is successful, you will be given the option to CHANGE the 
record, view the NEXT or PRIOR record, DELETE the record, print a 
HARDCOPY of the record or EXIT to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.

               CROSS REFERENCE HELP SCREEN 


PURPOSE

The CROSS REFERENCE SCREEN may be used to keep a record of local 
residents.  Generally, records are kept when a resident calls with 
a complaint, has a medical problem or has registered firearms.  As 
new  information  is received,  you will be able  to  update  the 
record.  The details of a cross reference record are available by 
choosing to search for an individual by last name. 

FUNCTION 

The CROSS REFERENCE SCREEN will allow you to ADD or SEARCH for the 
record of a local resident.  When you choose to ADD a record, PRS 
will prompt you for details about the resident.  At minimum, the 
individual's name must be entered.  When you choose to SEARCH for a 
resident, PRS will prompt you for the last name.  If the search is 
unsuccessful, that means a record cannot be found for that 
individual.  Once the search is successful, you will be given the 
option to CHANGE the record, view the NEXT or PRIOR record, print 
a HARDCOPY of the record, DELETE the record or EXIT to the MASTER 
MENU SCREEN.

PURPOSE 

The CRIMINAL SCREEN may be used to keep a record of criminal
records.  When you receive a written criminal record, you will
want to add the details to PRS.  As new information is received,
you will be able to update the record.  The details of a criminal 
record are available by choosing to search for an individual by 
last name. 


FUNCTION 

The CRIMINAL SCREEN will allow you to ADD or SEARCH for a
criminal record.  When you choose to ADD a record, PRS will 
prompt you for details of the criminal record.  At minimum, the 
individual's name must be entered.  When you choose to SEARCH 
for a criminal record, PRS will prompt you for the last name.  
If the search is unsuccessful, that means no criminal record 
can be found for that individual.  Once the search is successful, 
you will be given the option to CHANGE the record, view the NEXT 
or PRIOR record, print a HARDCOPY of the record, DELETE the 
record or EXIT to the MASTER MENU SCREEN.

Welcome to your new computerized Police Records System, or 'PRS' 
for short.   PRS provides 6 basic functions which you may find 
helpful on a day-to-day basis.  Briefly, these functions are: 

- DISPATCH RECORDS where you'll be able to add, view or update 
  details of dispatched calls. 
- CROSS REFERENCE where the details of local residents are kept. 
- WARRANT RECORDS where details of outstanding warrants are kept. 
- ARREST RECORDS where details of prior arrests are kept. 
- CRIMINAL RECORDS where details of prior criminal records are kept. 
- REPORTS where you'll be able to ask for and receive reports. 

The MASTER MENU SCREEN is your directory to all of the functions 
available within PRS.  You'll notice that each function is pre- 
sented to you with a preceeding number.  So, for example, if you 
want to add a dispatch record or just look at one, you can simply 
enter a '1'.  PRS will immediately present a new screen for 
adding or finding the dispatch record.
