                                  DISCLAIMER
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~

I, Tank04, the author, don't have the slightest idea what this stuff here
is all about.  I fell into some kind of trance while playing some nameless
game and when I woke back up (after a VERY long time) there was this
program & documentation on my hard drive. It seems I must have typed it
all (my fingers were covered with blisters and the print was rubbed off
of almost all the keys on my keyboard) while I was running around in another
world.

Anyway, I DO NOT take ANY responsibility for this document OR for the
corresponding program T4 or any of its related files or ANY damage, be it
direct, indirect, incidental or consequential, that may result from the use
of this program.  This sole purpose hereof is for stand-alone demonstration
and whatever YOU might do with it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  Don't blame me if
you use it for any type of illegal activity.  After all, YOU DID IT !  If
somehow your dog dies, some telephone company loosed revenue, or Earth 
leaves its orbit or anything else because of this program, 
                     
                     IT'S YOUR DAMNED FAULT, NOT MINE !

And as if that weren't enough : The author makes no warranties, expressed
or implied as to the quality or performance of this program.  Your use of
this program constitutes your agreement to this disclaimer and the release
of the author from any form of liability or litigation.

There ... I think that covers my rear end well enough !



                          The Idea Behind All This
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

T4 is an attempt to merge a COMFORTABLE and an extremely FLEXIBLE bluebox
into one program.

Most bluebox programs (any computer type) fall into two categories :

(A) The comfortable one.  Easy to use, but not allowing many sophisticated
    operations.

(B) The complicated one.  Usually quite flexible and also a pain in the A**
    to use.

T4 is different.  Using the correct settings, one does not need to worry
about tones, breakstrings, etc.  On the other hand, if you DO want to work
at a low level you can do that too (and very well I might add).

This program may be freely copied as long as it and this documentation are
not modified.  There is no such thing as a "registered" version, so all the
features available are here.



                            INSIDE THE PHONEDIRS               T4.DOC  - 2 -
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

T4 supports eight phonedirs which can hold up to 200 entries each.
Loading and saving is done automatically whenever you move to another
phonedir.


                       Moving Around in the Phonedirs
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
F1 .. F8
~~~~~~~~
The F-keys are used to load the corresponding phonedirs.

CrSr-Left & CrSr-Right
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These keys load the preceding/next phonedir.

CrSr-Up, CrSr-Down, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These keys let you move up and down inside the current phonedir.

Keys a - z
~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting (unshifted) keys a - z will select the next entry that begins with
that letter.



                      Editing Entries in the Phonedirs
                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
INS
~~~
Insert lets you INSERT a new entry into the current phonedir.

TAB
~~~
Tab lets you EDIT the highlighted entry.

CTRL-INS
~~~~~~~~
CTRL-INS COPIES the highlighted entry into the clipboard.

SHIFT-DEL
~~~~~~~~~
SHIFT-DEL CUTS the highlighted entry into the clipboard.  Use this to delete
entries.  (Careful !)

SHIFT-INS
~~~~~~~~~
SHIFT-INS PASTES the clipboard into the current phonedir.  Note : This can be
used to copy to and from DIFFERENT phonedirs.



                           Getting Sound out of T4             T4.DOC  - 3 -
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


As you might have already guessed, you need an Adlib or compatible
soundcard (Soundblaster [Pro] etc.) to be able to use T4 in other ways
than to only store telephone numbers and do local calls.


SPACE
~~~~~
Space plays break 1 of the highlighted entry.  Breaks can consist of up to
15 different tones, unlike most programs that only allow two or so.

ALT-SPACE
~~~~~~~~~
Plays break 2 of the highlighted entry.  This can be used for ADDITIONAL
tones that are sometimes needed, such as another "seize" tone.

CTRL-SPACE
~~~~~~~~~~
Plays break 3 of the highlighted entry.  Otherwise the same as ALT-SPACE.

LEFT-SHIFT-SPACE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plays break 4 of the highlighted entry.  Otherwise the same as ALT-SPACE.

RIGHT-SHIFT-SPACE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Plays break 5 of the highlighted entry.  Otherwise the same as ALT-SPACE.

ENTER
~~~~~
Finally !  Enter dials the highlighted number using the corresponding
settings.   Note : If the number begins with a "!", the prefix and suffix
defined in the settings will NOT be stuck onto that number.

CTRL-ENTER
~~~~~~~~~~
Does the same thing as Enter, EXCEPT that the number being dialed is
incremented by 1.  "Now what is this good for", I hear you say ?
One word : "Looplines" !

Keys A-Z, #, *, 0-9
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting (shifted) keys A - Z plays the defined tone for that letter.  Same
goes for # * 0-9.  Note : One setting (DTMF for example) can be LOCKED onto
the keyboard so that THAT setting will ALWAYS be played when the keys
mentioned above are pressed.  If no set is locked, the tones from the current
setting (highlighted entry) will be played.  Obviously, this does NOT affect
the breaks & dialing.



                            Other Useful Features              T4.DOC  - 4 -
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alt-D
~~~~~
Hitting Alt-D will start a Dos shell.  Type "EXIT" to return to T4.

BackSpace (QwikOut)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is another one of my better ideas.  QwikOut exits the program just as
ESC would, but in addition to that a series of keystrokes is placed in the
keyboard buffer.  You can use this to issue commands to the program (terminal
program) you called T4 from.  The string that's placed in the buffer can be
edited under "EDIT PREFS".  By the way, five different QwikOut strings are
available; the others are obtained by pressing ALT/CTRL-BackSpace.

NOTE : If the QwikOut string starts with an "!", the commands are NOT placed
in the keyboard buffer, but sent straight to the modem.  This is just what
you need when using T4 to call BBS's.  Use QwikOut to send "ATX3D^M" or
whatever to your modem, and let your terminal program take over from there.
If the string starts with "!!" then the string is issued to the modem without
exiting T4; for example you can send a "ATZ^M" without leaving the dialer.

Alt-T
~~~~~
Each phonedir has a title which is shown in the list at the bottom of the
screen as well on top of the screen when the phonedir is loaded.  Use Alt-T
to edit the title of the current phonedir.  This sure beats only having a
number for each phonedir as in most other bluebox programs.

SHIFT-CrSr-LEFT, SHIFT-CrSr-RIGHT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Flips through the different "views".  In other words shows you different
parts of the phonedir entries, such as name / number / note etc.

SHIFT-CrSr-UP, SHIFT-CrSr-DOWN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Allows you to remove the help display and phonedir listings from the screen,
giving you more lines for phonedir entries.


Alt-Z
~~~~~
This brings up a little menu that lets you send some common commands to your
modem (if configured properly in "EDIT PREFS").  The first block of commands
ATD, ATA etc works for all modems, the lower block is for Zyxel modems only.
Sorry, you HST, Supra and whatever-else guys out there.

Alt-L
~~~~~
This lets you select a setting that is locked over the settings entered in
the phonedir. Anotherwords, all dialing is done with the locked setting.  To
unlock, hit Alt-L again and then escape.



                        Format of the Phonedir Entries
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Name & Number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Undocumented feature. (haha)

Note
~~~~
This can be used to store additional information about the number, such as
a password for BBS's.

Setting
~~~~~~~
Basically, there are four different things that can be entered here :

(1) A-Z : This corresponds to the setting with that letter.
(2) "-" : This means that you wish to use the default setting, defined in
          "EDIT PREFERENCES".
(3) "*" : "*" means that this is a local number, to be dialed using the
          modem, turbopulse or the setting defined in "EDIT PREFS".
          See "LOCAL DIALING" on this.
(4) "?" : This will cause a menu with all available settings to appear.
          Use the cursor keys to select the one you want and hit Enter.


                             THE FREQUENCY SWEEPER
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting Alt-F will bring up the frequency sweeper window.  You can enter
9 parameters :

Frq1 Start, Increment, Stop at
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the scanning is started the first frequency will run from the "start"
value to the "stop at" value, incrementing by "increment".

Frq2 Start, Increment, Stop at
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These are the values for the second frequency.

Length
~~~~~~
This is the duration in milliseconds that each tone will be played.

Minimum Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the duration of silence between tones.  Note that the actual delay is
slightly longer than the entered value, due to the overhead in incrementing
the loops and updating the display etc. The dialroutines used for breaking
and dialing don't have this problem and are very precise. (+/- 0.2 mS !)

Volume
~~~~~~
Here you can enter the volume that will be used for scanning.  Maximum is 63.

Alt-B, Alt-N
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alt-B will make the counters do a step backwards. This is useful when you
are scanning and "something happend" and the scanner is already two steps
further.  Alt-B will move it back a step !  Alt-N is for the next step.

TAB & ESC
~~~~~~~~~
Tab starts the scanning.  Hit ESC to stop.



                           WHAT IS "LOCAL" DIALING ?           T4.DOC  - 5 -
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local dialing is using T4 to call numbers in one of three ways :

(A) Using your modem.
(B) Using a "normal" setting (usually D = DTMF).
(C) Using a relay that you can hook up to your computer, either to the
    speaker connector, printer port or any other port you might have.  T4
    sends impulses to the port, enabling a "manual" pulse dial.  The
    advantage of this method is that you can increase the speed of the
    dialing and you can dial those famous 11, 12, 13 etc. pulses (A - Z).


You can use local dialing to dial two different types of numbers :

(A) Toll free numbers (In Germany, 0130... for example).
(B) REAL local numbers (like your girlfriend across town).


The "*" setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a phonedir entry has "*" as its setting, its number will be dialed
locally. (Case B above)


The "<" and ">" keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting "<" will make T4 dial the local number stored in the "Local1" field
of the corresponding setting.  ">" is for the "Local2" number.


Once again, this is how it works : If you want to call a local number (Case
A above) associated with an entry in a phonedir, all you do is go to that
entry and press either "<" or ">".  A window will pop up informing you of the
dialing process and possible errors.

Alt-H
~~~~~
You can use Alt-H to either hang up the modem or make the relay hang up
your phone (depending on how you configured the local dial in EDIT PREFS).

COM ports & local dialprefixes & pulse-dial speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These things can be set in "EDIT PREFERENCES". (see next page)



                       THE "EDIT PREFERENCES" WINDOW I         T4.DOC  - 6 -
                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The things that are stored here are miscellaneous settings that are used
throughout the program.

QwikOut 1
~~~~~~~~~
Here you can edit the string that is placed in the keyboard buffer whenever
you leave the program via BackSpace.  Remember, if the QwikOut string starts
with an "!" the string is directly sent to the modem instead of being placed
into the keyboard buffer.
NOTE : CTRL-characters (CTRL-D for example) are entered like this : ^D.  The
escape key can be entered as ^[.  If you use QwikOut to send commands to your
modem, remember to place a ^M (Return) at the end of the string.

QwikOut 2
~~~~~~~~~
This is the same as QwikOut 1, except that the string here is called using
ALT-BackSpace.

QwikOut 3
~~~~~~~~~
This one is called using CTRL-BackSpace.

QwikOut 4
~~~~~~~~~
This one is called using LEFT-SHIFT-BackSpace.

QwikOut 5
~~~~~~~~~
This one is called using RIGHT-SHIFT-BackSpace.

Blanktime
~~~~~~~~~
Time in minutes for the screenblanker.  0 turns it off.

Vga 43/50
~~~~~~~~~
This determines whether the program runs in 25 or 43/50 line mode.

Default Set
~~~~~~~~~~~
When editing a phonedir entry, you can enter "-" as the setting.  Whenever
you dial that number the setting entered here (default) will be used.

Keypad Set
~~~~~~~~~~
This is the setting that is locked on the keyboard.  For example you can
have T4 use the D setting (normal touch tones) whenever you use keys on the
numeric keypad.  If instead you want T4 to use the settings of the current
entry, enter a "-" here and the string "Use Current" will appear.

Hold Tones
~~~~~~~~~~
If this is enabled, the tones played over the keyboard will be held until
the key is released.

Do delays
~~~~~~~~~
If set to "Yes", each time you play a tone by hitting a key ("1" for
example), no further keys are accepted for the time specified in the "delay"
field of that tone.



                     THE "EDIT PREFERENCES" WINDOW II          T4.DOC  - 7 -
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a setting letter is entered here it will be used for doing local calls.
Entering "-" will make T4 use your modem or the turbopulse feature instead.

Use modem
~~~~~~~~~
This item is only relevant if "-" has been entered in "local setting".
If this is set to "Yes" your modem will be used for dialing local calls,
otherwise the turbopulse feature will be used.

COM Port
~~~~~~~~
This should be the port your modem is attached to.  T4 will use this when
dialing via modem.  Note that your computers DOS & BIOS are used to
communicate with the serial ports.  See the "KNOWN PROBLEMS" appendix for
possible problems associated with this.

Modem Prefix
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the prefix (modem AT-command) that is used when dialing local
numbers.  Sensible settings are "ATDP" or "ATDT".

HangUp Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the time in milliseconds that the line connected to your computer
is interrupted to hang up the phone.

Make Time
~~~~~~~~~
This is the time that the line is connected or "made" for each pulse during
turbopulse dialing.

Break time
~~~~~~~~~~
The time that the line is disconnected or "broken" for each pulse.

Pause time
~~~~~~~~~~
The length of the pause between digits when using turbopulse.

Portadress (in Hex)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The address of the port used for turbopulse dialing is entered here.

 Port    Address     Make     Break
-------------------------------------
SPEAKER   $61      XXXXXX10  XXXXXX00
LPT1      $378     00000000  11111111   Note : The LPT addresses may vary !
LPT2      $379     00000000  11111111          Check your BIOS.

Make Bits
~~~~~~~~~
The bit sequence that is poked into the port when the line is supposed to
be "made".  This string is eight bits long and consists of "0", "1" and "X".
If a bit is set to "X" the value will not be changed when turbopulsing.

Break Bits
~~~~~~~~~~
The same as "Make Bits", except that this is for "breaking" the line.




                              EDITING THE SETTINGS             T4.DOC  - 8 -
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

T4 can handle 26 user definable settings.  Each one of those settings has :

(1) A letter used for selecting the setting. (A - Z makes 26 right ?)
(2) A name/title associated with it. (USA for example)
(4) A pre- and suffix that are place before and after numbers being dialed
    with that setting.
(3) Five breakstrings.
(4) Two local numbers (see "<" & ">") that can be dialed via modem.
(5) 39 user definable MF (multi frequency) tones that consist of :
    (1) 1st Frequency  (2) Length  (3) Delay  (4) 2nd Frequency  (5) Volume

The following settings are predefined but can be changed as liked :

C = CCITT#5    (Those funny french tones some countries use)
D = DTMF       (Touch tones)
U = USA        (This works pretty nicely for MCI USA from some countries)



                          The "Edit Settings" Window
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hitting Alt-S from the phonedir will bring up the "Edit Settings" window
with a menu of all available settings.


CrSr-Up, -Down, -Left, -Right, Home, End, a-z, *, -
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You probably can guess what the cursor keys do; the letters a-z and *, -
will take you to the corresponding setting.

CTRL-INS
~~~~~~~~
CTRL-INS will copy the highlighted setting into the clipboard.
This is of course a different clipboard than the phonedir uses.

SHIFT-INS
~~~~~~~~~
This will paste the clipboard into the highlighted setting.  Very useful
for creating new settings that are similar to existing ones.
Be careful ! You can easily wipe out your settings this way !

Alt-R
~~~~~
Revert.  In case you do mess up your settings by pasting too much, you can
hit Alt-R to reload the old version.

Enter, Alt-S
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting Enter or Alt-S again will let you edit the setting that is currently
highlighted.



                              The Setting Editor               T4.DOC  - 9 -
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This is the core of T4.  Here you can define up to 39 MF-tones for each
settings, as well as 5 different breaks.


MF-Tones
~~~~~~~~
MF-tones in T4 have the following format :

Frequency 1  30 - 9999  (Frequency of the 1st tone, 0 = OFF)
Length        0 - 9999  (Length of the tone in milliseconds)
Delay         0 - 9999  (Number of milliseconds to pause AFTER the tone)
Frequency 2  30 - 9999  (Frequency of the 2nd tone, 0 = OFF)
Volume        0 -   63  (Volume the MF-tone is played at)


Strings
~~~~~~~
The term "string" below and in T4 means "a sequence of MF-tones".


CrSr-Up, -Down, -Left, -Right, Home, End, a-z
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cursor keys let you move around the MF-tones.  Hitting a-z, will
take you to the corresponding tone.

Shift-A - Shift-Z, 0 - 9, #, *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hitting one of these key(-combinations) will play the corresponding tone.

Enter, Tab
~~~~~~~~~~
With ENTER or TAB you can edit the MF-tone that is currently highlighted.
The background color of that entry will change and you can use the cursor
and number-keys to move around and change the values for that tone.
Note : When editing DIALtones (usually 0-9 and A, B, C) it is recommended
to make them SLIGHTLY quieter than the BREAKtones.

CTRL-INS
~~~~~~~~
CTRL-INS will copy the highlighted MF-tone into the clipboard.

SHIFT-INS
~~~~~~~~~
This will paste the clipboard into the highlighted MF-tone.

Alt-R
~~~~~
Revert.  Once again, in case you screw up your settings, you can hit Alt-R
to reload the old version.



                              The Setting Strings              T4.DOC  - 10 -
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alt-E
~~~~~
Alt-E brings up a window where you can edit the setting strings.

What are the strings for ?

Title
~~~~~
Here you can enter a title for the setting.  This title is displayed next
to the setting letter in the "Select Settings" window as well as in the
phonedir.  (Example : "USA")

Prefix
~~~~~~
This the sequence of MF-tones that are dialed BEFORE every number that uses
this setting.  Note : If the number being dialed starts with "!" the prefix
and suffix will be obmitted.  (Example for a prefix : "A0")

Suffix
~~~~~~
Same thing as the prefix, except that this is dialed AFTER the number that
uses this setting.  (Typical example : "C")

BreakString 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here you can define a string that will be played (or dialed) whenever you
hit SPACE (from the phonedir) while on an entry that has this setting.
Note that breakstrings can consist of up to 15 MF-tones.

BreakString 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same as BreakString 1, except that this is played when ALT-SPACE is hit.

BreakString 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same as BreakString 1, except that this is played when CTRL-SPACE is hit.

BreakString 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same as BreakString 1, except that this is played when LEFT-SHIFT-SPACE is
hit.

BreakString 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Same as BreakString 1, except that this is played when RIGHT-SHIFT-SPACE is
hit.

Local 1
~~~~~~~
Under Local 1 you can store a "default" local number (toll free) that can
be accessed by the "<" key from the phonedir.  (See "LOCAL DIALING")

Local 2
~~~~~~~
Same as Local 1, except that this number is accessed by the ">" key.



                          How to Use the Modifier             T4.DOC  - 11 -
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is a "Modifier" ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This feature can be used to systematically modify some or all MF-tones of a
setting.  Lets say you have copied the USA setting and want to increase the
lengths and delays of ALL dialtones.  One way to do this would be to edit
each MF-tone individually.  This can be very tedious, especially if you do
this often.  The alternative is to use the modifier, which lets you double
or otherwise change the values with a single keystroke.

Alt-M
~~~~~
This brings up the modifier window.  From here you can define HOW you want
the MF-tones to be changed.  There are 2 fields for each parameter of the
tones.  The first one accepts the symbols =, +, -, *, / or can be left blank.
For example if you go to "Frequency1", enter '+' and then '100', the 1st
frequency of each MF-tone you modify with Alt-C will be incremented by 100 !
If you want to set the delay of certain MF-tones to a fixed value, lets say
70, you call the modifier, enter "=" and "70" at the "delay" field, and use
Alt-C to change the tones you want.  That's it !  All other fields will not
be changed.  The other operators -, *, / function in the same way.  If a
value over- or underflows its allowed range it will be clipped.

An Example :

Alt-C is used to actually CHANGE the tones according to the modifier defined
with Alt-M.  All you do is go to the tone you want to change and hit (or hold
down) Alt-C.



                          Some Words on Protection            T4.DOC  - 12 -
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to protect your numbers and maybe passwords (if you store them
under "Note") is to put everything on a virtual (hard) drive created with
Norton's DISKREET.  This program, part of the Norton utilities, uses
DES-encryption to transparently encode all files stored on its drives.


                    Known Problems and Ways Around Them
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) COM ports 3 & 4.  T4 uses DOS routines to communicate with the modem.
    The advantages are that I don't need to program the whole bulk of serial
    routines (and they are a mess, believe me) to accomplish this.  Also,
    the program would be a lot bulkier than it already is.
    The drawback is that some DOS/BIOS combinations don't recognize COM
    ports other than 1 and 2.  If your modem is on port 3 or 4 and you have
    this problem, you can use a short utility program to install these
    ports.  One such program I can recommend is called "34INSTAL.ZIP".  Look
    for this utility in the PD-section.

(2) Modem dialing.  I haven't yet found a safe way to poll the modem for
    result codes.  Anotherwords, all dialing is "blind".  If the modem
    returns an "No dial tone", T4 won't catch it.  Besides, you must listen
    to your modem to tell when you should pick up your phone, as T4 can't
    poll the "OK." message from the modem when dialing is completed.
    This is something I intend to fix if I can get information on it from
    somebody.  (You maybe ?)

(3) Baud rate.  I haven't encountered this, but it is theoretically
    possible that when T4 initiates communication with the modem the baud
    rate is locked to 2400 or whatever the default is.  If this appears
    to be a problem (using QwikOut with "!"), use the MODE command to
    configure the baud rate of your COM port to the correct value.  That
    should fix it.

(4) Fossil drivers.  QwikOut may not work with some fossils.  Try and see.
    I plan on fixing this if it is doable without mountains of work.


T4 has been thoroughly tested by myself and been used during the development
by ten beta-testers (well, beta-users).  If you find any bugs please let me
know of them as soon as possible.

If you have any comments or suggestions let me hear them !



                           Hard/Software Requirements         T4.DOC  - 13 -
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You need a soundcard that is Adlib compatible for T4.  A soundblaster (pro)
is not needed. (But will work just as well, or better, of course)

You need MS DOS (or compatible) version 3.10 or newer.  T4 will NOT work
on older DOS versions.



                                 Installing T4
                                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Very simple.  The best way to do this is to create a directory and copy or
unpack all the files into it, for example C:\MODEM\T4.
Then, go into your DOS directory, or any directory that is included in your
PATH command and create a batch file T4.BAT to call the program :

@ C:\MODEM\T4\T4

Note : If you are using DOS version 3.2 or 3.1 obmit the "@".

That's it !  Now you can type "T4" from anywhere on your hard disk and T4
will be started.

Note : It is NOT necessary to change to the directory that T4 is located in,
to start the program.  T4 automatically loads all its files from the
directory it was STARTED from, in the above example C:\MODEM\T4.



                          Starting T4 from Telemate
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most comfortable way to do this is to use a macro.  If you use
an Alt-FKey or a Ctrl-FKey, you can call T4 from anywhere in Telemate.
So go into the "Macro" menu, select "Alt-Key" and pick a key which you want
to use to call T4.  Then enter the following string (without the quotation
marks) : "^=T4^M^[".  This tells Telemate to go to the dos shell, call T4,
and close the shell again.  Don't forget to save your macros !
