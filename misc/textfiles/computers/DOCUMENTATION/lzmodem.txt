Welcome to Lightning Z-Modem 1.01, this program is a breakthrough
in transfer protocol!  Many utilities today claim to boost your
modem speed, but in reality they are not effective and in some
cases they are hoaxes!

Introducing our new L-Zmodem 1.01, this advanced state of the
art lightning fast transfer protocol will save you $100's of dollars in modem
upgrades!  This is probably the LAST protocol you will ever need!

It took 3 years of research and programming to create this protocol.

WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS ZMODEM ?
======================================

Regular Z-Modems will usually transfer at average between 1500-1600 CPS!
Some Z-Modems will transfer even up to 1800 CPS! on a 14.4K modem!   We
discovered that Z-Modem protocol has built-in hidden features and it
is actually possible to make use of this hidden feature.  This makes
L-Zmodem 1.01 compatible with *ANY* version of regular Z-Modem!

This new transfer protocol will not only assure CLEAN error-free
transfer but it will actually transfer at speeds 4-10 times faster
than regular Z-MODEM !!!

TECHNICALLY THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE !
================================

When we first released this program, we got many letters from modem
companies, individuals, companies and BBS System Operators telling
us that this is all a *HOAX* and it can't be possible on a 14.4k modem !!!
 
Of course we do understand that it is IMPOSSIBLE!   The secret most
people do not know is, the way L-Zmodem 1.01 operates!  We are not
about to reveal the formula, but we will explain to you the basics
of how this all works.

I'm sure you have heard of Fractal Compression ?  No ?   Well this
technology was experimented a few years ago with no success as the
compression technique would be too slow and often it would be
almost impossible to decompress the compressed file also resulting
in decompressed files being corrupt.   We have worked upon this
technology and improved it.   We use special compression modules
that work in conjonction with your V42 BIS and LAP-M modem protocols
to provide the best compression possible.   Not only that, with
artificial intelligent realtime block-compression technique
we are able to compress data a fraction of its size before being
sent through the com port.  We do not use only fractal compression
here as it is mostly used as an experiment on image files.   When
sending a file through modem, the software will constantly ANALYSE
the file being sent and determine the best compression method!
Other complex methods are used also!
 
AGAIN THIS SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE!
=============================

We have eliminated all the overhead associated with regular Z-modem!
adding our own 16 BIT CRC check!  Why not 32 BIT ?   To save overhead
time we have included another 16 BIT CRC check within the
compression/decompression, all in 100% ASM code for fast operation!

LET'S TALK RESULTS NOW!
=======================

The importance here is NOT in the way L-Zmodem 1.01 works, it's
the results it gives!     L-Zmodem 1.01 will work as a stand-alone
protocol from DOS, or can be used and integrated with virtually
*ANY* terminal program or BBS software, easally, either using
BATCH FILES or direct calls !!!

It's not necessary for both parties to have L-Zmodem 1.01 installed,
but the speed will be normal Z-MODEM!   In order to assure 100% accuracy,
an increased speed and a clean transfer, you HAVE to have L-Zmodem 1.01 
installed on both end to assure compatibility !

Here's the results you can expect when using L-Zmodem 1.01 protocol
in both ends.

PLEASE NOTE:  This transfer protocol will work ONLY with 14400 baud modems!
set in V42 BIS LAP-M, and preferably clean lines!

AVERAGE CPS RATE

Regular un-compressed image, sound,        15000-20000 CPS
documents, and other files                 (No mistake here !!)
                                           Results vary according
                                           to different file types

Tightly-compressed .ZIP,.ARJ,.LZH          4000-7000 CPS
and other compressed files                 The file is DE-COMPRESSED     
                                           and re-compressed using our
                                           special module, all is done
                                           in realtime!

NOTE:  If both ends do not have L-Zmodem 1.01, for example the user
has L-Zmodem 1.01, and remote has ZMODEM, then L-ZMODEM will
transfer at regular ZMODEM speed since it is backward compatible
with ALL ZMODEM protocol!

There is no special knowledge needed to use this protocol, it
is FULLY AUTOMATIC, and will detect if it's being used from
DOS or on a BBS system!

Always make sure you have your COM PORT BAUD RATE set at 57600
eventhough you have a 14.4k modem!

STILL NOT CONVINCED ?
=====================

Please do not think to yourself that a 14.4k modem cannot
transfer at speeds more than 14.4k!   The hardware part cannot
of course.

BUT HOW CAN YOUR L-ZMODEM PROTOCOL SURPASS THE 28.8k and even the 57.6K?
========================================================================

Usually the 14.4K V42 BIS modem has a throughout capacity of 57.6Kbauds!
So how can data be sent FASTER ?  Actually IT WON'T data will be
sent at SAME SPEED!

It's all in the way the data is sent.  Please remember that when
you get high CPS speeds, your modem technically is NOT running
faster, it cannot, that's impossible, it is simply sending data
differently, the data is being shortened before it's sent
so it's sent in reduced size and de-compressed on the remote end.
