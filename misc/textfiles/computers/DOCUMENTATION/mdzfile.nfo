                          MDZ Information File v1.01
                        ==============================

General:
========

  MDZ-files are files that describe modules. They give the reader some
  general information about one or several modules and enables him to
  find the module he just wants to listen to quickly. They are meant to
  be spread along with modules (in archives, on cds), so everyone can easily
  find out who has made this piece of music or what style it is.
  The MDZ-format was designed to be accessible from every module related
  program, it is explicitly not limited to Cubic Player (see below for
  a description of the format).
  I'd like to encourage you to use these files in your own productions
  (modules as well as players or trackers).


Format:
=======

  The MDZ-file is a standard ibm ascii file. Every MDZ-file has to
  start with the text "MODINFO1" (1 is the version number). The files
  currently may not be bigger than 64k.
  Then there may be one data field per line. Currently defined fields
  are:

    MODULE    xxxx         the filename of the module
    SIZE      xxxx         the filesize of the module

                        MODULE and SIZE are used for indentifying
                        the module! Together they start a new module block.
                        All other information on this module must be below.

    TYPE      xxxx        the type of the module (4 characters max)
    FDATE     dd.mm.yyyy  file date
    TITLE     xxxx        title of the module
    COMPOSER  xxxx        composer
    CDATE     dd.mm.yyyy  date when the module was finished
    STYLE     xxxx        style
    PLAYTIME  mmm:ss      playtime
    COMMENT   xxxx        comment for this module
    ;         xxxx        comment (ignore this line)

  Other lines will be ignored.
  Valid and planned types are:
    MOD      standard module (all types)
    MODd     standard module with DMP-like panning
    MODt     standard module where command Fxx is always tempo
    M15      15 instruments module without a signature
    M15t     15 instruments module, Fxx is tempo
    MID      Midi file
    MIDd     Midi file, channel 16 is a drum channel
    XM       FastTracker II module
    STM      ScreamTracker 2 Module
    S3M      ScreamTracker 3 Module
    PTM      PolyTracker module
    MTM      MultiTracker module
    669      Composer 669 module (also extended 669)
    DMF      X-Tracker module
    OKT      Oktalyser module
    MDL      Digitracker module
    AMS      Extreme's tracker module
    FAR      Farandole module
    WOW      Mod's Grave module
    ULT      UltraTracker module
    CDA      CD-Audio track (size is some kind of checksum on all tracks)

    AMF      DMP's internal format
    MED      MED module
    PSMa     Protracker Studio 16 (PSMþ)
    PSMb     Protracker Studio 16 newer version

Cubic Player and MDZ-files:
===========================

   With Cubic Player you can load, edit and save MDZ-files.
   Cubic Player automatically reads all MDZ-files it finds, that are not
   bigger than 64k, and even ZIP packed MDZ files with a maximum size of 1k,
   and converts them into an internal format. To edit the information
   in the fileselector you must press shift-tab, select the field you want
   to edit, press return, edit the field, press return again and then
   shift-tab. To save the information of one module press alt-w and cp
   will write it to a with the same name, but with the extension .MDZ.
   You can also write a MDZ file of many modules: put the modules in the
   playlist, press tab to go to the playlist, press alt-a and enter
   the filename of the new MDZ file. (pressing alt-a in the directory will
   make a MDZ file of all modules in the current directory)


Software that uses this format:

  ah... it's getting more and more...
