INTRODUCTION

This README file describes the requirements and setup necessary to get
MORIA running on your MSDOS computer.  The actual game documentation is
in MORIA.DOC.  Some of the game documentation will be wrong if you
choose the Rogue-like command set.


1. USAGE

     Usage:  moria [ -nors ] [ savefile ]

     Where:  -n starts a new game, ignoring any existing save files.
             -o selects the original (VMS) command set.
             -r selects the Rogue-like command set.
             -s prints the score file and exits.

2. REQUIREMENTS

     640K ram (really!)
     DOS 2.x or higher
     2 - 360K floppy disk drives or 1 high density drive or 1 hard drive
     A 24 (or 25) line by 80 column monitor.  MORIA uses either BIOS calls
     or ANSI for video output so should work properly on most monitors. 
     It must use ANSI to work on DEC Rainbows.  It won't work in 43-line mode
     of an EGA.


3. INSTALLATION

MORIA is very easy to configure.  The biggest problem is that there is
not enough room on a single 360K floppy disk to hold the DOS system
files, MORIA.EXE (about 340K) and a MORIA save file (about 80K or so).
To install MORIA, some files must be copied and 2 options in MORIA.CNF
must be set.  Options and the MORIA.CNF are described more fully in the
section entitled OPTIONS.  Here are a few methods of configuration.
These methods are also described in the MORIA.CNF file.


3.1. Hard drive systems

Create a c:\games subdirectory on your hard disk and put c:\games on
your PATH (see the DOS manual if you need help with PATH). Copy
MORIA.EXE and MORIA.CNF to c:\games.  Edit MORIA.CNF and put in the
options:

     SAVE c:\games\moria.sav;n
     SCORE c:\games\moria.scr






                                 - 1 -                                     

3.2. High-density floppy systems

This is about as easy as for a hard disk.  Format a diskette and put the
DOS system files on it (use FORMAT A:/S).  Copy MORIA.EXE and MORIA.CNF
to that diskette.  Edit MORIA.CNF and put in the options:

     SAVE a:\moria.sav
     SCORE a:\moria.scr



3.3. 2 - 360K floppy systems

You will need to use 2 floppy diskettes.  Format a diskette and put the
DOS system files on it (use FORMAT A:/S).  Copy MORIA.CNF to this
diskette. This diskette will go in drive A when you want to play MORIA.
Format a second diskette (no /S) and copy MORIA.EXE to it.  This
diskette will go in drive B.  Edit MORIA.CNF and put in the options:

     SAVE a:moria.sav
     SCORE a:moria.scr


When you want to play MORIA, put both diskettes in and type "B:MORIA"



4. OPTIONS

When MORIA starts up it looks along your PATH for the file "MORIA.CNF".
MORIA.CNF contains configuration information for MORIA in the form of
options.  Options have a name and perhaps a value.  If the option
doesn't have a value, simply mentioning its name selects that option.
Here are the options.

4.1. SAVE

The SAVE option has 1 argument, the name of a file where saved games
will be stored.  Normally, when you start MORIA by typing "MORIA file",
MORIA will try to use "file" as the name of a saved game.  The SAVE
option allows you to give the name of the save file so you don't have to
type it in each time you save or restore a game.  A sample SAVE option
is:

     SAVE c:\games\moria.sav;n


The ";n" is optional.  If given it means that MORIA should never prompt
you for the name of the save file.  If the SAVE option isn't given,
MORIA defaults to the file MORIA.SAV in the same directory as MORIA.CNF.
Also, the SAVE option can be just ";n", which means use the default name
without prompting.





                                 - 2 -                                     

4.2. SCORE

The SCORE option has 1 argument, the name of the file where the top
scores are kept.  A sample SCORE option is:

     SCORE c:\games\moria.scr


If the SCORE option isn't given, MORIA defaults to the file MORIA.SCR in
the same directory as MORIA.CNF.


4.3. KEYBOARD

MORIA can be played with either of 2 styles of commands.  There is the
original VMS-style commands and a Rogue-style set of commands. The
choice of command set affects the keyboard letters used for doing the
various game commands.  The KEYBOARD value can be either "ROGUE" or
"VMS".  The default is to use the original VMS-style commands.


4.4. GRAPHICS

The GRAPHICS option takes 2 arguments, the ASCII number for the
character to be used for displaying the walls and floors.  For example,
to use '#' for the walls and '.' for the floors, the GRAPHICS option
would be:

     GRAPHICS 35 46


Incidentally, these also are the default characters that are used if the
GRAPHICS option is not specified.


4.5. RAWIO

Normally DOS does some extra work whenever a character is input from the
keyboard.  One of the tasks is to interpret the special characters ^S
(control-S, which does a scroll lock) ^C (control-C, which acts like
control-Break) and ^P (control-P, which acts like control-PrtSc,
toggling output to your printer or giving an error message if you don't
have one). The RAWIO option will be used to tell DOS to not do this
extra work by making the input (and output) operate in "raw" mode. This
is good because ^P (a MORIA command) will now work. As well, screen
output will be somewhat faster.

URGENT!  RAWIO will not work on Dec Rainbows and will probably lock up
the computer.


4.6. IBMBIOS

IBMBIOS enables the use of a BIOS call to read input from the keyboard.



                                 - 3 -                                     

The advantage of this is that the numeric keypad will then be useable as
direction keys for moving around.  With this option the keypad keys map
to the directions:

             7 up & left      8 up        9 up & right
             4 left           5 nothing   6 right
             1 down & left    2 down      3 down & right

     And other keypad keys map to:

                                          -   rest
                                          +   previous message
             Ins inventory        Del rest


If you are using the Rogue-style command set, the shift key and NumLock
key modify these commands. With the shift key down, 7 will be "run up
and left", 8 will be "run up", etc.  The NumLock key is used as a toggle
between moving and tunneling. With NumLock enabled, 7 will be "tunnel up
and left", etc.


4.7. ANSI

The ANSI option tells MORIA to use ANSI sequences rather than using BIOS
calls for doing output.  You must use the ANSI option if you are playing
MORIA on a DEC Rainbow.  On IBM PCs, ATs and clones there should be no
need to use this option and you can safely ignore the rest of this
section.

The ANSI option takes three optional arguments:  check_ansi, move_opt and
use_tgoto.  If no arguments aren't given, they are assumed to be Y (yes),
Y and N (no), respectively.  The usage is

     ANSI [ check_ansi [ move_opt [ use_tgoto ] ] ]

An example is:

     ANSI Y N

check_ansi tells MORIA to check for ANSI.SYS when starting up.  You may have
to disable this check if MORIA insists you don't have ANSI installed, but you
know you do.  move_opt tries to reduce the amount of output being sent to the
screen.  use_tgoto tells MORIA to use the actual TERMCAP tgoto() routine.  The
default is to use a faster routine which only works for ANSI-like terminals.

When the ANSI option is chosen, MORIA looks for ANSI control strings in
a file called TERMCAP, first in the current directory, then in directory
ETC.  A sample TERMCAP file is supplied.  Basically, this file maps
between logical cursor operations (eg. "cursor up") to ANSI sequences
(eg ESC [ A).  In the file, ESC (escape) is represented as \E.  MORIA
uses the following logical operations:





                                 - 4 -                                     

     ce      clear to end of line
     cl      clear screen
     cm      cursor motion (only if use_tgoto is chosen)
     nd      cursor forward (non-destructive space)
     bc      cursor back
     up      cursor up
     xd      cursor down
     li      number of lines on the screen

MORIA can also use:

     ti      terminal initialization string
     te      terminal end string


5. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

MORIA uses the environment variable USER to determine your real name (as
opposed to your role playing name in the game).  The USER environment
variable can be set from DOS with:

     set USER = kneller

If the USER variable isn't set, MORIA just uses the name "player".

If the ANSI option is chosen, MORIA uses the variable TERM to determine
the terminal information to extract from the TERMCAP file.  If the TERM
variable isn't set, MORIA assumes the value "ibmpc-mono".



6. BUGS

I have not played this game much so there may be bugs which I have not
seen yet.  Please report them to me so I can fix them.
