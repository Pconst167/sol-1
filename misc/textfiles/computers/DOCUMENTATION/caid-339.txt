Old Release notes :    version 2.10 to 2.47
===================

2.47.00  Removed pause screen from start.

2.47.01  There are 76 new cracks added to CRACK1.DAT.

2.47.02  Following request have allowed backspace to be used when typing
         in directory name.

2.47.03  Have included a 'Special Case' dialogue screen for one crack
         that require specific intructions.

2.47.04  Fuck me!!. I had some feedback on one of the cracks.
         If the Trump Castle 2 crack doesn't find the byte change
         necessary.... try changing the file TC2.EXE..
         Hex offset 2229B to EB 02  (Hex 2229B should be 9A if not don't use)
         Hex offset 232C7 to 31

2.47.05  CRACKAID.COM has become CRACKAID.EXE due to me exceeding the 64k
         *.COM boundary.It LZ'exes to under 7k now!!

Version 2.47 to 2.70
====================

2.70.01  Have added 19 new cracks to CRACK1.DAT

2.70.02  Have altered a typing error in crack for Terminator 2.

2.70.03  Have included a couple of cracks in MORECRAC.KS

2.70.04  er..  that's all I could be bothered to do.


Despite me saying that version 2.47 would be the last release, I have decided
to release this version, primarily as a bug fix for the Terminator 2 crack.
Thought I might as well add another page load of cracks while I was at it.


Version 2.70 to 3.39
====================

3.39.01  Have added 57 new byte cracks to CRACK1.DAT

3.39.02  Have replaced MORECRAC.KS with CALOAD.EXE to create a handful
         of loader and TSR patches

3.39.03  Have amended a typo in Bad Blood byte patch.

3.39.04  As this is the last full version of CrackAid, I have tried to
         the executable file inside the 64k COM boundary. Subsequently,
         the file copy section of code has been trimmed (even further), and
         users may notice this version takes longer to backup the original
         file.

Feedback
========

Surprise, Surprise.... Fuck all, not a sausage.

Further comments
=================

This is definately the last major of release of CrackAid. I am teaming up
with Randall Flagg of Razor 1911 and creating a similar thing under a new
title. The graphics, presentation will obviously be greatly improved, as will
the number of titles (600 or so).

This program will be released as SHAREWARE (whatever that is!!!), and will
also be registerable for a small fee.
At the time of this doc., the final details (including the title), of this new
project are as yet unresovled, but look out for it a board near you soon.

Part of the service of the new project will involve free protection removal for
people with software that has protection in it.


Adieu, Rawhide -=The Humblest of them All=-

Usual old crap
==============

The sole intention of this software is to remove the annoyance of having
to dig out your manual/code-wheel/key diskette everytime you want to play
a game. Also for legimate purchasers of software who have mislaid their
manual amongst all the other crap round their PCs.

It is certainly NOT my intention, that anyone should use this software to
make/distribute illegal copies of software. If you are using this program
for this purpose, then you are very naughty indeed.

Please do not use this software to deprive those smashing ladies and
gents of the software houses, with their BMWs and 5 bedroom detatched houses
in the stockbroker belt out of their hard-earned cash. Support them.


Personal/Group Greets:  Hi.T, Byrn and all at THG, Razor Blade, Randall
Flagg and all at Razor 1911, all other groups too numerous to mention, and
everybody in whole world except Bob Monkhouse, who's a cunt.
