
                  PUBLIC DOMAIN AND SHAREWARE LIBRARIES

  Distributors of "public domain" or user-supported software libraries
  must obtain written permission to distribute copies of NAG-BUSTER. No 
  one may use NAG-BUSTER as a promotion for any commercial venture or as 
  an enticement for the user to pay for any program, product, or service
  unless they have received the express written permission of the
  program's author.

  In order to distribute NAG-BUSTER, a dealer or disk vendor must comply
  with the following conditions:

     1)  You must obtain written permission from author Erik Famm 
         if you wish to distribute NAG-BUSTER. Please use the vendor 
         application at the end of this document. If you receive no 
         reply, write again: my silence does NOT constitute permission,
         and you may not distribute "pending" receipt of permission.

     2)  A maximum disk fee as set by Erik Famm in the vendor
         contract must not be exceeded. NAG-BUSTER may not be included
         on any disk sold for more than this maximum. Major CD-ROM
         or optical disk libraries are exempt from this restriction,
         provided that they have the author's permission to distribute
         NAG-BUSTER.

     3)  Vendors may not modify or delete ANY files on the disk.
         Vendors may add a "GO" program, and/or a reasonable number
         of small text files designed to assist or provide a service
         to the user, but these added files must be easily identifiable
         and end-users must be allowed to delete the added files.

    (4)  Vendors must make a reasonable effort to distribute only the
         most recent versions of NAG-BUSTER. All vendors who have 
         requested and received written permission to distribute 
         NAG-BUSTER will receive new MAJOR releases as they are issued.

    (5)  When vendor catalogs or advertisements carry both Shareware
         and PD programs, the Shareware programs must be differentiated
         from the public domain programs in some way (in the
         description, with an asterisk, by listing the registration fee,
         etc.). NAG-BUSTER isn't a shareware program, but should 
         nevertheless be listed together with shareware programs.

    (6)  You must enclose US$ 10 or NOK 50 in cash for expences.

  NOTE TO ALL PROSPECTIVE DEALERS:

  In order that I can verify that you are a legitimate shareware vendor,
  I request that you include a copy of your product catalog with this
  application, along with a blank diskette and mailer. Once you have
  been approved, you will receive written permission from us to
  include NAG-BUSTER in your library for distribution. Additionally, you
  will receive your diskette back containing the latest NAG-BUSTER release.

  I am also requesting that you send me revisions of your catalog as they
  are published. The main reason behind this is that a mailing list of
  active vendors will be maintained.  My continued receipt of your
  catalog will both enable me to verify that you have the most recent
  NAG-BUSTER release (within reason), as well as know that your business 
  is still active.

  When major revisions are made to the program, I will send you the
  latest upgrade so that your library is kept up to date.
