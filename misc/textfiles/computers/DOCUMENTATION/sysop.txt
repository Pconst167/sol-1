The BBS Crash On-Line Game is distributed as SHAREWARE. Under this concept
you may use the SHAREWARE (unregistered) version for a reasonable period of
time, which I consider to be two weeks, after which you must either register
your copy or discontinue usage.
      
      
      
      
Distribution
============
You are free, in fact encouraged, to distribute the SHAREWARE (unregistered)
version of BBS Crash! On-Line Game provided that all files contained in the
original BBS Crash! archive are distributed in their original unmodified state.
