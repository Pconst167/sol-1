		  Dvpeg 3.0l - dvpeg.doc file
		  ---------------------------------

Use:  Dvpeg is a DOS based (286 or up) JPEG / GIF / Targa / PPM viewer
	(limited BMP support)
	that will run under DOS, Windows, OS\2.


  Limitations
  -----------
  Viewing of JPEG, some Targa and all PPM images require a 15/16/24 bit
  video card for speed and image quality.  JPEG images can be viewed on
  256 color modes but will take longer to decode.  Targa and PPM images
  can be viewed on 256 color modes but they will be in grayscale.  If the
  original image was color the red portion is used to set the brightness.

  16 color modes are supported as color or gray.  Nothing less (ie
  monochrome) is supported.


  Speed
  -----
  For maximum speed set the shrinking to 1:1
  You can always shrink the picture after, if the panning is on.
  For faster JPEGs on 16 color modes turn off the quantizing (default).
  For speed on 256 or 16 color card use 1 pass quantize, no dithering
	 or grayscale viewing.
  For faster scans of directories turn off the "4DOS info" and "file info".


  JPEG Image Quality
  ------------------
  Best quality for 16 & 256 color video mode JPEGs is 2 pass quantizing.
  The JPEG medium/high quality switch will usually show no difference.
  But the high quality setting is slightly more accurate and slower.


To run dvpeg use:
 dvpeg <file_path>\<file_mask>
  ie dvpeg ..\gifs\new\*.jpg
	or
 dvpeg <options> <@file> <picture_file(s)>
  ie dvpeg +mask *.jpg  [this is the same as dvpeg *.jpg]
  ie dvpeg +initshow *.jpg <+addslide joey.tga> +slideshow
		 this setups up theslide show, adds all *.jpg files the joey.tga and
		 then runs the slideshow


where anything in "<>" is optional

For example using:  dvpeg +title "*This is it" stars.gif +exit
  will show the picture file stars.gif with the title 'This is it',
  pause for a keypress and then exit.

The @file is called a response file. DOS is limited to lines of 256
characters.  If you wish to have very long files of options then you can
put all of the options into a text file and simply give the viewer the
name of the file.  One option per line of the response file.


Options on the command line or response file
--------------------------------------------
Each option must start with one of the following characters:

; -> start of a comment line in the response file (line is ignored)
+ -> turns an option on
- -> turns an option off
* -> the rest of this arguement is a text string (only used for the
		 title to be displayed or the text line; nothing else
Anything else is assumed to be the a filename for viewing

For each option you must use at least the first 3 characters.
For each of the lines a # symbol means that a number is expected.

NOTE:  There is a difference between response files and command line
options.  For example on the command line you need double quotes around
character strings while they are not required for response files.
  ie on the command line: +name "*copyright message here"
	  or the response file: +name *copyright message here

All options require a + or - prefix.


External Control Options (not available in the viewer)
------------------------------------------------------
config	-> the name of the configuration file must follow this

clscreen	-> setup, clear the text screen and print title

notext	-> do not return to text screen when exiting DVPEG
	-> this will leave the picture on the screen in graphics mode

name	-> with this you can set the name printed in the lower left corner
	-> if a text string follows it will be used as the string to print
	-> otherwise the file name is used
	-> ie -name or +name or +name *This is the file name

title	-> this allows you to print a title to the top, center of the screen
	-> if a text string follows it will be used, if there is no string
	-> then the 4DOS file description is the default

controls  -> turn pause after decoding picture on/off (on = no pause)
	-> this is reset to pausing after a slideshow
	-> pausing means waiting for a keypress

usefiles	-> don't clear the list of files added to the slideshow list
	-> this means the slideshow files will be the only ones on the
	-> file list when it pops up

exit	-> this will result in an immediate exit from the viewer, it will
	-> not set the text screen unless the notext option is off!


Control Options (changable within the viewer)
---------------------------------------------
nolist -> turn off the file selection list,  The user then has 3 options;
	 ESC to exit, RTN and N for next picture, P for previous picture.
	 No other options exist.

delay #  -> the delay between pictures in the slideshow

keypress -> wait for an immediate keypress

lock #  -> This will lock/unlock the viewer into using one video resolution
	-> for example +lock 480 will lock it into the 640 * 480 mode for
	-> all pictures, -lock will turn it off -> no number is expected

menu  -> this will turn the menu on ie where you can select the video
	-> resolution and change some options like panning

beep  -> turn the end of picture beep on or off

mask  -> if + add a file mask to the list (maximum 5 currently)
	-> if - then clear the list of file masks

tree -> turn file tree on/off

drives -> turn list of drives on/off

long -> toggle file list between short/long

fifty -> turn 50 line text mode on/off

clgr -> turn clear_graphics_screen_before_draw on/off

path -> set the file drive, path used by the viewer ie d:\pics\new
	-> do not use a \ at the end
	-> other examples:  \\gifs\new  ie hop back to the root but keep drive
	->  or ..\test\pics ie hop back one branch and add to it
	->  or pics\new  ie add to the current dir. path (don't need .\)


Slideshow Options
-----------------
initshow -> initialize the slideshow and clear the list of files
	-> this must be called before any slideshow files are put into
	-> the list

addslide -> add a file name to the slideshow

slideshow -> start the slideshow of the given file names
	 -> it will exit if the user hits ESC or there is a file error
	 -> on a severe error the viewer may terminate
	 -> the continous slideshow flag is cleared upon exiting the show

continous -> if used before slideshow the show will run continously


Viewing Options
---------------
-shrink   -> turn automagic shrinking on/off (shrink to fit video mode by
+shrink #	-> using 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, .. 1/6
	-> if the shrinking is being turned on the it must be followed with
	-> a number, 0 = automatic, anything else will lock the shrink ratio

panning	-> turn the panning ability on/off
	-> this can use a lot of memory and take time
	-> do not use this when doing a slideshow since the user can not
	-> (currently) do any panning or adjust any controls


JPEG Options
------------
grayscale -> turn grayscale viewing for JPEGs on/off

quantize	-> turn 2 pass quantizer on/off

dithering	-> turn JPEG dithering on/off



Memory requirements
-------------------
  GIF viewing typically requires 190,000 bytes.
  JPEGs take 174,000 + X size * 144  (X size is the width of the picture)

  If the image is going to be panned then even more memory (EMS, XMS, ..)
  is required.  In the case of 640 * 480 picture in a 15/16 bit mode
  (ie hi-color) then another 1M of memory is required.  If this can not
  be found the program will use temporary files on the harddrive (slow).
  Extra memory for panning is simply:  X size * Y size * bytes per pixel.
	 Where 16, 256 color is 1 byte/pixel
		 15/16 bit are 2 bytes/pixel
		 24 bit is 3 bytes/pixel

Memory Problems
---------------
  If you are running out of far memory then you should reduce the size of
  the file list (under F7).  The default is 500, maximum is 2,000 and it
  takes about 50 bytes/item.

  Slideshow memory problems can be caused by using the decode to buffer.
  This can require a lot of memory and should not be used unless you have
  plenty.


Memory Problems with JPEGs
--------------------------
  If you are running out of memory then most likely it is
  the 'low' or below 640k memory.  You will have to remove some drivers or
  other items that are using the lower memory.  One way to free up a bit of
  memory (and speed up viewing) in DVPEG for JPEGs is to:
 - under F7, reduce the buffer to 4k (default is 16k)
 - use the 1 pass quantizer or Greyscale
 - turn off the panning (you can still shrink the image as it shows)

Video Problems
--------------
  1) Only 256 color, hi-color (15/16 bit) and true-color (24 bit) video cards
	are supported.  16 color (VGA) is supported as 16 shades of gray only.
  2) CGA, Hercules and anything less than 16 colors is not supported
  3) If your video card is not supported use a VESA TSR or driver.
  4) If you find the vidsetup.exe program hard to use:
  4.1) delete the dvpeg.cfg file, if it was created
  4.2) run DVPEG
  4.3) If you have problems with pictures not showing properly:
   Run VIDSETUP.exe and
   hit enter twice, arrow to video modes which your card does not
   work with; delete them; hit ESC twice and type Y to save the data
     I am sorry but that is about as easy as it gets
  5) If no images appear on the screen then chances are that the at least
	one of the video modes in the list is not supported by the video card
   you have.  Use vidsetup to test the modes and delete the offending
   one from the list.
   Vidsetup.exe does not have a clue which video modes are supported by
   a certain video card and this is the cause of many problems.


To find out about options, hit F1 at any time.

Check the read.me file for detailed information about vidsetup.exe, dvpeg.exe,
dvpeg286.exe

Basically:
 vidsetup.exe  - allows setting of defaults for the viewer (dvpeg) and
	testing of video modes
 dvpeg.exe     - 386/486 viewer
 dvpeg286.exe  - 286 viewer
 dvpeg-re.exe  - 386 JPEG/GIF (only) viewer with reduced features

The JPEG conversion code came from the Independant JPEG Group (more
  info is in the source code file) and a lot of the video drivers came from
  the vgakit41.zip.  Their code was free so this is as well.

P.S.  Many thanks to my beta testers and those who shared their knowledge.
      I would also like to thank Tom Lane and the IJG along with various
      people who have compiled video information (VGAKIT, VGADOC) that is on
      most big sites.

******************************************************************************

Any video card with a VESA driver (TSR or built into the BIOS) should work.
You can get VESA drivers for many video cards from the mfg. of the card or
use a shareware "universal" VESA driver.  One such driver is univbe which
can be found on oak.oakland.edu or wuarchive.wustl.edu in msdos/graphics
as univbe??.zip

Not all cards from a Mfg will support all of these modes.  In most cases you
will need 1 Meg of video ram for the hi resolution modes and some modes (like
the hi_color ones) are recent additions and only supported by the most recent
cards sold.  To test a certain mode on your video card/moniter setup use
vidsetup.exe  Usually if the mode is not supported the video card locks up
and you can't get back to the text screen.  The only solution is to reset
the computer.

Run vidsetup for a complete list of video modes.
Note:  They are not all tested.
Here is a list of some video cards supported:



Diamond SpeedStar 24X, Paradise, WD compatable cards
