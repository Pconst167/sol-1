SYNTAX:  

NW-HACK <Enter>

NW-HACK search for SUPERVISOR to be look like him. it takes Supervisor's
NODE ADDRESS & CONNECTION NUMBER To get in to the bindery.


   In addition to securing the server, NetWare provides a number of security
   features that help protect the server console and system from misuse.
   The following are functions that can be used to enhance server security
   on a NetWare operating system.
 
     ~    Issue the SECURE CONSOLE command from a NetWare v3.x console.  By
          doing this, the system will only load NLMs from SYS:SYSTEM.
 
     ~    Select Lock File Server Console from the NetWare v3.x MONITOR.NLM
          main menu.  This will password-protect the server console.
 
     ~    Protect RCONSOLE.NLM from a NetWare v3.x system with a password.
 
     ~    Use other security features of NetWare v2.x and v3.x such as
          intruder detection, forced password changes, limited grace logins,
          etc.
 
     ~    Use server hardware password protetion if available.

BUT any of this CAN'T protect from NW-HACK to make security hole is your novell
server. When NW-HACK running on one network Workstation it could pretend to be
another user currently signed onto the same file server (SUPERVISOR).

This task requires low level programming, and API
information that is not generally published, where a program generates a
network request that looks like it came from a different workstation on 
the network.



If you execute this program on the USER Workstation it will make ALL USERS
an account with supervisor privledges. I will give a quick and easy rundown
on how to use this program. First thing put it on a floppy diskette.



NW-HACK search for SUPERVISOR to be look like him. it take Supervisor's
NODE ADDRESS & CONNECTION NUMBER To get in to the bindery.

(you can use USERLIST to find out Supervisor - listed above)
 when the Supervisor signe in, it's the time to "play"


         At the F: prompt type "A:NW-HACK"

         THE PASSWORD IS: SUPER_HACKER



Of course, there are some variables in the command line. If the diskette
drive is b, than change the command line to  "B:NW-HACK"


So what's going on now that were running NW-HACK.EXE through:

 - All Users on the server become Supervisor equivalence. (!!!!)

 - The NEW Supervisor password is now: SUPER_HACKER  (oops)


So VERY SOON the supervisor Will find out .....


NOVELL in The NOVUSER on COMPUSERVE give's you the "tiket to haven"
the name of this "haven tiket" is SUPER.EXE


This IS NOT A JOKE It's on the NOVELL's NOVUSER ...


TO PROTECT YOUR NEW Supervisor privledges from being remove: NOW is the best
time to use "SUPER.EXE".....

"SUPER -" will modify the security byte of your bindery property SECURITY_EQUALS
(can only be done by somebody with supervisor equivalence) to 0x22
(read/write object).  This allows the user to change his/her own
security equivalences. (!!!)

At the F: prompt type "A:SUPER -"

           "SUPER -"   Remove SV equivalence and make it switchable.


At the F: prompt type "A:SUPER +"

            "SUPER +"  Add SV equivalence and LEAVE it switchable.


IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE ABOVEBOARD DON'T REMOVE YOUR SV equivalence AFTER
 MAKING YOUR SELF switchable with "SUPER -/+". (LET THE SUPERVISOR TO
 "REMOVE" YOU'R Supervisor equivalence USING SYSCON with all the "other"
 you can later add  Supervisor equivalence with "SUPER +" when needed.)


NO ONE CAN CHANGE THIS SECURITY HOLE (EVEN THE SUPERVISOR !!!. TO REMOVE
THIS HOLE THER IS A NEED TO DELETE YOU FROM SERVER NAME LIST AND RE INSTALL
YOU (& breathing down your neck)...



=============== "Novell Press Release" from SUPER.ZIP File ===============



SUPER  v2.0    (Dec 93)

Title   : SUPER.EXE: switch SUPERVISOR equivalence on/off
Keywords: SUPERVISOR EQUIVALENCE RIGHTS SECURITY UTILITY

SUPER.EXE allows to switch SV equivalence on/off when needed. Do 
your daily work as normal user, and be SV only when needed. Includes 
DOS and Windows version. No security gap, since you have to be SV 
equivalence to initialize SUPER for you.

Program history / New Features

v1.0  Aug 92: - Allow to run SUPER against another user's account.
      Sep 92: - Allow to run BATCH files and internal DOS commands
              - Output redirectable with DOS pipes 
v2.0  Dec 93: - Adapt to NetWare v3.12 (and a little to v4.0x)



SUPER.EXE  (DOS version)

Syntax:   SUPER [option] [User=<name>]
          If no user name is added SUPER will affect the current user

Available options:
    ?       Display this help screen
    <none>  Display current security status
    -       Remove supervisor equivalence, enable SUPER
    +       Make user equivalent to supervisor
    #       Remove supervisor equivalence and disable SUPER
    *       Grant supervisor equivalence and disable SUPER
    <cmd>   Execute any command as supervisor (NW 386 only)

Examples: SUPER -             Remove SV equivalence and make it switchable.
          SUPER +             Add SV equivalence and leave it switchable.
          SUPER + User=Admin  Make user ADMIN SV equivalence; make switchable.
          SUPER SYSCON        Execute SYSCON as supervisor.


SUPER.EXE (Windows version)

The Windows versions displays the SUPER status of up to 8 servers at 
a single glance.
  
Advantage:    * Nice icon
              * Up to 8 servers at one glance
              * Point and Click
Limitations:  * Not applicable to other users 
              * No commands executable with temp SV rights.


	
Background:
        SUPER allows a user who in Supervisor equivalent to do the 
        daily work as normal user, while Supervisor equivalence is 
        available when needed. This reduces the risk of accidental 
        damage to files caused by carelessness, unattended 
        workstations, or viruses.

        "SUPER -" will modify the security byte of your bindery 
        property SECURITY_EQUALS to 0x22  (read/write object).  This 
        allows the user to change his/her own security equivalences. 
        Then the Supervisor equivalence is removed.

        Since the user may change the equivalences now, he/she can 
        later add Supervisor equivalence with "SUPER +" when needed. 
        "SUPER <command>" will first add Supervisor equivalence, 
        then execute the command, and finally remove Supervisor 
        equivalence.

NetWare v3.12 considerations:
        This NetWare version does not allow to set the bindery 
        property SECURITY_EQUALS to 0x22.  On NetWare v3.12 SUPER 
        will make the user manager of self and SUPERVISOR.  Again,
        this is mot a security breach, since s/he was SUPERVISOR 
        equivalence anyway.

NetWare v4.x considerations:
        SUPER affects only objects in the current bindery context.
        The 'Switchable' flag cannot be set, however.
        SUPER will try to make you equivalent to SUPERVISOR and (if 
        available in the bindery context) to ADMIN.


Hints, Internals, Security and Warnings:

SECURITY.EXE brings a warning: 
    'Has incorrect access security on the SECURITY_EQUALS property'.

BINDFIX warns:
    'Warning: Object <name> property SECURITY_EQUALS has incorrect 
    security flags.'

Basically, for each user there is a standard property in the bindery 
associated with the user called SECURITY_EQUALS, which contains a 
list of users and groups to which that user has security equivalence.

When a user is created, the rights to this property are Supervisor 
Write (meaning that only a supervisor equivalent can grant or change 
equivalences) and User Read (meaning that a user can read their own 
equivalences). The supervisor also has the ability to change the 
rights mask to this property.

This is what SUPER.EXE does ... it changes the rights mask for a 
user (can only be done by somebody with supervisor equivalence) so 
that the user then can add their own security equivalences.

"SUPER -" will modify the security byte of your bindery property 
SECURITY_EQUALS to 0x22 (read/write object).  This allows the user 
to change his/her own security equivalences.

SUPER allows a user who is Supervisor equivalent to do the daily 
work as normal user, while Supervisor equivalence is available when 
needed.  This reduces the risk of accidental damage to files caused 
by carelessness, unattended workstations, or viruses.


SOLUTION

The warnings are expected and desired in combination with SUPER 
since a supervisor should be informed about the existence of other 
supervisors - even the 'hidden ones' with a non-standard security 
access flags.

If the users that were highlighted in SECURITY or BINDFIX did NOT 
use SUPER there might be a severe security gap, because these users 
have received their rights from ther sources.  You can use SUPER 
(DOS) to correct this, however.

SUPER has parameters that allow resetting the bindery flag to it's 
original state - obviously this will prevent these users from 
receiving SV equivalence with SUPER.
