    The installation program on this disk was designed to install the     
    program from the A or B drive. Just type INSTALL at the DOS prompt    
    for installation instructions.                                        

    If you downloaded to your hard drive from a BBS or from a CD-ROM disk,
    then the compressed file OVK.EXE is the only file needed. Copy it to
    a directory of its own and run it to decompress the program files. 
    Then type "VAMPIRE" to run the program.                                 

    However, if you copy this program to disk for distribution to your    
    friends and associates, then you should copy all of the files in the  
    archive to the disk you plan to distribute. The distribution files
    will fit on a 360k disk.
