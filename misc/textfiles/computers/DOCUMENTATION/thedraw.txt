       The above license statement does not  apply to  the REGISTERED version
       of TheDraw.   The  registered software of TheSoft Programming Services
       is protected  under United  States Copyright  and Trademark  Laws.  It
       must be treated just like a book with certain exceptions as follows:

       A. TheSoft  Programming  Services  authorizes  the  making of archival
          copies  of  the  registered  software  for  the  sole   purpose  of
          backing-up  your  software  and  protecting  your  investment  from
          possible loss.

       B. The  medium  on  which  the  registered  software  is  recorded  is
          transferred to the customer, but not the title to the software.

       C. The  customer  may  resell  or  distribute unmodified copies of the
          registered  software  provided  the  customer  has  purchased  from
          TheSoft Programming  one copy  of the  registered software for each
          one sold or distributed.  The  provisions of  this software license
          shall also  be applicable  to third parties receiving copies of the
          registered software from the customer.

       D. By saying, "just like a book",  TheSoft Programming  means that the
          registered software  may be used by any number of people and may be
          freely moved from one computer location to another so long as there
          is ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY of it being used at one location while
          being used at another.  Just like a book that cannot be read by two
          different people in two different locations at the same time.

       Once a registered user of TheDraw, you are free to utilize the program
       as often as you wish.  Other than having a clear conscience, there are
       many advantages  to registered.   You can opt to receive in the mail a
       registered  version  of  TheDraw  with  configurable  editor commands,
       enhanced editing  facilities, context sensitive pop-up help, and macro
       keys.  The registered version support  utility routines  (uncrunch and
       display) offer  Bios write  capability and  snow/hash prevention.  You
       are also notified via mail  when  significant  enhancements  have been
       made to  the program.  Once registered, all upgrades are available for
       a $5 upgrade fee plus the original TheDraw diskette (see below).

       There are two ways to register.    The  first  is  by  sending  $15 to
       TheSoft Programming  Services along  with a registration form.  You do
       NOT receive the registered version of  TheDraw for  this registration,
       but  are  notified  of  upgrades.    For  an  additional  $5  plus  $2
       shipping/handling, we send you  the  latest  shareware  and registered
       versions of  TheDraw on  disk along  with documentation  (on disk) and
       utilities. If you want to receive TheDraw on a 3.5 inch diskette (720k
       format), add an additional $3 for each diskette ordered.

       If unsure, you can receive the latest shareware version of TheDraw for
       evaluation by sending a formatted diskette plus $5 for handling.

       Please use the following form or print the included file "MAILER" when
       placing an order.

       -----
       NON U.S.  residents, please  send checks drawn on U.S. funds.  We will
       accept non U.S. currency, but you must include  an additional  $5 (US)
       to cover exchange handling.  Also add $5 overseas shipping/handling.


       UPGRADING TO LATEST THEDRAW
       ______________________________________________________________________

       Users who have registered (and received a diskette) may upgrade to the
       latest version of TheDraw by sending  in their  TheDraw ORIGINAL DISK,
       along with  $5 (service and handling).  Please use the following order
       form when upgrading.  If there  has  been  an  address  change, please
       indicate so on the order form.

       The original  disk must be returned and contain the registered version
       of TheDraw.  The disk  will  be  reformatted  and  the  current Master
       copied  onto  it.    Any  disk  in  poor condition will be replaced by
       TheSoft.  If the serial number label is  missing or  the diskette does
       not  contain  the  registered  version  of TheDraw, the update will be
       refused and the diskette returned unchanged.

       TheDraw v4.00                                                xi       




                              I N T R O D U C T I O N


       TheDraw  is  a  powerful  screen  image generator/editor for color and
       monochrome video users.  What  does  that  mean?    Literally, TheDraw
       makes designing and figuring out a video screen display childs play.

       Its basic  premise is  this: be easy to use.  The most novice computer
       user can make an Ansi text file screen  with TheDraw  in only minutes.
       From that  point on,  you can  explore and  use more of the horsepower
       available in TheDraw.

       Someone is probably saying "it edits screens...  big deal".  This type
       of person has never known the agony of creating a good looking menu or
       display for a program (assuming he/she programs), making a fancy batch
       file intro  screen, or  having to  quickly putting together a computer
       presentation for the boss.  

       The biggest problem facing most people is we  really do  not know what
       will  look  good  until  we  see  it.    Manually editing a screen can
       literally take hours.  With  TheDraw,  you  can  free  form  until you
       really  know  what  is  perfect.    With  the picture in mind, you can
       quickly develop whatever is necessary or instruct TheDraw  to create a
       data file  which can be used.  Instead of hours, making a screen takes
       minutes.

       For the curious, TheDraw  can  transform  your  masterpiece  into data
       files with the following formats:   

             ANSI color text (useful in batch files, BBS's, etc...)
             ASCII text (compatible with word processors and text editors)
             BINARY files (generic, useful in most everything)
             BSAVE (for Basic)
             COM files (actual separate programs executable directly 
                by Dos - Great for batch files and presentations)
             ASSEMBLER (for the die-hard coder)
             TURBO PASCAL (directly compilable source code)
             C (format is for Turbo C specifically)
             OBJECT (Intel format compatible, suitable for linking.  Four
                varieties available for Large/Small generic data model, Turbo
                Pascal v4.0+, and QuickBasic v4.0+)
             THEDRAW (custom storage format for FAST loading and saving)

       TheDraw was long ago originally written as an improvement to  a simple
       program named  AnsiDraw written  by Amrich Enterprises.  Both programs
       provided similar operation, with TheDraw giving  a much  enhanced user
       interface.  






       TheDraw v4.00               Introduction                      1       




       TheDraw is  now vastly  improved over  the abilities  of AnsiDraw, and
       most other screen editors.  It  is compatible  with systems  that have
       250k of free memory available.  Monochrome and Color monitor users are
       supported, and  a  special  keyboard  driver  allows  you  to redefine
       keystrokes that  do not operate properly or are used by other programs
       (registered version).  If  you  have  an  EGA  or  VGA  video display,
       TheDraw permits editing 43 or 50 line screens respectfully.

       Another  feature  TheDraw  fully  supports  is  ANIMATION.   With this
       facility you can develop quick and dirty presentations, or simply make
       a generic screen appear with pizzazz.  You can either let TheDraw make
       an animation sequence from  a static  image, or  one can  be made from
       scratch; thus  letting you  fully control the appearance of your work.
       TheDraw gives you a maximum of  16000 separate  animation "entries" to
       handle the  most complex job.  The final result can be saved either as
       an ANSI file (Ansi Animation) or TheDraw format file.  See the section
       entitled "The Animation System" for more information.

       To get started using TheDraw right away, refer to the section entitled
       "Starting TheDraw".   This  section describes  how to  install and run
       TheDraw.

       Throughout  this  documentation  you  may  run  across  the occasional
       enigmatic word  that  needs  explaining.      The  following  are some
       examples you might come across:

             enigmatic      - mysterious or cryptic

             [ENTER] or C/R - This represents the return key on the keyboard.
                              If you see this in the text, press the Enter
                              key; do not type the actual letters.

             ESC or [ESC]   - Means to press the ESC key on the keyboard.

             [letter]       - Means to press the actual key marked 'letter'
                              on your keyboard.  ie: [L] means to press the
                              'L' key.

             Alt-[letter]   - Alt- is always followed by another character. 
                              Together, this symbol means to first press and
                              hold down the ALT key on the keyboard then type
                              the letter key following it.  ie: Alt-A means
                              hold down ALT then press 'A'.

             Ctrl-[letter]  - This is executed the same as the ALT key.
              or ^[letter]    Press and hold down the CTRL then hit the
                              letter following.  ie:  CTRL-A and ^A mean the
                              same thing - hold CTRL then press 'A'.

             [LEFT] [RIGHT] - Means to press the corresponding keypad arrow
             [UP] [DOWN]      key on your keyboard.  Similar to the [letter]
                              example shown above.  ie: [UP] means to press
                              then up arrow key.

                       S Y S T E M   R E Q U I R E M E N T S


       TheDraw requires an IBM PC/XT/AT or close compatible running MsDos 2.0
       or higher.   In  addition,  a  monochrome  adapter  or  color graphics
       display  adapter  (CGA,  EGA,  or  VGA)  plus monitor is needed to run
       properly.

       In a minimum configuration, 250 kilobytes of free memory are required.
       The  maximum  memory  usage  is  410k  of memory (8 page layers, 16000
       animation entries).   TheDraw  will  always  attempt  to  allocate all
       available memory up to the limits specified via the Setup utility.



       MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENTS
       ______________________________________________________________________

       TheDraw  can  be  used  under  multitasking  or windowing environments
       provided the full video  screen  is  allocated  to  it.    The program
       directly  accesses  video  memory  and  the keyboard hardware for some
       functions.  TheDraw does not use any high  resolution graphics  in its
       operation.

       TheDraw  is  known  to  operate  under  Double  Dos  except  for minor
       problems.  Double Dos  disables  certain  keyboard  sequences (notably
       Ctrl-PrtSc).   For this  situation, people with the registered version
       of TheDraw can use the Setup utility to redefine the function of Ctrl-
       Prtsc to another key.

       TheDraw operates  under Microsoft Windows and Desqview provided memory
       and video requirements (as mentioned above) are taken care of.


       Note:    It is easy to cause problems with window  environments if the
                user  wishes.    Working  in  another  window  while  TheDraw
                attempts to refresh its  screen  will  result  in information
                being overwritten.  Be warned.

       Setting up  TheDraw to  operate on your computer is not a great chore.
       Refer to the section below that  applies  to  you.    If  you received
       TheDraw  on  diskette,  it  is  suggested  you  backup the disk before
       proceeding.  It  never  hurts  to  play  things  safe.    On diskettes
       obtained from  TheSoft a  batch file called INSTALL.BAT is included to
       simplify the initial setup (note:  INSTALL.BAT  is  not  included with
       the shareware distributed version of TheDraw).



       FLOPPY DISK INSTALLATION
       ______________________________________________________________________

       If you obtained a diskette from TheSoft, you are almost set to go.  
       You will  want to copy all the files onto the "work" diskette you will
       be using frequently.  To reduce space requirements, the setup utility,
       documentation and  demo files  are compacted.   Use  the INSTALL batch
       file to expand these files onto another diskette.  ie:

                             A:INSTALL FLOPPY <enter>

       Simply follow the online instructions presented.   Once  done, proceed
       to the section "The Setup Utility".



       HARD DISK INSTALLATION
       ______________________________________________________________________

       Create a  sub-directory of  your choice to place TheDraw and files in.
       Next, copy all files to the sub-directory.  Example commands are:

             MKDIR \THEDRAW   Create  a  sub-directory  THEDRAW  in  the root
                              directory of your hard drive.

             CHDIR \THEDRAW   Put Dos into the THEDRAW sub-directory.

             COPY A:*.*       Copy all  files from diskette in drive A to the
                              sub-directory.

       Details of the above commands will not be covered here.   Please refer
       to your  Dos manual  if you  have questions.  On the diskette obtained
       from TheSoft, there is a batch  file to  simplify this  process.  With
       the diskette in drive A, type:

                               A:INSTALL HD <enter>

       This will do all of the above for you automatically.

       MAKE IT DO SOMETHING!
       ______________________________________________________________________

       By this  point you  may be eager to start playing with TheDraw; by all
       means do so.   Use of  the Setup  utility is  not absolutely necessary
       unless TheDraw does not appear to run properly.  To run TheDraw simply
       type from the Dos prompt:

                                  THEDRAW [ENTER]

       People with the registered version type:

                                 THEDRAWR [ENTER]

       After a few seconds, TheDraw will start running and display  its title
       screen.   Press a  key, and  TheDraw is ready.   Quickly, two commands
       you should be familiar with are:

                            ALT-S  Save Screen to Disk
                            ALT-X  Exit TheDraw       

       The former will save your efforts to disk.   The latter will allow you
       to exit TheDraw back to Dos.  Have fun!





       THE DEMO FILES
       ______________________________________________________________________

       TheDraw comes  with two  demonstration files  to help show some of its
       capabilities; SHUTTLE2.ANS and DEMO.TD.      SHUTTLE2.ANS  is a simple
       animation example which you can view from dos by entering:

                             TYPE SHUTTLE2.ANS [Enter]
         
       Note: You must  have the  ANSI.SYS driver installed in your CONFIG.SYS
             file for this to appear  properly.    See  APPENDIX  A  for more
             details on  the CONFIG.SYS  file.   If you do not have ANSI.SYS,
             THEPP (provided with registered version of TheDraw) can  be used
             alternatively (ie: THEPP SHUTTLE2.ANS [Enter]).


       The  second  demo  file,  DEMO.TD,  demonstrates  the block and sprite
       editing features of TheDraw.  To  use  it,  run  TheDraw  as described

       MOVING TO THEDRAW VERSION THREE, FOUR AND BEYOND
       ______________________________________________________________________

       Users of TheDraw versions 2.0, 2.1, or 2.2 will be able to start using
       version 4.0  right away.   The only things the user should be aware of
       are the revised ALT-E  command,  and  the  block  copy/move "exchange"
       command.   To flip  page layers,  the wanted  layer must be specified.
       This differs from the older versions  which merely  toggle between the
       available pages.

       There are  many new additions to TheDraw v4.00.  Some will be apparent
       (such as ability to edit EGA/VGA 43/50 line  screens); some  will not.
       The following is a list of new features added: 

          o  EGA and  VGA screen  support.  TheDraw now permits editing 43/50
             line screens.

          o  Supersized edit  buffer,  up  to  160  characters  by  50 lines,
             available regardless of video display mode.  Autoscrolling makes
             maneuvering a breeze.  User can select any combination of 80/160
             character widths and 25/43/50 lines for the buffer.

          o  Built  in  setup  screen  for adjusting those frequently changed
             default settings.

          o  Mouse aided line drawing.  Pressing and holding the middle mouse
             button  (or  both  buttons  for  a  two-button mouse), will make
             TheDraw generate line/boxes easily.

          o  Several  new  animation  scanners   including:  Doors,  Diamond,
             Circle, Clock, Checkerboard, and WiggleOut.  Plus the ability to
             reverse any given animation scan (ie: instead of  left to right,
             the scan goes right to left).

          o  User  defined  Ansi  control  sequences  may  be entered into an
             animation sequence.

          o  ANY file format (except TheDraw .TD  files) may  be added  to an
             animation  sequence.    For  non-Ansi/Ascii  files, TheDraw will
             prompt to an animation scanner to use.

          o  Two new varieties of COM files.   TheDraw  will try  crunching a
             COM  file.    If  this  does  not succeed in reducing the screen
             size, a second COM  type  specifically  for  screen-width images
             might be  used.  The latter produces 80 by 25 screens under 4096
             bytes, reducing wasted disk space due to cluster allocation.

          o  Backup files can optionally be generated.

          o  TheDraw optionally  can  be  made  to  prompt  on  exit  to save
             modified screens.

          o  Block or  Global Character/Color Replace.  Choose a character or
             target color combination,  position  the  cursor  upon  it, then
             select a replacement.  It is that simple.

          o  Ability to  insert/delete COLUMNS using the ALT-left/right arrow
             key combinations.


       Plus much more!

       This  section  describes  how  to  customize  TheDraw and install your
       customizations in the THEDRAW.EXE or THEDRAWR.EXE (registered version)
       files. 


       WHY SETUP?
       ______________________________________________________________________
        
       Setup  is  the  TheDraw  installation  program;  used to customize the
       TheDraw program (EXE) file.  With this utility you can  specify screen
       modes, change  edit colors  and various  other defaults.  Setup allows
       you to change the TheDraw environment in which  you operate.   It also
       directly modifies  various values  within your  copy of THEDRAW.EXE or
       THEDRAWR.EXE.

       Via Setup you can do the following:

          o  Setup the default video display mode

          o  Change screen colors

          o  Resize TheDraw's usage of available memory

          o  Change save screen default parameters.

          o  Specify initial default filespec wildcards.


       In the registered version of TheDraw, the Setup utility can also:

          o  Customize or "remap" the editor command keys and mouse buttons.

          o  Setup a path to the directory where help files are stored.


       TheDraw comes ready to run; there is no mandatory installation.  After
       setting up as specified in GET RUNNING, you can use TheDraw.

       However, you  will need  to run  Setup if  you want  to do  any of the
       following:

          o  Change TheDraw default colors.

          o  Force a display mode or "snow" checking

          o  Customize the editor commands to preferred sequences.

          o  Adjust memory usage to better suit your needs.

       WINDOWS AND SELECTING OPTIONS
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The setup utility operates  in  a  windowing  user  environment.   You
       select commands by either pressing the highlighted capital letter of a
       given option, or using  the Up  and Down  arrow keys  to move  to your
       selection and then pressing [ENTER].  

       For instance,  from the  main Setup  installation menu  you can select
       Editor configuration (R),  Keyboard  customize,  Screen  mode, Colors,
       Help and overlay file path (R), Memory usage, Defaults, or Quit/Save.

       (R) Available while editing the registered version only.


       SAVING AND ABORTING CHANGES
       ______________________________________________________________________

       In general,  pressing [ENTER]  will save  any changes.  Pressing [ESC]
       (as many times as needed) will abort a function and return you  from a
       submenu to  the main  installation menu.  Where this convention is not
       followed, instructions are displayed on screen for you.


       RUNNING SETUP
       ______________________________________________________________________

       To get started, type SETUP  [ENTER]  at  the  DOS  prompt.    Once the
       utility runs,  you will  be prompted for the filename to modify.  This
       allows you to have several different  customized copies  of TheDraw on
       your  system.    These  various  copies  of  THEDRAW.EXE can each have
       different executable program names.  This allows you  to customize for
       various  editor  command-keys,  menu  colors,  etc...  if  you  are so
       inclined.  The registered program version is called THEDRAWR.EXE. 

       After selecting a file  to  edit,  SETUP  determines  what  version of
       TheDraw is  being updated (shareware or registered).  It then proceeds
       to the main menu.

       RUNNING SETUP: MAIN MENU
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The main  menu presents  several options.   Each  item on  the menu is
       described below:


       EDITOR CONFIGURATION

          The  editor  in  TheDraw  provides  many features, including cursor
          control, color changing, various  text  operations,  etc...   These
          editing commands are assigned to certain keys, as described in this
          documentation.   This  option  allows  you  to  change  the default
          assignments for each function.

          When you  select Editor  Configuration from  SETUP's main menu, the
          editor installation screen appears.   Three  columns of information
          will be immediately notable:

             o  The  first  (left-most)  column  describes  each configurable
                function available in the editor.

             o  The second column lists Primary keystrokes.   These  keys are
                the defaults by which TheDraw normally operates.

             o  The  third  column  lists  Secondary  keystrokes.   These are
                optional alternates keystrokes  you  may  press  to  invoke a
                given editor action.  These keystrokes always take precedence
                over the primary keystrokes described above.

          Along the bottom of the screen is a list of the keys used to select
          and modify entries.

             Key              Action
             _______________________________________________________________

             Up and Down      Selects the editor command you wish to change.
             arrow keys

             PgUp/PgDn        Scrolls up/down one full screen page.

             [ENTER]          Enters the secondary keystroke modify mode.

             R                Restore  all  editor  commands  to the original
                              default values.

             [ESC]            Returns to the main SETUP options menu.

          After pressing [ENTER] to modify a  command, the  current secondary
          definition disappears.   You  can then type in your new definition.
          Anything may  be used  for redefining  a key  except Numbers (0-9),
          Letters (A-Z,a-z),  Enter, Esc,  and Backspace.   A maximum of four
          keystrokes  for  any  given  editor  command  is  allowed; however,
          certain  key  combinations  are  equal  to  two  keystrokes.  These
          include ALT-(key),  cursor movement  keys (up,  PgDn, Home, etc...)
          and any keystroke involving a function key (F1, CTRL-F4, etc...).

          Upon pressing ESC, if anything has been changed you are prompted to
          save the changes.  Next,  if  there  are  any  duplicate keystrokes
          SETUP will  point out  the first occurrence so you can clear up the
          problem (marked with an asterisk).


       KEYBOARD CUSTOMIZE

          The true IBM-PC and certain clones have a  Bios omission preventing
          the  Ctrl-Up,  Ctrl-Down,  Alt-Left, and Alt-Right key combinations
          from working properly.  TheDraw gets around this by using  a custom
          keyboard driver.  The factory defaults from TheSoft will work for a
          good majority of all computers.  However, if  you have difficulties
          try this configuration.

          SETUP examines  the keyboard  hardware to see what happens when any
          of the above are pressed.  Upon selecting  this option,  the screen
          clears and  prompts if you wish to continue.  Next you are asked to
          press Ctrl-Up, Ctrl-Down, Alt-Left, Alt-Right in that order.  SETUP
          will display scan codes returned by your keyboard for those keys.  

          Next you  can experiment  to see  that everything is indeed working
          properly.  Press Ctrl-Up/Down,  Alt-Left/Right until  satisfied you
          programmed the correct keys.  When ready press [ENTER] to return to
          the main menu.

          Note: 
             A very few computers  react  badly  to  this  driver.    If your
             computer does  not operate as expected when you run TheDraw, run
             the setup utility from Dos as follows:

                                  SETUP * [Enter]

             Setup will display the current setting  of the  driver.  Respond
             Yes or  No if the setting is correct.  If after deactivating the
             driver your computer still locks, please contact TheSoft.

       SCREEN MODE

          Normally, THEDRAW will automatically  determine  the  correct video
          mode of  your computer.   You should only need to change the Screen
          mode option if:

             o  you think TheDraw is incorrectly detecting your hardware.

             o  you have a Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) that does not produce
                the "snow" or hashing effect.

             o  You have an EGA or VGA video card and wish to always start in
                43/50 line edit mode.

             o  your computer has a composite video screen, appearing  like a
                CGA but  with only  one color.   In  this case,  you want the
                Black and White screen option.

          Upon pressing S to select this  option, a  pop-up menu  will appear
          with the available options.  These are fairly apparent:


          DEFAULT

             TheDraw will operate in the mode active when first run.


          BLACK AND WHITE

             TheDraw  will  use  composite  black and white mode (80 column),
             regardless of the active mode  when  first  run.    The original
             video mode will be selected when you exit TheDraw.


          COLOR

             TheDraw will use color mode (80 column), regardless of what mode
             active when first run.  The original video mode will be selected
             when you exit TheDraw.


          EGA/VGA

             TheDraw  will  use  color  mode  (80  column)  and  43/50 lines,
             regardless of what mode was  active  initially.    Initial video
             mode is restored upon exit from TheDraw.

          MONOCHROME

             TheDraw  uses  monochrome  video  mode, and switches back to the
             previous mode upon exiting.

          After selecting one of the first three options above (Default, B&W,
          or Color),  SETUP checks  the screen  for snow.  If you see snow or
          hashing, respond Yes to the prompt that appears.



       COLOR CONFIGURATION

          TheDraw holds three complete  sets of  configurable colors.   Which
          color  set  is  used  depends  on the initial screen mode specified
          above.  The sets  are for  Color, Black  and White,  and Monochrome
          screen users.  A pop-up window prompts for which set to edit.

          After selecting  a color  set, another  pop-up prompts for the item
          type to configure.  Options are the Edit Screen, Main Help Display,
          Directory  (Load/View)  Screen,  Pop-up  help,  and  Pull-Down menu
          display.

          Next,  a  menu  of  configurable  items  under  that  type appears.
          Selecting one  displays a  view port and list of available colors. 
          The view port shows an example of the  screen item  you chose.   It
          also reflects any changes in colors as you scroll through the color
          palette.

          Use the arrows keys to select  a  color  to  your  liking  from the
          palette.   Watch the  view port  to see  how the item looks in that
          color.  Press [ENTER] or [ESC] to save your choice.

          Now repeat this procedure for every screen color  item you  want to
          customize.   When done,  press [ESC]  until you  return to the main
          SETUP menu.



       FILES DIRECTORY

          The Files  Directory is  used by  TheDraw to  find its  files.  The
          shareware version looks for the pick list file (THEDRAW.PCK) there.
          The registered version of TheDraw looks for its help and  macro key
          files there in addition.

          The current  setting is  displayed for  you.   To change it, simply
          type in the new directory.  Enter a period (.) by itself to use the
          current directory  of Dos  when TheDraw  is loaded.   Press [ENTER]
          without entry to leave unchanged.

       MEMORY USAGE

          TheDraw always tries to allocate all available memory  up to limits
          specified by this SETUP option.  When fully configured, TheDraw can
          use as much as 410k of  memory.    Memory  is  allocated  first for
          screen page layers and then for the animation system.

          If you  have limited  memory, there might not be enough space for 8
          page layers and 16000 animation entries (maximum usage).  There may
          however  be  enough  space  for  4  page  layers and 5000 animation
          entries, or just one layer, or anything in between.

          This  is  when  you  may  wish  to  override  the  automatic memory
          allocation.   To make  TheDraw operate  as in earlier versions, you
          would want just 2 page layers  and  5000  entries.    Feel  free to
          experiment.  Keep in mind that TheDraw will scale down all settings
          when loaded if there is insufficient memory.

          Upon selecting this option the current  settings are  displayed for
          you.   The amount  of memory occupied by screen page layers and the
          animation system is also  indicated.   If you  wish to  change them
          answer Yes  to the prompt.  You can then enter new values for both.



       DEFAULTS

          TheDraw has certain default  values  used  throughout  the program.
          Some of these are:

             o  Initial edit colors
             o  Default file extensions
             o  Default file save parameters
             o  Sticky directory wildcards
             o  Initial work file directory
             etc...

          Selecting Defaults  from the main setup menu displays a screen with
          several fields.  Use the up and down arrow keys to select the field
          you wish  to change.   PgUp/PgDn switches between the three screens
          of options.  To  change a  value follow  the on  screen directions.
          Pressing "R"  at any  time restores  all "factory" defaults.  Press
          [ESC] when satisfied with your changes.

       QUIT/SAVE

          Once all changes are completed, select Quit/save at  the main SETUP
          menu.  The message:

                                Save Changes? (Y/N)

          appears along  the bottom  line of  the screen.  Reply Yes, and all
          the changes you have made will  be saved  into TheDraw.   Reply No,
          and all  your changes  are ignored.  After either reply, you return
          to the operating system (Dos).

          If you ever decide to reset TheDraw completely to factory defaults,
          simply copy  the EXE  program file from your original disk (you did
          make one right?) onto your work disk.  If you just want  the editor
          commands restored, select the R command under Editor Configuration.

       COMMAND LINE FILESPECS
       ______________________________________________________________________

       For convenience,  TheDraw allows  you to  specify a  filespec from Dos
       when first running the program.  ie:

                                  THEDRAW DEMO.TD

       Only one  file may  be specified  this way.  All files are loaded onto
       page layer one (except for  THEDRAW  format  files  which  may contain
       multiple layers).



       THE STATUS LINE
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The status  line of  TheDraw shows various information about the state
       of the program.  Each structure in the status line is described below:

          (xx,xx)        Displays the current cursor position.

          Color          Indicates the current drawing color.   This color is
                         used for any new characters placed onto the screen.

          Text,          The word displayed indicates if TheDraw is in normal
          Attr, or       text, color draw mode, or line draw mode.  In color
          Draw           draw mode,  moving the  cursor changes characters to
                         the current colors.      In  Draw  mode,  moving the
                         cursor with the arrow keys draws a line in the moved
                         direction.

          Ins            Appears when TheDraw is  in  Insert  keystroke mode.
                         When on, typing a character shifts everything to the
                         right to make room for the new character.

          Page:x or      Indicates the current screen page edit layer.  In
          Anim:x         animation mode (see The  Animation  System  for more
                         details), the  word Anim appears.  In addition, this
                         structure indicates when TheDraw  is in  sprite edit
                         mode  (see  ALT-E).    In sprite mode, the structure
                         appears in capital letters.  ie: PAGE or ANIM.  

          Set:xx         Number of the current  function key  set.   This set
                         appears immediately after this indicator.


       Note: The symbol "x" or "xx" indicates a number of some value.

       HELP!!!
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The shareware  version of  TheDraw contains three outline help screens
       available from command mode (no sub-functions being used)  by pressing
       ALT-H.  These outline screens display brief notes about all operations
       available in the program.

       The registered version of TheDraw supports context sensitive help.  In
       other  words,  pressing  ALT-H  anywhere  in the program will bring up
       specific information on that area of TheDraw.  This can be very useful
       during the learning stage or for rarely used functions.



       CURSOR CONTROL
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The cursor may be moved by using the following keys:

                Key           Action
                _____________________________________________________

                Up Arrow      Up one line
                Down Arrow    Down one line
                Left Arrow    Left one position
                Right Arrow   Right one position
                Home          First column of current line
                End           Last column of current line
                PgUp          First line in current column
                PgDn          Last line in current column
                Ctrl-Home     First Character of current line
                Ctrl-End      Last Character of current line (plus 1)
                Ctrl-PgUp     Upper-left position of screen
                Ctrl-PgDn     Lower-right position of screen
                Tab           Next set Tab position (see Alt-T)
                Shift-Tab     Previous set Tab position (see Alt-T)
                Enter         First column of following line
                _____________________________________________________


       Naturally, if  you attempt  to move  past the  screen border no action
       will be taken.  If  no  tab  position  follows  the  current location,
       pressing [TAB] will return you to column one of the current line.

       MOUSE CONTROL
       ______________________________________________________________________

       TheDraw  fully  supports  the  use  of a Microsoft Mouse or compatible
       device.  Pull down  menus  and  other  facilities  are  available (see
       section PULL  DOWN MENU  SYSTEM).   You may  use either a two or three
       button mouse with TheDraw.  

       The mouse operates differently depending on where you  are in TheDraw.
       At command mode (no sub-functions in use) the mouse functions are:

             MOVEMENT:        Moves cursor.
             LEFT BUTTON:     Marks a block.
             MIDDLE BUTTON:   Toggles line drawing mode
             RIGHT BUTTON:    Activates pull down menu system.


       In any sub-function:

             MOVEMENT:        Moves  cursor/block/screen/etc...   If movement
                              is allowed, you can use the mouse.
             LEFT BUTTON:     Equivalent to pressing [ENTER].
             MIDDLE BUTTON:   Unused.
             RIGHT BUTTON:    Displays a small window  with all  current menu
                              options.


       Someone comfortable  with a  mouse will  find TheDraw easy to get used
       to.  The mouse is usable everywhere in the program.  If  no particular
       mouse indicator  appears, the RIGHT mouse button will generally pop up
       a window with available  options.   Simply click  the RIGHT  button on
       the wanted option to select it.

       Users  without  a  mouse  will  find TheDraw operates normally without
       change.

       Note: A Microsoft  compatible  mouse  driver  (MSMOUSE.SYS  or similar
             program)  must  be  installed  into  your CONFIG.SYS file before
             TheDraw  will  recognize  the  device.    See  APPENDIX   A  for
             information  on  configuring  Config.Sys.    Once  the driver is
             installed, TheDraw auto-detects the presence of the mouse.

       TheDraw can be fully  controlled  via  pull  down  menus.    The menus
       greatly simplify  learning TheDraw by conveniently showing all related
       commands.

       The pull down menus are activated from command  mode using  one of two
       ways.   Pressing either  the [ESC]  key on  the keyboard or if using a
       mouse the RIGHT-most button.   The  following options  bar will appear
       across the top of the screen:

       Each  heading  is  described  briefly  below.    For  full  functional
       descriptions, please  refer to  the appropriate  section under THEDRAW
       KEYBOARD COMMANDS.


       The FILES Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       The  Files  pull-down  menu  offers  assorted  options  for loading or
       viewing existing files, deleting  old  files,  and  saving  the screen
       image currently  being edited.   When you load a file, it is read into
       the screen edit area.  When done with a file, you can  save it  to any
       directory  or  file  name.    In addition, from this pull-down you can
       change to another directory, temporarily go  to a  Dos Shell,  or exit
       TheDraw completely.
                                  
                                   Load       
                                   View       
                                   Delete     
                                   Change Dir 
                                   Save       
                                   Quit       
                                  

       LOAD - Load a File (ALT-L)

          Displays a  list of files under the current directory.  You can use
          DOS-style wildcard masks for  a listing  of specific  wanted files.
          Simply type  in the  name of the file to load or use the arrow keys
          to move the selector bar and press [ENTER].  Activate the pick list
          by pressing the TAB key or the RIGHT-most mouse button.

       VIEW - View a File (ALT-V)

          Similar  to  LOAD,  except  the  image  is loaded only temporarily.
          Pressing [ENTER] returns to command mode.


       DELETE - Delete a File (ALT-K)

          Allows files  to  be  deleted  from  within  TheDraw.    The screen
          operates  identically  to  the  LOAD  option above.  The difference
          being TheDraw will attempt to delete any file you select.


       CHANGE DIR - Change Working Directory (ALT-O)

          Displays all subdirectories in the current  directory.   Select the
          wanted  directory  by  typing  it  in  or  using the arrow keys and
          pressing [ENTER].  To change  to  another  drive,  simply  type the
          wanted drive followed by a colon.  ie: "C:"


       SAVE - Save Current Screen to a File (ALT-S)

          Saves current screen image to one of a variety of file formats.


       QUIT - Quit/Shell from TheDraw (ALT-X)

          Allows you  to either  exit TheDraw completely or leave the program
          just temporarily.  In both cases, you end up at the Dos prompt.

          To return to TheDraw from a Dos Shell, type EXIT.   This  is useful
          when you want to run a DOS command without quitting TheDraw.  



       The GLOBAL Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       The global  menu offers  options that  affect the  entire edit screen.
       These options include  moving  and  copying  the  screen,  plus global
       screen fills and text operations.

                                     
                                      Copy 
                                      Move 
                                      Fill 
                                      Text

          Allows the rotating of the screen  around  its  borders.    Use the
          arrow keys or the mouse.  Press [ENTER] or the LEFT mouse button to
          save at the new location.


       FILL - Global Fill Screen (ALT-G,Fill)

          Fills the entire screen based  on  a  specified  sub-command.   The
          available  options  allow  just  the  color  attributes,  just  the
          characters, or both to be changed at once.


       TEXT - Global Text Operations (ALT-G,Text)

          Performs various screen  text  operations.    Available sub-options

          symbols.  From this you can  select which  character set  you would
          like to work with.  Use the arrow keys or the mouse.  Press [ENTER]
          to save your choice.

       TAB SETUP - Adjust TheDraw Tab Stops (ALT-T)

          This command permits the setting of  tabs in  the editor (positions
          where the  [TAB] key  stops).  Initially the positions are at every
          tenth column.   Sub-commands  are available  for setting, clearing,
          and resetting tabs.


       RULER - On-Screen Ruler (ALT-N)

          Places a  pair of lines on the screen which intersect at the cursor
          position.   Move the ruler using arrows or  the mouse.   [ENTER] or
          LEFT mouse  button saves  the new cursor position.  This command is
          useful for aligning items of the screen.  The ruler can be  held on
          the screen by selecting the [S]ticky option.  


       PAINT/FILL - Enclosed Area Painter (ALT-P)

          Lets you  fill an enclosed area easily with characters and/or color
          attributes.  An area is defined  as  any  shape  formed  using line
          characters  (from  function  key  sets  1-4).  To use this command,
          position the cursor inside  the target  area before  activating the
          pull down menus.


       SETUP OPTIONS - Default Setup Configuration (no separate key sequence)

          Provides access  to many  of the  configurable defaults while using
          TheDraw.  The following options may be changed:

          WORKSHEET WIDTH
             Choose how wide the  edit buffer  should be.   Either  80 or 160
             characters.

          WORKSHEET DEPTH
             Choose how deep the edit buffer should be.  Can be 25, 43, or 50
             lines.  Note the worksheet depth cannot be  less than  the video
             mode in  use.   For example,  if using  43 line EGA editing, the
             worksheet depth cannot be less than 43 lines.

          VIDEO SCREEN MODE
             Choose one of the  following  video  edit  modes:    Standard 80
             character  by  25  lines  (80x25),  80x43 (if using EGA card) or
             80x50 (if using VGA card).

          MAINTAIN FILE DESCRIPTOR LISTING WILDCARD
             Tells TheDraw to maintain  wildcards specified  in the directory
             listing  available  during  loading  (or deleting).  For example
             entering "*.BIN" to  see  all  binary  files  would  normally be
             forgotten, unless this option was turned on.

          DEFAULT SAVE SCREEN FORMAT
             Default file  format TheDraw  should select  when saving a file.
             Upon hitting ALT-S, you are present with many choices.  Pressing
             [ENTER] selects  the default  save screen  format.   If you find
             yourself using a specific  format  often,  changing  the default
             might prove a convenience.

          DEFAULT LOAD SCREEN FORMAT
             Similar  to  the  above,  but  used  during loading.  If you are
             working with a given file type  regularly, changing  the default
             load format  will save  you from typing the file extension.  For
             example if set to Binary, "DEMO"  becomes "DEMO.BIN"  instead of
             "DEMO.ANS".

          CREATE BACKUP FILES
             Instructs TheDraw  to generate  backup files  when saving.  If a
             file already exists, TheDraw  will  change  the  existing file's
             extension to .BAK, then continue the save.

          SAVING FILENAME PICK LIST ON EXIT TO DOS
             Controls the  saving of  the filename pick list to disk on exit.
             When off, any accumulated filenames will be lost upon exit.

          ASK TO SAVE CHANGES BEFORE EXITING
             TheDraw can be made to prompt  before allowing  exit to  Dos, if
             changes were made to the current page or any page.

          USE ALT-KEY HELP WINDOW
             Holding  down  the  ALT  key  for about three seconds displays a
             brief pop-up of available commands.  The feature may be disabled
             by toggling this option.

          BLANK SCREEN AFTER HOW MANY MINUTES
             TheDraw will  blank the screen by writing blanks if no action is
             taken for a specified time.  The time delay can be set from 1 to
             255 minutes, or turned off completely.

          DISK SWAP FILE PATHNAME
             Used when  doing a Dos Shell (see ALT-X,S).  TheDraw attempts to
             write all its data  to expanded  memory or  a disk  swap file to
             provide more  room during  the shell.   If insufficient expanded
             memory (EMM or EMS) is available, the disk swap file  is used at
             the  specified  path.    Leaving  this option blank will prevent
             TheDraw from using a swap file. 

          DEFAULT FILENAME EXTENSIONS
             The default filename extensions TheDraw uses when saving a file.
             Change  to  your  preference.    For instance, if saving an Ansi
             file, TheDraw will change "DEMO" into "DEMO.ANS".





       TheDraw v4.00           Pull Down Menu System                25       



          DEFAULT ASM,PASCAL,C SAVE FORMAT
             Controls if TheDraw defaults to Normal,  Ascii, or  Crunching of
             screen data.  See ALT-S for more information.

          FILTER OUT SOLID SPACES ON ANSI/ASCII/ASM/PASCAL/C FILES
             Occasionally   solid   spaces   (entered  with  Shift-Space  key
             combination) cause prompts with  other  programs.    This filter
             will  convert  all  solid  spaces  to  normal spaces in the data
             written to disk (for Ansi, Ascii, Asm, Pascal, and C formats).

          FORCE CR/LF ON END OF LINES OF ASCII THAT ARE SCREEN WIDTH
             TheDraw is faced with a dilemma  when saving  Ascii files.   The
             Dos TYPE command automatically wraps the cursor down a line when
             screen width text (80 characters) is printed.   TheDraw normally
             handles this  by not  writing a carriage return sequence (CR/LF)
             for those lines, as it is not needed.  However,  reading such an
             Ascii file  into other  programs can  cause problems.  Therefore
             this option forces TheDraw to always write the  CR/LF regardless
             of anything.  A simple, yet effective, solution.

          RESET COLORS TO WHITE ON END OF ANSI FILES
             Controls if TheDraw resets the Ansi colors to white after all is
             said and done.  Generally of use in  animation files,  where the
             last character printed is flashing magenta on a green background
             (or some even worse color combination).

          DEFAULT ANSI VIDEO PREPARATION
             Choose if by default TheDraw does  nothing, homes  the cursor to
             the  upper  left  screen  corder,  or  clears  the screen before
             displaying an Ansi file.

          DEFAULT ANSI SLOW DOWN FACTOR
             Choose how many delay elements TheDraw  inserts by  default into
             an  Ansi  file.    Normally  used  on  faster  machines  to make
             animation more appealing (ie: visible).

          MAXIMUM ANSI LINE LENGTH
             Controls the maximum line length TheDraw  will permit  a line of
             Ansi  to  become.    Some  programs have line length limitations
             (such as bulletin board systems).  Since TheDraw can conceivable
             generate lines  thousands of characters long, this option allows
             you to compensate.   The  setting  can  be  between  32  and 255
             characters, or set to Unlimited if no conflicts exist.

       The SCREEN Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Use items  in the  Screen menu  to erase  a page  layer or select some
       other page.  Other options allow you to insert, delete, or restore the
       contents of individual lines.            
                                                
                                 
                                  Clear Page   
                                  Select Page         
                                  Insert Line         
                                  Delete Line         
                                  Restore Line        
                                         
                                                
       CLEAR PAGE - Clear the Current or All Page Layers (ALT-C)

          Erases the  image in  the current  page.  You may also opt to erase
          all page layers in  one fell  swoop for  a completely  clean slate.
          You will  be prompted  to save  the current  screen if changes have
          been made.


       SELECT PAGE - Choose a New Page to Work On (ALT-E)

          TheDraw prompts for the page layer  you  wish  to  edit.    Enter a
          number  between  one  (1)  and  the number of available pages.  The
          mouse can be used for selection by pressing the RIGHT button.


       INSERT LINE (ALT-I)

          Inserts a blank horizontal screen line at the position of  the edit
          cursor.  This command is not reversible so use it carefully.


       DELETE LINE (ALT-Y)

          Similar to Insert, but deletes the line rather than inserts one.


       RESTORE LINE - Recover from Unwanted Changes on the Screen (ALT-R)

          Brings  back  the  previous  copy  of the horizontal line currently
          being worked on.  Please note  that  once  you  leave  a  line, all
          changes are permanent.

       The ANIMATION Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Provides  various  facilities  for  working with the TheDraw animation
       system.  Options  allow  the  display  and  editing  of  the animation
       sequence.    The  registered  version  of  TheDraw  adds  Limiting and
       animation markers (as shown below). 

                               
                                Screen Redraw    
                                Change Character

                                Include Files    
                                Limiting         
                                marKer           
                                Movement Storage      
                                Rescan Animation 
                                Pause Animation  
                               

       SCREEN REDRAW - Display the Entire Animation Sequence (ALT-Q)

          Display the animation sequence as entered.   The  command is useful
          for seeing  how your  work is progressing.  The speed of the redraw
          may be controlled by  specifying a  number between  0 (fastest) and
          255 (slowest).  


       CHANGE CHARACTER - Edit a Character in Animation Sequence (ALT-W)

          Allows the  editing of  a mistyped animation entry.  Animation mode
          differs from the normal  edit  mode  in  that  simply  overtyping a
          character does not replace it.  In animation mode, both entries are
          remembered - the incorrect  character, plus  the wanted  one.  This
          command  permits  you  to  edit  something  without adding unwanted
          entries.


       ERASE CHARACTER - Delete a Character from Animation Sequence (ALT-Z)

          Deletes characters from the animation sequence.  As stated above in
          the CHANGE CHARACTER option, a character is not replaced or deleted
          in animation mode by overtyping.   To erase  something this command
          must  be  used.    Only  the  top-most character (the one currently
          visible) is removed; anything under it is left intact.


       INCLUDE FILES - Ansi/Ascii Include Files (ALT-J,Include)

          Allows text files created by  programs  other  than  TheDraw  to be
          inserted into  Animation sequences.   Particularly  useful for Ansi
          Music, BBS control codes, and often used sequences.

       LIMITING - Animation Sequence Editing (ALT-J,Limit) - Registered

          Limiting gives  total control  over the  animation sequence, making
          changes anywhere  trivial.   Normally all changes and additions are
          done on the end of the animation sequence.  By  using limiting, you
          can move the edit point to anywhere within the sequence.  

          Once the limit point has been set, TheDraw operates only up to that
          point.  All deletions, additions and correcting are  done where the
          limit is  specified.  Everything in the sequence above the limit is
          protected, temporarily out of the way.


       MARKER - Animation Markers (ALT-J,marKer) - Registered

          Markers are  used  to  "mark"  or  "tag"  different  places  in the
          animation sequence  for later  reference.  Once set, markers can be
          used for quickly changing the animation limit position  (see above)
          and viewing specific portions of the animation sequence.


       MOVEMENT STORAGE - Cursor Movement Storage (ALT-J,Movement)

          Controls whether  or not cursor movement is stored in the animation
          sequence.    Normally  only   characters  specifically   typed  are
          recorded.   With this  option turned  on however,  movements of the
          cursor are also saved (for example, using the mouse or arrow keys).


       RESCAN ANIMATION - Animation Screen Rescanning (ALT-J,Rescan)

          Creates a new animation  sequence using  the current  screen image.
          Any previous animation is lost (unless in animation limiting mode).


       PAUSE ANIMATION - Animation Pausing (ALT-J,Pause)

          Inserts  either  a  keyboard  or  timed  pause  into  the animation
          sequence.   Gives the opportunity to sit and reflect upon a certain
          presentation.  Note these pauses are  truly functional  only within
          TheDraw or  THEPP (The Presentation Program).  In Ansi files, timed
          pauses cannot be accurately saved.  Keyboard pauses  are flatly not
          possible with standard Ansi.

       The COLOR Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Use  this  menu  to  select  edit  colors.   Options are available for
       setting normal  edit  foreground  and  background  color,  the default
       background  color  used  for  erasing  areas,  and "picking up" colors
       currently used underneath the cursor.

                                 
                                  Fore/Back    
                                  Default      
                                  Under Cursor   
                                 

       FORE/BACK - Change New Character Fore/Background Color (ALT-A)

          Displays a screen showing available colors.   Simply  select wanted
          color using  mouse, arrow keys, or directly typing the number.  See
          also CTRL-UP/DOWN.


       DEFAULT - Change Default Erase Background Color (ALT-D)

          Similar to above, except  changes  default  color.    This  is used
          whenever  TheDraw  must  erase  an  area,  or otherwise deal with a
          "void" created by some operation.


       UNDER CURSOR - Use Colors Currently Under Cursor (ALT-U)

          Changes new character  fore/background  color  attributes  to those
          under the  edit cursor.   Very  useful for making quick updates and
          fixes.



       The TOGGLES Menu
       ----------------------------------------------------------------------
       The  Toggles  menu  contains  settings  for  controlling  how  TheDraw
       operates.   The settings  affect things like line draw or sprite mode,
       animation  mode  toggling,  character  insert  mode,  and  full screen
       editing.

                                 
                                  Draw Mode      
                                  Color Draw     
                                  Sprite Mode

       DRAW MODE - Line Draw Mode Toggle (ALT-M)

          Turns on/off line drawing mode.  Line drawing is accomplished using
          characters from function key sets 1 to 4.  In this mode, moving the
          cursor draws  a line.   Useful for creating abstract shapes quickly
          and easily.


       COLOR DRAW - Color Draw Mode Toggle (ALT--)

          Turns on/off color attribute drawing mode.  Color  drawing involves
          simply changing  characters to the current colors.  A manual way of
          easily painting an area a given color.


       SPRITE MODE - Sprite Editing Toggle (ALT-E,Toggle)

          Turns on/off TheDraw Sprite  Editing Mode.   Please  refer to ALT-E
          for discussion about this mode.

       ANIMATION MODE - Animation Mode Toggle (ALT-J)

          Changes TheDraw from Normal to Animation mode and visa versa.  When
          going from  Normal to  Animation mode,  a list  of available screen
          scanners are presented.  Refer to ALT-J for more details.


       INSERT MODE - Character Insert Mode Toggle (INSERT)

          Turns  on/off  character  insert  mode.    In  insert  mode, typing
          something bumps everything to the right  to make  room for  the new
          character.


       FULL SCREEN - Full Screen Editing Toggle (CTRL-PRTSC)

          Toggles using  the entire  screen for editing.  In full screen edit
          mode, the status line  along with  all indicators  disappear.  This
          makes the full 80 by 25 screen available for editing.

                        ALT-A: CHANGE TEXT COLOR ATTRIBUTES

       This function  allows you  to change the current color attributes used
       by TheDraw.  These attributes "color" any new characters placed on the
       screen.   When you press ALT-A, the screen will change to a display of
       the available and currently selected colors.

       The lower portion of the screen contains two prompts:

                      Please Select Foreground Color (0-31):
                      Please Select Background Color  (0-7):

       The cursor will be flashing immediately after the  first prompt.   You
       can now change the current foreground color via the Up/Down arrow keys
       or by directly typing  the number  associated with  a foreground color
       (see table  below).   Mouse users can position the mouse on the wanted
       color then press a button.

                   0  Black                  8  Dark Gray
                   1  Blue                   9  Light Blue
                   2  Green                 10  Light Green
                   3  Cyan                  11  Light Cyan
                   4  Red                   12  Light Red
                   5  Magenta               13  Light Magenta
                   6  Brown                 14  Yellow
                   7  Light Gray            15  White

       Characters can be made to blink by selecting colors from  the range 16
       through 31.  These match the above exactly, except they blink.  

       After  changing  the  foreground  color  (or leaving it alone) you can
       either proceed to the background colors  by pressing  [ENTER] or press
       [ESC] to  return to the edit screen.  The background color is selected
       in a fashion similar to the above.  Allowed values are the first eight
       (0 through  7) colors.   There are no background colors available that
       allow background blinking.

       Pressing either [ENTER] or [ESC] at this point will return to the edit
       screen.

       Notes:   It  is  possible  to  change  the colors without using ALT-A.
                Please see the Ctrl-Arrow Key commands for more details.

                Monochrome screen users will find background colors generally
                useless except when set to light gray (7) while using a black
                foreground color of 0 or 16 (blinking black).

                           ALT-B: BLOCK ACTION COMMANDS

       The Block Action Commands  provide  many  facilities  for  editing the
       current screen  and making  extensive changes.   The following options
       are available:

          o  Move or Copy blocks of text.
          o  Fill in areas with characters, colors or both.
          o  Perform left, right or center text justification.
          o  Draw boxes or outline text with lines quickly and easily.
          o  Delete or simply Erase blocks of text.
          o  Load a block of screen area from a file on disk.
          o  Save just a piece of the current screen to disk.
          o  Rescan an area into animation sequence (animation mode only).

       The Block Action Commands in TheDraw are one of the  more useful tools
       available.  After pressing ALT-B, you will see the following prompt:

         Use [L]ast block or move to Upper-Left corner and press [SPACE].

       Press [L]  to use  the last  block specified.   Otherwise define a new
       block by indicating the upper-left and  lower-right corners.   Use the
       arrow keys,  PgUp, PgDn,  Home or End keys on the keyboard to move the
       cursor to  the wanted  locations, then  press [SPACE]  after you reach
       each point.  

       The current block is highlighted (colors inverted) to make it obvious.
       Once you define the upper-left corner of the block, moving above or to
       the left  of it will not invert any text.  TheDraw will stop the block
       marking if you press [SPACE] under this situation.

       Upon pressing  [SPACE] the  second time  (with an  inverted block) you
       will see  the available block option commands.  The items on the menu,
       and their significance are described on the following pages.

       -----

       Mouse users may mark a block  by pressing  and holding  the LEFT mouse
       button,  moving  the  mouse  to  wanted  block size, and releasing the
       button.  Block option commands as described below will then appear.

       COPY - Copy a Block

          Copies the marked block.  Use mouse or normal cursor movement keys,
          such as  the arrow  keys, Tab,  PgUp, PgDn, Home or End to move the
          block copy around.  Available sub-commands are:

                pagE   - Change to a different page layer screen.   With this
                         option you can choose to stamp (see below) copies of
                         the block on other layers.   A small  window appears
                         with  a  prompt  for  the  new  page layer.  Enter a
                         number or press [ESC] to abort.

                Toggle - Toggles  between  single  layer  and  sprite editing
                         modes (see  ALT-E for discussion on sprite editing).
                         In sprite mode, any text on  a higher  numbered page
                         layer will appear "under" text on the current page.

                Stamp  - Makes  a  copy  of  the current block at the current
                         position.  Additional copies  can  be  made  as many
                         times as wished.  

                Under  - Toggles between  moving the block "above" or "under"
                         the current page layer.   The  block copy  starts in
                         above  mode.    In  above  mode  the entire block is
                         visible, no matter where  it  is  moved.    In under
                         mode, the  block appears UNDER any other text on the
                         current page layer.  It will  only show  through the
                         black spaces on the current layer.

                         Note:     Under  mode  also  allows  an  interesting
                                   effect.  If you  are  sprite  editing (see
                                   ALT-E  command)  the  block will appear to
                                   move -between- the current layer and those
                                   below it.

                [ENTER]  Saves all changes made to all layers.

                [ESC]    Aborts and removes all changes made to all layers.



       MOVE - Move a Block

          Moving a block operates identically to copying a block (see above).
          The only difference is the block  is  "cut"  out  from  the current
          screen, leaving a hole behind.  This hole is filled with spaces and
          the current  default  background  color  (see  ALT-D  regarding the
          default background  color).   All sub-commands are identical to the
          block copy described above.

       FILL - Fill a Block

          Fills the marked block  based  on  a  specified  sub-command.   The
          available options are listed below:

                Attribute - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
                            attributes  to  current  values  shown  in status
                            line.

                Fore      - Changes just  the foreground  color attributes to
                            current values shown in status line.

                bacK      - Changes just  the background  color attributes to
                            current values shown in status line.

                Use       - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
                            attributes to those  under  the  CURSOR  when you
                            first pressed  ALT-B.  This is not the upper-left
                            block corner, but the position on  the screen the
                            cursor  was  sitting  when  block  commands  were
                            first selected.

                Character - Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character  or  special
                            function set  symbol (see  ALT-F command).  Solid
                            spaces can be used by pressing  Shift-Space.  The
                            block  is  then  overwritten  using  whatever was
                            selected.  The color  attributes at  a given spot
                            are not changed, just the character there.  

                Both      - Combines  both  the  Attribute and Character fill
                            operations  described  above.    A  character  is
                            prompted  for,  then  everything  in the block is
                            overwritten using that character with the current
                            color attributes from the status line.


          These  commands  offer  much  flexibility;  however,  nothing  will
          satisfy everyone.   For  this reason,  the "last  block" option was
          added.  To perform multiple fill operations on a given block is now
          done quickly and easily.

          ----

          Note: In animation mode, the Attribute, Fore, bacK, and Use options
                actually change  characters in the animation sequence (no new
                characters are added).  Use of  the Character  or Both option
                in Animator  mode however  WILL add  additional characters to
                the animation sequence.

       TEXT - Block Text Operations

          Performs various text operations on the specified block.  Available
          sub-commands are:

                Box     - Draws a  box using  the current  function set.  The
                          box border is defined by  the  edges  of  the block
                          area.   The contents of the box are left unchanged,
                          however anything where the  box lines  are actually
                          drawn will be overwritten.

                Outline - Operates  similar  to  the  Box command, except the
                          contents of the block are examined first.   The box
                          border  will  be  adjusted  to just accommodate all
                          words either fully or  partially  contained  by the
                          block area.

                          For instance,  assume you just had one character in
                          the center of the edit screen.   You  then mark the
                          entire screen  as a block, and select text outline.
                          The result would only be  a  small  box  around the
                          character.    Going  the  other  way,  if you block
                          marked just the center letter of a long  word (with
                          no  spaces)   the  block   edges  would  expand  to
                          accommodate the entire word.    Note: the expansion
                          is only done for words INITIALLY part of the block.
                          Any words  the block  expansion happens  to go over
                          are  ignored,   and  are  not  considered  by  Text
                          Outline.

                Center  - Text contained or partially contained by  the block
                          is centered.   The  way this  is done is similar to
                          the text Outline described  above.    Each  line of
                          characters considered  is expanded  to just enclose
                          all words.  The string of words is then centered on
                          the position of the block.

                Left    - Text contained  or partially  contained is moved to
                          the left edge of the  block.    Block  expansion is
                          used so words are not split apart.

                Right   - Identical  to  Left  except  contained or partially
                          contained text is moved  to the  right edge  of the
                          block.


          These  commands  are  useful  making  menu  displays,  short memos,
          letters, etc...

       DELETE - Delete a Block

          This command is fairly intuitive.  The block is completely removed.
          Anything on the edit screen to the right of the block is shift over
          to fill in the space.  The area previously occupied  by the shifted
          text is  erased using  spaces and the default background color (see
          the ALT-D).


       ERASE - Erase a Block

          Erases the block, without  changing anything  other portion  of the
          edit  screen.    The  block  is erased using spaces and the default
          background color (see ALT-D).


       REPLACE - Block Character/Color Replace

          Performs character  and/or  color  attribute  replacement  on block
          based on  specified sub-command.  The pattern is whatever was under
          the cursor when ALT-G was  selected.    The  available  options are
          shown below (these are similar to the Fill options):

                Attribute -   Searches  both  foreground and background color
                              attributes,  then  replaces  all  matches  with
                              current values shown on status line.

                Fore       -  Searches and replaces just the foreground color
                              attributes with current value.

                bacK       -  Searches and replaces just the background color
                              attributes with current value.

                Character -   Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character or special
                              function set symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid
                              spaces  can  be  used  by pressing Shift-Space.
                              The block is then  searched and  all characters
                              matching the  pattern are replaced with the new
                              selection.  Color  attributes  at  any position
                              are not changed, just character values.

                Both       -  Combines  both   the  Attribute  and  Character
                              operations  described  above.    A  replacement
                              character is  prompted for,  then everything on
                              the screen matching the pattern (both character
                              and fore/back  attributes) is replaced with the
                              character and current colors.

       The following  commands are  available only  in normal (non-animation)
       screen edit mode:

       LOAD - Load a Block

          Imports a block of data from another screen saved on disk.  You are
          first prompted for the  import filespec  (see ALT-L  for details on
          loading files).  

          The import  image is  then loaded  onto the screen, and an inverted
          area of the defined block size  appears.   Move this  inverted area
          using arrow  keys, PgUp,  PgDn, Home  or End to the wanted portion.
          Press [ENTER] to save a copy of the  inverted area  in the original
          edit screen.  The rest of the import image is discarded.


       SAVE - Save a Block

          Operates almost  identically to the normal save screen command (see
          ALT-S for information on  saving  edit  screens).    The difference
          being the save is restricted to the defined block.   


       The following command is available only in animation edit mode:

       RESCAN - Rescan a Block

          Operates just  like the  ALT-J animator  rescan option, except only
          the marked block is rescanned.   The  marked  block  area  is first
          erased from the animation sequence, then the block is rescanned and
          added onto the end of sequence.




                            ALT-C: CLEAR CURRENT SCREEN

       The operation of this command should be apparent.  Once  selected, the
       following prompt appears:

          Do you want to CLEAR this Page or All Page Layers? (Yes/No/All)

       Selecting [Y]es  or pressing [ENTER] will clear the current page layer
       and nothing else.   Selecting [N]o  or pressing  [ESC] will  abort the
       command.  

       Selecting  [A]ll  will  clear  ALL  page  layers.  You are prompted to
       verify  this  request  before  continuing.    Useful  if  you  want  a
       completely clean slate.

       The clearing  of a  given page  layer is  done by using spaces and the
       default background color (see ALT-D below).

                        ALT-D: SET DEFAULT BACKGROUND COLOR

       The default  background color  is used  whenever TheDraw  must erase a
       portion of the screen.  Examples of commands where this is used are:

          o  Clear Current Screen.
          o  Block Delete, Erase, and Move.
          o  Text Operations which move words.
          o  Use of the Backspace or Delete keys to remove characters.
          o  Inserting or Deleting of Lines.

       All  these  commands  "clear"  an  area  of  the  screen in one way or
       another.  TheDraw does  this using  spaces and  the default background
       color specified.

       When you  select ALT-D,  the screen  changes to a display of available
       colors and the current default background color.  In the lower portion
       of the screen is the prompt:

                      Please Select Background Color (0-7): 

       The  cursor  will  be  flashing  after this prompt.  Select the wanted
       default background  color via  the Up/Down  arrow keys  or by directly
       entering the  number associated  with a color (see ALT-A for available
       colors).  Mouse users simply position  the mouse  on the  wanted color
       and press a button.

       Press [ENTER] or [ESC] to return to the edit screen.




                           ALT-E: EXCHANGE EDIT SCREENS

       The exchange edit screen command allows you to select a different page
       layer for editing.   Up to  eight simultaneous  layers can  be used at
       once, in  either normal  or animation  modes.  With this facility, you
       can load several images, copy/exchange parts and do much more.

       After pressing ALT-E, the following prompt appears:

             Display Page Layer (1-8), Toggle Single/Layers, or [ESC]?

       The number of available  layers (8  here) will  vary depending  on how
       TheDraw has been configured.  To select a different page layer, simply
       press the number.   The second  option, [T]oggle  Single/Layers, is to
       toggle  the  sprite  editing  facility  of  TheDraw.    Sprite mode is
       indicated by the word  "Page" or  "Anim" appearing  in capital letters
       on the status line (ie: PAGE).




       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              39       




       Sprite editing  allows you  to see everything "underneath" the current
       page layer.  Imagine several sheets  of glass,  stacked on  top of one
       another.    If  you  look  down  from  the top-most sheet, you can see
       anything placed on a piece of glass lower down.

       The sprite  editing mode  of TheDraw  is akin  to the  layers of glass
       described above.   In  this case,  layer one  is the top-most sheet of
       glass.  Page layer eight (8) is the bottom-most sheet of glass.  ie:

                                       
                                      .      .         
                                    .      .    Bottom-Most Layer
                                     8
                                
                                  .
                                      3 .  
              Top-Most Layer         2
                                    1
                             

       Naturally, an  object  or  character  closer  to  the  top  will cover
       anything under  it.  In TheDraw, anything other than a non-solid black
       space will conceal the contents of a lower layer (see  SHIFT-SPACE for
       information on solid spaces).

       Another useful  feature about  sprite editing is only the current page
       layer may be changed.  Nothing you do will alter a layer  below (short
       of clearing  all layers),  even though  you can see its contents.  The
       current layer can be globally moved,  have lines  inserted or deleted,
       etc...    Anything  lower  down  is  protected unless you specifically
       change to that page layer for editing.  

       The question than now comes to mind is:  What can be done with it?  
       Imagine you have a  screen  made  of  several  distinct  parts,  say a
       backdrop with  figures on it.  Now a figure must be moved to make room
       for something  else.   Unless "block"  shaped, the  block move command
       (ALT-B) is  tedious to  use.  For something tree shaped, an easier way
       is desired.

       Using sprite editing each figure could  have its  own layer,  with the
       backdrop  placed  on  the  bottom-most  page.    To move a figure, you
       merely switch to its layer and  use  the  global  screen  move command
       (ALT-G,M).    Nothing  could  be  simpler.   To see the result of your
       change, switch back to the top-most layer.

       Menu making is made easier with sprites also.  Put  together the basic
       outline (lines,  boxes, etc...)  on one page layer, then switch to one
       higher up for the text.  If you do not like the  initial text, erasing
       it will  not harm  the outline.   There are endless more possibilities
       waiting to be discovered.



       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              40       




                           ALT-F: VIEW FUNCTION KEY SETS

       This command simply shows a  display  of  the  150  special characters
       supported by TheDraw.  These characters are stored in fifteen separate
       "function key sets".  The current  set  is  displayed  on  the TheDraw
       status line.

       Selecting function  key sets  is divided between two commands.  To use
       function key sets 1 to 10, press ALT followed by  a function  key 1 to
       10.   To use  function key  sets 11  to 15,  press CTRL  followed by a
       function key 1 to 5.  ie: 

                       ALT-F7 will select function key set 7
                      CTRL-F4 will select function key set 14

       The  actual  characters  are  accessed  using  the  function  keys  by
       themselves.   If function  key set 7 was selected, pressing [F2] would
       display the second character in that set (a smiley face).

       Note:    Appendix  C  contains  a  list  of   all  special  characters
                supported  by  the  IBM-PC  extended character set in numeric
                order.    To  access  these  characters  -without-  using the
                function  key  sets,  press  and  hold down the ALT key.  Now
                using the numeric keypad on the side of the keyboard, type in
                the number  associated with the wanted character.  Once done,
                release the ALT key.  The  character will  then appear.   ie:
                press and  hold ALT.   Now type 65 on the numeric keypad, and
                release ALT.  The letter "A" will appear.




                              ALT-G: GLOBAL COMMANDS

       The global commands offer many facilities  for doing  "global" changes
       to the  entire screen.  All of these commands could be duplicated with
       block  operations;  they  exist   for  convenience.     The  following
       selections are available:

          o  Copy the current screen to another page layer.
          o  Move/Rotate the current screen around its borders.
          o  Globally fill the screen with colors and/or characters.
          o  Perform text operations globally on the screen.
          o  Globally replace a character or color with something else.

       After  pressing  ALT-G  the  available  commands are listed.  The menu
       items are described on the following pages.






       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              41       




       COPY - Copy Screen

          The command first prompts  for the  destination page.   The current
          screen is then copied to the specified page layer.  

          In  animation  mode,  this  deletes  everything  on the destination
          layer.  The current screen is then copied item by item to it.
          

       MOVE - Move/Rotate Screen

          Moves the entire screen around its borders.  Use the arrows keys to
          rotate the  screen.  Press [ENTER] when satisfied or [ESC] to leave
          the screen as it was.   ie: moving the screen upwards will "rotate"
          the line at the top of the screen down to the bottom of the screen.


       FILL - Fill Screen

          Fills  the  entire  screen  based  on a specified sub-command.  The
          available options are listed  below  (these  are  identical  to the
          block fill commands):

                Attribute - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
                            attributes  to  current  values  shown  in status
                            line.

                Fore      - Changes just  the foreground  color attributes to
                            current values shown in status line.

                bacK      - Changes just  the background  color attributes to
                            current values shown in status line.

                Use       - Changes  both  foreground  and  background  color
                            attributes to those  under  the  CURSOR  when you
                            first pressed ALT-G.  This is the position on the
                            screen  the   cursor  was   sitting  when  global
                            commands were selected.

                Character - Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character  or  special
                            function set symbol (see  ALT-F command).   Solid
                            spaces can  be used by pressing Shift-Space.  The
                            screen is  then  overwritten  using  whatever was
                            selected.    The  color  attributes  at any given
                            position are not changed,  just the  character at
                            that position.

                Both      - Combines  both  the  Attribute and Character fill
                            operations  described  above.    A  character  is
                            prompted  for,  then  everything on the screen is
                            overwritten using that character with the current
                            color attributes from the status line.


          In animation  mode, the Attribute, Fore, bacK, and Use options only
          alter characters already in  the animation  sequence (no additional
          characters are  added).  The Character or Both options however WILL
          add additional characters to the animation sequence.

        
       TEXT - Global Text Operations

          Performs various text operations on  the  screen.    Available sub-
          commands are:

                Box     - Draws a  box using  the current  function set.  The
                          box border will be the defined by the  edges of the
                          screen.   The inside  of the box is left unchanged,
                          however anything where the  box lines  are actually
                          drawn will be overwritten.

                Outline - Operates  similar  to  the Box command, however the
                          contents of the block are examined first.   The box
                          border  will  be  adjusted  to just accommodate all
                          words contained by the screen.

                          For instance, assume you just had  one character in
                          the center of the edit screen.  The result of using
                          global text  outline  would  only  be  a  small box
                          around the character.

                Center  - Text in  the screen  is centered.   The way this is
                          done  is  similar  to  the  text  Outline described
                          above.    Each  line  of  characters  considered is
                          reduced to just enclose all words.   The  string of
                          words is then centered in the screen.

                Left    - Text is moved to the left edge of the screen.  

                Right   - Identical to Left except text is moved to the right
                          edge of the screen.

       REPLACE - Global Character/Color Replace

          Performs character and/or  color  attribute  replacement  on entire
          screen based on specified sub-command.  The pattern is whatever was
          under the cursor when  ALT-G was  selected.   The available options
          are shown below (these are similar to the Fill options):

                Attribute -   Searches  both  foreground and background color
                              attributes,  then  replaces  all  matches  with
                              current values shown on status line.

                Fore       -  Searches and replaces just the foreground color
                              attributes with current value.

                bacK       -  Searches and replaces just the background color
                              attributes with current value.

                Character -   Prompts  for  a  keyboard  character or special
                              function set symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid
                              spaces  can  be  used  by pressing Shift-Space.
                              The screen is then searched and  all characters
                              matching the  pattern are replaced with the new
                              selection.  Color  attributes  at  any position
                              are not changed, just character values.

                Both       -  Combines  both   the  Attribute  and  Character
                              operations  described  above.    A  replacement
                              character is  prompted for,  then everything on
                              the screen matching the pattern (both character
                              and fore/back  attributes) is replaced with the
                              character and current colors. 

          These commands operate similar to the block action text commands.




                          ALT-H: DISPLAY HELP INFORMATION

       The help  screens provide  a quick  reminder for  the various commands
       supported  by  TheDraw.    The  three  screens  briefly  describe most
       available functions.

       The registered  version of  TheDraw supports  context sensitive pop-up
       help  for  the  ENTIRE  program.    Typing  ALT-H at any position will
       display specific help on what you are doing.  Try it, you'll like it!

                               ALT-I: INSERT A LINE

       Inserts a  line at  the current  position.   The current  line and all
       those  below  it  are  shifted  down.   The bottom line is lost.  This
       command is not reversible, so use with care.




                              ALT-J: ANIMATOR OPTIONS

       The Animator Options command  operates differently  depending on which
       mode you are currently in (normal or animator).


       ALT-J FROM NORMAL MODE
       ______________________________________________________________________

       When in  normal mode,  selecting ALT-J will put TheDraw into animation
       mode.  To convert the existing normal screen images (static images) to
       animation entries,  a "scan method" must be specified.  The particular
       scan method used tells TheDraw how  to  read  your  static  images for
       display.  Ten different scan methods are available:

       TOP - Scan Top to Bottom

          The static  page layers are scanned from their upper-left to lower-
          right corners.  The scan goes  across the  screen (left  to right).
          The next line down is then scanned, and so on.


       LEFT - Scan Left to Right

          Similar  to  TOP,  except  the  scan  goes  down the screen (top to
          bottom).  The next column over is then scanned, and so on.


       CLOCK - Clock Arm Scan

          Scans in clockwise direction from center  of screen  to border edge
          around screen.  Appears somewhat like a growing pie-slice.


       CIRCLES - Circular Ring Scan

          Scans image in ever growing circles from center of screen outwards.
          ie:  small circle, then slightly  larger encompassing  circle, then
          slightly larger again, etc...

       CHECKERBOARD - Checkerboard Effect Scan 

          Scans  alternating  squares  on  first pass creating a checkerboard
          appearance, then fills in all the gaps on the second pass.


       ANGLE - Angle Scan

          Scans  each  static  page  layer  from  upper-left  to  lower-right
          corners, using  a backward angle approach.  ie: scan character then
          move down to next line and backup one position.

                                   DDDDDDD
                                   etc...

       GATE - Gated Scan

          Alternating lines scan from opposite sides  of the  screen forwards
          and backwards  going across.     The first  line will  scan left to
          right going across the screen.  The second line scans right to left
          across the  screen.  The third line scans as the first, etc...  All
          lines are processed at once, so the screen appears "gated". 


       PYRAMID - Pyramid Scan

          Scans in a "pyramid" shape, starting from bottom center of screen.
                                        .
                                       .D.

       SQUARES - Squares or Spiral Scan

          Scans static screen images using squares.  The border of the screen
          is first  scanned (progressing clockwise).  The next smaller square
          is then scanned, and so.  Produces a spiral effect.


       SCRAMBLE - Random Scramble Scan

          Each static page layer is scanned in a completely random order.

       DOOR - Closing Door Scan

          Screen is scanned from top to  bottom, on  both sides  of screen at
          once.  Gives the impression of doors closing on the user.


       DIAMOND - Growing Diamond Scan

          Scans image using ever growing diamond shapes from center of screen
          outwards.  Mildly similar to the circle scan in operation.


       WIGGLE - Wiggle Scan

          Similar to GATE, except only  one  line  is  processed  at  a time.
          Produces a  snaking line  appearance starting  from the  top of the
          screen.  Scan first goes across screen, then returns on  next.  The
          cycle is then repeated.


       WIGGLEOUT - Wiggle Out Scan

          Starts in  center of screen with wiggle operation going both up and
          down at once.


       Once the animation  scan  is  completed,  the  screen  is  cleared and
       redrawn.    At  this  point  TheDraw will operate normally, except all
       entries are sequenced by the animation  system.   Please refer  to the
       section "The Animation System" for more details on its use.

       The registered version of TheDraw also supports:

          o  Animation Position Editing (Sequence Limiting)
          o  Specify Animation Markers

       Each item on the menu is described below:


       INCLUDE - Specify Animation Include File

          When creating an ANSI  file, TheDraw  allows you  to "include" text
          from other files in the new one being created.  Ten different files
          can be included at various points in the sequence.

          When TheDraw includes another  file, its  contents are  copied into
          the new  output file  TheDraw is making.  Once the output Ansi file
          is created, the include file is not needed again.  The include file
          need only be present when TheDraw is actually copying text from it.

          Include files are only accessed  when  TheDraw  is  saving  a file.
          They are  ignored by  ALT-Q.   If you  wish to  see what everything
          looks like before saving, use the View option described below.

          Upon choosing the INCLUDE  option,  a  window  will  appear  on the
          screen.   All currently defined include files will be listed, along
          with their positions in the animation sequence.  The following sub-
          commands are available:

             SET   - Sets an  include file at the current animation position.
                     In the shareware version of TheDraw, this will always be
                     the end of the current animation sequence.  

                     In the registered version, this is the current animation
                     limit position.  This allows include files to  be easily
                     specified  "after  the  fact", anywhere in the animation
                     sequence (see Limit below).

             CLEAR - Erases the include file entry you specify.  No verify is
                     done before the entry is deleted, so be warned.

             VIEW  - Displays  the   entire  animation   sequence,  with  all
                     specified include  files.   Very useful  for testing the
                     appearance of things.


          Press [ESC]  once when done editing the include files.  All changes
          are saved.

          ANSI MUSIC

             Animation include files are  especially useful  for including so
             called "Ansi  Music" sequences into a TheDraw image.  Ansi Music
             is not part of  the standard  Ansi driver.   It  is an extension
             found in  certain modem communication programs (such as Qmodem).
             Please note  that  TheDraw  cannot  generate  Ansi  Music source
             sequences.  The code format of Ansi Music is as follows:

                       <esc>[MF<music control codes><ctrl-N>
                                                      
                       ascii 27                     ascii 14  

             The  <music  control  codes>  is  a  string of music descriptors
             identical to those used in the Basic PLAY  command.   Refer to a
             Basic language reference manual for further information.

             Other uses  are often  used images  or complex  BBS control code
             sequences (for systems such as WildCat).   The  following option
             is more suitable for the latter however.
        

       USER_SEQ - Specify Animation User Control Sequence

          Allows you to insert your own short control code sequences directly
          into the Ansi file output TheDraw generates.   Extremely useful for
          BBS  control  codes  (ie:  for  user  names and such), or inserting
          special extra Ansi  codes  into  the  animation  (ie:  clearing the
          display midstream,  or causing an image to scroll).  User Sequences
          are only referred to when TheDraw  saves a  file, and  are not used
          when redrawing (see ALT-Q).  

          Upon  choosing  the  USER_SEQ  option,  a window will appear on the
          screen.  All  currently  defined  user  control  sequences  will be
          listed, along  with their positions in the animation sequence.  The
          following sub-commands are available:

             SET   - Sets a user sequence at the  current animation position.
                     In the shareware version of TheDraw, this will always be
                     the end of the current animation sequence.  

                     In the registered version, this is the current animation
                     limit position.   This allows control codes to be easily
                     specified after a screen has been  made, anywhere during
                     the display of the animation sequence (see Limit below).

             CLEAR - Removes the  user sequence entry you specify.  No verify
                     is done before the entry is deleted, so be warned.

             VIEW  - Displays the  animation  sequence,  up  to  the position
                     where  the  specified  user  sequence  is  to be output.
                     Useful for jogging your memory.

       LIMIT - Specify Animation Limit (registered version only)

          The animation limit facility of  TheDraw  provides  for  a powerful
          animation editing system.  You can easily correct mistakes, insert,
          delete or do anything else in the MIDDLE of any animation sequence.

          To use limiting, you tell  TheDraw  where  to  stop  displaying the
          animation sequence.   For  example, assume  you had a sequence with
          5000 entries.  You could  limit  it  to  2000,  correct  a spelling
          mistake, then  quickly reset the limit back to 5000.  With limiting
          turned on TheDraw operates as always,  except everything  above the
          animation limit is temporarily held out of the way.

          Upon choosing the LIMIT option, you can specify the animation limit
          position by means of the following keys:

             Up/Down Arrows   Advance/Backup limit by one position.
             PgUp/PgDn        Advance/Backup limit by 100 positions.
             Home             Go to start of sequence (position = 0).
             End              Go to end of sequence (all entries).

             marKer           Move to the position of an animation marker. 
                              Selecting this command displays a window of all
                              currently   set   animation   markers.    After
                              choosing a marker, the animation limit moves to
                              the position  of the marker.  Assuming you have
                              set markers in  strategic  places,  this allows
                              you  to  quickly  bounce  around  an  animation
                              sequence looking for a particular spot.

          Press [ENTER] to save the  new  animation  limit.    Pressing [ESC]
          leaves the original animation limit position unchanged.


       MARKER - Specify Animation Markers (registered version only)

          Markers  are  used  to  "mark"  different  places  in the animation
          sequence for later reference.  Once  set, markers  can be  used for
          changing the  animation limit position (see above) and viewing just
          portions of the  animation  sequence.      They  can  be  useful in
          locating things  forgotten or set aside until later, editing images
          a page at a time, etc...

          Upon choosing the  MARKER  option,  a  window  will  appear  on the
          screen.  All currently defined markers are listed, along with their
          position in the animation sequence.

          The following sub-commands are available:

             SET   - Sets a marker at the current animation limit position.  
                     This allows markers to  be easily  specified anywhere in
                     the animation  sequence.   You are first be prompted for
                     which marker to change.  If  the marker  is already set,
                     it will  be erased before continuing.  After you specify
                     a marker, you can then enter a comment (32 characters).

             CLEAR - Erases the marker you specify.  No verify is done before
                     the entry is deleted, so be warned.

             VIEW  - Displays  the  animation  sequence,  up  to  a specified
                     marker.  Useful for  reminding yourself  of what happens
                     early in a 16000 entry animation sequence.

          Press [ESC] once done editing markers.  All changes are saved.



       MOVEMENT - Toggle Storage of Cursor Movements

          Toggles  whether  or  not  TheDraw  stores  actual movements of the
          cursor.  Normally only typed characters  are recorded;  however, if
          the cursor  movement toggle  is on  all movements of the cursor are
          also stored.  Cursor movements are  being stored  whenever the ANIM
          symbol in  the status line is flashing.  If you are still in doubt,
          watch the animation entry count.  It will  increase every  time you
          move the cursor. 


       NORMAL - Convert to Normal Edit Mode.

          Converts what  appears on  the screen  to normal  mode images.  All
          animation is erased after  executing this  command.   You are first
          prompted to verify this before continuing.

          In  the  registered  version,  anything  not  displayed  because of
          animation limiting is lost.    Only  what  appears  exactly  on the
          screen when  you select  this command  is converted  to normal mode
          images.

       RESCAN - Rescan the Screens

          Selecting this command prompts  for  an  animation  scan  method as
          described above  in the ALT-J FROM NORMAL MODE section.  Everything
          in the animation sequence is first erased, then  the images  on the
          screens are rescanned.   

          In  the  registered  version,  any animation sequence not displayed
          because of animation limiting  is  NOT  lost.    It  will  still be
          available  after  this  operation  is  done.  This differs from the
          above sub-option and permits rebuilding something which did not cut
          it the first time.


       PAUSE - Animation Pausing

          Allows  for  the  putting  of  pauses  into the animation sequence.
          TheDraw can wait for either a  key press  or a  specified number of
          seconds.   There is  no limit on pauses and they may occur anywhere
          in  the  animation  sequence.      This  can  be  very   useful  in
          presentations.

          After selecting PAUSE, the following sub-commands are available:

             TIME_PAUSE       Creates  a  pause  for  a  specified  number of
                              seconds (the pause can  be aborted  by pressing
                              any  key  when  actually  displayed).   You are
                              prompted for the number of seconds to delay.

             KEY_ONLY_PAUSE   Creates a pause for a key to be pressed.

             CLEAR            Erases  pauses  from  the  animation  sequence.
                              TheDraw  searches  backwards  from  the current
                              animation position for  a  Pause.    If  one is
                              found, you  can DELETE,  VIEW up to this pause,
                              or scan for the  NEXT  pause  before  this one.
                              Press [ESC] to abort clearing a pause.

          Pauses are observed whenever you redraw the animation sequence with
          ALT-Q.  When you save an ANSI file, it is  not possible  to produce
          the exact  pause equivalent (pauses for a key are impossible).  For
          this reason,  a  small  separate  presentation  program  (THEPP) is
          included  with   registered  copies   of  TheDraw.    This  program
          duplicates the operation of the  ALT-Q  command,  and  uses THEDRAW
          format data files.  See section entitled "The Presentation Program"
          for information on using THEPP.

                               ALT-K: DELETE A FILE 

       Deletes a specified file from disk.  Use this option  to free  up disk
       space when  the need  arises.   The directory file selector (see ALT-L
       below) displays everything in  the current  directory.   Use the arrow
       keys to select a file to delete, or simply type in the filename at the
       bottom of the screen.  Press [ENTER] to select the file.  

       TheDraw will then check for the file.  If it exists, you  are prompted
       to  verify  before  continuing.    This is your last chance before you
       delete something you might regret later.  



                           ALT-L: LOAD SCREEN FROM DISK

       This command allows you to load any ANSI  text, ANSI  Animation, ASCII
       text,  BINARY  dump,  Basic  BSAVE,  TheDraw  Object,  TheDraw COM, or
       TheDraw (.TD) format file.  

       You are prompted to continue if the current screen image  has not been
       saved.   The directory  file selector  next displays  all files in the
       current directory for convenience.  The selector cursor may be used to
       choose  a  file,  or  a  filename  can be typed in directly.  Move the
       selector cursor via the  arrow and  PgUp/PgDn keys.   To  see the pick
       list of  last 10  files accessed, press the TAB key.  Press [ENTER] to
       load the file.

       If there are many files in the directory,  a wildcard  filename can be
       used  to  display  a  partial  listing of those available.   Wildcards
       operate as found  in  Dos.    Please  refer  to  your  Dos  manual for
       additional information.  Wildcards are normally temporary, and are not
       maintained between directory invocations.  They  can be  made "sticky"
       however by use of the Setup utility.

       If  you  type  in  the  filename,  a  file extension is assumed unless
       otherwise specified.  The  assumed value  is ".ANS"  unless changed in
       the setup  options.   The following  file types  require the specified
       extensions for TheDraw to be able to load them: 

                               Binary Dump      .BIN
                               Basic BSAVE      .BSV
                               TheDraw COM File .COM
                               TheDraw OBJ File .OBJ
                               TheDraw Format   .TD

       (Note:  The above filename extensions can be changed in  Setup Options
       menu with TheDraw, or via the Setup Utility Defaults option).

       A  file  without  one  of  the  above  is  assumed to be an ANSI file.
       Assembler, Pascal, and C  format files  cannot be  reloaded, except as
       Ascii  text.    You  must  keep  another  copy of those screens safely
       somewhere in one of the above loadable formats.

       Binary, BSave,  COM, Object  (OBJ), and  TheDraw format  files are all
       reloadable and  may contain either a full screen or small block image.
       Where a block is displayed depends upon the  file format.   Binary and
       Object formats  load in the upper-left corner.  Formatting information
       is not stored with binary blocks however, so  TheDraw will  prompt for
       block width before loading.
        
       BSave and  COM formats load in the same locations they were originally
       saved from.  The TheDraw format is more flexible however,  placing you
       automatically into block copy/move mode to position the block.

       When loading Ansi or Ascii, only the first screen full is stored.  Any
       extra lines below the first screen are discarded.   Do  not be alarmed
       by Ansi  files which  might be  hundreds (or thousands) of lines long.
       So long as the cursor never  goes  below  the  bottom  of  the screen,
       everything will load properly.

       Ansi  animation   is  automatically  detected  by  TheDraw  using  the
       following advanced system:  If the cursor suddenly moves to a place it
       normally could never go, the file must be animated. 




                              ALT-M: SELECT DRAW MODE

       TheDraw supports  the "drawing"  of lines.   This is easily done using
       the arrow keys while in Draw mode.   The characters used  in the lines
       are those  available via  the function  keys from the current function
       key set.  Only the first four sets of characters contain lines.   If a
       function  key  set  without  lines  is selected, the first set (single
       lines) is used.   Draw mode  is indicated  by the  word "Draw"  at the
       bottom of the screen.

       In draw  mode, everything  operates without  change.  Typed characters
       still appear.   The only change is that using  the arrow  keys makes a
       line appear in the direction moved.




                                   ALT-N: RULER

       The Ruler  command places  a pair of intersecting lines on the screen.
       The point of intersection represents the position of  the cursor.   It
       is useful for lining up rows or columns of text or figures.



       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              54       




       The ruler  can be  moved using  all normal  cursor keys (ie: the arrow
       keys, Tab, PgUp, PgDn, Home, End, etc...).  Press [ENTER]  to save the
       new cursor  location, or  press [ESC]  to return to the initial cursor
       position.

       The ruler can held on the  screen during  normal editing  by selecting
       [S]ticky mode.   The  ruler will  appear under  the current layer.  To
       turn off the sticky ruler, simply select ALT-N again then press [ESC].



                         ALT-O: CHANGE DRIVE/SUB DIRECTORY

       This command allows you to change  the Dos  default directory  or path
       (displayed when  loading or  viewing a  file).  All sub-directories of
       the current path are displayed  for  you.    A  new  directory  can be
       selected by  using the  arrows keys  or typing in the pathname.  Press
       [ENTER] to change to it.  Note that the details of sub-directories are
       not covered here.  Please refer to your dos manual for that.

       For example,  if you  were on  drive C in a sub-directory named GAMES,
       you could switch to the subdirectory  UTILITY of  drive D  by entering
       "D:\UTILITY".    You  could  then  get  back to the directory GAMES by
       simply entering "C:" (no backslash).



                            Alt-P:  PAINT/FILL COMMANDS

       This command allows enclosed areas to be easily filled with characters
       and/or  attributes.    An  enclosed  area is made by using lines (from
       function key sets 1-4) or using the Draw command (see ALT-M).   To use
       this command, position the cursor inside the area then press ALT-P.  

       The following sub-commands are available:

         ATTRIBUTE   Changes all  foreground and  background color attributes
                     within the enclosed area  to those  values shown  in the
                     status line.

         FORE        Changes only  the foreground color attributes within the
                     enclosed area to the current foreground value.

         BACK        Changes only the background color attributes  within the
                     enclosed area to the current background value.

         CHARACTER   Prompts for a keyboard character or special function set
                     symbol (see ALT-F command).  Solid spaces can be used by
                     pressing Shift-Space.   All enclosed characters are then
                     overwritten using  whatever  was  specified.    No color
                     attributes are changed, just actual character symbols.


       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              55       




         BOTH        Combines   both   the   Attribute  and  Character  paint
                     operations above.  A  character  is  prompted  for, then
                     everything  in   the  area  is  overwritten  using  that
                     character with the  current  color  attributes  from the
                     status line.

       In animation  mode, the  Character and Both options add new entries to
       the animation sequence; nothing is  deleted.    The  Attribute command
       however only changes the color attributes of characters already in the
       animation sequence.  No new entries are added.



                               ALT-Q: REDRAW SCREEN
                        (available in animation mode only)

       This command redraws the animation sequence on the screen.   With this
       you can  see how  your work  is developing.   You are prompted for the
       display speed to redraw at.  Available speeds are from  0 (fastest) to
       255 (crawl).   A  value of  about 40 is generally a good speed to view
       at.  Be warned that 255 literally is a crawl speed, displaying between
       two and  four characters  per second  (standard PC/XT).  A slow redraw
       can be broken out of by pressing any key.



                            ALT-R: RESTORE CURRENT LINE

       Restores current line to original contents.    Useful  if  you  make a
       mistake while  entering text.  Removes all changes to the line made by
       the user.  Once you move off to  a new  line however,  any changes are
       permanent.  



                            ALT-S: SAVE SCREEN TO DISK

       The  Save  Screen  command  offers  many formats for saving the entire
       current screen.    The  available  formats  are:    Ansi,  Ascii, Asm,
       Binary, BSave,  Com, C, Pascal, Object, and TheDraw.  Please note that
       all color attributes are  lost in  an Ascii  file.   All other formats
       store  the  complete  screen  with color information (unless specified
       otherwise).

       The entire screen is saved when  using this  command.   If you  do not
       require the  full video,  use a  block save (see ALT-B).  These can be
       more effective at times.

       You are first prompted for which storage format to use.   In animation
       mode, only  ANSI and  THEDRAW formats are available.  The items on the
       menu are discussed below.


       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              56       




       ANSI - Ansi text file

          You are first asked what initial screen preparation you want before
          the image is displayed.  Options are: 

                CLEAR - Clears the screen
                HOME  - Move cursor to upper-left corner of screen
                NONE  - Leave screen and cursor position as is.

          The next prompt is for the maximum length of each line in the saved
          file.   TheDraw is  capable of  producing over  1300 characters per
          screen line (if every character had a differing color combination).
          Some applications and  programs  (ie:  other  text  editors) cannot
          handle so  many characters per line.  This option limits the output
          line length sacrificing time to display the image.  If length is no
          problem, specify [N]one for the most efficient file.

          Lastly, you  are prompted for the Ansi display speed (a number from
          0 to 50).  The operation  is similar  to the  ALT-Q animator redraw
          screen function.   Things are slowed down by adding redundant codes
          after displayed characters.  A value  of 50  is approximately equal
          to an  ALT-Q speed  of 255  (extremely slow).  Experimentation will
          find the most appropriate speed for your needs.  


       ASCII - Ascii Text (no colors)

          If you select ASCII,  you are  prompted if  you really  want a non-
          color image  made before  continuing.   The Ascii  file produced is
          similar to any file  produced by  a normal  text editor  (ie: Turbo
          Pascal or Sidekick editor).  

          There is  one difference  in the  approach used by TheDraw however.
          Lines of Ascii that  are the  full 80  character screen  width, are
          normally NOT  terminated with  a carriage  return sequence (CR/LF).
          Such Ascii files viewed via the  Dos TYPE  command display properly
          but do  not load correctly into most other software.  Therefore, an
          option to force CR/LF was added  to the  Setup Options  menu within
          TheDraw, and  the Setup  Utility Defaults area.  Set this toggle if
          you are having difficulties.


       ASM - Assembly Language 

          ASM produces a list of  DB  data  statements  for  use  by assembly
          language  programmers.    Additional  sub-options  are available to
          specify the assembler data format.    You  can  specify  to Crunch,
          output only Ascii characters, or generate a normal file.  Crunching
          uses a custom technique for compressing  color changes  and strings
          of identical  characters to  make the  smallest possible  file.  To
          display  a  crunched  file  you  must  use  the  uncruncher routine


       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              57       



          included  separately  with  TheDraw  (UNCRUNCH.ASM).  This file has
          comments explaining its  use.    It  is  compatible  with Microsoft
          (MASM) and  Borland (TASM)  assemblers.   Simple formatting changes
          may be required for other vendors assemblers.

          The Ascii format saves all characters  on  the  screen.    No color
          attribute information  is stored  however.   The Normal format is a
          pure  binary  dump  of  the  screen,  converted  to   an  assembler
          compatible format.

          You are also prompted for a reference identifier to use.  This will
          be the  name used  to access  the data  within a  program.  TheDraw
          takes this  and generates  statements to simplify programming.  For
          instance, assume a standard full screen with the default IMAGEDATA:

                IMAGEDATA_WIDTH EQU 80
                IMAGEDATA_DEPTH EQU 25
                IMAGEDATA_LENGTH EQU 4000
                IMAGEDATA LABEL BYTE
                     ... data for screen image follows here ...

          The width and depth statements reflect  the character  dimension of
          the image  saved.  Saving a block changes them appropriately.  This
          facilitates easier program development.  Instead of directly coding
          block sizes  refer to  the above identifiers.  Thus eliminating the
          need to remember arbitrary block sizes.


       BINARY - Binary Screen Dump

          Produces a straight data byte dump of the video screen.   This data
          format is  generic.   It is useful for many things, such as loading
          screen images directly to video ram,  etc...    This  will  be 4000
          bytes for a standard 80x25 screen, larger for EGA/VGA displays.


       BSAVE - Basic BSave Screen Dump

          This  file  is  identical  to  a binary screen dump, except loading
          codes for Basic are placed at the front.  These files can be loaded
          from basic with:

                     DEF SEG = &HB800 : BLOAD"filespec.BSV",0

          If you have a monochrome monitor, replace the B800 with B000 in the
          above line.

       COM - Dos Executable COM Files.

          Produces a truly separate program executable from Dos by typing the
          program name.   COM  files are  useful in  batch files and the like
          for -fast- displaying.  COM file screen blocks  (via ALT-B) display
          only  the   block  without  changing  anything  else.    You  could
          conceivably  generate  a  "layering"  windows  effect   if  you  so
          desired.   TheDraw has three different styles of COM file, and will
          transparently select the most appropriate to minimize file size.


       PASCAL - Turbo Pascal Compatible Screen Dump

          This operates the same  as the  ASM option  described above, except
          the output  is in  a Turbo  Pascal compatible CONST structure.  See
          Appendix B for the section entitled "Programmers Programming Tips".
          To use the Crunched file format, use the file UNCRUNCH.PAS.


       C - Modern C Formatted Compatible Screen Dump (Turbo C)

          Again, this operates the same as the ASM option.  The format is for
          the new  "modern C" string continuation structure.  The data may be
          uncrunched  using  routines  in  the  two  files  UNCRUN_N.OBJ  and
          UNCRUN_F.OBJ  (for  near  and  far  code models respectfully).  The
          header file UNCRUNCH.H contains instructions on their proper usage.

          We are aware only of TurboC able to handle this  structure.  People
          using other compilers should use the Object file format below.


       OBJECT - Intel Compatible Object Code File

          This  is   a  format  compatible  with  many  high  level  language
          compilers.  Object files  can be  produced with  screen information
          crunched, ascii  only, or  binary normal  (as in ASM format).  Four
          code/data models are supported:

                                 Turbo Pascal v4.0 (and above)
                                 Small Data
                                 Large Data
                                 QuickBasic v4.0 (and above)

          The TP40 format is compatible with Turbo Pascal  v4.0 through v6.0.
          Data  saved  to  these  files  is  referenced by external procedure
          calls and  pointers.    Refer  to  the  topics  "TURBO  PASCAL v4.0
          through  v5.5"  and  "TURBO  PASCAL VERSION 6.0" in the Programmers
          Programming Tips section for examples.





       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              59       




          The QB40 format is for use  with QuickBasic  v4.0 and  higher.  The
          image data  saved to these files are referenced by provided display
          routines.  The  object  files  are  linkable  (if  you  use  the BC
          compiler),  or  can  be  incorporated  into a Quick Library for use
          within the  QuickBasic environment.   When  linking separately, you
          must include  the file QBUTIL.LIB in addition to any TheDraw object
          files.  To simplify  matters,  you  can  merge  the  QBUTIL.LIB and
          object files into one library.

          A batch  file MAKEQLB.BAT  is provided  to simplify  the process of
          creating Quick Library and the separate library files.  To use, the
          first parameter  should be the name of the quick library to create.
          The following parameters are TheDraw object files plus other object
          (.OBJ) and library (.LIB) files you want included.  ie:

                MAKEQLB testlib IMAGE1.OBJ IMAGE2.OBJ USERCODE.LIB

          This creates  the files named TESTLIB.LIB and TESTLIB.QLB.  Note no
          file extension was  specified  on  the  "testlib"  parameter above,
          since the  batch file  adds ".LIB"  and ".QLB"  automatically.  The
          Quick Library contains the display routines (from QBUTIL.LIB, which
          is  always  added  by  the  batch  file), plus the screen images in
          IMAGE1.OBJ and IMAGE2.OBJ.  Also included is a library of user code
          you might  optionally want  in this  quick library.   See the topic
          "MICROSOFT  QUICKBASIC   v4.0   AND   v4.5"   in   the  Programmers
          Programming Tips section.


          OBJECT FILE DATA FORMATS
          ------------------------

          The data formats use the following identifiers:

                                 Small Data        Large Data
                                 ----------      ---------------
                     Segment:      _DATA          filename_DATA
                     Group:        DGROUP         filename_DATA

          Where "filename" is the actual filename given the object file.

          The  last  prompt  under  object  files  is  for the data reference
          identifier.  This is the name  you  will  use  in  your  program to
          access the  object data.   It  defaults to  IMAGEDATA (for TP40 and
          QuickBasic) or _IMAGEDATA (Small or Large Data).  The underscore is
          usually  required   for  small   or  large  data  formats,  but  is
          application and compiler dependent.







       TheDraw v4.00         TheDraw Command Functions              60       




          The above identifier is used to  directly reference  the image data
          stored.      In   addition,   TheDraw  generates  three  additional
          identifiers similar to the ASM case:

                                 identifier_WIDTH
                                 identifier_DEPTH
                                 identifier_LENGTH

          For QuickBasic users the following identifiers are used,  called as
          subroutine functions to obtain the wanted value:

                                 identifierWIDTH
                                 identifierDEPTH
                                 identifierLENGTH

          In all  cases, these  contain the dimensions of the block specified
          (width and depth).  The last identifier specifies how long the data
          block is.   The  width/depth values  are useful for drawing windows
          and other related functions.   The  length parameter  is useful for
          displaying crunched images.


       THEDRAW - TheDraw Setup Save

          This  format  saves  everything  about the current configuration of
          TheDraw.  In normal edit mode, all occupied page layers  are saved.
          In animation  mode, the complete animation sequence is stored.  All
          other parameters are saved  also  (ie:  current  colors,  tab line,
          cursor position, current page layer, etc...).

          The TheDraw  format file  also has the benefit of being the fastest
          way to load and retrieve screen images; eight page layers  or 16000
          animation entries take only seconds to load.


       Following the  above prompts,  TheDraw prompts for a filename.  If the
       file already exists, you are prompted to verify the save.   If  you do
       not specify a filename extension, TheDraw assumes the following:

                          .ANS     ANSI compatible files
                          .ASC     ASCII text files
                          .ASM     Assembler files
                          .BIN     Binary dumps
                          .BSV     Bsave files 
                          .COM     COM files
                          .PAS     Pascal files
                          .H       C files
                          .OBJ     Object files
                          .TD      TheDraw format files.

       A file  without an  extension can  be specified by placing a period as
       the last character of the filename (ie: TESTFILE. ).  After entry of a
       valid filename, the screen is saved to disk.

       For information  and suggestions  on using the screen files created by
       TheDraw see Appendix B (Programmers Programming Tips).  



                                 ALT-T: TAB SETUP

       This command allows you to set tabs in the editor (positions where the
       [TAB] key  stops).  Initially the positions are at every tenth column.
       Available sub-commands are:

          SET       - Set a new tab position.  Move the cursor to  the wanted
                      position then press 'S'.
          CLEAR     - Clears tab at current cursor position
          RESET     - Resets tab line to initial settings (every ten spaces).
          ERASE     - Delete all current tab setting for a clean slate.
          INCREMENT - Prompts  for  a  step  size.    From the current cursor
                      position, every nth location is then set.   This allows
                      you to  quickly specify,  say every  fourth position if
                      your need requires it.

       Press [ESC] to leave the tab set command.



                          ALT-U: USE COLORS UNDER CURSOR

       Changes current edit colors (seen on  status line)  to those currently
       under the  cursor.   This provides  a fast  method to change to colors
       already displayed on the screen.



                               ALT-V: VIEW A SCREEN

       This command allows you to look at an image saved on disk.  Nothing is
       altered by  this command.   This might be used in conjunction with the
       block load/import function (see ALT-B).  

       Viewing a screen is similar to loading (see  ALT-L) except  the loaded
       image is  not remembered.  Once the image is fully displayed, a window
       appears  with  instructions.      Press  [ENTER]  to  exit  view mode.
       Pressing any  other key  will make  the window disappear to facilitate
       viewing.  After about 30 seconds  the window  reappears to  remind you
       about view mode (in case you leave the computer unattended).

                               ALT-W: EDIT CHARACTER
                        (available in animation mode only)

       Allows the editing of a mistyped animation entry.  This command exists
       because simply overwriting an incorrect character does not  delete it.
       In  animation  mode,  both  entries  are  remembered  -  the incorrect
       character, plus the  wanted  one.    Upon  redisplaying  the animation
       sequence (see  ALT-Q), both  characters would  be seen (the former for
       only a millisecond perhaps, but it would appear).

       Another way is using ALT-Z to delete the incorrect entry.   The wanted
       character could then be typed in.  This works perfectly well, and some
       people may prefer it;  however, to  quickly change  an entry  ALT-W is
       more convenient.

       After pressing  Alt-W you are prompted to type the new character.  The
       current position  will  flicker.    All  color  changing  commands are
       available (ALT-A and the Ctrl-Arrow keys) while editing.




                                ALT-X: EXIT THEDRAW

       Prompts  if  you  wish  to  exit  TheDraw  or  execute a shell to DOS.
       Responding Yes exits the program.  No cancels the command.  

       Shell also exits to Dos,  however  TheDraw  remains  in  memory.   All
       screen page  layers and  animation entries  are retained.   To free up
       memory for the Dos Shell, TheDraw will try temporarily saving its data
       to  expanded  memory/EMS  or  a  disk  swap  file (if insufficient EMS
       exists).  Typing the command "EXIT"  at  the  Dos  prompt  will return
       control to TheDraw.



                            ALT-Y: DELETE CURRENT LINE

       Deletes the  current line  on the screen.  All lines below are shifted
       up one line position.  The bottom line is cleared using spaces and the
       default background  color.   This command is not reversible, so use it
       carefully.

                           ALT-Z: ERASE CURSOR CHARACTER
                        (available in animation mode only)

       Erases the top-most  character  from  the  animation  sequence  at the
       current cursor  position.  Only the last character typed at the cursor
       position is deleted, everything typed before is unchanged.  

       This differs from the Backspace  key  which  deletes  everything  at a
       cursor position.



                         ALT-[left]: DELETE CURRENT COLUMN

       Deletes the  current column on the screen.  Everything to the right of
       the current column is shift over one position.  The  right-most column
       is  cleared  using  spaces  and  the  default  background color.  This
       command is equivalent to using Block  Delete (ALT-B,D)  on the current
       column.  In any case, the action is not reversible so use carefully.




                           ALT-[right]: INSERT A COLUMN

       Inserts a  column at the current position.  The current column and all
       those to its right are shifted over.   The right-most  column is lost.
       This command is not reversible, so use with care.




                           ALT-- TOGGLE COLOR DRAW MODE

       Toggles  color  attribute  drawing.    In this mode, moving the cursor
       updates the new character position to the current  edit colors.   This
       permits  easy  manual  color  painting  of a given area.  In animation
       mode, only those locations with characters  in the  animation sequence
       will be altered.  Unused locations will not be affected.

       Operation of  TheDraw is  not changed by this mode.  Moving the cursor
       will simply change colors.

                           ALT-= TOGGLE MACRO LEARN MODE
                             (registered version only)

       Activates the macro learning mode of TheDrawR.   You are  prompted for
       which macro key to program (0-9).  After specifying the macro, TheDraw
       remembers everything  you type.   This  is somewhat  akin to animation
       mode; however,  macro learn  mode literally remembers everything.  All
       editing commands performed, any  characters typed,  etc...   Up to 512
       characters will be recorded.

       Once satisfied  with the  macro, type  ALT-= again to save it.  To use
       the macro, press ALT  followed by  the proper  number key  0 through 9
       (do not use the numbers on the keypad).

       While  programming  a  macro,  selecting  another macro chains the two
       together.   Chaining  a macro  in this  fashion permits  you to create
       longer macros  than available  otherwise.  When you specify the second
       macro, the one being programmed is saved and learn mode is turned off.

       To program the second macro (and continue the  sequence), select Alt-=
       from command mode again. 

       You can  create an  "endless" macro quite easily.  Simply have a macro
       call itself.  For instance, if programming macro 0, type ALT-0.  ie:

                ALT-= 0 [Enter]         Start programming macro 0.
                <macro contents>Alt-0

       TheDraw would repeat the macro contents until ESC was pressed.




                          ALTERNATE COLOR CHANGE OPTIONS

       For the experienced user,  TheDraw provides  a more  convenient way of
       adjusting the current status line colors.

       Pressing Ctrl-Up increments the current foreground color number (found
       in ALT-A) and Ctrl-Down decrements it.  These two key  combinations do
       not always  work reliably  on all  computers (a Bios flaw exists).  To
       get around this, TheDraw incorporates  a  special  keyboard  driver to
       handle these  two keys.   If  they do not work on your machine run the
       SETUP utility and use "Keyboard  Customize"  to  configure  TheDraw to
       your keyboard.

       Pressing  Ctrl-Right  increments  the current background color number;
       Ctrl-Left decrements it.

                        SHIFT-SPACE: SOLID SPACE CHARACTER

       As stated elsewhere in this documentation (see ALT-E), the sprite mode
       of TheDraw  makes lower  page layers  appear through "black spaces" on
       the  current  page  layer.    This  can  sometimes  be  convenient and
       sometimes  not.    There  are  instances  when you want to have a non-
       transparent black space on the screen.

       The Solid Space performs this function  (non-transparent black space).
       Moving the  cursor onto  a solid space will cause the background color
       to flicker as an  indicator.   A Solid  space is  nothing more  than a
       character #255 (which is a blank IBM extended character).




                        CTRL-PRTSC: FULL SCREEN MODE TOGGLE

       This  command  toggles  screen  usage  in  TheDraw  between  23  lines
       (regular) and 25 lines (full-screen).  In full-Screen  mode the status
       line disappears  so you  can fully use the screen.  TheDraw also makes
       heavy use of pop  up windows  for prompts  and messages  in this mode.
       While useful,  it can be awkward since YOU must remember where you are
       at all times.  For instance, block marking and etc...   It  is easy to
       become confused  unless you are careful.  If all else fails, hit ESC a
       few times to abort the current command.   Some people  may prefer this
       mode which  is fine.  Nothing forces you to use either screen size for
       anything.  

       Ctrl-PrtSc only operates from command mode.  It is not available under
       any  sub  commands  (such  as  Block,  Global,  etc...).  There are no
       restrictions on full screen use in animation modes.

                               THE ANIMATION SYSTEM
                               ____________________


       WHAT IS ANSI ANIMATION?
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The animation system of TheDraw allows the user to create screens with
       movement, adding excitement to your presentations.  In animation mode,
       TheDraw  basically  remembers  the  exact  order  in  which  you enter
       something.  This involves what you type, and more significantly, where
       you typed it.  For comparison, TheDraw normally  saves a  static image
       from the  Top to  Bottom of  the screen  -- just like any typical text
       file would be displayed.

       Animation or sequencing allows a  screen  to  be  displayed  bottom to
       top, totally  against the  natural order  of things  (so far as Dos is
       concerned anyway).  With the animation sequence you  put characters in
       exact locations  in any order you want.  Those keystrokes are repeated
       in the same order when played back.  For example typing the  numbers 0
       through 9 backwards along the screen.  ie:

                         
                                                        
                                                        
                               9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0      
                                                        
                          ( <--- typed this direction ) 
                         

       Upon replay,  the "0"  would appear  first, followed  by the "1", "2",
       etc...  Exactly as was typed.  Note  in this  example movement  of the
       cursor was not stored, although it could be.  Storing cursor movements
       will be discussed later.

       Animation sequences can be saved in two different formats: ANSI (.ANS)
       and THEDRAW  (.TD).   A sequence  saved in Ansi can be displayed using
       the  Dos  TYPE  command  on  any  computer  with  the  ANSI.SYS driver
       installed (see  Appendix A on how to install it).  Ansi files are also
       used widely on bulletin board  systems.    TheDraw  is  not  needed to
       display Ansi files once created.  

       The THEDRAW  format is  used for  quickly saving and loading animation
       sequences to disk.  The Presentation  Program (THEPP)  can be  used to
       display an animation sequence saved in TheDraw format.

       For an  example of  Ansi Animation, enter "TYPE SHUTTLE2.ANS" from the
       Dos prompt (once the ANSI.SYS driver is installed).

       ANIMATION BASICS
       ______________________________________________________________________

       TheDraw never physically "moves"  anything  when  animating something.
       This is  an illusion created by careful placement of characters (which
       as you remember can be placed anywhere we want).  The "animation" of a
       display is done manually; moving objects step by step. 

       The  illusion  of  movement  is  simple  to describe:  Draw an object.
       Erase it, then redraw it moved over slightly.  Repeat  the above.   If
       done  properly,  the  object  will  appear to move.  Nothing is really
       "moving" per say, we are just simulating it.

       For an example, imagine an asterisk in the center of  the screen.   We
       wish to  have this  asterisk move  to the right.  To do this, first we
       put a space over the existing asterisk (thus erasing it), then display
       a new  asterisk over to the right (redrawing it).  Repeating this will
       "animate" the asterisk, since it appears to move.  ie:
                        
          
             *          Asterisk as it initially was drawn.
          
          
             _          Asterisk has been erased
          
          
             _*         A new asterisk has been drawn shifted over.
          
          
             __*        Above two steps repeated.
          

       Do the above process quickly, and  the user  effectively sees movement
       because the  eye smoothly  connects the old asterisk position with the
       new one for us.


       A SIMPLE EXAMPLE
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The easiest animation example under TheDraw to play  with is  a snake.
       Our snake,  we'll call  him Slither from now on, will be a simple life
       form, growing each time  he is  moved.   In effect,  Slither's tail is
       never shifted since he grows so rapidly.  To create this peculiar life
       form, enter animation mode (ALT-J,T).  Next, turn on line drawing mode
       (ALT-M; "Draw" appears on status line).

       To give  arise to Slither, move the cursor using the arrow keys.  Keep
       moving in the same direction and low and behold there  he is.   Change
       direction, and move for a while.   Make Slither do as many twists and
       turns as you like, since he really enjoys a good run (or crawl?)

                            *                     
                         (start)                  
                     

       Now for  the moment of truth.  Make Slither repeat what he just did by
       using animation redraw (ALT-Q).  Enter a delay of about  100, then sit
       back and watch Slither perform for you exactly as he did before.

       Hopefully this example shows just how little effort it takes to
       produce simple animation.  Even this uncomplicated approach will add
       the extra pizzazz a presentation needs.  Possibilities include drawing
       charts, graphs,  outline figures,  backdrops, etc...  Your imagination
       is the only limiting factor.

       The next section describes how to move objects (such as the asterisk
       example shown previously).



       HOW TO ANIMATE SOMETHING
       ______________________________________________________________________

       The asterisk  example  showed  the  classic  method  for  moving small
       objects.   ie: draw, erase, draw, repeat...   However, the Ansi driver
       under which our animation  special effects  operate is  quite limited.
       The illusion  of movement  is lost with large objects because too much
       time is spent erasing and redrawing them.  A better way is needed.

       For larger  objects, we  can use  the block  copy facility.   Draw the
       object,  and  decide  what  direction  things  will move.  Now, mark a
       block over the object -plus- an extra blank line on  the side opposite
       to the direction of movement.  ie:

       block outline --> 
                          OBJECT--> movement will be this way
                         
                          ^
                           extra blank line





       TheDraw v4.00           The Animation System                 69       




       The complicated  bit follows:  Choose block copy.  Move the block once
       in the direction of movement and Stamp it.  Move it again,  and Stamp.
       Repeat as  much as  desired.  On the last shift, press [ENTER] instead
       of stamp.  That's it!  Now try redrawing with ALT-Q.  You have created
       a moving object.

       This new approach is similar to the asterisk example, but notice we do
       not explicitly erase the object before shifting and redrawing.  A good
       improvement making each shift almost twice as fast!

       Objects are  generally larger  than the distance moved between shifts,
       and afterwards occupy most of the same space as before.  Thus, why you
       may ask,  bother erasing an area if it will immediately be overwritten
       again?  We can avoid wasting time and things will go faster.

                            
                            
                            
                             Object 
                            
                            
                            
                             ^ ^ ^
                              old portion of object, 
                                     "erased" by blank line

       The extra blank  line  erases  what  needs  erasing,  and  the redrawn
       object simply  overwrites the rest.  By using more than one blank line
       (and stepping more than one line between stamps), the movement appears
       to go faster still.

       Notice that  block copy  was used, not block move.  In animation mode,
       the block move relocates animation  entries  in  the  block.   Copying
       leaves the original in place, and -overwrites- it with the moved copy.
       Just like the asterisk example, we  didn't move  it, we  overwrote it.
       See example shown above.

       Block move  physically moves  the object  to the first stamp location.
       If you redraw the  animation sequence,  you would  find no "movement".
       The object is drawn only once, where it was moved over to (at least on
       the first stamp).   Additional stamps  would behave  as expected, only
       the first stamp would not be right.

       TRICKS OF THE TRADE
       ______________________________________________________________________

       Once  the  above  mentioned  animation  skills  are down, certain easy
       special effects will help  liven up  a display.   Care  given to color
       selection,  shading,   and  use   of  shadowing  to  furnish  a  three
       dimensional feel can perform wonders.   Animation is  also improved on
       occasion by pausing the display slightly.


       USE OF COLORS

          Good color  selection is  as important as the display content being
          viewed.  Colors should be high contrast, but not so  as to distract
          the viewer.   For example, Yellow on Cyan go well together, however
          Magenta on Green do not.  Extensive theory exists to  predict which
          color to  use with  what, but  for our  purposes some experimenting
          will suffice.  Simply look for combinations which are easy  to read
          and do not strain the eyes.  Observing other peoples work is a good
          teacher as well.

          Background colors should be used to  your advantage.   For example,
          look closely  at the TheDraw title screen and note how the layering
          was achieved.  Half block characters (such as "" and "") are used
          extensively with  the solid  portion one color and the blank region
          another.  

          Lastly,  flashing  colors  in  combination  with   good  background
          selection  is  an  excellent  visual  device.   For example, select
          flashing red  (color 20)  on a  gray background  (color 7).   Put a
          block character  ("").   Now select  flashing gray (color 23) on a
          red background (color 4).  Put another block character next  to the
          first.   What you  see is  the block colors alternating between red
          and gray, each block  opposite  of  one  another.    Repeating this
          pattern produces a moving effect.  


       SHADING

          Shading  and  shadowing  discussed  below  are both used for adding
          texture and three dimensional quality to a display.  Shading is the
          process of  gradually changing  visual intensity.  This can be done
          using bright colors then  more subdued  colors, or  using different
          characters with different density such as "".

          For  successful  shading,  one  must  be  aware of how things truly
          appear in nature.  Examine a pen sitting on a table carefully.  The
          color  is  not  uniform,  but  rather  is bright in the middle then
          apparently gets darker towards the edges.  The same holds  true for
          any curvature.

          Example of how color changes on a curved object:


                                  brightest here                     

                           darker    darker          
                                                             
                                                               
                 darkest here                      darkest here
                                                             



                                        
                                    
                                  
                                
                                
                                  
                                    
                                        


          The above  character shading  example shows one attempt at matching
          the curvature  example.   You can  obtain more  gradations by using
          high  intensity  and  low  intensity  color  in  combination.   For
          instance, coloring the following blocks as indicated yields
          eight shades of blue:

                                        light       
                                        blue        
                                                   
                               light  blue
                                cyan        


       SHADOWING

          This effect gives the appearance of  an object  throwing a "shadow"
          onto something.   Many  popular programs use shadowing to highlight
          menu or other box structures.  Shadows are  made by  duplicating an
          object shifted down and over slightly, in a darkened color.  ie:

                                
                               
                               
                               
                               
                                

          The most effective shadow colors are the light and dark grays.

       PAUSING

          TheDraw directly  supports two  types of animation pause: timed and
          keyboard.  Unfortunately, there is  no  way  to  implement  a keyed
          response in  an Ansi file.  The keyboard option is operable only if
          TheDraw or THEPP (see following section  in documentation)  is used
          for  displaying  the  animation.   Timed pauses can be approximated
          however, by inserting redundant codes into the Ansi file.

          One application might be slowing down steps of  an animated object.
          The object  is shifted  once, then  a short pause occurs before the
          object is shifted again.  The relative speed difference (ie: object
          redrawn  faster   than  shifting  occurs)  could  help  smooth  the
          animation in some situations.

          Another application of course, is placing  a delay  after a message
          appears.   Whisking something away too quickly might frustrate some
          users.  The SHUTTLE2.ANS example has a couple of delays  used.  Can
          you find them?


       Ideally  from  the  above  you'll  notice  the "tricks" are not really
       tricks at all, but rather easy  skills to  master.   A little practice
       will put you firmly on the right track.



       LIMITATIONS
       ______________________________________________________________________

       You will discover a few limitations of Ansi animation as you progress.
       Large objects tend to "ripple" as they move.  ie:
                            
                              
                                                    <-- ripple effect
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
                             

       Large object also use a significant portion of the available animation
       space.   You will  be amazed how quickly even 16000 entries disappear.
       Objects up to 30 character by 10 lines (30x10) in  size generally work
       with minimal  difficulty.  Faster computers can get away with slightly
       larger blocks.  

       Since only one character point can  change at  any given  time, having
       multiple objects move simultaneously will slow performance.

       As with  everything, experience will tell you what is best for a given
       situation.  Good luck, and enjoy being a qualified TheDraw hacker!

                             THE PRESENTATION PROGRAM
                             ________________________

       The Presentation Program (THEPP) included with  the registered version
       of  TheDraw  is  a  command  line  driven utility intended to simplify
       displays and demonstrations.  It is flexible and  easy to  use.  THEPP
       can display  any file loadable by TheDraw (Ansi, Ascii, Binary, BSave,
       Object and TheDraw formats).  As with TheDraw, the filename extensions
       tell  THEPP  what  format  a  given  file  is saved in.  The following
       extensions are used (but changeable via the SETUP utility):

                              Binary Dump        .BIN
                              Basic BSAVE        .BSV
                              TheDraw COM Files  .COM
                              TheDraw OBJ Files  .OBJ
                              TheDraw Format     .TD

       Any other file is assumed to be either Ansi or Ascii.   TheDraw format
       files store  which page  layer was  being edited.  THEPP displays only
       this page layer.  If sprite mode was turned on, any page  layers below
       the current one will appear also ("under" the current layer).

       THEPP takes  as its  parameters a  list of filenames to display on the
       screen.  This it will do  as fast  and efficiently  as possible unless
       otherwise  stated  (on  other  words,  you  will probably want to slow
       things down a bit).

       The following options may  be  interspersed  anywhere  in  the command
       line, before  between or  after, any filenames.  Options are specified
       by using a slash followed by one of these characters:

          Character       Action

              p           Stops THEPP  the display  of pause  messages on the
                          screen.  Note the pauses are still performed.

              k           Pause for  a key  to be  pressed by  user.  This is
                          useful for placing between  files, so  you can stop
                          to appreciate what is shown.  See also /i command.

              t<num>      Pauses for  <num> number of seconds.  Valid numbers
                          for <num> are 1 to 255 seconds.  ie: 

                                   /t10   (pause for ten seconds)

              s<num>      Animation display speed.  This is a slowdown factor
                          identical to  the value you enter when using ALT-Q.
                          It is used whenever  THEPP displays  a Ansi, Ascii,
                          or  TheDraw  format  file.   ie: s10 slows down the
                          file display equivalent to an ALT-Q value of 10.

                          before displaying a file.  If you wish to clear the
                          screen beforehand use this option.

                          Foreground  colors  may  be   any  of   the  above.
                          Background colors are restricted to the first eight
                          however (Black to LGray).  ie:

                              /aYellow,Cyan  (Yellow on Cyan background)

              "text"      Displays any message or  text  between  the quotes.
                          The  message   MUST  be   terminated  by  a  quote,
                          otherwise THEPP assumes  the  rest  of  the command
                          line is  a message.   This is useful if you wish to
                          display your own "Press any key  to continue" style
                          message, etc...  Use the "m" option described above
                          to position messages anywhere  on  the  screen, and
                          "a" option to select appropriate colors.  ie:

                                          /"Hello World"

                          Prints   message   "Hello  World"  (without  quotes
                          naturally) at cursor position.

              f<filename> Directs  THEPP  to  obtain  more  commands from the
                          specified file.  This command file  simply contains
                          a  list  of  the  above commands.  In addition, the
                          command file may call  upon  another  command file.
                          Once   that   nested   command  file  is  finished,
                          execution returns  to the  following instruction in
                          the first  file.   Up to  ten levels of nesting may
                          be active at once.  ie:

                                           /fCOMMANDS.FIL

                          Use file COMMANDS.FIL as source for next commands.


       If you do not give any parameters, THEPP  will display  an abbreviated
       help screen for convenience.  Examples of THEPP usage and explanations
       are given below:


       THEPP /c/p SHUTTLE2.ANS /m34,25 /aYellow,Black /"Press a key" /k/c

          Clears the  screen, and  turns off  the display  of pause messages.
          The Ansi  text demo file SHUTTLE2.ANS is displayed, followed by the
          message "Press a key" in Yellow approximately in the center  of the
          bottom  line.    THEPP  then  waits  for a key to be pressed before
          clearing the screen and returning to Dos.


       THEPP DEMO.TD /c /m38,12 /"BLIP" /b/p/t10 /m1,20

          Displays the current page layer of DEMO.TD, then immediately clears
          the screen, displays "BLIP" in the middle of the screen, and sounds
          the speaker.  The cursor is then placed at the beginning of line 20
          and THEPP exits.


       THEPP SOMEFILE.ASC

          Displays the contents of the Ascii file SOMEFILE.ASC on the screen.
          Equivalent to using "TYPE SOMEFILE.ASC".

       THEPP /fCOMMAND1.FIL /m1,6 /"All done!"

          Makes THEPP obtain its  next commands  from the  file COMMAND1.FIL.
          This file  simply contains  a list  of command line parameters.  An
          example might be:

             Filename #1:  COMMAND1.FIL
                /m1,1
                /"Command file 1 running - Running command file 2"
                /fCOMMAND2.FIL
                /m1,5
                /"Command file 1 resumed."
                

             Filename #2:  COMMAND2.FIL
                /m1,2
                /"Command file 2 running - Running command file 3"
                /fCOMMAND3.FIL
                /m1,4
                /"Command file 2 resumed."


             Filename #3:  COMMAND3.FIL
                /m1,3
                /"Command file 3 running"

          In this example, command files are nest two levels deep.   In other
          words,  COMMAND1.FIL  calls  COMMAND2.FIL  which calls COMMAND3.FIL
          which then exits back to COMMAND2.FIL which then exits finally back
          to COMMAND1.FIL.   THEPP  allows nesting to go ten (10) levels deep
          for a large amount of complexity.  Running the above  example would
          produce the output:

             Command file 1 running - Running command file 2
             Command file 2 running - Running command file 3
             Command file 3 running
             Command file 2 resumed
             Command file 1 resumed
             All done!

          Note:    Conceivably,  an  semi-endless  loop is possible.  In this
          case, a command file would call itself (ie:  replace /fCOMMAND2.FIL
          with /fCOMMAND1.FIL in the above example).  If this occurred, THEPP
          would open the same command file 10 times  then stop  with an error
          message.

                               SETTING UP CONFIG.SYS


       The ANSI  driver must  be installed  to display  Ansi color images and
       Ansi animation files via the Dos TYPE command.   This  can be  done by
       adding a  'DEVICE=ANSI.SYS' statement to your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you
       do not have a CONFIG.SYS  file,  you  can  create  one  by  typing the
       following in your root directory:

                          COPY CON CONFIG.SYS<enter>
                          DEVICE=ANSI.SYS<enter>
                          ^Z<enter>               ( <-- press CTRL and Z )

       If you have a CONFIG.SYS file, append the sequence with:

                          EDLIN CONFIG.SYS<enter>
                          #I<enter>
                          DEVICE=ANSI.SYS<enter>
                          ^Z<enter>               ( <-- press CTRL and Z )
                          E<enter>

       For this  to work properly, the ANSI.SYS file must also be in the root
       directory of your boot disk or hard drive (whichever is applicable).

       People wanting  to use  a mouse  with TheDraw  may have  to install an
       additional  file  in  their  CONFIG.SYS  file.    If  a driver must be
       installed, follow the above instructions using the name  of your mouse
       driver  (ie:  MSMOUSE.SYS  or  MOUSE.SYS, etc...) instead of ANSI.SYS.
       Additional parameters  may be  required.   Please refer  to the manual
       that came with your mouse for more details.

       There  are  many  other  useful  statements that can be placed in your
       CONFIG.SYS file.  Two which can  dramatically improve  the performance
       of DOS are:

                                     BUFFERS=10
                                     FILES=10

       Add these  as stated  above.   If you created a new CONFIG.SYS for the
       DEVICE=ANSI.SYS clause by COPY CON, then append these using the second
       method.  Enjoy!

                           PROGRAMMERS PROGRAMMING TIPS


       This section is for individuals writing programs who are interested in
       using TheDraw.  Effort was put  forth  to  make  TheDraw  a convenient
       utility.   Registered users  get several ready to use program routines
       (in addition to standard Uncrunch  code).    Routines  supporting Bios
       display, direct  video display with/without snow checking, and several
       screen access routines are included.  Seperate documentation for those
       routines is included for registered users.


       PROGRAMMING IN ASSEMBLER
       ------------------------

       Assembly programmers  will find  ASM formatted  files in standard data
       byte format, using the DB operator.  Asm files can  have varying sizes
       depending  upon  the  save  mode  used  (Ascii/Normal/Crunched).   The
       dimensions and  length of  the save  are displayed  at the  top of all
       assembler dumps.   If  you crunched  the screen,  you will have to use
       the uncrunch  routine  provided  in  ASM  source  code (UNCRUNCH.ASM).
       Values required in the CPU registers are documented in the file.  

       Ascii formatted files must be read as bytes and saved on the screen as
       words.  This can  be  achieved  using  LODSB  and  STOSW instructions.
       LODSB loads  into AL  the character.   You  store into  AH the desired
       screen color attributes.   STOSW then  writes the  two bytes  onto the
       screen.   An alternate method would be to use the Bios or Dos, however
       these methods are considerably slower.  

       A normal 4000 byte dump (80x25 screen) is  the easiest  to display via
       the REP MOVSW instruction.  To display the image, point the ES:DI pair
       to B800:0000 (for color  screens; B000:0000  monochrome) and  DS:SI to
       the screen  in your  program.   Also load  CX with the number of video
       words to display (2000 - A total of 4000 bytes).  ie:

                MOV   AX,0B800h
                MOV   ES,AX
                MOV   DI,0
                MOV   SI,offset ImageData
                MOV   CX,2000
                CLD                          ;Make MOVSW go forward.
                REP   MOVSW

       If writing to a EGA screen (80x43), CX would need 3440.   If to  a VGA
       screen (80x50), CX would need 4000.  




       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      79       




       As shown  above, the  ImageData is  written directly  onto the screen.
       This will cause hashing or "snow" on some  color video  displays.  You
       may want  to move  only one  video word  at a  time, pausing until the
       video hardware is in horizontal or  vertical  retrace.    This  can be
       accomplished with the following routine.

       Example:

          MOV   AX,0B800h
          MOV   ES,AX
          MOV   DI,0
          MOV   SI,offset ImageData
          MOV   CX,2000
          CLD

          MOV   DX,03DAh           ;Save i/o address of CGA status register

       LOOPA:
          LODSW                    ;Read data to be written
          MOV   BX,AX              ;Save for later.

          MOV   AH,9               ;Test mask for Vertical/Horizontal retrace

          IN    AL,DX              ;Read the status register
          TEST  AL,8               ;See if in vertical retrace?
          JNZ   WRITE_IT           ;Jump if so.  No need to wait here.

       LOOPB:
          IN    AL,DX              ;Read the status register
          RCR   AL,1               ;Test bit1.  Make sure we are not in the
          JC    LOOPB              ;middle of a horizontal retrace. 

       LOOPC:
          IN    AL,DX              ;Read the status register
          TEST  AL,AH              ;Wait until in either vertical or
          JZ    LOOPC              ;horizontal retrace.

       WRITE_IT:
          MOV   AX,BX              ;Retrieve the character we loaded before.
          STOSW                    ;Save it.

          LOOP  LOOPA


       The above  is a  fairly complex mess, but will reliably place a screen
       image snow free onto the display.   This  routine is  not needed  on a
       monochrome video since such hardware does not suffer from snow.

       Notice the  entry code  is identical  to the  previous simple example.
       The REP MOVSW is has been replaced with extensive checks  on the video
       hardware however.

       PROGRAMMING IN PASCAL
       ---------------------

       Pascal programmers  have equal  ease with  displaying screens.  Images
       can be flashed to the screen using the Turbo Pascal  "MOVE" procedure.
       A pascal NORMAL save can be displayed with the following program:

         {$I image.pas}
         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;

         begin
           Move (ImageData,Screen,4000);
         end.

       The  above  defines  a  variable  at the absolute address of the video
       memory.  The importance of defining such an array will  become obvious
       below.   IMAGEDATA is assumed to be the name of the pascal image dump,
       but is easily altered  when saving  the file  from TheDraw.   The MOVE
       procedure puts  ImageData onto  the screen.   Please note this is only
       for a full screen.    To  display  a  screen  block  is  slightly more
       difficult.  Our program now becomes:

         {$I image.pas}
         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
             X,Offset : Integer;
         begin
           Offset := ???; {Replace ??? with position to display block}

           for X := 0 to IMAGEDATA_DEPTH-1 do
             Move (ImageData[1+X*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],
                   Screen[X*160+Offset],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
         end.

       The  constants  IMAGEDATA_DEPTH  and IMAGEDATA_WIDTH specify the block
       dimensions of IMAGEDATA, and  are generated  by TheDraw automatically.
       If  you  change  the  name  identifier,  the width and depth names are
       updated also.  The depth is the number of vertical lines in the block.
       Width is  the number  of character  across the  block.   OFFSET is the
       video address you want the block to appear at.  It is computed with: 

                             (column*2)+(row*160)-162

                                Column varies 1..80
                                 Row varies 1..25

       Notice in this example we are using a  loop and  moving one  line at a
       time.   Lines from  ImageData are  placed on the video at OFFSET.  The
       address in ImageData is advanced to the location  of the  next line in
       each loop.   The  video address advances 160 characters each time (the
       byte width of the video display).

       Turbo Pascal v3.0 users also have another interesting option.  You can
       include a .BIN file into a turbo program and then display it using the
       above techniques.  

       The file actually becomes part of your compiled pascal program.   Once
       your program is compiled, you no longer need to have the DEMO.BIN file
       present.
         
         procedure DummyProc; external 'DEMO.BIN';

         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
             X,Depth,Width,Offset : Integer;
             ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType;
         begin
           Depth := ???;    {Replace ???'s with actual block dimensions}
           Width := ???;    {as specified by TheDraw after .BIN save.}
           Offset := ???;   {Replace ??? with position to display block}

           ImageDataPtr := Addr(DummyProc);

           for X := 0 to Depth-1 do
             Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*Width*2],Screen[X*160+Offset],Width*2);
         end.

       In the above program, we create  a pointer  (IMAGEDATAPTR) pointing at
       the address  of DUMMYPROC.   The rest of the program is similar to the
       previous example, except all  occurrences  of  IMAGEDATA  are replaced
       with  IMAGEDATAPTR^.    Also,  since  the  block  dimensions  are  not
       available, you must specify them.

       The up arrow symbol at the end is  very important.   If  you don't use
       it, Turbo  will copy  the -value- of your pointer to the screen.  This
       will generally appear as  garbage.   It can  be fun  playing with this
       concept, you simply must be careful with the pointers.

       Pascal ASCII  saves are  used similar to strings.  Since the ImageData
       arrays created do not have color  attributes, we  cannot directly move
       them to  the video.  The following shows two techniques for displaying
       these images.

         --- Pascal ASCII Save Example 1 ---

         {$I image.pas}
         var X:Integer;
         begin
           ClrScr;
           for X := 1 to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH do Write (ImageData[X]);
         end.




       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      82       




         --- Pascal ASCII Save Example 2 ---

         {$I image.pas}
         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
             X:Integer;
         begin
           ClrScr;
           for X := 1 to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH do
             Screen[X*2-2] := ImageData[X];
         end.  

       The first example is easiest to  understand.    All  we  are  doing is
       displaying each  character in IMAGEDATA on the screen using the pascal
       WRITE function.  This works because the IMAGEDATA block (in this case)
       is 80  characters wide, so there is no need for a WRITELN.  The cursor
       will automatically be bumped down to the next  line.  IMAGEDATA_LENGTH
       is another constant automatically generated by TheDraw.

       The second  example is  similar to  the first, but directly stuffs the
       characters onto the screen.    This  will  be  faster  than  the first
       method.  Notice the Screen[X*2-2].  The multiplication is done because
       each character occupies two bytes of  video memory.   Since  the first
       video address is 0, we add -2 to the offset to keep things aligned.

       To  use  pascal  images  CRUNCHED  by  TheDraw  requires  use  of  the
       UNCRUNCH.PAS file  included  with  the  package.    The  file contains
       details and instruction on using crunched images.


       TURBO PASCAL v4.0 through v5.5 
       ------------------------------

       The above  examples will all work for Turbo Pascal v4.0 to v5.5 users,
       with exception to the external .BIN file example.  The newer compilers
       do not  support the  old format.  Instead you must use TheDraw's Turbo
       Pascal compatible Object (.OBJ) files.

       To use the object file do the following:

         {$L DEMO.OBJ }
         procedure ImageData; external;
         procedure ImageData_Width; external;
         procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
         procedure ImageData_Length; external;

       The procedure name  (ImageData  here)  is  specified  when  making the
       object  file.    All  four  external  procedure  definitions  must  be
       specified (Turbo requires it).   Although  these are  "procedures" you
       MUST NOT  execute them.   They  only contain  image data which must be
       referred to via pointers.  The modified .BIN example follows:


       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      83       




         {$L DEMO.OBJ}
         procedure ImageData; external;
         procedure ImageData_Width; external;
         procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
         procedure ImageData_Length; external;

         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
             X,Offset : Integer;
             ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType;
             ImageDataWidthPtr : ^Integer;
             ImageDataDepthPtr : ^Integer;
             ImageDataLengthPtr : ^Integer;

         begin
           Offset := ???;   {Replace ??? with position to display block}

           ImageDataPtr := @ImageData;
           ImageDataWidthPtr := @ImageData_Width;
           ImageDataDepthPtr := @ImageData_Depth;
           ImageDataLengthPtr := @ImageData_Length;

           for X := 0 to ImageDataDepthPtr^-1 do
             Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*ImageDataWidthPtr^*2],
                   Screen[X*160+Offset],ImageDataWidthPtr^*2);
         end.

       The above is for a generalized block of any dimension.   A  pointer to
       the IMAGEDATA_LENGTH  is initialized  but not  used.   It is there for
       example usage only.  The above program can be simplified  somewhat for
       an entire screen.  ie:

         {$L DEMO.OBJ}
         procedure ImageData; external;         {All of these are needed,}
         procedure ImageData_Width; external;   {otherwise Turbo v4.0-v5.5}
         procedure ImageData_Depth; external;   {get upset.}
         procedure ImageData_Length; external;  

         begin
           Move (pointer(@ImageData)^,ptr($B800,0)^,4000);
         end.

       Note the  usage of  typecasting to eliminate the pointer to ImageData.
       This cleans up the program  appearance  somewhat.    In  addition, the
       value of  4000 could  be replaced  with a pointer to IMAGEDATA_LENGTH.
       However, since this is an  entire  screen  why  bother  initializing a
       pointer.  A full 80 by 25 screen is always 4000 bytes in length.

       TURBO PASCAL VERSION 6.0
       ------------------------

       Everything  shown  thus  far  for  Turbo  Pascal  v4.0  to  v5.5 works
       perfectly well in TP 6.0.  However, the  newest release  allows a more
       relaxed  preinitialized  constant  definitions.  The previous examples
       can be shorten to:

         {$L DEMO.OBJ}
         procedure ImageData; external;
         procedure ImageData_Width; external;
         procedure ImageData_Depth; external;
         procedure ImageData_Length; external;

         type ScreenType = array [0..3999] of Byte;  
         var Screen : ScreenType absolute $B800:0000;
             X,Offset : Integer;

         const
           ImageDataPtr : ^ScreenType = @ImageData;
           ImageDataWidthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Width;
           ImageDataDepthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Depth;
           ImageDataLengthPtr : ^Integer = @ImageData_Length;

         begin
           Offset := ???;   {Replace ??? with position to display block}

           for X := 0 to ImageDataDepthPtr^-1 do
             Move (ImageDataPtr^[1+X*ImageDataWidthPtr^*2],
                   Screen[X*160+Offset],ImageDataWidthPtr^*2);
         end.


       In addition, all the external definitions  for public  identifiers are
       no longer mandatory.   Thus the full screen example reduces to:

         {$L DEMO.OBJ}
         procedure ImageData; external;

         begin
           Move (pointer(@ImageData)^,ptr($B800,0)^,4000);
         end.

       People casually reviewing the literature for v6.0 may note initialized
       data is permitted within object files now.   Although a  definite vast
       improvement, the  data is  still private to the object file.  Assuming
       the  designers  of  Turbo  Pascal  eventually  add  external  variable
       declarations  (similar  to  C),  presumably the Large object file data
       model TheDraw currently supports should be compatible.   Until then we
       must bear with the current approach for accessing image data.



       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      85       




       PROGRAMMING IN C
       ----------------

       C  programmers  have  support  similar  to  that  for pascal.  TheDraw
       creates the Normal, Ascii,  and Crunched  file formats  using modern C
       code definitions.  The ImageData arrays are used similar to the pascal
       case.  Please note, in the following examples  it will  be assumed the
       programs are compiled in a state supporting 32-bit data pointers.

       A C NORMAL save is the easiest to display.  For instance:
        
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <mem.h> 
         #include "image.h"
         main ()  { 
           /* Kludge a pointer at video memory (segment 0xB800, offset 0) */ 
           void far *screen = (void far *) 0xB8000000; 
           memcpy (screen,IMAGEDATA,4000);    /* Move image to screen */ 
         }

       The  <mem.h>  file  reference  contains  the  definition of the memcpy
       routine.  Users of Microsoft C  should reference  the <memory.h> file.
       IMAGE.H is  assumed to  contain the array IMAGEDATA created by TheDraw
       (the name may be changed to anything else  naturally).   The void data
       type used is a modern C convention.  If your compiler does not support
       it, use type char instead (or  whatever type  your compiler  wants for
       parameters to memcpy).  

       Reminder:
          Be absolutely sure you are using the proper code/data model.  It is
          very easy to write  the above  program, only  to have  the compiler
          complain about incompatible pointer sizes and other nastiness.  The
          function memcpy MUST accept full 32 bit data  pointers.   In TurboC
          for instance, you must use memory models Compact, Large, or Huge.

       The above  is for  a full screen image.  To display a block involves a
       little more work, as in the pascal example.

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <mem.h>          
         #include "image.h"
         main () {
           void far *screen;
           int offset = ???;  {Replace ??? with position to display block}
           int x;      
           
           for (x=0; x<IMAGEDATA_DEPTH; x++) {
             (long) screen = 0xB8000000+x*160+offset;
             memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
           }
         }


       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      86       




       As before, the variables  IMAGEDATA_DEPTH and  IMAGEDATA_WIDTH specify
       the block  size saved in IMAGEDATA, and are generated by TheDraw.  The
       depth is the number  of vertical  lines in  the block.   Width  is the
       number  of  characters  across  the  block.  OFFSET contains the video
       address the block is to appear at.  It is computed with: 

                             (column*2)+(row*160)-162

                                Column varies 1..80
                                 Row varies 1..25

       A loop is used in this  example to  move one  line at  a time.   Lines
       from IMAGEDATA  are placed  on the  video at OFFSET.  The address into
       IMAGEDATA is advanced to the location of the  next line  in each loop.
       The  video  address  advances  160  characters for each line (the byte
       width of the video display).

       Programmers with TurboC can  also  use  the  function  puttext.   This
       handles everything  the previous  example did  and is  called with the
       following parameters:

                      XUL    = X coordinate of upper-left corner.
                      YUL    = Y coordinate of upper-left corner.
                      XLR    = X coordinate of lower-right corner.
                      YLR    = Y coordinate of lower-right corner.
                      source = address pointer to data

       Examples of usage are: 

             puttext (1,1,80,25,IMAGEDATA);  
                /* full screen display */

             puttext (1,1,IMAGEDATA_WIDTH,IMAGEDATA_DEPTH,IMAGEDATA);
                /* display block in upper-left corner of screen */

             puttext (81-IMAGEDATA_WIDTH,26-IMAGEDATA_DEPTH,80,25,IMAGEDATA);
                /* display block in lower-right corner of screen */


       In addition to simplifying the code,  this function  can be  used from
       ANY memory model.  You are not restricted to the larger memory models.
       However, remember this function will only work for NORMAL screen saves
       (not Ascii or Crunched).










       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      87       




       The ASCII  format is  a bit easier to use in C than Pascal.  By taking
       advantage of the 0 terminated strings  of C,  we can  display an ASCII
       image by simply doing the following:

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include "image.h"
         main () {
           printf ("%s",IMAGEDATA);
         }

       An alternate technique for displaying ASCII format files is similar to
       the second pascal example (for doing the same thing).  ie: 
         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <mem.h>
         #include "image.h"
         main () {
           void far *screen;

           int x;      
           
           for (x=0; x<4000; x++) {
             (long) screen = 0xB8000000 + x*2;
             memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x],1);
           }
         }

       Characters are copied one at a  time from  the IMAGEDATA  array to the
       video memory.   This  is significantly faster than the printf example,
       since the overhead of going through the operating system is removed.

       To use C images CRUNCHED by TheDraw, you must use  the code  in either
       UNCRUN_N.OBJ or  UNCRUN_F.OBJ (depending if you are using a Small/Near
       or Large/Far code model).   The  file UNCRUNCH.H  contains examples on
       their usage.



       USING OBJECT FILES WITH C
       -------------------------

       C  is  normally  implemented  to smoothly interface with object files.
       There are two steps to using TheDraw object files with C.  

          1) Specify external variables referencing the screen image.
          2) Tell the compiler make/project utility to  link the  wanted file
             with your program.  

       The following example will help show this.





       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      88       




       Notice in  the following  program that  no include  is made.  The file
       containing the image is not C source code.   It  is a  prepared object
       file merely  needing to  be linked.   Therefore,  we tell the compiler
       what to expect via EXTERN definitions.

         #include <stdio.h>
         #include <mem.h>          
         main () {
           extern int IMAGEDATA_WIDTH;
           extern int IMAGEDATA_DEPTH;
           extern int IMAGEDATA_LENGTH;
           extern unsigned char IMAGEDATA [];

           void far *screen;
           int offset = ???;  {Replace ??? with position to display block}
           int x;      
           
           for (x=0; x<IMAGEDATA_DEPTH; x++) {
             (long) screen = 0xB8000000+x*160+offset;
             memcpy (screen,&IMAGEDATA[x*IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2],IMAGEDATA_WIDTH*2);
           }
         }

       Notice  the  image  dimensions  (width,depth,length)  are   stored  as
       variables for  easy reference.  The length parameter is not used here,
       but included to show its availability. 

       The second step is largely dependent on the compiler setup.   You must
       create  or  update  a  make  file to link the necessary TheDraw object
       (.OBJ) file with your program.  If you  use Turbo  C, simply  list the
       file in the project listing.

       PROGRAMMING IN STANDARD BASIC
       -----------------------------

       Basic programmers  are a  little more  limited, not  because they lack
       commands, but lack speed.  Therefore  TheDraw creates  the BSave files
       with all  addressing information  already programmed.  All you have to
       do  is  type  'BLOAD  "filename.BSV"'.      The   screen   segment  is
       automatically set,  so you  don't have  to bother  with DEF SEG=etc...
       However, if you wish to override the display segment default,  try the
       following:  

            DEF SEG=&HB800 : BLOAD"filename.BSV",0

       For monochrome video users, replace the B800 with B000.

       TheDraw allows  partial block saves for basic files.  These files will
       always be 80 characters wide.  This is a limitation of BLOAD  which we
       all  must  live  with.    They  can start and end on any vertical line
       however, so you could load a  full screen  then just  load small block
       images to  update those parts of the screen needing it.  Make sure you
       build the partial-block images in TheDraw in the exact screen location
       you want them to finally appear.  If you save a block starting on line
       5, and ending on line 8 that is where Basic will display it.

       PROGRAMMING IN MICROSOFT QUICKBASIC v4.0 AND v4.5
       -------------------------------------------------

       All the techniques mentioned  for Standard  Basic above  are valid for
       Microsoft's QuickBasic compiler.  However, in QuickBasic v4.0 and v4.5
       additional means are at our disposal.  

       TheDraw produces QuickBasic compatible  object files  (.OBJ) which are
       directly linkable.   Each  TheDraw QuickBasic object file contains the
       screen image data  plus  four  functions  for  referencing  that data.
       These are  shown below  as used  from within  QuickBasic (assuming the
       default identifier of IMAGEDATA):

                          DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATA!
                          DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATAWIDTH%
                          DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATADEPTH%
                          DECLARE FUNCTION IMAGEDATALENGTH%

       Changing the identifier when saving the  object file  alters the above
       accordingly.  ie:  an identifier of TEST would be:

                          DECLARE FUNCTION TEST!
                          DECLARE FUNCTION TESTWIDTH%
                          DECLARE FUNCTION TESTDEPTH%
                          DECLARE FUNCTION TESTLENGTH%

       The  functions  are  used  in  conjunction  with  the QB4UTIL.LIB file
       containing subroutines for displaying  the  screen  image  data.   The
       first  function,  IMAGEDATA  (or  whatever identifier chosen), returns
       information regarding the location of the  data.    It  is  used  as a
       parameter to one of the display subroutines.  ie:

             CALL UNCRUNCH (IMAGEDATA!, 0)            Use whichever is
             CALL ASCIIDISPLAY (IMAGEDATA!, 0)     <- appropriate to the
             CALL NORMALDISPLAY (IMAGEDATA!, 0)       file created by TheDraw

       The next  two functions  return the  width and depth dimensions of the
       screen image block.   For  instance,  a  full  screen  would typically
       return 80  and 25  respectfully (unless  a EGA/VGA  display was in use
       causing the depth to  increase).    These  parameters  are  useful for
       determining window and viewport sizes, computing area, etc...

       The last  function returns  the length  of the  data as stored in your
       program.  A crunched image or a small data block could be quite small.
       A 80x25 normal binary screen image would be 4000 bytes.  

       To  use   TheDraw  object   files  within  the  QuickBasic  integrated
       environment requires the making of  a  Microsoft  Quick  Library.   If
       linking together your program externally, the QB4UTIL.LIB file must be
       included as  it  contains  the  required  Uncrunch,  AsciiDisplay, and
       NormalDisplay routines.


       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      91       




       To  ease  the  use  of  TheDraw  object  files,  a  batch  file called
       MAKEQLB.BAT is included.    The  batch  file  creates  both  the Quick
       Library files  (.QLB extension)  and the  separate library files (.LIB
       extension).  The idea being to put everything in one place.

       Once MAKEQLB has run  successfully,  you  can  use  the  Quick Library
       within the environment.  ie: 

                                QB /L testfile.QLB

       In addition,  linking at  the Dos  prompt is  simplified since all you
       need include is the one file.  ie:

                           LINK program.OBJ+testfile.LIB

              (program.OBJ is assumed created by the BC.EXE compiler)

       MAKEQLB.BAT must  be in  the same  directory as  LINK.EXE, LIB.EXE and
       BRUN40.LIB or  BRUN45.LIB (depending  on your  version of QuickBasic),
       plus naturally the TheDraw object files.  The parameters to  the batch
       file are:

              MAKEQLB <targetlib> <objectfile1> <objectfile2> etc...

       The <targetlib> is any library filename you want.  Do -not- put a file
       extension on this! (see example below)  The batch adds  the extensions
       .QLB and  .LIB automatically for you.  The <objectfile> parameters are
       the names of object files you created with TheDraw.  

               -------------------- Example run --------------------

                   THEDRAW       
                      ....assume users creates the QB object files
                          IMAGE1.OBJ and IMAGE2.OBJ

                   MAKEQLB IMAGES IMAGE1.OBJ IMAGE2.OBJ
                      ....creates the files IMAGES.QLB & IMAGES.LIB
                          containing the two above object files plus
                          the required display routines.

                   QB /L IMAGES.QLB

               ----------------------------------------------------

       Once the Quick Library is created, using the screen images is a simple
       matter of  calling a  display routine.   The  display routines must be
       declare within  QuickBasic  before  they  can  be  called.    The file
       QB4UTIL.BI lists those declaratations for convenience.  Simply include
       it with the following meta command:

                            REM $INCLUDE: 'QB4UTIL.BI'


       TheDraw v4.00                Appendix B                      92       




       Example  program  using  images  screens.    Assume  two  screens  are
       available with the identifiers IMAGE1 and IMAGE2.  IMAGE1 was crunched
       and IMAGE2 saved as Ascii.

       ------------------

          REM $INCLUDE: 'QB4UTIL.BI'       ' Get display routine declarations

          DECLARE FUNCTION Image1!         ' Important!  Do not neglect
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image1Width%    ' either the "!" or "%" symbols
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image1Depth%    ' on the function declarations.
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image1Length%   

          DECLARE FUNCTION Image2!
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image2Width%      
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image2Depth%      
          DECLARE FUNCTION Image2Length%     

          COLOR 15,0 
          CLS                              ' Clear screen to black
          CALL UNCRUNCH (IMAGE1!,0)        ' Go uncrunch first image.
          WHILE INKEY$="" : WEND           ' Pause until user hits a key

          CLS                                        ' Clear screen again
          CALL ASCIIDISPLAY (IMAGE2!, 5*160 + 40*2)  ' Ascii display second
                                                     ' image.
          WHILE INKEY$="" : WEND
          END

       ------------------

       The second parameter of each display  call is  the video  location the
       image will appear.  The upper left screen corner is offset 0 with each
       line taking 160 bytes (each screen character uses two bytes).  ie:

             line 1 = offset 0
             line 2 = offset 160
             line 3 = offset 320
             line 4 = offset 480
             etc...

       Thus the first call (to Uncrunch)  displays IMAGE1  in the  upper left
       corner.    The  second  call  (to AsciiDisplay) displays IMAGE2 on the
       sixth line down, in  the center  of the  screen (40  characters over).
       The file QB4UTIL.BI contains a complete description of all the display
       routines for you.

       Note in the above  example, everything  available in  a TheDraw object
       file was  declared (the  Image, the width, depth, and data length) for
       example purposes.  In normal use you need  only declare  what you wish
       to take advantage of (naturally).

       PROGRAMMING IN CLIPPER (courtesy of Larry Stewart)
       --------------------------------------------------

       The Clipper(tm) compiler uses the same format as TheDraw's BINARY save
       for it's "SAVE SCREEN to memvar" and SAVESCREEN() functions.  The code
       example that  follows shows how to retrieve a .BIN file and display it
       in your compiled EXE program.

       FUNCTION SHOW_BIN

       * SYNTAX:    SHOWBIN( <name> [, <expN1>, <expN2>, <expN3>, <expN4> ] )
       * PURPOSE:   Display a full or partial screen from a .BIN file
       * ARGUMENTS: <name> contains the name of the .BIN file from TheDraw
       *            If <expN1> through <expN4> are not present, the routine
       *            assumes a full screen display will be restored.
       *            <expN1> is the top row for a partial screen
       *            <expN2> is the left column for the partial screen
       *            <expN3> is the bottom row for the partial screen
       *            <expN4> is the right column for the partial screen

       PARAMETER binfile,t,l,b,r
       PRIVATE m_buffer,m_handle,m_bytes,m_size

       IF ! ("." $ binfile)                  && Does file have an extension?
          binfile = binfile+".BIN"           && No, default to .BIN
       ENDIF

       IF ! FILE(binfile)                    && Does file exist on disk?
          RETURN .F.                         && No, return FAIL value.
       ENDIF

       IF PCOUNT() = 1                       && Any border dimensions passed?
         m_buffer = SPACE(4000)              && If not, assume full screen.
         m_handle = FOPEN(binfile,0)
         m_bytes = FREAD(m_handle,@m_buffer,4000)
         FCLOSE(m_handle)
         IF m_bytes = 4000
           RESTORE SCREEN FROM m_buffer
           RETURN .T.
         ELSE
           RETURN .F.                        && Error if .BIN file did not
         ENDIF                               && contain 4000 bytes.
       ENDIF

       IF PCOUNT() != 5                      && Check for correct number of
         RETURN .F.                          && parameters.
       ENDIF

       m_size = 2*((r-l+1)*(b-t+1))          && Compute  number  of  bytes in
       m_buffer = SPACE(m_size)              && box.  Allocate space for it.
       m_handle = FOPEN(binfile,0)

       m_bytes = FREAD(m_handle,@m_buffer,m_size)
       FCLOSE (m_handle)
       IF m_bytes = m_size
         RESTSCREEN (t,l,b,r,m_buffer)
         RETURN .T.
       ELSE 
         RETURN .F.                          && Error if file not big enough.
       ENDIF

       Please note:   When  you save  a box (binary block save) with TheDraw,
       the screen position and dimensions are not recorded in the  .BIN file.
       The box  may be  restored to  your screen  at any position you choose;
       however, the dimensions of the box -cannot- be  changed.   If you try,
       the box  will appear  distorted or  the above routine will generate an
       error.

       Examples:

          SHOWBIN ("EXAMPLE1")
             Displays the full screen image in the file EXAMPLE1.

          SHOWBIN ("EXAMPLE2",10,20,20,60)
             Displays the 40 by  10  block  in  EXAMPLE2  at  screen position
             (20,10).

                            COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

       In  an  attempt  to  help  users  with  commonplace difficulties, this
       section answers some of the more frequent questions.

       Q:   Why does TheDraw display  garbage when  I load  captures graphics
            screens?

       A:   TheDraw is  not designed  to handle  high resolution graphics per
            say.  TheDraw handles only text images.  It is similar to  a word
            processor in that regard.
       ----
       Q:   How can TheDraw support imbedded Ansi BBS control sequences?

       A:   Previously  users  had  to  resort  to  Animation  Include files,
            however with TheDraw v4.00,  user control  sequences are directly
            supported.  Refer to command ALT-J,User-Seq for more information.
       ----
       Q:   How can  I control  the location of the cursor after an Ansi file
            is displayed?

       A:   The easiest way is to  convert  your  Ansi  screen  to Animation.
            Select the  ALT-J, and  the "Top"  scanner.  The top scanner will
            make your Ansi file  display as  before.   You could  choose some
            other if you like.  Next, move the cursor where you would like to
            appear after the display is finished, and press the [SPACE] bar.

            The space  will  become  the  last  character  displayed  and the
            position where TheDraw leaves the cursor.
       ----
       Q:   How do  I upload Ansi files to another computer (a bulletin board
            system)?

       A:   Ansi files are sent identically to  regular text  messages, using
            your communication  programs Ascii  upload option.   Before doing
            so, be aware some BBS's explicitly do not  support Ansi.   If you
            pass  the  first  hurdle,  note some BBS's feature automatic text
            wrap-around for lines which are too long.   Other's simply refuse
            to accept  more than a maximum line length.  Either of the latter
            cases will disrupt the appearance of your Ansi files.

            To avoid difficulties, find  the  maximum  line  length enterable
            before the above problems occur (generally 70 characters is about
            average).  Next,  when  saving  your  Ansi  files  using TheDraw,
            specify the  number determined  (70 here)  for the maximum output
            line length.  TheDraw will limit lines to that length,  and there
            should be no problems uploading the image.

       Q:   Can I  use images  created with  this software in my own programs
            for public use (or sale)?

       A:   Yes.  There are  absolutely no  restrictions on  work you create.
            You  might  add  a  mention  "Screens  produced  by TheDraw", but
            certainly do not ask for or require it.
       ----
       Q:   How do I draw circles/ovals/etc?

       A:   Smooth circles & ovals  are  not  possible  using  text graphics.
            Approximations  are  possible  by careful selection of characters
            and symbols.  For instance:
                                             
                                           
                                               
                                             
                                               
                                           
                                             
            The above was produced using symbols from function key set #6.

       Q:   I get disk full error messages when I try saving an Ansi  file to
            an empty  diskette.   The file  is large, very close to the 16000
            animation limit.  Is this a bug?

       A:   Seems unlikely a bug  exists.    The  Ansi  produced  is probably
            larger than  your diskette.   Try  splitting it  into two smaller
            chunks.  Although dependant  primarily  on  the  application, the
            largest  Ansi  file  we  know  of TheDraw producing was about 7.9
            million bytes (a test  of  16000  random  entries,  32 char/line,
            ansi pause of 50).  Even larger files might be possible.  
       ----
       Q:   How can I combine two Ansi files together?

       A:   There are  three ways.   Either load them both into TheDraw under
            animation mode (you will be  prompted  if  to  append  the second
            file), or use the Dos COPY command.  ie:

                      COPY FILE1.ANS+FILE2.ANS FILE3.ANS

            The  above  will  create  a  new  file "FILE3.ANS" containing the
            complete contents of FILE1.ANS and FILE2.ANS.

            The last  method involves  using a  50 line  buffer mode, loading
            each target  Ansi file into appropriate portions (an ideal use of
            Block Load), then saving as one file.

       Q:   Why can't I change the video size from 25 lines to 43 or 50 lines
            as the manual suggests?

       A:   You must have an EGA or VGA video card adapter installed in order
            to use these video  modes.    If  you  have  a  EGA/VGA  card and
            TheDraw  is  not  recognizing  your hardware, then please contact
            TheSoft describing the situation.

       Q:   My mouse  will not  go below  line 25  when using  the 43/50 line
            video mode.   I  can use the cursor keys fine, but the mouse gets
            stuck.  What is wrong?

       A:   TheDraw requires a mouse  driver  (ie:  MOUSE.SYS,  MOUSE.COM, or
            similar  variation)  be  installed  which  is compatible with the
            EGA/VGA video card.   Please contact  your mouse  manufacturer or
            check local computer bulletin board systems for an update.

       05/05/86  -  Version 1.01

       Carl Ehmann noticed a glitch in text creation that caused highlighting
       and blinking attributes  changes  to  go  unnoticed.    This  has been
       corrected.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       06/05/86  -  Version 1.02

       Steven Mills  discovered a bug in the file loading routine that caused
       TheDraw to flag valid filenames as invalid.  It has been squashed.
                                                      
       Changed the program to not allow the user to enter a code  #26 or code
       #27 into  a text screen. A code #26 is the Dos end of file marker, and
       entering it means loss of all following text upon displaying  the file
       or reloading  it back  into TheDraw.   A  code #27  is the ANSI driver
       signal  character.  Supposedly  ANSI  ignores  invalid  sequences, but
       allowing  the  code  created  "false"  ANSI codes which caused loading
       problems.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       07/31/86  -  Version 1.03 

       Upon prompting from Carl Ehmann, output line length  limiting has been
       added.   This will  facilitate other  programs which cannot load lines
       conceivably going over 1300 characters (such as RBBS).   Color changes
       can now  be accomplished  using the  Ctrl-Left and Right arrow keys to
       increment the fore and background colors respectively.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       08/15/86  -  Version 1.10  (later changed to v2.00) 

       Changes in a big way.  New features include:
         ANSI Animation, Line Drawing, Ruler, movement of
         blocks UNDER other text and much more!!
         
       Quick color change keys have been expanded to  use the  Ctrl-Up, Down,
       Left, and Right keys in a more logical manner.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       09/13/86  -  Version 2.01

       A few  more enhancements.   Pop-Up help, and macros have been added to
       the new registered version of the program.  Also a few aspects  of the
       animation editor have been sped up.

       Fixed a slight bug which was causing TheDraw to display the wrong Help
       Screen (in registered version).  Also,  the registered  version wasn't
       keeping track of where its overlay was.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       09/27/86 - Version 2.03

       Carl Ehmann noticed yet another glitch (what would I do without him?).
       The Ascii save routine was using ANSI codes  to advance  the cursor to
       the next line.  
       ______________________________________________________________________

       11/28/86 - Version 2.04

       Ray Buti  discovered an  oddity with  the Pascal  screen save.  If you
       used a single quote "'" TheDraw didn't compensate  for it.   Therefore
       when  Turbo  Pascal  compiled  that  screen  it  complained.  Ray also
       noticed that  characters under  #32 were  missing the  "#" required by
       Turbo.  These have both been cured.

       In addition,   the animation load routine has been made more reliable.
       Occasionally movement just involving the  cursor  (no  text)  would be
       lost.   Other improvements  were made  to make  animation screen files
       smaller and display faster.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       03/06/87 - Version 2.10

       Support for monochrome monitors has finally been added.  Don't ask why
       I never  did it  before...   The glitches  Paul Pacter (and many other
       people) found  with IBM  PC Ctrl-Up/Down  keys has  been eliminated. I
       would have  never noticed  that glitch,  so many thanks!  Kent Godding
       made an excellent suggestion for a ansi-file slow down routine.   This
       has  been  added.    Lastly,  a  few  changes were made to the command
       structure to clarify things and many prompts were cleaned up.

       BSave saves fixed to operate properly  for monochrome  monitors.  Ansi
       files now  output <esc>[40m  color sequences  to clear screen to black
       color before doing anything else.  Thanks to Barry Simon  for bringing
       this  oversight  to  my  attention  and  also  suggesting command line
       filespecs.  Some  new  items  were  added,  most  notably  full screen
       editing.   Thank Ray  Buti for  finally bugging  me enough  to add it.
       Also extended options for Asm, Pascal,  and  new  C  storage  modes to
       crunch and  store only  Ascii in addition to the original normal (4000
       byte) mode.  Thanks to Douglas A. Nicklow for suggesting the C storage
       capacity.

       08/22/87 - Version 2.21

       Fixed a  minor glitch  with window  sizes being  slightly off.  Also I
       missed a problem in the registered version.  TheDraw was not using the
       overlay path  entered by the Setup utility when initializing.  So much
       for learning  from mistakes  (ie: it  happened before).   In addition,
       using a  command line  filespec sometimes loaded a Ansi or Ascii image
       with a random background color.  Needless to say, everything  has been
       fixed.
       ______________________________________________________________________

       04/28/88 - Version 3.00

       Many, MANY  changes.   TheDraw totally  rewritten to take advantage of
       Turbo Pascal v4.0.  A new title screen,  dynamic allocation  of screen
       layers and  animation space  (up to 16000 animation entries and 8 page
       layers can now be  used),  multi-layer  Sprite  editing,  dos shelling
       (suggestion from Billy Noto), and a new high-speed TheDraw format data
       file have all been added.    TheDraw  now  incorporates  its  own Ansi
       driver so Ansi/Ascii file loading is much faster.  

       The animation  system has  been greatly  expanded.  Five new animation
       scanners have been added (ANGLE, GATE, PYRAMID, SQUARES,  and WIGGLE).
       Animation markers(R),  "include files",  animation pausing, support of
       animation on multiple page  layers (no  longer restricted  to just one
       page), global  animation screen  copies, and more have all been added.
       Animation sequences can now  be  appended  together.    The registered
       version supports easy animation editing. 

       A couple  of bugs  were fixed.   The pascal saver was leaving spurious
       single entries on the end of lines (yet another discovery  of Ray Buti
       <grin>).   The Ascii Save no longer outputs spaces on the end of every
       line.

       The  Setup  utility  has  been  vastly   overhauled  and   now  allows
       configuring  of  the  TheDraw  edit  screen  colors,  TheDraw keyboard
       commands(R), and many other parameters.  
       ______________________________________________________________________

       09/09/88 - Version 3.10

       Support for the Microsoft Mouse has been added, making cursor movement
       and the marking of blocks easier.  Five additional character sets have
       been added.  These are accessed via CTRL-F(1-5).   With  this revision
       goes a  new function  key screen  (ALT-F).   Finally, a  few bugs were
       eradicated.  Many people reported CTRL-Up/Down keys were  not working.
       They did work, however the status display was not always updated (thus
       causing  the  following  confusion).    TheDraw  now  allows filespecs
       without  extensions  to  be  used  again.    In  addition, the default
       filespec extensions can be changed using  the Setup  utility (Ray Buti
       can now  change .PAS  to anything he likes <grin>).  The Setup utility
       Defaults option now works as advertised.  Finally, the keyboard driver
       for Ctrl-Up/Down  has been changed yet again.  With the last revision,
       a few computers were gained but the PCjr was lost.  
       ______________________________________________________________________

       04/04/89 - Version 3.20

       Pull down menu system has been added to TheDraw.  The program  can now
       be totally  controlled by  use of a mouse.  Various small details that
       escaped detection regarding the mouse were  corrected.   TheDraw has a
       new storage  format --  COM files.  Separate programs useful for batch
       files and the like.  They work with blocks and  (naturally) the entire
       screen.  A few bugs floating around the program have been cured.  When
       attempting a block save, TheDraw would sometimes display  and save the
       wrong screen  portion.   The ALT-U command was not processing blinking
       colors properly -- thanks  to Darin  May for  pointing this  out.  The
       ALT-L file  directory had  a minor problem when there were exactly 124
       items displayed.  You could go down to the next page even though there
       was nothing  on it.   Animation  screen copies  might possibly fail if
       they run out of room.  What the user saw didn't necessarily match what
       TheDraw thought  was there  until everything got redrawn.  The problem
       with CTRL-UP/DOWN simply won't go away.  The driver will  work for 99%
       of  machines,  but  certain  computers  with  non-compatible  keyboard
       hardware will lockup (notably the Tandy  1000A  and  HX).    The SETUP
       utility now has a provision for deactivating the driver completely.

       TheDraw format  files now support block load/save.  A color attributes
       drawing mode has been  added,  access  via  Alt--.    Thanks  to James
       Carroll  for   this  suggestion.    You  can  now  specify  a  default
       directory/wildcard when  using sticky  directory listings.   Thanks to
       Sylvest Adam  for this  suggestion.   TheDraw supports a ten file pick
       list now.  This maintains a  listing of  the last  ten files accessed.
       Simply press the TAB whenever TheDraw prompts for a filespec.  TheDraw
       now generates Intel format compatible object  code files.   Useful for
       linking with Turbo Pascal v4.0 and above, C plus many other high-level
       languages.   The ruler  can now  be made  "sticky".   When active, the
       ruler stays  on the  screen appearing under the current page layer.  A
       few bugs were fixed.  The  problem with  ansi animation  files getting
       confused  when  saved  without  screen  preparation  has  been solved.
       Thanks to Terry Blake for reporting it.  Alt-O now properly allows you
       to  change  drives.    A  minor  glitch  with  animation include files
       dropping characters has been solved.   Finally, the  directory listing
       handles the mouse in a more predictable/controllable manner.  


       03/01/91 - Version 4.00

       A great number of changes, additions, and improvements.  First the bug
       fixes: The uncrunch algorithm was not quite in sync with how TheDraw
       handled flashing  characters. Thanks to Garry Kraemer for pointing it
       out.  Michael Harris discovered it was possible to select a page  0 in
       version 3.30;  an unhealthy  action that  allowed critical areas to be
       overwritten.  Paul Furman noted the  BSAVE file  format was  not quite
       compatible with  Basic, lacking  a termination code sequence.  TheDraw
       now includes them for  completeness.   Carter Downer of Late Night
       BBS (315)592-7300 noted that when trying to save Ansi files with 80
       column Ansi  files produced  by TheDraw were not fully compatible with
       bulletin board systems.  A file size optimization  causing the problem
       was removed.  Other problems included command line filespecs not being
       added to  the  pick  list,  animation  include  files  not  working in
       shareware version,  and the  screen changing to the default color when
       changing page layers with sprite mode off were fixed.

       New features added or  improved are:   EGA/VGA  screen editing support
       (43 or  50 lines respectfully).  Also a virtual screen edit buffer was
       added, allowing screens  up  to  160  characters  by  50  lines  to be
       edited.   Mouse aided  line drawing;  pressing the middle mouse button
       down and moving will draw a line or box for you.   All cursor movement
       keys  now  function  throughout  the  program.   Line drawing mode was
       improved to tolerate bumping into  the  screen  border;  no  longer do
       unwanted T and plus symbols appear.

       Several  new  animation  scanners  have  been  added including Doors*,
       Diamond*, Circle*, Clock*, Checkerboard, and Wiggleout.  Thanks to Guy
       StarBuck for  suggestion the  first four new scanners.  The ability to
       reverse the operation  of  any  animation  scan  (making  the  scan go
       backwards) was  also added.  Thanks to Dorothy Hade for this excellent
       suggestion.  Another new animation feature  is User  Control Sequences
       (R) permitting BBS operators and such to add escape codes specific for
       special features of their  software.   The last  animation improvement
       was  the  ability  to  append  -ANY-  file  format  (except .TD) to an
       animation sequence.  For non-ansi/ascii files, TheDraw requests you to
       select an animation scanner for reading the screen.  

       Block and global character/attribute replace has been added.  Position
       the cursor on the character (or  character contain  color) to replace,
       then  activate  global  or  block  mode.    The  default load filename
       extension can now be changed to something other than ANS.  If  most of
       your  work  entails  binary  or  TheDraw  format files, this will be a
       welcome addition.  An online setup menu was  added to  TheDraw, making
       configuration of the environment much easier.  Go to the Options under
       the pull-down menu system and select Setup.   Two additional  COM file
       formats were  added, with  TheDraw transparently selecting the best of
       the three for a given application.   One  of the  new flavors crunches
       the screen.   If  smaller than  either of  the other two formats it is
       used.  Otherwise, a  version  explicitly  for  full-width  screens was
       added.   An 80x25  image will use under 4096 bytes; perfect for floppy
       disks where wasted cluster space is critical.

       Ascii files can now be forced to have  carriage returns  placed on the
       end  of  each  line.    If  a  line  was  80 characters, TheDraw would
       previously not include the CR/LF sequence.  This  would make  the file
       display  properly  if  typed  from  the  Dos  prompt, but fouled other
       software such as text editors.  A few last things  were added.   These
       were an ALT-key pop-up help screen; pressing and holding ALT for about
       3 seconds displays a brief quick reference display.   TheDraw  can now
       save  backup  files.    If  a  file already exists on disk, it will be
       renamed filename.BAK before saving.   The  ALT-Left/Right key sequence
       delete/insert  columns.    Avoids  have  to mark a block or use global
       screen move, etc...  Automatic screen  blanking  was  added.    If you
       leave the  machine unattended for a period of time, TheDraw will erase
       the display for you (preventing possible burn damage to your monitor).
       It is  variable from  1 minute to 255 minutes or can be shut off.  Dos
       Shell will attempt to  swap out  information to  EMS memory  or a disk
       swap  file  to  increase  available  memory  during the shell.  Lastly
       (whew!), TheDraw can be made to  prompt to  save changes  before exit.
       Either just for the current page, or for all page layers.  Enjoy!
