distribute in the next week's. 

[NuKE], NuKE Members and AZRAEL not responsibility for damages cause
the use of this program. This program is ONLY for test and owe used only
for expert's in low level programing.
The virus maker is consider ILEGAL in some country's. 
Read your statute's before commit errors.. ===>>>> jail.  ok?

The normal mutant virus (MtE,TPE,NeD) are always find for the A.V. products
because the randomic (variants) is very reduced.
In a ASSEMBLER code of 600 bytes the possibility is very little.

Because of this [NuKE] deliver a program for generate virii code 
with much differences each one.

With this program put in problems a various A.V. soft's.

NO more string detectors..
Heuritics is a falsehood!
No more AV!
