    INTRODUCTION

         Greetings, ÿagain.  As with any new program or software package it 
    is always a pain to have to go through and read the documentation, ÿand 
    this will be no exception (that was a joke).  Anyway, these docs should 
    be ÿa little more detailed in nature due to the fact that I am ÿwriting 
    this ÿup on processor #1 ÿon the TMCS network and have PC Pursuit Thief 
    running ÿon processor #2.  ÿFinally, ÿtrue ÿdistributed ÿmulti-tasking!  
    Enough of that. 

         PC ÿPursuit ÿThief ÿushers ÿin ÿa ÿnew ÿera ÿof ÿhacking ÿutility.  
    Currently ÿwe have Code Thief, ÿFuckin' ÿHacker and others for extender 
    hacking, ÿand before PC Pursuit Thief we only had a program called Phry 
    Code Pro written by the Exciter.  ÿWell, ÿbeing that competition proves 
    advantageous ÿto ÿthe ÿcommunity (of course the Code Thief vs. ÿFuckin' 
    Hacker "feature wars" can attest to that), PC Pursuit Thief was born to 
    break somewhat of a monopoly.  ÿAnd besides, ÿPhry Code Pro plans on an 
    extender hacker in future versions, ÿaccording to the documentation for 
    version 4.0, so to each his own.

    STARTING PC PURSUIT THIEF

         There ÿare two ways of starting PC Pursuit Thief from ÿDOS.  ÿÿThe 
    first is by just typing PCPTHIEF<return>.  If you see it in yourself to 
    type "PCPTHIEF<return>" ÿinstead of typing "PCPTHIEF" ÿand then hitting 
    the ÿreturn key, ÿyou have my permission to put your head through ÿyour 
    monitor. 

         The ÿsecond ÿmethod is by adding some command line ÿparamaters ÿto 
    tell PC Pursuit Thief to start hacking in automatic mode at a ÿspecific 
    time, and then to stop at a specific time, or after a certain number of 
    valid PC Pursuit ID's and passwords are found: 

    C>PCPTHIEF 1:00 2:00

         The above command entered at the command line will have PC Pursuit 
    Thief wait until 1:00 ÿam to hack (all times are in 24 hour format) and 
    then hack until 2:00 ÿam, or until 1 valid code is found.  ÿWhat?  ÿYou 
    don't want to stop after 1 valid code, ÿbut think you can snag 2 before 
    2:00?  Well, enter this at the command line: 

    C>PCPTHIEF 1:00 2:00 2
    
         The ÿ2 above is an optional paramater that tells PC Pursuit ÿThief 
    to quit after 2 valid codes (or before 2:00 ÿam, of course) - ÿwhatever 
    comes first.  If you want to strictly quit at 2:00 no matter how many 
    codes are found, enter something like:

    C>PCPTHIEF 1:00 2:00 9999

         Of course you're not going to get 9999 codes in 1 hour, and that's 
    the ÿpoint.  ÿÿRemember ÿthat this number MUST be an integer, ÿÿso ÿthe 
    highest it can go is 32767, ÿso "PCPTHIEF 1:00 2:00 ÿ32767" ÿwould have 
    the ÿsame effect as "PCPTHIEF 1:00 ÿ2:00 ÿ9999" ÿbecause if you're ÿnot 
    going ÿto get 9999 ÿcodes in an hour you certainty aren't going to ÿget 
    32767. 
    
         By the way, ÿeverything in automatic mode is for FLAGGED templates 
    only.  ÿÿIf there are no flagged templates, ÿthen once it starts up ÿat 
    1:00 it will drop right back to the operating system after it tells you 
    that there are none flagged (if you are there of course).  ÿYou get the 
    DOS ÿprompt after PC Pursuit Thief quits, ÿor if you started PC Pursuit 
    Thief from a batch file, then the batch file resumes processing. 

    IF PC PURSUIT THIEF IS RUN IN NORMAL MODE
    
         Ok, ÿÿhere's the title screen (yes, ÿI'm looking at it now on ÿthe 
    other monitor).  ÿI added a little disclaimer, ÿbeing that this utility 
    has the sole function of going after one company only (GTE).  ÿAgain, I 
    stress that the use or misuse of this program is totally up to you.  If 
    you get caught, ÿthat's your responsibility, etc, etc. When I wrote it, 
    I myself didn't break any laws, but then again is there a legal theaory 
    for "kenetic energy", or... forget it. 

         Hit any key to get rid of the title/disclaimer screen.  Now you'll 
    see ÿmy own little "added touch" ÿto the title as the window bounces in 
    and ÿout/rotates (depending on how you view it) ÿand puts ÿthe ÿprogram 
    title in it. 

    THE MENU

         Here ÿwe go.  ÿKind of looks like Code Thief, ÿdoesn't it?  ÿWell, 
    although ÿit only took me three days (with sleep deprevation) ÿto write 
    PC ÿPursuit Thief, ÿno code from Code Thief was used.  ÿI ÿstarted from 
    scratch ÿon everything.  ÿOh, ÿand we're in Turbo Pascal 5.0 ÿnow, ÿÿso 
    things are going to be a little bit faster (I especially like what they 
    did to the screen display speed). 

         We'll ÿgo ÿover all of the things off the main menu one by ÿone...  
    as a matter of fact, ÿit would be best if this documentation is printed 
    out FIRST, ÿthen you follow the following sections along as the program 
    executes. 

    >modem/city configuration

         Select ÿthis.  ÿÿJust use the up and down arrow keys to ÿmove ÿthe 
    highlight ÿbar ÿand space or return to choose the option of ÿD) ÿÿModem 
    Configuration.  You could also hit "D" ÿthen return or space as a quick 
    way of getting the highlight bar there.

         Ok, ÿÿhere ÿwe have all of the neat things that PC ÿPursuit ÿThief 
    needs ÿto ÿknow ÿabout talking to the outside world, ÿÿand ÿTelenet ÿin 
    particular.  ÿÿIn ÿthis ÿsection the up and down arrow ÿkeys ÿmove ÿthe 
    highlight, ÿÿand return or space chooses the option.  ÿThe letters ÿ"A" 
    through ÿ"J" ÿwill take you right to an option with the highlight ÿbar, 
    but ÿnote that it still takes the pressing of return or space to select 
    it. 

         First ÿthing we want to do is tell PC Pursuit Thief ÿwhat ÿComPort 
    our modem is connected to at.  ÿWell, ÿif you have just a COM1: ÿÿmodem 
    then ÿleave ÿit ÿalone, ÿbecause as you can see the ÿdefault ÿis ÿCOM1: 
    (ComPort 1).  ÿIf your modem is on COM2: ÿor COM3: ÿor COM4: ÿthen ÿhit 
    space ÿor ÿreturn when Communications Port is highlighted and then ÿuse 
    the left and right arrow keys to select your ComPort.  ÿHit return when 
    you have the correct one showing on your screen. 

         Now we need the enter the baud rate.  Note that the baud rate will 
    be ÿthe ÿbaud rate of the Telenet Number that we will enter ÿin ÿoption 
    "E", ÿÿso keep this in mind and don't screw it up.  ÿIf your baud ÿrate 
    doesn't match the baud rate of the modem that answers when you dial the 
    number as choosen in option "E", then you screwed up.  The baud rate is 
    choosen ÿjust ÿlike ÿComPort.  ÿHit space or return when Baud ÿRate ÿis 
    highlighted, ÿÿthen use the left and right arrow keys to cycle ÿthrough 
    the available baud rates.  ÿUse return when your selection is what ÿyou 
    want (and don't screw up, by the way). 

         The ÿmodem ÿsetup string is used for just that -- ÿto set ÿup ÿthe 
    modem.  ÿÿThis ÿentry in your configuration has two special ÿcharacters 
    that have special meanings and are interpreted by PC Pursuit Thief ÿand 
    not ÿsent ÿas ÿentered to the modem.  ÿThey are the "|" ÿÿand ÿthe ÿ"~" 
    characters.  ÿThe "|" signifies ascii character 13 (return) and the "~" 
    signifies ÿa 1/4 ÿsecond pause.  ÿNote that in the default a ÿV1 ÿÿcode 
    (verbose ÿon) ÿÿis specified.  ÿMake sure that your modem is always ÿin 
    VERBOSE ÿmode and to keep this V1 ÿhere to make sure it is ÿinitialized 
    into verbose mode. 
    
         Dial command is the command we will use to dial the modem.  ÿÿWhen 
    PC ÿPursuit ÿThief needs to dial Telenet it will send the following ÿto 
    the ÿmodem: ÿ<dialcommand><telenet_number><RETURN>.

         Connect Response is what the modem sends to signal that we are now 
    connected ÿto ÿa ÿremote computer (Telenet).  ÿÿThis ÿall ÿdefaults ÿto 
    "CONNECT" ÿÿwith verbose response codes, ÿas defaulted to in ÿC) ÿÿDial 
    Command.  You shouldn't need to change any of this, ÿit works fine (for 
    me) as is. 

         We already went over what Telenet Number is, ÿso just enter it ÿin 
    and hit return when you're done. 

         Terminal type.  ÿJust leave this at the default of "D1".  ÿThis is 
    what to respond to Telenet with when it prompts for "TERMINAL=".  ÿÿYou 
    shouldn't need to change this, ÿI added this because something inspired 
    me. 

         Telenet ÿCity.  ÿPC Pursuit Thief checks the validity of ÿpassword 
    and ÿuser id guesses by trying to use them to log into a city.  ÿÿEnter 
    here ÿthe default city to try to log into.  ÿThis should be one with ÿa 
    lot of outdial modems available, or is the least congested. 

         City Baud Rate.  ÿThis option is here because there may be more of 
    some groups of modems (by baud rate) ÿin the city you specified.  ÿThis 
    value is changed between 300 Baud, 1200 Baud, and 2400 Baud by pressing 
    return ÿor space when I is highlighted and then choosing with the ÿleft 
    and ÿright ÿarrow keys, ÿthen pressing return to ÿmake ÿyour ÿselection 
    permanent. 
    
         Highlight J) Quit This Section and hit space or return to exit the 
    modem ÿConfiguration and save your newly entered values (if you changed 
    anything... well, ÿyou should have changed at least the Telenet number, 
    I ÿdoubt you'll find Telenet at 000-0000 ÿ(the default value) ÿin ÿyour 
    exchange.  ÿÿNote ÿthat ÿthe ÿESCape ÿkey ÿalso ÿquits ÿthe ÿModem/City 
    configuration section when the highlight is being displayed. 

    >id/password template definition

         This is option B) ÿoff the main menu, ÿso highlight it and ÿchoose 
    it.  ÿHere is where you can change ID and Password templates ÿ(remember 
    CODE ÿTEMPLATES?).  ÿFor our purposes the SAMPLE RECORD is ok now ÿ(and 
    we'll hack on it in a minute) but just a word on what all those strange 
    looking Template characters mean: 

    0 - The number 0
    ! - All numbers from 0 to 1
    @ - All numbers from 0 to 2
    # - All numbers from 0 to 3
    $ - All numbers from 0 to 4
    % - All numbers from 0 to 5
    ^ - All numbers from 0 to 6
    & - All numbers from 0 to 7
    * - All numbers from 0 to 8
    ( - All numbers from 0 to 9
    ) - All letters from A to Z
    - - All letters from A to Z and all numbers from 0 to 9

         The ÿreason ÿfor these strange template characters is ÿbecause ÿit 
    coresponds to the number that is below the character (unshifted) on the 
    keyboard.  For instance, % is all numbers 0 to 5.  And the key is: 

                                +---+
                                | % | <- You get this when you press SHIFT.
                                | 5 |
                                +---+

         It ÿshould be this way on your keyboard as well (it is for all ÿof 
    mine). 

         Short ÿnote is just something to identify the template with.  ÿÿIf 
    you ÿchoose the C) ÿFlag/Unflag IDs By Short Note option off ÿthe ÿmain 
    menu you will flag/unflag by looking only at the short notes.

    (a)dd - hit "A" to append to the template collection and add your own
    
    (e)dit ÿ- hit "E" ÿto edit the current template.  ÿJust use the up ÿand 
    down ÿarrow ÿkeys to move and hit return or space to edit ÿwhat ÿyou're 
    currently pointing to.  ÿFor the Flagged option, to change it you point 
    to ÿit ÿand then hit space or return, ÿthen you use the left and ÿright 
    arrow ÿkeys ÿto ÿchange ÿit.  ÿThen you hit return ÿagain ÿto ÿget ÿthe 
    highlight ÿback.  ÿÿWhen the highlight is displayed you ÿcan ÿhit ÿyour 
    ESCape key to exit editing mode. 

    (d)elete ÿ- ÿhit ÿ"D" ÿto delete the current template.  ÿÿYou ÿwill ÿbe 
    prompted ÿas to weather you are sure or not.  ÿIf you choose "Y", ÿthen 
    the current template is deleted and the template file is "fixed up" ÿto 
    reflect ÿthe ÿchanges.  ÿNote that if there is only one record ÿin ÿthe 
    template file that "D" will have no effect. 

    (f)lag - hit "F" to toggle the flag on the template you are now looking 
    at.  ÿÿThis is just a quick way to flag templates when looking ÿat ÿthe 
    entire ÿtemplate.  ÿÿTo flag templates by short note choose ÿoption ÿC) 
    Flag/Unflag ID's By Short Note off the main menu. 

         When you're at the "Number or Cmd ->" ÿprompt you can also use the 
    left ÿand right arrow keys to page through the template file.  ÿIf ÿyou 
    press the right arrow key at the end of the file you will be brought to 
    the beginning, ÿand if you press the left arrow key at the beginning of 
    the ÿfile ÿyou ÿwill be brought to the end.  ÿTo jump to ÿan ÿimmediate 
    record ÿnumber, ÿÿjust enter that record number at the prompt ÿand ÿhit 
    return.  If that record exists you will jump to it. 

         The ESCape key gets you out of the ID/Password Template Definition 
    section. 

    >flag/unflag ids by short note

         This section is pretty self-explanatory.  You highlight entries on 
    the ÿcurrent ÿpage and hit return or space to toggle the flag on ÿthem.  
    Each ÿpage holds 10 ÿrecords from the template file and you can use the 
    Jump ÿTo Next Page or Jump To Previous Page to get around in the ÿfile.  
    If ÿyou choose Jump To Next Page or Jump To Previous Page and there ÿis 
    no next or previous page then nothing will happen.  You can choose Quit 
    Flagging mode to get out of this and get rid of the window, or just hit 
    ESCape at any time.

    >view valid password file

         All ÿÿvalid ÿÿpasswords ÿthat ÿPC ÿPursuit ÿThief ÿfinds ÿÿgo ÿÿto 
    PCPVALID.LST.  ÿThis is how you can display the file without exiting PC 
    Pursuit Thief.  ÿIf the file is not found, then it will tell you.  ÿYou 
    can ÿpress "D" ÿto delete the file and quit viewing at any time.  ÿÿUse 
    ESCape to quit viewing the file without deleting it, ÿand the ÿSPACEbar 
    to continue viewing the file at pauses. 

    >package credits

         This ÿpops up a window that explains about PC Pursuit Thief, ÿÿand 
    other neat stuff.  ÿHit ESCape to get rid of it, ÿor hit "B" ÿto see ÿa 
    list ÿof some good boards to call.  ÿIf you are a sysop and ÿwant ÿyour 
    board on this list for any future releases, ÿthen drop me a line.  ÿThe 
    ESCape key gets rid of the list of boards, then hit ESCape again to get 
    back to the main screen of PC Pursuit Thief. 

    >commence hacking procedure

         Finally, ÿthis is it... ÿwhere we actually do the actual ÿhacking, 
    actually.  ÿChoose it and we'll hack the SAMPLE RECORD (make sure ÿit's 
    flagged first... ÿchoose C) Flag/Unflag IDs By Short Note and make sure 
    it's flagged - if not, flag it).

         Two ÿscreens ÿpop ÿup in front of you.  ÿThe upper screen ÿis ÿthe 
    "Information ÿWindow" ÿÿ- ÿinformation about what PC Pursuit ÿThief ÿis 
    doing, ÿetc.  The lower screen is the "Communications Window"... ÿinput 
    and output to and from the modem.

         The ÿfirst ÿthing ÿthat ÿwill happen is it will ask ÿyou ÿfor ÿthe 
    starting time to begin hacking at (you will be shown the current system 
    time for reference).  Enter any times in 24 hour format.  For instance, 
    23:00 ÿÿis 11pm.  ÿIf you want to start hacking immediately, ÿthen ÿhit 
    return, thus entering nothing. 

         Next ÿit will ask you for the time to stop the hacking.  ÿThis ÿis 
    also in 24 ÿhour format, of course.  ÿIf you want to keep hacking until 
    the ÿESCape ÿkey is pressed then just hit return here, ÿÿthus ÿentering 
    nothing.  ÿÿIf you choose a quit time then you are given the option ÿof 
    dropping ÿto ÿthe ÿoperating ÿsystem (DOS) ÿafter this ÿtime ÿhas ÿbeen 
    reached.  ÿÿÿIf ÿyou ÿare ÿhacking ÿfrom ÿthe ÿcommand ÿline ÿthen ÿyou 
    automatically are dropped to DOS after this time.
    
         Next ÿit ÿwill want to know how many valids to quit ÿafter.  ÿÿThe 
    default is one.  ÿThis is because all you may ever want or need is just 
    one valid PC Pursuit code.  Hit return if you agree with 1. 

         Now hacking begins.  ÿIf you told PC Pursuit Thief to wait until a 
    certain ÿtime then the program will pause and wait for that time.  ÿYou 
    will be shown the current time and the time it is waiting for.  To quit 
    all-together ÿyou can hit the ESCape key at any time here and this will 
    take you back to the main program menu. 
    
         Now ÿit ÿwill ÿscan for flagged entries and tell you how ÿmany ÿit 
    found.  ÿÿIf there are no entries flagged then it will tell you, ÿÿthen 
    abort ÿback to the menu screen.  ÿThe initialization of the modem ÿwith 
    your modem setup string ÿcomes next.  ÿÿAfter that it will dial Telenet 
    and wait for the string ÿyou specified for PC Pursuit Thief to wait for 
    (usually "CONNECT") that signals that PC Pursuit Thief is now connected 
    to ÿTelenet.  ÿIf PC Pursuit Thief gets NO CARRIER (because all Telenet 
    hunt group modem numbers were busy, ÿpossibly -- ÿor some other reason) 
    then it will re-dial automatically. 
    
         After ÿa couple of seconds PC Pursuit thief will send <CR><CR> ÿif 
    you're on at 300 ÿor 1200 baud or @<CR> ÿif you are on at 2400 ÿbaud to 
    Telenet.  ÿÿThen Telenet will "wake up" ÿand log you in and prompt ÿfor 
    "TERMINAL=" ÿÿwhich ÿwill cause PC Pursuit Thief to ÿrespond ÿwith ÿthe 
    Terminal Type you entered in the modem configuration (usually "D1" ÿfor 
    dumb ÿterminal... ÿthis is fastest because I think the other term types 
    actually have nulls in them on Telenet). 
    
         Hacking ÿbegins at the "@" ÿprompt, ÿof course.  ÿPC Pursuit Thief 
    will ÿguess a ID and Password based on the current template and try ÿto 
    log into the city you selected in ÿthe modem/city configuration section 
    with ÿthe baud rate have choosen.  ÿNote that Telenet doesn't echo ÿthe 
    password part, ÿso PC Pursuit Thief does this for you -- so you can see 
    what the guess is.  Now here's how PC Pursuit Thief works.  ÿIf it gets 
    a ÿCONNECT ÿto ÿthe ÿcity, ÿthen it will log the ÿID ÿand ÿpassword ÿto 
    PCPVALID.LST and hang up on Telenet.  The screen values will be updated 
    in the Information Window to reflect the found ID and password that was 
    valid ÿin the count.  ÿIf it gets INVALID from Telenet then the ID ÿand 
    Password pair was invalid -- ÿand PC Pursuit Thief moves on to ÿanother 
    guess.  ÿÿIf the @ prompt comes back after PC Pursuit Thief ÿtells ÿyou 
    that something was in the improper format, ÿthen PC Pursuit Thief makes 
    another attempt. 
    
         If ÿthe ID and Password pair was valid and you have ÿjust ÿreached 
    the maximum number of valids that you want, ÿthen PC Pursuit Thief will 
    quit ÿhacking (and quit to DOS if you started hacking from the ÿcommand 
    line).  ÿÿPC Pursuit Thief will also quit hacking if you entered a stop 
    time ÿand ÿit ÿis ÿnow ÿpast that time.  ÿIf you ÿchoose ÿQuit ÿTo ÿDOS 
    (automatically ÿchoosen ÿif ÿhacking from the command ÿline) ÿÿthen ÿPC 
    Pursuit ÿThief will now quit to the operating system and throw you ÿthe 
    DOS prompt or resume batch file processing (this could be a timed event 
    from your bulletin board system, for example). 

         Remember, ÿÿwhile ÿhacking ÿis ÿhappening ÿyou ÿcan ÿlook ÿat ÿthe 
    "Information ÿWindow" ÿÿto see what the current template ÿis ÿ(it ÿwill 
    choose a template randomly out of the templates that are flagged).  ÿIf 
    Telenet ÿever hangs up on PC Pursuit Thief, ÿthen PC Pursuit Thief will 
    call ÿback, ÿlog back in again, ÿand resume hacking.  ÿNothing could be 
    easier. 

    CONCLUSION

         That's about it.  ÿEverything else is now up to you, as to how you 
    configure ÿyour ÿtemplates, ÿetc.  ÿLike all Thief utilities ÿI ÿdidn't 
    include information on the service (PC Pursuit) for a reason... ÿif you 
    don't ÿknow what it is or how to use it then you have no reason to hack 
    on it.  ÿIf you do know what it is, ÿyou can find the information on it 
    quickly and easily enough. 

         Hacking ÿPC Pursuit, ÿas I have heard, ÿis a lot harder than ÿjust 
    extender hacking.  ÿBut it is safer.  ÿPC Pursuit Thief might take ÿall 
    night to find a code... then again, no other program could do better or 
    worse.  ÿÿYou ÿtake ÿall responsibility for your use ÿand/or ÿabuse ÿof 
    Telenet.  ÿÿPC ÿPursuit ÿThief was tested on the author's ÿend ÿwith ÿa 
    "Telenet ÿSimulator" ÿÿrunning on another processor, ÿas well ÿas ÿwith 
    extensive outside party beta testing.  The author does not use or abuse 
    the Telenet packet switching data network. 

         Enjoy, and if you know where to reach me, well, ÿyou know where to 
    reach me . . .
