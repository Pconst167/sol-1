Thankyou for taking the time to try PE.

Please freely distribute this package amoungst your friends (or enemies)
This Shareware version of PE.EXE is limited to 8 character messages and only
10 runs of the program before automatically exiting.
Please bear in mind that this software was produced originally to be used
in connection with a communications test set external mod in port, although
I have used it connected to a PM150 PMR radio set with excellent results.
If you intend to connect your com port to a radio set be sure you know what
you are doing, it is too easy to damage your com port and/or radio set.
The diagram below is the barest minimum of connection that you could get away
with. I would suggest a buffer of some sort between the computer and the
radio/test set. i.e. MAX232 ic.

Please bear in mind that there is a limit to what can be drawn using
ASCII characters. If you don't understand basic transistor switching
circuits, then find someone who does.


I do not believe that computer software should carry a price tag any
greater than œ50.00 and if the software companies and writers were to
have a similar belief then they would sell more software and get far less
of it ripped off. (jumps down off soapbox).
This software has a price tag of œ20.00 .
What you get for your money is a version of the program that has all of
the functions working correctly.
Also I will supply any further updates of the software at œ2.00 a go.
Updates will depend on the amount of interest.
To register send œ20.00 to :-
