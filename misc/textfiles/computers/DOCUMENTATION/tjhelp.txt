                   Revised: 10/03/1993

Remote Access v2.0
==================
* Using DOOR.SYS may result in an OVERFLOW error -- try using a
  different caller drop file such as DORINFO1.DEF. This is currently
  being examined!


Keyboard Timeouts
=================
* If you are operating on a 486 computer and getting a "keyboard
  timeout", you will need to set the following environmental variable
  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  NO87=ON

  This will turn off your co-processor and allow the door to function
  properly


Overflow Errors
===============
* Overflows can occur if you are running under DESQview and your tick
  counts are set too low -- try raising the tick counts.

* If you're running Wildcat! v3.9+ and are getting OVERFLOW errors,
  make sure NONE of your security level definitions have the MAXIMUM
  DAILY DOWNLOADS set to more than 32,000 -- anything over that will
  cause an OVERFLOW ERROR in ANY door using DOORFRAME.

Garbled Information on Remote
=============================
* If the door seems to operate fine on the BBS end but the remote
  cannot receive or receives garbled information, check and make sure
  you are passing the correct IRQ to the door (if you are running a
  non standard IRQ).


Graphic Cards (general)
=======================
* ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card - do not use the ANSI.SYS driver that
  came with the card. Use the normal DOS ANSI.SYS for the screens
  to show correctly.

* Trident SVGA Cards - You should have a utility disk with a file
  called TANSI.SYS, use this ansi driver instead of the standard
  ANSI.SYS.


DESQview/X
==========
* Make sure you have the MATH COPROCESSOR flagged ON even if you don't
  have a math coprocessor.


Lockups on certain COM PORTS
============================
* If you're running on a non-standard IRQ, be sure you are passing the
  IRQ on the command line!! Example:  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /5

  Studs! will now run on IRQ 5.


Upgrading to New Versions
=========================
* When you purchase a KEY from T&J Software, that KEY is valid for
  all upgrades also!


Wildcat! BBS's
==============
* If you are running Studs!, Studette!, or Bordello!, you must use the
  caller drop file DOOR.SYS to make sure the callers remaining time is
  passed back to Wildcat!


Spitfire BBS's
==============
* If you're having trouble with the doors dropping carrier on exiting
  back to the BBS, switch to using DOOR.SYS instead of SFDOORS.DAT.
  On some Spitfire configurations this will happen when using
  SFDOORS.DAT.


Using DESQview
==============
* If you're running the doors under DV and you're getting ANSI
  character codes on the local monitor, be sure to load the file
  DVANSI.COM in the main batch file that starts your BBS!


Bulletin PATHS and FILENAMES
============================
* When specifying the bulletin path, be sure to also select a name
  for the bulletin! This could cause lockups when using Bordello,
  Strip Poker, and Video Poker. If you don't want bulletins created,
  simply enter the word NONE for the path and filename.


ERROR Codes (general)
=====================
* ERROR #53 - This error means a file was not found. If this occurs
  right when the door is opened, please check the PATH to the caller
  drop file (i.e. DOOR.SYS), or make sure the caller drop file is
  being created properly!

                            QuickBasic Error codes
                      DoorFrame uses the QB error codes.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2   Syntax Error                       61   Disk full
 5   Ilegal Function Call               62   Input past end of File
 6   Overflow                           63   Bad record number
 7   Out of memory                      64   Bad filename
11   Division by Zero                   67   Too many files
13   type mismatch                      68   Device unavailable
24   Device Timeout                     69   Comm-buffer overflow
25   Device fault                       70   Permission denied
52   Bad filename or number             71   Disk not ready
53   File Not Found                     72   Disk media error
55   File Already open                  74   Rename across disk
57   Device I/O error                   75   Path/File access error
58   File already exists                76   Path not found
59   Bad Record length

     The most common error that you will see is #62.  This is usually caused
by the CFG file not having enough lines.  I have included this list so
that you may be able to fix a problem that occurs with a T&J Software
door.

     Error #75 is usually an incorrect path and/or filename in the CFG
file.
