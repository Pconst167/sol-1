NOTE: VALIDATE version 0.4 is being released so that VALIDATE will
      remain compatible with the /SAVE option of SCAN. The new /SAVE
      option changes the SCAN.EXE file, and the new VALIDATE will be
      able to compensate for the changes, so that the validation results
      before and after the /SAVE switch will be identical.  This in no
      way impairs the validating process.

     VALIDATE is a file-authentication program that may be used to check
other programs for signs of tampering.  VALIDATE uses two discrete methods
to generate Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC's), which are then displayed for
the user to compare against the known value for the program(s) validated.
The known validation data can be published by the author of the program or
be obtained from a trusted information database.  The dual CRC checking
provides a high degree of security.

     To confirm that a program is in its original, untampered state, run
the VALIDATE program on it, record the validation data produced, and
compare it against the record in the online database. If they match, than
it is highly improbable that the program has been modified.

To run VALIDATE, type:

     VALIDATE d:\path\filename.ext

The VALIDATE program will then display the following information:

                   Size:  (#/bytes)
                   Date:  (file creation date)
    File Authentication
         Check Method 1:  (a four digit CRC)
         Check Method 2:  (a four digit CRC)

     The VALIDATE program may be copied and distributed at no charge as
long as it is distributed whole and intact and unmodified in any way,
along with this file.  Please report virus infections and reports of
program tampering to:
