1.	Introduction

PD,  together  with  a  receiver or scanner, allows the off-air decoding of 
POCSAG paging signals at 512, 1200  or  2400  bits/second.  This  makes  it 
extremely useful for the testing of paging transmitters and systems.

Decoding  of  both  numeric and alphanumeric pager data is supported, as is 
the hex dumping of raw POCSAG codewords.

PD runs on an IBM PC or equivalent, anything  from  an  80286  upwards.  It 
requires  512K  of  conventional  memory and a small amount of hard disk or 
floppy. Hard disk is recommended.

PD runs from DOS, running from Windows is not recommended.


2.	Registration

PD  is  freely  distributed  as  a shareware version. This has a timeout of 
about 5 minutes, after which a registration message is  displayed  and  the 
program exits. Also the logging of pager data to disk is disabled. 

To  obtain  a fully functional registered copy of PD send a cheque or money 
order for 20.00 Pounds Sterling to:-

			Peter Baston,
			7 Allerton Close,
			Pen-y-ffordd,
			Chester,
			CH4 0NJ,
			U.K.

When ordering please state if the shareware version of  PD  is  already  in 
use,  and  which version. Please also note that the registered software can 
be sent out by email, if this is required please give your email address.

3.	Installation

In order to install the program copy the following files into a directory
on a hard drive, or onto a floppy:-

	PD.EXE		Pocsag Decoder program
	PD.INI		Configuration file
	PAGERS.INI	List of pager codes (7 digit RIC's) to be logged
	REJECT.INI	List of pager codes to reject
	PD200.TXT	This documentation file
	7100MOD.TXT	Notes on modifying Icom R-7100 to bring out the 
			discriminator output.



4.	Interfacing 


The PD program requires serial POCSAG data to be applied to the CTS pin  of 
one  of  the PC's COM ports. RS232 levels are required, ie at least +/- 3v.  
PD is insensitive to polarity, ie it doesn't matter which way up  mark  and 
space are.


As POCSAG is transmitted as direct FSK of the VHF/UHF carrier the ideal way 
is  to take the data direct from the discriminator, via a data slicer.  The 
following circuit,  however,  has  been  fairly  successful,  taking  audio 
directly from the receiver's speaker output:-


  0.1 uF                    |\ +12v
---||-----------------------|- \|
AF IN    |                  |741 \
----     |                  |    /--------------------- Data Out
    |    \            ------|+ /|  |                    CTS (pin 5/8)
    |    / 100K       |     |/-12v |
    |    \            |            |         GND ------ GND (pin 7/5)
   GND   /            ----/\/\/\---- 
         |            |    100K
         |            \                  N.B. Pin Numbers for com port are
        GND           /                  given as x/y, where x is for a 25
                      \  10K             way, y for a 9 way.
                      /
                      |
                     GND      
		     
The  above circuit is a Schmitt Trigger, having thresholds of about +/- 1v. 
If such a large threshold is not required, eg for a  discriminator  output, 
then  the  level of positive feedback may be reduced by either reducing the 
value of the 10K resistor or by increasing the value of the  100K  feedback 
resistor.

The +/- 12v for the op-amp can be derived from unused signals  on  the  COM 
port (gives more like +/- 10v but works fine !):-


    TxD (2/3) --------------|<-------------------------------------- -12v
                                     |                  |
    RTS (4/7) --------------|<--------       GND        - -
                   |                          |         _ +  10uF
                    --------->|-------        - -       |

5.	Configuration

5.1	PD.INI

The PD.INI file allows the operation of  PD  to  be  configured.  Any  text 
editor can be used to edit this file. The file is divided up into sections, 
headed  by  a  name  in square brackets, eg [general], [functions]. In each 
section are parameters, set to a value with an "=" sign, eg:-

logbeep=100
func1=alpha

In PD.INI, and any of the .INI files, comments may be added by starting the 
line with "#' eg:-

# This is a comment.


5.1.1	General Parameters

These parameters come under the [general] heading. 


5.1.1.1		comport

This allows the COM port used by PD to be set. COM port 1,2,3 or 4 may be 
used, eg:-

comport=2

The default is COM1


5.1.1.2		bitrate

This alows the bitrate of POCSAG data to be set. Allowable options are 512, 
1200, 2400 or auto. If auto is selected then the bit rate is determined by 
PD at the beginning of each transmission. Examples:-

bitrate=1200
bitrate=auto

The default is auto.


5.1.1.3		logbeep

This parameter allows the length of the "beep", sounded when a pager message
is logged, to be set. It's format is:-

logbeep=<number>

eg:-

logbeep=100

Where <number> is the length of the beep in milliseconds. A value of zero
turns off the beeping, this is the default.

5.1.1.4		logging  (Registered Version Only)

This parameter turn on or off logging to a daily log file. It can take the 
value 0 (no logging), or 1 (enable logging). Example:-

logging=1

Daily log files have filenames of the form DD-MM-YY.log, or MM-DD-YY.log if 
U.S. date format is selected. All decoded pages are logged to this file. At 
midnight the daily log file is closed, and a new one opened.

The default is 0, logging off.


5.1.1.5		log_path  (Registered Version Only)

This parameter allows the path for the storage of log files to be set. This 
may be either an absolute path or may be relative to the current directory. 
The path must always end in a "\". Examples:-

# Log files stored in subdirectory "logs" off the current PD directory:
log_path=logs\

# Log files stored at an absolute location:
log_path=C:\logfiles\

Please note that if the directory referenced does not exist then no logging 
will take place.

The default is the current directory.


5.1.1.6		expire  (Registered Version Only)

This parameter allows daily log files to be automatically deleted  after  a 
given  number  of  days. This will occur either when PD is started, or just 
after midnight. The format is

expire=<number of days>

eg:-

# Expire any daily logs over 5 days old:
expire=5

The default is 0 (don't expire).

5.1.1.7		language

This option allows special language features to be enabled. it is currently 
used to enable special "umlaute" characters used in the german language. 
Eg:-

language=german

When this is enabled the following character translation will take place in 
received alphanumeric paging messages:-

Rx Char (decimal) 	Display Char (decimal)		Umlaute

    125				129 			ue Å
    124				148			oe î
    123				132			ae Ñ
    126				225			ss
    93				154			UE ö
    92				153			OE ô
    91				142			AE é
    
The default language is english.


5.1.1.8	accept

This parameter determines whether decoded addresses (RIC's) are allowed to 
contain corrected errors. This can have two values, 0 (don't accept errors) 
or 1 (accept errors). Eg:-

accept=0

The default is 0. This is recommended.


5.1.1.9		date  (Registered Version Only)

This parameter allows the format of the date used when writing to log files 
to be set. Two formats, uk or usa, are allowed, eg:-

# Use U.K. date format:
date=uk

# Use U.S. date format:
date=usa

The U.K. date format is DD/MM/YY, the U.S. date format is MM/DD/YY.

The default is the UK format.

 
5.1.2	Function Codes

These parameters come under the [functions] heading.  Four  parameters  are 
supported  - func0, func1, func2 and func3. These allow the decoding of the 
pager data to be determined  by  the  function  code,  transmitted  in  the 
address codeword. The format for setting these parameters is:-

funcx=<string>

Where <string> is one of:- 

alpha		-	The message will be decoded as alphanumeric ASCII 
			data.

numeric		-	The message will be decoded as BCD numeric data.

raw		-	The message will be dumped in raw form, as hex
			codewords.

auto		-	PD will attempt to decide whether the message is 
			numeric or alphanumeric, and decode accordingly.

reject		-	Any pages having this function code will be 
			rejected.
			

eg:-

func0=raw
func1=auto
func2=auto
func3=alpha

The program defaults to decoding all function codes as "alpha" data.


5.1.3	Colours

These parameters come under the [colours] heading and may each  be  set  to 
one of the following values:-

  BLACK		0
  BLUE		1
  GREEN		2	
  CYAN		3	
  RED		4	
  MAGENTA	5	
  BROWN		6	
  WHITE		7	
  GRAY		8	
  LIGHTBLUE	9	
  LIGHTGREEN	10	
  LIGHTCYAN	11	
  LIGHTRED	12	
  LIGHTMAGENTA	13	
  YELLOW	14	
  BRIGHTWHITE	15

These parameters are in pairs, setting the foreground and background colours 
for a particular screen area:-

status_fore/status_back		Set the colours for the status line at the 
				bottom of the screen.
				
page_fore/page_back		Set the colours for the first line of a 
				received page. This line contains the 
				received RIC, function code, bit rate and 
				decoding format.
				
message_fore/message_back	Set the colours for the message part of a 
				received page. Also sets the colours for 
				the debug display, data with no errors.
				
log_fore/log_back		Set the colours used to display a RIC code 
				that appears in PAGERS.INI.
				
corrected_fore/corrected_back	Set the colours in debug mode for codewords 
				containing bit errors believed to be 
				corrected.
				
errored_for/errored_back	Set the colours in debug mode for codewords 
				containing un-correctable errors.				


5.2	PAGERS.INI

This file contains a list of pager addresses to be logged and is  simply  a 
list  of  7  digit  RIC's.  Each RIC must begin in the first column and any 
characters after the 7th are ignored, and may be used  for  comments.  Also 
lines  beginning  in  "#"  may  be used for comments. RIC codes may contain 
wildcards, using the "?" character. Eg:-

# A few pager numbers....

1234567 Fred's pager
0012345 Joe's pager
111???? Any pager number beginning "111"

This  file  may  contain  up  to  250  addresses.  Every  time one of these 
addresses is encountered it is highlighted on the screen, a beep is sounded 
if configured, and the page is logged to disk with a date/time  stamp.  The 
log  filename  is  <RIC>.LOG,  eg  1234567.LOG. Wildcards are translated to 
underscores in filenames, eg 111____.log.

Please note that a page will be logged by the  first  match  found  in  the 
file.  For example if this file contained 12?????, and then 1234567 further 
down, then pages to RIC 1234567 would go into 12_____.log  and  _not_  into 
1234567.log.  It  is therefore best to put any entries containing wildcards 
towards the bottom of the file so that the individual  entries  will  catch 
them first.

5.3	REJECT.INI

This  file  contains  a  list of pager addresses to be rejected, eg to save 
screen clutter. This file has the same format as PAGERS.INI,  described  in 
5.2 above.



6.	Running the Program


6.1	Starting

PD is run from the DOS prompt by simply typing:-

PD<Enter>

No command line options are supported, if any are given then PD displays 
the message:-

*****************************************************
*** All PD Configuration is now by editing PD.INI ***
***    No Command Line Switches are Supported     ***
*****************************************************


6.2	Supported Keys

The following keys are supported whilst PD is running:-

ESC		Exits the program

F1		Toggles between NORMAL and DEBUG modes

SPACE BAR	Toggles PAUSE mode on and off

N.B. PAUSE mode stops the output of paging messages to the screen. Any 
logging will still carry on and is not affected.

6.3	Status Line

After PD starts up it displays a status line along the bottom of the screen,
with a data area below. The status line is as shown below:-


NORMAL ≥ COM1 ≥ 1200 ≥ REJ ≥ PAUSE ≥ 13-01-96.LOG 280890  ≥ 100.0 ≥ \ 13:50:39    


The items on the status line are described below, from left to right:-

*  NORMAL/DEBUG indicator - shows which mode PD is currently operating in.

*  COM port currently in use.

*  Current POCSAG bit rate.

*  REJ indicator - appears when a pager address matches one listed in
   REJECT.INI

*  RUN/PAUSE indicator - indicates when paused by the space bar.	

*  Filename of current daily log file, and current file size.

*  Indication of receiving efficiency. 100% indicates that all received 
   codewords contain no errors. Any codewords containing errors, whether 
   corrected or not, will drive this figure down.

*  Rotating signal indicator. Appears to rotate when data is being
   received on the correct pin of the COM port. This is no indication of
   good data, just that the levels are correct.

*  The current time from the PC's real time clock.

6.4	Normal Mode

In NORMAL mode, as long as good POCSAG data is being received, lines of
the following form are displayed:-

RIC: <RIC code> FUNC: <func code> RATE: <bit rate> <decoding type> [auto]

Where:-

<RIC code> 	is the 7-digit pager address

<func code>	is the single digit function code 0,1,2 or 3

<bit rate>	is the data rate at which the page was received:
		512, 1200 or 2400

<decoding type>	specifies how the message data is being decoded:

		Tone	-	Tone - only page 		
		Numeric	-	BCD numeric page
		Alpha	-	ASCII alphanumeric page

[auto]		is appended to the line if PD is making an automatic 
		alpha/numeric decision for this function code.

In the case of numeric or alphanumeric pages then another line or lines of 
message data follow.

eg:-

RIC: 1234567 FUNC: 3 RATE: 512 Alpha:
Please call 1234 - 5688
RIC: 0345678 FUNC: 1 RATE: 1200 Tone
RIC: 0000123 FUNC: 2 RATE: 2400 Numeric (auto):
555-123-1212


Before data is displayed in NORMAL mode the address codeword is checked for 
errors.  If the "accept" parameter in PD.INI is set to 0 then this codeword 
must be error free, thus ensuring that the correct RIC is always displayed. 
If "accept" is set to 1 then address codewords will  be  accepted  even  if 
they  had  correctable  errors. This means there is a chance that the wrong 
RIC will be displayed - if a large number of bit errors are present.

Subsequent data codewords are decoded irrespective  of  any  errors.   This 
means  that  some "garbling" of data will occur in the presence of a lot of 
errors. All codewords are, however, error corrected.  This means  that,  in 
the presence of 1 or 2 bit errors, the orignal codeword will be recovered.

6.5	Debug Mode.

In  Debug mode the batches of raw POCSAG codewords are dumped to the screen 
in hex form, eg:-

7A89C197 7A89CI97 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197
7A89C197 7A89C197 14083EE2 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197 7A89C197


Any codewords containing errors will be displayed in different colours,  as 
configured  in PD.INI. By default codewords containing corrected errors are 
displayed as yellow on white  whilst  codewords  containing  un-correctable 
errors are displayed as red on white.

The  debug mode is very useful for setting up, as it gives an indication of 
the number of errors currently being received. The shareware  version  will 
not time out while in debug mode.

Please note that no logging will take place while in debug mode.
