.Introduction
GET-VIP means Getting_Very_Important_Persons_from_Unix-Passwd-Files.
You know the problem as a real internet hacker. You get loads of passwd files.
You have got so many accounts, and most are only crappy users, students and
so one. Okay, you can use many of those accounts to make tracing your hacks
more difficult. But you don't need them - so why crack them?
Interesting users - that's what a real hacker is searching for - and this is
the utility to help you.

.Whats new?
-> Go to the end of this document and look at the history <-

.What are VIPs on the Internet?
A VIP is someone with an greater access level to a system than the normal
user. VIPs are doctors and professors who may have their researchfiles
online. VIPs are persons, who have access to more servers than their home-
server, those are people with the great .rlogin files.
And these are the people with interesting files and messages.

.What does GET-VIP
GET-VIP examine those passwd files and write the VIPs into an output file.
from 2000 accounts this will be 20-50. You see it? You can now concentrate
on hacking these accounts, you save time and time and time and time and ...

.The Commandline Options
To get a onlinehelp, just type get-vip, or get-vip -?, or get-vip ? and so on.

Syntax  : GET-VIP.EXE <passwdfile>
Options : [<outputfile>] [G:<groupfile>] [-G<n>] [{X/x}<searchfile>]
          [-I<login>] [-N<n>}]/[-O] [-C] [-S/s] [-T/t]

Parameters :
<passwdfile>  This is the passwd-file you want to examine for VIPs


Optional Parameters :
<outputfile>   Output file. If not specified, it`s the fileforename with
               the ending .VIP ... if the inputfile has got allready the
               ending .VIP the outputfile will be names VIP.OUT
               Note:now it will be checked if the outputfile exists!
               if yes you've got the choice to overwrite or to append!
               Example : GET-VIP passwd othern.ame

G:<groupfile>  The Groupfile found in /etc, named group. get-vip scans it
               and adds users with interesting groups into the VIP class.
               You must not have this file to run get-vip, but it's better
               for you if you have it ;-)  VERY GOOD if you do that !
               Example : GET-VIP passwd g:group

-G<numbers>    Groupnumbers you wish to include the users from.
               Seperate character is , f.e. -G0,1,2,3 but can use any
               character you want to seperate them EXCEPT space and numbers
               (obviously). Every good hacker should use this possibility
               and not rely on the scanning of the group file from get-vip.
               A human mind can decide better, which group is interesting.
               You CAN put both options together, -G and G:<file> but if you
               use the -G option, why should you do that?
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -G0,1,2,10,66

-X/x<searchfile> This specifies a textfile with a search string in each line
               with up to 10 chars and ending with an carriage return and line
               feed. the first 80 lines of this file will be read in and used :
               These strings will be searched for in the login and the geco
               field of the passwd file. Take a look at the file SEARCH.TXT
               or read some lines below and see what GET-VIP normally searchs
               for. This is very powerful, you can select special user 
               categories for hacking with this! The search for these strings
               are NOT casesentive (what else ...)
               This Option is Case Sensitive !
               The difference between -X and -x : 
               -x uses the search string in the file in ADDITION to the
                  the internal ones.
               -X means that ONLY the search strings from the file will be used
                  not the internal ones !
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -Xtypes.usr

-N<number>     How many users will be additionally added to the outpufile.
               This is useful to get some experienced users. Those experienced
               users are most time on the top of the passwd file. by specifying
               this option you can add some of those ... if you just specify
               N without a number it will get 50 users.
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -N20

-I<login>      Easy. Just looks for this login field in the passwd file and
               puts it into the vip class ...

-T/t           This copies ALL valid accounts from the passwd file. This means
               it cancels ALL other options, it DOESN'T generate a real 
               vip file! it does something like a slim trimmer to the file. 
               Only the -S/s and the -C  options can be used together with
               this option to generate a new passwd file with only the valid
               accounts which've got a shell.
               This Option is Case Sensitive !
               The difference between -T and -t : -t just works as mentioned.
               -T REMOVES all data from the geco, path and shell field !
               the outputfile will be about 50% smaller and can be cracked
               faster, but remember, the data is lost in the outpufile ...
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -T

-S/s           Only choosen accounts with shells are copied to the outputfile.
               Very good, cause often admin accounts point to run-only
               programs, or they are just guest/diabled accounts etc.
               So don't bother with them.
               This Option is Case Sensitive !
               The difference between -S and -s : -s just works as mentioned,
               -S doesn't those checks if the UID is < 100 (those are admin
               special accounts and sometimes point to an interesting program)
               If you use -S it WILL be checked if the password field is valid
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -S

-C             Convert the output file to the DOS Textformat with carriage
               return and linefeed.
               Example : GET-VIP passwd -C

Options mentioned with the `-` sign : you may also use a `/` ...

Examples : (all these examples are valid!)
GET-VIP passwd.ffm passwd.go G:group -n250 -C
GET-VIP hidden.out crack.it -g1,3:4;145 -N50 -S
GET-VIP a b G:group.txt /g27+1
GET-VIP passwd

I recommend : (you must get the /etc/group file for that, if not then just
               leave the G: option away ... )
GET-VIP passwd passwd.vip G:group -S

For the following keywords will be searched in the geco & login field :
WHEEL, DAEMO, UUC, STAFF, WWW, NEWS, PROF, DR, DOC, OPERAT, HACK, CRACK,
ANALY, WISSENSCH, SEARCH, SCIENCE, ADM, BIN, ROOT, SYS, UNIX, INUX, MANAG
It's not casesensitive, for the term "DR" there are also special checks.
As you can see, a user named "radman" in the login field will be VIP cause
there's "ADM" in the name. So check your vip file to make it smaller.



.Conclusion
That's something to help you. Get this and be happy with it.
It is not a great software, which no one can produce - but nobody has done
it before.

Real hackers rely on their brain, not their machines.

.History
Version 1.0· released   24 April 95
        1st public release
Version 1.1· released    1 July  95 (i've got many private projects so no time)
        -S Shell Option added    (<- very important!)
        -N updated to 5000 accounts (from 4000)
        Accounts with groupnumber or accountnumber 0 are automatically added
        Now supports password-aging
        removed two small bug ...
Version 1.2Ê released   1 August 95
        -R Option added (useful!) something like a passwd slim trimmer
        added an option display for -S
        fixed a very small bug (nah not a bug just cosmetics) ;)
Version 1.2thc released   1 October 95
        I hadn't got the time to program more on that project, 'cause i've got
        3 others at the moment, but the work will be continued!
        I only did a small bug fix and some output cosmetics.
        This is so to say a re-release because the groups LORE & DTI joined
        together to the group THC -> The Hacker's Choice    which will be
        the best HP release group until the end of '95 ... with programs
        for every computer type like the fastest Unix Passwd cracker for
        the amiga, Dictionary generators, BB Dialers, Login Hackers etc.
        So look out for that on all the Dist. Sites mentioned in the
        THC.NFO file.
Version 1.5 enhanced Version, released 26 October 95
        I rewrote the source and compiled it with Turbo Pascal 7.0 ...
        Speeded the functions a bit and removed rubbish. The EXE is smaller
        now but has got MORE functions :
            -X/x function added for extra search strings
            -I   function added so that you can add a special account
            -N/n i removed the Upcase variant, was not that practical and
                 it slowed everything down. wasn't that useful either.
            -S/s added special Upcase feature for use with admin spec. accounts
            -T/t new for the Trim Option (it's no longer -R !) - the upcase
                 variant removes any data from geco, path and shell field !
            -O   Option is removed cause the -N option is now not longer
                 standard init. it's better and easier that way.
        I also rewrote the display a bit.
        Now it is checked if the outputfile exists, and if so, if the file
        should be overwritten or the data to be appended !
        and i rmoved another small bug ...
        puh that was enough for one day of programming ;)


.Future
If there is the demand for it i'll put in these options :
 - Amiga Version ?
 - ST Version ?
I can't think of anything else to be out in this program ...
So tell me if ya want these features, or if you want any others ...


Have PHUN!
