Introduction
ออออออออออออ

    The BackInfo/RestInfo package designed to help in recovering a crashed
    hard disks and return them to use in the easiest way.

    The BackInfo  program will create a master  system  diskette (BackInfo
    Diskette)  with all the  needed  information to recover the hard  disk
    crash.

    The RestInfo  program  will  attempt to recover  the  system  with the
    information recorded on the BackInfo diskette.

Validating programs
อออออออออออออออออออ

    To validate that BackInfo and RestInfo programs are intact, please use
    McAfee's VALIDATE utility and compare the results with the ones listed
    here.  If the validation codes mismatch - Don't use the programs and
    get yourself a fresh copy of the package.

                   File Name:  BACKINFO.EXE       RESTINFO.EXE

         File Authentication:

Creating the master system diskette
อออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

    To create the master system diskette you must follow these steps:

    1. Format a new system diskette in drive A: by commanding
       "FORMAT A: /S" at the DOS prompt.

    2. Make sure that your  PATH  statement is set correctly and points to
       the DOS directory where it can find important files.

    3. Place both  BackInfo  and  RestInfo in the same  directory  and run
       "BACKINFO" from the DOS prompt.
       The program will then write all needed information to the diskette.

    4. Place a write  protect  tab  on  the  diskette and put it in a safe
       place.

    The BackInfo  diskette should be re-created every time you change your
    system configuration or after the following events:

        1. Installation of a new hardware.
        2. Low level format of the hard disk.
        3. New DOS version installation.
        4. Changes in the AUTOEXEC.BAT or CONFIG.SYS.
        5. Change in system paths.
        6. Any other case of changing the boot process.

    The  information on the  BackInfo  diskette  contains  the  following:

        1. CMOS information (AT only).
        2. Partition table.
        3. Track 0 of the hard disk.
        4. Boot record.
        5. System files and command processor.
        6. Startup files (AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS).
        7. Device drivers listed in the config.sys file.
        8. System configuration text file.
        9. RestInfo program.
       10. A new AUTOEXEC.BAT file to run RestInfo.

    This  information  may  be  manually  restored, but only by a  trained
    person.   However,  the  RestInfo  program  should  restore  all  this
    information correctly.

Restoring information after a system crash
ออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออ

    In case of a system crash or a hard disk boot failure, you should poll
    out the BackInfo diskette from it's safe place and follow these steps:

    1. Make sore that your PC can boot from drive A.
       If it's an AT computer,  make sure that the  CMOS  configuration is
       correct for drive A.

    2. Place the BackInfo diskette in drive A: and boot your PC.
       The RestInfo  program  will  automatically  start in the  AUTOPILOT
       mode. You'll be prompted if you like to continue in this mode.
       If you don't know nothing  about  recovering a crashed  hard  disk,
       just let restinfo do it's work and answer all questions with 'Y'.

    RestInfo will recover the system step-by-step and will boot the system
    after each step of recovering data.

    RestInfo will always prompt for Y/N if a disk write operation is about
    to accrue. It will never do anything without noting you first.

    After  RestInfo will complete it's  operation, it is most  likely that
    your hard disk is back to it's normal state.


After RestInfo
ออออออออออออออ

    After RestInfo completed it's operation and restored the hard disk
    data, it is your responsibility to check the system to validate it.
    Compare the information in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS to the one
    recorded on your BackInfo diskette.
    Check important device drives like DMDRVR.BIN and copy them from the
    BackInfo diskette, if necessary.

Warnings and Notes
ออออออออออออออออออ

     The BackInfo  system  diskette  should only be used on the system it
      was created on. Never use a BackInfo diskette on other systems.

     If problems  accrued  during the creation of the  BackInfo  diskette
      you should never try to restore from it.

     If BackInfo  reports of files  that were not  copied to the diskette
      do it manually.  If there is not enough  free space in the diskette,
      copy  them to a second  diskette  and  keep  it  with  the  backInfo
      diskette.

     RestInfo is able to successfully  restore a disk in about 95% of the
      cases.  However - almost 100% of cases may be manually  recovered by
      the information in the BackInfo diskette.

     On rare occasions RestInfo may not safely restore the information to
      the  hard  disk.  In these  occasions, it is in you're  judgement to
      decide if to use RestInfo to recover the hard disk.

The safe solution
อออออออออออออออออ
    If you want to play safe and don't want to get into the  statistics of
    RestInfo  failures,  you should  consult a pro about  recovering  your
    disk.

    There are some  companies  that  actually  does data  recovery and can
    recover you disk information easily by using the RestInfo diskette.

    In USA you may  consult the  ONTRACK  data  recovery  company,  and in
    Israel you may consult Chief Data Recovery Company.
