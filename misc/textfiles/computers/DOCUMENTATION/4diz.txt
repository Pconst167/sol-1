1                                                              INTRODUCTION


   Since a few years I've been using, testing and (re)viewing archive 
files. As you all probably know, 4DOS gives us a lot of easy and fast 
extensions to the standard COMMAND.COM (read MS-DOS) features (i.e. 
descriptions which are shown with the DIR commando). So when I first saw 
4DOS, I got addicted at once.
   In the archives (mostly .ZIP and some .ARJ) used to be a short
description of the stored files, FILE_ID.DIZ. Then I ran into a short batch
file from Donald Clancy (and I've seen many variants after that one). This
.BTM-file extracted the FILE_ID.DIZ and pushed it into the 4DOS's 
DESCRIPT.ION file. So when executing the DIR command this short description
was shown. There was only one real problem: the thing was quite slow.
   To be short, after some experimenting I decided to write such a program
(in C). And here it is:

* FILE_ID.DIZ's of every length can be imported
* DESC.SDI's used when FILE_ID.DIZ's not found
* up to 3000 file-descriptions supported in one dir 
* descriptions up to 12 lines (=12*40=480 chars)
  (limited by 4DOS)
* FILE_ID.DIZ's/DESC.SDI's can be converted:
   v truncating lines (take only the first 40 characters of every line)
   v excluding lines with less than /c alphanumericals
   v excluding @X?? codes (used by PCB or so)
   v describing sets of archives (FILE_ID.DIZ is distributed over all files 
     or only the first one is described)
   v maximum lines per file support
   v recurse into subdirectory's
* new option: only files without a description will be converted
* quiet option: less output (to screen)
* different extractor names supported (ARJ.exe and PKUNZIP.exe by default)
* very colorfull output screen: with (nearly) all the information you want
  (option /d)
* handy 4DIZ.INI file
* nice helpscreen

	
	-------------------------------------------------------------------
2                                                              INSTALLATION



FAST installation: (assuming 4DOS is installed )
 1) Put 4DIZ.EXE, 4DHELP.TXT and 4DIZ.INI in a directory.
    I'll assume here you call it C:\4DIZ\, but you may substitute
    this by any directory you'd like.
 2) Add SET 4DIZ_PATH=C:\4DIZ to your AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 3) Do one of the following:
     1) make an alias 4DIZ=C:\4DIZ\4DIZ
       a) by adding "4DIZ C:\4DIZ\4DIZ" to your ALIAS.LST
       b) by adding "ALIAS 4DIZ=C:\4DIZ\4DIZ" to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
     2) add C:\4DIZ to your PATH statement in AUTOEXEC.BAT
 4) Edit 4DIZ.INI and change the options to your needs.
    You should at least change the "prog" settings.
    (The paths of these archivers probably aren't correct.)
 5) Reboot.

Now you've only to type 4DIZ *.* to describe all the files in the 
current directory.

If you like this util, you could use your whole holiday to add 
DESCRIPTIONMAX=480 to your 4DOS.INI and to change the 4DIZ.INI file
to your likings.


	-------------------------------------------------------------------
3                                                             CONFIGURATION

To be short: try all options, see what they do and put the ones you like in
your ALIAS.

Remember: Using the 4DIZ.INI file is much more easier.
	  These options override the options in the 4DIZ.INI file.

Usage: 4DIZ [options] filename ...
  where options is a combination of:
	/q quiet mode (absolutely no text display)
	   gives in combination with /d: no archive info
	/t truncate lines
	/f fill in short lines with blanks
	/s smart describing: only the first one from a serie
	/v very smart describing: the first description is 
	   divided over the whole family
	/n describe ALL files (not just those without any description)
	/e exclude lines with less than /c alphanumerical characters (def. 4)
	   and exclude the "@X**"-codes
	/c followed by the minimum amount of alphanumerical characters
	   in a line
	/m followed by the maximum amount of lines of description per file
	/r recurse into subdirectory's
	/b (blanks) disable space convert to 255 (space is converted to ascii 255
	   because 4dos otherwise wraps the lines at the last space character
	   and not at the 40th character)
	/d colorfull display with lots of useless/usefull information
	/p pause just before returning to DOS with the /d isplay option
	/h or /? this screen
     and filename ... is a list of filenames or wildcards (or both).

     It's possible to use other than the default extraction program.
     (PKUNZIP -- -+ -) -o for .ZIP files) Therefore you MUST change 
     the .INI file options starting with "ext", "prog" and "opt".
     
     There is a limit to the amount of parameters: this program
     checks only the first 127 characters or so.
			     (that's because of this *&#%^$! compiler)
     
     And there's also a limit to the amount of files to describe. When you
     are describing more than 2000 files an (m)allocation error will occur.

     It's possible to use a 4DIZ.INI file. If the file isn't in the current
     path, the environment variable 4DIZ_INI will be used to find it.
     (i.e. SET 4DIZ_PATH=c:\4diz\). 4DIZ.INI can be used in addition
     to the command line options. Command-line options will overwrite the
     options from the INI-file. An example 4DIZ.INI is included in this 
     package. See also the next chapter.

My favourite command-line is: 4diz /t /v /m4 /c5 /d /q *.*
this could be an alias: alias 4d = 4diz /t /v /m4 /c5 /d /q *.*
But it can also be edited in an INI-file.
Another nice try is: 4diz /b /e *.*.
Now I only have to type 4d.....and all the files in my directory 
are described !!!

Changes since last distributed version (v1.7):
    1) extended maximumlines from 12 to 100 (by user request)
    2) bug fixed: extensions with a number other than zero weren't
       detected (i.e. UC2)

v1.6 was not distributed

Changes v1.5:
    1) added "Max Line": a brown line which indicates where the description
       is truncated; no line is displayed when the description is shorter 
       than maxlines lines and when maxlines >= 12
    2) /q /d combination gives now "no archive info"
    3) display bug fixed: after trying to describe a non-archive file
       some text was displayed on the lower half of the screen in stead of 
       the upper half
    4) added 4DIZ.INI file support with much extra options:
       * destination file can be chosen (in stead of descript.ion)
       * description files can be chosen (in stead of or in addition to
	 FILE_ID.DIZ and DESC.SDI)
       * nodescription option: chose the description to add when the program
	 can't find any description
       * added self-define archives: up to 9 archivers support
    5) reversed working of /n option: if /n is used, all files will be 
       described and if /n is omitted only files without a description
       will be described
       I did this because one user forgot to use /n and lost 20 descriptions.
    6) improved /? /d combination (better help)
    7) removed memory allocation bug
    8) changed quiet option: this is really quiet now, but two times slower

Changes since v1.4:
    1) added /b : disable "space to ascii 255 convert" (per request)
    2) added /d : nice colorfull output screen
    3) added /p : pause before leaving display screen 
    4) added DESC.SDI support ( when FILE_ID.DIZ can't be found )
    5) improved "same family" recoginizing with /v and /s
    6) breaking the 100 files barrier ! It's now possible to describe 
       directory's with about 3000 files !
    7) improved truncating options: try /t and /f (and /b)
       /w option removed

v1.3 was not distributed

Changes since v1.2:
    1) finally got .arj multi-volume support right
    2) added environment-variable usage: 
	4DIZ_UNZIP for unzipping program
	4DIZ_UNZIP_OPT for unzipping program options
	4DIZ_ARJ for arj extracting program
	4DIZ_ARJ_OPT for arj extracting program options
       "old" options /z and /a will be removed in the near future
       this fixes the following "bug":
		   a) lower case file_id.diz not found (just upper case)
		      when using case-sensitive archives
    3) added "recurse into subdirectory" option (/r)

v1.1 was not distributed

Changes since v1.0:
    1) better error report
    2) debug mode removed -> less code
    3) bugs fixed: a) with long FILE_ID.DIZ's (near 8K)
		   b) sort function didn't work (for multiple volume)
		   c) /a and /z options didn't work as they should
    4) added /c : minimum amount of characters per line (now default 4)
    5) added /m : maximum amount of lines per file
    6) added /n : only new files
	
Things to do, but which probably will never be implemented:
   1) /l : remove lines with words out of list-file
   2) /c : edit every description
   3) define exit-codes

Known bugs (I'll try to fix them as soon as possible, please mail me
to report these or other bugs) :
   1) sometimes the error: "Null pointer assignment" is displayed along
      with some junk, maybe only when trying to describe all files, but
      only one file doesn't have a description

Author: This util is made by Mathijs de Weerdt.  (Yeah, that's me !)
	I'm born in Holland in 1976. And now I'm studying in Utrecht.
	(That's also in the Netherlands.)
	I'd like to hear what you think of my program. I'll fix all
	bugs (when reported) as soon as possible. Please mail me your
	suggestions etc. I'll be happy to code them and send you the 
	new version.....

My adress (e-mail): mmweerdt@cs.ruu.nl

MAIL ME !

Happy dizcribing !

You can get the newest version from the following URL (this can be accessed
by almost every WWW-client) (preferrably using Netscape): 
   http://huizen.dds.nl/~mmweerdt
It can also be found at Cyber City BBS (see below for more info).
At least every half version (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, etc.) will be uploaded to SimTel. 
So 4DIZ can be ftp'ed at every SimTel mirror. Ask a cyberpunk for your 
nearest SimTel mirror. I'll put it online as "4diz??.zip" with 
??=versionnumber (i.e. 17 for v1.7). So this version can be found under
"4diz17.zip".

			     Another Introduction

	*  4DOS, the outstanding COMMAND.COM replacement created by
	   J.P. Software, allows a file description of up to 512
	   characters to be created.  The 4DOS file commands such as
	   copy, move and delete cause the description to follow the
	   file.  In other words, if you copy a file with a description
	   from the c: drive to the a: drive, the description will be
	   added to the a: drive file automatically.  The DIR command
	   then displays the descriptions next to the files similar
	   to the file lists on many BBS's.  4DOS provides a simple, 
	   command line editor for the descriptions.
	   4DIZ does not, however, require 4DOS.  You may use it with or
	   without 4DOS to create descriptions for disk catalog programs
	   that support 4DOS style descriptions, such as 4Cat v. 1.40.
