The following TIPS and TRICKS are provided courtesy of T&J SOFTWARE.
They are not related to ChAoS Online or to Chat With Lisa. But they
do use the same DoorFrame software as Lisa. So if you are having
problems with Lisa, the following information might help:


WILDCAT! 4.0
============
* Problems may develop using the DOOR.SYS drop file if you have
  a LARGE number of conferences. I would suggest picking up a copy
  of a file called FDOORSYS.ZIP written by Tim Rider (Tim can be
  reached on The Source BBS at 310-371-3737). Here is what Tim's
  documentation states:

* WildCat! 4.0 allows up to 32,000 conference areas. Due to the
  specifications of DOOR.SYS, all the conferences that a user is
  joined to are written to line #23 of DOOR.SYS.  32,000 conferences
  takes up a lot of room, and some SysOps have a DOOR.SYS file that may
  end up to be over 100k. Some doors have been choking on the large
  DOOR.SYS, so I wrote this small utility to remove that line."

* from FDOORSYS.DOC by Tim Rider

RENEGADE BBS
============
* If you are using BNU fossil driver and having problems with the
  doors, try using X00 v1.50+. Several Renegade systems have reported
  problems using BNU with the doors.

* If you are getting out of memory errors. Go into the System Config
  section, [E] System Toggles, then [U] to turn the SWAP FILE 'ON'.

TRIBBS v5.02+
=============
* Color ANSI checking will not work if you use TRIBBS.SYS drop file.
  Set the doors up using the PCBOARD.SYS drop file.

* If you use DOOR.SYS, TriBBS reloads this file and will deduct twice
  the amount of time that was actually used. Try using another drop
  file, or copying the DOOR.SYS to a separate directory and then
  telling the door to look there for it.

* NOTE: This only applies to doors where you adjust the user's time 
        in the door such as Bordello, Studs, and Studette.

Remote Access v2.0
==================
* Using DOOR.SYS may result in an OVERFLOW error -- try using a
  different caller drop file such as DORINFO1.DEF. This is currently
  being examined!

Keyboard Timeouts
=================
* If you are operating on a 486 computer and getting a "keyboard
  timeout", you will need to set the following environmental variable
  in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

  SET NO87=ON

  This will turn off your co-processor and allow the door to function
  properly.

Overflow Errors
===============
* Overflows can occur if you are running under DESQview and your tick
  counts are set too low -- try raising the tick counts.

* If you're running Wildcat! v3.9+ and are getting OVERFLOW errors,
  make sure NONE of your security level definitions have the MAXIMUM
  DAILY DOWNLOADS set to more than 32,000 -- anything over that will
  cause an OVERFLOW ERROR in ANY door using DOORFRAME.

Garbled Information on Remote
=============================
* If the door seems to operate fine on the BBS end but the remote
  cannot receive or receives garbled information, check and make sure
  you are passing the correct IRQ to the door (if you are running a
  non-standard IRQ).

Graphic Cards (general)
=======================
* ATI Graphics Ultra Pro card - do not use the ANSI.SYS driver that
  came with the card. Use the normal DOS ANSI.SYS for the screens
  to show correctly.

* Trident SVGA Cards - You should have a utility disk with a file
  called TANSI.SYS, use this ansi driver instead of the standard
  ANSI.SYS.

DESQview/X
==========
* Make sure you have the MATH COPROCESSOR flagged ON even if you don't
  have a math coprocessor.

Lockups on certain COM PORTS
============================
* If you're running on a non-standard IRQ, be sure you are passing the
  IRQ to the command line or batch file! Example:  LISA LISA.CFG /5

Wildcat! 3.x
============
* If you are running Studs!, Studette!, or Bordello! (from T&J Software) 
  you must use the caller drop file DOOR.SYS to make sure the callers 
  remaining time is passed back to Wildcat!

* Wildcat! IM Version Setup using DigiFossil v1.3:

  All of our doors will run on the Wildcat! IM version using DigiFos
  v1.3. I have received TWO different setup routines concerning the
  IM version, here's an example:

  DF LOCK%WCNODEID%           -OR-      DF ON
  CD\DOORS\STUDS                        CD\DOORS\STUDS
  STUDS! STUDS!.CFG /FD                 STUDS! STUDS!.CFG
  CD\WC30                               CD\WC30
  DF OFF                                DF OFF

  Comments on either setup would be greatly appreciated!

Spitfire BBS's
==============
* If you're having trouble with the doors dropping carrier on exiting
  back to the BBS, switch to using DOOR.SYS instead of SFDOORS.DAT. 
  This happens on some Spitfire configurations when using SFDOORS.DAT.

Using DESQview
==============
* If you're running the doors under DV and you're getting ANSI
  character codes on the local monitor, be sure to load the file
  DVANSI.COM in the main batch file that starts your BBS!
