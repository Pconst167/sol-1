      The No-Nonsense Licence Statement
      =================================
      This software and everything enclosed with it are protected by both
      Belgian copyright law and international treaty provisions.
      It is called "freeware".

      FREEWARE software may be used, copied and distributed freely for
      NONCOMMERCIAL use only IF:
      ฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿฿

              NO FEE IS CHARGED FOR USE, COPYING OR DISTRIBUTION.

              IT IS NOT MODIFIED IN ANY WAY.

      It may be distributed ONLY in it's original, unmodified compressed
      package file.                                ~~~~~~~~~~

      This means you may not add comments to the compressed package file
      (also known as an archive file or simply an archive), nor may you
      delete files from or add files to the archive file, UNLESS YOU HAVE
      A WRITTEN PERMISSION TO DO SO.

      Converting the archive file to another compression method or
      another archive file format is allowed, provided that the above
      conditions are met.

      The original package as released by me is in Yoshi's LZH archive
      format. (See below for what you should have received.)
      In order to extract the files from an LZH archive under DOS, you
      will need to get the file LHA***.EXE, where '***' stands for the
      version number of the program LHA.  At the time this is written,
      the latest version is 2.13, so look for LHA213.EXE.
      If you are using OS/2, look for Peter Fitzsimmons' LH2 program.
      The latest version of LH2 is 2.22, so look for LH2_222.EXE.
      Note, that recompressing the archive will nearly always result
      in a bigger archive.

      The use of FREEWARE software is prohibited in a governmental
      or commercial situation. In these cases, this software must be
      purchased and a Commercial Licence Statement will then be provided
      for.  You may write to the Owner at the address below for more

      ณ 2. INTRODUCTION ณ
      ิอออออออออออออออออพ

      The General Unpack Shell, or GUS, identifies compressed file types
      and calls the correct unpacker in order to extract the files from
      them.
      Its main purpose is, of course, to take work out of YOUR hands.
      You can use GUS with its straight-forward and easy to remember
      commands instead of having to learn a new set of commands each time
      a new archiver sees the daylight.

      GUS will also work nicely in automated tasks, where any type of
      archive should be uncompressed, or where a certain file has to be
      added to any given archive.

      GUS was made to be command-line compatible with the ARCE.COM
      unpacker program by Vernon Buerg.  This makes it possible for you
      to rename GUS.EXE to ARCE.COM and have it invoked by any program
      that expects both ARCE and SEA's ARC-type compressed files, so that
      such a program will in fact work with any archive format YOU
      choose. Ben Baker's MAKENL is but one example of such a program.

      GUS does not require you to fiddle with cumbersome and difficult
      configuration files: it's just a single EXE file.  You copy it into
      your favourite utility directory and you can immediately start
      using it, no hassles at all.


      ีออออออออออธ
      ณ 3. USAGE ณ
      ิออออออออออพ

      GUS assumes you have located all archiver programs it has to invoke
      somewhere in your system PATH.
      GUS is small and it will only occupy about 21K while shelling out
      to other programs, which should leave more than enough memory for
      those archiver programs.

      3.1. General Usage under DOS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
      --------------------
      GUS will run on any IBM PC compatible computer running DOS 3.0 or
      greater, provided that at least 25K plus the memory needed by the
      largest archiver program to invoke is available.

      COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS:
      ------------------------
      As said before, GUS is command-line compatible with ARCE.
      Hence, the general syntax is:

      GUS ฎcompressed_filespecฏ [filespec(s)] [target_path] [switch(es)]

      (Entries enclosed within [] are optional, those within ฎ ฏ are
      mandatory.  The [] and ฎ ฏ signs serve to indicate this only and
      should never be typed!)

      ฎcompressed_filespecฏ  ::=  this specifies where to find the
                                  compressed file.  If an extension
                                  is not given, GUS will assume '.*'.
                                  Currently, the following archive types
                                  are supported: ARC and ARC+, ARJ, DWC,
                                  HA, HAP, HPK, HYP, LZH (both LHarc and LHA),
                                  PAK, SQZ, UC2, ZIP and ZOO.

      [filespec(s)]          ::=  specifies which files should be
                                  unpacked. You may give more than one
                                  file specification, all of which may
                                  contain wild cards.

      [target_path]          ::=  specifies where to locate the unpacked
                                  files.  In order to allow GUS to be as
                                  flexible as possible, the ordering of
                                  the file specifications and the target
                                  path is not important.  You may define
                                  the target path first and then the
                                  files to be extracted.  It is even
                                  allowed to put the target path in the
                                  middle of a number of specifications of
                                  files to extract!  If you give more
                                  than one directory, GUS will ignore all
                                  but the last.

      [switch(es)]           ::=  specifies one or more of the following
                                  switches...
         /D     :  Delete archive after successful unpacking
         /I     :  Identify only, don't shell out (see 3.3 below)
         /M     :  unpack Mailarchives only (see 3.2 below)
         /N     :  do Not use embedded path while extracting
                   (for the sake of compatibility with ARCE, /5 may also be
                   used)
         /P     :  Print file(s) on standard output device
         /Q     :  Quiet mode, suppresses shell output
         /R     :  Replace existing files
         /T     :  Test archive integrity
         /V     :  View archive contents
         /Gpswd :  supply password 'pswd' for Garbled archive

      All parameters have to separated by at least one blank.  Switches
      may be joined together without spaces, but the '/' character must
      be present for each switch.  GUS does not support the dash '-'
      instead of the slash '/'.
      Options may be given in no matter what case. Only the Delete option
      _has_ to be in uppercase for safety reasons.

      NOTE:
      -----
      Consistent with ARCE's behaviour, GUS will create any directories
      contained within an archive if they do not exist.  Both ARCE and GUS
      have a commandline switch with which you can prevent this and have
      them extract to the current directory.
      If you are using the /M (mail archive) switch however, use of the
      /N (No embedded paths) switch is automatically assumed and unpacking
      will always be done in the current directory.
      With /M, the option /D (Delete archive after successful unpacking) is
      also automatically selected.
      The /N switch is equally automatically invoked with /P (print) and /T
      (test).
      Since SEA's XARC program cannot list the directory of an ARC+ (A7+)
      archive, GUS will switch to the program configured for the regular
      ARC type instead for the View Contents command.

      EXAMPLES:
      ---------
      1) Extract all files from an archive CFILE.ANY:
         > GUS CFILE.ANY

      2) Extract all *.COM and *.EXE files from an archive UTILS.ANY
         into a target directory D:\Utils and replace all existing ones:
         > GUS UTILS.ANY *.COM *.EXE D:\UTILS /R/N

      3) A batchfile LA.BAT which will list any text file inside any
         archive:
         LA.BAT: @echo off
                 GUS %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9 /P|LIST/S

         Then you can use this like:   LA KBUI_200 *.DOC

      4) Test the integrity of all archives in the directory F:\Arcs
         > GUS F:\ARCS\* /T

      5) Unpack all ZIPfiles PW*.ZIP protected with password JiMmY into
         the directory D:\PWS, not replacing any existing files and using
         any embedded paths:
         > GUS PW*.ZIP D:\PWS /GJiMmY

      EXIT CODES:
      -----------
      GUS will yield an errorlevel of 0 if all operations succeeded.
      If something's wrong, it will pass on the errorlevel returned by
      the child program invoked.
      If the child program could not be started, GUS will return
      errorlevel 202 = no such program file found in PATH
                 203 = non-existing directory
                 204 = too many open files (increase FILES=... parameter
                       in your CONFIG.SYS file)
                 205 = access denied
                 206 = invalid handle
                 208 = not enough memory to start the child program
                 210 = invalid environment
                 211 = invalid format
                 218 = no more files
      If the child program could be started but something else is wrong,
      GUS will return
      errorlevel   1 = for all errors not reported in the list below
                 220 = no such (mail) directory
                 221 = no such file(s)
      Note, that GUS will not be able to handle a PATH of more than 255
      characters properly.

      3.2. Unpacking Mailarchives
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      If you are a BBS SysOp or a Point connected to a Fidonet Technology
      compatible electronic mail network, you receive mail packets
      compressed and bundled within mailarchives.  You obviously need to
      unpack those mailarchives.
      You can do that in two ways:

      a) Have your mailprocessor call GUS to unpack the mailarchives.

       + If your mailprocessor allows you to specify which unpacker it
         should invoke to decompress mailarchives, have it call GUS.
         Example for ConfMail:
         > CM IMPORT AREAS.BBS -K -N -F Conf.Imp -A GUS
         This approach has the disadvantage that GUS will create any
         directories embedded in the archive, should they not exist.
         Another disadvantage is, that the mailprocessor is still in memory.
         This occupies a lot more memory than is necessary.

       + If your mailprocessor does not allow you to specify which
         unpacker to use, it will most likely expect ARCE or PKXARC/
         PKUNPAK.  Rename GUS.EXE to ARCE.COM or PKXARC.EXE or
         PKUNPAK.EXE, whatever your mailprocessor wants.
         If your mailprocessor wants to use an unpacker that needs a
         specific decompress command (like PAK E Archive), you cannot
         have it call GUS, since GUS would interpret its first
         command-line argument as the archive name.
         Use the method described in item b) to have GUS unpack your
         mailarchives BEFORE your mailprocessor is started.  Since your
         mailprocessor will only see mail packets then and no
         mailarchives, there will be no problem.

      b) Have GUS unpack all mailarchives BEFORE you invoke your
         mailprocessor. This is the preferred method.
         You this by starting GUS with the following command-line:

         GUS ฎInbound_directoryฏ /M

         Instead of the archive name, you specify the path to the
         directory where your inbound mail is located.
         Suppose your inbound directory is D:\Opus\NetFiles.  GUS will
         unpack all mailarchives in that directory with the following
         command:
         > GUS D:\OPUS\NETFILES /M

         After a mailarchive has been unpacked succesfully, GUS will
         delete it automatically.
         If a mailarchive cannot be unpacked succesfully, then GUS will
         create a subdirectory BADARC.GUS in your inbound directory and
         move that mailarchive to it.  This allows you to inspect the
         problematic mailarchives later on while retaining their original
         name.  Other unpack shells always rename a faulty archive to
         BADARC.001, which makes it very difficult if you would like to
         restore the archive to its original name after you have
         inspected and maybe repaired it.  I didn't like that procedure,
         so I decided to let GUS move problematic archives to a special
         subdirectory instead.  Let me know how you feel.

      3.3. Identifying Archive Types
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      With the /I switch, you can have GUS simply report which archive
      type is at hand and do nothing else.
      This switch can be used just to get a list of archive types, like
      this:
      > GUS J:\Outbound\*.MO? /I

      Type Archive Filename
      ---- ----------------
      LZH  J:\OUTBOUND\0009FE64.MO1
      ???  J:\OUTBOUND\8FDCB1E2.MO1
      ZIP  J:\OUTBOUND\8FDCB243.MO0
      ARJ  J:\OUTBOUND\FF24FFE9.MO0
      LZH  J:\OUTBOUND\8FDCB241.MO0

      GUS yields something like the above list.  The '???' means that GUS
      was unable to determine the archive type, possibly because it isn't
      an archive at all.  In this case, it was a zero-length file.

      A much more useful way of using this switch is to determine the
      type of just one archive and act upon that.  For instance, to add a
      file to any archive that comes along.
      If used with /I, GUS will return an errorlevel from 0 to 13,
      indicating the archive type.

      Archive Type: Unknown ARC ARC+ ARJ DWC  HA HAP HPK HYP LZH PAK
      Errorlevel  :    0      1   2    3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
      Archive Type:         SQZ UC2  ZIP ZOO
      Errorlevel  :          11  12   13  14

      Example: suppose you want to add a header text LOGO.TXT to ZIP and
      ARJ files, and leave other archive types alone.
      These batchfile instructions will take care of that:

        GUS %1 /I
        if not errorlevel 14 if errorlevel 13 goto IsZIP
        if not errorlevel  4 if errorlevel  3 goto IsARJ
        goto Finish
      :IsZIP
        PKZIP -z %1 <LOGO.TXT
        goto Finish
      :IsARJ
        ARJ c -zLOGO.TXT %1
      :Finish

      Please be advised that the errorlevel codes assigned to each archive
      type may change! If a new archive type is added to GUS, its extension
      will be merged into the list shown above so that the order of the
      extensions is alphabetical. If you don't like this and would rather see
      new types simply be added to the end of the list, let me know. I will
      comply with your wishes if enough people feel like that.
      At this time, I like to have an alphabetical list and so do most of the
      people I asked about this.

      The numbers above indicate the number of characters provided for
      each string.

      Note that Extract, Replace, Display, Test and View are COMMANDS,
      while Path and Password are OPTIONS.  The difference is, that an
      OPTION is always combined with a COMMAND and cannot be used alone.
      If the first character of the Path option is a `<', however, it means
      that the second character should be used to replace the first command
      string character. This is currently only the case with ARJ, HA and
      SQZ, who all need the `e' command to be replaced with `x' in order to
      extract files while using embedded path information.

      All spaces means that that particular program does not need any
      parameters for that particular command.

      All stars means that that particular program does not support that
      command or that option.

      ATTENTION! When encountering an ARC sfx made by SEA's MKSARC program,
      GUS will identify it correctly, but PKUNPAK can't handle this sfx and
      will therefore exit with an error. If you expect to handle a lot of
      MKSARC sfx files, then you'd better replace PKUNPAK by ARC 6.02 in GUS'
      configuration segment.

      You may want to redefine some of those built-in definitions for
      various reasons. To use another unpacker program, for instance.
      Or to change some parameters.

      4.2. How To Define Other Unpackers
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      There are two ways to modify the built-in definitions.

      You can grab a hex editor and change GUS.EXE directly. If you do,
      please take note of the lengths of the strings as listed above in
      section 4.1. All strings occupy the specified number of characters.
      To achieve that, they were padded with spaces where necessary. If you
      edit them, make sure you retain the number of characters and do NOT
      change the funny looking character at the start of each string
      (that's in fact the string length indicator byte). If a particular
      parameter is not supported by a certain unpacker program, then you
      should edit the appropriate field to contain all stars.

      If you own a Turbo Pascal compiler v5.0 or later from Borland
      International, you can edit the file GUS_WCG.PAS and re-compile it.
      This small program will update the configuration information at the
      end of GUS.EXE for you. Do *NOT* modify the record layout of that
      information, since GUS will not recognize it anymore if you do.

      Future versions of GUS may come with a complete setup program to
      edit and save a new configuration, or have a text configuration file.
      I haven't decided yet which way to go.

      ณ 5. GUS & OTHER SHELLS ณ
      ิอออออออออออออออออออออออพ

      Since GUS was first created, other authors have joined the club and
      released their own versions of a utility that identifies archive
      types and shells out to the appropriate unpacker programs.

      Some of those other shell programs come with source, others don't.
      Some have configuration files, others don't.
      Some are large, others small.
      Only one is GUS and all the others "ain't"! :-)

      Why should you use GUS?

      1. GUS is small and fast. Other shell programs typically use a lot
         more memory than GUS does.
      2. GUS provides you with all possible commands to allow not only
         automatic use, but also easy DOS command-line usage.
      3. While scanning a file to determine the archive type, the
         identification bytes have to be investigated in a well-defined
         order. Only then, the program will not be fooled by things like
         archives within archives.
         GUS is the only program that does this flawlessly: it will never
         be fooled.
      4. GUS has built-in code especially designed for archives that have
         their identification code at the end of the file.  If such an
         archive has been transmitted by means of a protocol like
         X-modem, some junk may have been appended to the file to make it
         grow to the next 128 byte or even 1 K-byte boundary!
         GUS is the *only* program that will recognize an archive with
         appended junk because it can skip that while scanning.
         (At this time, this is only needed for DWC archives, but you
         never know...)
      5. The HAP&PAH, HPack and DWC archivers require their compressed files
         to have the respective extension '.HAP', 'HPK' and '.DWC' or else
         they won't work with them. GUS knows this and will rename any such
         archive that does not have the proper extension before calling
         the dearchiver program and rename it back to the original name
         afterwards.
      6. Because *I* wrote it! <grin>


      ีออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออธ
      ณ 6. HOW GUS IDENTIFIES ARCHIVES ณ
      ิออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออออพ

      GUS recognizes archives by searching for well-defined patterns in the
      archive file. Such a pattern can be from 1 to 5 bytes in length and
      it is extremely important that they be checked in the PROPER ORDER!
      That is what distinguishes GUS from all it's competitors: most
      programs do search for the right patterns (with the exception of the
      pattern for ZOO, which is almost always wrong), but don't do this in
      the proper order. That can result in faulty identifications,
      specifically when encountering archives within archives.

      6.1. Recognition patterns as used by GUS
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      ArcType Offset  Pattern         Comment
      ------- ------  ------------    -------------------------------
      ARC     0       0x1A
      ARC+    0       0x1A            Method byte (offset 1) of all
      PAK                             entries needs to be scanned: if
      HYP                             >= 0x0A then PAK;
                                      >= 0x48 then HYP;
                                      == 0x14 then ARC+
                                      Note: PAK can also be recognized
                                      by locating the byte 0xFE at offset
                                      EOF-2, but GUS doesn't use that
                                      because it is less accurate than
                                      scanning the method bytes, which
                                      has to be done anyway for identi-
                                      fying ARC+ and HYP.
                                      For completeness, the record layout
                                      of an ARC archive will be given in
                                      item 2.
      ARJ     0       0x60 0xEA
      HA      0       'HA'            Offset 4 binary ANDed with 0xFC should
                                      yield 0x20. This is an additional check.
      DWC     -3      'DWC'           Offset -3 means the third LAST byte
                                      of the archive file.
                                      It is possible that some junk is
                                      present at the end of an archive,
                                      because of Xmodem transmissions for
                                      example.
                                      In order to avoid GUS not
                                      recognizing the archive because of
                                      this, the last 1028 bytes (or 343
                                      triplets) are read into a buffer
                                      and if that contains the string
                                      'DWC', then we have a DWC archive.
                                      An additional check will be done,
                                      however. The `DWC' string will have
                                      to be the last item in a 27 byte
                                      structure of which the first two
                                      items are ArcStrucSize=27 (2 bytes)
                                      and DirStrucSize=34 (1 byte) before
                                      GUS will accept the file to be a DWC
                                      archive.
      LZH     2       '-l??-'         The '?' specifies a wildcard
                                      character.
      HAP     0       0x91 '3HF'
      HPK     0       'HPAK'
      UC2     0       'UC2' 0x1A

      ZOO     20      0xDC 0xA7 0xC4 0xFD
                                      Most other programs search for the
                                      string 'ZOO' at the front of the
                                      archive, but that is wrong! Only
                                      the ZOO archives made using MS-DOS
                                      would be recognized this way. ZOO
                                      archives made by an Amiga or a
                                      computer running Unix would not
                                      necessarily be recognized this way.

      This is of course all in Turbo Pascal, the language in which GUS was
      written. The above are in fact literal excerpts from GUS's source
      code.

      6.3. How GUS identifies SFX (self-extracting) archives
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      The basic principle is simple. A self-extracting archive consists of an
      extraction program in EXE form followed by the archive itself as
      appended data.
      The header of an EXE file contains information to determine the size of
      the EXE portion of the file and hence the offset where the appended data
      starts.
      This proved to be true for all archive types, except for SFXs made by
      MKSARC, the ZIP/sfx as used in PKLTE115.EXE and the ZIP/sfx for OS/2.
      GUS has those offset values hardcoded.

      6.4. Mandatory order for scanning the patterns
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              1 - SQZ
              2 - ZIP
              3 - HPK
              4 - UC2
              5 - HAP
              6 - ZOO
              7 - LZH
              8 - HA
              9 - ARJ
             10 - DWC
             11 - ARC/PAK/ARC+/HYP

      This order is mandatory because it guarantees the greatest chance for
      a correct recognition.
      Every other order would enlarge the chance for a faulty result.
      This is also the reason why the archive specifications are still
      built into GUS and not given in a seperate configuration file (like
      PolyXarc, for example): I still haven't found a good method to have
      GUS determine automatically in which order the patterns have to be
      scanned, if a possibility exists that new patterns would be added to
      the list. I can't expect the users to include new patterns in the
      proper order themselves, can I?
      Therefore, I don't think providing GUS with a CFG file is very
      important at this time. I see no problem for providing a new GUS when
      a new and exciting archiver is released.

      That's it folks! If you're curious: the TP source for GUS is about
      870 lines in length. Those lines are `filled' in the same way as
      those of the procedure quoted above.

      NOTE: you may use the scanning and identification method as used by
      GUS and as described above in your own programs, but please be so kind
      and don't forget the reference indicating where you got the information!

      ณ 7. RUNTIME MESSAGES ณ
      ิอออออออออออออออออออออพ

      GUS may produce a number of messages while it's working.
      I will list all messages below, with an explanation what's wrong.

      [A] General information messages
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      MESSAGE: Child program returns exit code #
      -> this message is given when the invoked unpacker program returns
         control to GUS.  It shows the errorlevel returned by the
         unpacker program.  The "#" will be replaced by the actual
         exit code.

      [CHILD]: ฎunpacker_commandlineฏ
      -> this is shown in Quiet mode (/Q switch) instead of the
         archiver's screen output.  The ฎunpacker_commandlineฏ will be
         replaced by just that.

      Extract: ALL files (XARC cannot extract specific files)
      -> this message is shown when the first four characters of the
         unpacker program definition string are "XARC".  Any files to
         extract specified on the command-line will be ignored.


      [B] Warning messages
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      WARNING: multiple target directories defined -- will use the LAST one!
      -> you have defined more than one target path on the command-line.
         GUS warns you that it will ignore all paths but the last.

      WARNING: you need to use /D (capital!) to have the unpacked archive
               deleted.
      -> you have specified "/d" in lower case. For security reasons, GUS
         will only accept a capital D for the Delete switch.

      WARNING: unknown switch /X ignored
      -> you have specified a switch that GUS doesn't know.  In the above
         warning message, the "X" will be replaced by the actual
         character (converted to upper case) that you used.
         GUS will continue but ignores this unknown switch.

      WARNING: a slash by itself is not a valid option -- ignored
      -> you have typed a slash "/" followed by a space or an end-of-line.
         GUS will continue and ignore this.

      WARNING: unknown parameter #9 ฎXฏ ignored
      -> you have typed something on the command-line that GUS can't
         decipher.  The actual word you typed will be inserted instead of
         "X" in the above message, and the number of that parameter on
         the commandline will be shown instead of the "9" above.

      WARNING: unable to determine archive type due to error
               while opening file
      -> for some reason, GUS can't open the file it has to investigate.
         Bummer! GUS will simply skip it and continue with the next one, if
         any.

      WARNING: can't open NUL device -- Quiet command ignored
      -> this occurs most often if the /Q (Quiet) command is used and when
         one or more TSRs were loaded with their output redirected to NUL.
         This yields a DOS sharing violation error, hence this message from
         GUS.

      WARNING: moving bad archive HHHHHHHH.XX9 to X:\Inbound\BADARC.GUS\
      -> in mail unpack mode (/M switch), GUS was unable to unpack an
         archive and warns you that it will be moved to the BADARC.GUS
         subdirectory that GUS creates in the mail inbound directory.
         The actual name of the bad archive will be inserted in the
         message instead of "HHHHHHHH.XX9" and "X:\Inbound" will be
         replaced by the path to your mail inbound directory.

      WARNING: switching to ARC type program for directory of A7+ archive
      -> if the program XARC is configured for handling A7+, GUS will
         switch to the archiver program configured for the ARC type for
         viewing the archive contents (directory), since XARC has no
         command to do it and both PKUNPAK and SEA's ARC 6.02 will list
         the directory of an ARC+ archive fine.

      WARNING: unsupported command -- will do normal extract instead
      -> you tried to perform an action not supported by the particular
         archiver defined within GUS (i.e., issue a /T [test] command
         with the HYPER archiver program).
         GUS warns you it will ignore that command and do a normal
         extract instead.

      WARNING: XXX type cannot be unpacked into embedded directories!
      -> the unpacker program has no option to enable using embedded
         directories or creating them, so all unpacking will be done
         into the current directory, since that is the only way.

      WARNING: XXX type cannot be garbled - ignoring password...
      -> you supplied an extraction password for an archive whose
         unpacker program does not support password-protection.
         GUS will continue the command while ignoring the /G switch.
         The "XXX" will be replaced by the actual archive type detected.

      [C] Fatal error messages
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      >ERROR<: cannot read configuration information!
      MESSAGE: aborting with exit code 255...
      -> GUS complains it can't find the configuration information at the
         back of it's EXE file.  This means something is terribly wrong
         with that EXE file.  You better delete it and get the original
         release archive unpacked again!  (You *did* save that one,
         didn't you?)

      >ERROR<: cannot create new filename for rename or move!
      -> while trying to rename (like when an archiver need a fixed
         extension) or move (like when a mailarchive couldn't be unpacked)
         a file, GUS increments the filename (in case of a fixed extension)
         or the extension (in case of a bad mailarchive) when it at first
         doesn't succeed with the rename or move. If the filename or
         extension cannot be incremented anymore and no other options are
         left, GUS issues the above error message.

      >ERROR<: cannot erase unpacked archive!
      -> in mail unpack mode (/M switch) or if the Delete option (/D switch)
         was used, GUS is unable to delete the archive after it has been
         unpacked successfully.
         This more than likely means that the archive was marked
         Read/Only.  You will have to unlock and delete it manually.
         As mailarchives are created fresh upon receipt, it is very
         unlikely that they would be marked R/O.

      >ERROR<: can't rename fixed extension back to original, leaving as is...
      -> GUS had to rename an archive to a name with the fixed extension
         required by archivers like DWC, HAP or HPACK and now it can't rename
         the file back to the original name. This can normally only happen
         in a multitasking environment, for instance when the archive file
         was renamed, moved or deleted before GUS could rename it back.
         GUS issues this error message and leaves the file as it was.

      >ERROR<: DOS couldn't execute ฎXXXฏ due to: YYY
      -> GUS was unable to load and execute the unpacker program.
         The path and name of that unpacker will be inserted in the error
         message instead of "XXX" and the reason will be shown instead of
         "YYY".  That reason will be one of 9 possible problems
         described in section 3.1. General Usage under DOS, EXIT CODES.
         If the error code returned by DOS should be unknown to GUS, it
         will display "DOS ERROR" followed by the error number instead.

      >ERROR<: error locating directory XXX
               will unpack in current directory.
      -> You specified a target directory GUS was unable to find.  The
         target path specification will be ignored and the unpacking will
         be done in the current directory.

      >ERROR<: ฎXXXฏ is no archive file or a type unkown to GUS!
      -> GUS encountered a file that is not one of the known archive
         types.  GUS will continue with the next file, if there is one.
         "XXX" will be replaced by the actual archive name.

      >ERROR<: no such file(s)!
      -> GUS was started with an archive filename specification, but no
         such file could be found.  GUS will abort with errorlevel 221.

      >ERROR<: no such mail directory!
      -> you specified a mail inbound directory (/M switch) that GUS was
         unable to locate.  GUS will end with errorlevel 220.

      Ver.   Comment
      ~~~~   ~~~~~~~
      1.80 - Supported the new Dutch archiver UltraCompressor II (UC2).
             It performs consistently better than either PKZIP or ARJ, but HA
             and HPACK are still the best compressors around (albeit very
             slow).
           - Added the '/V' (View archive contents) command. Originally, I
             wanted to implement my own archive lister. However, since I still
             don't have the exact layout for a couple of archive types, I
             didn't want to keep you waiting any longer and provided the lister
             by shelling out to the appropriate archiver.
           - The GUS help screen will now also be shown when the user types
             GUS /?, GUS -?, GUS /h, GUS -h, GUS /H or GUS -H.
             Suggested by Hans Siemons (2:512/149).
           - If the drive is full (0 bytes free), GUS is unable to move
             a bad mailarchive away. GUS v1.70 would check the drive space
             and abort the move if less than 32 bytes would be free.
             32 bytes is indeed what's needed to create a new directory entry,
             but unfortunately this doesn't help much since DOS always needs
             the size of one cluster to allocate new space.
             This version of GUS will therefore check if at least the size of
             one cluster (or 256 bytes for HPFS volumes) is free.
             Error reported by Peter Smink (2:285/1).
           - GUS file /I will yield errorlevel 221 if the file doesn't exist,
             instead of errorlevel 1 reported by the previous version which was
             confusing (since it could also mean GUS found an ARC archive).
             Changed two errorlevels:
             ERROR                   ErrLev v1.70  ErrLev NOW
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^  ^^^^^^^^^^
             No Such Mail Directory! 0             220
             No Such File(s)!        1             221
             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             Problem reported by Kianusch Sayah-Karadji (2:310/3.80).
           - Just in case you were wondering: I'm using Borlands BPwO v7.0
             these days for compiling GUS. No, the sourcecode for GUS doesn't
             contain any OOP. I wanted to keep GUS small and OOP has a tendency
             to blow the size of EXE files to huge proportions.

      1.70 - Added support for the Dutch HAP archive format, which compresses
             at least 10% better than PKZIP v2.04.
           - Added support for the Finnish HA archiver, which beats PKZIP
             v2.04 by more than 20%!
           - Added the "/D" or Delete option.
           - Added detection of SFX (self-extracting) archives.
             GUS will recognize all EXE variants of the known archive types.
             Note: GUS can't handle COM self-extractors made by LHarc 1.xx,
             only the EXE sfx version.
           - If the drive is full (0 bytes free), GUS is unable to move
             a bad mailarchive away. It would take quite some time before
             GUS would give up trying, though. Fixed: GUS will check
             the drive space and abort the move if less than 32 bytes are
             free. (32 bytes is what's needed to create a new directory entry.)
           - If a file could not be opened for the purpose of determining
             the archive type, a runtime error 103 resulted. Fixed.
             Added a message: ฎWARNING: unable to determine archive type due
             to error while opening fileฏ.
           - Some people experienced strange `runtime 162' errors.
             Here's what happened...
             GUS tried to open the NUL device and create it. Some environments
             may have objected to that.
             I changed the code so that the NUL device is opened for writing
             only (no creation) and only if the /Q option is used, not always
             like before.
             This still caused some systems to yield that runtime error, so I
             added an error check and disabled the Quiet mode in case the NUL
             device cannot be opened. That should solve the `runtime 162'
             problem once and for all...
             Added a message: ฎWARNING: can't open NUL device -- Quiet command
             ignoredฏ.
             (This problem appeared mostly with systems that loaded TSRs and
             redirected their output to the NUL device. That causes DOS to
             open but never close the NUL device, so when GUS tries to open
             it, a sharing violation (runtime 162) occurs.)
             Thanks to Wim Van Sebroeck, 292/862 and Bert Hubert, 2:281/506.40
             for assisting me in finding a fix for this.

      1.61 - Fixed a bug which caused GUS to use the wrong archive name
             when operating with an archiver that requires a fixed archive
             extension (DWC and HPK at this time).

      1.60 - Added support for the HPACK archiver from Peter Gutmann, which
             makes the absolutely smallest archives at this time.
           - Added support for the Swedish SQZ archiver, which compresses
             better than ARJ 2.30 or the new PKZIP 1.93a!
           - Previously, the first three archive types were: ARC (#1), ARJ
             (#2) and ARC+ (#3). From now on, ARC+ will be #2 and ARJ #3.
             This is more logical. (The reason for the previous order was
             that GUS uses the abbreviation ARp internally for ARC+, and
             ARp comes after ARJ alphabetically.)
           - Due to a string length mismatch, GUS couldn't tell whether
             UsePath or UsePassword options were supported or not. The
             UsePath problem was reported by Wim Van Sebroeck (2:292/862)
             and by checking that, I discovered that the same was true for
             the UsePassword option. Corrected.
           - Added code to allow the Path option to replace a command
             instead of being added to it. (Indicated by `<' as the first
             character in the Path option in GUS_WCFG.PAS)
             Only needed for ARJ and SQZ at this time. (The previously used
             `e -jf' for ARJ doesn't seem to work equal to `x', so that was
             changed.)
           - GUS `forgot' about the specification indicating which files had
             to be extracted, once an ARC+ type archive had been worked on.
             Reported by Wim Van Sebroeck (2:292/862) and fixed.
           - If the specified target directory ended with a backslash (\),
             GUS wouldn't recognize it as the target directory. Reported by
             Wim Van Sebroeck (2:292/862) and fixed.
           - Extract command for ARJ changed from `e -n' to `e -uy' and
             modified some other archiver parameters in order to make the
             behaviour of various archiver programs more homogenious.
             GUS without /R option:
             (1) XARC and HYPER will ask you if they should overwrite older
                 files. Unfortunately, these programs have no command
                 options to work in batchmode and avoid this.
             (2) HPACK will never overwrite older files because it doesn't
                 have an option for this.
             (3) all other archivers will overwrite older files and skip
                 the rest.
             GUS with /R will cause existing files always to be
             overwritten.
           - If someone would combine several real commands on the GUS
             commandline, the effects might not be what one desires.
             Example: GUS * /T /R would start unpacking when one would
             expect it to ignore the replace command and do a test only.
             So I have changed the behaviour. The /T command now has priority
             over all other commands. This means that if you specify multiple
             commands, the /T (test) command will be executed and all others
             ignored. If you specify /P and /R, the /P has a higher priority
             and will be executed. The /R will be ignored. The priority of a
             command increases if it can do less damage. So the priority order
             for the GUS commands is in descending order: /I /T /P /R
             (remember: the other switches are options, not commands!).
             This problem was discovered after a tip by Alex Cleynhens
             (2:292/500).
           - Additional check for DWC archives. Apart from the string `DWC'
             in the last 1K of the file, it is now required that this string
             is the last item in a 27 byte structure for the file to be
             identified as a DWC archive.
           - GUS reported a runtime error when trying to rename an archive to
             a fixed extension and if the new name existed already. Reported
             by Wim Van Sebroeck (2:292/862). Fixed: the name is now
             incremented. Modified the routine which moves bad mailarchives
             to the BADARC.GUS subdirectory as well: if a file with the
             same name already exists in the BADARC.GUS subdirectory, the
             extension of the file to be moved is incremented.
           - GUS had a problem if the target directory was a root directory.
             In that case, it specified only the drive instead of the root
             directory. Reported by Wim Van Sebroeck (2:292/862). Fixed.
           - HPACK seems to require that its archives have a fixed extension
             of .HPK (like DWC does). GUS directory /M /T doesn't move bad
             archives into the BAD_ARC.GUS directory. Reported by Peter Smink
             (2:285/1). Fixed.
           - Various changes to the documentation.

      1.50 - Added the /N (/5) switch to prevent GUS using or creating
             paths embedded within archives.
           - Made this switch automatic while working with mail archives
             (/M).  Thanks to John Lots (2:512/36.3@fidonet.org) and Eef
             Hartman (2:281/603.5) for suggesting this and detecting the
             problem with this in GUS 1.40.
             /N is now also automatically invoked with /P and /T.
           - Changed the way the configuration information is stored a bit,
             since there was a useless amount of space being reserved for
             the "Unknown" type, which of course shouldn't have been saved.
           - Fixed a minor problem which caused a runtime error when
             GUS.EXE was given a read/only attribute.  Thanks to Rob
             Essers (2:283/406.2) for reporting this.
           - Cleaned up the batchfile listing in section 3.3 a bit.
             Thanks to Roelof Heuvel (27:3331/5000@signet.ftn) for the
             suggestion.
           - Fixed a minor problem which caused GUS to not append '.*'
             to a filename given without an extension when the pathame
             would contain a dot somewhere.  Thanks to Hans Siemons
             (2:285/214@fidonet.org) for reporting it.
           - Because of a space inserted between the appropriate switch to
             supply a password to an unarchiver and the actual password it-
             self, encrypted archives could never be unpacked. This is now
             fixed.
           - Made minor modifications for PKUNZIP 2.00, due to some changes
             in the way that one handles its command options.
           - The `use path' option was always supplied with the ZOO unpack
             commands. Corrected.

      1.40 - Removed MDCD archive support again, since nobody was likely
             to use it -- unless you're looking for the worst performing
             archiver ever, of course.
           - Added support for the new LHA version 2 archiver from Yoshi,
             which succeeds LHARC.  The previous version of GUS could
             already handle the new compression, but I didn't expect the
             name of the program to be changed.
           - Added support for the ARJ archiver program from Robert K.
             Jung, which yields nearly always the best compression and
             has a lot of features.
           - Added support for the HYPER archiver program from Germany,
             which seems to outperform every other archiver on 600..800K
             logfiles ONLY.  Weird.
           - Added support for ARCfiles made by the new ARC version 7
             compressor from SEA.  At this time, only one public domain
             extractor is available, which unfortunately lacks almost
             every feature GUS has to offer.
             My thanks to Donn Bly (1:236/7@fidonet.org) and Jeffrey
             Nonken (1:273/715@fidonet.org) for providing me with all the
             information on the ARC7+ archive format and the XARC
             program.
           - GUS is now fully commandline compatible with Vernon Buerg's
             ARCE program.  All of ARCE's switches are supported - except
             for /5, which prevents ARCE from creating subdirectories
             contained within ARCfile entries.
           - GUS provides two extra options: /I will identify an archive
             type by means of the exitcode (errorlevel) and /M will
             unpack and delete mailarchives in Fidonet Technology
             Networks.
           - BUGFIXES:
             * cleaned up handling zero-length and read/only files.
               From now on, GUS won't abort with a runtime error on
               those. 
             * you could only specify one single file to extract on GUS's
               commandline, although the help screen and manual suggested
               you could give more than one filespec.
               That's also corrected now, so you can indeed specify
               multiple files.
           - OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
             * the code which detects the archive type has been completely
               re-written and now is a *lot* faster than before!

      1.31 - This version was never released, but mentioned in the
             documentation of the ARCA*Simulator v2.31 (ASIM_231.LZH).

      1.30 - This version was never released, but mentioned in the "Latest
             Software Versions" column of the FidoNews magazine.

      1.20M  Added MDCD archives, corrected an error which made GUS not
             recognize uncompressed file entries in an LZH archive, made sure
             the new compression method of PAK is supported, added features to
             allow selection of files and target directory for unpacking.
             This is a maintenance release, hence the 'M' behind the version
             number.

      1.10 - Added LZH archives, and changed the way DWC archives are
             identified in order to identify them even if up to 1K of rubbish
             is appended to the end of a DWC archive. This is useful for DWC
             archives which have been transferred by means of an Xmodem
             protocol.

      1.00 - Base version.  (Turbo Pascal 5.0)
