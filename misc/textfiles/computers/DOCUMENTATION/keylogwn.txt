KEYLOGWN.EXE is a WINDOWS version 1.5 of a shareware utility that records 
ALL ascii keystrokes to an ascii file on C:\dos\logx. It is very useful if 
you are using a wordprocessor and accidently forget to save the file that you 
have been working on, or simply want to know who has been doing what on your 
PC. History files are retained with the time and date encoded in the name, 
for example, 10301125.94W would be a history file created at 10:30 AM on Nov. 
25, 1994. When first run, KEYLOGWN.EXE will create the logx directory on C:, 
if it doesn't already exist. This program has a $5.00 registration fee. The 
user should take care to erase history files when no longer needed since 
these files will contain a record of ALL ascii keystrokes, even if the 
application intentionally does not echo them to the screen. Please distribute 
this shareware version freely.   

The program comes with four files. The VBRUN300.DLL should be copied to 
the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. Also the QPRO200.DLL should be placed in the
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory. You are reading the KEYLOGWN.DOC file now. The
KEYLOGWN.EXE program can be installed by going to WINDOWS SETUP and 
setting up this specific application (KEYLOGWN.EXE). Unzip the KEYLOGWN.ZIP 
file and create a directory on the hard drive for them. Then copy QPRO200.DLL 
to the \WINDOWS\SYSEM directory. Windows will generate an icon for KEYLOGWN 
when installed with the WINDOWS SETUP program in the MAIN folder. The user 
should then move the icon to the windows STARTUP folder and set the 
properties to RUN MINIMIZED. In this manner, whenever WINDOWS is started, 
the keystroke recorder will automatically be initialized. A DOS version of 
this program is also available from the author.
