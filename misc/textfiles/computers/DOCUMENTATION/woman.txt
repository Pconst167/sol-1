        Short description: All it is unwise to know about women.


        Long description: This is the bravest compilation of writings
        about women there has ever been.  To say these writings are
        dangerous would be an understatement.  For the first time, read
        the naked truth about women, and learn all it is unwise to know
        about them.  You are presented with a selection of astounding
        quotes about women, along with exceptional writings from
        Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, and Freud.  There are also
        memorable writings from the Buddhist and Hindu philosophers,
        and more.

        POISON FOR THE HEART:   The ultimate philosophy.

        Written in an aphoristic style for those who don't like to waste
        their time with padding.  Discusses the law of cause and effect
        and its far reaching ramifications.  Investigates the nature of
        the ego, attachment, religion, men and women.  Arguably the only
        book a thinking person needs to read.


        POWER WORDS contains over FIVE THOUSAND quotes, aphorisms,
        witticisms and quips compressed into a single program file.
        Searching is lightning fast because all of the entries are held
        in memory - no time-consuming disk access is necessary.  Press a
        key to send quotes to your printer or to a text file on disk.


        WIT FOR WISDOM:   Compact truth.

        "Wit for Wisdom" is a compilation of the most incisive gems of
        wit, along with a few drops of my own blood.  Unlike normal
        collections of quotes, aphorisms and apothegms, this work has
        both a purpose and a message.  So this is not so much a book for
        wits, but for thinkers.  Wit for wisdom is a kind of wit that is
        too witty even for wits.  Of all the areas of interest covered
        in this work, the subjects of the sexes and the relationships
        between them predominate, they being responsible for the larger
        part of our foolishness.  The viewing program allows you to send
        the text to your printer or to a text file on disk.


        THE LOVE BASE:  for the idealistic spirit

        best love poems to bring fire to even the coldest of hearts, and
        to awaken the idealist within your soul.  Learn of love's
        beauty, fantastic love, erotic love, the contradictions of love,
        love's lies, and the humour of love.
