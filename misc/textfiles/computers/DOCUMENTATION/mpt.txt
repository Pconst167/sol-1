                                      FEATURES

         The MPt Protocol is a powerful tool for getting your data from one
         place to another through a serial link.  Whether downloading or
         uploading files to and from a bulletin board system, or moving
         files between PC compatible computers over a serial cable without
         a modem, you will find that MPt will do the job, and will do it
         quickly and accurately.

         MPt offers many advanced features:

           þ Full color screen display of transfer status.
           þ Standalone setup program for changing default options,
             configuring screen colors, and installing registration
             information.
           þ UART (serial port) baud rates up to 115200 bps.
           þ Auto-sensing of 8250, 16450, 16550, and 16550A UARTs.  Full
             support for 16550A FIFO buffers.
           þ The ability to use COM ports 1 through 4, with each port's IRQ
             and base I/O address fully configurable.
           þ Call Data Standard (CDS) logging of file transfers.
           þ Enhanced DSZ compatible logging of file transfers.
           þ All screen operations use direct video memory access, or
             DESQview, TaskView, OmniView, TopView, Microsoft Windows, and
             IBM 3270 PC multi-tasking video buffers (MTVB), if present.
           þ Optional auto-start of the protocol receiver.
           þ Optional data compression on a block level using RLE
             techniques.
           þ Fast and reliable recovery from line and data errors.
           þ Dynamic block scaling for optimal data throughput.
           þ Up to 99 files transferred in a batch.

         2 - G e t t i n g   S t a r t e d
         __________________________________________________________________


         For experienced users who wish to get a quick start using the MPt
         Protocol, this brief chapter has been included to help you along.
         For a complete explanation of how to use the protocol and the
         setup program, continue reading beyond this chapter.


                                   THE HELP SCREEN

         When you run MPt the first time, try executing MPT.EXE
         without parameters.  You will see a screen full of information
         about command line options.  This screen is your "quick reference"
         card, so to speak.  It will help you to get the software running
         if you choose not to read the rest of the documentation right
         away.


                                  THE SETUP PROGRAM

         Also included with MPt is a file called MPTSET.EXE.  This program
         allows you to change the software's default options and screen
         colors, and to enter registration information.

         In order for the setup program to operate, you must be logged to
         the drive and directory containing the MPT.EXE file (the MPt
         Protocol program).  Type MPT, and press enter.  If the setup
         program cannot read the MPT.EXE file in the current directory, or
         the file has been corrupted, you will be alerted.

         Much of the setup program is self-explanatory, but a few things
         might not be obvious without some explanation:

           þ When choosing a baud rate for the UART, the value of "Current"
             will cause the software to sense and use the current baud rate
             of the UART when MPT.EXE is executed.

           þ When choosing an "effective" baud rate, the value of "UART"
             will cause MPt to use the UART baud rate (whether specified or
             auto-sensed) as the "effective" baud rate.

           þ In the "Adjust screen colors" mode, pressing the M key will
             cause the color scheme to change to monochrome.  If you use a
             monochrome monitor, you may wish to use this option
             immediately upon entering the color set screen.  To return to
             the default color set, press the C key.  Both of these keys
             destroy any changes made to the color set before saving!

           þ In the "Change default options" screen, the options that you
             choose will be written to the MPT.EXE file as defaults.  When
             running MPt, you may override any of these defaults by using
             command line parameters, detailed in Chapter 3.

         3 - T h e   M P t   P r o g r a m
         __________________________________________________________________


         This chapter will familiarize you with the MPt Protocol, and its
         features and command line parameters.


                                     RUNNING MPT

         To load and run the MPt program, a command line must be given.
         This command line can come from the keyboard, at the MS-DOS
         prompt, from a batch file, or from a calling program, such as a
         BBS, which loads MPt directly without using the DOS command.com
         program.

         This command line has a specific syntax.  Here are the three
         general formats for the MPt command line:

           MPT [options] s filespec [filespec] [filespec] [...]
           MPT [options] s @listfile
           MPT [options] r [path]

         Anything appearing in square brackets is optional, and may not
         need to be specified for proper operation of MPt.

         Note that MPt completely ignores the "case" of the command line,
         which means that upper and lowercase characters may be mixed in
         any combination.

         The word "MPT" at the beginning of each command line is required
         in all cases.  This is what tells MS-DOS to load the MPT.EXE
         program file.

         The "options" are outlined below, in the "Program Options"
         section.

         The "s" and "r" letters, which follow the options, are required on
         the command line.  The letter "s" tells MPt to send files to
         another computer, while "r" tells MPt to receive files from
         another computer.

         The "filespec", "@listfile", and "path" portions of the command
         lines are described below, in the sections entitled "Sender File
         Specifications" and "Receiver File Specifications".


                                   PROGRAM OPTIONS

         The MPt Protocol offers a number of features and settings.  This
         section will explain each command line option, and how each
         affects MPt operation.  Note that a plus (+) in the syntax enables
         an option, while a minus (-) disables it.




                                                                Page 4




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         Following is a description of each option:


         ------------------------------------
         A+ or A-  (delete aborted downloads)
         ------------------------------------
         If enabled (A+), this setting will cause MPt to delete the
         transferred portion of any files that were not fully received.

         If disabled (A-), this setting will cause the protocol to leave
         any partially received files on the disk.  This gives the user the
         option of continuing the transfer later, by using the "Allow
         Resumed Transfers" option.

         Note:  This parameter has no effect when used in the send mode.


         --------------------------------
         B+ or B-  (beep upon completion)
         --------------------------------
         Enabling this setting causes MPt to emit a series of beeps to
         alert the user when a transfer is finished.  The beeper will sound
         regardless of whether the transfer was a success.

         Disabling this setting causes the program to remain silent at all
         times.


         -------------------------
         CDSx  (log to a CDS file)
         -------------------------
         This option allows the user to specify a log file where MPt will
         create a CDS log entry for each file transferred.  You may replace
         "x" with any valid DOS drive:\path\file combination.  If only
         "CDS" is specified, with no value for "x", a CDS log entry will
         not be written to any file.  For example, the following command
         line will receive files, and each will be logged using CDS to the
         file "c:\logs\mptlog":

            MPT CDSc:\logs\mptlog r

         Whereas, the following receiver command line will not log the
         files in CDS format:

            MPT CDS r

         For information on the CDS log format, see Appendix A, "Log File
         Formats".

         -----------------------------------
         D+ or D-  (stamp with current date)
         -----------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, will cause MPt to stamp each received
         file with the current time and date of the transfer.
         When this setting is disabled, MPt will stamp the file with the
         original time and date that are passed in a header packet at the
         beginning of each file transfer.

         This is a useful setting for BBS SysOps who wish to date-stamp
         their files according to when they were uploaded.

         Note:  The D+/- option has no effect when used in the send mode.



         -------------------------
         Ex  (effective baud rate)
         -------------------------
         When using this option, the "x" may be replaced by a numeric value
         between 0 and 115200, inclusive.  A non-zero value will adjust the
         effective baud rate to the specified value.  A value of zero will
         cause MPt to set the effective baud rate to the same value as the
         UART baud rate.  See the section below entitled, "Sx (UART baud
         rate)" for information on UART baud rates.

         * * * * * * * * * * * Effective Baud Rates  * * * * * * * * * * *
         Typically, the baud rate of the UART (serial port) is displayed
         and logged by communications programs as the baud rate used during
         the session.  However, many modems communicate with the computer
         at one baud rate, while communicating over the phone line at a
         different baud rate.
         For example, the USRobotics Courier 14400 HST modem can
         communicate with another Courier HST modem at an effective baud
         rate of 14400 bits per second.  However, the modem is actually
         communicating with the UART at 19200 bps.

         Because of this difference in UART baud rate and effective baud
         rate, MPt allows each to be specified separately.  MPt will use
         the effective baud rate to calculate estimated transfer times and
         efficiency percentages which are displayed during a transfer.

         F+ or F-  (enable 16550A FIFO buffers)
         --------------------------------------
         This option is only effective when the COM port in use has a
         16550A or equivalent UART installed.  When enabled, this setting
         allows MPt to enable the FIFO buffers on the 16550A, and to use
         them during the transfer.  When this setting is disabled, the FIFO
         buffers will be disabled during the transfer.  MPt will always
         return the UART to the state it was in when MPt began.

         In almost all cases, this setting should remain enabled.  The
         disable option is provided for users who wish to emulate the 16450
         UART with a 16550A UART during MPt transfers.


         --------------------
         HF  (handshake fast)
         --------------------
         This setting enables fast hardware handshaking during file
         transfers.

         If you are unsure whether to use hardware handshaking, it is a
         good idea to consult your modem manual.  Most 300, 1200, and 2400
         baud modems do not use hardware handshaking.  However, MNP modems
         do, as do high-speed modems, such as the USR Courier 14400 HST,
         and the USR HST/Dual Standard.

         When using MPt to transfer files over a direct-connect link
         between two computers, hardware handshaking may not be necessary,
         but should be enabled in case one computer sends faster than the
         other can receive.

         * * * * * * * * * * * Hardware Handshaking * * * * * * * * * * *
         Hardware handshaking uses two pins on the serial port, called CTS
         (an input), and RTS (an output) to arbitrate data flow to and from
         the serial port.

         The rules of CTS/RTS handshaking are fairly easy to understand:

         1) Data may be sent to a serial port as long as the CTS line is
            high.  If the CTS line goes low, the sender must stop
            transmitting data until CTS again goes high.

         2) When ready to receive data, the receiver must raise the RTS
            line.  If, at some point, the receiver cannot receive data, it
            must lower the RTS line until data can be received again.
         * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


         ------------------------------
         HD  (handshake on disk writes)
         ------------------------------
         This setting enables fast hardware handshaking and disk write
         handshaking.

         Disk write handshaking causes the protocol to lower the RTS line
         whenever data is being written to disk.

         This setting is useful for computers that have BIOS or DOS disk
         drivers that cause hardware interrupts to be disabled for extended
         periods of time.  MPt can not read data from the UART while
         interrupts are disabled.  As a result, it is not uncommon at baud
         rates of 9600 or more, to get "overrun errors".  If the disk
         drivers are the cause of this problem, then this setting will very



                                                                Page 7




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         likely solve the problem.  If overrun errors are continually
         occurring, you may need to use the HS parameter (detailed below).

         Note:  The HD parameter is typically used by the receiver (where
                disk writes occur).  However, the sender may use this
                setting to force the receiver (on the other end) to use
                disk write handshaking.


         --------------------
         HN  (no handshaking)
         --------------------
         This option completely disables CTS/RTS handshaking.

         --------------------
         HS  (handshake slow)
         --------------------
         This setting enables slow hardware handshaking and disk write
         handshaking.

         Slow handshaking is useful for receiving files on a computer that
         is too slow to process received characters at the UART baud rate.
         In this situation, the RTS line is toggled to pace the sender to a
         speed suitable for the slow machine to process the data.

         If you are experiencing overrun errors while receiving files with
         MPt, try using the HD parameter (detailed above), or the HS
         parameter.  If the errors continue, another possible solution is
         to install a 16550A UART in your serial port or internal modem.
         MPt supports the 16550A UART's provisions for buffering received
         data, which takes part of the load off of the CPU.

         Note:  The HS parameter is typically used by the receiver.
                However, the sender may use this setting to force the
                receiver (on the other end) to use slow handshaking.


         -----------------------
         Lx  (log to a DSZ file)
         -----------------------
         This option allows the user to specify a log file where MPt will
         create a DSZ log entry for each file transferred.  You may replace
         "x" with any valid DOS drive:\path\file combination.  If only "L"
         is specified, with no value for "x", a DSZ log entry will not be
         written to any file.  For example, the following command line will
         receive files, and each will be logged to the file "c:\logs\log":

            MPT Lc:\logs\mptlog r

         Whereas, the following receiver command will not write a log file:

            MPT L r

         For information on the DSZ log format, see Appendix A.



                                                                Page 8

         --------------------------------------
         N+ or N-  (monitor the carrier signal)
         --------------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, will cause MPt to end if the DCD
         signal (carrier) is lost during a transfer.

         When this setting is disabled, MPt will ignore the state of the
         DCD signal.

         Note:  BBS SysOps should enable this setting, so if a user drops
                carrier during a transfer, MPt will end, and control will
                be immediately restored to the BBS software.


         --------------------------------------------
         O+ or O-  (allow overwriting received files)
         --------------------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, allows MPt to overwrite existing
         files.  For example, if a file header is received for "foo.bar",
         and a file of the same name already exists in the receive path,
         MPt will delete the old file and write the new one under the same
         name.

         If this setting is disabled, MPt will not allow a received file to
         overwrite another file.


         ---------------------
         Px  (COM port number)
         ---------------------
         This setting tells MPt which COM port to use.  The "x" may be
         replaced by a value between 1 and 4, inclusive.  If the specified
         COM port is not installed, MPt will not attempt to use it.  For
         information on COM port configurations, see Chapter 5, "The MPt
         Setup Program".


         -----------------------------------
         R+ or R-  (allow resumed transfers)
         -----------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, allows the MPt receiver to request a
         resumed transfer.  For example, if a file header is received for
         "foo.bar", and a file of the same name already exists in the
         receive path, MPt will check to see if it is shorter than the
         expected length.  If it is, a resume request will be sent, which
         will cause the transmitter to only send the remaining portion of
         the file.  This feature is useful for recovering from a lost
         carrier signal, or an abnormal amount of line noise.

         When this setting is disabled, MPt will not attempt to resume any
         transfers.  In this case, if a header for an existing file is
         received, MPt will check the "allow overwriting received files"
         setting before writing the new file to disk.

         Sx  (UART baud rate)
         --------------------
         When using this option, the "x" may be replaced by a numeric value
         between 0 and 115200, inclusive.  A non-zero value will adjust the
         UART baud rate to the specified value.  A value of zero will cause
         MPt to auto-detect and use the current UART baud rate when the
         MPt program is executed.


         * * * * * * * * * * * * UART Baud Rates * * * * * * * * * * * * *
         The UART is an integrated circuit that resides in a serial adaptor
         card, internal modem, or sometimes on the motherboard of your
         computer.  UART is an acronym for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-
         Transmitter.  This is a complicated way of saying "serial port".
         The serial port can communicate with external devices at various
         speeds, or baud rates.  The UART baud rate setting of MPt adjusts
         this speed.  If you're unsure about which value to use for the
         UART baud rate, try using the auto-detect value (0).  You may wish
         to consult your modem manual for more information about which baud
         rates can be used to communicate with your modem.

         --------------------------------------
         M+ or M-  (hangup modem when finished)
         --------------------------------------
         When this setting is enabled, MPt will lower the RTS and DTR
         signals at the end of the session.  Most modems can be configured
         to "hang up" when the DTR signal is lowered.

         When this setting is disabled, MPt will end with the RTS and DTR
         signals set high.


         --------------------------------------------
         W+ or W-  (wait for keystroke when finished)
         --------------------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, causes MPt to wait for a keystroke at
         the end of a transfer before returning to DOS.  If this setting is
         disabled, MPt will return control to DOS immediately after the
         session ends.


         ----------------------------------
         X+ or X-  (enable RLE compression)
         ----------------------------------
         This setting, when enabled, allows MPt to use RLE compression
         where possible when transferring data.

         If either end of the MPt connection (sender or receiver) disables
         this parameter, RLE compression will not be used.





                                                               Page 10




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         * * * * * * * * * * * * * RLE Compression * * * * * * * * * * * *
         MPt uses RLE compression techniques in an attempt to shorten
         blocks of data before they are transferred.  MPt will never
         transmit a compressed block of data unless the compressed block is
         shorter than the original block.

         The compression routines in MPt are written in Turbo Assembler,
         and are quite efficient.  However, at very high baud rates, when
         transferring pre-compressed files (such as those created by PKZIP)
         the overhead that is caused by MPt analyzing each block for
         compressibility can slow throughput slightly (especially on slower
         machines).  Therefore, RLE compression can be disabled to allow
         for the greatest possible throughput on compressed files at high
         baud rates.  Note that disabling RLE compression is typically only
         beneficial at baud rates above 9600 baud.  Even most slow machines
         are fast enough to analyze and output data with compression
         enabled at baud rates up to 9600 baud very efficiently.

                             SENDER FILE SPECIFICATIONS

         This version of the MPt Protocol is capable of sending
         up to 99 individual files in a single batch.  Each file which is
         transmitted by MPt is preceded by a header packet which contains
         the name of the file, its length, the original time and date
         stamp, and other control information.  The receiver reads these
         header packets to determine what the sender is transmitting.

         When invoking the sender command line, there are two distinct
         syntaxes for specifying files to transmit:

           MPT [options] s filespec [filespec] [filespec] [...]
           MPT [options] s @listfile

         In the first syntax, at least one file specification must be
         placed on the command line.  Additional file specifications may be
         placed after the first.  These file specifications may be actual
         filenames, including drive letter, and sub-directories, or may
         include wildcard characters (ie. *.*).  MPt will parse each
         wildcard specification into individual file names.  If more than
         99 files are specified, MPt will send the first 99 files found.

         In the second syntax, a single absolute file specification (no
         wildcards) is specified on the MPt command line, immediately
         preceded by the @ symbol.  MPt will read this file, expecting to
         find that it contains a list of file specifications (which may
         contain wildcard characters) each separated by CR/LF characters.
         For example, for the command line,

           MPT s @c:\file.lst

         A file named "file.lst" must be placed in the root directory of
         drive C, which contains a list of file specifications to send.



                                                               Page 11




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



                            RECEIVER FILE SPECIFICATIONS

         When receiving files with MPt, the syntax for the command line is
         as follows:

           MPT [options] r [path]

         The "path" portion is optional, and may be any single
         drive:\path\filename combination.

         The purpose of the "path" is to tell MPt where to place all the
         files it receives.  If a file name is specified in the "path"
         parameter, the file name portion will be ignored, because MPt
         determines file names from the information packet it receives for
         each file from the sender.  Therefore, when specifying only a path
         (no filename), this parameter MUST end with a backslash character
         (\).  For example, both of the following command lines are valid,
         and will cause the same result:

           MPT r c:\download\myfile.ext
           MPT r c:\download\

         Because the first command line has no terminating backslash on the
         path parameter, the "myfile.ext" portion will be ignored, and all
         received files will be placed in the "c:\download\" directory.

         MPt allows a file name to be specified only because certain
         calling programs insist on passing it along with the receive path.

         If more than one path specification appears on the MPt command
         line in receive mode, the first one following the "r" parameter
         will be used.  The remainder of the command line will be ignored.


                                     EXIT CODES

         When the MPt Protocol returns control to DOS at the end of a
         transfer, it will return a DOS exit code to the calling program.
         The following codes are returned by MPt:

           0  Transfer was completed successfully
           1  Transfer began, but ended without completing
           2  Session ended before transfer began

         __________________________________________________________________


         This chapter will familiarize you with the MPt display, and the
         meaning of each item shown during a MPt session.


                                    SCREEN ACCESS

         When MPt is executed, the first thing it does is to put up a full
         screen display.  If MPt is run under normal DOS conditions, all
         accesses to the screen will use direct memory access.  In other
         words, MPt will put updated screen information directly into the
         memory on board the resident display adaptor, bypassing the slow
         BIOS and DOS routines that are the alternatives to this technique.

         Since protocol programs are often used in multitasking
         environments, where direct video access can cause conflicts on a
         "shared" monitor, MPt offers an alternative.  When MPt is
         executed, the program checks for the presence of one of the
         following multitasking sub-systems:

                    DESQview    TaskView     OmniView     TopView
                          Microsoft Windows    IBM 3270 PC

         If one of these systems is active, and the Multitasking Video
         Buffers (MTVB) are enabled for the current process, MPt will
         direct all video access to the corresponding MTVB, instead of the
         physical memory on the display adaptor.  This technique allows for
         complete display compatibility with the above list of multitasking
         sub-systems.


                                       COLORS

         The color scheme of the MPt display can be easily customized for
         color or monochrome displays by using the MPt Setup program.  See
         Chapter 5, "The Setup Program", for more details.


                                   THE HELP SCREEN

         The help screen will appear when MPt is executed without any
         command line parameters.  It is always available for quick
         reference to command line syntaxes.  For detailed information
         about the options shown on the help screen, see Chapter 3, "The
         MPt Program".

                                     *    *    *

         When MPt is executed with command line parameters, a status
         display will appear, filling the screen with information
         concerning the status of each transfer.



                                                               Page 14

         The next few sections will explain the contents of each area of
         the display.


                                    BATCH STATUS

         This display area contains information on the entire batch
         transfer at hand.  On the left side of the Batch status window are
         totals for the batch, and an estimated time of transfer.  This is,
         as are all other estimates, based on the "effective baud rate",
         not the "UART baud rate".  See Chapter 3, "The MPt Program", for
         more information on baud rates.

         On the right side of the window are current values for the
         progress of the batch.  The Batch progress meter at the bottom
         reflects the percentage of completion for the entire batch.


                                 CURRENT FILE STATUS

         This display window contains information on the file which is
         currently being transferred.  Of particular interest in this
         window is the "Last message" item.  This is where all verbal
         messages are shown regarding MPt status.  Message descriptions are
         discussed below, in the section entitled, "Messages".


                                THROUGHPUT EFFICIENCY

         This window shows information concerning the estimated efficiency
         of the file transfer in progress.  The "Compression" item shows
         "RLE" if the current block of data is compressed, or "none" if it
         is a normal block of data.  This item may also show "disabled" if
         either end of the connection has specified the "X-" option on the
         command line, or disabled RLE compression using the setup program.

         The "Block size" meter reflects the length of the current block,
         from 64 bytes to 1024 (1K) bytes.

         Also shown in this window are average speed in characters per
         second, and an estimated efficiency in percentage of theoretical
         "maximum" efficiency.


                                        UART

         The UART status, or "modem light" display, gives the status of the
         signals that MPt uses on the serial port.








                                                               Page 15




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         At the top of the UART window is shown the type of UART that is
         installed in the COM port that MPt is using.  The recognized UARTs
         are:

           8250B  (INS8250 or INS8250-B)
           16450  (NS16450, NS16C450, NS8250A, or INS82C50A)
           16550  (NS16550)
           16550A (NS16550A, NS16550AF)

         MPt will optionally use FIFO buffers, if the "enable 16550A FIFO
         buffers" option is enabled, and the UART type is 16550A.
         See Chapter 3, "The MPt Program", for more information on using
         the FIFO buffers.

         The remainder of the UART display shows the status of the transmit
         line (TXD), the receive line (RXD), the carrier detect line (DCD),
         the clear to send line (CTS), and the request to send line (RTS).
         The indicator next to each item will light when the corresponding
         signal is high or active.


                                        STATS

         The stats window shows some miscellaneous information about
         options.  The indicator beside each item will normally be lit if
         the item is enabled, unless otherwise noted.  Following is a brief
         description of each item:

         Beep - status of the "beep upon completion (B+/-)" option.

         Date - status of the "stamp with current date (D+/-)" option.

         DCD  - status of the "monitor the carrier signal (N+/-)" option.

         Dele - status of the "delete aborted downloads (A+/-)" option.

         Hang - status of the "hangup modem when finished (M+/-)" option.

         FIFO - this indicator will be lit when FIFO buffers are used.

         Over - this indicator will be lit when the "allow overwriting
                received files (O+/-)" option is enabled.  If the MPt
                receiver actually overwrites a file, this indicator will
                blink for the remainder of the transfer of that particular
                file.

         Resu - this indicator will be lit when the "allow resumed
                transfers (R+/-)" option is enabled.  If the MPt receiver
                actually resumes a file, this indicator will blink for the
                remainder of the transfer of that particular file.







                                                               Page 16




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         Virt - this indicator will be lit if MPt is using an MTVB (virtual
                screen) for display access.  For more information on this
                item, see the section entitled, "Screen Access" near the
                beginning of this chapter.

         Wait - status of the "wait for keystroke when finished
                (W+/-)" option.


                                   DISPLAY FOOTER

         The footer line of the MPt display indicates miscellaneous items
         of interest.  We'll cover them from left to right, as displayed on
         the MPt screen:

         The far left section will contain "S" or "R", to indicate send or
         receive mode.

         Next is the COM port which MPt is using.

         The following two items are UART baud rate, labeled Ubps, and
         effective baud rate, labeled Ebps.  These values are shown in bits
         per second.

         Next is the handshaking indicator.  This will show the type of
         handshaking in use:

           N = None
           S = handshake slow
           D = handshake disk
           F = handshake fast

         Finally, on the far right, is the version number and User ID of
         the remote MPt Protocol driver.  This item will show "unknown"
         until synchronization has been established with the remote
         protocol.


                                      MESSAGES

         There are a number of messages which may be conveyed to the user
         by the MPt Protocol.  This section gives the most important
         messages and their meanings:

         SYNCHRONIZING
           MPt is attempting to communicate control information with the
           connecting protocol.  This occurs at the beginning of each file
           being transferred.

         SYNCHRONIZATION FAILED
           MPt was unable to synchronize with the connecting protocol.

         SENDING/RECEIVING FILE
           MPt is synchronized and has begun the file transfer.



                                                               Page 17




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         filename.ext DONE
           Transfer of "filename.ext" has completed successfully.

         filename.ext DELETED
           The partially received file, "filename.ext" has been deleted.
           This will only occur if the "delete aborted downloads" option is
           enabled.

         ERROR WRITING CDS/DSZ LOG FILE
           MPt had problems writing to a log file.

         ERROR AT BYTE xxxx: errortype
           This message indicates that MPt is attempting to recover from
           some type of line error.  The value of xxxx shows the byte
           position in the current file where the error occurred.  The
           errortype indicates what caused the error.  There are seven
           causes for line errors:

             CRC       - MPt detected an error when comparing CRCs.  This
                         is usually causes by line noise on a bad
                         connection.

             Long      - The MPt receiver received a block longer than 1K
                         in length.  This is typically a result of line
                         noise "adding" spurious garbage characters into
                         the bit stream.

             Short     - The MPt receiver got a partial block, which was
                         not complete.

             Duplicate - The MPt receiver received a block of data that had
                         already been received successfully.

             Waiting -   The MPt receiver is waiting for the next logical
                         block in the sequence.

             Timeout -   The receiver has not received a block of data
                         within a reasonable time frame.

             Overrun -   The MPt receiver has experienced a UART buffer
                         overrun error.  This is usually caused by slow
                         receiver CPU's at high baud rates, slow disk BIOS
                         or drivers, or multitasking receiving computers
                         without a 16550A UART.  For information on
                         correcting this problem, see Chapter 3.

         ERROR READING FILE: filename.ext
           The MPt sender could not read the current file from disk.

         CANCELLED BY SENDER/RECEIVER
           The transfer was cancelled by the other end of the connection.

         CANCELLED
           The transfer has been cancelled locally by pressing the ESC key.



                                                               Page 18

         CARRIER LOST
           The DCD signal was lowered during the transfer.  This will only
           be reported if the "monitor the carrier signal" option is
           enabled.

         FATAL TIMEOUT
           The sender received no response from the receiver within a
           reasonable amount of time.

         TOO MANY ERRORS
           More than twenty consecutive line errors occurred during the
           transfer.

         NOT ALLOWED TO OVERWRITE FILE
           The receiver got a file header for an existing file, and the
           "allow overwriting received files" option is disabled.

         CAN'T CREATE FILE
           The receiver can't create the file to be received.

         CAN'T WRITE TO DISK
           The receiver can't write received information to the disk file.

                                  *       *       *

         The following messages can occur only before the transfer begins,
         and will cause an ERRORLEVEL 2 to be returned to DOS.

         INVALID REGISTRATION INFORMATION
           The MPT.EXE file contains an invalid UserID/Serial number
           combination.

         INVALID PARAMETER: xx
           An invalid parameter (xx) has been given on the command line.

         INVALID SPEED: xxxxx
           An invalid speed (baud rate) has been specified.

         INVALID HANDSHAKING
           An invalid handshaking option has been specified.

         INVALID PORT: x
           An invalid COM port has been specified.  This will occur if MPt
         cannot identify an active UART in the specified port.

         SEND/RECEIVE NOT SPECIFIED
           The "s" or "r" parameter was not given on the command line.

         ERROR READING LIST FILE
           The MPt sender could not read the specified list file
           (@listfile).

           MPt could not locate the file filename.ext as specified in a
           list file, or on the command line.

         NO FILES SPECIFIED
           The MPt sender found no file specifications on the command line
           or in a list file.

         __________________________________________________________________


         Accompanying the MPt Protocol program is a setup program called
         MPTSET.EXE, which allows the user to customize MPt.  The setup
         program accomplishes this by reading the MPT.EXE file, which must
         reside in the default directory, and updating it with the custom
         setup information.

         Using the MPTSET program is easy.  First, log to the directory
         where the MPT.EXE file resides.  This can be done in DOS by using
         the "chdir" or "cd" command.

         Next, execute the MPTSET.EXE program.  This program can reside
         anywhere on your hard disk, or on a floppy disk.

         The setup program will first attempt to read the MPT.EXE file.  If
         it is not present in the current directory, or is somehow
         corrupted, you will be alerted.

         When the MPT.EXE file has been found and read successfully, you
         will be presented with the setup program's main menu.


                                      MAIN MENU

         The main menu contains the following information:

           -> Change default options
              Adjust screen colors
              Install registration information
              Quit and save settings

         From here, you have four options from which to choose.  You may
         select an option by moving the arrow that is shown on the screen
         to point at the option you wish to select.  The up and down arrow
         keys move the arrow.  Press Enter to choose the selected item.
         From the main menu, you may also press the ESC key.  The results
         of this action are the same as selecting the "Quit and save
         settings" option.


                               CHANGE DEFAULT OPTIONS

         After selecting this item, you will be presented with a screen
         showing a number of options and their current defaults, as they
         are currently set in the MPT.EXE file.

         An explanation of each of these options is detailed in Chapter 3,
         so we won't repeat ourselves in this section.

         A few things to note about setting options:

           The UART baud rate - When choosing a UART baud rate, the setting
           "Current" will cause MPt to use the baud rate at which the UART
           is operating when the program is executed.

           The Effective baud rate - The setting "UART" will cause MPt to
           match the effective baud rate to the UART baud rate when MPt is
           executed.

           IRQs and Base addresses - The IRQ settings adjust the hardware
           interrupt for each COM port.  The base address settings adjust
           the base I/O address where the UART is mapped for each COM port.
           Base addresses must be entered in hex format.  These settings
           allow customization of non-standard COM ports.  See your
           internal modem or serial port manual for more information on
           IRQs and Base address settings.

           The CDS and DSZ log files - These settings allow default log
           files to be specified.

         All default settings except for COM port base addresses and IRQs
         can be overrided by using command line parameters when executing
         MPt.


                                ADJUST SCREEN COLORS

         Selecting this item causes a portion of the MPt Status screen to
         be shown, along with a menu of items that can be colorized.  Using
         the up and down arrow keys, you can position the arrow to point to
         an item to be adjusted.  The following keys affect the "selected"
         item:

           Enter - changes the foreground color
           Space - changes the background color
           ESC   - return to main menu

         The following two keys affect the entire display:

           C     - select default color scheme
           M     - select monochrome scheme


                          INSTALL REGISTRATION INFORMATION

         This item allows registered MPt users to install their User ID and
         serial number.  For information on registering, please read the
         file, LICENSE.TXT.

         A note to registered MPt (or Puma) users:

         When you receive your User ID and serial number in the mail, you
         can use the "Install registration information" option to install



                                                               Page 22

         the information into MPT.EXE.

         When typing the UserID, you may use mixed upper and lower case
         letters, all CAPS, or all lower case, whichever you desire.

         Enter the serial number EXACTLY as it is shown on your
         registration certificate.  MPt will not run with improper User ID
         or serial number information.  If you receive the message,
         "Invalid registration information" when running MPt, double check
         the ID and serial number on your certificate with the information
         entered into MPTSET.EXE.

         Registered Lynx Users:

         You may use the LYNX_MPT.EXE program to extract the registration
         information from LYNX.EXE for use with The MPt Protocol.

         You must first place your REGISTERED LYNX.EXE file into the
         current directory, and then execute the LYNX_MPT.EXE program.
         Follow screen instructions for more details.


                               QUIT AND SAVE SETTINGS

         This option causes MPTSET to prompt you for a response:

           Save new settings in MPT.EXE <Y or N> ?

         Responding with "N" will cause MPTSET to end without updating
         MPT.EXE.

         Responding with "Y" will cause MPTSET to end after writing the new
         setup information into the MPT.EXE file.


                                    *     *     *


         When running MPt after using MPTSET, note that the "Stats" window
         will reflect the default settings that you have specified.  These
         defaults can be overrided by command line parameters.

         This chapter is dedicated to the people who made the MPt project
         possible, including all the users who registered as Lynx Protocol
         users, all those who helped test Lynx and MPt, and those who
         contributed in other ways. . .


                                       INSIDE

         A large percentage of the development time on MPt was spent coding
         and tuning the UART interface routines using Turbo Assembler 1.0.
         Repeated tests have revealed that MPt operates quite reliably on a
         115200 baud direct link between an 8 Mhz 80286 and a 12 Mhz 80286,
         even with a 16450 UART.  Hats off to Borland International for a
         fine assembler!

         The remainder of the project was coded in Turbo Pascal 5.5,
         Borland's award-worthy compiler and development system.

         The speed of the display in MPt is attributed to the QWIK toolbox
         from Eagle Performance Software - QWIK is an irreplaceable kit
         full of goodies that makes programming without the CRT unit a
         genuine pleasure.  Good work, Eagle!

         TheDraw from TheSoft Programming Services was used to develop
         everything visual in the MPt software package.  TheDraw proved to
         be an invaluable tool for designing the user displays.  Kudos to
         Mr. Ian Davis for his quality screen design software!

         The MPt Protocol is distributed in ZIPPED format, a technology
         made possible by the wonderful PKZIP shareware product from
         PKWARE, Inc.  Thanks to Mr. Phil Katz for a top-notch shareware
         product!

                                       OUTSIDE

         MPt has made it to the Shareware marketplace only after very
         extensive testing by the author, and by these fine people, who
         kindly volunteered their testing services:

            Nick Anis            Kevin Bass         Mike Callahan

                               ENHANCED DSZ LOG FORMAT

         The Enhanced DSZ logging that MPt uses is provided for some
         compatibility with programs that recognize this type of logging.

         The log file consists of a single line of text for each file
         transferred.  Following is a sample entry:

         S 217837 57600 bps 5050 cps   0 errors     0 1024 MPT110.ZIP MPt

         The format of each field in this entry is as follows, beginning
         with the leftmost field:

           - 'S' for send, 'R' for receive, 'E' for aborted transfer, or
             'L' for lost carrier.

           - The length of the file, in bytes.

           - The effective baud rate.  MPt follows the DSZ format of using
             '65535' to represent an actual baud rate of 115200.

           - The average transfer rate, in characters per second.

           - The total number of errors which occurred during transmission.

           - The number of flow control restrictions, as specified in the
             DSZ documentation.  MPt does not record this value, so this
             field will always contain a zero.

           - The length of the last block transferred in the file.

           - The name of the file which was transferred.

           -*The name of the protocol used.

           -*The last field is either empty, or contains '(resumed)' to
             signify that the file was resumed.

         * These fields are not part of the original DSZ specification.


                                 CDS LOG FORMAT

         CDS logging is a standard of recording online activities of all
         types.  It was developed in an attempt to standardize the
         interface between various communication utilities, such as
         terminal emulators, BBS software, external protocols (such as
         MPt), and phone bill analyzers.





                                                               Page 26




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         By supporting CDS logging, MPt's activities can be tracked by any
         utility that will read a CDS file.

         Following is an example of a CDS log entry made by MPt:


         90-01-04 00:46:11 020 MPt
                 COM port 1
                 Comm parameters 2400 8 N 1
                 Sent file AUTOEXEC.BAT
                 File size 142
                 Protocol MPt
                 Ended 90-01-04 00:46:11 (call ended abruptly)
                 Transfer Errors 1
                 Efficiency 0.0 %
                 Average CPS 0


         The first line is the record header, which gives the date and time
         the transfer began, the record number (020), which identifies the
         record as a file transfer entry, and 'MPt', the name of the
         program that created the entry.

         Following the header are single-line entries describing the
         transfer:

         COM port N

           The communications port used for the transfer.  N will have a
           value from 1 to 4.

         Comm parameters 2400 8 N 1

           Designates the effective baud rate, data bits, parity check, and
           stop bits during a transfer.  Each parameter is separated by a
           space.  MPt always uses '8 N 1' for data type.

         Sent file FILENAME
         Rcvd file FILENAME

           The name of the transferred file.

         File size NNN

           The size of the transferred file.  NNN is the size in bytes (not
           kilobytes).

         Protocol MPt

           The file transfer protocol used.







                                                               Page 27




          The MPt Protocol v1.10                              User's Manual



         Ended YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
         Ended YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (aborted by sender)
         Ended YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (aborted by receiver)
         Ended YY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (call ended abruptly)

           Tells when the transfer terminated, and shows if the sender or
           receiver aborted the transfer, or if the carrier signal was
           lost (call ended abruptly).

         Transfer Errors NNN

           Provides the total number of errors encountered during the
           transfer.  If the entry is missing, no errors occurred during
           the transfer.

         Efficiency NNN %

           Provides the efficiency of the  file transfer.  "NNN" is the
           efficiency as a percentage ("96.2 %" for example).

         Average CPS NNNN

           Provides  the average characters transmitted per second for the
           file.  "NNNN" is the CPS average as a whole number, "239" for
           example.

         MPt has a feature that allows the sending protocol to alert the
         receiver to start download synchronization.  This can decrease the
         number of required keystrokes to start a download.

         At this time, none of the terminal programs that were evaluated by
         the author directly support any type of auto-receive mode for
         external protocols, other than Zmodem.

         It may be possible for some terminals to support MPt auto-receive
         by using their built-in script language to wait for the MPt auto-
         packet, and then beginning the external MPt receiver protocol.

         Following is the format of the MPt auto-packet, which the MPt
         sender transmits at one-second intervals at the beginning of a
         batch transfer:

         Turbo Pascal format:
           #24#8#24#8#24'MPt '#24#8#24#8#24

         When this string of characters is received during a terminal
         session, the MPt receive protocol should be initiated.

         Perhaps we will see this type of feature supported in future
         releases of the popular terminal programs.  But for now, it has to
         be done using scripts.

         The following revisions have been made to the MPt Protocol
         Software package:

         v1.00 (01-15-90)

         This was the initial release of the protocol.  The name of the
         software was "Puma" in its first release.


         v1.10 (08-07-90)

         This release was made only to change the name of the protocol to
         "The MPt Protocol", due to a trademark problem with the previous
         name.
