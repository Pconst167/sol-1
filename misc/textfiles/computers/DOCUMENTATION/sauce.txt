   Recipe for SAUCE

   Chef cuisinier : Tasmaniac / ACiD
   Maitre d'h“tel : Rad Man / ACiD

        ANSi's used to be just ANSi's,  pictures  were just pictures,
   loaders were just loaders  and quite frankly,  every file was just
   as plain tasting as every  other.  This  is  about to change, how-
   ever,  because  ACiD  has decided to give  their  files  an  extra
   "je-ne-sais-quoi."  In  reality,  we'll  be  adding SAUCE to every
   file you can imagine.

        Now, before we thoroughly confuse you, let us explain what we
   are doing  here.  SAUCE  stands  for  "Standard  Architecture  for
   Universal  Comment  Extensions."  Although originally intended for
   personal use in ANSi's and RIP screens,  early in the developement
   of EFI (Extended File Information) it  was decided that EFI should
   be extended  to  have  support  for  more  than  just ANSi and RIP
   screens.  Our brainchild  was  born  and  the specs were designed.
   The only aspect left  undecided was the name,  and after rejecting
   some very funny candidates,  SAUCE  was  unanimously chosen.  This
   leads us to the big question in the sky,  "What is sauce?"   SAUCE
   is a universal process to incorporate  a  full description for any
   type of file.  The most outstanding aspect of this concept is that
   you have access to the complete file name,  the file's title,  the
   creation date, the creator of the file, the group that the creator
   is employed by, and much, much, more.

        Let us begin with a description  of  the record layouts used.
   The record layouts and code  examples  are  in  a  variated pascal
   pseudo code, and should  be  transferrable  enough to implement in
   most  other  programming  languages.  For  ease  of  reading,  the
   examples assume  that  the  file  is  correct  and  that no error-
   checking need be included.  How  rigorous  you check for errors is
   completely up to you, and will most likely depend on the file type
   you are describing.


   SAUCE RECORD
   ------------

        This portion of the documentation  is about the SAUCE record.
   The SAUCE record describes the  file  in short, and provides other
   information not included in the SAUCE record itself.

   A sauce record is _EXACTLY_ 128 bytes in size.

   Fieldname   : Name of the field.
   Size        : Size of the field in BYTES
   Type        : Type of data. This can be :
     BYTE      : One byte unsigned numeric value (0 to 255)
     WORD      : Two byte unsigned numeric value (0 to 65535)
     INTEGER   : Two byte signed numeric value (-32768 to 32767)
     LONG      : Four byte signed numeric value (-2147483648 to 2147483647)
     CHARACTER : One byte ASCII value.  Longer character fields are
                 padded with spaces.  It is _NOT_ a PASCAL string (with a
                 leading length byte), and it's _NOT_ a C-Style string
                 (with a trailing nul-byte).  A 10 byte character field
                 holding the text 'ANSI' would look like this.
                 'ANSI      '.
   
        Numeric fields should be zero when not used, character fields
   should be all spaces when not used.
   
    V#          : SAUCE Version number.  This indicates the version of
                  SAUCE when the field was implemented.

    Description : Complete description of the field.

    ID          5  Character 00 SAUCE Identification. This should be equal to
                                'SAUCE' or the record is not a valid SAUCE
                                record.

                                specifications of SAUCE, this version number
                                will change.  Future versions SHOULD remain
                                compatible with version 00 only ADDING on
                                the specifications, it is however not unlikely
                                that this compatibility is impossible to
                                maintain, but this is of no concern now.
    Title      35  Character 00 Title of the file.

    Date        8  Character 00 Date the file was created. This date is in
                                the format CCYYMMDD (Century, year, month,
                                day).  There is a good reason why the date
                                is in this format, but it's not used in
                                version '00' of SAUCE.  It will be used in
                                a future version of SAUCE.
    FileSize    4  Long      00 Original filesize NOT including any

                                When used, this field holds informative
                                values.  Any program using SAUCE should not
                                rely on these values being correct or filled
                                in.

    Flags       2  Word    * 00 Flags indication optional settings/switches
                                These flags have different meaning depending
                                on the data type.
                                The flags weren't originally in the concept
                                for Version 00 of SAUCE. but since the
                                specification of SAUCE expects all filler
                                bytes to be binary zero, the flags should be
                                set to ZERO in all previous files, and cause
                                no significant harm.


    An Example PASCAL record looks like this:

      TYPE SAUCERec = RECORD
                        ID       : Array[1..5] of Char;
                        Version  : Array[1..2] of Char;
                        Title    : Array[1..35] of Char;
                        Author   : Array[1..20] of Char;
                        Group    : Array[1..20] of Char;
                        Date     : Array[1..8] of Char;
                        FileSize : Longint;
                        DataType : Byte;
                        FileType : Byte;
                        TInfo1   : Word;
                        TInfo2   : Word;
                        TInfo3   : Word;
                        TInfo4   : Word;
                        Comments : Byte;
                        Flags    : Byte;
                        Filler   : Array[1..22] of Char;
                      END;

    An Example C record looks like this:

      typedef SAUCEREC {
         char          ID[5];
         char          Version[2];
         char          Title[35];
         char          Author[20];
         char          Group[20];
         char          Date[8];
         signed long   FileSize;
         unsigned char DataType;
         unsigned char FileType;
         unsigned int  TInfo1;
         unsigned int  TInfo2;
         unsigned int  TInfo3;
         unsigned int  TInfo4;
         unsigned char Flags;
         char          Filler[22];
      } SAUCEREC;


    DATATYPES
    ---------
        DataType and FileType hold the information needed to deter-
    mine what type of file it is.

    There are 5 DataTypes, these are (with their respective numeric values) :
      0) None      : Undefined filetype, you could use this to add SAUCE
                     information to personal datafiles needed by programs,
                     but not having any other meaning.
      1) Character : Any character based file.  Examples are ASCII, ANSi and
                     RIP.
      2) Graphics  : Any bitmap graphic file.  Examples are GIF, LBM, and
                     PCX.
      3) Vector    : Any vector based graphic file.  Examples are DXF and
                     CAD files.
      4) Sound     : Any sound related file.  Examples are samples, MOD
                     files and MIDI.
      5) BinaryText: This is RAW memory copy of a text screen.  It's
                     basically the BIN format you can save from whitin
                     TheDraw.  Each character is built up of two consecutive
                     bytes.  The first is the character to be displayed.  The
                     second is the Attribute byte.


     None
     ----
     When using the 'None' datatype, you should have FileType set to
     zero also.  This is a compatibility issue as it's not unlikely,
     the 'None' datatype will have filetypes in the future.

     Character
     ---------
     When using the 'Character' datatype, you have following filetypes
     available :

      0) ASCII     : Plain text file with no formatting codes or color codes.
                     TInfo1 is used for the width of the file.
                     TInfo2 is used to hold the number of lines in the file.
      1) ANSi      : ANSi file.  With ANSi color codes and cursor
                     positioning.
                     TInfo1 is used for the width of the file.
                     TInfo2 is used to hold the number of ANSi screen lines
                     in the file.
      2) ANSiMation: ANSi Animation.  With ANSi color codes and cursor
                     positioning.  While an ANSi file can also have animated
                     sequences, there is a clear distinction.  While an ANSi
                     may or may not have a beginning animated sequence
                     introducing the group or artist the rest is just a
                     sequence of colored characters.  An ANSiMation on the
                     other hand is a more like a text mode cartoon.
                     TInfo1 is used for the width of the file.
                     TInfo2 is used to hold the number of ANSi screen lines
                     the ANSiMation was created for.
                     A program using SAUCE may use these two values to
                     switch to the appropriate video mode.
      3) RIP       : Remote Imaging Protocol (RIP) graphics file.
                     TInfo1 holds the width (should be 640)
                     TInfo2 holds the height (should be 350)
                     TInfo3 holds the number of colors (should be 16)
      4) PCBoard   : File with PCBoard style @X color codes and @ macro's
                     and ANSi codes.
                     TInfo1 is used for the width of the file.
                     TInfo2 is used to hold the number of ANSi screen lines
                     in the file.
      5) AVATAR    : A file with AVATAR and ANSi color codes and cursor
                     positioning.

      All non-used bits should be ZERO.

      A) Non-Blink mode (iCE Color).
         When this bit is SET (equal to 1) The ANSi is created using iCE
         color codes.  This is a special mode where the blinking is
         disabled, and you have 16 background colors available.  Basically,
         you have the same choice for background colors as for foreground
         colors.

         Please note:

         When the picture does not make specific use of the iCE color, you
         should NOT have this bit set.  When you do not support the iCE
         color mode, you should probably not display the file as it could
         look pretty weird in normal mode.

     Graphics
     --------
     For all graphics types, TInfo1 holds width of the image, TInfo2
     holds the Height of the image and TInfo3 holds the number of bits
     per pixel (a 256 colour image would have 8 bits per pixel, a
     TrueColor image would have 24);

     FLAGS

     Not used, should be all zeroes.

     BinaryText
     ----------
     The Binary Text format, basically has no Filetype, since the datatype
     has already defined how the file will look.
     The FileType however specifies the WIDTH of the BinaryText screen.
     Only the Width is required, as the Height can be calculated by dividing
     the filesize by the Width.
     In an attempt to provide as much WIDTH as possible in a possible 256
     values of the Byte-sized FileType.  The width is specified in Multiples
     of 2.  The fact that the Width is specified in multiples of 2 isn't
     really a problem, since you also need to define the effective screen
     size in multiples of 2.

     An example : For normal 80*25 binary images as made with TheDraw the
                  FileType value would be 40 (since 2*40 equals 80 <g>)
                  All you need to do is divide the width of the binary text
                  image by 2. This gives a maximum width of 510 characters.
                  Although currently not supported, should there be a need
                  for even bigger images, this can be arranged.

     Please note.  BinaryText expects the character-attribute pairs to be
     stored one row at a time.  If you wanted to create a 80*100 Image, you
     could do this by just copying 4 80*25 or 2 80*50 together to form one
     bigger image.
     If for example you wanted to create a 160*25 image from 2 80*25 images,
     you would need to write a little program which would copy line 1 from
     image 1, line 1 from image 2, Line 2 from Image 1, Line 2 from Image 2
     and so on.
     Basically, you should have all character-attribute pairs from one line
     of the COMPLETE image one after the other, followed by all
     char-attribute pairs from the next row, and so on.

     If the picture does not fit this format. You should use the NONE
     datatype.  Besides.  you'd probably want to have it in this format
     anyway, as it seems to be the most logical approach to have these kind
     of images.

      All non-used bits should be ZERO.

      A) Non-blink mode (iCE Color).
         This bit has exactly the same meaning as for the Character
         datatype.  It indicates whether the picture uses iCE color.


    COMMENTS
    --------
        The  comment  block  is an addition to the SAUCE  record.  It
    holds up to  255  lines of additional information.  Each  line 64
    characters wide.

        When the Comments field is not  zero,  it holds the number of
    additional comment lines are available.  A single comment line is
    64 characters  long.  Like  the character  fields  in  the  SAUCE
    record, it is padded with spaces,  and has no leading length byte
    or trailing null-byte.

        The comment block is  preceded  with  a 5 character identifi-
    cation mark.  This identification mark is 'COMNT'.

    EXAMPLE CODE TO READ SAUCE
    --------------------------
    Variables:
      Byte : Count;
      Long : FileSize;
      file : F;

    Code:
      Open_File(F);                         | Open the file for read access
      FileSize = Size_of_file(F);           | Determine filesize
      Seek_file (F, FileSize-128);          | Seek to start of SAUCE (Eof-128)
      Read_File (F, SAUCE);                 | Read the SAUCE record
      IF SAUCE.ID="SAUCE" THEN              | ID bytes match "SAUCE" ?
         IF SAUCE.Comments>0 THEN           | Is there a comment block ?

                                            | Seek to start of Comment block.
            Read_File(F, CommentID);        | Read Comment ID.
            IF CommentID="COMNT" THEN       | Comment ID matches "COMNT" ?
               For Count=1 to SAUCE.Comments| \ Read all comment lines.
