    Welcome to TinyView (called TV from here on)!  This program is the best
    text file viewer your ever going to see.  It's tiny (958 bytes), it can
    view ANY size text file,  it displays lines up to 1024 characters wide,
    and it uses all 25 lines of your display.   How does TV do all of this?
    Through the magic of assembler.   This  program is written in 100% pure
    assembly language for the smallest, fastest program possible.  When you
    want to view a file you type:

    TV filename.ext  (Paths and drive letters are fully supported)

   ³ HOW TO USE TV ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    After  TV  loads  your file you will be presented with a FULL screen of
    data WITHOUT any kind of status  line to clutter up your display.   How
    do you go up and down through the file you ask?   You use the keys that
    would make the most sense, of course!  The keys that TV uses are:

    PgUp - Go up 1 page
    PgDn - Go down 1 page
    Home - Go to the top of the file
    End  - Go to the end of the file
        - Move up one line
        - Move down one line
    ->   - Move screen right 10 columns
    <-   - Move screen back to left margin
    ESC  - Quit TV and exit to DOS

   ³ HIDDEN GOODIES ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    Just because TV is small doesn't mean it's not potent.   (Have  any  of
    you  ladies  heard  a  guy say that lately?).   TV filters and properly
    displays ALL 256 characters from the IBM character set.   Who cares you
    say?   You would if TV  didn't  do  that.    You  see,  some of the IBM
    character set can produce "strange"  results  if  your  viewer  doesn't
    properly  handle  the character.   Try using TV on a file that contains
    the ASCII character number 9 (TAB), 10 (line feed), or a 12 (form feed)
    and see what happens.   Now, use your file viewer and see what happens.
    That's when you'll really appreciate the "hidden goodies" of TV!

   ³ FINAL NOTES ³
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    One final note:  TV is to be considered a Public Domain program.   What
    does  that  mean?    It  means that you can freely give this program to
    anyone who wants a copy.   As a  matter of fact I encourage you to give
    this program to everyone, whether or not they want it (grin)!  The only
    stipulation to this offer is this:  you must include  the  file  TV.DOC
    with evey copy of TV.COM that you give away.  Not too tough, huh?

    So use it, give it away, and enjoy it!
    (Hey, I'm talking about my program - Get your mind out of the gutter!!)
