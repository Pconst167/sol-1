**Introduction:

Starburst Maintenance Program is being distributed under the Shareware
distribution system.  

Starburst Maintenance Program is a growing program or project.  You may
find sections that do not run, or reports that are not in place.  This
is not a hold out, I have been working on this project for three years
and this is where I am at the time of this release. 

Copies of this program may be made and shared, as long as no fee is   
charged, other than a nominal fee for material. You have the opportunity
to try the program for free or at a minimum cost,if the program does not
meet your needs you are out only the time to try it out. However if it
saves you thousands of dollars of maintenance down time, then it would
be practical for you or your company to support this type of software.
The only way the SHAREWARE concept will work is if users support the  
author and the programs.

By registering this program with the author you will support its      
continuing growth. And you will receive the latest revision, and 
major updates for the next two years, with a minumum of at least
two (2) major updates. Also user support by mail and in emergency
by phone ( in the evening or weekends only ).                         

The registration fee is $49.00; add $3.00 sales tax if in Ohio and    
$5.00 postage for overseas and/or air mail.                           

This Maintenance Program is in three main sections. These sections are
Preventive Maintenance, Corrective Maintenance and Utilities.

PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE is an easy to use tool that quickly reduces 
maintenance cost for any size company.  By using the weekly 
generated reports maintenance items will not be over looked or 
skipped.  Maintenance items that are done once a week or once 
every three years will be done with no thought from management.  
For example; how long has it been since the EXIT door lights have 
been checked for operation.  How often has an oil sump run dry, a 
cable failed due to poor lubrication, an OSHA required report 
been neglected, production shut-down for the same failure that 
could be prevented with a time changed item.  Every time you have 
a break-down; think "Would I have this problem if someone had 
looked at it, oiled it, filled it, tested it, changed it or tuned 
it last week".  If the answer is, "NO, I would not have the 
problem", then enter the item into the PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE 
work order file and the chances are slim that the problem will 
ever reoccur.

CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE is used to track time and cost of corrective
maintenance.  How often have you wished you knew how many times
the machine had the same failure. Or what has been the total cost 
keep an old junker running. Also how long did it take to fix it,
and what material was used. What is an accurate estimate to repair
it this time ? 

UTILITIES are use by both sections so that data does not need to be
entered more than once. Other services provided in Utilities are
Back Up Data, Re_Index Files, Install, Erase all Files, Color and
Set Date Format


**SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS


-An IBM PC or compatible

-A monochrome or color monitor with 80 column display.
 A  color graphics board is not necessary,  but if you have one,  
 the  set up program will ask you to indicate it.

-A 370 K disk drive or hard disk.

-An 8 1/2 x 11 printer.

**GETTING SETUP

1. The first thing you will want to do is make a backup copy.  Do not
   use this master as a working disk.  Also make a copy to give to a
   friend. 

2. Your boot disk or drive must have a program called CONFIG.SYS
   
   A.  If you do not have a program called CONFIG.SYS on your boot disk
       or hard drive copy the one from the Maintenance disk onto the boot
       disk or hard drive.

   B.  If you do have CONFIG.SYS, check to see that it calls for at
       least 14 files and 20 buffers.  To check:
          a.   Turn on or re-boot the computer
          b.   At the prompt enter  { X:> TYPE CONFIG.SYS }.
               You should see on any two lines:
                 FILES=14
                 BUFFERS=20
          c.  If not, the file can be modified with a Word Processor
              in "non-document" mode or with your DOS EDLIN.  This
              will only help your computer run better and will not
              effect other programs.

3. Hard disk installation.

   A. Copy the disk into a sub-directory on your hard disk.
      COPY *.* C:\{sub}

   B. From that sub-directory enter or run MAINT.

   C. The screen will clear, Then say loading MAINT.EXE.  The logo
      will appear and then the date menu.  Enter the correct date.
      At this point a light bar menu will appear.  On all light bar
      menus you may use the arrow keys and enter or the first letter
      or number or letter of the selected line.  Select "UTILITY".

   D. From the next or Utility Menu select - "3. Install".

   E. Fill in the blanks on the form.  The most important question
      is the one on DATA storage.  You must indicate the drive letter,
      A, B, C, D, OR E where the files are stored. Note: A_INITAL.DBF
      must be on the same drive and sub-directory as MAINT.EXE. All
      the other files may be saved on the hard drive or a floppy.
   
   F. Next, from the Utility Menu select - 4. Erase all the files.
      This removes old data and resets the file pointers and indexes.
   
   G. If you are not in the U.S.A. select -5. Set DATE format. This
      allows for dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy etc.

   H. Enter 9 to return to the Main Menu

4. Floppy disk installation.

   A. For best results the program and files should be on separate
      floppy disks.  Only one disk drive is required. 

      a. Disk #1      COPY
         COPY MAINT.EXE B:
         COPY A_INITAL.DBF B:

      b. Disk # 2     COPY
         COPY *.DBF B:

   B. From DRIVE A: ENTER or run MAINT.

   C. The screen will clear, Then say loading MAINT.EXE.  The logo
      will appear and then the date menu.  Enter the correct date.
      At this point a light bar menu will appear.  On all light bar
      menus you may use the arrow keys and enter or the first letter
      or number on the selected line.  Select "UTILITY".
      

   D. From the next or Utility Menu select "INSTALL".

   E. Fill in the blanks on the form.  The most important question
      is the one on DATA storage.  You must indicate the drive letter,
      A, B, C, D, OR E where the files are stored.
   
      Put Disk #2 in drive A: if you have only one disk drive.

   F. Next, from the Utility Menu select - "4. Erase all the files".
      This removes old data and resets the file pointers and indexes.
   
   G. If you are not in the U.S.A. select -"5. Set DATE format". This
      allows for dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy etc.

   H. Enter 9 to return to the Main Menu

**Getting  started

1. Now from the Main Menu run Machine Data.  This is not the fun part of 
   program.  For now enter machine number, name, location, department.
   (Reports using other data have not been written).  This data will be
   used on all work orders and does not have to be re-entered.

2. From the Main Menu run Category, the default categories are shown.
   You may change them to anything you like.  Some change them to dept's.
   or buildings etc.

3. Now run Labor, and enter up to 10 (0-9) labor grades. (Not used yet).

4. The DATE format was set in the Install program.  This may be changed
   at any time.  When you change it all stored dates will change too.

8. It is suggested that you run DUE work orders once each week, but that
   is up to you.  Running Due work orders will print out Work Orders
   for any tasks that are due.  If it is due once a year it will print
   once a year, and only once a year.

9. As work orders are completed Post the File Number, not Index Number 
   to close. You may print out all work orders that have not been closed
   if you need duplicates.

10.After selecting Edit you will be ask for the file index number.
   This the sequential number assigned by the program, which you can 
   find on the top line of any of the printed reports.

   The update screen is the same as above. Entering a blank will
   return you to the Main Menu.

11.Selecting List All PM WO's will result in a report of all work orders 
   in the file.  You may select the printing sequence:

                    1.   FILE INDEX
                    2.   MACHINE NUMBER
                    3.   CATEGORY

12.List All Due WO's - This is the print out that you are looking for.
   This printing list each work order that is due or overdue, leaving
   room for remarks and a place to sign off the work. As the list is
   printed all files are updated to the calendar.  It is suggested that
   this LISTING be run once a week otherwise the work load in one 
   category may be to great.  



Corrective Maintenance:

1. This program tracts corrective maintenance cost for each machine.
   The files will hold as many records as you have disk space.

2. From the Corrective Menu, enter Corrective W.O.

3. Enter the machine number as before.

4. Enter a description of the work that is to be done.

5. Using the Report Menu print the work order.

6. Follow up by entering labor hours worked, parts and material, and
   a description of the corrective action.

**More to come:
 
As you can see there is a lot of room for more.  Reports will be added
programs will be expanded and corrected.  Please send suggestion and
errors found in the program to Starburst Software.


A note to current registered users of PM MAINT:

Thanks for your support and help.  This program is more than an up-date,
it is entirely new. It is written in a different language, the old was
Basic, the new is DBase III.  It is much faster ( it will sort several
hundred files in a minute or two while the old  took 10 or more minutes.
Also the old held only 400 files, the new holds 9999 and if someone
needs more it can be increased to 99999. And it has a new look with
light bar menus, framing, date format, color and more. 

Now the bad news, the files are DBase not Basic and the data will not
transfer. If you don't feel the good is stronger, stay with the old.
For any one who does not have Revision 1.40, it is on the disk.
