      What is PALERT
      --------------

      PALERT is a utility program to help you avoid unexpectedly
      running out of disk space and/or memory.  Many times application
      programs terminate abnormally or disallow you from completing a
      function because of insufficient disk space or memory.
      Sometimes, this may cause you to lose valuable work time and
      sometimes causes data to be lost. PALERT watches your disk space
      and warns you when space is getting low.

      PALERT lets you specify your disk space needs and then watches
      the disk until that limit is reached.  It then warns you of
      the situation and lets you take appropriate action.  PALERT
      is implemented as a standard DOS command that may be used
      by itself or from a DOS batch command file.

      Implement PALERT before starting any application or program
      where sufficient disk space is critical.  PALERT will save
      you time and money.

      Features:
      컴컴컴컴

        **  Checks disk space whenever you want to.

        **  Checks available memory

        **  Can trigger other commands based on insufficient
            disk space and/or memory

        **  Many features to customize messages and actions

        **  Easy to install and use

                                                                Page  2

      Command Mode Parameters
      -----------------------

      PALERT allows several command parameter switches to be specified
      to customize the process.  All these parameters are optional.
      The command format and switch parameters are described below.  A
      quick review of command parameters is always available by
      entering the PALERT command with the /H parameter.

      COMMAND FORMAT:

      PALERT [drive:]    [ (/ switches) ]


      [drive:]  If desired you may specify the drive where space
                is to be checked.  If the drive letter is not
                specified, the current defualt drive is checked.
                PALERT will also check multiple drives.  For example:
                PALERT CDE will check drives C, D, and E and give
                you a cumulative display.  (This alos works with all
                parameters)


      /Wppp     Warn the user and set DOS ERRORLEVEL flag if the
                percentage of free disk space is less than the
                ppp value specified.

                /W5 indicates to warn user if less than 5 percent
                of disk space is free.


      /Bbbbb    Warn the user and set DOS ERRORLEVEL flag if the
                number of kilobytes of free disk space is less than
                the bbbb value specified.  The maximum value of
                bbbb is 32767.

                /B3000 indicates to warn the user if less than
                3,000,000 characters of disk free space exist.

      /Lxxx     Warn when available memory is less than xxx.
                Sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL flag to 2.

                PALERT /L400 will warn you if memory is below
                400,000 bytes.

      /E        SupprEss the disk check and check only memory

      /N        A scale that shows used disk space is normally
                shown to the user each time PALERT is run.  To
                prevent the scale from being displayed, enter the
                /N parameter.


      /M        Messages are normally shown to indicate the Total,
                Used, and Free disk space.  If these messages are
                not normally wanted, enter the /M parameter.  Then
                they will only be issued when the user is warned.
                                                                Page  3


      /P        After the user is warned of insufficient disk/memory
                space, PALERT will pause to make sure the user is aware
                of the situation.  To avoid this pause enter /P.


      /S        When PALERT detects insufficient disk/memory space it
                sounds an alert to the user.  To avoid this noise
                specify the /S parameter.


      /C        Each time PALERT is run it reminds the user that
                HELP is available by entering the /H parameter.  To
                avoid this message enter /C.


      /H        PALERT contains internal help that is available at
                any time by using the /H parameter.

                                                                Page  4


      Examples:

      1.  Warn user when less than 1,000,000 characters of disk
          space is available.

              ===> PALERT C: /B1000 /C


      2.  Warn user when less than 5 percent of disk space is
          available.

              ===> PALERT C: /W5 /C


      3.  Warn user when less than 300K of memory is available:

              ===> PALERT /L300


      4.  DOS batch file that will check disk space each time
          the LOTUS command is entered.  If the desired disk
          space is not available stop the command.

            PALERT /b2000/m
            if errorlevel 1 goto error
            LOTUS
            goto end
            :error
            ECHO command terminated due to insufficient disk space
            :end

          This sample DOS batch file may be found in the .ARC file
          that contains this program.  Name=PA123.BAT.
