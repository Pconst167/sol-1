     HS/Link  is a  high speed  file transfer  protocol with  full streaming,
     simultaneous  send, receive and CHAT, and advanced Full-Streaming-Error-
     Correction(tm).  Each side of  the link is allowed to provide  a list of
     files to be  sent.  Files will travel simultaneously  in BOTH directions
     until both sides of the link are satisfied.

     HS/Link is not just  another bi-directional protocol, it is  also a very
     fast protocol  for normal downloading and  uploading, incorporating some
     new ideas  (such as  Full-Streaming-Error-Correction(tm),  Dynamic-Code-
     Substitution  and Minimal-Blocks(tm)) to make things happen a bit faster
     and with greater reliability.

        ___________________________________________________________________

     What is a file transfer protocol?

     A file transfer protocol is a means of transferring information from one
     computer  to another.  The protocol has the responsibility of protecting
     against errors  in transit, and  taking measures to  correct any  errors
     that are detected.  The design and implementation of a protocol can make
     the difference between slow and  unreliable communication, and fast  and
     trouble free communication.

     Not all protocols  are created equal.   With today's high speed  modems,
     packet  switched  networks  (such as  PC  Pursuit),  and  expensive long
     distance charges,  users demand more  than ever that  files get  through
     quickly and without corruption.

     The  HS/Link protocol  is  the result  of  many years  of  communication
     experience,  and uses some  new and  very solid technology to  see to it
     that  you can  easily move files  as quickly  as possible,  and with the
     least amount of hassle.

     The HSLINK  program can be used  from the DOS  command line, from  BATCH
     files, or  as an "external protocol" from most  modern COMM programs and
     BBS  programs.  If  your favorite  BBS does not yet  support the HS/Link
     protocol, please ask your SYSOP to install it.


     Recent advances in high speed modem technology have   =================
     made it possible to simultaneously transfer data at   === Quick Tip ===
     high speeds in both directions.   This standardized   =================
     technology is  called "V.32"  or "V.32bis",  and is      Bi-directional
     available in many new modems.  Until HS/Link, these       features that
     advanced  modems were  left half  idle, due  to the     really work... 
     single-direction  nature  of  other  file  transfer         HS/Link can
     protocols.    The  bi-directional  capabilities  of      simultaneously
     HS/Link  take  full  advantage  of   these  modems,    send and receive
     cutting  online  time as  much  as  50% when  equal              files!
     amounts of data are transmitted and received.

     HS/Link also takes  full advantage of 1200 and 2400  baud modems, giving
     you very nearly the best thru-put such modems are capable of.

        ___________________________________________________________________

                              Summary of Key Features
        ___________________________________________________________________

     ù Speed.
          HS/Link operates at, or  very near peak efficiency,  often reaching
          98%  or more  with  pre-compressed files  and  non-buffered modems.
          Even higher speeds  are possible with buffered or  error correcting
          modems.  A number of features, such as fast  32 bit CRC protection,
          Full-Streaming-Error-Recovery     and    Dynamic-Code-Substitution,
          combine to give maximum performance and security.

     ù Simple interface for beginners.
          In many cases,  HS/Link requires only the  COM port number and  the
          filename to be transmitted.   Configuration files are not required.
          The  program is easily installed in most COMM programs that support
          external protocols.  The HSLINK program has multiple help  screens,
          providing  a quick reference to the basic and advanced command line
          options, including examples of how the program is used.

     ù Batch file transfers.
          The protocol can handle any  size batch of files, and can take file
          specifications from either the command line or from a listing file.

     ù Bi-directional options that really work.
          The  program can simultaneously  upload and download  with a single
          host  request.   What's even  better is  how easy  it is  to use...
          instead of a complex setup all you do is:

          1)   Tell the BBS the names of the files you  want to download, and
               then
          2)   Press  PGUP (or  whatever  your COMM  program  uses  to UPLOAD
               files) and then tell your COMM program which files to upload

          By virtue of the  BBS being told that it is  sending files and your
          COMM program telling HS/Link that it too is sending files, you then
          have  a bi-directional transfer.   There's nothing else  to set up.
          You use the familiar BBS interface to request files to download and
          your  COMM program's familiar  interface to tell it  which files to
          upload.  It couldn't get easier!

     ù Aborted file crash recovery.
          When desired, HS/Link can resume an aborted transfer, verifying all
          existing data blocks to insure the resumed file completely  matches
          the file being transmitted.   This function can also  update a file
          that has only a small number of changed, added, or deleted blocks.

                                    Quick Tour
        ___________________________________________________________________

     If  you are  eager to  see HS/Link  in action,  follow the  simple steps
     below.   The following pages will tell  you how to install and configure
     the HS/Link program for optimal ease of use and performance. 

     1.  Unpack the HSLINK  program into a working  directory or your choice.
     All you really need is HSLINK.EXE for now.

     2.  Use  the TERMINAL  program of  your  choice to  call up  a  BBS that
     supports the HS/Link protocol.  If you don't know of a BBS in your area,
     you can  always call  the Tool  Shop BBS  at (818)  891-1344 to  see how
     HS/Link works.

     3.  When online  with  your  BBS, select  a  DOWNLOAD  using the  HSLINK
     protocol.  

     4.  When the  BBS is  ready for  you to  begin, press  the SHELL  TO DOS
     command in your  terminal program.   In many terminal programs,  this is
     the ALT-J command.  Later  you will be given instructions to tie HS/Link
     into  the  DOWNLOAD command,  but for  now  we are  going to  run HSLINK
     manually so you can see it in action right away.

     5. CD into the HSLINK working directory you set up in step 1.

     6. If your modem is on COM1, type the command
               HSLINK -P1
     If your modem is on COM2, instead use the command
               HSLINK -P2

     You should  now  see HS/Link  in action.    If your  copy of  HSLINK  is
     registered, you can press the ENTER key to begin a CHAT session with the
     person  running the BBS.   If  you aren't registered yet,  you can still
     CHAT, but the BBS operator has to start the CHAT for you.

     In  this sample session  you aren't doing a  bidirectional transfer, but
     you  to do  so  all  you need  to  do is  add  the outgoing  file  names
     (including drive and directory) to the end of the command line above.

     7. When HSLINK finishes, type the command
               EXIT
     to return to your TERMINAL program to continue your BBS session.

     The  first window  contains  the program  identification  and copyright.
     When you  register your copy of  HSLINK, this window will  also show the
     registered serial number.  Some warning messages may also appear in this
     window.

     The "Settings" window shows a summary of the various parameters that can
     be altered with  command line options.   This display space is  replaced
     with the InComing Chat and OutGoing Chat windows during CHAT operation.

     The "InComing  Files" window shows  the status of  files being  received
     from the remote system.

     The  "OutGoing Files" window shows the status of files being transmitted
     to the remote system.

     The  "Batch  Status"  window  summarizes  overall session  progress  and
     estimates the time remaining for the selected files.

     To  stop display bleedthrough  under DesqView or DoubleDOS,  use the -NV
     option to disable  direct video writing.  The result  will be a slightly
     slower display, but it will not bleed from one partition to another.

     If desired, the full screen status display can be turned off.

                                Command Line Format
        ___________________________________________________________________

     To  run the HSLINK program,  a command line must be  given.  The command
     line has the following format:

     HSLINK [options] [SENDFILE] [@DRIVE:\PATH\FILELIST]

     SENDFILE  Indicates  a  list  of  files  to  be  transmitted  to  remote
               computer.   The list  may include the  DOS wildcard characters
               '?' and '*'.  Specify ONLY   files to be transmitted; received
               file names are determined automatically.

     @FILELIST Transmit  list  of  files  contained  in  FILELIST  to  remote
               computer.  This is used when  you want to make a long list  of
               files  in advance,  then  transmit  them  all  with  a  single
               command.   It is  also used  by BBS  programs to  produce long
               batches of downloads.

     ù    Anything shown in brackets "[]" is optional and may  not need to be
          specified for proper operation of HS/Link.

     ù    The HSLINK command line is NOT  case sensitive, and will work  when
          typed in upper, lower or mixed case.

     ù    Please make sure that HSLINK.EXE is in a search PATH directory.


        ___________________________________________________________________

                            Basic Command Line Options
        ___________________________________________________________________

     The most important command line  options are -P (set COM port),  -U (set
     download file directory), and -HS (enable slow handshake).

     -Pport    This sets which COM port you are using.  
               Example:  -P2

     -Udir     This  sets  the destination  directory  for downloaded  files.
               Without this option,  all download files  are placed into  the
               current directory.
               Example:  -Uc:\bbsfiles

     -HS       Handshake Slow (send  XOFF and/or lower RTS  during disk I/O).
               This  option may  be required  if your  computer is  unable to
               simultaneously access the disk  and the COM port.  If  you see
               frequent CRC  error messages, even  on clean phone  lines, you
               probably need to include -HS in your command line.

     To abort an HS/Link transfer, press Control-X four or more times.

     command  line.   If  you  are  calling HSLINK  from             require
     multiple   batch   files,    you   can   also   use       configuration
     configuration files to store "common" options, that              files.
     can be changed in  one place rather than separately
     in the various batch files.

     HSLINK  will first search the current directory for   =================
     the HSLINK.CFG  file.  If  not found, it  will then   === Quick Tip ===
     search  the directory  where HSLINK.EXE  is stored,   =================
     followed  by  all  directories  in  the   DOS  PATH   For best results,
     setting. If the HSLINK.CFG file is found, each file    add your HS/Link
     line is loaded as a command line option.                or COMM program
                                                           directory to your
                                                             PATH statement.
     If you want to use an alternate configuration file,
     use  the -@fname  command line  option,  which will
     cause 'fname' to be loaded.  For example:
          HSLINK -@C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG
     will cause HSLINK to use C:\WORK\TOLAP.CFG as the configuration file.

     If -@fname is not the first command  line option, the default HSLINK.CFG
     file  will be searched for and loaded before the specified configuration
     file.

     Use  -@ (without  a filename)  to prevent  HSLINK  from searching  for a
     configuration  file, slightly speeding operation on  systems that have a
     long search PATH setting in effect.



     To aid in creation and alteration  of configuration   =================
     files, the HS/Link  Configuration Manager  program,   === Quick Tip ===
     HSCONFIG, was written.                                =================
                                                             Use HSCONFIG to

     HSLINK includes the HS/Link Configuration Manager program, HSCONFIG.EXE.
     With  this  program you  can  easily manipulate  most of  HS/Link's many
     options.

     HSCONFIG  can be used to edit any configuration file, but the default is
     to edit HSLINK.CFG  in the current directory,  or the same directory  in
     which HSLINK.EXE is found.  If you want to edit some other configuration
     file, you must specify the  filename on the HSCONFIG command line.   For
     example:
          HSCONFIG TOLAP.CFG

     will create or  edit TOLAP.CFG, which can later be used by HSLINK with a
     command line like this:
          HSLINK -@TOLAP.CFG

     When   no  configuration   filename  is   specified,  and   the  default
     configuration file  HSLINK.CFG cannot be located,  it will automatically
     be created in the  same directory that HSLINK.EXE  is found in.   If you
     wish to create the configuration file in a different directory, you must
     explicitly specify  the directory/filename  to be  used on  the HSCONFIG
     command line.

     This screen manipulates the following options:

     -Pport
          Use COM port 1-8 (default=1).   Standard COM port definitions:
               Channel   I/O Port  Interrupt
                COM1      0x3F8          4

                COM8      0x3E8          5
          Use -PB and -PI instead of -P to define a non-standard COM port.

     -Udir
          Destination   directory   for   received   files   (default=current
          directory)

     -HS
          Handshake Slow (send XOFF and/or lower RTS during disk I/O).
          The slow handshake  option is available for systems with  slow disk
          access.   Use this if  you get frequent  CRC errors  or COM overrun
          errors  on otherwise clean lines.  The slow handshake option causes
          XOFF to be sent and/or RTS to be lowered  during any disk activity.
          Even  when -HS is active, the HS/Link protocol should transfer data
          very nearly as fast as the slowest part of the link allows.

          conflict with some  unusual modem cables or  serial ports.  If  the
          CTS signal is  not active when HSLINK loads, it  will automatically
          disable CTS  handshake for you.   Use the  -HC command to  manually
          disable CTS handshake.

     -HR
          Disables RTS hardware handshake.
          RTS receiver handshake  is used when  the slow-handshake option  is
          selected.  This form of  handshake causes the RTS line to the modem
          to be lowered  whenever the disk is  being accessed.   Some unusual
          modem or  cable arrangements may  not tolerate the  RTS line  being
          lowered.   In this  case, the RTS  handshake can  be disabled  with
          the -HR option.

     -HX
          Disable XON/XOFF handshake.
          XON/XOFF handshake is a software handshake scheme that  should work
          well on all combinations of modems and networks, and is enabled  by
          default.   If you prefer not to use XON/XOFF handshake, or you find
          that it is not required for error-free transfer, you can disable it
          with the -HX option.

          Note  that both  the sender  and  the receiver  must simultaneously
          disable XON/XOFF handshake, otherwise it will remain in effect.

     -C
          Disable  carrier detect  checking.   Use this option  when directly
          connecting two machines via a null modem cable.

     -NT
          Stamp current file time.   This option stamps the current time/date
          on  received   files,  instead  of  retaining   the  original  file
          time/date.

          Note  to BBS operators:  Crash recovery is enabled  by the caller's
          use of -R -K  -O options and should NOT be  directly enabled in the
          BBS command line or configuration file.

     -K
          Keep partial files from aborted transfers.

     -O
          Allow receive files to overwrite existing files.

     -NB
          Disable buffering of receive and transmit files.  The default is to
          divide approximately  24k of  memory between InComing  and OutGoing
          files.

     -NC
          Disable Dynamic-Code-Substitution logic.
          Certain  byte codes  cannot be  transmitted directly  over  the COM
          link. For instance, the codes for Control-X, Control-S and Control-
          Q must be  "escaped" to  prevent a  conflict with  flow or  program
          control.

          The HS/Link protocol uses a new Dynamic-Code-Substitution system to
          drastically reduce the number  protocol overhead and "escape" codes
          needed  to transmit certain  data streams.   Highly compressed data
          files  (such as ZIP  and GIF  files) benefit  the most,  since they
          often have many byte codes that cannot be transmitted directly over
          the COM link.

     -Ssize
          Sets transmit  block size 2-4096 (default=1024)  Larger block sizes
          may result in higher transfer speeds under clean line conditions.

     -Wwindow                                              =================
          Number  of blocks  allowed without  ACK 1-1000   === Quick Tip ===
          (default=8)                                      =================
          Use  -A  or -W0  to  establish  an  "infinite"    Use -W4 -S512 -!
          window (i.e. no ACK required at all).              with PC-Pursuit

          The "ACK window" is  the number of blocks that
          will be sent  to the modem before an  ACKnowledge code is required.
          If the specified number of blocks have been sent and no ACK has yet
          been received, output  will be suspended until the ACK  is received
          or  the link  times out.   This  provides a  form of  software flow
          control that  works  well when  parts  of the  link are  very  slow
          compared to other parts, such as when PC Pursuit is in use.

          The /w:XXX value displayed in the InComing Files window reports the
          actual  number  of  blocks  that  are being  transmitted  prior  to
          acknowledge.  Setting  the -W value higher than the  highest /w:XXX
          value observed will have no further effect on transfer thru-put.

     -A
          Disable  transmission  of ACK  codes  after each  block.   This may
          improve transfer speeds under some conditions. 

     -!
          Take priority.  Locally specified -A, -HX, -S, and -W settings will
          be used by the remote system.  The -N! option cancels the effect of
          the -! option.

     This screen manipulates the following options:

     -Iidle
          This option controls  how idle time is given up  under multitasking
          environments.  The possible values are:
               -I0  Default, do not give up idle time
               -I1  Spend idle time checking keyboard status
               -I2  Give up idle time under DesqView
               -I3  Give up idle time under DoubleDOS
               -I4  Give up idle time under Windows/OS2/VCPI/DOS5
          Some network server software, such as LanTastic, performs best when
          the -I1 option is used.

     -NM
          Enable Minimal-Blocks  logic.  Use  with caution.   This option  is
          recommended for use only on error-corrected links, such as with MNP
          or V.42 connections.

     -N5
          This  option causes  HS/Link  to disable  NS16550  buffering logic.
          This  option may be  needed with some early  versions, or incorrect
          clone versions of  the NS16550 chip, which do not  properly perform
          buffering.

     -FTn
          Sets NS16550 FIFO Threshold.
          This option controls the number of characters that will be buffered
          by  the  NS16550 internal buffer before an interrupt  is generated.
          Higher FIFO  thresholds will produce fewer  interrupts and somewhat
          less  CPU loading,  but with  the risk  of  overrun errors.   Lower
          thresholds  will prevent  overrun errors  under  multi-taskers like
          Windows or Desqview.

     -LFlogfile
          Specify status log file.
          This option allows you to override the DSZLOG environment  variable
          to  specify the  file to  be  used for  status  logging. Omit  this
          option,  or leave blank to control this function through the DSZLOG
          environment variable.

     -NOdirlist
          Incoming file duplication checklist.

          This option allows you to check incoming files for duplication in a
          list of  directories.   This feature prevents  incoming files  from
          duplicating files in directories other than the current -U setting.

          The dirlist is a text file which contains one filename or directory
          specification  per line.    See MKDLIST  documentation  for special
          instructions to speed CD-ROM duplication checking.

          Note   that  this  option  is  effective  ONLY  if  the  -O  (allow
          overwrites) is NOT used.

     -FC
          Force CTS hardware handshake.
          This  option  prevents  HSLINK  from  automatically  disabling  CTS
          hardware handshake if CTS is not active initially.

     -NA
          This  option causes HS/Link  to use the old  XON/XOFF method rather
          than the new alternate method during the initial handshake with the
          remote.   This option  is needed only  if handshake fails  when the
          remote unit is  version 1.12  or earlier and  should not be  needed
          when communicating with newer versions.

     -NEn
          Controls the number of repeated errors needed to abort a transfer.

        ___________________________________________________________________

                           Advanced Command Line Options
        ___________________________________________________________________

     The HS/Link  protocol program has  a number of  additional command  line
     options, most  of which  are rarely  needed, or  which are  provided for
     advanced users to obtain maximum performance and flexibility.

     -@
          When the -@  option is given as the FIRST  parameter on the command
          line,  it prevents  HSLINK from  performing the  normal search  for
          HSLINK.CFG,  possibly  speeding   load  times  and  preventing  the
          accidental loading  of a configuration  file meant for  a different
          application.

     -@fname
          Uses fname  as an alternate configuration  file.  Each  line in the
          specified  file  may contain  a  single command  line option.   The
          default is to search PATH directories for HSLINK.CFG.

     -N!
          Do  not force  remote to  use local  settings.   Will  override any
          previous  -! option in  either the command line  or a configuration
          file.

     -NG
          Do not allow  Control-G (BEEP) characters in CHAT mode.  This keeps
          remote callers from beeping your speaker during a file transfer.

     -NK
          Cancels the effect  of the -K option, if present,  to force partial
          files from aborted transfers to be deleted.

     -NU
          Block uploads.    This option  is used by BBS  programs that cannot
          (yet) cope with bi-directional uploads.  It is used in place of the
          -U option on  the 'download' command  line, and has  the effect  of
          blocking any simultaneous upload requests from a user.

     -T
          Activates  a  "mini  terminal"  mode  prior to  starting  the  file
          transfer.  If  used with the -C option, you can use HS/Link to type
          "AT" commands directly to your modem to dial out.

        ___________________________________________________________________

                                 BBS Requirements
        ___________________________________________________________________

     HS/Link's  demands on  a bulletin  board program  are extremely  easy to
     fill.  The following is all that is necessary:

     1)   The  protocol  accepts  either  a  filename to   =================
          download  or  a  list  of  files of  the  form   === Quick Tip ===
          @DRIVE:\PATH\DOWNLIST.LST.   The protocol will   =================
          send  only the  specified files  if  filenames     Send file lists
          (without leading  @) are given, or  all of the      are text files
          files found in the file C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST if    that contain one
          the option @C:\BBS\DOWNLIST.LST is specified.    path/filename per
                                                                       line.

     2)   The  protocol will create  a DSZLOG compatible
          log file indicating the names  of all files transferred as  well as
          their status (refer  to the DSZ standard and the  "DSZLOG Statistic
          Logging" section for the specific contents of the file).


     3)   Any files  found in the DSZLOG  file which BBS   =================
          did not tell the  protocol to SEND are assumed   === Quick Tip ===
          to have instead been RECEIVED by the protocol.   =================
          The BBS should then check for the existence of    HS/Link does NOT
          such files and if found, ask for  descriptions   modify BBS upload
          and post them in the upload directory.           listings! The BBS
                                                                program must
                                                          detect uploads and
                                                            do it's own file

     If the BBS program is not yet able to cope with bi-   =================
     directional uploads, the -NU  option can be used on   === Quick Tip ===
     the 'download' command line to prevent  attempts to   =================
     perform a bi-directional upload.                       Use -NU to block

        ___________________________________________________________________

                             CHAT During File Transfer
        ___________________________________________________________________

     While  you are waiting for files to transfer, you can also type messages
     to the remote operators screen and see what he types in return.  This is
     called "CHAT mode".  

     If your copy  of HSLINK is  registered, you can  press the ENTER  key to
     begin  a CHAT session  with the person running  the BBS.   If you aren't
     registered yet,  you can still CHAT,  but the BBS operator  has to start
     the CHAT for you.

     Once you activate CHAT, the "Settings" portion of the display is removed
     and replaced with two new windows:  "InComing Chat" and "OutGoing Chat".
     Anything you type will appear in the OutGoing Chat display, and anything
     the remote operator types will appear in your InComing Chat display.  

     Chat mode features automatic word-wrap and keyboard correction using the
     backspace key.  

     You  can  "page" the  remote  user  by  pressing  Control-G  repeatedly.
     Control-G is the "BELL" character, which causes HSLINK to BEEP.  You can
     use the -NG command line option to disable  this feature, keeping HSLINK
     silent.

     When you  are finished chatting, just  press the ESC key  to restore the
     Settings  display and  to  terminate  the chat  mode.    Chat mode  will
     automatically terminate if you type nothing for 30 seconds and all files
     are finished transferring.


        ___________________________________________________________________

                               Optimizing CHAT Mode
        ___________________________________________________________________

     The CHAT  mode display may appear  sluggish, or jerky.   This is because
     HSLINK gives priority to the  file transfer and transmits CHAT text only
     between whole blocks of the file.   This effect is made worse by the use
     of large block sizes, especially at low baud rates.

     If you want  to have snappier chat displays, at  the expense of slightly
     slower  file transfers,  try  reducing the  BLOCK  SIZE (-S  option)  or
     setting a smaller ACK WINDOW (-W option).  Try adding 
          -S256 -W4
     to your command line, for example.

                                   Flow Control
        ___________________________________________________________________

     Flow Control  is required when  the sending and  receiving computers  or
     modems  operate at  different speeds,  or when  computers are  unable to
     simultaneously access disk  drives and the COM port.   Flow Control is a
     software  and/or hardware means of slowing down  the faster parts of the
     connection to prevent overloading the slower parts of the system.

     HS/Link uses  both XON/XOFF (software) and  RTS/CTS (hardware) handshake
     when  communicating  with high  speed  modems  or slow  packet  switched
     networks.   The protocol also  uses a  window algorithm to  suspend data
     transmission if the receiver  does not eventually respond to transmitted
     data.

     XON/XOFF  handshake is a software handshake scheme that should work well
     on all combinations of modems  and networks, and is enabled  by default.
     If you prefer not to use  XON/XOFF handshake, or you find that it is not
     required  for error-free  transfer,  you can  disable  it with  the  -HX
     option.   Note that both the sender and the receiver must simultaneously
     disable XON/XOFF handshake, otherwise it will remain in effect.

     The slow  handshake option  (-HS) is  available for   =================
     systems with slow disk access.  Use this if you get   === Quick Tip ===
     frequent  CRC  errors  or  COM  overrun  errors  on   =================
     otherwise clean  lines.  The slow  handshake option      The -HS option
     causes XOFF  to be  sent and/or  RTS to  be lowered  stops most overrun
     during any disk activity.  Even when -HS is active,      and CRC errors
     the  HS/Link protocol  should  transfer  data  very   that occur during
     nearly as  fast as  the  slowest part  of the  link      or immediately
     allows.                                                  after disk I/O

     CTS transmitter handshake is automatically enabled,
     but may conflict with some unusual modem cables or serial ports.  If the
     CTS  signal is  not  active when  HSLINK  loads, it  will  automatically
     disable  CTS handshake for you.  Use the -HC command to manually disable
     CTS handshake.

     RTS  receiver  handshake  is  used  when the  slow-handshake  option  is
     selected.  This form of handshake causes the RTS line to the modem to be
     lowered  whenever the  disk is  being accessed.   Some unusual  modem or
     cable arrangements may not tolerate the RTS line being lowered.  In this
     case, the RTS handshake can be disabled with the -HR option.

     If  you have frequent CRC errors or COM overrun errors, which persist in
     spite of the handshake-slow option (-HS), you should  consider upgrading
     your serial  port from  the usual  8250 to  a newer, buffered  NS16550AN
     chip.  The buffered chips are highly recommended if you are operating at
     high  baud  rates (>9600)  or  are  accessing  extended  memory  or  are
     multitasking.

     I have  also had  reports that use  of large numbers  of dos  BUFFERS in
     CONFIG.SYS can cause  overrun errors.  Try reducing the  BUFFERS setting
     to 10 or less, especially if you also use a DISK cache.

     Some  disk cache  programs  have also  been  reported to  cause  overrun
     errors.  Try turning the cache OFF before calling HSLINK, and turning it
     back ON again after the transfer is completed.

     Recent advances in high speed  modem technology have made it possible to
     simultaneously  transfer data at  high speeds in both  directions.  This
     standardized technology is called "V.32" or "V.32bis", and are available
     in many  new modems.   The bi-directional capabilities  of HS/Link  take
     full advantage of these modems,  cutting online time as much as 50% when
     equal amounts of data are transmitted and received.

     Some  older high speed modems, such  as the HST and   =================

     The  HS/Link  protocol  has  the unique  ability  to  recover from  many
     transmission errors without breaking out of full streaming mode.

     This  is important with buffered modems or packet switched networks with

        ___________________________________________________________________

     The  HS/Link  protocol  includes a  Minimal Blocks  feature,  which when
     activated, causes the protocol  to strip away repeated information  from
     the  protocol frames and transmit only the minimal amount of information
     required for data flow.

                             Dynamic Code Substitution
        ___________________________________________________________________

     Certain byte  codes cannot be  transmitted directly over  the COM  link.
     For instance, the  codes for Control-X, Control-S and Control-Q  must be
     "escaped" to prevent a conflict with flow or program control.

     The  HS/Link protocol  uses a  new Dynamic  Code Substitution  system to
     drastically reduce number protocol overhead and "escape" codes needed to
     transmit certain data streams.

     Highly compressed  data files (such  as ZIP and  GIF files) benefit  the
     most, since they  often have many byte codes  that cannot be transmitted
     directly over the COM link.

     The Dynamic Code Substitution feature can be disabled, if you wish, with
     the -NC option.

     multi-user or networked computers.  This works with   =================

     If  a  file  sharing  violation  is  detected  when
     opening a  file, control is passed  to the system's
     current  "critical  error"  handler.   To  automate  recovery  from file
     sharing  violations,  you  can  install  my FATAL14.ZIP  program,  which

     automatically retrys  after sharing violations, and keeps a detailed log
     of all critical errors in a system.

     Files transmitted  or received with HS/Link retain  their original exact
     size and time/date stamp.   No extra data is  added beyond EOF, as  with
     older  protocols.   The current  date/time will  be stamped  on incoming
     files  if the  -NT  option  is used.    Otherwise,  the original  file's
     time/date stamp will be retained.

     When run under  DOS 2.x, HSLINK automatically reverts to  non-share file
     modes.

     The  HS/Link  "ready" packet  is  repeated at  10 second  intervals when
     waiting for  the  HSLINK receiver  to be  started.   The  format of  the
     "ready" packet is:
          "HS*" ^B 
     or in hex,
          0x48 0x53 0x2a 0x02

     When this sequence of characters is received during a terminal 
     session, the HSLINK protocol should be executed.

          NOTE:  To  perform   a  bi-directional   transfer  with   Auto
          Downloading  active, you simply omit the final "CR" you key to
          the BBS  and instead allow HSLINK  to send then  when you have
          finished specifying  outgoing file names.   Otherwise the auto

          outgoing (upload) file names into your comm program.

                             DSZLOG Statistic Logging
        ___________________________________________________________________

     When you define the environment variable DSZLOG, the HSLINK program will
     enable transfer  logging to  the specified filename.   The log  file can
     also be set with the -FL option.  For example, the AUTOEXEC statement:
          SET DSZLOG=C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT
     will cause  HSLINK to log  files transmitted to  C:\LOGS\LOG.OUT.   This
     form of logging  provides compatibility with programs  that are designed
     to operate with DSZ or other DSZLOG-type protocols.

     The  log  file  consists  of  a  single  line  of  text  for  each  file
     transferred.  Here are some sample log entries:

  h 227596 10100 bps 1138 cps   0 errors   112 2316 V:\UPLOAD\ZLABP_13.ZIP 0

     Bad ____ CRC
          These messages  indicate that an  error was detected  in a  control
          message between the  sender and the receiver.  All  control packets
          are protected by a 32 bit CRC calculation to  provide highly secure
          and reliable communication.

     Bad data CRC (#)
     Dropped bytes -# (#)
     Noise burst # (#)
          These messages indicate  that an error was  detected in a block  of
          data  in the file  being received.  "Dropped  bytes" indicates that
          some expected  bytes did not  arrive, and  "Noise burst"  indicates
          that  more bytes  than  expected  arrived.    Error  correction  is
          automatic, because  of Full-Streaming-Error-Correction,  may  occur
          without breaking the stream of data being received.

          If  this message occurs at regular intervals,  it is a sign of flow
          control failure.   In  most cases, this  can be corrected  with the
          addition of the -HS command line option.

     COM#: Break! Framing! Overrun! Parity!
          These  messages indicate that  an error was detected  in the serial
          port receiver.   Framing and  Parity errors often  indicate a  baud
          rate (-B) mismatch.   Overrun errors usually indicate the  need for
          flow  control or for an upgrade to a buffered serial chip.  Overrun
          errors  can often be reduced or eliminated  with the use of the -HS
          command line option.

     Can't create file '___'
          This indicates that the  received file could not be  created.  This
          usually  indicates that the  directory specified in  the -U command
          line option is invalid, or that the disk is full.

     Carrier lost!
          This indicates that Carrier detect was dropped, aborting the HSLINK
          session.   If  your connection  does not  provide a  carrier detect
          signal, you can disable this check with the -C command line option.
          This is often  required when directly  connecting two computers  by
          means of a "null modem" cable.

     Disk write failure!  (#)
          This  usually  indicates that  the  disk is  full and  that further
          downloads cannot be received.

     File received OK, # cps, # seconds.
          The file  was received  correctly and is  now closed.   The average
          transfer speed  is calculated  based on  the elapsed  time  between
          receiving  the file  open packet  and the  last byte  of the  file.

          Transfer speeds are  calculated using the DOS timer tick,  which is
          not accurate for  transfers taking less than 1 minute  to complete.
          For very short transfers, a cps rating of 9999 will be returned.

     File sent OK, # cps, # seconds.
          The file was  transmitted correctly and is now closed.  The average
          transfer speed  is calculated  based on  the elapsed  time  between
          sending the first byte of the file and the last byte of the file.

     File skipped by remote!
          The transmitter prints this  message when the receiver requests the
          current  file be skipped.   This usually happens  when the receiver
          detects  a  duplicate filename  and  is  not allowed  to  overwrite
          existing files.

     File was incomplete!  (# #)
          This  message indicates that  the transfer was aborted  in some way
          before  the  specified  file  was  completely received.    Normally
          incomplete files are erased from disk, but they will be retained of
          the -K command line option is used.

     Flow control released (#### t:# r:#)
          If  output flow has  been suspended by either  software or hardware
          flow control for more than 15 seconds, the program will assume that
          there has been a failure of flow control and  will release the hold
          so data can continue.  The codes in parenthesis indicate which flow
          controls were  active at  the time (C=CTS  was down,  T=transmitter
          XOFF  was pending,  R=receiver XOFF  was pending,  A=transmitter is
          currently  active)  and the  counts  of bytes  in the  transmit and
          receive holding queues.

     Handshake: CTS XON/XOFF SLOW ALT
          This  message indicates  the  current combination  of  flow control
          options  that are  in  effect.   CTS  indicates CTS  hardware  flow
          control is active.  XON/XOFF indicates that  XON/XOFF software flow
          control is  active.  SLOW  indicates that flow  will be  restrained
          during disk I/O to prevent overrun errors.  ALT indicates  that the
          alternate XON/XOFF method is being used.

     HS/Link finished! (t:# r:#) Exit code = #
          When HSLINK terminates, it sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL to the specified
          value.    This can  be  checked  in  batch files  to  detect  error
          conditions.  The following ERRORLEVEL codes are possible:

          ERRORLEVEL     Reason for link termination

             0           One or more files transferred successfully
             1           ^X typed at local keyboard
             2           ^X received over COM port
             3           Incompatible BETA versions
             4           No files transmitted or received
             5           Remote did not respond within 2 minutes
             6           Too many framing errors, possible -B mismatch

          COMM  and  BBS programs  should  use  the  DSZLOG  output  file  to
          determine more specific details of transfer results.

          The  (t:# r:#) display  indicates the number  of files successfully
          transmitted and received.

     Not allowed to overwrite existing file '___'
          This  indicates that a file was received but there was another file
          with the same  name already in the download file directory.  Either
          erase the  duplicate file, or use  the -O option  to allow existing
          files to be overwritten.

     Insufficient memory to load program.
     Not enough memory!
          There  was  not enough  memory  available  to  run  HSLINK.    Free
          additional  memory  by  removing  "TSR"  software,  device drivers,
          ramdisks or  disk caches.  If  your COMM program has  the option of
          swapping  to  DISK or  EMS,  enable the  option to  free additional
          memory for  HSLINK's use.   Current beta copies  of HSLINK  require
          about 64k  of RAM, but  the specific amount  of memory required  is
          subject to change from beta to beta.  You can reduce  the amount of
          memory required if you use  the -NB command line option  to disable
          file buffering.

     Out of sequence # (#)
          This  indicates  that  the  received  block  was out  of  sequence,
          indicating  that  a  block  was  possibly  missed  or  lost  during
          transmission.    The  receiver  will  request  the  transmitter  to
          retransmit the missing block(s).

     Read failure at #
          This indicates  that there  was a disk  error reading a  file being
          transmitted.

     Receive timeout (#)
     ACK timeout, resend #
          This message indicates that it has been too long since the receiver
          responded to data transmission.  The last data block is repeated in
          an attempt to wake up the receiver.

     Received block # (# bytes) # cps
          This  displays the current status of  the file being received.  The
          current number of blocks and bytes received is displayed after each
          block is received.  The estimated transfer  speed in ch/sec is also
          displayed.

     Received block # (# bytes) E#
          When "E#" is  displayed following the received block #  message, it
          indicates  that  error  recovery  is  in  progress,  and  that  the
          specified block  number was  in error and  is in  transit from  the
          transmitter.   When the erroneous block has been received correctly
          the E# display  will advance to the next erroneous block number, or
          will be erased if no more erroneous blocks are pending.

     Received block # (# bytes) R
          When  "R" is displayed  following the received block  # message, it
          indicates that current block has been previously received correctly
          and  is  therefore a  "repeat"  block.   Repeat blocks  occur under
          severe error conditions and are usually corrected automatically.

     Receiving file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
          This message indicates that  a new file is being received  from the
          transmitter.  The file size is displayed in blocks and bytes.

     Remote not responding!
          This  indicates that the remote computer did not execute HSLINK and
          establish  a connection within the two minute timeout period.  This
          message  could also  indicate  that the  wrong  com port  is  being
          selected,  or that  the port  is configured improperly  (wrong port
          speed or IRQ setting).

     Resending block #
          This message indicates that the receiver has detected an  erroneous
          block  and is  requesting a  re-transmission  to correct  the data.
          Data flow continues where it left off prior to the resend, allowing
          error recovery to take place without breaking out of full streaming
          mode and without discarding data that is already in  transit to the
          receiver.  This is the basis of Full-Streaming-Error-Correction.

     Restarting current file
          This  indicates that the receiver was unable to recover from errors
          encountered in  processing the current file  being transmitted, and
          has requested that the file be started again from scratch.

     Seek from block # to #
          Under the most  severe error conditions,  the receiver may  request
          the transmitter to discard data that is  in transit to the receiver
          and  to  rewind to  an  earlier position  in  the  file and  resume
          transmission.

     Sending block # (# bytes/w:#) # cps
          This  is  the   normal  status  display  while  a  file   is  being
          transmitted.  The  message indicates the latest block number  to be
          transmitted,  and  in parenthesis  indicates  the  number of  bytes
          transmitted and  the  current  number  of  blocks  that  have  been
          transmitted without acknowledgement,  which represents the  size of
          the transmit  "window" that  is currently  in use.   If  this value
          hangs  at the current -W setting, you  may benefit from a higher -W
          setting on the command line.  The estimated transfer  speed is also

          reported in ch/sec.

     Sending file: ___ (# blocks, # bytes)
          This message indicates that a new file is being transmitted  to the
          receiver.  The file size is displayed in blocks and bytes.

     Transfer aborted!
          This  message  indicates that  the current  file transfer  has been
          aborted  for some  reason.   The specific  reason for  the transfer
          abort is usually also printed on the screen.

     Waiting for remote.
          This message indicates that HSLINK is waiting to handshake with the
          remote computer.   HSLINK will  wait for  60 seconds for  the other
          computer to come online; after that the transfer is aborted.   This
          message can  also  indicate that  you  don not  have the  COM  port
          correctly specified  or that a non-standard  COM port configuration
          may be required.

     Warning: CTS signal missing!  -HC will be assumed.
          The CTS hardware handshake is normally enabled by default.  If,  on
          initial  loading,  HSLINK finds  that  the CTS  signal is  down, it
          assumes that  the current hardware  configuration is not  using CTS
          handshake and automatically disables further  CTS handshake checks.
          Use the -HC command line to manually disable CTS handshake.

     Window: #
          This  indicates the actual number of  blocks that are allowed to be
          in transit without  acknowledgement.  This is controlled by  the -W
          parameter,  and may  be overridden  by the  remote computer  if the
          remote uses the -!  (take priority) option.

     Window: NONE
          This  indicates that the -A command line option has been specified,
          and  that  the transmitter  is  required  to continue  indefinitely
          without  receiving any  kind of  acknowledgement from  the receiver
          that data is being received correctly.
