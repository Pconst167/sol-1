OverView:

        Megafont is a program design for users to define their external
256 color VGA Fonts for THG Intro Maker v3.0.  This program gives the user
a chance to define a font from a picture he has drawn as letters for
scrolling text.  The largest font being a 50x50 font, the user has many
options in front of them and is only limited by their imaginations.
        The First thing you come upon, is a request for a format of your
picture.  By determining the extension, the program then lists all files
with that current extension in the current directory.  Type in the file
name of the picture you have drawn your font on.  It will then display the
picture after unpacking it, and giving you a box which moves with the mouse.
By using the I-J-K-M keys, expand or shrink the box around one of your
uniform letters. The Largest Box you may have is 50x50 and the smallest box
is 5x5 pixels.  After expanding or shrinking the box to your desired font
size, press ESC or Q to quit.
        Next, is the Definition screen.  This screen displays all the offsets
and the current filename of which you are working with.  Using ALT-H gives
the user some on-line commands which are quite useful.  From this screen you
will either type the key, or move the mouse cursor and click the button on
the character for which you wish to define.  Remember, if you use the
keyboard, CAPSLOCK does matter.  You can use the PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN to copy
the offsets of the upper to the lower case letters, and vice versa
respectively.  This is handy, but not necessary.  Remember, your imagination
can go wild here.  The Program doesn't care what the picture is, it just
wants your offsets.
        After pressing a key, or clicking on the letter you wish to define,
the picture will be displayed, along with the Box which you created in the
first Graphics screen.  Move the cursor using the mouse or the keypad to
the apprioriate letter or whatever and click the mouse button or hit ENTER.
By hitting Q for Quit/Abort, it will not save the offset.  This is built in
for mistakes.  Using the + and - keys, change the color of the definition
box to whatever is the most visible.  Also using the F1-F3 keys, you can
change the overwrite method of the box from XOR,AND,OR respectively.  This
is also handy.
        After defining the letters you are going to use in your scroll,
don't forget to save the coordinates in your .CRD file by using the ALT-S
option from the Definition menu.

Note :
        Documentation may suck, but it is an easy program to use.  Just bare
with it.  You will get the feel for it.  It isn't too hard.  We use it
almost everyday.
