This short manual is a quick guide to help you through the basic
installation of the demo version of InterMail. It will not however be
sufficient for you to learn everything about InterMail and make a
perfect setup. To do that, you will need the 450 page softcover bound
manual which you will receive when you purchase InterMail. The manual
for our echomail tosser InterEcho is not ready yet. Please read
README.1ST for info about other files.

Installation
------------
Expand this file package into a temporary directory, for example
\TEMP. Change to your \TEMP directory and then run INSTALL.EXE. The
Installation Program will ask a few questions about you which you
simply fill in.

You will be presented with a list of modems, from which you choose
your own or a similar modem. If you later find that the chosen modem
is not working perfectly, you may choose another one and do this over
again, as many times as necessary. You can later customize the modem
settings as well to suit your own purposes.

The last screen in the Installation Program will provide you with the
default directories that you would like InterMail to use.

A small nodelist IMLIST.* will be unarchived to the \IM\NODELIST
directory. If you would like to use the FidoNet nodelist, you may
later copy the NODELIST.* file to \IM\NODELIST. Use the program 
XLAXDIFF for the NODEDIFF.A* difference files. XLAXDIFF is not 
bundled with InterMail.



The Internal Serial Driver
--------------------------
InterMail will primarily use its own internal routines for handling
the serial port. The internal routines provide full support for the
FIFOs of the buffered 16550A UART. They are highly optimized and will
usually prove slightly more efficient than an external FOSSIL driver.

If you start IM.EXE without first having installed a FOSSIL,
InterMail will use its internal serial driver. If you start a FOSSIL,
like X00, before IM.EXE, InterMail will not use the internal driver,
unless you force it to with the /NF (No Fossil) command line option.
Example:

  im /nf

In some cases it may be desirable to use an external FOSSIL driver.
Some multitasking environments like Windows, may mask the registers
of the UART chip, so that InterMail cannot correctly identify the
chip or enable the FIFOs. The internal serial routines will only work
on a standard port 1 and a standard port 2. If you would like to use
other serial ports, you will need to use X00. DESQview users may also
find that only one serial port will work with the internal serial
routine.



Using X00
---------
X00 is an external FOSSIL driver that can be loaded via CONFIG.SYS or
IMRUN.BAT, the batch file that Install creates for running InterMail.

Example from CONFIG.SYS:

device=c:\im\x00.sys e b,0,38400 t=512 r=1024

The above installs X00 on serial port 1, eliminates X00's opening
screen, locks the com port at 38400 bps, sets the transmit buffer to
512 bytes and the receive buffer to 1024 bytes.

Example from IMRUN.BAT:

x00.exe e b,1,2400

The above installs X00 as a TSR on serial port 2, eliminates X00's
opening screen and locks the com port at 2400 bps.

If you have trouble with X00, you may use XU S to see the status of
your ports.



BBS
---
InterMail can start your BBS program. If an incoming call is a human
using a terminal program, IM.EXE can create a DOBBS.BAT and then exit
to IMRUN.BAT with a specific errorlevel. The IMRUN.BAT will then
start the DOBBS.BAT which in its turn starts the EXEBBS.BAT file,
which finally starts your BBS software. When the caller is finished,
the BBS program terminates and your EXEBBS.BAT starts the IMRUN.BAT
file, which starts the mailer again.

In IMSETUP.EXE, type in which errorlevel IM.EXE should exit with,
in Modem -> Advanced setup -> Connect strings -> BBSexit

    #   Connect Message           Speed  EC  BBSexit  Terminate
    컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
    1   CONNECT|                  300    N   99       0
    2   CONNECT 1200|             1200   N   99       0
    3   CONNECT 1200/             1200   Y   99       0
    4   CONNECT 1275              1200   N   99       0
    5   CONNECT 7512              1200   N   99       0
    6   CONNECT 2400|             2400   N   99       0
    7   CONNECT 2400/             2400   Y   99       0
    8   CONNECT 4800              4800   Y   99       0
    9   CONNECT 7200              7200   Y   99       0
   10   CONNECT 9600              9600   Y   99       0
   11   CONNECT 12000             12000  Y   99       0
   12   CONNECT 14400             14400  Y   99       0
   13   CONNECT 16800             16800  Y   99       0
   14   CONNECT 19200             19200  Y   99       0
   15   CONNECT 21600             21600  Y   99       0
   16   CONNECT 24000             24000  Y   99       0
   17   CONNECT 26400             26400  Y   99       0
   18   CONNECT 28800             28800  Y   99       0
   19   CONNECT 38400             38400  Y   99       0

Set Mailer -> Errorlevel -> Create BAT.file = Yes
Set Mailer -> Miscellaneous -> Mail-only (no BBS) = No
Set Mailer -> Miscellaneous -> BBS software name
Set Manager -> Events -> Edit -> Behavior -> Allow users ... = Yes

Make sure your IMRUN.BAT looks similar to this:

    :loop
    cd \im
    im.exe /#1 /nf
    if errorlevel  99 dobbs
    if errorlevel  50 goto InterEcho
    if errorlevel  10 exit
    if errorlevel   8 exit
    if errorlevel   4 goto fatal
    if errorlevel   3 goto dspace
    if errorlevel   1 goto fatal
    goto loop

The DOBBS.BAT is created by InterMail to start the EXEBBS.BAT with
these parameters:

    %1 = Connect speed, not locked port speed.
    %2 = Communication port number.
    %3 = Minutes to the next event that doesn't allow BBS calls.
    %4 = Reminder of connect message from modem, e.g. ARQ, MNP etc.
    %5 = Mailer server number.

The hardest part is the EXEBBS.BAT file. It will be started from
\IM, start your BBS program, use the %1, %2, %3, %4, %5 variables
and finally start the IMRUN.BAT. This is a very short example:

    cd \bbsdir
    mybbs -b%1%4 -p%2 -T%3 %5
    cd \im
    imrun




Multi-Line
----------
You may use up to 4 phone lines in this demo version. Each line needs
a running copy of IM.EXE. This means that you need a multi-tasking
environment like DESQview, OS/2 or Windows, but you may also use a
LAN (Local Area Network). Make sure you load SHARE.EXE on all PC's.

If you plan to use InterMail on a LAN, we suggest you use the same
drive letter on all work stations for logon to the drive where
InterMail is installed, for example drive I:. On the PC where the
drive is located physically, you may use the DOS SUBST program, for
example:

  subst I: C:\

Wherever you look in your LAN, InterMail is always on drive I. In
the IMSETUP program, you may change all paths to drive I.

There are several different ways to setup InterMail as a multi-line
system, depending on the result you want. The easiest way to add an
extra phone line is to do this:

In the IMSETUP.EXE:
1. Global -> Mail Server ID#, enter "2".
2. Global -> Filenames, enter a unique packets directory and
   a unique log file, for example I:\LOG\IMLOG.002.
3. Modem -> Modem Selection, choose modem.
4. Modem -> Advanced setup -> Hardware, set the port, speed etc.

Create \IM\NODE1 and \IM\NODE2.

Rename IMRUN.BAT to IMRUN01.BAT 

Copy IMRUN01.BAT to IMRUN02.BAT 

Edit IMRUN01.BAT:                  and IMRUN02.BAT
    :loop                             :loop
    cd \im\node1                      cd \im\node2
    im.exe /#1 /nf                    im.exe /#2 /nf

Copy \IM\EXEBBS.BAT to \IM\NODE1\EXEBBS.BAT
Copy \IM\EXEBBS.BAT to \IM\NODE2\EXEBBS.BAT

Delete \IM\EXEBBS.BAT

Edit \IM\NODE1\EXEBBS.BAT so it starts the proper BBS node.

You should now be able to run both mailers at the same time. They
will all share the nodelist, netmail area, message base, and *.exe
files. The extra cost in hard drive space is less than 50 kb per
phone line. They will use identical addresses (AKAs) and colours, but
you may have unique routing (ROUTEIM.002), dial commands
(DIALCTL.002) and event configs.

If you want different AKA's on another mail server, then you should
use different FD.SYS files. Copy FD.SYS to \IM\NODE2, \IM\NODE3 etc.
Change the environment variable IM to the path for FD.SYS. Example:

    Set IM=I:\IM           for the mailer #1
    Set IM=I:\IM\NODE2     for the mailer #2
    Set IM=I:\IM\NODE3     for the mailer #3

When you start IMSETUP, make sure you have the right path. It is easy
to accidentally change to the wrong mail server. You can still share
the nodelist, message base, *.exe, events, routing etc if you like,
but you can also for example choose to have only the nodelist, *.exe
and semaphore directories as common.



Dial Commands
-------------
A sample DIALCTL.001 for a US Robotics HST Dual Standard on Mail
Server #1 might look like this:

    V32 ATB0|
    HST ATB1&K3|
    H14 ATB1&K3|
    H16 ATB1&K3|
    1:249/119 AT&K0&M0&N3|
    1:249/120 AT&K0&M0&N3|

The last two are 2400 baud nodes and it's sometimes helpful to force
2400 baud connects with no compression or error correction when using
an HST or a Dual Standard.

Since InterMail works with all nodelist flags, be sure you have
entries for the HST, H14 and H16 flags if you wish to initiate an
HST/HST connection whenever possible.



Routing
-------
The first mailer server uses ROUTE.IM, the second ROUTEIM.002, etc.

If you have previously been using FrontDoor, change the "*" wildcards
to the word "All" in your routing file and don't use the DIRECT
routing command as it is not supported by InterMail.

Example of ROUTE.IM for someone in Zone 1, Net 249:

    ;----------------------------------------------------------------
    ; InterMail Routing File - Node 1             Last update: 21 May
    ;----------------------------------------------------------------
    ;
    ; GLOBAL ROUTING SECTION
    ; These routings happen during all schedules unless redefined
    ; within an individual schedule block.
    ;

    forward-for 1:369/102 ; Who we'll allow forwarding of netmail for

    route-files 1:249/100 ; Specific routing of files to node 249/100

    ;
    ; Route netmail to my Hub - all mail goes to the Hub except nodes
    ; listed in the no-route statement below.  The hold statement may
    ; be used with all nodelist flags and within each schedule block.
    ; InterMail uses the wildcards "MyNet/All" and "All" in all routing.
    ;
    route-to    1:249/1 1:All 2:All 3:All 4:All 5:All 6:All
    no-route    1:249/101 106 114 1:369/102
    route-to    1:369/102 1:369/all

    ;

    ;
    Schedule @ All  ; Default
    ;
    Schedule A H16  ; Only H16 Nodes will qualify for mail.
    deny       MyNet/All
    unhold     H16
    ;
    Schedule P All  ; Unhold mail (if any) and poll the Hub
    unhold     1:249/1
    poll       1:249/1
    ;
    Schedule Z All  ; Zone Mail hour // Hold everything
    hold all
    ; end of file



Nodelist Control Table
----------------------
The nodelist Control Table has several important functions. The file
is named FDNODE.CTL and can be edited in the Nodelist Manager or by
any ASCII editor.

If a file named NODELIST with a numerical extension, e.g.
NODELIST.004 or NODELIST.144, exists in \IM\NODELIST, it will be used
when you compile the nodelist with IMNC /C or F9 in IMNC.EXE

If several files with different extensions exist, the Nodelist
Manager will pick the one with the highest number.

The PVTLIST statement allows additional nodelists to be added so that
you can participate in more than one network. Any nodelist that
doesn't follow the NODELIST.### naming convention can be included
with the PVTLIST command, for example:

PvtList imlist.*

If no path is included in the name, the Nodelist Manager will assume
that the file is in the nodelist directory specified in IMSetup.

In order for InterMail to be able to use a centrally distributed
nodelist, the phone numbers in the nodelist have to follow the same
format everywhere. This format includs country code and area code,
but not the extra digit that is used in many countries to dial a
long-distance call. For example:

A number in the 613 area code in Canada might look like this in the
nodelist: 1-613-555-5555. To dial the same number locally, you would
dial 555-5555. If you were within the 613 area, and this was not a
local call for you, you would dial 1-555-5555. The same number dialed
from any place in North America outside the 613 area would be dialed
exactly as it appears in the nodelist.

To handle the phone number translation, InterMail uses a dialing
table in the Control file. The table starts with the word DIAL and
ends with the word END. When you install InterMail, this table is
created automatically so that it will handle most calls from your
area code, but you may wish to improve on it to handle non-local
calls within your area code. The original table may look like this:

    DIAL / 011/#
      1-613-555-  1-555  ; long distance within the 613 area
      1-613-             ; local calls
      1-          1-     ; within the U.S. and Canada
    END

The format for the rest of the table is that you first specify the
part of a phone number that you want to translate and then what you
wish to replace it with. In the example, 1-613-555- would be
abbreviated to 1-555-. If part of a number should be deleted, the
second parameter on the line can be left empty.

The example table could be improved by adding exchanges in the 613
area code which are not local calls wherever InterMail is located.

      1-613-444-   1-444-
      1-613-777-   1-777-

NOTE: A change in the dialing table requires that you recompile the
nodelist before it can take effect.

The cost table is used to inform InterMail of the cost per minute for
each area it is likely to dial. The table starts with the word COST
and ends with the word END. The format is similar to that of the
dialing table:

  COST  65  350
   1-613-      0 ; local call
   1-212-     45 ; New York
   44-       110 ; United Kingdom
   46-       125 ; Sweden
  END

The COST command takes two parameters: the default national cost and
the default international cost. The format of the rest of the list is
simple. First enter the beginning of a phone number (country code and
area code, where applicable) and then the highest daytime cost per
minute of calling it.



Semaphore files
---------------
A feature in InterMail exists where you can force the mailer to drop
to your IMRUN.BAT file with a specified errorlevel, and can be useful
in multi-node BBS setups, effectively enabling one BBS task to
communicate with another Mail Server. (This also works over a LAN,
assuming the semaphore directories are identical).

To cause this exit with your specified errorlevel, simply make a file
called IMEXIT##.??? in your semaphore directory, where ## is the mail
server number and ??? is the errorlevel you would like the mailer to
exit with. IMEXIT00.??? will tell ALL InterMail tasks using that
semaphore directory to exit with that errorlevel. DOS command:

          REM > C:\IM\SEMA\IMEXIT01.249

would cause Mail Server #1 to exit with errorlevel 249.

The IMSLEEP.NOW will temporarily put all Mailers to sleep, making
them suspend all activites and release the nodelist files. The
IMSLEEP.NOW is created by the IMNC and the FREENODE. The IMSLEEP.NOW
may be removed by FREENODE /U (Undo). This feature is very usefull
for nodelist updates in a multiline system.



Command Line Switches
---------------------
InterMail can also use a number of command line switches which are
added to your IMRUN.BAT. Some of the switches that are available with
InterMail are:

    /#[mail server #]  Load the Mailer as a specific mail server.
    /BSY:[path]        Enable support for Squish style *.BSY files.
    /L:[password]      Loads the Mailer with a keyboard password.
    /NF                No Fossil. Use InterMail's built-in SIO driver.
    /RDBG              Routing debug mode.
    /TIME              Display time stamp for messages on screen.
    /NOUNPACK          Prevents the Mailer from unpacking any mail.
    /RM1               RingMaster or "distinctive ringing" support.
                       InterMail can detect phone number 1 and 2 if
                       invoked with the parameters /rm1 or /rm2.
    /ZMAX:[block size] Set maximum block size for Zmodem.  Use 32,
                       64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 or 4096. Use if
                       you often get bad phone lines.

To setup Mail Server #1 with the built-in SIO driver and Squish type
*.BSY file support, you would need the following in your IMRUN.BAT:

    im /#1 /nf /bsy:c:\im\out.sq
