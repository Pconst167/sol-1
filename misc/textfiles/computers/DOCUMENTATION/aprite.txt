          rights that differ from the rights of the person calling the
          application.
          The complete system is based on NetWare security.

Features:
          -  Allow users to change user ID while 3rd party applications
             are run.
          -  Multiple security levels based on NetWare security.
          -  Management tool to administer and view the ApRite security.
          -  Built-in self test for virus infection.

*
Quick Start:
          Within 5 minutes you can get a quick impression of the
          capabilities of ApRun:

          1) Initiate ApRun:
                "ApRite /Install"
          2) Give a second user (e.g. GUEST) the right to run 
             SYSCON in your name: 
                "ApRite /Allow SYSCON GUEST" 
          3) Login as GUEST and run SYSCON (with/without ApRun):
                "ApRun SYSCON"

          If you want to remove GUEST's privileges you have two choices:

          4a) Login as Supervisor and revoke the privileges:
                "ApRite /Remove <nr>"      [Insert appr allowance nr]
          4b) Remove GUEST from the list of accepted masters:
                "ApRite /Master - GUEST"

Demo Version
          The 3 files APRITE.EXE, APRUN.EXE, and APRITE.DOC may 
          freely be copied to other file servers. But since ApRite 
          is a commercial application, unlicensed users may only 
          have a 60 days testing period.
          Within this period users can test all features of ApRite 
          on any number of file servers. 
          About 60 days after its installation on a server it will 
          disable itself. When the demo time is over, only the 
          options "ApRite /?" and "ApRite /Destroy" will remain 
          active. 
          Warning: if the demo version detects a file server date 
          change it might disable itself immediately.

*
Concepts:
          ApRite is using a concept called 'Application System' and its
          implementation in based on the NetWare concept of a 'Job
          Server'.

          ApRite uses the terms 'Application System', 'MASTER', 'SLAVE',
          'ADMINISTRATOR', 'COMMAND', and 'OPTIONS'. Usage of those terms
          must be explained shortly.

          Application System: The term 'application system' is used to
          describe the complete environment supplied by ApRite and ApRun
          to support rights granted to applications.
          The application system must be initialized by the Supervisor or
          an equivalent before users can access it.

          To explain the other concepts we will refer to some command
          lines as examples (assumed that U_M and U_S are valid user
          names):

          1) "ApRite /Allow SYSCON U_M"    issued by U_S (Slave)
          2) "ApRite /Allow FILER"         issued by U_S (Slave)
          3) "ApRun SYSCON"                issued by U_M (Master)

          SLAVE: A slave is a NetWare user who grants his/her NetWare
          rights to a master, whenever the master will call a specified
          program.
          A slave must have been admitted to the application system 
          by the SUPERVISOR ("ApRite /SLaves ..."). 
          The slave must have specified the commands (and its 
          accepted masters) that can be run in his/her name, before 
          any master can run an application in the name of a slave, 
          ("ApRite /Allow "). 
          In the example given above the user U_S gives the user U_M 
          the right to call SYSCON (command 1) - this means that U_M 
          will get the rights of U_S while running SYSCON. 
          Then U_S allows every legitimate application system master 
          to run FILER with the rights of U_S (command 2).

          MASTER: A master is a NetWare user who is logged in to a
          NetWare file server and wants to run an application with
          different rights than those that he usually has.
          Masters must have been admitted to the application system by
          the SUPERVISOR ("ApRite /Masters ...").
          A master can issue a program call with the rights of a 'slave'
          if the slave has allowed (this master) to run an application in
          his/her name.

          COMMAND/OPTIONS: A standard DOS command line usually 
          contains the (path and) name of an executable command with 
          or without additional options/parameters).
          The term 'Command' in this script includes all characters up to
          the first blank in the command line. It consists of an optional
          valid DOS path followed by a file name and it may include the
          extension of the application.
          The term 'Options' refers to everything that follows the first
          blank in the normal DOS call.

          ADMINISTRATOR: An application system administrator can 
          view and change the status of the application system. The 
          administrator can see all allowed applications, can remove 
          specific applications from the system, can halt or restart 
          the system. 
          By default only the person who installs the application 
          system is created as system administrator. 
          New administrators can be defined by the supervisor 
          ("ApRite /Admin ...").

*
Installation and Usage:

          -  Read the READ.ME file from the installation disk for
             information about the first steps;

          -  Copy all files from the installation disk to a NetWork
             directory;

          -  Setup the system by calling "ApRite /Install"

          -  Define legitimate slaves with  "ApRite /Slaves ..."
             (Users who give their rights to applications)

          -  Define legitimate masters with "ApRite /Masters ..."
             (Users who receive new rights in applications)

          -  A legitimate slave grants application rights with 
             "ApRite /Allow ..."

          -  Legitimate masters now can call "ApRun" to start the
             admitted applications.

*
Security:
          The application system includes several layers of protection to
          ensure that only accepted users get access to the system:

          -  only a Supervisor (or eqivalent) can initiate the system;

          -  only specified users can get access to the system; they must
             have been admitted to the system as 'slaves' or 'masters' by
             the supervisor;

          -  the user ('slave') who gives his rights to other users
             ('masters') must actively allow those users access to
             specified applications;

          -  only the specified applications can be called; use of these
             applications can be restricted to specified persons;

          -  the master can call the selected applications only if those
             applications have not been changed since access was granted;

          -  the supervisor or administrator can monitor and change the
             current status of the application system.

          -  the supervisor or an assigned 'administrator' can remove
             specified applications from the system;

          -  The automatic self test for virus infection will display a
             warning if ApRite.EXE is infected by a virus.

*
Multi-Server Environments

          The application system is always file server specific: ApRite 
          will define how rights may be changed on the current server. 
          ApRun will change the rights only for the current server.

          The current file server is defined by your current default 
          drive letter. ApRun will always modify rights on a single 
          server: the server of your default drive.

*
Syntax:      ApRite [/parameter]

          All options of ApRite can be abbreviated as long as those
          shortcuts are unique: "ApRite /I" or "ApRite /SH" are valid
          shortcuts.

          This overview presents optional parameters within square
          brackets "[xxx]", user supplied names (e.g. user names or
          commands) in angle brackets "<xxx>". Upper vs. lower case
          letters do not make any difference.

*
ApRite /?
          Display syntax overview 

          This command give an overview over the features and available 
          parameters of ApRite.EXE with basic explanations of their effects.

          Example:  ApRite /?

*
ApRite /Install
          Initiate or Re-Initiate application system

          Before using any of the following ApRite parameters the
          application system has to be established.

          The installation procedure will only take about a second and
          will initiate security and all relevant variables.
          None of the ApRite/ApRun application parts stays resident in a
          workstation's RAM. The application system uses similar bindery
          security as NetWare itself; it will store security information 
          in the NetWare bindery.

          WARNING: If "ApRite /Install" is issued a second time, it will 
          completely reset the application system: all masters, slaves, 
          administrators, or information about accepted applications will 
          be removed.
          You will be asked for confirmation if the application system is 
          already installed.

          This option is for supervisors only.

          Example:  ApRite /Inst
*
ApRite /Destroy
          Delete/Remove the complete application system

          This option can be used to completely remove the application
          system structure from your file server.
          The only way to recover from the effects of "/Destroy" is to
          restore the file server from a previous backup.

          This option is for supervisors only.

          Example:  ApRite /Dest

*
ApRite /Masters [+|- <user|group>]
          List/Define accepted application users

          See the discussion of the master-slave concept above. Masters
          are NetWare users that are allowed to take the identity and
          rights of a 'slave' while a program is executed. Only the users
          admitted to the application system as masters are allowed to
          run applications with the temporary ID of a slave.

          Before a slave can specify a user as master (that means before 
          he/she can allow a master to run the application in the slave's 
          name) the supervisor must have admitted both slave and master to 
          the application system. This is done with "ApRite /Slaves ..." 
          and "ApRite /Masters ..."

          Specifying '+' will add new masters, '-' will remove existing
          masters.

          Users and groups can be accepted as masters. If a group is 
          specified, ApRite will add or remove each group member 
          individually:  the call "ApRite /Masters - everyone" will 
          remove all masters.

          A slave with supervisor rights can implicitly add masters with
          the "/Allow" option (see there).  This feature applies to 
          supervisors only.

          Example:  ApRite /Master + guest
                    ApRite /Master - everyone
                    ApRite /Ma + guest

*
ApRite /SLaves [+|- <user|group>]
          List/Define users that are accepted as slaves

          See the discussion of the master-slave concept above. Slaves
          are NetWare users whose rights are granted to a master while 
          a program is executed. 

          Only the users admitted to the application system as slaves 
          are allowed to transfer their rights to a application user 
          (master).
          Before any slave can allow an application to be run in the
          slave's name, the supervisor must have admitted the user as
          slave to the application system. This is done with "ApRite
          /SLaves ..."

          Specifying '+' will add new slaves, '-' will remove existing
          slaves.

          Users and groups can be accepted as slaves.

          This option is for supervisors only.

          Example:  ApRite /Slave + guest
                    ApRite /Slave - guest
                    ApRite /SL + everyone

*
ApRite /ADmin [+|- <user|group>]
          List/Define application system administrators

          An administrator can monitor the status of the application
          system, view the list of accepted slaves, masters, and
          applications, and remove specific applications from the system.
          The administrator is comparable to a queue operator in the
          printing environment.

          Specifying '+' will add new administrators, '-' will remove
          existing administrators.

          Users and groups can be accepted as slaves.

          This option is for supervisors only.

          Example:  ApRite /Admin + guest

*
ApRite /ALlow  [command [<user>]]
          Allow [user] access to specified command

          The option "/Allow" enables a slave to specify, what command is
          allowed to be executed in his/her name. This option adds the
          new command to the list of accepted commands. An accepted
          master is thereby enabled to run this command in the name of
          the slave.

          The command must contain at least a valid filename; it may 
          include an optional drive/path specification and/or 
          extension. ApRite searches for the specified command file to 
          add it to its list, so the application must be in the default 
          drive or in one of the search drives, if no path is specified.

          The specified command can be located on a local drive or second
          file server, but the rights change will always affect only the
          current default server (i.e.: the server where the default 
          drive is located).

          If the application (and optional master) is accepted by the
          system, it will display the new list of accepted applications.
          Each registered application automatically receives a unique
          application ID. This ID can be used to remove specific
          applications from the system (if desired).

          All valid file names will be accepted, but only COM, EXE, and
          BAT files give sense.

          To use the parameter "/ALLOW" the user must be in the list of 
          accepted slaves, and he/she needs search/file scan rights in 
          the directory of the specified command.

          If no user is specified after the command, the application can
          be started by any accepted master. If the specified user is
          unknown or not accepted as master the command will not execute.

          If a supervisor equivalent specifies a user who is not a 
          registered master yet, the system will automatically add the 
          user to the master list.

          If "ApRite /ALlow" is not followed by a command, it will list
          the current accepted applications entered by the user.

          Only users - no groups - can be accepted as masters.

          This option is for supervisors and accepted slaves only.

          Example:  ApRite /Allow syscon
                    ApRite /Allow syscon.exe guest
                    ApRite /Al k:\sub\this.bat guest
*
ApRite /Remove <nr>
          Remove application from application system

          Every entry in the list of accepted applications can be
          identified by its entry ID. The IDs are constants and are
          assigned by NetWare.

          Applications can be removed from the system list by a system
          administrator or by the slave who added the entry to the list.

          This option is for supervisors and administrators only.

          Example:  ApRite /Remove 473
*
ApRite /STatus [Masters|Slaves  Pause|Continue]
          Show or change application system status

          Comprehensive system status information is displayed.

          In addition to the status display a supervisor or administrator
          can change its status.

          You can determine if slaves may add new jobs to the application
          system, or if masters may access the application system to
          acquire the slaves' rights.

          'ApRite /Status Masters Pause' will de-activate the application
          system without destroying any of the stored information:
          Currently active ApRun applications can be continued, but no
          master can start new ApRun commands. 'Continue' will
          re-activate the application system.

          'ApRite /Status Slaves Pause' will prevent slaves to add new
          applications to the application system. Masters still can access
          the system to acquire the slaves' rights. All exixting information
          will be kept.

          Examples: ApRite /Status
                    ApRite /St Masters pause
                    ApRite /St Slaves Cont
*
ApRite /SHow
          Show status and list current accepted applications

          '/SHow' will not only display the short status report, but
          additionally list the current accepted slaves, masters,
          administrators, and applications.

          This option is for supervisors and administrators only.

          Example:  ApRite /Show

*
ApRun <command> [parameter list]
          Run applications with another identity

          If an accepted master wants to start an accepted application in
          the name of a slave, the command must be launched by ApRun.
          Without ApRun the application would run with the default rights
          of the program caller.

          The command can be followed by the parameters as required by 
          the launched application's syntax. Use the normal command 
          syntax, and simply add 'ApRun' at the beginning of the command 
          line.

          Masters who want to launch applications need Search/File Scan
          rights in the application directory. If the command is not to
          be found in one of the master's search drives, it must include
          a drive/path specification.

          ApRun.EXE will use approximately 25 Kb of the workstation RAM 
          while the launched application is running. It therefore limits 
          the RAM available to that application. Since ApRun is not a TSR 
          program it will not stay in the workstation memory except 
          during the execution of the launched program.

          This option is for accepted masters only.

          Example:  ApRun SYSCON
                    ApRun NCOPY Z:*.* k: /sub
                    ApRun C:\this.bat par1 par2
*
Limitations:
          Due to NetWare limitations and ApRun's implementation there are
          several aspects administrators should keep in mind.

          -  Number of application configurations: The list of accepted
             application/rights configurations may include up to 250
             entries.

          -  Number of slaves running ApRun simultaneously on one file 
             server: 250

          -  Memory: since ApRun.EXE has to stay in memory while it
             changes the rights of a master to the rights of the slaves,
             and since it has to stay active until the original rights
             are restored, there is only a restricted area of RAM
             available to slave applications.
             Generally ApRun.EXE takes about 25 kB of RAM during the
             execution of slave applications. The RAM available to
             applications will be higher if those are COM or EXE files,
             a little less with BAT files (since ApRun uses COMMAND.COM
             to run batch jobs).
             If memory is a problem, you might consider to use 3rd party
             memory manager (like HIMEM, EMM386, or QEMM386) to load some
             drivers and TSRs to high memory areas. DOS v4.x will usually
             leave less memory to applications than DOS v3.x or v5.x.

          -  Multitasking: if ApRun were used in a multitasking 
             environment, ALL tasks would change to the slave's 
             identity as long as one task runs an application with 
             ApRun. Similar considerations apply to task switching 
             environments like DR-DOS v6.x or MS-DOS v5.x.
             To avoid bypassing of NetWare security, ApRun will not run 
             under Windows or in other multitasking environments.

          -  TSR programs: The complete station of the master will
             receive the rights and identity of the slave during program
             execution. Obviously this will affect TSRs that have been
             loaded previously, too. Therefore TSRs might in some cases
             represent a breach in security since they receive the same
             rights as the legitimate application.
             In most situations this will not be a problem.

          -  Application Updates / Program changes: If a slave allows
             access to an application ApRun tries to ensure that this
             program is run without any changes. Future masters can run
             the accepted application only in its current form (for
             security reasons). Any changes to the program will prevent
             masters from being able to start that application. The slave
             has to re-allow access whenever an application is modified.

          -  NetWare bugs: Due to a NetWare bug few NetWare commands 
             (e.g. SETPASS) will not execute with the ID of the 
             SLAVE but with the ID of the MASTER. This will only 
             affect commands that use a specific NetWare API 
             (GetConnectionInformation). Most commands however will 
             work as expected and run with the ID of the SLAVE.
             Novell is aware of this bug in NetWare v3.11 - and 
             hopefully fix it in a future NetWare version.


          Due to the above mentioned limitations the following
          suggestions are strongly recommended:

          -  Create special users who only have the rights to run one
             application. The trustee rights of those users might include
             only a single directory. Accept only those user names as
             slaves.
             Take into account that background applications (TSRs) 
             receive the slave's rights, too.

          -  Specify the name of the acceptable master in the 'Allow'
             command whenever possible.  This is especially recommended
             if the slave has supervisor rights.

Troubleshooting


General Problems


Problem:            An application is not executed though it has 
                    been installed with 'ApRite /Allow ...'
Possible Causes:    - The user does not have a search path to the 
                      application or does not have sufficient rights
                      (File Scan/Search rights may be enough).
Solution:           Check the user's path and rights.


Problem:            A virus warning is displayed.
Possible Causes:    - ApRite has a built in virus self-test. A virus
                      might have infected your system. 
                    - You have different versions of ApRite on your 
                      system.
Solution:           Run a virus scan utility immediately.

Message:            'Application list full'
Possible Causes:    The application system can save up to 250
                    applications. You exceeded this limit.
Solution:           Delete some unneeded applications from the list
                    with 'ApRite /Remove'.

Message:            'Application System not yet initialized'
Possible Causes:    ApRite is not yet installed on this server
Solution:           Install ApRite. Make sure that you have one
                    license per file server.

Message:            'ApRite-Demoversion.  Valid only .. days'
Possible Causes:    - You do not have a full version of ApRite but a 
                      limited demo version on this server. The time 
                      limit has expired.
Solution:           Purchase a full license.
Possible Causes:    - On a multi-server system you try to run ApRite
                      on another server than the one that you 
                      installed ApRite on. You may use ApRite for the
                      demo period but have to purchase a license for
                      every server that you permanently want to install 
                      ApRite on.
Solution:           Purchase a full license.

Message:            'Could not access Application System'
Possible Causes:    ApRite is not yet installed on this server
Solution:           Install ApRite. Make sure that you have one
                    license per file server.

Message:            'Demonstration time for ApRite on ... expired.'
Possible Causes:    You do not have a full version of ApRite but a 
                    limited demo version on this server. The time 
                    limit has expired.
Solution:           Purchase a full license.

Message:            '<username> is no accepted MASTER'
Possible Causes:    You tried to run ApRun but your are not accepted
                    as application master.
Solution:           Ask the supervisor to install you as ApRun
                    master ('ApRite /Master ...').

Message:            'Multitasking active'
Possible Causes:    You tried to run ApRun in an multitasking 
                    environment (e.g. Windows, DesqView, Task
                    Switcher). Due to security considerations this
                    is not accepted. 
Solution:           Start ApRun in a single task environment.

Message:            'Only a Supervisor can call this function !'
Possible Causes:    Some functions of ApRite are reserved for 
                    Supervisors and equivalents. 
Solution:           Login as supervisor and retry.

Message:            'Wildcards not acceptable'
Possible Causes:    You tried to run 'ApRite /Allow' with wildcards.
Solution:           Use only one application per command.
