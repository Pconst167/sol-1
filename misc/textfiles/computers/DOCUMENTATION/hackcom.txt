  HACKBBS - The Concept
  ----------------------
      A while back I was looking at a few text files which describe how to
  infiltrate bulletin boards thru backdoors and bugs in the software. I
  saw some good ideas for hacking SOME bulletin boards. HackBBS will allow
  you to hack nearly any bulletin board in existence using no bugs in the
  software, etc..  So, welcome to the latest in board hacking technology.
  Yea, stupid phrase, I know.


  How it works
  -------------
      This is a COM Only version of Hackbbs. I had a few problems with memory
  with the EXE version, but I do still expect to release it soon. I separated
  the versions so that the file size could be kept to a minimum. Anyway, what
  hackbbs does is install itself, along with a specified batch, com, or exe
  file, onto any COM file. The file you append to the COM file will be
  called the activation file from now on. This file CANNOT exceed 32k. If it
  does, then it will not execute properly once activated. I'm working
  on fixing this. ALSO, make sure that the infected COM file does not exceed
  the 64k boundary. The infected file will function normally until the
  key is located anywhere in the command line. At which time, hackbbs
  will take control and write the batch, com, or exe file which it attached
  to the program. It will then execute this file. HackBBS writes the file
  to disk as EXACTLY the same name you specified when infecting the file.
  If you used a path such as : "C:\TEST\RUNME.COM" then HackBBS will write
  the file to that directory and filename upon activation. If you did not
  specify a directory name, then hackbbs will write it to the current
  directory on the victim's computer. Confusing enough? Good, why make it
  simple when you can completly screw things over?

   Command Syntax for HACKBBS :
     HACKBBS [COMFILE] [COM_EXE_BAT] [KEY]

   -COMFILE is the name of the file you wish to infect
   -COM_EXE_BAT is the name of the activation file -LESS THAN 32k!
   -KEY is up to 8 characters which, when found on the command line,
    activate hackBBS. If you specify a key longer than 8 chars, only
    the first 8 characters will apply.

  How to use it
  --------------
      To use this program to hack into a board, simply run hackbbs on the
  COM file you wish to infect, using the above parameters. The activation file
  you create can do anything you wish. I'll leave it up to your imagination
  to think of the possiblities. One thing you MUST remember though, this
  program is not designed for re-entry into the executable. Therefore, once
  the batch file is run don't plan on returning to the COM file and
  continuing the process. I'd suggest removing all evidence and then
  rebooting his system. Anyway, an example of hacking a board would
  be :
      1) Create the batch file TEST.BAT containing :
         CTTY COM1
         (substitute the appropriate COM port)
      2) Extract the latest version of DSZ into a temporary directory.
         Infect DSZ.COM with a command line something like :
           HACKBBS C:\TEMP\DSZ.COM TEST.BAT ACTIVATE
      3) Be friendly, and upload it to the victim's board.
         (be sure to talk it up in the description, to make sure
          that he'll use it on his board)
      4) Call back whenever he's got it installed and upload him the
         file : ACTIVATE.ZIP using DSZ. Bam, boom, smack.. as soon
         as DSZ is run with "ACTIVATE" in the command line your batch
         file is written to disk and executed. Thus, redirecting
         standord I/O to COM1. You just got access to his/her DOS.
         You need to remember to delete all evidence of your infiltration.
         HackBBS will not return to the infected file and continue
         running. I suggest you reboot the victim's computer.

  Ofcourse, you could just write a batch file to format his HD, send
  his users data file, etc.. No limits. The best part is that HACKBBS
  can install itself onto any COM file, protocols, compression utils,
  upload processors, etc. The EXE version will be even more effective.


  Details & Warnings
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - DO NOT USE AN ACTIVATION FILE LARGER THAN 32k!
   - ALWAYS CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT AN INFECTED COM FILE DOES NOT
     EXCEED THE 64K BOUNDARY.
   - HackBBS was written in assembly, compiled by TASM v2.0.
   - When executing a batch file, hackbbs uses the command line :
       C:\COMMAND.COM /K [filename.BAT]
     Where [filename.BAT] is the filename of the file you appended
     to the COM.
   - When executing a COM or EXE file, hackbbs executes it directly.
   - No, I haven't tested it extensivly.
   - Nowhere Man's CRYPTCOM utility was used to encrypt the
      original executable (HACKBBS.COM). I then made a few
      unsignificant changes to deter debugging. (here CCh, there
      a CCh, everywhere a CCh)


  How to tell Virogen what a great program he wrote, or what a shitty
  piece of crap this thing is

  Simply leave me a message anywhere, and everywhere and eventually I'm
  bound to recieve it. You can leave a message to me on Fidonet (Virogen),
  Virus Conference, but I only scan it occaisionally.
