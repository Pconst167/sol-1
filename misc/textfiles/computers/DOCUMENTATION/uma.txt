     What is Useful Macros?
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Useful Macros is a program that will record and playback key sequences
     on your PC.  Keyboard macros allow you to speed up your work by
     reducing the number of keystrokes required to perform complex or
     repetitive tasks.  Useful Macros allows you to assign a sequence of
     keystrokes to one key or key combination.  This one key to many keys
     relationship is called a "macro".

     Almost any key can be redefined to perform one or more commands.  If 
     you were required to use a character string frequently (say the name 
     of your company), you could create a macro that "plays back" that 
     character string at the touch of a single key.  You can also create 
     macros that automatically play back at the start of an application.  
     Frequently used macros can be saved to and loaded from disk files.

     Macros are easy to create.  With Useful Macros you can record a series
     of keystrokes from within your application.  When you have finished
     recording, that macro is immediately available for use.  Another way
     you can generate macros is to create a "macro definition" file with
     any ASCII text editor (hopefully Useful Editor).  Utility programs to
     convert "macro files" to and from text files are included with the
     Useful Macros package.

     Macros are easy to play back.  When you press a macro's "hot key" (the
     key to which the macro has been assigned) each keystroke, command, or
     instruction is carried out (starting at the current cursor position)
     just as if you typed them yourself.  With Useful Macros another way to
     invoke a macro is to type the first few keys of any macro then press
     the "macro completion" key.  In either case after the macro has run,
     you can resume working in the application as you normally would.


     Features
     ~~~~~~~~

     Useful Macros (Uma) is a small (about 15K) keyboard macro program for
     IBM PCs and compatibles.  Some of Uma's features include:

        - run as a TSR or from the command line
        - record and playback keystrokes or use pre-defined macro scripts
        - macro completion
        - support for enhanced keyboards
        - macros can be synchronized with screen events
        - macro files can be loaded and saved "on-the-fly"
        - autostart macro when program loads
        - optionally record the delays between keystrokes
        - optionally record changes to the shift key status
        - macro files can be up to 64K in size
        - easy to use consistent interface
        - user configurable preferences



     System Requirements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Uma runs on any IBM PC or compatible.  Uma automatically determines
     the type of video card installed and uses the current text mode for
     its menu.  The following video cards (or ones that are compatible)
     are supported:

        - Color Graphics Adapter (CGA)
        - Monochrome Graphics Adapter (MGA)
        - Hercules Graphics Adapter (HGA)
        - Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA)
        - Video Graphics Array (VGA)
        - Multi-Color Graphics Array (MCGA)

     Any monitor that can display text works with Uma.  If you have a color
     monitor and card, you can change the default colors by running
     umacfg.exe (see Configuring Uma).  In addition Uma supports a 43 line
     display on EGA systems and a 28 or 50 line display on VGA systems.

     Uma is very small and runs on systems with as little as 128K of
     memory.  Of course the more memory that you have, the larger the macro
     files that you are able to work with (up to 64K).


     Starting Up Uma
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     There are two versions of Useful Macros.


     UMARES will load itself and an associated "macro" file into memory as
     a "terminate and stay resident" program (TSR).  To run Umares, from
     the DOS prompt, type:

        umares [<macrofile[.uma]>]

     then press the Enter key.  From this point on, any keyboard macro
     defined in the "macrofile" will be available to you.  To remove Umares 
     from memory you must restart your system.


     UMARUN can be used to execute another application with an associated
     "macro" file.  To run Umarun, from the DOS prompt, type:

        umarun <macrofile[.uma]> <application> [<parm1> <parm2>...<parmn>]

     then press the Enter key.  The parms above are the application's (if
     any) just as you would type them in at the DOS prompt.  As long as you
     remain in the application you will have access to the macros defined
     in "macrofile.uma".  When you exit the application, Umarun will remove
     itself and the macro file from memory.

     For both versions if you do not specify an extension on the macrofile
     name, Uma will assume ".uma".

     NOTE: If you already have UMARES in memory it will take override
           UMARUN.



     Command Line Options
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     There are a number of command line parameters that can be used when
     running either Umares or Umarun.

     /A     - When this option is used, Uma will immediately "play back"
     (Auto    the FIRST macro found in the macro file.
      Start)

     /Bnnnn - Specifies the amount of memory (in characters) to set aside
     (Buffer  for macro files.  If this option is omitted, Useful Macros
      Size)   will set aside enough memory to load the macro file plus
              enough to record about 250 additional keystrokes.  In the
              case of Umares, if /B is not used and there is no macro file,
              only the 250 key "recording buffer" will be allocated.

     /D     - Instructs Useful Macros to record the delays between
     (Delay)  keystrokes.  When you play back a macro recorded in this
              manner, the keys will appear at the same speed that you typed
              them in.

     /E     - Enable extended keyboard services.  If you have a newer
              machine, you will need to set this switch to use the F11,
              F12, and other extended keys on your keyboard.

     /F     - Most applications ask the PC's BIOS service routines if a key
     (Force)  has been typed then make a subsequent request for that key if
              there is one.  Think of this as "on demand".  Some
              applications however, "look" directly at the PC's keyboard
              buffer for keystrokes and "grab" them from the buffer when
              they appear.  Uma defaults to "on demand" mode feeding the
              applications keys when they are requested.  The /F command
              line option can be used to "force" keys directly into the
              keyboard buffer where they can be "seen" by the second type
              of application.  If your application does not work in the
              default mode try the /f option.



     Command Line Options (continued)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     /S     - Instructs Useful Macros to record any changes to the status
     (Shift   of the shift keys (Ctrl, Alt, Left Shift, and Right Shift).
      Change)


      EXAMPLES:

        umares mymacros

            - Loads Uma and the file "mymacros.uma" permanently into memory
              with enough extra space to record an additional 250 keys.

        umarun /b5000 /f cmacros /a ued myfile.c

            - Loads Uma and the file "cmacros.uma" and then runs the
              program Ued and passes to it the file name myfile.c.  Enough
              room for about 2500 keystrokes has been set aside.  The free
              space for recording additional keystrokes would be 2500 minus
              the number of keys in the "cmacros.uma" file.  Useful Macros
              will "force" keys directly into the keyboard buffer and auto-
              matically "play back" the first macro from "cmacros.uma".
              When you quit Ued, Useful Macros will remove itself and the
              macro file from memory.



     Using Uma
     ~~~~~~~~~

     Once Useful Macros has been loaded into memory, you can access the Uma
     menu by pressing Ctrl-Alt-M (the Ctrl, Alt, and M keys at the same
     time).  You should see the line:

     Pause  Record  Clear  Load  Save                    Useful Macros v1.0

     appear at the top of your screen.  To "hide" the menu and return to
     your application press the Esc key.

     Press the first letter of any command (P,R,C,L,S for the main menu) to
     invoke that command.  The commands are:

     Pause  - Temporarily suspend the current operation.  If you were
              recording a macro, any keys pressed while "paused" will not
              be added to the macro buffer.  Similarly Pause can be used to
              suspend the "play back" of a macro.  If Pause is invoked at
              any other time, macro "hot keys" and command completion are
              temporarily disabled.  When the Pause key is pressed you are
              immediately returned to your application.  You must "pop up"
              the menu again to resume.

     Resume - When Useful Macros has been "Paused" the menu will have only
              one option;

              P Resume                                      Status: PAUSED

              Press P to resume whatever operation was in effect prior to
              pausing.

     Record - Start recording a new macro.  You will be prompted for a key
              to bind the macro to.  This "hot key" can be used to "run"
              the macro at a later time.  Once you assign a key, you are
              immediately returned to your application and recording.  You
              must "pop up" the menu again when you are done.  While Useful
              Macros is "Recording" the only options on the menu will be:

              Pause  Stop                                Status: RECORDING

              Pause is as described above.  Stop is used to end the macro
              recording session.  Once stopped, the macro you just recorded
              will be available for use by pressing it's "hot key".

     Clear  - Clear can be used to erase an existing macro.  You will be
              prompted for the "hot key" of the macro to erase.

     Load   - Use the load command to switch to another macro file.  You
              will be prompted for the name of the macro file to load.
              There must be enough memory set aside when you started up Uma
              to load the new macro file or you will get an error.  The new
              file is loaded on top of the old file.

     Save   - Save is used to save the macros currently in memory to a disk
              file.  You will be prompted for the disk file name.  If you
              do not include an extension on the file name, ".uma" will be
              added.



     While Running Uma
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Here are some other things you should know about running Uma.

     You can use the Alt+ (Alt and + keys together) as a shortcut to start
     the Recording of a macro.  It's as though you popped up the Uma menu
     then pressed the R key.  Similarly you can use Alt- to stop recording
     a macro.

     When you are "playing back" a macros, you can press the Esc key at any
     time to immediately stop the playback.

     If the internal buffer becomes full while recording, Useful Macros
     will "beep" each time you press a key.  You should stop the recording,
     save the macros already recorded to a file, and reload Uma and the
     macro file with a larger buffer (using the /b command line argument).

     When a key definition for a "hot key" appears in a macro, the key and
     NOT the macro it represents will be played back.

     If you need to use a key that has been defined as a "hot key" (even 
     Ctrl-Alt-M) when Useful Macros is active you can:

     1) Temporarily disable Uma by Pausing (Ctrl-Alt-M then P), type the
        key, then Resume (Ctrl-Alt-M then P again).

     2) Enter the key by holding down the Alt key and typing in its "key
        number" on the keypad.


     Macro Completion
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     When a macro file has been loaded, the macros within can be run by
     pressing their "hot keys", or by using macro completion.

     The ` key (single back quote) is used to invoke macro completion.
     When ` is pressed Useful Macros looks at the text in front of the
     current cursor position (up to 10 characters worth by default) and
     tries to match that text against the beginnings of all of the macros
     currently in memory.  If a match is found, the macro is "completed" as
     though the "hot key" had been pressed.

     Useful Macros will look for the best match; the one with the MOST
     matching characters.  If two macros match equally well, the one which
     appears first in the macro file will be completed.

     To generate the  `  itself in your text file you can:

     1) Temporarily disable Uma by Pausing (Ctrl-Alt-M then P).

     2) Enter  `  by holding down the Alt key and typing 096 on the keypad.
     


     Creating Macro Files
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     There are a couple of ways to create a macro file.

     The easiest way would be to run Umares with a big enough buffer to
     store all of the macros you want to create.  Each keystroke requires 2
     characters in the buffer.  For example:

        umares /b1000

     would allocate enough memory to record about 500 keystrokes.

     Using the Record command, create the macro definitions.  Then use the
     Save command to copy the definitions to a disk file.

     Another way to create a macro file is to start with a text description
     of the macros.  A utility program, "TXT2UMA" has been provided to
     convert properly formatted text files (macro definitions) into macro
     files.  A macro definition file might look something like this:

        A macro to type out 2 lines of text.

        Macro:<Shift F1>
        This is line one.<Enter>
        This is line two.<Enter>
        Endmacro

        A macro to type out column headings.

        Macro:<Shift F2>
        <Tab>Column1<Tab><Tab>Column2<Tab><Tab>Column3<Enter><Enter>
        Endmacro

     Any text "outside of" the Macro: and Endmacro lines will be treated as 
     comments.  The Macro and Endmacro statements must start in column 1 
     and leading spaces between these two lines will be treated as part of
     the macro itself.  If the above text file were named "mymacros.txt",
     the following command line:

        txt2uma mymacros

     would create a macro file "mymacros.uma" (with the .txt file
     unchanged).

     If you want to alter an existing macro file, the utility "UMA2TXT"
     will convert it into a text file that can be edited with any text
     editor (like Useful Editor).

     To convert the macro file "mymacros.uma" into an editable text file
     the the following command line:

        uma2txt mymacros

     can be used to create the text file "mymacros.txt".

     The next 2 sections list the Key Definitions and Key Commands that can
     be used in a "macro definition" text file.

     Key Commands
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~

     In addition to the above key definitions the following key commands
     are supported by Useful Macros:

     <No Key>   - When this command is encountered within a macro, Uma will
                  simulate and empty keyboard buffer.  This is necessary
                  for some applications that periodically "flush" the key-
                  board buffer.  Can also be used as a "hot key" if the
                  Macro definition will only be used in "macro completion"
                  mode.  You cannot "Clear" a macro that has <No Key> for a
                  "hot key".


     <Delay:n>  - Delay for "n" tics before playing back the next key.  A
                  tic is the "heartbeat" unit of time used by PCs and is
                  about 1/18 of a second.


     <Delay All:n>

                - Delay for "n" tics after playing back each key.  This
                  command can be used to "pace" the playback of keystrokes
                  or can be helpful for debugging purposes.  You can
                  disable <Delay All> by specifying a value of 0 for "n".


     <Pause>    - Pause the playback until ANY key is pressed.


     <Pause Until:n><key 1><key 2>...<key n>

                - Pause the playback until ONE of the "n" keys that follow
                  are pressed.  All other keys pressed are passed through
                  to the application.


     <Print Screen>

                - Do a screen dump of the current screen.




     Key Commands (Continued)
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~


     <Alt>      - Change the shift status to simulate an Alt key being
                  pressed.


     <Ctrl>     - Change the shift status to simulate a Ctrl key being
                  pressed.


     <Left Shift>

                - Change the shift status to simulate a Left Shift key
                  being pressed.


     <Right Shift>

                - Change the shift status to simulate a Right Shift key
                  being pressed.


     <Shift Clear>

                - Clear the shift status.

 
     <Match Screen:row,column,text>

                - Wait until the "text" appears on the screen at the
                  location specified by "row" and "column".  The top row
                  and leftmost column of the screen are 1,1 and columns are
                  assumed to be 80 characters wide.  Everything between the
                  second  ,  and the closing  >  including spaces will be
                  treated as the "text" string to be matched.  This feature
                  can be especially useful for applications that clear out
                  the keyboard buffer while waiting for specific events to
                  occur.




     A Useful Macros Example
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     If you want to give Useful Macros a test drive, you might try the file
     "mkmacro.uma".  This is a macro file to help you make macro definition
     files.  Here's what to do.

     1) Type in the following command at the DOS prompt:

           umarun mkmacro <your text editor>

        In other words have Umarun load the macro file "mkmacro.uma" then
        run your favorite text editor.

     2) Type the letters  ma  then press the  `  (single back quote) key.
        You should see the letters  ma  replaced with the word  Macro:  .
        The  `  key you will recall is the "macro completion" key.

     3) Now select a "hot key", say Shift F1.  When you press the key you
        will notice that it's full text description is typed.  If you
        choose Shift F1 you should see the line  Macro:<Shift F1>  .

     4) Press the Enter key to advance to the next line.  Notice that the 
        definition <Enter> is NOT typed.  For the convenience of editing 
        the text, the Enter and Backspace keys are not mapped to their key 
        definitions in "mkmacro".  You can however generate an <Enter> by
        typing  en  then pressing the "completion" key (`).  Likewise a
        <Backspace> can be generated by using the  bs  short form.

     5) Type in the body of the macro.  Regular text keys (alpha, digits,
        and punctuation) appear as typed.  Special keys (functions, cursor
        controls, and editing) generate their text key definitions.  If you
        want to enter a key command, you can use one of the following short
        forms (along with the "macro completion" feature):

        nk - <No Key>
        de - <Delay:n> The macro will wait after the : is typed for you to
             key in the delay time (1-255) then press Enter.
        pa - <Pause>
        pu - <Pause Until:n> The macro will wait after the : is typed for
             you to key in number of keys to pause for (1-255) then press
             Enter.
        ps - <Print Screen>
        sc - <Shift Clear>
        al - <Alt>
        ct - <Ctrl>
        ls - <Left Shift>
        rs - <Right Shift>
        ma - Macro:
        em - Endmacro

     6) When you are done, use the  em  short form to end the macro.
        Remember the Endmacro must appear at the beginning of a seperate
        line.

     7) Try playing back the macro you have created.

     You might want to look at the file "mkmacro.txt" to see how the "short
     forms" and other macros above were created.
     


     Configuring Uma
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     A separate program (umacfg.exe) is provided to modify Umares and/or
     Umarun with some of your own preferences.  When you run this Uma
     Configuration, you must ensure that Umares.exe and/or Umarun.exe are
     in the current directory.  Follow the prompts for the configuration
     program.  When you have answered the last question the executable(s)
     will be updated with your selections.

     The following user preferences can be configured within Uma:

        - video display mode (snowchecked or not)
        - color of normal text
        - color of inverse text
        - number of characters to check for macro completion

     FORM on next page) to:

        Useful Software
        340 Dale Crescent
        Waterloo, Ontario
        Canada, N2J 3Y3

     The shareware fee pays for unlimited use of Uma by a single person.
     You are allowed (and encouraged) to give away copies of Uma with the
     understanding that each person receiving a copy is under the same
     obligation as you are to send in the shareware fee if they decide to
     keep it.  You can upload THIS VERSION ONLY of Uma to other computer
     systems, either free or commercial, as long as this archive remains
     intact, with the copyright and shareware notices unchanged.

     Useful Macros can be installed on LANS.  In such situations I ask only
     that the LAN Administrator estimate the maximum number of people that
     will be making "simultaneous" use of Uma and pay the shareware fee
     based on that estimate.  I do not expect that the limit be closely
     monitored or enforced (I appreciate how much trouble that would be),
     but I do expect that the estimate will be revised (and additional fees
     paid) should a substantial increase in the number of nodes on the LAN
     and Uma usage occur.

     No guarantee is made as to the functionality of this software; however
     it has been tested quite thoroughly by a large number of people.  If
     it doesn't do what you want, don't keep it and send no money.

     Please support the shareware concept.  Shareware means useful programs
     at a fraction of the cost you might pay for them commercially.  You
     can try-before-you-buy, and you are not subjected to copy protection
     or other atrocities that many software vendors inflict on their
     customers.  Software updates can also be distributed much faster than
     is possible through normal channels.

     Any questions, suggestions, or bug reports, can be mailed to the above
     address, or send electronic mail to:

     Update Log
     ~~~~~~~~~~

     The following changes were made in Version 1.1

        - added <Delay All:n> command
        - modified the <No Key> command to simulate an empty keyboard
          buffer
        - added support for keys generated via the Alt-keypad
          (ie. keys with a scan code of 0)
        - fixed an infrequent "hanging" problem with one of the interrupt
          handlers
        - fixed a problem with UMARUN thinking there were parameters to
          the application being run when there were not
        - UMA2TXT and TXT2UMA now understand extended HP95 keystrokes


     Planned Enhancements
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        - add number of keystrokes left in the buffer to the RECORDING
          status
        - add "call" and "chain" key commands so that macros can be
          combined
