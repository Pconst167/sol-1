        Spearwood Shareware Service is our authorized Australian dealer.
        They will forward your order to the USA and you will receive the
        absolute latest version of DOSREF by airmail straight from the
        author.  This means there will be about a three week delay before
        your order arrives.  We appreciate your business!

        Spearwood is our dealer only; for support write or E-mail the
        author, Dave Williams, at the above address.

   Why support DOSREF instead of relying on one of those public domain
 "interrupt lists"?  Sheer size, for one.  Even in LHarc format DOSREF
 bulks out to over a megabyte, making it too large for most sysops to
 consider keeping online.  Registered users also get support via:

        The Courts of Chaos BBS (TechRef support board)
        RIME/RelayNet
        BIX
        CompuServe
        airmail

  You get the very latest edition of this manual on disk, with no worries
 about corrupted or tampered text.  DOSREF is a quality product, in use
 by the US Navy, CalTech, Borland, NEC, Wang, General Motors, Citicorp,
 Rockwell, Honeywell, Digital Research, Central Point Software, 20th Century
 Fox, Associated Press, hospitals, universities, and government agencies
 around the world.

  The Registered User reference consists of over a megabyte of the compressed
 technical reference, appendices, and sample source code. That's about three
 megabytes of raw data when uncompressed, or several times larger than the
 shareware version.

  The Registered User version contains information on device drivers, mouse
 programming, Virtual Control Program Interface, Microsoft Windows 2.x, hard
 drives, hardware information, virus and Trojan programs, EMS 3.2, LIM 4.0,
 EEMS 3.2, CD-ROM, network programming, DOS 5.0, and more.

  Registered users will be advised by mail of updates.

  Several people who have downloaded copies over three years old have written
 to see if I was still supporting the Reference.  The answer is yes.  Not only
 that, but my book contract calls for keeping the information current.  If
 you're concerned, just drop a postcard.

 Foreign langauge versions are available!

  Klaus Overhage of Stuttgart, West Germany has licensed DOSref for
 redistribution and is now able to provide versions in German.  Klaus' version
 is a separate product from this one and must be purchased separately. Klaus
 is providing full support for German users.  If you'd like a copy in German,
 please contact:

                             Klaus Overhage

                             Germany

  I hope to have other languages available soon.  If you are interested in
purchase or translation, please contact me for details.

  For payment in British pounds, Canadian dollars or EuroCheques, see
 INVOICE.TRF and PAYMENT.  I fully support foreign users!  If you're having
 trouble arranging payment, write (or leave EMail) and I'll try to work
 something out.

  Do you live outside the US?  If so, you're probably familiar with the
 hassles of keeping up with the latest information - the three to five month
 lead time for US publication, plus time for local book dealers to catalog
 new releases, plus problems in trying to order... plus the delays while your
 book comes in on special order, goes through Customs, the inevitable price
 hikes through all the middlemen, taxes...  not only is DOSREF priced
 well below the price of good printed computer books in the US, it's probably
 far cheaper than you could expect to pay for US books locally.  Plus your
 order will show up in your very own mailbox by air mail.
