           DESCRIPTION
                  A 20 MB fixed disk and a 1.2 MB 5.25" diskette drive are
           standard on the PC XT Model 286.  One additional diskette drive may
           be internally installed as the B drive from the following new
           offerings:
           o   One 3.5" Internal Diskette Drive (mutually exclusive with the
               4865 Model 2, 3.5" External Diskette Drive).
           o   One High Capacity Diskette Drive
           o   One 5.25" 360 KB Diskette Drive
                  New special features further enhance the performance and
           function of the PC XT Model 286.
           3.5" INTERNAL DISKETTE DRIVE
           This feature is a half-high, double-sided, 3.5" diskette drive that
           supports the 3.5" media with 720 KB of storage capacity.  The drive
           utilizes the standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter provided
           on the PC XT Model 286.  When installed, the drive becomes the "B"
           drive.  Initial Program Loading (IPL) from the 3.5" diskette is not
           supported by the PC XT Model 286.  For operation, DOS users require
           DOS 3.2 on a 5.25" diskette or fixed disk.  The 3.5" Internal
           Diskette Drive is mutually exclusive with the 4865 Model 2, 3.5"
           External Diskette Drive.
           HIGH CAPACITY DISKETTE DRIVE
           The High Capacity Diskette Drive is a half-high, 5.25", dual-sided
           drive with 1.2 MB of storage capacity.  This drive is compatible with
           the standard drive provided with the PC XT Model 286 in the "A"
           position.  When installed as the second drive, the High Capacity
           Diskette Drive becomes the "B" drive.  This drive utilizes the
           standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter provided on the PC XT
           Model 286.
           5.25" 360 KB DISKETTE DRIVE
           This half-high, 5.25" diskette drive permits the exchange of
           information between the PC XT Model 286 and other members of the IBM
           PC family.  The drive is a dual-sided drive with 360 KB of storage
           capacity.  When installed, the drive becomes the "B" drive.  This
           drive utilizes the standard fixed disk and diskette drive adapter
           provided on the PC XT Model 286.
           SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
           The IBM PC XT Model 286 processor is up to 2.5 times faster
           internally than the prior PC XT family and up to 20 percent faster
           than the Personal Computer AT (R) Model 239, depending upon specific
           applications.
