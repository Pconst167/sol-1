			    PAUSE ON THE 68000
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This hack works on all computers with a Motorola 68000 processor!
(Amiga, Mac, Atari)   Well i will describe it as it's on the Amiga!

First remove the shell! (Ya warrenty will go to hell) find the processor
(On the Amiga 500 it's located at the left side, On the 1000 it's on the
right side, I don't know where it's on the 2000!) solder a wire on pin 17

	  
	The notch means that the pin 1 is on this side
	(start to count from the little dot!)

Thats it!   It's not dangerous to pause the computer as some guys thinks
Even if it can look strange sometimes (even crash sometimes) but that
depends how the programmer have done some things! (like showing bitmaps
and so on!)

The DMA is not stopped with this pause so for example sounds and copperlist
will go on on the Amiga (not musics like soundtracker then just the sounds
will go on but no new will come cause it's a little program but the
processor is halted so no new data will come!)

This feature can be good if you reads for example a scrolltext and the
phone is ringing then you just have to pause or if you want to check
how some guys have made some effects in a proggy

If you are not good at soldering let someone who is good to solder in your
computer!

AND DON'T USE A SOLDER IRON WITH A HIGHER WATTAGE OF 25 WATT!!!
