Silencing the noisy PCjr disk drive is as easy as lubricating two rods
inside your computer. The drive head carriage hangs on two rods and
sometimes hangs up, causing the noise. The rods are lubricated with Silicone
grease or Teflon oil. Radio Shack sells the Teflon oil as "Pecision Oiler".
Machine oil (3-in-One) is ok, but may cause some corrosion and generally
won't last as long. One final caution- Don't touch or get any lubricant
on the drive heads themselves.
