                              Young and Young-at-heart

                YouthNet is an international network that gears itself to
          the interests of the "young and young at heart".  We have echos
          designed to allow young people to talk with other young people
          around the world. The echos covers a wide range of topics from
          entertainment to fantasy to science. Everything from learning how
          to have fun all the way to having fun while learning. Which ever
          your preference may be, there is a place for you in YouthNet.

                But young people around the world are not the only ones
          interested in young people. Many adults are either "young at
          heart" or have serious interest in how the next generation of
          adults are doing. What are they interested in, how are they
          dealing with in today's society, what do they think of where our
          planet is heading? There are many places for these people to talk
          with others like them and even the young people themselves!

                Besides our own forums, we have gateway arrangements with
          both DiscNet and WorldNet. Several echos are passed between these
          networks, giving you greater reach with a single message.
          Messages can be sent person to person within YouthNet and even to
          individuals in these other networks. Many other ideas are
          currently being considered and discussed in the both the sysop
          and coordinators echos. You input to the growth of YouthNet will
          be most welcomed.

                We are a young network ourselves, with coverage in many
          places around the country and in Canada. However there are still
          many cities where we are in need of interested people to serve as
          Coordinators to help our network grow. So even if there isn't a
          YouthNet system in your city, there is no reason why you still
          can join.

                I hope to hear from you soon. Please feel free to contact me
          if you have any questions I may be able to help you with. Later!
