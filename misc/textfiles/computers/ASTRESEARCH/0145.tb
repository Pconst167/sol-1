                 RAMPAGE CONFLICT WITH IBM PC I


An  incompatibility exists between the AST Rampage!  product  and 
the  IBM  PC-1  (with 64K motherboard).   The  problem  has  been 
isolated  to  those machines with the early ROM  BIOS,  which  is 
dated 1981.

The  user  will  get a "PARITY CHECK 2" error as the  machine  is 
booting.   The message appears on the screen as the REMM.SYS file 
is executing.

One  solution to this problem is the use of the "/X" option  when 
configuring  REMM.SYS  file.   The exact command should  read  as 
follows:

                  DEVICE=REMM.SYS /X=8800-A000

This  will  keep REMM from "looking at" RAM between  the  top  of 
conventional  memory  (544K  on  the early  PC's)  and  the  640K 
boundary, where REMM would normally start checking. 

Another  solution  to this problem is to obtain from IBM the  ROM 
BIOS update kit.   The "/X" part of the above command should  not 
be used.
