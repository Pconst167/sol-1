               REMM.SYS DRIVER AND MICROSOFT WINDOWS


A problem occurs when attempting to use Microsoft WINDOWS version 
1.01  and  the device driver REMM.SYS version  2.08.  Using  this 
version  of  REMM.SYS with WINDOWS will cause the cursor icon  to 
disappear and the computer to "lock-up".

This  version  of  REMM.SYS  is part of  the  utilities  diskette 
labeled  "Rampage Expanded Memory Programs (version)  1.10,  plus 
SUPERPAK utilities (version) 5.02.  If there are any questions as 
to  which  version  of REMM.SYS is being  used,  the  version  of 
REMM.SYS  can be read as the program is executing  during  "boot-
up".

The  conflict  between  these  two programs can  be  resolved  by 
acquiring  versions  6.0  or   above of  the  SUPERPAK  utilities 
diskette.
