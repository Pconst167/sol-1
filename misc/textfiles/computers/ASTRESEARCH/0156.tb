           AST-5251/11 BOARDS WITH IBM 3179 TERMINALS


Installing  an  AST-5251/11 board on a port from the  System  34, 
which  already  has existing 3179 terminals on it,  requires  the 
following procedure.   If the AST 5251/11 board is to be the last 
physical   device,   normal  installation  procedures  should  be 
followed.

If  the  AST-5251/11  board is physically located  anywhere  else 
other than the end, it is recommended to put a terminator plug at 
the end of the line.

Failure to do so could result in the 3179 terminals going out  of 
service whenever the AST emulation package is executed.
