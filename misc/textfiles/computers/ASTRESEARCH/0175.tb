                     AST 5251/11 / PRINTERS


Some  customers  using  AST  5251/11  are  experiencing  problems 
getting  their  locally attached printer to do  special  printing 
through emulation (i.e., bold face, italics, etc.).  In the event 
that  you  are  encountering a problem similar  to  this,  please 
consider the following:

     1.  Be  sure  that your locally attached printer  has 
         the  capability to do the kind of printing  which 
         you request.  
               
     2.  Determine and send to the printer,  through  DOS, 
         the  HEX  sequence which will output the  desired 
         type  of  print.   This will verify that you  are 
         using  the  correct HEX sequence and the  printer 
         has the desired capability.

     3.  Bring up the AST configuration  file,  "CFG5251", 
         go into the 'printer strings' menu,  and edit the 
         HEX  sequence  for the desired printing and  save 
         this configuration.
