When  the 310A monitor is connected to the IBM-PC (or compatible) 
and  the character display is generated,  a sympton can occur  in 
which the character display cannot be seen on the monitor.   This 
symptom  can also occur when switching modes as with  a  Hercules 
Graphics  Card.   Should this problem occur with your monitor  we 
recommend one of the following solutions:

     SHORT TERM SOLUTION:  Be sure to always turn on the computer 
     first, then the monitor.

     LONG   TERM  SOLUTION:    Locate  resistor  R-203   on   the 
     motherboard inside the monitor.   Disconnect or  cut one leg 
     of the resistor from the motherboard.  (When viewed from the 
     rear   R-203  is  at  the  top  right  hand  corner  of  the 
     motherboard.)

This  modification  of  the  310A will  not  void  the  two  year 
warranty.  If you have questions or need additional assistance in 
making  this  modification  please  call  our  technical  support 
department at (312) 595-6890.
