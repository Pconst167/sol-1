                 RECEIVING A FILE USING AST 3780


The  purpose of this Technical Bulletin is to assist users of the 
AST 3780 package with the following symptom:  The PC is unable to 
receive a file from the host.   In technical terms,  the host has 
sent many ENQs to the PC.  The PC is not responding to the host's 
ENQs.  Therefore, the PC fails to respond to the host.

This symptom will occur under the following conditions:

     1)  The operator is using the menu drive (IP) section
         of the software.

     2)  The user is in the receive mode.

     3)  The host is trying to transmit to the PC.

     4)  The user has versions 4.6 or 4.8 of the software.

AST  has two possible suggestions to enable the user  to  receive 
the file successfully.   Either suggestion will solve the symptom 
described above.

     1)  Place the modem in the analog loopback mode.  Bring 
         up the IP section of the AST 3780 software.   Press 
         the Fl Fl F10 function keys.  Put the modem and the 
         3780  package  into  their  standard  setting   for 
         receiving a file.
     
     2)  Transmit  a file to the host first,  then receive a 
         file back to the PC.
