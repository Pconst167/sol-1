           ASTCLOCK AND COMPAQ VERSION 2.11 CONTENTION


When  using ASTCLOCK with COMPAQ's MS-DOS Version 2.11,  the year 
will  be  incremented  by one if the month is set  with  a  value 
greater than nine.

There are two solutions to this problem.     A)  Use PC-DOS or B)  
Don't  use  ASTCLOCK.   This  should  not be  a  problem  because 
COMPAQ's MS-DOS Version 2.11 will access our clock directly.
