                   DESQVIEW / EPSON EQUITY II



DESQview Versions 1.03 and 1.11 do not function properly with the
EPSON  Equity II.   The symptom is the Alt key function does  not
switch  to the DESQview opening menu.   This is the same  symptom
that occurred with DESQview Versions 1.02 and 1.10 when used with
the  new IBM PC/XT and PC/AT.   That problem was  rectified  with
DESQview Versions 1.03 and 1.11.
