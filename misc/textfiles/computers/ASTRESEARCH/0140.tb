                           FOURPORT/XN


Two  FOURPORT/XN boards cannot share the same interrupt.   Due to 
current  hardware  and software designs,  when two  FOUR  PORT/XN 
boards share the same IRQ, the boards's IRQ drivers conflict with 
each other.   As a result,  the interrupt request may not be seen 
by the IRQ controller and,  therefore,  may never be serviced  by 
the processor.
