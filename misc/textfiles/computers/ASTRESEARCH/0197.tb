                 DESQVIEW COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM


DESQVIEW COMPATIBILITY PROBLEM

6 new models of the IBM PC-XT and 2 new models of the IBM PC-AT 
were announced by IBM on April 2, 1986:

     o  PC-XT: New Models # 267, 268, 277, 278, 088, 089

     o  PC-AT: New Models # 319, 339

These new models offer such enhancements as bigger hard disks, 
more system board memory, faster speed operation, and
support for the enhanced personal computer keyboard (101 keys).

SUPPORT FOR THE NEW ENHANCED KEYBOARD BUILT INTO THE NEW ROM BIOS 
CHIPS INCLUDED IN ALL 8 OF THE ABOVE MACHINES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO BOOT DESQVIEW 1.02 AND DESQVIEW 1.10 ON THESE MACHINES WITHOUT 
MAKING A MODIFICATION TO THE DESQVIEW SOFTWARE. THIS IS 
INDEPENDENT OF WHETHER OR NOT THESE MACHINES ACTUALLY COME WITH 
THE ENHANCED KEYBOARD.

Specifically, the new XT and AT models do not recognize the "scan 
code" value generated by pressing the ALT key to bring up the 
main menu in DESQview 1.02 and 1.10. (The situation is the same 
in Quarterdeck's 1.0 and 1.20 versions). This BIOS change has 
also affected other PC software such as ProKey, Framework and 
SuperKey. 


THE SOLUTION:  DESQVIEW 1.03 AND DESQVIEW 1.11

There are two new versions of DESQview:

         o  DESQview 1.03          SixPakPlus, Advantage!

         o  DESQview 1.11          SixPakPremium, RAMpage, RAMpage AT
             (requires 
              AST EEMS product)

These new DESQview versions are identical to the previous 
versions (1.02 and 1.10 respectively) except for the following:

     - They run correctly on BOTH old and new XTs and ATs
     
     - They include a Self-Running Demo of DESQview on the 
       disk.  Simply type "DV" before DESQview is actually
       installed on the PC system. After installation, "DV" 
       runs the program, not the demo. 
 
     - With AST EEMS cards, version 1.11 of DESQview provides
       faster, more reliable performance with FlashPak than
       is possible with DESQview 1.10. (FlashPak buyers who have 
       RAMpage or RAMpage AT will get a coupon in their FlashPak
       manual for a free DESQview upgrade from Customer Service, 
       as well as an upgrade for an updated version of AST's REMM        
       software [also required] to be included on SuperPak 6.1 in 
       June).
 

UPGRADE PROCEDURE FOR BUYERS OF NEW XT'S AND AT'S

Anyone who purchases a new IBM PC-XT or PC-AT who has also 
purchased an AST product containing DESQview 1.02 or DESQview 
1.10, is entitled to receive a compatible version of DESQview, 
free of charge from AST. Here's the procedure:


END USER UPGRADE

1. The end user must send in the following:

         o  Title Page to his DESQview manual. 
           
            This has the DESQview version number on the front and 
            Table of Contents on the back. (This is NOT the manual
            Cover Page).

         o  His Name and Address.

2. This should be mailed to:

                    AST Research          
                    Customer Service
                    2121 Alton Ave.
                    Irvine, CA  92714-4992

                    Attn: DESQview Upgrade



HOW TO MODIFY 1.02 AND 1.10 TO RUN ON NEW MACHINES

It is not difficult to modify DESQview 1.02 and 1.10 to run on 
the new XT and AT. The user simply needs to boot the DESQview 
program on an OLD PC or AT and create a "script" (macro) to 
reassign the ALT key to another keystroke, such as the grey "+" 
key. He should do this in a DOS window under DESQview, which he 
will save as the file "D1-SCRIPT.DVS". Then all he has to do is 
make copies of the file, one named DESQVIEW.DVS and another for 
each of the programs he'll be using under DESQview -  
"LT-SCRIPT.DVS" for Lotus, "D2-SCRIPT.DVS" for dBASEII, and so 
on. These should all be stored in the DESQview subdirectory
(\DV) and he's ready to go.
