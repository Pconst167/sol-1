                 AST-3780/SERIAL LASER PRINTERS


The  following  information  and instructions in  this  technical 
bulletin  applies  only if you are receiving data directly  to  a     
serial laser printer (such as the Hewlett Packard 2686A).

When  receiving a print file from the host to a  serial  printer, 
the  first  line of data of every new page may be shifted to  the 
right by the number of spaces equal to the length of the previous 
record.   This  shifting  to the right is caused by part  of  the 
default  set-up for the serial laser printers;  at the end  of  a 
page,  the default set-up is sending a form feed with no carriage 
return.  There are two solutions to this problem:

1.  Receive the data directly to the disk first,  then  copy  the  
    file to the  printer using  the DOS  command: 
        
                   copy filename.extension lpt1:

2.  Consult  the  printer's  manual for  the  correct  method  of 
    setting   up  the  printer  to  generate  a  carriage  return 
    automatically each time a form feed is executed.
