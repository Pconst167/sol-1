               COLOSSUS INSTALLATION ON AT&T 6300


PROBLEM:   If  the  customer  formats  his  COLOSSUS  DISK  SYSTEM            
           using the AT&T MS-DOS Ver 3.X, he will experience "Disk 
           ACCESS FAILURES."


           NOTE:  AT&T MS-DOS Ver. 3.X formats the hard disk using 
           12  bit  Fats as opposed to IBM's PC-DOS 16  bit  Fats.  
           The  Colossus  System is not designed to  operate  with 
           this type format.   Once formatted,  the later versions 
           of DOS can utilize earlier formats.


SOLUTION:  TO OPERATE THE COLOSSUS SYSTEM ON THE AT&T  6300;  THE 
           CUSTOMER MUST FORMAT EACH COLOSSUS VOLUME  USING  AT&T 
           MS-DOS 2.X BEFORE USING THE COLOSSUS SYSTEM.
