       HARDWARE INTERRUPT ASSIGNMENT IN THE IBM PC AND XT


When interfacing products to the IBM PC or XT, which use hardware 
interrupts,  it is necessary to insure their is not conflict with 
other devices in the system utilizing the same interrupt.

The  following  table  shows the hardware  interrupts  and  their 
assignments.
