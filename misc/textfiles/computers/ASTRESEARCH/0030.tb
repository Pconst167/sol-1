           DMA CHANNEL ASSIGNMENT IN THE IBM PC AND XT


When  interfacing products to the IBM PC or XT,  which use Direct 
Memory Access (DMA),  it is necessary to insure that there is not 
a conflict with a device using the same channel.

The following table shows the channels and their assignments.
