    EAGLE SPIRIT PC COMPATIBILITY WITH AST 5251/11 EMULATION


The  EAGLE  SPIRIT  personal computer has been found  not  to  be 
compatible  with the AST-5251/11 emulation.   According to  Eagle 
Computer Inc., the reason for the incompatibility is due to their 
hardware design of the EAGLE SPIRIT computer's BUS.      

The  BUS  pin  number A1 (I/O channel check),  required  for  our 
emulation,  is  not present on their machine.   The  I/O  channel 
check,  however,  is  present on the IBM personal computer's  BUS 
design, and is utilized by the AST-5251/11 emulation.
