              DESQVIEW / MICROSOFT WORD VERSION 3.0


It  has  been reported that there is an  incompatibility  between 
Microsoft's "WORD", Version 3.0, with DESQview.

When  attempting  to open a Microsoft "WORD" window in  DESQview, 
the  customer's printer begins to print unmeaningful  characters.  
This  soon stops and the program seems to  run  correctly.   When 
attempting to save data files created by "WORD" in DESQview,  the 
data files are corrupted.

What is required for DESQview to run properly with "WORD" v3.0 is 
a loader program.  This can be obtained by contacting Quarterdeck 
at:

                   Santa Monica, CA 90405

This  fix  is  for Version 3.0,  and does not  affect  any  other 
versions of "WORD",  or any of Microsoft's other programs.   This 
will cover all versions of DESQview.
