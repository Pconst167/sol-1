                 SUPERPAK AND MICROSOFT WINDOWS                 
               

Tests  have been conducted with MicroSoft Windows,  Version 1.01, 
and with RAMpage/SuperPak combination.  The tests have determined 
that  a  conflict  exists when using Windows  Version  1.01  with 
SuperPak Version 5.02.  This conflict is a "REMM" software issue, 
not a hardware or EEMS problem.

The  common symptoms are erroneous or an incomplete  display,  or 
system hang-ups.  

Future release of SuperPak,  scheduled for end of February  1986, 
will resolve this issue.
