                   MGO 123/PREVU AND MAX 12E

Our customer base has reported that the Princeton Graphic MAX 12E 
monitor  does not function properly with the AST MonoGraphPlus or 
Preview!

The symptom reported is that when high intensity is selected, the 
monitor displays reverse video with no characters legible.   This 
symptom was reported using the display test in IBM diagnostics or 
when using Turbo Pascal.

According   to  Princeton   Graphic,   Technical   Support,   the 
incompatibility  exists with AST as well as other  manufacturers.  
The  short-term solution,  according to Princeton Graphic,  is to 
remove D201.  D201 is located on the main board next to the input 
signal  connector  in the MAX 12E.   Princeton  Graphic  did  not 
indicate  what  their  long-term solution is  but  serial  number 
ky23501 through kw15861 will not have D201 installed.

AST   recommends   that  Princeton  Graphic  be   contacted   for 
confirmation and instructions of modification.
