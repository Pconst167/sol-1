                     CODEVIEW/PREMIUM 286


Some customers have reported a problem with Codeview v1.0 from
Microsoft.  Switching video pages changes the display to a
bright yellow, becoming unreadable.  Also, the system will
lockup when in CGA.

The problem can be corrected by an upgrade to Codeview v1.1.
The customer should contact Microsoft for this upgrade.
