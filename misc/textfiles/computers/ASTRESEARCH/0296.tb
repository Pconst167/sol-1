                  HOTSHOT 286 AND REX.SYS 1.0


The Hotshot 286 does not work with the version of REX.SYS that
was on Superpak 5.02+1.10.  Using version 1.0 of REX.SYS causes
the system to lock up after REX.SYS is executed in the
CONFIG.SYS.

Replacing REX.SYS version 1.0 with version 1.11, corrects the
problem.

REX.SYS version 1.1 is available on SuperPak 6.0 and above.
