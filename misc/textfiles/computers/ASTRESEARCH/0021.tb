      USING A TALLGRASS HARDFILE AS THE PC-NET FILE SERVER


A Tallgrass HardFile running with Tallgrass software release 4.18
or   later  is fully compatible with AST-PCnet and AST-PCnet  II. 
However,  for proper operation with the network,  please note the 
following.

     1.  The "Duplicate Directory", "Cache Memory",  "Verify Read
         After Write",  and "Landing Zone" options must be turned 
         off (disabled).

     2.  Any   time  you   change  the   "Duplicate   Directory", 
         "Allocation  Unit  Size  (AU)",   or  "Directory   Size" 
         parameters  in  TGSYS,  you  must  also  initialize  the 
         affected directory or directories on the HardFile.  This 
         is  done  with the "D" or "F" commands in the  Tallgrass 
         program   called  UTILITY.    Since   initializing   the 
         directory  will  cause you to lose all the data on  that 
         volume, these options should be used with great caution.

     3.  Whenever   you   change   the   "Duplicate   Directory", 
         "Allocation   Unit  Size  (AU)",   or  "Directory  Size" 
         parameters in TGSYS,  followed by the "D" or "F" options 
         in UTILITY,  you must run SPCINST followed by UPCINST on 
         all affected networked PCs.

     Failure  to observe these instructions may cause the uPCs to 
     be  unable to properly read the  Tallgrass  directory.   For 
     example, a "DIR" command from the uPC to the sPC's Tallgrass 
     drive  may show missing files,  extra files,  or no files at 
     all, while the same "DIR" command entered at the sPC returns 
     the  proper  directory  listing.   Another symptom  of  this 
     problem is when a "CHKDSK" command issued to a shared volume 
     returns  different  information on the uPC compared  to  the 
     same command issued at the sPC.
