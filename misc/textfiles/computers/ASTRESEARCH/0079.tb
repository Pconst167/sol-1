                 PROPER USE OF THE AST MP MINI


When  expanding the memory of the IBM PC or compatibles with  the 
AST MP Mini card, it is important to remember that no matter what 
PC  is  used,  there must be exactly 256KB of user RAM  installed 
below the AST MP Mini.   This is because the MP Mini has a  fixed 
starting address of 0040:0000 Hexadecimal.  The ending address is 
A000:0000  Hexadecimal.   This means that no other expansion card 
may address within the 256KB-640KB range of user RAM, even if the 
MP Mini is not fully loaded with 256KB and the optional Mini Pak.

To conclude,  the PC must have 256KB on the system board,  or the 
combination  of  the  system board and  another  expansion  card, 
before the MP Mini can be installed.  There must not be any other 
RAM resident in the PC between the 256KB and 640KB range.
