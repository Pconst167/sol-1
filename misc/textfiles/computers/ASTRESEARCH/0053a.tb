           CORRECTING THE TIME/DATE OF THE AST CLOCK*


SYMPTON:       It  appears the clock is set correctly because the 
               time and date remain correct while the machine  is 
               on.   However,  after  rebooting or turning  power 
               back  on  to your PC,  the time  and/or  date  are 
               incorrect.  This symptom may be an indication that 
               the ASTCLOCK has not been set.

EXPLANATION:   The ASTCLOCK is accessed only at power up or  upon 
               rebooting.  The time and date remain correct while 
               there  is  power  to the machine because  you  are 
               utilizing the system clock.

PROBLEM:       If  the  ASTCLOCK  utility is  executed  prior  to 
               running the SETCLOCK utility, it may be preventing 
               the correction of the time/date in the AST clock.

SOLUTION 1:    Temporarily remove the ASTCLOCK utility from  your 
               AUTOEXEC.BAT  file.   Reboot the machine.   Follow 
               the  procedure in your manual for setting the  AST 
               clock.   Restore  your  AUTOEXEC.BAT file  to  its 
               original configuration by inserting ASTCLOCK.

SOLUTION 2:    Interrupt   your   AUTOEXEC.BAT   file   prior  to 
               execution   of   ASTCLOCK  using   the   CONTROL-C 
               function.  Follow the procedure in your manual for 
               setting the AST clock.



*  Applies  only  to those products which  use  the  SETCLOCK.COM 
   utility.   Those  which use the ASTCLOCK.COM utility are reset 
   with  the  /R  parameter  as described  in  the  User  Manual.
