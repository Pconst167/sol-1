      HAYES SMARTCOMII/LAN-RSN-REACH! MODEM COMPATIBILITY  


Testing was done to determine the compatibility of Hayes SmartCom 
II/LAN software with the AST Research RSN card and REACH! modem.

Hayes SmartComII/LAN is a software package that allows the  modem 
on a network to be shared by the network users/workstations.  

When  the  modem  server  command is issued  at the  server,  the 
following message is displayed:
     
     MODEM  OR DIRECT-CONNECT DEVICE  ALREADY  REGISTERED.   
     THIS COMMAND WAS REDUNDANT.

Hayes Technical Support confirmed this to be a known bug.   Other 
than   this  error  message,   the  server  appears  to  function 
correctly.

Attempted  entry into SmartComII/LAN on the "user" PC causes  the 
following message to be displayed:

     SMARTMODEM NOT RESPONDING ON SMARTMODEM 1200.

Hayes Technical Support and AST Research Engineering both alluded 
that the SmartComII/LAN software is an evaluation copy containing 
several possible bugs.
          
Neither problem encountered was rectified and the testing  proved 
unsuccessful.

Further  testing will be conducted at a later date with  released 
software versions.
