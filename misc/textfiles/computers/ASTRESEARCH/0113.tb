                  PCNET (COAX) SELFTEST PROBLEM


The PCnet SELFTEST program will, under certain conditions, give a 
false  indication  of failure when operated with Release  3.0  or 
above.   Only a few boards have experienced this problem, and can 
be  attributed to a build-up of tolerances of components used  in 
the  construction  of  these  boards.   There  is  no  components 
associated  with any range of serial numbers,  so the problem may 
be experienced with new or old boards.

If  the  following  message  is  displayed  after  the  Interrput 
selection is made:

          Select Interrupt 2 (Default), 3, 4, or 5> (n)

          *Response to unexpected interrupt 0**
          *No response from selected interrupt (n) **

     1.  Stop test and reconnect the system cable or terminator
         plug to the BNC connector of the PCB.

     2.  Restart the test.

     3.  If test runs successfully, consider the board as having
         passed Selftest.

     4.  To insure correct Network operation, Nettest should also
         be run.

A  note should be entered into the PCnet Users Manual  under  the 
"SELFTEST" command description referencing the above information.
