             REACH MODEM/HAYES INCOMPATIBILITY

The AST Reach Modem differs from the Hayes modem in a number
of specific ways.  These include the inability to generate
the BREAK signal and error generation if hyphens are
included in phone numbers during dialing.  The Reach modem
is a discontinued product and no fixes or modifications will
be implemented.
