                    AST-PCOX TROUBLESHOOTING


The intent of this Technical Bulletin is to help the user of AST-
PCOX troubleshoot situations that may arise at installation time.  
It is assumed that the user has read all manuals supplied by  AST 
for  the  installation  procedure,   and  is  familiar  with  all 
terminology contained within.

PROBLEM
The user has been able to successfully log on to the host and can 
run  all  applications necessary.   When the user tried to  "boot 
load" the basic file transfer,  a message shows that the PC  must 
be logged onto the host before "boot load" can be performed.

SOLUTION
This  is  one  possible  situation where such  an occurrence  can 
happen.   If the 32xx controller and the host have the port, that 
the PC is assigned to, defined as a graphics terminal, such as an 
S3G,  then the Professional Workstation Facility will not be able 
to function.  AST-PCOX only supports 3278 or 3279 Model 2, 3, and 
4 in the "basic" configuration.  The key here is that through the 
logmode on the host,  the user can redefine themselves without  a 
host  reconfiguration.   The  user should contact  their  systems 
programmer  to  find  out how to use this feature because  it  is 
different for every host.  The following is an example used on an 
IBM 4341 host running VTAM and CMS Release 3.

i.e., LOGON APPID,LOGMODE = M32782S
      This example allows this user to logon to CMS as a 3278 
      Model 2, even though the host has him initially defined
      as a 3279 Model S3G.
