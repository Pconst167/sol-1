              MONOGRAPH COMPATIBILITY WITH MS WORD    


Located  in position U38 of the MonoGraph card is a  programmable 
CRT controller device.   The CRT controller generates the signals 
necessary  to  interface  a digital system to a raster  scan  CRT 
display.

MICROSOFT  Corporation  currently  has a  word  processor  called 
"WORD".   Due to the parameters utilized to program the registers 
of  the CRT controller,  this particular program (WORD)  requires 
that an enhanced version of the CRT controller be  present.   The 
symptom  of  not having an enhanced version of this chip is  that 
the display goes into a vertical roll.

Listed  below  are  CRT controller devices that  will  allow  the 
"WORD" to operate properly.
