           INCOMPATIBILITY OF COLUMBIA'S PARALLEL PORT


Due  to  compatibility  inquiries,  tests have been conducted  on 
Columbia's (DESKTOP PC model 1600) parallel port.

The  results  of these tests show that Columbia parallel port  is 
not  directly  compatible  with  IBM  hardware  standard  or  AST 
SuperSpool.

Listed  below are three major considerations to be aware of  when 
configuring this system with an AST product.

     1.   Parallel port on Columbia does a self increment.   When 
          an  AST  product with a parallel port is installed  and 
          addressed   as  LPT1,   the  Columbia   parallel   port 
          increments to LPT2.

     2.   SuperSpool  will  not function properly when output  is 
          directed  to  Columbia's parallel port.   This is  true 
          whether the port is addressed as LPT1 or LPT2.

     3.   Located  on  the Columbia's motherboard  is  the  cable 
          connector for a parallel port.   This connection is not 
          IBM  plug compatible.   It is a 37 position  connector, 
          whereas the IBM and AST parallel port connectors are 25 
          position.

To optimize usage  of an AST product in this PC;   1) address AST 
board as LPT1,  thereby allowing usage of SuperSpool,  2) procure 
an  IBM compatible cable or modify existing cable to conform with 
IBM standards,   3) if Columbia's parallel port is to be used, do 
not direct SuperSpool to this point.


Note:  All testing and considerations are based on PC-DOS.
