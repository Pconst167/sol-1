            USING DISPLAY CARDS WITH AST5251/11



There is a limitation in using monochrome display cards with
the AST5251/11 emulation board.  If you are defining reverse
image fields and underlining as input, some monochrome
display cards do not support these features.  If you use the
AST5250 display card with the 5251/11 card, these attribute
limitations will no longer exist.
