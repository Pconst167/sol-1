                  AST 5251/11 PRINTER PROBLEM


When using a Corona Laser printer configured as a 5256-1 and
defined as Epson LPT1 with an ITT XTRA (XT compatible) computer
connected to a S/34, emulation runs properly.  However, when
attempting to print, the S/34 will respond with a message "To
Press Start Button on printer to start printing".

The printer will print correctly under DOS.
