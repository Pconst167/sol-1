      CONFIGURING AST COMMUNICATION AND LAN NETWORK BOARDS 
          THAT USE IRQ2 WITH THE LEADING EDGE MODEL D

                                                
The  LEADING  EDGE Model D comes defaulted at IRQ2 for their  TOD 
CLOCK.   Therefore,  you  must  change  the AST board  if  it  is 
defaulted at IRQ2 to an unused IRQ, or change the system board of 
the LEADING EDGE computer to another IRQ selection.

Instructions  in  LEADING  EDGE  Guide  to  Operations   provides 
information on changing the IRQ on the system board.
