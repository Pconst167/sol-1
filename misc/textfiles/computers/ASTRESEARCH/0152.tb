        AST-5251/11 WITH AT&T 6300 USING DISPLAYWRITE 36


When  configuring  an AST 5251/11 board in an AT&T 6300  or  6300 
PLUS, it is suggested to configure the workstation on the host as 
a 5251/11,  not a 5291 or 5292.  Configuring the workstation as a 
5291  or 5292,  can cause the terminal to lock up when attempting 
to create, revise, or view a DISPLAYWRITE 36 document.
