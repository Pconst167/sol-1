                    MP-MINI MEMORY ADDRESSING


It has been determined that there is potential for the MP-Mini to 
cause memory errors under certain conditions.

These   problems   could  occur  when  using  the  256K   MP-Mini 
configuration (without the Mini-Pak). 

The  MP-Mini has no hardware method of determining  where  memory 
addressing  should  stop if the MP-Mini is not  fully  configured 
with  384K  of RAM.  The board is meant to start at an address of 
256K  and end at 640K.   If any software application attempts  to 
establish  the amount of memory available with only 256K  of  Ram 
on  the  MP-Mini installed,  a "parity check two" error could  be 
generated, locking the machine up.

One program where this occurs is with Norton Utilities' "SYSINFO" 
program.  This program checks to see what equipment is  installed 
in the PC. When it attempts to check memory size with a 256K  MP-
Mini installed  a "parity check two" error is generated.
