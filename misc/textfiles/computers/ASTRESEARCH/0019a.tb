                       IBM PC ERROR CODES


Below  is  a list of error codes that may occur during  the  POST 
(Power On Self Test) or when running the IBM Diagnostics.   If it 
were to occur during the POST, it would appear as a three or four 
digit number.  If it were to occur during the IBM Diagnostics, it 
would  appear  as "ERROR -- SYSTEM UNIT xxyy",  where xx  is  the 
device  number and yy is the error code.   The most common  error 
code is 01.   For example, the error message "ERROR - SYSTEM UNIT 
201"  would appear in the IBM Diagnostics if it were to detect  a 
memory error.
