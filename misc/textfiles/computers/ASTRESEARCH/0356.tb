                   PREMIUM/286/WORDSTAR 2000


Using the word processing package "Wordstar 2000: Release 2" on
AST's Premium/286 will result in the error "PRINTER NOT READY"
when outputting data from the Premium/286's Parallel Port to a
Hewlett Packard Laserjet II.

Micropro is aware of this condition.  It is scheduled to be
resolved in "Release 3" of Wordstar 2000.
