           SUPERSPOOL AND THE 3270 PC CONTROL PROGRAM


When  using SuperSpool in the 3270PC,  while the  3270PC  Control 
Program  is resident,  it is not recommended that Version 1.20 of 
SuperSpool  be used.  Tests conducted by AST have  revealed  that 
using  this  version causes the 3270 PC to "lock-up"  or  "hang".  
The  reason  for  this is because  this  version,  when  invoked, 
determines  the  memory configuration of the  system,  before  it 
evaluates  the  parameters specified at the command  line.   When 
doing  this it overwrites and destroys the Control Program  above 
DOS (High Memory).

It is our recommendation that Version 1.30 of SuperSpool be  used 
with  the  3270PC Control Program.   This  verison,  unlike  1.20 
evaluates the parameters specified at the command line first.  It 
then  determines  which memory it should use,  and then  reserves 
that memory from DOS.

Testing was done using DOS 2.10,  2.00,  and level 1.10 of  IBM's 
3270PC Control Program.

Note:   Version  1.30 of SuperSpool is presently part of SuperPak 
4.1.
