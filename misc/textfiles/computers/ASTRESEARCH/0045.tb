        PATCHING WORDSTAR FOR PRINTING TO ALTERNATE PORTS


WORDSTAR   can  be  configured  for  either  serial  or  parallel 
printing,  yet it makes no provision for specifying which  serial 
or parallel port to be used. It defaults to COM1:, and LPT1:.

The patches provided below are for WORDSTAR Version 3.3, and allow 
one to use COM2:, or LPT2: or LPT3: for printer output.

Patching for COM2: use;

     Install  WS.COM as you would for COM1:,  with the  necessary 
     parameters for your printer.   Then at the DOS prompt, enter 
     DEBUG as shown and enter the the following commands.

          DEBUG WS.COM             <Return>
          E 081E 01                <Return>
          E 0833 01                <Return>
          W                        <Return>
          Q                        <Return>

     WORDSTAR is then patched for COM2: use.

Patching for LPT2:, or LPT3: use;

     Install  WS.COM as you would for parallel printing.   At the 
     DOS prompt,  enter DEBUG as shown and enter the commands  as 
     shown.

     For LPT2:, type;

          DEBUG WS.COM             <Return>          
          E 07D0 01                <Return>
          E 07E6 01                <Return>
          W                        <Return>
          Q                        <Return>

     WORDSTAR is then patched for LPT2: use.

Patching for LPT2:, or LPT3: use;

     For LPT3:, type;

          DEBUG WS.COM             <Return>
          E 07D0 02                <Return>
          E 07E6 02                <Return>
          W                        <Return>
          Q                        <Return>

     WORDSTAR is now patched for LPT3: use.
