                       SUPERSPOOL AND LPT2


To  use  SUPERSPOOL in conjunction with a second parallel  device 
(LPT2) follow this procedure:

     1)  Initially  set SUPERSPOOL up at LPT1 at which  time  all 
         parameters should be installed.

     2)  Next,  move  SUPERSPOOL to LPT2 by  typing  in  SUPERSPL 
         LPT2:.

     3)  Now  redirect  printer  output to  LPT2.   This  may  be 
         accomplished  by  running LPTSWAP.BAT (refer  to  User's 
         Manual appendix "Switching Between LPT1 and LPT2").

     4)  Finally,  move  SUPERSPOOL  back to LPT1  by  typing  in 
         SUPERSPL LPT1:.  Printer output will now spool out LPT2.

         Note:  Install parameters only in the initial set up.
                Make sure SUPERSPOOL is initially set up at LPT1.

                When  you are ready to use LPT1 again repeat  the 
                above process.
