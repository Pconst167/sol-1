                        CLEO'S 3780 PLUS


The purpose of this Technical Bulletin is to clarify the  product 
named 3780 Plus.   A company named Cleo Software manufactures the 
3780 Plus.   Some Cleo Software 3780 Plus packages include an AST 
CC-432 communications board.   However,  other Cleo 3780 packages 
are   shipped   with  non-AST  hardware.    Cleo  Software   also 
manufactures SNA and BSC packages that may or may not include AST 
hardware.   If the package includes AST hardware,  the board will 
be labeled with AST's logo and "CC432". 

Cleo's  3780  Plus  software  has  only  three  combinations   of 
interrupts and I/O addresses.  The default is I/O address 300-30F 
and  interrupt 2.   The two other choices are I/O address 320-32F 
and interrupt 3, and I/O address 340-34F and interrupt 4.  If you 
must change the interrupt,  you must also change the I/O address.  
Conversely,  if  you must change the I/O address,  you must  also 
change the interrupt.   For example,  if you wanted to change the 
interrupt to 3,  you would also need to change the I/O address to 
320.   Consult  section two of the AST CC-432 Users  Manual  part 
number 000140-001 C.

If you have other questions, call Cleo Software at (815) 397-8110.
