                   EPSON EQUITY II / PREVIEW!



Upon  initial power up (cold boot) the Preview!  produces missing
and  blinking characters as well as dashes throughout the  entire
display.   Pressing  Ctl-Alt-Del  keys  (warm  boot)  clears  the
symptom and the Preview! then functions properly.
