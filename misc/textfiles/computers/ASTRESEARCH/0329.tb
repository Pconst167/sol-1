                     CROSSTALK/PREMIUM 286


Some Crosstalk users have reported to AST Customer Support that
the program may run erratically on the Premium 286 computer.
The problem only occurs while operating the Premium 286 in the
10 MHz mode.

The solution for this problem is to use Crosstalk version 3.61
which was tested and works at all three operating modes.
