                 MONOGRAPHPLUS CAUTION STATEMENT


The  following  caution statement is included both as a  separate 
warning  notice,  and  as a notice within both  manuals  in  each 
MonoGraphPlus shipping package.

                       C A U T I O N ! ! ! 

     TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO YOUR MONITOR, DO NOT RUN THE IBM
     DIAGNOSTICS  WITH  YOUR  AST  RESEARCH  MONOGRAPHPLUS 
     BOARD  UNTIL YOU HAVE MODIFIED THEM ACCORDING TO  THE 
     INSTRUCTIONS  IN  APPENDIX  A  OF  THE  MONOGRAPHPLUS 
     USER'S  MANUAL  OR APPENDIX E  OF  THE  MONOGRAPHPLUS 
     TECHNICAL REFERENCE MANUAL.

     If you run unmodified diagnostics with the MonoGraph
     Plus  board,  the  screen will display "garbage"  and 
     damage  to  your  monitor  can  result.    Under   no 
     circumstances will AST Research,  Inc.,  be liable in 
     any   way   for  damages  that  arise  from   running 
     unmodified  IBM  diagnostics  with the  MonoGraphPlus 
     board.

     Do not run the diagnostics if you are unable to patch 
     them. 

The  damage  which  is  referred to is that  a  fuse  within  the 
Monochrome monitor may "blow" and result in the requirement for a 
service  call.   As this is an internal fuse, the monitor must be 
opened  up to service the fault.   We do not  recommend that  the 
customer  attempt  this  service  himself.    Potentially  lethal 
voltages  exist  within the monitor,  even with  the  power  cord 
removed from the source.  In addition, this fuse is soldered into 
the circuit,  and as such,  soldering skills are required for its 
replacement.
