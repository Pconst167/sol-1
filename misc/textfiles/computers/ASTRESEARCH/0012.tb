               MEGAPLUS II IRQ SILKSCREEN CONFLICT


In  certain revisions of the MegaPlus II,  the silkscreen for the 
IRQ block is in error.  The correct silkscreen for the IRQ jumper 
block should be:

                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
                                              < JUMPER BLOCK
                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
      CORRECT
                    2  2  3  3  4  4  5  5  7

                    S  C  S        C  C  S  C

The incorrect silkscreen is as follows:

                    *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *
                                              < JUMPER BLOCK
