                    TESTING OF THE GAME PORT


Depending on the version and type of IBM Diagnostics used to test 
AST multifunction boards, the game port is not always recognized.  
If the game port option is not recognized,  or you're not able to 
add  it to the IBM Diagnostics Table,  an alternative  method  of 
testing is listed below.

     This program requires the use of BASICA.COM


     10 DEFINT A-Z  :  KEY OFF  :  CLS  :  STRIG ON  :  SCREEN 2
     20 PRINT "X1","Y1","S1";"S3"
     30 X1 = STICK(0)  :  Y1  =  STICK(1)
     40 A  =  STRIG(0)  :  C  =  STRIG(5)
     50 LOCATE 3  :  PRINT X1,Y1,A;C
     60 GOTO 30


When  running  the above program,  moving the joystick in the  X-
plane (left-right) causes a change in the "X1" readout  displayed 
on  monitor,  while  moving the joystick in the Y-plane  (updown) 
causes a change in the "Y1" readout.  Pressing the switch (either 
one  or two,  depending on your joystick) causes a change in  the 
"S1" or "S3" readouts from 0 to -1.   Note that, depending on the 
quality  of  your joystick,  you may not be able to  get  a  zero 
reading in the X and Y planes when running the program.
