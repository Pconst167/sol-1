                   RAMPAGE/AT SWITCH SETTINGS


Figure  2-2  of the Rampage/AT Manual,  part number  000305-001A, 
lists  the  default  switch  settings.   The  figure  incorrectly 
depicts  SW1-9 as OFF.   This switch should be  ON.   The  switch 
enables the dual page mode used by DESQview.    Also,  the manual 
has  no information on SW1-10.   This switch is unused and should 
be left on.
