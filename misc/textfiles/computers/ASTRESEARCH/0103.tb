                  REACH!/SMARTCOM COMPATIBILITY


It  has been found through testing that Hayes Smartcom II version 
2.1 will not work with AST's REACH! modem product.

The problem stems from the fact that Smartcom now has a different 
way  of recognizing return product codes and does  not  recognize 
the REACH! modem as being installed.

There are no plans to make the two products compatible.
