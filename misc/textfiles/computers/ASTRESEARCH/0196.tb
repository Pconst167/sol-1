                      DESQVIEW/LOTUS/E.G.A.         


Some  DESQview  users have reported to AST Customer Support  that 
they  are  experiencing difficulties when using Lotus  Release  2   
or  Symphony  Version 1.1 in conjunction with the IBM EGA  or  an 
equivalent product.

They  have  found that these programs will not  display  properly 
inside a DESQview window. These programs may "spread" outside the 
window boarders.

To  prevent this from happening,  Quarterdeck has suggested  that 
the  user   run  the  "Install"  program  (for  either  LOTUS  or 
SYMPHONY)  and change the "text" driver set from "EGA"  to  "CGA" 
mode.
