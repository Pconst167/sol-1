AST RESEARCH TECHNICAL BULLETIN TB-0184                   5-25-86


                   CC-432 AND ALLOY HARD DISKS


The  purpose  of  this  technical bulletin  is  to  assist  users 
configuring   systems   that   contain  both   the   AST   CC-432 
communications  card and an Alloy hard  disk  controller.   Alloy 
hard  disks use interrupt 2 and I/O address 300.   Since this  is 
the  default  interrupt and I/O address of the AST  CC-432  card, 
either  the  CC-432 card or the Alloy card must be  reconfigured.  
If you do change the interrupt and I/O address on the CC-432, AST 
recommends  using I/O address 340-34f or  360-36f.   I/O  address 
320-32f conflicts with Alloy controller cards.

This  information does apply to Alloy's Quicstor hard  disk.   If 
you  are using the Quicstor with a network or emulation  product, 
some  Alloy  dealers recommend using the PIO mode to  format  the 
hard  disk.   Consult  the  Quicstor manual or  call  your  Alloy 
distributor for more information on the PIO mode.
