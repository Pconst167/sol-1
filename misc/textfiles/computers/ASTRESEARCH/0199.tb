                   REACH! MODEM/LINE PROBLEMS


There have been reports from Reach! modem users of a problem that 
occurs during communications with another system.

While receiving data at 1200 baud,  the character "}" is inserted 
intermittently  throughout the data.  It does not seem to  matter 
which communications program is being used at the time. Also, the 
problem does not occur when communicating at 300 baud.

It  has  been  found that this condition is due  to  noise  being 
generated  on the telephone lines.  The "}" character is what the 
communications program is translating the received noise into.
