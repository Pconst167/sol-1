			AUDIO BOOST ON THE AMIGA 500
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This hardware hack is not advanced and gives you a much higher volume out
of your Amiga (With good quality!)

First remove the screws (This will destroy your warrenty!) from the Amiga
shell (even the screws for the drive!) now carefully open your Amiga,
There are some pigs holding the shell at it's place so don't break those!
(as i have!)   Now remove the screws from the metallic shield and gently
remove the keyboard cable! (Remember the direction the connector are!)
now remove the drive! (Yet another time remember how it was connected!)
now find the filter (LF347) near this circuit you find the condensators
at 22uF (you will actually find two!) the condensators are named C334 and
C324 and two resitors named R334 and R324 now take a dual switch and connect
it like this:

		SWITCH:

    +------------1  4------+
    |                      |
    | +----------2  5----+ |
    | |                  | |
    | |          3  6    | |
    | |                  | |
    | |                  | |
    | + +C334            | + +C324
    +--  R334            |
			 + R324

And now you can boost more sound of ya Amiga, but be carefull you can destroy
your speekers if ya pump up the volume too much!
(The level meter on my gettoblaster goes to max if i turn on my boost)

I must say that if your Amiga brakes down cause of this little hardware hack
then don't blame me!

And if you are not good at soldering then let someone else do it! (even if
the soldering on this hack is really easy!) and DON'T USE A HIGH WATTAGE
SOLDER IRON! (MAX 25 WATT)
