  
     Currently the XGA exists only in Microchannel versions.

     All register accesses happen through a block of 16 registers starting
     at a adapter dependant register (called xga in the following).
     The register xga+0Ah works as an indexed register ie. xga+0Ah is the
     index register and xga+0Bh is the data register.




     xga+0:  Operating Mode
       bit 0  Set if VGA, clear if dual monitor.
           2  Set if in an extended mode.

              Each read or write of the register will increment the
              palette address, first through the Red, Green Blue

  Video Modes:
   
    640x480   256 colors
    640x480 65536 colors
    800x600    16 colors
    800x600   256 colors
    800x600 65536 colors  
   1024x768    16 colors
   1024x768   256 colors
    
   
   All modes use a linear address mode, where bits 16-23 of the address 
   are in the Video Aperture Index register (xga+8), and the lower 16 bits 
   are the offset from 0A000:0.

   In 16 color modes two pixels are stored in each byte. Even pixels are in
   bits 0-3 and odd pixels in bits 4-7.
   Address of pixel = (row *(pixels per row)+coloumn) /2.

   In 256 color modes each pixel occupies a byte. The pixels are addressed
   in linear fashion. Address of pixel = row *(pixels per row) + coloumn.

   In 65536 color modes each pixel occupies two bytes.
   Address of pixel = (row *(pixels per row)+coloumn)*2.
