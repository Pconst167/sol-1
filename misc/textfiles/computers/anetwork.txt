
        This program is an attempt to try to make a very simple
ST to ST link. The main objective was to make it as transparent as
possible to the user and to other programs. 


                LOADING AND SETUP

        ANET uses three user vectors starting at $200 and the drivemap
located at $4C2. A reset using the reset buttom sometimes does not
clear the lower system memory so if this program is resident you must
use a cold start "power off and power on" or a reboot program for it to
be reloaded correctly when you run the ANETWORK.PRG or ANETCTRL.PRG after
the reboot. The ANETCTRL.PRG has a reboot selection on the MENU.

    Double-click on the ANETWORK.PRG to load the resident program then
double-click on the ANETCTRL.PRG to load the control program. After the
first load you can usually load both the resident and control programs by
running ANETCTRL.PRG after a reboot.
 
     ONLY LOAD THE ANETWORK.PRG IF YOU GET A MODULA-2 ERROR 
TRYING TO RUN ANETCTRL.PRG FIRST. AS IT WILL LOAD THE ANETWORK.PRG FOR YOU.

        The control program lets you set the baud rate, reboot the ST,
reset the network message sequence count, turn the network on and off,
see which ICONS to install to use the remote disks and of course to quit
the control program. The NEW command on the sequence MENU is to resync
the remote program if it gets out of sync due to a reboot, hang or and
error condition. Click the mouse on NEW to send a resync command to the
remote and try to access the ICON again.
        MAKE INT on the mode MENU will make a network setup file called
ANETWORK.INT that ANETWORK.PRG reads to set the baud rate and to turn
the netork on or off. ANETCTRL.PRG also reads the INT file when it is
loaded and uses the parameters to set up the menu values. Clicking the 
pointer on MAKE INT will save the current menu values on the ANETCTRL.PRG 
menu to a new ANETWORK.INT file.

        To load the dial menu make a file called ANETWORK.DIL. It can
have up to 16 entrys for phone numbers. Each entry must be terminated with
a RETURN. If you have a HAYES modem enter the dial code, the number, a
space, then the name of the service or person.

Example:   
ATDT696-0060 genie
ATDT691-7862 CIS
 


                USE

        Install the ICONS on the GEM DESKTOP for the remote system drive(s)
you wish to access, then just use them just like any other disk drive. Due
to the slower serial access it is usally better to copy the file a local
disk if you wish to edit or run the file. Every effort has been made to
make sure it is error free but I would only use it to read from the remote
rather that sending files due to a crash may cause disk file links to be
lost while creating new files on the remote system.


        You need a crossover cable for the ST to ST connection.
                          like this.
local                                                 remote
                2------------\  /-------------3
                              \/ 
                              /\
                3------------/  \-------------2

                7-----------------------------7



                <-------- any length --------->

It is possible to use a modem using a std cable from the ST to modem.
