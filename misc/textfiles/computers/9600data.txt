                              A High Speed Modem
                              ==================

Are you thinking of going to a High speed modem?

2400 baud can be very slow for transferring large files.
Modems advertised as 4800 are really only 2400 with data compression such
as MNP-5 or even just software data compression. Don't be fooled.
A 9600 or faster modem will make a tremendous difference on your transfer time.
Most 9600 Baud users never want to go back to 2400. There is a lot of confusion
and mis-information about 9600 Baud and faster Modems. I wrote this to help
clarify and point out the differences between the different modems available
for MS-DOS machines.

If price is no object, the Best modem to get for BBS use is the US Robotics
Dual Standard. It is a combination of the HST 14400 Baud modem and a
V.32/V.42 modem all rolled into one modem.

If price is an Issue, (like it is to most people) then you may want to consider
a Standard HST 14.4k, or a different Brand if that is also too expensive.
But if you do not buy a US Robotics Modem, you will not be able to hook up to
a Standard USR HST 14.4k, which is the most Common BBS Modem.

Other then USR, you could get a V.32 or V.32/V.42 computable modem for about 
25% less then a Standard HST, or you could get a 9600 FAX/Modem for less then
half the cost of a V.32  See the price comparisons at the end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  STANDARDS
				  =========


At one Time Hayes was the standard in modems. All other modems tried to be 
"Hayes Compatible". This is still true with 1200 and 2400 bps modems,
but NOT when it comes to 9600 or faster modems. Hayes established a Standard
called the AT command set. Other modem manufacturers quickly adopted this
standard and the AT commands are still used today (with a few commands added).

Well Along Came USRobotics, and designed the HST, a proprietary 9600 modem
that quickly became popular, and no one else was allowed to duplicate. 
Hayes then also came out with a proprietary 9600 modem, but since it could not
talk to the HST at 9600 it never became popular in the IBM world.
Next USR improved their HST modem, making it transfer at 14400 bps without
even using data compression. 
USR's HST became the standard for MS-DOS computable High Speed modems.

Realizing that the industry needed a "non-proprietary" 9600 standard that
any manufacturer could use, the CCITT came up with the V.32 specification.
It took a several years before modem manufactures started finding ways to
implement this standard at a price competitive to HST, but a few manufactures
started producing them, including Hayes. Next the CCITT realized that better
error correction and data compression methods existed, and thus came up with
the V.42 and .V42 bis standard. They are currently finalizing the V.32bis
specification, which will also run at 14,000 Baud in full duplex.

Now Modem Manufactures all seem to be jumping on the V.32 Bandwagon,
Even USR offers V.32/V.42 modems and allows the HAT's to be upgraded to
a "Dual-Standard" so it can be both HST and V.32/V.42 in one.
The New Hats also have V.42bis and can be upgraded to the new V.32bis DS.
The price Difference between the HST and the HST-DS is considerable though,
which is why Most BBS Sysops still buy the HST without the "DS" option.
The V.32/V.42 have become the standard in the Macintosh world, and some
MS-DOS BBS's are now running V.32/V.42 instead of supporting the HST,
and some are supporting both types, using multiple lines.

Fax Machines have had their own standards, CCITT V.27, V.27ter, and V.29
define the modulation scheme used for Fax, and T.30 defines a Fax Protocol. 
Fax Machines nowadays can transfer Faxes at 4800 or 9600 Baud. Most Fax/Modems
can only transfer files at 2400 Baud. There is now one Fax/Modem which can
also transfer files at 9600 bps, and is far less expensive then the V.32/V.42s,
plus offer the benefits of a Fax machine. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               The CCITT
        		       =========	

The International Consultive Committee for Telegraph and Telephone (CCITT)
set the V.32, V.42, and V.42bis Standards in 9600 bps communications.
They have also set the standards of 1200 and 2400 bps in Europe.
Unfortunately the V.32 standard is very expensive to implement for the
modem manufactures, and the HST has already become the industry standard
in the IBM BBS world. But since any company may manufacture V.32/42 Modems
without a license or royalty, there is more price-competition going on
with these then with the HST, which currently has no true competition. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 			Half Duplex Vs. Full Duplex
                        ===========================

Half-Duplex is When Data is Transited in one Direction at a time.
Full-Duplex is both directions at once. 2400 baud modems are Full-Duplex.
The HST Modem uses an improved form of Half-Duplex, in which one direction is
transferring at high speed while the other direction is sending ACK/NAK signals
at a slower speed. A similar method is used on the Speedmodem.

V.32 modems use Full duplex, which in most cases does not improve performance
when used on a BBS. There is one way to take full advantage of a Full-Duplex
Modem: By using a protocol called Bimodem to upload and Download as the same
time at 9600 bps in each direction! Unfortunately Bimodem has not become very
popular. Most BBS's and users still use one direction transfer protocols such
as Zmodem or YModem-G.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        What is MNP, HST, V.32, V.42?
                        =============================

                                     MNP
					
MNP (Microcomm Network Protocol) levels 1-4 are methods of error correction
in which the two modems connected verify the integrity of the data transmitted.
Error correction is required for several streaming protocols such as Ymodem-G
in which the protocol sends a constant stream of data and lets the modems do
the error correction. This requires a clean, noise free line as streaming
protocols will abort if line noise interferes too much.
These MNP Levels are used in almost all High Speed Modems Made today, But
Just because two modems both have MNP it does not ensure that they will both
talk to each other (at over 2400 baud).

MNP Level 5 is for data compression. Since All BBS's have their files archived
in ZIP, LZH, GIF or some such compressed format (try to ZIP a LZH file), MNP5
can actually increase the overhead by attempting to compress the file further.
Therefore BBS's leave MNP5 turned off, and so should the BBS callers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  HST

HST stands for "High Speed Technology" - a method of communicating at high
speeds which was developed by US Robotics in 1984. HST is a proprietary
method so currently only US Robotics is allowed to Make HST Compatible Modems.
The original HST modems were 9600 bps by using a 9200 bps channel in one
direction and a 450 bps "back channel" in the other to send ACK/NAK
signals for confirmation of data - a half duplex mode - often referred to
as "ping-ponging". In 1989 USR improved the HST to run at 14400 bps by further
optimizing their proprietary method. All HST's sold now include the 144k
speed as well as the original 9600 mode. Because the HST 14.4k is a raw speed,
It allows the HST to transfer pre compressed files such as ZIPs at faster
speeds then any other 9600 modem: over 1700 Characters per second.

The HST has become the "BBS-Standard" in high-Speed Modems. More BBS's use
the HST then any other type of modem, including the V.32. 

As of January 1st 1991 all HST modems also include the V.42/V.42bis error
correction and data compression (not to be confused with V.32).

The HST's can also be upgraded to the HST "Dual Standard" allowing it to also
be V.32bis compatible. The price is significant for this upgrade however,
and in very few cases is any speed gained.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   V.32 

V.32 is a 9600 Baud standard that was established by the CCITT back in 1984.  
V.32 is full duplex (9600 bps in both directions at once). Normally this would
be impossible, but using a technique called "echo cancellation", one modem
can filter its own tones from the phone line, enabling it to pick out the
signals from the other modem. However, echo cancellation requires that high
speed modems include built-in digital signal processor (DSP) chips, which is
the main reason V.32 and V.42 costs so much. 
V.32 also includes a fall back to 4800, if line noise becomes a problem at 9600.
The V.32 standard also provides an optional error-reduction scheme, called
"trellis-coded modulation (TCM). TCM allows 9600 modems to check for
transmission errors with a redundancy bit, which results in fewer errors on
noisy lines. Most V.32's include this option, but some do not.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 V.32bis

It was first realized in 1989 that it is feasible to push V.32 up to 14,400
baud, the same speed as the HST now runs. This requires even better echo
cancelers and an overall improvement in receiver quality, so it will be 
more costly to produce than the V.32 to produce. V.32bis has not yet officially been
finalized CCITT, but as of January 1st US Robotics has started shipping
a new version of their Dual Standard Modem which includes V.32bis in an early
but functional form. USR plans to update their DS ROMS when the CCITT actually
release the completed V.32bis specification, scheduled for mid 1991.
It's expected that other Modem manufacturers will not be able to offer the
V.32bis technology until the 4th quarter of 1991.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   V.42

V.42 is nothing to do with actual modem speed, but how the error correction
and data compression schemes interface. When the CCITT approved V.42 in 1988,
they decided to include two different error correction and data compression
schemes. The first one is MNP,(short for Microcom Networking Protocol).
MNP classes 2, 3, & 4 which handle error correction. Note that MNP-5 was not
included in the V.42 standard because it is only used for data compression.
MNP was made an official standard due to the large number of modems that
currently use it. The Second method is the preferred method, known as LAP-M
(Link Access Protocol-Modem). A modem with only MNP is called "V.42 Compatible"
and one with LAP-M its known as "V.42 Compliant". If a V.42 Compliant connected
to a V.42 compatible, it would first try to Handshake with LAP-M, and after it
realized that the other modem is not Compliant, it would try the MNP Method, and
they connect.

Most V.42 modems are fully V.32 compatible, but they do NOT have to be,
according to CCITT guidelines. So when purchasing a V.42, make sure that
it is really a V.32 Modem that is also V.42 compliant or compatible.
There are now some 2400 baud modems which are also V.42bis compliant,
so since the LAP-M gives 4:1 data compression they are advertised as
"9600 throughput", which really can be misleading and confusing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 V.42bis

V.42bis is a new CCITT standard for data compression techniques, which was
approved in late 1989. To Support V.42bis, a modem MUST support both LAP-M and
MNP-5, unlike the Standard V.42 in which LAP-M is only an option. V.42 provides
a maximum data compression of 4:1, giving a 9600 bps modem a throughput up to
38400 bps. MNP only offers 2:1 Compression. Like MNP-5, LAP-M and V.42bis will
not be effective when transferring compressed files from BBS's, such as ZIP
files. Since V.42 is implemented in firmware, many V.42 compliant modems can
be upgraded to V.42bis with a new ROM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                               Speedmodem

A less expensive method of 9600 bps communication can be achieved without
using the CCITTs method of "echo cancellation", so that the a digital signal
processor is not needed, making the cost much less expensive.
This method is used on the Compucom Speedmodem. The Speedmodem also uses
Dynamic Impedance Stabilization (DIS) to increase the reliability of the
telephone interfaces signal-to-noise ratio of the telephone line by increasing
the clarity and power of the signal, and automatically compensating for
impedance variations on the phone line. This reduces the probability of
line noise, allowing the Protocols to transfer files with less overhead
It also has a faster fall back rate of 7200 bps if too much line noise exists
for 9600 communications. This makes the Speedmodem stand up to worse line
noise conditions at a faster rate then V.32 can handle.
The Speedmodem is also a 9600 bps Group III Facsimile, so with this modem,
you can send document and scanned images as a Fax, as well as receive Faxes.
It supports BitFAX by Bitcom and any other 3rd party FAX software which 
uses the standard CCITT AT-FAX command set.
A Data Compression called CSP (CompuCom Speed Protocol) is used to yield a
compression of up to 4:1, giving a throughput of up to 38400 bps.
This however, like MNP5 will not be effective when transferring compressed
files from BBS's, such as ZIP files.

DIS and CPS are proprietary methods owned by CompuCom, Sunnyvale, CA.
Because this modem is inexpensive more people can afford to buy it, and since
its both a FAX and a Modem in one, it should gain popularity quickly. 
It is still a new product, but hundreds of BBS's are showing support for it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               What Next?

By mid 1991 the V.32bis standard will be finalized, and by that years end
the several 14,400 Bps full duplex modems will be on the market.
There is already talk of the CCITT releasing another standard in 1992,
which will be for 192,000 bps. Since these modems are expected to cost
considerably more then the V.32s currently on the market, they will be
out of the price range of most BBS users.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


                           WHAT TO LOOK FOR

THROUGHPUT:
==========

You'll see ads claiming that you can attain 19,200 bps or 38,400 bps
with a 9600 Baud modem - this is true only if you are using MNP5 or other
form of data compression on an uncompressed data or text file. Any 9600 Baud
modem using compression will transfer at that effective rate. 
But for BBS use, where files are already compressed (such as ZIPs, LZHs, GIFs)
MNP5 will actually slow down throughput by attempting to compress a file that
is already compressed. Generally when using a modem for BBS transfers, its
the RAW speed of the Modem and not the throughput which is important.

Figures of around 1700 cps by the HST modems are attained through proprietary
methods not available on other modems.


CONFIGURABILITY:
================
In High Speed Modems, there is a lot more to configure than on a 2400 Baud
modem. Be sure your modem comes with NRAM (Non-volatile Random Access Memory)
that can store your modem configuration, making long init strings unnecessary.
Also many modems have dip switches to set the default configuration, which
also simply things. If you buy an Internal Modem, be sure its fully
Configurable as far as selecting the com port and IRQ (interrupt request)
setting. Some modems can be addressed from Com1: up to COM8:


UARTS
=====
Internal Modems have a serial port built in, and External Modems use an
existing Serial Port in the computer. A serial port has a UART chip to buffer
and control the Input/Output (I/O). The XT usually has an 8450 UART which will
handle up to 9600 Baud. The AT usually has the 16450. If you have an external
modem you should replace your UART with the 16550 (NS16550AN).


INTERNAL or EXTERNAL
====================
MS-DOS Users can choose internal modems, that plug in a computers slot,
or external, which plugs into an existing serial port with a serial cable.
Internals are usually less expensive, take up less space, have the correct UART
already installed (see below) and don't need a cable. But the Externals usually
have a lot of little lights on it that you can stare at, and its easier to move
to another machine. So which ever you prefer (or is available in some cases). 



If Considering a USRobotics Modem
=================================
You only need to worry about weather you want the HST
(which can be upgraded later), or the Dual Standard
which is the same modem with the V.32bis option included.


If Considering a V.32/V.42 Modem
========================================
Some questions to ask:

Can you afford the USR "DS" instead?
Is it both V.32 and V.42 compatible?
Is it V.42 compatible, V.42 compliant, or V.42bis?
If its not V.42bis or compliant, can it be upgraded?
Do Local/National BBS's support it?
Would you rather wait a year for a V.32bis?
What is the warranty? 5 years?


If Considering a FAX/Modem
==============================
some questions to ask:

Is it Send and Receive Fax?
Does it support 3rd party FAX software?
Is it 4800 or 9600 bps?
Does it support MNP?
Does it support other compression?
Do Local/National BBS's support it?
What is the Warranty? 5 Years?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


                    Modem Compatibility Listing:
                    ============================


These modems will usually be downwardly compatible with 2400 Baud and slower
modems, Which means they are also CCITTY V.22bis and Bell 103/212A compatible.
Most have an auto-fall back mode that will detect the highest negotiable Baud
rate, which can either through hardware or software configuration. 
If the modem is V.42 capable, it will fall back to MNP if the other modem is
not LAP-M  capable, but is MNP capable. Modems supporting MNP will connect
with data compression/error correction with other MNP modems at the highest
Baud rate negotiable between the two. The speeds listed here are the actual
Raw speed, not possible throughput that can be achieved using data compression.

                          Price Comparisons
                          =================

No Prices have been stated above this Section, because prices often change,
and I want to keep all the prices together so they could be quickly updated
as needed. There are 3 types of prices I will cover. First is The Retail price,
second is the Sysop price, which is only available if you run a BBS.

Many Modem Manufactures offer BBS Sysop special prices directly, at about
50% off the retail price. First the BBS has to be verified, so the modem
manufacture knows that is a real BBS that has been running for at least
6 Months, and has a minimum number of users, etc. Usually the Manufacturer
will call the BBS once, or twice a few week apart to be sure. Verification
usually take 3-4 weeks. Then the Sysop has to agree to use the Modem on the
BBS for some set amount of time.

01/19/91   1.2c	      Ran the spelling checker through this unbelievable
                      document.  Some of the spelling is still wrong like
                      "weather" for "whether."  (T. Rosen)
