Edit a 4dos.ini file if you don't have one.
It should look something like this:

Alias = 4096
Environment = 1264
History = 4096

set alias and environment as low as possible, but remember to leave
space for bat files and programs that use the space. A environment
of 100 more that required is good. It is good to set the alias space
as low as possible. Set the history as high as you prefer. I like 4k,
others might like more...

UMBLoad = Yes
UMBEnvironment = Yes
UMBHistory = Yes
UMBAlias = Yes

If you have umb's, specify these 4 lines!

DescriptionMax=200

ALWAYS insert this line! Now you can describe up to 200 characters, which
is more than enough in most cases. The default of 40(?) is almost never
enough...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need file-descriptions that is MORE that 200 characters, remove
the attributes on the DESCRIPT.ION file (attrib -h descript.ion)
edit it, and turn the attributes back on (attrib +h descript.ion)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>HistWinHeight=32

If you drive your screen at text resolutions of 50 lines or more, have
the luxury of a bigger history window! (PgUp, PgDn, etc.)

The prompt leaves you many fancy options other that $p$g.....
Mine, help from 4dos and ansi.sys, shows time, date, free memory
(conv, xms, ems), free hd space (all drives), in full colours...

You can find it in the extras\prompt.set, which you will have to load
with SET /R [name of file]. Modify it as you like, bacause it is free to
spread!

With 4dos, you have the luxury of specifying to "md" or "cd" several
directories at once. You can, for instance, md a b c d e f, in which
will make the directories "a" "b", etc....

You can even create a total tree with the "/s" parameter.
This will allow you to create directories more than one level deep at once.

fx: md c:\hi\I\am\here!

will work, even if "c:\hi" does not exist in forehand!

In 4dos, the command-line separator is "^".
That means that you can write several commands on one line, fx.

cls^dir /w /s|list /s^pause^cls

This method can in turn create neat aliases, and if you need examples,
look at MY aliases file! (Included in EXTRAS\aliases.ali        !!!!

Be sure to remap your most used commands in dos to 1-key punches,
to maximize performance. See my alias-file for guidance.
Ex: "d" is "dir", etc....
