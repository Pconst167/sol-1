                         SECRET CONCENTRATION CAMPS
 
       The September issue of THE OSTRICH reprinted a story from the
   CBA BULLETIN which listed the following principal civilian concentra-
   tion camps established in GULAG USA under the =Rex '84= program:
   Ft. Chaffee, Arkansas; Ft. Drum, New York; Ft. Indian Gap, Penn-
   sylvania; Camp A. P. Hill, Virginia; Oakdale, California; Eglin
   Air Force Base, Florida; Vendenberg AFB, California; Ft. Mc Coy,
   Wisconsin; Ft. Benning, Georgia; Ft. Huachuca, Arizona; Camp
   Krome, Florida.  The February OSTRICH printed a map of the expanding
   Gulag.  Alhough this listing and map stirred considerable interest,
   the report was not new.  For at least 20 years, knowledgeable Patriots
   have been warning of these sinister plots to incarcerate dissidents
   opposing plans of the =Elitist Syndicate= for a totalitarian
   =New World Order=.  Indeed, the plot was recognized with the insidious
   encroachment of "regionalism" back in the 1960's.  As early as 1968,
   the "greatest land steal in history" leading to global corporate
   socialism, was in a ="Master Land Plan"= for the United States
   by =Executive Orders= involving water resource regions, 
   population movement and control, pollution control, zoning
   and land use, navigation and environmental bills, etc.  Indeed,
   the real undercover aim of the so-called "Environmental Rennaissance"
   has been the abolition of private property.
       All prelude to the total grab of the =World Conservation Bank=,
   as THE OSTRICH has been reporting.  The map on this page and
   the list of executive orders available for imposition of an "emergency"
   are from 1970s files of the late Gen. =P. A. Del Valle's= ALERT,

     A Dangerous Fact Not Generally Known
     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
     THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE ARTICLE
     4 SECTION 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES.  "THE
     UNITED STATES SHALL GUARANTEE TO EVERY STATE IN THIS UNION A
     REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT, AND SHALL PROTECT EACH OF THEM
     AGAINST INVASION; AND ON APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE, OR OF THE
     EXECUTIVE (WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CANNOT BE CONVENED) AGAINST
     DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."  "REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT A REPRESENTATIVE
     REPUBLICAN FORM OF GOVERNMENT!"

     When Government gets out of hand and can no longer be controlled
     by the people, short of violent overthrow as in 1776, there are
     two sources of power which are used by the dictatorial government
     to keep the people in line:  the Police Power and the Power of the
     Purse (through which the necessities of life can be withheld).
     And both of these powers are no longer balanced between the three
     Federal Branches, and between the Federal and the State and
     local Governments.  These powers have been taken over, with the
     permission of the Federal Legislature and the State Governments,
     by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and all attempts
     to reclaim that lost power have been defeated.

     Stated simply:  the dictatorial power of the Executive rests primarily
     on three basis:  Executive Order 11490, Executive Order 11647, and
     the Planning, Programming, Budgeting System which is operated
     through the new and all-powerful Office of Management and
     Budget.

 E. O. 11490 is a compilation of some 23 previous Executive Orders,
     signed by Nixon on Oct. 28, 1969, and outlining emergency functions
     which are to be performed by some 28 Executive Departments and
     Agencies whenever the President of the United States declares
     a national emergency (as in defiance of an impeachment edict,
     for example).  Under the terms of E. O. 11490, the President
     can declare that a national emergency exists and the Executive
     Branch can:
     * Take over all communications media
     * Seize all sources of power
     * Take charge of all food resources
     * Control all highways and seaports
     * Seize all railroads, inland waterways, airports, storage facilities
     * Commandeer all civilians to work under federal supervision
     * Control all activities relating to health, education, and welfare
     * Shift any segment of the population from one locality to another
     * Take over farms, ranches, timberized properties
     * Regulate the amount of your own money you may withdraw from
       your bank, or savings and loan institution

     All of these and many more items are listed in 32 pages incorporating
     nearly 200,000 words, providing and absolute bureaucratic
     dictatorship whenever the President gives the word.

-->  Executive Order 11647 provides the regional and local mechanisms
-->  and manpower for carrying out the provisions of E. O. 11490.
-->  Signed by Richard Nixon on Feb. 10, 1972, this Order sets up Ten 
-->  Federal Regional Councils to govern Ten Federal Regions made up
-->  of the fifty still existing States of the Union.

     is provided over every community.

     Then, controlling the bedgeting and the programming at every
     level is that politico-economic system known as PPBS.

     The President need not wait for some emergency such as an impeachment
     ouster.  He can declare a National Emergency at any time, and freeze
     everything, just as he has already frozen wages and prices.  And
     the Congress, and the States, are powerless to prevent such an
     Executive Dictatorship, unless Congress moves to revoke these
     extraordinary powers before the Chief Executive moves to invoke
     them.

     THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE THE INTENT AND
     PURPOSE OF ARTICLE 4 SECTION 3.  THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THIS 
     SECTION OR THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES FOR FORMING A
     REGIONAL STATE OUT OF A GROUP OF STATES!  FURTHER, THESE EXECUTIVE
     ORDERS GROSSLY AND FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE THE 9TH AND 10TH
     AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION!

     By Proclaiming and Putting Into Effect Executive Order No. 11490,
     the President would put the United States under TOTAL MARTIAL LAW
     AND MILITARY DICTATORSHIP!  The Guns Of The American People Would
     Be Forcibly Taken!

          A war, even the most victorious, is a national misfortune.
                             --Helmuth Von Moltke, Prussian field marshall

       George Bush put the United States on the road to its second war in
    two years by declaring a national emergency on August 2,1990.  In
    response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Bush issued two Executive
    Orders (12722 and 12723) which restricted trade and travel with Iraq
    and froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets within the U.S. and those in the
    possession of U.S. persons abroad.  At least 15 other executive orders
    followed these initial restrictions and enabled the President to
    mobilize the country's human and productive resources for war.  Under
    the national emergency, Bush was able unilaterally to break his 1991
    budget agreement with Congress which had frozen defense spending, to
    entrench further the U.S. economy in the mire of the military-
    industrial complex, to override environmental protection regulations,
    and to make free enterprise and civil liberties conditional upon an
    executive determination of national security interests.

    The State of Emergency
       In time of war a president's power derives from both constitutional
    and statutory sources.  Under Article II, Section 2 of the
    Constitution, he is Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces.  Although
    Congress alone retains the right to declare war, this power has become
    increasingly meaningless in the face of a succession of unilateral
    decisions by the executive to mount invasions.
       The president's statutory authority, granted by Congress and
    expanded by it under the 1988 National Emergencies Act (50 USC sec.
    1601), confers special powers in time of war or national emergency.
    He can invoke those special powers simply by declaring a national
    emergency.  First, however, he must specify the legal provisions under
    which he proposes that he, or other officers, will act.  Congress may
    end a national emergency by enacting a joint resolution.  Once invoked
    by the president, emergency powers are directed by the National
    Security Council and administered, where appropriate, under the
    general umbrella of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).[1]
    There is no requirement that Congress be consulted before an emergency
    is declared or findings signed.  The only restriction on Bush is that
    he must inform Congress in a "timely" fashion--he being the sole
    arbiter of timeliness.
       Ultimately, the president's perception of the severity of a
    particular threat to national security and the integrity of his
    appointed officers determine the nature of any state of emergency.
    For this reason, those who were aware of the modern development of
    presidential emergency powers were apprehensive about the domestic
    ramifications of any national emergency declared by George Bush.  In
    light of Bush's record (see "Bush Chips Away at Constitution" Box
    below) and present performance, their fears appear well-founded.

    The War at Home
       It is too early to know all of the emergency powers, executive
    orders and findings issued under classified National Security
    Directives[2] implemented by Bush in the name of the Gulf War.  In
    addition to the emergency powers necessary to the direct mobilization
    of active and reserve armed forces of the United States, there are
    some 120 additional emergency powers that can be used in a national
    emergency or state of war (declared or undeclared by Congress).  The
    "Federal Register" records some 15 Executive Orders (EO) signed by
    Bush from August 2,1990 to February 14,1991.  (See "Bush's Executive
    Orders" box, below)
       It may take many years before most of the executive findings and
    use of powers come to light, if indeed they ever do.  But evidence is
    emerging that at least some of Bush's emergency powers were activated
    in secret.  Although only five of the 15 EOs that were published were
    directed at non-military personnel, the costs directly attributable to
    the exercise of the authorities conferred by the declaration of
    national emergency from August 2, 1990 to February 1, 1991 for non-
    military activities are estimated at approximately $1.3 billion.
    According to a February 11, 1991 letter from Bush to congressional
    leaders reporting on the "National Emergency With Respect to Iraq,"
    these costs represent wage and salary costs for the Departments of
    Treasury, State, Agriculture, and Transportation, U.S. Customs,
    Federal Reserve Board, and the National Security Council.[3]
       The fact that $1.3 billion was spent in non-military salaries alone
    in this six month period suggests an unusual amount of government
    resources utilized to direct the national emergency state.  In
    contrast, government salaries for one year of the state of emergency
    with Iran[4] cost only $430,000.

     |        George Bush, perhaps more than any other individual in    |
     |   U.S. history, has expanded the emergency powers of             |
     |   presidency.  In 1976, as Director of Central Intelligence,     |
     |   he convened Team B, a group of rabidly anti-communist          |
     |   intellectuals and former government officials to reevaluate    |
     |   CIA inhouse intelligence estimates on Soviet military          |
     |   strength.  The resulting report recommended draconian civil    |
     |   defense measures which led to President Ford's Executive       |
     |   Order 11921 authorizing plans to establish government          |
     |   control of the means of production, distribution, energy       |
     |   sources, wages and salaries, credit and the flow of money      |
     |   in U.S. financial institutions in a national emergency.[1]     |
     |        As Vice President, Bush headed the Task Force on          |
     |   Combatting Terrorism, that recommended:  extended and          |
     |   flexible emergency presidential powers to combat terrorism;    |
     |   restrictions on congressional oversight in counter-            |
     |   terrorist planning;  and curbing press coverage of             |
     |   terrorist incidents.[2]  The report gave rise to the Anti-     |
     |   Terrorism Act of 1986, that granted the President clear-cut    |
     |   authority to respond to terrorism with all appropriate         |
     |   means including deadly force.  It authorized the               |
     |   Immigration and Naturalization Service to control and          |
     |   remove not only alien terrorists but potential terrorist       |
     |   aliens and those "who are likely to be supportive of           |
     |   terrorist activity within the U.S."[3]  The bill superceded    |
     |   the War Powers Act by imposing no time limit on the            |
     |   President's use of force in a terrorist situation, and         |
     |   lifted the requirement that the President consult Congress     |
     |   before sanctioning deadly force.                               |
     |        From 1982 to 1988, Bush led the Defense Mobilization      |
     |   Planning Systems Agency (DMPSA), a secret government           |
     |   organization, and spent more than $3 billion upgrading         |
     |   command, control, and communications in FEMA's continuity      |
     |   of government infrastructures.  Continuity of Government       |
     |   (COG) was ostensibly created to assure government              |
     |   functioning during war, especially nuclear war.  The Agency    |
     |   was so secret that even many members of the Pentagon were      |
     |   unaware of its existence and most of its work was done         |
     |   without congressional oversight.                               |
     |        Project 908, as the DMPSA was sometimes called, was       |
     |   similar to its parent agency FEMA in that it came under        |
     |   investigation for mismanagement and contract                   |
     |   irregularities.[4]  During this same period, FEMA had been     |
     |   fraught with scandals including emergency planning with a      |
     |   distinctly anti-constitutional flavor.  The agency would       |
     |   have sidestepped Congress and other federal agencies and       |
     |   put the President and FEMA directly in charge of the U.S.      |
     |   planning for martial rule.  Under this state, the executive    |
     |   would take upon itself powers far beyond those necessary to    |
     |   address national emergency contingencies.[5]                   |
     |        Bush's "anything goes" anti-drug strategy, announced      |
     |   on September 6, 1989, suggested that executive emergency       |
     |   powers be used:  to oust those suspected of associating        |
     |   with drug users or sellers from public and private housing;    |
     |   to mobilize the National Guard and U.S. military to fight      |
     |   drugs in the continental U.S.;  to confiscate private          |
     |   property belonging to drug users, and to incarcerate first     |
     |   time offenders in work camps.[6]                               |
     |        The record of Bush's fast and loose approach to           |
     |   constitutionally guaranteed civil rights is a history of       |
     |   the erosion of liberty and the consolidation of an imperial    |
     |   executive.                                                     |
