The following is the fourth posting of the Alternate History List. As it
appears that there were difficulties in the distribution of version 3, this
version is being posted sooner than it might have been and is only about
5% longer than the previous version. The only major change appearing in this
version is elimination of the Alien Intervention category due to submitters'
requests. The stories in that category have been shifted elsewhere.
 
As before, the number of stories not yet categorized remains over 100 and your
help would be appreciated in placing them. If you can help, please try to
make your submissions in a format similar to that used. Please be sure to
mention what you think is the appropriate category, and why.
 
Afficionados of the genre might like to note the recent publication of William
Sanders' THE WILD BLUE AND THE GRAY. Additionally, McSherry's recent anthology
THE FANTASTIC CIVIL WAR contains a few AH stories, including the novella-
length version of Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee".
 
Enjoy...

                          THE ALTERNATE HISTORY LIST
                           Version 4 - 16 July 1991
 
This is a list of (nominally) SF stories involving Alternate Histories, also
known as What If? stories, Allohistory and Counterfactuals. Most of the
information comes from the many submitters (listed at the end of this posting)
and the poster's own memory, but a great deal has been cribbed from:
 
Hacker, Barton C., and Gordon B. Chamberlain, "Pasts that Might Have Been, II:
 A Revised Bibliography of Alternative History", in ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES (ed.
 Waugh and Greenberg)
 
In order to keep the length of the list down, only English-language stories
have been included. Even so, the list is incomplete. Your suggestions for
additional entries would be appreciated, as would corrections, amendments,
etc., to current entries. Please send submissions directly by e-mail to
schmunk@spacsun.rice.edu in order to guarantee consideration, as follow-up
postings to r.a.s may not be noticed. This list will be re-posted whenever
enough changes and/or additions have been made to make it worthwhile.
 
Despite blurring of boundaries, an attempt has been made to separate stories
into the following categories:
 
Alternate Histories: Story essentially limited to one alternate history. Some
 multiple timeline stories are included as long as crosstime travel/
 communication is not involved.
Future Glimpses: Character is given a glimpse of how history might unfold
 depending on his/her actions/decisions. The future seen is not the history
 we know.
Crosstime Stories: Story involves more than one potential history, with
 sideways time travel often the major feature. Such stories may also include
 "vertical" time travel and "different" worlds.
Changing the Past: Story involves someone changing the course of history,
 either accidentally or deliberately, often after time travel into the past.
 Time travel stories in which history is *not* changed are excluded.
World is "Different": Alternate world/history has different physical laws from
 ours, a common theme being "magic works". The alternate world must still
 be recognizably "Earth".
 
If you disagree with the category into which a story has been placed, please
do not hesitate to send me a message with an explanation of what its correct
category should be.
 
No attempt has been made to indicate which stories are "good" and which are
"poor". Sorry; perhaps in a future version.
 
In examining the entries, please note that:
 
1) A series of dashes in place of the author's name indicates that the story/
book is a sequel to or part of the same series as the story/book in the
preceding entry.
 
2) Short stories are generally followed by at least one reference to where they
may be found, though not necessarily to the first publication of the story.
References to book titles include the author/editor's name only if that person
is not the author of the short story.
 
3) Stories are listed under their most recent incarnations. A short story which
was revised before inclusion in a novel will be listed in the entry for the
novel (e.g., Turtledove's "Archetypes" is found under AGENT OF BYZANTIUM).
Stories not revised each have an individual entry, even if a number of them
were linked up to form a larger book (e.g., the four stories in Garrett's
MURDER AND MAGIC are listed separately).
 
4) Abbreviations frequently used in references are:
<AH> = ALTERNATIVE HISTORIES (eds. Waugh and Greenberg)
<Alt> = ALTERNATIVES (eds. Adams and Adams)
<BAW> = BOOK OF ALTERNATE WORLDS (ed. Adams)
<BT> = BEYOND TIME (ed. Ley)
<f&sf> = The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction
<HV> = HITLER VICTORIOUS (eds. Benford and Greenberg)
<IAsfm> = Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine
<IIHHO> = IF IT HAD HAPPENED OTHERWISE (ed. Squire)
<##AWBSF) = THE 19## ANNUAL WORLD'S BEST SF (ed. Wollheim and Saha)
<WMHB#> = WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN? VOL. # (eds. Benford and Greenberg)
<YBSF#> = THE YEAR'S BEST SCIENCE FICTION, #TH ANNUAL COLLECTION (ed. Dozois)
 
5) In story descriptions, times are all Anno Domini (AD; also known as CE,
Christian Era or Common Era) unless otherwise specified.
