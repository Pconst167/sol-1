                      THE GEORGE BUSH CONNECTION

In this day and age when some people can not even name the president
of the United States, it is not the least bit surprising that most
have no knowledge of George Bush's possible connections to the Kennedy
assassination.  The relationship has its roots in Bush's "former"
employment with the CIA.  As CIA agents have been quoted in the past,
you never really leave the Agency.

                            THE CIA DID IT!

Many researchers place the blame for the murder of John F. Kennedy on
the CIA.  The easiest way to clear the mafia or other non-governmental
groups is to look at the massive cover-up that the government has
participated in over the years.  If mafia boss Carlos Marcello had
really ordered the hit, could he have had the CIA and FBI suppress so
much evidence from the public for so long?  Could he have had the
normal security lowered for the assassination?  Could he have had the
Washington D.C. phone system knocked out of order for an hour right
as the shooting took place?  Could he have convinced the Warren
Commission to release such an idiotic official version of the murder?
Of course not.  The set-up and cover-up had to take place INSIDE of
the government, not outside.

The CIA seemed to have the most (and best) motives for the elimination
of Kennedy.  During the Eisenhower presidency, the CIA came up with a
plan to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs.  The thought was that the
citizens would hear of the attack and join in to overthrow Castro.
Former Cubans were trained by the CIA and the U.S. government fur-
nished them with weapons and transportation.  Since it was near the
end of his administration, Eisenhower put the plan on hold so the
new president would not have to deal with any problems which might
arise from the mission.

Upon entering office Kennedy decided that the plan's requirement of 16
planes would obviously reveal American backing of the plot.  The plan
had hoped that American involvement would not become known to the
world.  The use of 16 planes would make American backing obvious to
everyone.  Kennedy cut the number of planes down to six.  As the date
of the invasion neared, Kennedy decided against the plan and announced
in the press that the United States would not invade Cuba with the
military.

The CIA went ahead with the plan and quickly found that things were
not going as they had hoped for.  They asked for more planes but were
told they would have to be held back until the forces captured a Cuban
airport.  Then, the planes could be sent and the explanation would be
that they were captured planes which the rebels had put into use.  The
CIA-backed rebels never got that far and were quickly defeated.  The
citizens of Cuba never joined them in the fight.  The CIA, as has been
revealed in books by participants, blamed Kennedy for the defeat.  The
books and papers reveal a deep hatred for the imagined betrayal.

Later, Kennedy formed a panel to keep him informed as to what was
going on in Vietnam.  American involvement was still low at this
point but Kennedy was worried.  He has been quoted as saying he could
not justify sending American boys half-way around the world to fight
communism when it existed just south of Florida in Cuba.  One of the
panel's members was Allen Dulles, head of the CIA.  Kennedy caught
him in various lies and fired him.  The fact that the CIA had kept
training Cubans for another invasion until Kennedy finally sent in
FBI agents to break up their camps and confiscate their weapons was
another reason for the dismissal.  Other high-ranking CIA officials
were fired, too, including the brother of Dallas' mayor.  Kennedy 
changed the operating procedure of the CIA so they would have to get 
approval for any future covert actions from Robert Kennedy.

Due to persistent problems with the CIA and their continual involve-
ment in matters which were not their concern, Kennedy declared that
he was going to shatter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter
them to the winds.  Even former president Truman, who had created
the CIA, expressed concerns about their behavior.  Kennedy was
apparently going to leave their destruction until after the next
election but did start withdrawing troops from Vietnam, much to the
dislike of the CIA.  One of Johnson's first moves after he replaced
Kennedy as president was to increase American involvement in Vietnam.
It seems he owned an airline company that was contracted to fly troops
back and forth across the Pacific Ocean, but that is another matter.

Later, E. Howard Hunt, on behalf of the CIA, faked cables to implicate
John F. Kennedy in the assassination of South Vietnam's president, Ngo
Dinh Diem.  So, it is apparent that the CIA disliked Kennedy and had
the means to set-up and cover-up the assassination.  Now, it is known
that they convinced the Warren Commission that the Soviet Union and
Cuba had murdered Kennedy.  They scared the members into believing
that revealing this to the American public would result in a nuclear
war in which millions would be killed.  To further this theory, they
produced fake evidence showing that Oswald had visited the Soviet and
Cuban embassies in Mexico to arrange the killing and escape.  The head
of the CIA operations in Mexico has since admitted that no such real
evidence ever existed.  A Warren Commission investigator has admitted
that they acted to save millions by sacrificing one man (Oswald).

The job was not too hard to pull off since former CIA-head Allen
Dulles was a member of the Commission.  He was the only one to attend
more than half of the hearings and was also in charge of deciding
what intelligence data was seen by the other members.  President
Johnson didn't seem to find it strange to appoint the man that
Kennedy had fired to investigate his hated former boss' murder.

                       SO HOW DOES BUSH FIT IT?

Although he denies it, there is a growing body of evidence that George
Bush was working for the CIA as early as 1961.  Many feel he was
actually recruited during his college days (which is when he joined
the Skull and Bones Society, a front for the Illuminati).  Bush claims
to have been working for his own oil company during the early 1960's.
It would make for a convenient front since he claims to have been off-
shore on drilling rigs for weeks at a time.  The rigs were located all
over the world.  Was he really on the rigs or was he running around on
CIA business?  The various biographies of Bush are all sketchy on this
phase of his life.

During this time, Bush had moved to HOUSTON, Texas.  His wife was,
of course, BARBARA.  His oil company was ZAPATA Off Shore Co. (which
he named after a communist Mexican revolutionary who would invade
towns and murder every man, woman and child.  Bush also named an
earlier oil company after Zapata, a questionable choice for a hero).
The code name for the Bay of Pigs invasion was Operation ZAPATA!
A former high-ranking Pentagon official, Col. Fletcher Prouty, was
the man who secured two Navy ships for the operation.  He has told
of seeing the two ships repainted to non-Navy colors for the
invasion.  The ships were given the new names HOUSTON and BARBARA!

Of course, maybe the names were just coincidences, but Bush was
living in Houston with Barbara and running Zapata in 1961 during
the planning of the invasion.  The name "Operation Zapata" was top
secret and known only to a very few.

In 1977 and 1978, the government released nearly 100,000 pages of
documents on the Kennedy assassination.  One which slipped out by
mistake was from the FBI to the State Department written a few days
after the assassination.  The State Department was worried that anti-
Castro groups in Miami might stage another invasion of Cuba in the
aftermath of the JFK murder.  The FBI informed them that they had
questioned both pro-Castro and anti-Castro groups and could find no
information about such plans.  The memo went on to state that the
information was passed along to "George Bush of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency" the day after the assassination.

Why was the information passed along to the CIA?  Probably because of
their previous invasion attempt and other planned attacks.  Why George
Bush?  Probably because he was involved in previous invasion plans!

When the document first surfaced no one paid much attention to it.
When the presidential campaigns began for the 1980 election then the
name George Bush caught researchers' eyes.  When asked about the
memo, Bush denied working for the CIA at the time.  As evidence built
that it was indeed him, the CIA claimed it was a different George Bush
although their policy had always been to neither confirm nor deny a
person's employment.  The other George Bush was tracked down by
reporters and said that although he did work for the CIA at the time,
he was never involved in that sort of work.  The interesting point
is that the CIA did not bother to contact the other George Bush and
inform him that reporters might soon be calling.  Other evidence
surfaced that showed the George Bush mentioned in the document was
actually George H. W. Bush and had the same address as the famous
George Bush.

Another Bush connection involved George de Mohrenschildt, a rich
Russian oil man who lived in Texas when Lee Harvey Oswald settled
there after his trip to the Soviet Union.  De Mohrenschildt was a
long-time CIA agent and quite possibly served as a CIA control officer
for Oswald.  The Warren Commission described him and his wife as being
the two people friendliest to Oswald at the time of the assassination.
De Mohrenschildt's son-in-law told the Warren Commission that if any-
one had helped with the assassination it was most likely de Mohren-
schildt.  De Mohrenschildt was also the man who moved Oswald to
Dallas.

Shortly before the House Select Committee on Assassinations started
meeting in the late 1970's a new doctor appeared in de Mohrenschildt's
town.  De Mohrenschildt started seeing him and quickly became mentally
unstable.  His wife convinced him to stop seeing the doctor.  The
doctor then moved away and left a false forwarding address.  The very
day the Committee tried to contact de Mohrenschildt about testifying,
he was found dead of a gun shot wound.  His personal address book was
found and it contained the entry "Bush, George H. W. (Poppy) 1412 W.
Ohio also Zapata Petroleum Midland."  Bush's full name is George
Herbert Walker Bush which matches the initials given and his earlier
oil company was named Zapata Petroleum Corp.  Why was his name in de
Mohrenschildt's book?  Is "Poppy" his CIA code name?

It is known that in the early 1960's de Mohrenschildt made frequent
trips to Houston, which was the location of Bush's home.  He told
friends he was visiting the Brown brothers, who were close friends
and financial supporters of Lyndon Johnson.  CIA documents reveal
that during the planning phase of Operation Zapata, de Mohrenschildt
made frequent trips to Mexico and Panama and gave reports to the CIA.
His son-in-law told the Warren Commission that he believed de Mohren-
schildt was spying for the planned Cuban invasion.

                        A QUESTION OF CHARACTER

When Bush was picked to be director of the CIA in 1976, he testified
to Congress that he had never worked for the CIA before.  Of course,
it did not make much sense to appoint a director who had no such back-
ground but Congress approved him anyway.  Now it would seem that Bush
committed perjury in his congressional testimony.

George Bush was apparently high enough in the CIA to help plan the
Bay of Pigs invasion.  It would probably be safe to assume that he
even named the operation and its two ships.  Considering the hatred
that the CIA felt toward Kennedy over their failed mission and Bush's
involvement in that same mission, it would be quite interesting to
know what Bush's feelings toward John F. Kennedy really were and what
his full role in the assassination investigation was.

Further information on the George Bush connection may be obtained from
Mark Lane's "Plausible Denial" (Thunder's Mouth Press) and James "Bo"
Gritz's "Called To Serve."  Lane's book is an excellent accounting of
the CIA's involvement (especially E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis).
Gritz (a 1992 presidential candidate) tells about many of the CIA's
questionable ventures and also about his trips to Laos to attempt
rescues of American POWs who are still held by Vietnam.
