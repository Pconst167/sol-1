The following is a complete verbatim transcription from a recent broadcast of
"Network 23", a program shown on a local Los Angeles Public Access Cable
Channel.

FULL TRANSCRIPTION FROM NETWORK 23:
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

Good evening, I'm Michel Kassett.  This is Network 23.  A couple of weeks ago
we had a program on the subject of AIDS, addressing the question of whether
AIDS -- the AIDS virus -- was created by the government; and I'm sure that
some people were quite shocked by what they heard.  We spent that entire
program relating to you the evidence of a very substantial amount of factual
evidence which supports the proposition that AIDS is a synthetic biological
agent that was deliberately engineered by the US government as an instrument
of depopulation.  This is by far the most controversial and dangerous subject
that we have ever addressed on this program, so I would like to review briefly
the major points -- the most significant pieces of evidence -- that I
presented two weeks ago.

The first point was that in the early 1970's, Henry Kissinger wrote a top
secret document -- a National Security Memorandum ("NSM 200") -- in which he
indicated that "depopulation should be the highest priority of US foreign
policy towards the Third World."  This Memorandum which can be obtained from
the US National Archives, which was only declassified very quietly in 1990,
was adopted by the National Security Council as official US foreign policy
towards the Third World.  Now, this is a classic example of the "secret
government" in action, because of none of this was known to the Congress, and
certainly, it was not known to the American people.  Did any of you know that
depopulation was considered a matter of US national security?  Did any of you
know that for the past 20 years, depopulation has been the highest long-range
priority of US foreign policy towards the Third World?	No you didn't, because
it was classified -- it was a secret.

I would like to read for you just a piece of this document.  It is written by
Henry Kissinger:

"Reduction of the rate of population in these States is a matter of vital US
national security."  [National Security Memorandum, Henry Kissinger]

And we even have a map of those areas in which Kissinger indicates where
depopulation would be desireable.  It's all Third World countries -- it's all
brown people and yellow people, of course.

"The US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from
abroad, especially from less-developed countries.  That fact gives the US
enhanced interests in the political, economic and social stability of the
supplying countries.  Wherever a lessening of population can increase the
prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resources,
supplies and to the economic interests of the United States."  [National
Security Memorandum, Henry Kissinger]

Now, when Kissinger says "economic interests of the United States..." he means
the interests of US corporations, which are in fact, multi-national
corporations, with no loyalty to this country whatsoever.  NSM 200, unlike
other government documents on the subject, outlined "international and
political and economic implications of population growth..." rather than its
ecological or sociological aspects.  Like we have been saying all along, the
New World Order is a business, and the US Government is in the business of
business.

Now, the next document was from the US Senate Library.	It is a record of the
Appropriations Hearing that was held in July of 1969, where the Department of
the Army specifically requested and received $10 million to develop "a
synthetic biological agent that would impair or destroy the human immune
system."  This is from the US Senate Library.  We also made reference to
several published articles from the World Health Organization, written about
the same time, which advocated similar kinds of research toward the
development of "a hybrid virus that could selectively effect the human immune
system."

Like it not, these documents all exist.  The Kissinger Memorandum, the Army
Appropriations Hearing, the articles from the World Health Organization; these
are official records -- facts of history -- that can not be disputed.

We also pointed out an incredible coincidence.	The World Health Organization
went into Central Africa in 1972 -- into an area that is known as the "AIDS
Belt" -- and administered a smallpox vaccination to several thousands of
Africans.  This event was followed immediately by the first outbreak of AIDS
on this planet -- a remarkable coincidence -- that was noted as a Front Page
Headline in the London Times, but has never even been mentioned in the US
Media -- never even mentioned.

Another startling fact that was never mentioned in the mainstream media -- the
Hepatitis B Vaccine that was given to several thousand male homosexuals in New
York and San Francisco in 1978.  The fact is, every single person who received
that vaccine contracted AIDS -- every single one of them -- without exception.
That is what the first American victims of AIDS all had in common.  They were
receivers of the Hepatitis B Vaccine.  It is a document fact.  AIDS began in
America in 1978 in the homosexual communities of New York and San Francisco,
immediately following a government-sponsored program of Hepatitis B
Vaccinations.  This is all completely documented -- it is completely true.

In our first program, we made many references to material that you can and
should read, such as the Strecker Memorandum, by Dr. Robert Strecker.  Another
work called "Who Murdered Africa," by Dr. William Douglas.  And an incredible
book called "A Higher Form of Killing," which documents over 500 specific
cases of biological experimentation by our government on an unsuspecting
public.  If you don't think they do "that kind of thing," you are simply
uninformed.

We also read you an official government report from the Royal Society of
Medicine in Great Britain, in which they state unequivocally that "saliva and
blood are vastly more infectious than genital secretions," and "that AIDS
meets none of the criterion of a venereal disease.  That despite the
misrepresentations of the American Medical Establishment and the American
Government, AIDS is not primarily a sexually transmitted disease."  All of
that, according to the Royal Society of Medicine in Great Britain.  That's a
document that we have and we'll come back to it in just a moment.

We also shared with you information and opinions from many highly-respected
physicians, like Dr. Robert Strecker, Dr. William Douglas, Dr. Cantwell, Dr.
Hazeltine, Dr. Alonso, who all agree that the AIDS virus could never have
occurred spontaneously in Nature.  That animal viruses cannot jump species, as
we are being told they did, as we are being asked to believe happened -- when
allegedly, a green monkey bit an Africa and precipitated the pandemic of AIDS.
We know as a scientific fact that viruses cannot jump species, unless they are
specifically engineered to do so.  And we also know for a scientific fact that
the AIDS virus bears no resemblance whatsoever to any virus ever found in a
green monkey, but does bear a total resemblance to cow virus and sheep virus,
which have somehow been bonded together.  The only possible way these two
different species of virus could bond together would be in a laboratory --
something engineered in a laboratory -- and then further engineered to make
the jump into a human system.

We talked about the Laws of Virology, which state that for every case of
infection -- viral infection -- that is known and reported, there are 99 cases
that are unknown and unreported.  This means that if we have 200,000 known
cases of AIDS, then there are 20 million right behind it.  20 million
Americans who are HIV positive and do not know it.  We also shared quotes from
several doctors who believe that the HIV infection rate has now reached
approximately 100 million people on the Continent of Africa; 30 to 50 million
in Asia; and no less than 20 million in the United States.

Again, the Laws of Virology state that the rate of infection for a retrovirus,
like the AIDS virus, the rate of infection will double approximately every 12
months.  Another frightening fact that no one has bothered to tell us, is that
there are six different basic types of the AIDS virus, and that each of these
basic types, being what is called a "recombinant retrovirus," has a
recombinant potential of 9,000 to the Fourth Power.  "Recombinant" means the
ability to change and recombine into something new, and the calculation 9,000
to the Fourth Power times 6 is literally in the hundreds of millions of
trillions of different possible forms and manifestations of the AIDS virus.
[Note, the number calculated is 354,294,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 variations
of the AIDS virus].  Now that means that you would need a vaccine for every
possible choice that the virus could make, which is technically impossible;
truthfully, realistically impossible.  It's like the influenza virus --
there's no vaccine.  There are simply too many strains of it, too many
different varieties, to ever develop a single, comprehensive vaccine.

The bottom line?  We are not being told the truth about this plague.  In the
words of Dr. Hazeltine in his testimony to Congress:  "AIDS is a species
threatening disease."  Now, I don't want to appear to bleak or too hopeless.
All of these doctors believe that some type of cure is possible, but that
we're going to need a lot more money, and we're going to have to move beyond
the strangle hold of the Medical Establishment -- the AMA.  And since he lives
here in Los Angeles, I'm now going to put the number of Dr. Robert Strecker up
on the screen -- I'm going to flash that number for you now.  Please put that
up, thank you.	[213 344-8039].  I urge you to write down this number and to
make this call.  Please call Dr. Strecker.  All you have to do is call, and he
will send you information -- important critical information -- on the subject
of AIDS.

Alright.  About 3 weeks ago we played an excerpt from a speech by Craig Hulet,
and tonight I want to play you something else from that speech which relates
to the subject of AIDS.  For those who do not know him, Craig Hulet was a
former advisor to the National Security Council and a former consultant to
several multi-national corporations, and he has, as they say; "come in from
the cold..." -- he has crossed over and has spent the last 3 or 4 years
writing and lecturing on the subject of the New World Order - sharing with
everyone who will listen, the breadth and the scope of his knowledge and
experience.

Mr. Hulet knows first-hand the kind of men who are running the world.  He
knows what they're up to and he is trying to warn us.  Now, on this list of
alternative sources of information, which so many people are writing in to
receive -- you know all you have to do is send in a stamped, self-addressed
envelope, and we'll send you one -- the name at the top of this list is Craig
Hulet.	He is an indispensable connection.  So, right now I want to play for
you a small excerpt from a speech that he gave on July 25th at the Hilton
Hotel in Los Angeles.  His subject was George Bush and the New World Order,
but at the end of the evening, he was asked a specific question about AIDS,
and this is how he responded:

"... biological warfare virus by the US Military.  Sure...  I really hate that
subject.  You know, we're never, ever going to be able to prove -- Strecker,
William Douglas -- we'll never be able to prove that AIDS was developed
specifically to reduce the populations of Central Africa, the black inner
cities, drug users, prostitutes and homosexuals.  But it just seems strange to
me that all through the 1960's and 1970's, there were books published; [the]
Global 2000 Report to the President, [the] the Club of Rome wrote a book on
over-population -- I must have 50 books on over-population and the need to get
rid of a certain large amount of people on the planet.	Now, they never say
which people out to be gotten rid of, but it seems a major coincidence that
the same people that are starving in Ethiopia, in the Sudan, are the same
people that getting AIDS and dying.  By the year 2000, they expect 60 million
blacks in Central Africa to die of AIDS.  60 million!  It could be as many as
20 million in America.	Homosexuals, predominantly, and the interesting thing
is, it is not a homosexual disease.  It IS a man-made, mutated disease.  It
had to have been man-made.  Sheep do not get together and do chemical
experiments on their viruses.  So, a man had to graft this bovine virus, which
they know that's what it is, onto a human cell.  It had to be made.  So we
know its man-made.  They know it's transmitted with the... because they know
the most effective device... the best test to discover if you have AIDS... is
not a blood test, it's a saliva test.  Now why haven't they told us that?"

"It's not a sexually transmitted disease, it's simply a disease that gets
transmitted.  And you can transmit it by sneezing on someone.  Why don't they
tell us that?  In the Congressional Record, it says that it can be transmitted
"effectively" by mosquitos.  It says so.  The Center for Disease Control, in
the Congressional Record, says that it is transmitted by mosquitos in
Belgrade, Florida -- they know it for a fact.  Why haven't they told us that
AIDS is being transmitted by mosquitos?  They say it to themselves in the
Congressional Record, why don't they tell us?"

"OK.  Here's my theory.  Whether or not [AIDS] was created for the purpose of
exterminating the very same, coincidentally, same anti-social element that the
men I did business with for 15 or 20 years, though ought to be gotten rid of
anyways; homosexuals, prostitutes, blacks, etc., and of course, the Black
Continent -- they want the resources but they certainly don't want to feed the
people, see?  Why is that they are allowing all of these myths to be told --
the destruction to take place, and they're doing nothing to stop it?  Here's
my theory, and this is all it is -- is a theory -- that they'll find a cure
when about 1 billion people on this planet have died from AIDS, starvation and
disease -- all over the world, all of sudden Eli Lilly, who is one of the
major corporations doing AIDS research -- and coincidentally, George Bush on
the Board of Eli Lilly -- when they finally eliminate huge sections of the
population, which is what they always wanted throughout the 1960's and 1970's,
because of over-population -- it's called "mitigating the problem."  They feel
that AIDS and famine and disease will mitigate the problem of over-population.
I suspect that around the year 2010 or so, all of a sudden Eli Lilly will
announce that they've found a phenomenal cure for AIDS, but not until a lot
people die.  Because like I said, it seems a major coincidence to me that the
very same people that the men I did business with for years, dislike the most,
those people who just happen to be the ones that are contracting AIDS --
happens to be some of the ones that are dying in famines, pestilence and
bombing into the Stone Age like we just did -- I don't believe in the
"Coincidence Theory of History" -- I just don't.  I haven't for a long time
because the CIA, the National Security Council is too brilliantly planned.
They plan everything to the most minute detail.  I can't believe that all of
this is a coincidence.	That's all I can say though."

"I'm going to do a White Paper on that one of these days.  One of the reasons
I haven't is that if you talk about AIDS, you never get invited on the
university campus -- you follow me?  So I never address AIDS... for 4 years
I've had material on AIDS that addresses this in some fundamental way, and
some of it was very good documentation, proving some of the things that I just
said, but I have never discussed it because of you discuss AIDS, I guarantee
you, you will never be a speaker on the university campuses."  [Craig Hulet]

Once again, I want to say that even though it may not be proved in any
"absolute" sense, because absolute proof is impossible in a relative universe,
and that's one of the tricks of the cynic or the skeptic, is that they demand
absolute proof, knowing full well there is no such thing as absolute proof,
there is only evidence, and a certain point you make a decision on the basis
of the evidence -- you make a decision which becomes your belief -- on the
basis of the evidence.	So, on the basis of the evidence, it is my belief, it
is my conviction at a very deep level, that AIDS was deliberately created and
implemented by the United States Government -- more specifically by certain
individuals, most notably Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft and George Herbert
Walker Bush, who was the Director of the CIA at that time, when the Kissinger
Memorandum was adopted by the National Security Council.  I can't prove it
absolutely, by I personally believe that Bush was deeply involved -- a major
player -- particularly in the implementation of this epidemic.	There's an
article in the LA Times yesterday that says "Bush Defends AIDS Budget" and
"urges behavioral changes."  There was a protest demonstration in
Kennebunkport, Maine -- the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power marched through
the tiny downtown area of Kennebunkport.  Bush criticized the gay activists
for "hurting holiday business" in this picturesque New England resort, for
"hurting holiday business."

Quote (this is Bush talking); "To the degree the message hits some merchant in
Kennebunkport, on the best weekend possible, and caused them to close their
doors, I got that part of it, and I didn't like it."  This is one cold
reptile.  He goes on to say; "You know why they were here.  I know why they
were here.  They were here because you all are here," said the President to
the White House Press Corp.  "They were here because they can get television
coverage, and to some degree, print coverage, because the President happened
to be at home."

You see, he is contemptuous, he is contemptuous of the people that have this
disease.  A spokesperson for the demonstrators said that most of Bush's AIDS
policy has gone into research on AZT, a drug that they said, at best, can only
slow the progression of the disease.  It's like junk food for viruses.  As
Hulet just said, they don't want to stop it, it's "mitigating the problem,"
it's getting rid of the undesirables.  When asked what he thought should be
done about the AIDS crisis, Bush said; "I'm in favor of behavioral change."

Now what is the subtext?  What is he saying?  He's speaking to his 80%
constituency, telling them what they want to hear, and he is saying basically
that AIDS is caused by immoral behavior, immoral sexual behavior or immoral
drug use.  He knows that's a lie, but he is a liar, so what do you expect.
He's the master of deception.  He was in on it, I have no doubt whatsoever.

We said we were going to return this document.	This is the House of Common
Social Services Committee, and this is a document prepared by the Royal
Society of Medicine.  You can not get more official than this in Great
Britain.  And this is what they say:

"The scale of the deceptions and misinformation perpetrated by virologists,
clinicians and editors of scientific and medical journals about the
infectivity of genital secretions, compared with that of blood and saliva, has
been astonishing.  In the presence of a new, lethal virus, spreading amongst
people, for which no vaccine or cure is in sight, every person would assume
that scientists have been working day and night to verify how it is
transmitted.  On the contrary, having assumed for a variety of motives that
AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis or gonorrhea, a
negligible research effort has gone into the critical matter of transmission.
A few preliminary papers were published and their findings have been
repeatedly quoted as showing the opposite of what they actually showed.  When
this was pointed out in letters to the editors of American medical and
scientific journals, publication has been refused.  No attempt has been made
to check or double-check the findings in other laboratories, or to rectify
published errors."

"As far as it goes, the tiny research effort into infectivity of bodily fluids
indicates that saliva is far more infectious than genital secretions, but that
blood is vastly more infectious than either.  Consequently, the idea that
condoms can have any significant effect on the spread of AIDS in a nation is
utterly preposterous."

This is the Royal Society of Medicine in Great Britain.  I'll continue...

"Governments all over the world are spending millions of pounds [dollars],
advising their citizens to prevent AIDS by using condoms on the basis of
MANIFESTLY FRAUDULENT misrepresentation of scientific evidence."

You know, if they're going to spend millions of your tax dollars on televised
warnings, don't you think they ought to include cuts and wounds and saliva and
breathing it into the lungs, which apparently happens -- 16,000 health care
workers are infected by AIDS.  Ask them.  Ask the ones who believe their
superiors at the AMA about the costs of ignorance.  You want the truth about
AIDS?  Get outside the American Blackout.  Get outside the boundaries of the
so-called "freest nation on Earth."

Back in the 1960's you know, we used to feel sorry for the Russian people,
because we knew they weren't getting the whole picture.  We wondered what that
must be like.  My god, it was hard to imagine.	Well, now we know.  Now we
know exactly what it's like, to live in a society where crucial information --
information critical to our survival is being controlled and suppressed by the
government.

The bottom line?  Very serious bad guys are in control of your planet.	And
the name at the top of the list is George Bush.  George Herbert Walker Bush,
Emperor of the Earth and Supreme Commander of the Dark Side of the Force.

Well, we're out of time.  Good night.  I hope to see you all again next week.
If I don't, you will certainly know why."

		     SYNTHETIC BIOLOGICAL AGENTS

There are two things about the biological agent field I would like to
mention. One is the possibility of technological surprise. Molecular biology
is a field that is advancing very rapidly and eminent biologists believe
that within a period of 5 to 10 years it would be possible to produce a
synthetic biological agent, an agent that does not naturally exist and for
which no natural immunity could have been acquired.

Mr. Sikes.     Are we doing any work in that field?
Dr. MacArthur. We are not.
Mr. Sikes.     Why not? Lack of money or lack of interest?
Dr. MacArthur. Certainly not lack of interest.
Mr. Sikes.     Would you provide for our records information on what would
	       be required, what the advantages of such a program would be,
	       the time and the cost involved?
Dr. MacArthur. We will be very happy to.

(The information follows:)

The dramatic progress being made in the field of molecular biology led us to
investigate the relevance of this field of science to biological warfare. A
small group of experts considered this matter and provided the following
observations:

1. All biological agents up to the present time are representatives of
naturally occuring disease, and are thus known by scientists throughtout the
world. They are easily available to qualified scientists for research,
either for offensive or defensive purposes.

2. Within the next 5 to 10 years, it would be possible to make a new
infective microorganism which could differ in certain important aspects from
any known disease-causing organisms. Most important of these is that it
might be refractory to the immunological and therapeutic processes upon
which we depend to maintain our relative freedom from infectious disease.

3. A research program to explore the feasibility of this could be completed
in approximately 5 years at a total cost of $10 million.

4. It would be very difficult to establish such a program. Molecular biology
is a relatively new science. There are not many highly competent scientists
in the field, almost all are in univerity laboratories, and they are
generally adequately supported from sources other that DOD. However, it was
considered possible to initiate an adequate program through the National
Academy of Sciences - National Research Council (NAS-NRC).

The matter was discussed with the NAS-NRC, and tentative plans were made to
initiate the program. However, decreasing funds in CB, growing criticism of
the CB program, and our reluctance to involve the NAS-NRC in such a
controversial endeavor have led us to postpone it for the past 2 years.

It is a highly controversial issue and there are many who believe such
research should not be undertaken lest it lead to yet another method of
massive killing of large populations. On the other hand, without the sure
scientific knowledge that such a weapon is possible, and an understanding of
the ways it could be done, there is little that can be done to devise
defensive measures. Should an enemy develop it there is little doubt that
this is an important area of potential military technological inferiority
in which there is no adequate research program.

printed on the outside of the video box.

		       The Strecker Memorandum

With no cure and no effective treatment in sight, by the year 2000
A.D. everyone in the U.S. will be infected with AIDS. This videotape
presents the chilling conclusion of 5 years of exhaustive research by
Dr. Robert B. Strecker M.D., Ph.D.

This is the most controversial videotape you'll ever see. Dr. Robert
Strecker refutes, with documented evidence, virtually everything the
so-called experts and Government reports have told you about AIDS. He
asserts in no uncertain terms that:

   AIDS is a MANMADE disease...
   AIDS is NOT a homosexual disease...
   AIDS is NOT a vernereal disease...
   AIDS is can be carried by mosquitos
   Condoms will NOT prevent AIDS...
   There can never be a vaccine.

Although decades have passed and untold billions have been spent in
research, CANCER is still with us, the second major cause of death in
America.

The most dreaded fear that all oncologists (cancer doctors),
virologists and immunologists live with is that some day CANCER in
one form or another will become a contagious disease, transferable
from one person to another.

AIDS has now made that fear a reality and if you think you're safe
because you're not gay or promiscuous, or because you're not sexually
active, then you had better watch this videotape very carefully and
then watch it again and again if necessary, until you fully
understand what Dr. Strecker is telling you as he takes you step by
step and shows you how this dreaded disease was actually:

   PREDICTED...
   REQUESTED...
   CREATED...
   DEPLOYED...

And now threatens the very existence of mankind because

   IT WORKS!

Dr. Robert B. Strecker is a practicing Internist and
Gastroenterologist. In addition, he holds a Ph.D. in Pharmacology and
is a trained Pathologist.

=========================================================================

The following paper, entitled "IS AIDS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE"
was sent to me by Dr. Strecker who has no access to computer
networks for the explicit purpose of universal publication
without charge or consideration for the purpose of education only.
Further information is available as noted below.  The remainder of this
file is by Dr. Strecker.



IS AIDS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE?


THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM


     Thank you for requesting this information.    We
have a story to tell you, a very strange story, one
that affects you, me, and every other human being on
earth.	A story that must be taken seriously by the
governments of every nation in the world because there
may not be many humans left to govern by the turn of
the century, or shortly thereafter.  A story so
bizarre, and so sinister that, if it were not for the
fact that it is all true, it would make a great science
fiction thriller. (Interestingly enough, Lorimar
Pictures of Hollywood has purchased the rights to Dr.
Strecker's life story.)


The story begins in 1983 with Dr. Robert B. Strecker,
M.D., Ph.D.  Dr. Strecker practices internal medicine
and gastroenterology in Los Angeles.  He is a trained
pathologist and also holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology.
Dr. Strecker and his brother, Ted, an attorney, were
preparing a proposal for a health maintenance
organization (HMO) for Security Pacific Bank of
California.  They needed to know the long-term
financial effects of insuring and treating AIDS
patients.  In as much as this information was not
readily available in 1983, both brothers began
researching the medical literature to learn what they
could about this relatively new disease.  The
information they uncovered right from the beginning was
so startling to them, so hard to believe, that it would
dramatically alter both their lives and lead them on a
five year quest culminating with the creation of "The
Strecker Memorandum," the most controversial video tape
of our time, and a remarkable set of documents called
"The Bioattack Alert."

WHAT THEY DISCOVERED


Right there in the medical literature for anyone to
read for themselves was, basically, proof that the AIDS
virus and pandemic was actually PREDICTED years ago by
a world famous virologist, among others.  They found
that top scientists writing in the Bulletin of the
World Health Organization were actually REQUESTING that
AIDS like viruses be created to study the effects on
humans.  In fact, the Streckers unearthed thousands of
documents all supporting the manmade origin of AIDS.
Meanwhile, the government was telling everyone that a
green monkey in Africa bit some native and started
AIDS.  As their research continued, it became obvious
from the documentation that the virus itself was not
only created as requested, but actually DEPLOYED, and
now threatens the existence of mankind because it does
what it was designed to do:  cause cancer in humans via
a contagious virus. Eventually the Streckers came to
realize everything the government, the so-called AIDS
experts and media were telling the public was not only
misleading, but out and out lies.  The truth of the
matter is:


 AIDS is a manmade disease;
      AIDS is not a homosexual disease;
      AIDS is not a venereal disease;
      AIDS can be carried by mosquitos;
      Condoms will not prevent AIDS;
      There are a least six different AIDS viruses
      loose in the world;
      There will never be a vaccine cure;
      And on and on, but...

THE SCARIEST PART


The most dreaded fear that all oncologists (cancer
doctors), virologists, and immunologists live with is
that some day CANCER, in one form or another, will
become a contagious disease, transferable from one
person to another.  AIDS has now made fear a reality.
If you think you are safe because you are not gay or
promiscuous, or because you are not sexually active,
then you must watch "The Strecker Memorandum" very
carefully.

IF YOU PLAN TO HAVE SEX TONIGHT YOU HAD BETTER READ
THIS


The most common misconception being foisted upon us
right now concerns sexually active Americans.  We are
told that if a man uses a condom the transference of
the deadly virus is virtually eliminated.  Nothing
could be further from the truth. Of the body fluids
that the AIDS virus is found in, semen is the least.
As a matter of fact, in every single study ever
published on the subject, no one has found a
significant amount in anyone's semen.  It just isn't
there in huge numbers.	There is usually only about one
virus per milliliter, a statistically irrelevant
amount.  One copious ejaculation might produce only one
or two viruses.  This is substantiated in the medical
literature.  But, just for argument's sake, let's say
all the medical studies are wrong.  Let's pretend that
there are countless millions of AIDS viruses in the
ejaculation.  Are you aware that condoms are riddled
with microscopic or larger holes?  Studies show that
even the smallest holes found in condoms are two to ten
times larger than the AIDS virus.  It's like shooting a
golf ball through a basketball hoop.  Condoms have not,
will not, and cannot prevent AIDS.

THOUSANDS ALREADY DEAD


Fifty thousand Americans have already died because they
didn't know the truth about AIDS.  Between twelve and
fifteen million Americans have already been infected.
One in 60 babies born in New York City is infected;
one in 300 college students in America is infected;
one in 20 aliens applying for amnesty is infected,
including men, women and children.  These are just some
of the facts you are not likely to hear about from the
media.

WHY A VIDEO TAPE?


One of the first things the Streckers did was to try
and tell their medical and legal colleagues what they
were finding in the literature.  Some were interested;
most were not.	Certainly no one was prepared to risk
their professional standing by making waves within the
establishment.	Ted Strecker compiled some of the most
damaging documents into a report he called "The
Bioalert Attack" and sent it to every Governor of every
state, the President, the VICE-PRESIDENT (now
President), the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and selected
members of Congress.  He got a grand total of three
replies from three governors; nothing from the
government.  Both he and Dr. Strecker were laughed at
and ridiculed at every turn.  As an example, Dr.
Strecker told the government in 1985 that virtually
every person testing positive for AIDS would die
prematurely and painfully.  The government said that
was nonsense.  Their figures showed that maybe ten
percent at most would die from the disease.  In 1986,
the government said maybe 50 percent of those infected
would die, in 1987 they said maybe 75 percent, in 1988
they finally agreed with Dr. Strecker that AIDS is
virtually 100 percent fatal.  We could go on with facts
Dr. Strecker unearthed that the "experts" said were
wrong and now accepted as the truth.  Dr. Strecker,
like a good scientist, submitted paper after paper with
his findings to all the prestigious medical journals in
America.  They were refused.  He then tried having his
findings published in Europe.  Again, closed doors.
What to do?  Dr. Strecker did not feel he could take
the time from his practice and his research to write a
book.  On the other hand, everyone has a TV and now
most households have a video cassette recorder (VCR).
The time involved to make a video is nothing compared
to writing a book, and so the video "The Strecker
Memorandum" was created.  It is 96 minutes of the most
startling, controversial, and information packed video
you will ever see.  It disputes virtually everything
the American public is being told by the government,
the so-called AIDS experts and the media.  In fact,
after seeing it YOU will know more about AIDS than 99
percent of all doctors in America.

MUSIC IS NOTHING IF THE AUDIENCE IS DEAF


With the video made, it seemed a simple matter to
advertise it and the world would now become aware of
what it was facing, right?  WRONG!  The fact that you
are even reading about "The Strecker Memorandum" now is
a minor miracle by itself, in as much as TV stations
have refused to advertise it.  TV and radio time
brokers that sell blocks of commercial time have
refused to sell us time.  TV station managers have
refused to even air programs containing interviews with
Dr. Strecker.  A national radio network did an
interview with a famous talk show host and Dr. Strecker
and then refused to run it.  Virtually every big name
network television magazine show and all the syndicated
TV interviewers and talk show hosts have said NO to Dr.
Strecker. Big city newspapers will not take any print
ads telling about it, and so it goes...WHY?  What is in
"The Strecker Memorandum" that sends a cold chill down
the spine of most media executives?

WHY IS EVERYONE AFRAID OF "THE STRECKER MEMORANDUM"?


 The excuse that we hear over and over is that it is
too controversial.  TOO CONTROVERSIAL?	They say that
this information, if widely disseminated, will cause
the public to panic.  If someone had poisoned your
water supply and you and your family could die,
wouldn't you want to know about it?  Would you panic?
Or would you more likely be outraged and try to find
out who did it and punish them?  We feel the only
persons who might panic are those scientists who
willingly or otherwise created AIDS and are now
promoting misinformation by covering it up.  After all,
if you made AIDS would you tell anyone about it?

THINK OF YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS...NOW THINK OF THEM
DEAD


The number of AIDS infected people is doubling
approximately every 12 months, and in some areas even
sooner.  With twelve to fifteen million Americans
carrying the virus, you don't have to be a rocket
scientist to see how long we have here in the U.S.
Africa has, conservatively, 75 million infected; some
estimates double that.	Brazil as a country is in
serious jeopardy because all through the 1970's they
were buying their blood supply from Africa.  On top of
that, the World Health Organization conducted a large
scale small pox vaccination program there in the 1970's
(for the full implications of that see "The Strecker
Memorandum").  Southern Japan has about 30 percent
infected with HTLV I, the leukemia causing virus
(although you will never hear about that on TV).
Russia is now reporting AIDS as a problem and no one
can enter Russia permanently without a current negative
blood test for AIDS.  Cuba has already set up
concentration camps for AIDS infected and they are full
(you won't see that on TV either).  Haiti of course is
ravaged by AIDS; more than 15 percent of the people
infected and getting worse every day.  And so it goes.
Virtually every nation on earth with few exceptions
(Iran is one) is reporting a growing problem.  It's on
every continent, every subcontinent, and every island
chain, Atlantic and Pacific.  So why won't the media or
government tell you these things?  Is it too
controversial for you to handle?  Are you going to
panic?

IS THERE ANY HOPE?


Yes and no.  NO, if you are waiting for the government
to create a magic bullet.  As you will see in "The
Strecker Memorandum," part of the problem is that all
the various AIDS viruses are "recombinant
retroviruses."  Very simply, that means they have the
ability to recombine with the genes of any cell they
enter and the offspring or new viruses they form are
different from the parent viruses.  HTLV III alone
(that's the most common American AIDS virus) has the
mathematical ability to change itself
9,000x9,000x9,000x9000 times (which is 9,000 to the
fourth power).	The common cold recombines much less
frequently and we haven't found a cure for it after a
hundred years. Besides, does it make much sense to
entrust the cure for AIDS to the same people that may
have created it?  YES, there is hope if Dr. Strecker
and a growing number of realistic scientists are
correct in looking at alternative, nonallopathic, non
drug modalities based on Raman spectroscopy.  In fact
many experiments are going on now that offer great
promise.  Unfortunately, our government takes a dim
view of any type of treatment for any type of disease
let alone AIDS that does not conform to its rigid rules
for acceptance, registration, and legalization.  Of
course the FDA would definitely like to see an
allopathic drug treatment or cure presented by an
ethical drug company or university.  Well, we don't
think that's going to happen.  Because of this
attitude, much experimentation in America must go
underground, underfunded, or out of the country
entirely.  Again, this is explained further in "The
Strecker Memorandum."

BE BOLD AND MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME TO YOUR AID OR
MIGHTY FORCES WILL COME AND KILL YOU


An ominous personal aspect of this story has been the
sudden and unexpected deaths of two of the key players.
First, Dr.Strecker's brother, Ted Strecker, was found
shot to death in his home in Springfield, Missouri, an
apparent suicide, on August 11,1988.  Was Ted Strecker
suicidal?  Perhaps.  In the past he suffered from
depression and monumental frustration at the relative
lack of interest in his findings.  Dr. Strecker spoke
with him the night before his death.  Ted was cheerful,
in good spirits, and looking forward to certain new
developments that promised progress.  The next day he
was found dead, his 22 caliber rifle next to him.  No
note, no message, no goodbyes to anyone.  Very
untypical of him.  Officially a suicide.  Next.
Illinois State Representative Douglas Huff of Chicago
was found alone in his home, dead from an apparent
overdose of cocaine and heroin, on September 22, 1988.
Representative Huff did everything in his power to make
the Illinois State Legislature and the people of
Chicago aware of Dr. Strecker's work.  He was very
vocal, gave many press interviews, was constantly on
television and radio urging people to wake up to the
cover-up concerning AIDS.  Did Representative Huff use
drugs?	Perhaps yes, but only occasionally and
recreationally.  Was he an addict?  No.  Would he have
known how dangerous a massive overdose off cocaine and
heroin was?  Yes, of course.  Cause of death:
officially a stroke.  Dr. Strecker has serious doubts
that his brother killed himself.  Representative Huff's
associates doubt he died accidentally, and yet they are
gone.  Who's next?

IGNORANCE IS BLISS, OR IS IT SUICIDE?


We all know it is easier for a king to have a lie
believed than a beggar to spread the truth.  Well, we
are spreading the truth about AIDS.  Unfortunately, it
isn't pretty.  But the fact is you are not being told
the truth by the government or the so-called AIDS
experts.  The media, for reasons of their own, will not
present information contradicting the official
propaganda. So you can choose to go along with the same
people who gave us brain cancer (SV40 virus) as a
result of their contaminated polio vaccines in the
early 1960's; a polio like disease from their
contaminated Swine Flu vaccine in the 1970's; and AIDS
from their smallpox and hepatitis B vaccines; or, you
can at least make yourself aware of the clear and
present dangers that we all face by watching "The
Strecker Memorandum."  The cost of the tape is nominal,
but we submit that remaining ignorant can cost
infinitely more.
