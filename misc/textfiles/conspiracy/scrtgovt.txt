                             INTRODUCTION:  URGENT!

                   On July 5, 1987 the front page of the Miami Herald
         Newspaper carried a now famous article describing secret
         White House plans to:

         A.)       DECLARE AN UNDEFINED "NATIONAL EMERGENCY,"

         B.)       RE-OPEN CONCENTRATION CAMPS FOR PREVENTIVE
                   DETENTION OF LEGAL DISSIDENTS CERTAIN ETHNIC
                   GROUPS, AND

         C.)       SUSPEND OUR UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION

                                   ---***---

                   Those of us viewing the Iran-Contragate hearings,
         then being broadcast live on TV, had our curiousity peaked
         when one committee member began inquiring about an article
         alleging secret White House plans to suspend the
         Constitution.

                   We were even more puzzled when committee chair
         Daniel Inouye interrupted him demanding all discussion on
         that question take place in closed session, out of public
         hearing.

                   Not content to wonder, I researched the original
         article, transcribed it, and now present it to you for your
         urgent consideration.  You have a right to read this.  In
         fact, you'd better know about it because it's about secret
         White House plans to remove your rights by SUSPENDING OUR
         UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION.  It's about a government which
         we, the people, did NOT elect but which has gained power
         nonetheless.

                   What follows is not the whole story but a crucial
         and overlooked part of it.  Read "between the lines" and
         very carefully.  This is not some paranoid's nightmare or
         some fanatic's fantasy.  This is reality in the Reagan White
         House.

                             SOME SECRET ACTIVITIES

                   Sources say the parallel government behind the
                   Reagan administration engaged in secret actions
                   including:

         A CONTINGENCY plan to suspend Constitution and impose
                   martial law in United States in case of nuclear
                   war or national rebellion.

         1985 VISIT to Libya by William Wilson, then U.S. ambassador
                   to Vatican and close Reagan friend, to meet with
                   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi.

         HAVING ROUTES of sophisticated surveillance satellites
                   altered to follow Soviet ships around world.

         LAUNCHING of spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and
                   Nicaragua.

         PROPOSAL in 1981 to provide covert support of anti-
                   Sandinista groups that fled Nicaragua after
                   Sandinista revolution in 1979.

         DISSEMINATION of information that cast Nicaragua as threat
                   to neighbors and United States.

                                   ---***---

                   Before Reagan was elected, campaign aides who
                   became the president's top advisers carried out
                   these secret activities:


         CREATION in 1980 of October Surprise Group to monitor
                   President Carter's negotiations with Iran for
                   release of 52 American hostages.  Group met with
                   man who claimed to represent Iran and who offered
                   to release hostages to Reagan.  Offer declined,
                   officials say.

         ACQUISITION of stolen confidential briefing materials from
                   Carter's campaign before Oct. 28, 1980, Carter-
                   Reagan debate.

                    REAGAN AIDES AND THE 'SECRET' GOVERNMENT

                  by ALFONSO CHARDY, HERALD WASHINGTON BUREAU


                   WASHINGTON -- Some of President Reagan's top
         advisers have operated a virtual parallel government outside
         the traditional Cabinet departments and agencies almost from
         the day Reagan took office, congressional investigators and
         administration officials have concluded.

                   Investigators believe that the advisers'
         activities extended well beyond the secret arms sales to
         Iran and aid to the contras now under investigation.

                   Lt. Col. Oliver North, for example, helped draw up
         a controversial plan to suspend the Constitution in the
         event of a national crisis, such as nuclear war, violent and
         widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S.
         military invasion abroad.

                   When the attorney general at the time, William
         French Smith, learned of the proposal, he protested in
         writing to North's boss, then-national security adviser
         Robert McFarlane.

                   The advisers conducted their activities through
         secret contacts throughout the government with persons who
         acted at their direction but did not officially report to
         them.

                   The activities of those contacts were coordinated
         by the National Security Council, the officials and
         investigators said.

                   There appears to have been no formal directive for
         the advisers' activities, which knowledgeable sources
         described as a parallel government.

                   In a secret assessment of the activities, the lead
         counsel for the Senate Iran-contra committee called it a
         "secret government-within-a-government."

                   The arrangement permitted Reagan administration
         officials to claim that they were not involved in
         controversial or illegal activities, the officials said.

                   "It was the ultimate plausible deniability," said
         a well-briefed official who has served the Reagan
         administration since 1982 and who often collaborated on
         covert assistance to the Nicaraguan contras.

                   The roles of top-level officials and of Reagan
         himself are still not clear.  But that is expected to be a
         primary topic when North appears before the Iran-contra
         committees beginning Tuesday.  Special prosecutor Lawrence
         Walsh also is believed to be trying to prove in his
         investigation of the Iran-contra affair that government
         officials engaged in a criminal conspiracy.


                 ADVISERS FORMED SHADOW GOVERNMENT, PROBERS SAY

                   Much of the time, Cabinet secretaries and their
         aides were unaware of the advisers' activities.  When they
         periodically detected operations, they complained or tried
         to derail them, interviews show.

                   But no one ever questioned the activities in a
         broad way, possibly out of a belief that the advisers were
         operating with presidential
         sanction, officials said.

                   Reagan did know of or approve at least some of the
         actions of the secret group, according to previous accounts
         by aides, friends and high-ranking foreign officials.

                   One such case is the 1985 visit to Libya by
         William Wilson, then-U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and a
         close Reagan friend, to meet with Libyan leader Col. Moammar
         Gadhafi, officials said last week.  Secretary of State
         George Shultz rebuked Wilson, but the officials said Reagan
         knew of the trip in advance.

                   The heart of the secret structure from 1983 to
         1986 was North's office in the Old Executive Office Building
         adjacent to the White House, investigators believe.

                   North's influence within the secret structure was
         so great, the sources said, that he was able to have the
         orbits of sophisticated surveillance satellites altered to
         follow Soviet ships around the world, call for the launching
         of high-flying spy aircraft on secret missions over Cuba and
         Nicaragua and become involved in sensitive domestic
         activities.


                                Many initiatives

                   Others in the structure included some of Reagan's
         closest friends and advisers, including former national
         security adviser William Clark, the late CIA Director
         William Casey and Attorney General Edwin Meese, officials
         and investigators said.

                   Congressional investigators said the Iran deal was
         just one of the group's initiatives.  They say exposure of
         the unusual arrangement may be the legacy of their inquiry.

                   "After we establish that a policy decision was
         made at the highest levels to transfer responsibility for
         contra support to the NSC..., we favor examining how that
         decision was implemented," wrote Arthur Liman, chief counsel
         of the Senate committee, in a secret memorandum to panel
         leaders Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and Warren Rudman, R-
         N.H., before hearings began May 5.

                   "This is the part of the story that reveals the
         whole secret government-within-a-government, operated from
         the [Executive Office Building] by a Lt. Col., with its own
         army, air force, diplomatic agents, intelligence operatives
         and appropriations capacity," Limon wrote in the memo, parts
         of which were shared with The Herald.

                   A spokesman for Liman declined comment but did not
         dispute the memo's existence.

                   A White House official rejected the notion that
         any of Reagan's advisers were operating secretly.

                   "The president has constantly expressed his
         foreign policy positions to the public and has consulted
         with the Congress," the official said.


                                 Began in 1980

                   Congressional investigators and current and former
         officials interviewed -- members of the CIA, State
         Department and Pentagon -- said they still do not have a
         full record of the impact of the the advisers' activities.

                   But based on investigations and personal
         experience, they believe the secret governing arrangement
         traces its roots to the last weeks of Reagan's 1980
         campaign.

                   Officials say the genesis may have been an October
         1980 decision by Casey, Reagan's campaign manager and a
         former officer in the World War II precursor of the CIA, to
         create an October Surprise Group to monitor Jimmy Carter's
         feverish negotiations with Iran for the release of 52
         American hostages.

                   The group, led by campaign foreign policy adviser
         Richard Allen, was founded out of concern Carter might pull
         off an "October surprise" such as a last-minute deal for the
         release of the hostages before the Nov. 4 election.  One of
         the group's first acts was a meeting with a man claiming to
         represent Iran who offered to release the hostages to
         Reagan.

                   Allen -- Reagan's first national security adviser--
          and another campaign aide, Laurence Silberman, told The
         Herald in April of the meeting.  they said McFarlane, then a
         Senate Armed Services Committee aide, arranged and attended
         it.  McFarlane later became Reagan's national security
         adviser and played a key role in the Iran-contra affair.
         Allen and Silberman said they rejected the offer to release
         the hostages to Reagan.


                              Briefing book theft

                   Congressional aides now link another well-known
         campaign incident -- the theft of confidential briefing
         materials from Carter's campaign before the Oct. 28, 1980,
         Carter-Reagan debate -- to the same group of advisers.

                   They believe that Casey obtained the briefing
         materials and passed them to James Baker, another top
         Reagan  campaign aide, who was White House chief of staff in
         Reagan's first term.

                   Once Reagan was sworn in, the group moved quickly
         to set itself up, officials said.  Within months, the
         advisers were clashing with officials in the traditional
         agencies.

                   Six weeks after Reagan was sworn in, apparently
         over State Department objections, then-CIA director Casey
         submitted a proposal to Reagan calling for covert support of
         anti-Sandinista groups that had fled Nicaragua after the
         1979 revolution.


                         [THE IRAN-CONTRA CONNECTION:
             NORTH HAD BIG ROLE IN INNER CIRCLE, INVESTIGATORS SAY]

                   It is still unclear whether Casey cleared the plan
         with Reagan.  But In November 1981 the CIA secretly flew an
         Argentine military leader, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, to
         Washington to devise a secret agreement under which
         Argentine military officers trained Nicaraguan rebels,
         according to an administration official familiar with the
         agreement.

                   About the same time, North completed his transfer
         to the NSC from the Marine Corps.  Those who worked with
         North in 1981 remember his first assignments as routine,
         although not unimportant.

                   North, they recalled, was briefly assigned to
         carry the "football," the briefcase containing the secret
         contingency plans for fighting a nuclear war, which is taken
         everywhere the president goes.  North later widened his
         assignment to cover national crisis contingency planning.
         In that capacity he became involved with the controversial
         national crisis plan drafted by the Federal Emergency
         Management Agency.


                              NATIONAL CRISIS PLAN

                   From 1982 to 1984, North assisted FEMA, the U.S.
         government's chief national crisis-management unit, in
         revising contingency plans for dealing with nuclear war,
         insurrection or massive military mobilization.

                   North's involvement with FEMA set off the first
         major clash between the official government and the advisers
         and led to the formal letter of protest in 1984 from then-
         Attorney General Smith.

                   Smith was in Europe last week and could not be
         reached for comment.

                   But a government official familiar with North's
         collaboration with FEMA said then-Director Louis O.
         Guiffrida, a close friend of Meese's, mentioned North in
         meetings during that time as FEMA's NSC contact.

                   Guiffrida could not be reached for comment, but
         FEMA spokesman Bill McAda confirmed the relationship.

                   "Officials of FEMA met with Col. North during 1982
         to 1984," McAda said.  "These meetings were appropriate to
         Col. North's duties with the National Security Council and
         FEMA's responsibilities in certain areas of national
         security."

                   FEMA's clash with Smith occurred over a secret
         contingency plan that called for suspension of the
         Constitution, turning control of the United States over to
         FEMA, appointment of military commanders to run state and
         local governments and declaration of martial law during a
         national crisis.

                   The plan did not define national crisis, but it
         was understood to be nuclear war, violent and widespread
         internal dissent or national opposition against a military
         invasion abroad.


                               PLAN WAS PROTESTED

                   The official said the contingency plan was written
         as part of an executive order or legislative package that
         Reagan would sign and hold within the NSC until a severe
         crisis arose.

                   The martial law portions of the plan were outlined
         in a June 30, 1982, memo by Guiffrida's deputy for national
         preparedness programs, John Brinkerhoff.  A copy of the memo
         was obtained by The Herald.

                   The scenario outlined in the Brinkerhoff memo
         resembled somewhat a paper Guiffrida had written in 1970 at
         the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., in which he advocated
         martial law in case of a national uprising by black
         militants.  The paper also advocated the roundup and
         transfer to "assembly centers or relocation camps" of at
         least 21 million "American Negroes."

                   When he saw the FEMA plans, Attorney General Smith
         became alarmed.  He dispatched a letter to McFarlane Aug. 2,
         1984 lodging his objections and urging a delay in signing
         the directive.

                   "I believe that the role assigned to the Federal
         Emergency Management Agency in the revised Executive Order
         exceeds its proper function as a coordinating agency for
         emergency preparedness," Smith said in the letter to
         McFarlane, which The Herald obtained.  "This department and
         others have repeatedly raised serious policy and legal
         objections to the creation of an 'emergency czar' role for
         FEMA."

                   It is unclear whether the executive order was
         signed or whether it contained the martial law plans.
         Congressional sources familiar with national disaster
         procedures said they believe Reagan did sign an executive
         order in 1984 that revised national military mobilization
         measures to deal with civilians in case of nuclear war or
         other crisis.


                            ORCHESTRATED NEWS LEAKS

                   Around the time that issue was producing fireworks
         with the administration, McFarlane and Casey reassigned
         North from national crisis planning to international covert
         management of the contras.  The transfer came after North
         took a personal interest, realizing that neither the State
         Department nor any other government agency wanted to handle
         the issue after it became clear early in 1984 that Congress
         was moving to bar official aid to the rebels.

                   The new assignment, plus North's natural
         organizational ability, creativity and the sheer energy he
         dedicated to the issue, gradually led to an expansion of his
         power and stature within the covert structure, officials and
         investigators believe.

                   Meese also was said to have played a role in the
         secret government, investigators now believe, but his role
         is less clear.

                   Meese sometimes referred private American citizens
         to the NSC so they could be screened and contacted for
         soliciting support for the Nicaraguan contras.

                   One of those supporters, Philip Mabry of Fort
         Worth, told The Herald earlier this year that in 1983 he was
         told by fellow conservatives in Texas to contact Meese, then
         White House counselor, if he wanted to help the contras.
         After he contacted Meese's office, Mabry received a letter
         from Meese obtained by The Herald advising him that his name
         had been given to the "appropriate people."

                   Shortly thereafter, Mabry said, a woman who
         identified herself as Meese's secretary gave him the name
         and phone number of another NSC secretary who, in turn, gave
         him North and his secretary, Fawn Hall, as contacts.

                   Meese's Justice Department spokesman, Patrick
         Korten, denies that Meese was part of North's secret contra
         supply network and notes that Meese does not recall having
         referred anyone to North on contra-related matters.

                   In addition to North's role as contra commander
         and fund-raiser, North became secret overseer of the State
         Department's Office of Public Diplomacy, through which the
         Reagan administration disseminated information that cast
         Nicaragua as a threat to its neighbors and the United
         States.

                   An intelligence source familiar with North's
         relationship with that office said North was directly
         involved in many of the best publicized news leaks,
         including the Nov. 4, 1984, Election Day announcement that
         Soviet-made MiG jet fighters were on their way to Nicaragua.

                   McFarlane is now believed to have been the senior
         administration official who told reporters that the Soviet
         cargo ship Bakuriani, en route to Nicaragua from a Soviet
         Black Sea port, was probably carrying MiGs.

                   The intelligence official said North apparently
         recommended that the information be leaked to the press on
         Election Day so it would reach millions of people watching
         election results.  CBS and NBC broadcast the report that
         night.


                               CLARK HAD KEY ROLE

                   The leak led to a new clash between the regular
         bureaucracy and the president's advisers.  The official
         State Department spokesman, John Hughes, tried hard to play
         down the report, pointing out that it was unproven that the
         Bakuriani was carrying MiGs.  At the same time, employees of
         the Office of Public Diplomacy, acting under North's
         direction, insisted that the crates were inside the ship and
         that MiGs were still a possibility.

                   To take a closer look, the source said, North
         requested a high-flying SR-71 Blackbird spy aircraft be sent
         from Beale Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif., to fly
         over the Nicaraguan port of Corinto while the Bakuriani
         unloaded its cargo.  The pictures showed that the Bakuriani
         unloaded helicopters, not MiGs.

                   North was not the only adviser who operated
         outside traditional government channels, investigators have
         concluded.

                   Others were known as the RIGLET, a semi-official
         unit made up of North;  Alan Fiers, a CIA Central American
         affairs officer;  and Elliott Abrams, the current assistant
         secretary of state for inter-American affairs, according to
         Abrams' subordinate Richard Melton.  Melton revealed the
         existence of the RIGLET in a deposition given to the Iran-
         contra committees.  The name is a diminutive for RIG, which
         stands for Restricted Interagency Group.

                   Among the RIGLET's actions was ordering the U.S.
         ambassador to Costa Rica, Lewis Tambs, to assist the contras
         in setting up a front in southern Nicaragua.  Tambs, who
         resigned suddenly last year after his links to North were
         revealed, testified about the instructions to Iran-contra
         investigators.

                   But perhaps the key to the parallel government was
         the role played by Reagan's second national security
         adviser, William Clark.  It was during Clark's tenure that
         North began to gain influence in the NSC.

                   Clark also recruited several midlevel officers
         from the Pentagon and the CIA to work on a special Central
         American task force in 1983 to push aid for El Salvador, a
         task force member said.

                   "Judge Clark was the granddaddy of the system," he
         said.  "I was working at the Pentagon on another issue when
         my boss said that because of special circumstances, I was to
         be reassigned to the task force."

                   A former administration official familiar with
         Clark's activities said Clark also had approved contacts
         between Vatican Ambassador Wilson and Libya before Wilson's
         November 1985 journey, which came after McFarlane replaced
         Clark at the NSC.

                   The former official said Wilson also had carried
         out secret missions for the Reagan administration in a Latin
         American country where Wilson reportedly maintained contacts
         with high-level officials.  The source asked that the
         country not be identified because the system is still in
         place and had reduced tensions by circumventing the regular
         bureaucracies of both countries.

                   Calls to Wilson's and Clark's offices in
         California were not returned.
