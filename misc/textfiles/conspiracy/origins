Founding of the Modern Conspiracy to Rule the World
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

                               Mystery of Masonry's
                                  Origin Solved?

      Long-time readers will recall, probably with considerable
irritation, that we have been promising a definitive article on Francis
Bacon and the founding of the "modern" conspiracy since 1985.  Each time
we thought we were ready to finalize such a report we have discovered more
sources of information that threw the premises of the work up to that
point into doubt. 

      In spite of our promise that research was nearing completion in the
Washington DC:  Third and Final Rome?  catalog issued this Summer, a new
hypothesis has again cast doubt on our previous work.  Initially in 1985,
our theory was that the conspiracy was essentially Anglophile at core
beginning with Henry VII (1485-1509) and coming into its own with
Elizabeth I (1558-1603), suffering setbacks under the Catholic or Catholic
leaning Stuarts, but emerging triumphant with William of Orange's
"Glorious Revolution" of 1688 that resulted in the founding of the Bank of
England, Masonry, and the Royal Society under the patronage of the Crown,
thus, setting the stage for true world domination. 

      The Crown was seen as gathering otherwise unorganized and powerless
anti-Vatican forces into alliance with it such as Jews and Moslems (esp.
mystics--cabalists & sufis), Gnostic heretics, Templar heretics, etc.
rather than as a product of such anti-Vatican forces.  This allowed the
Crown to strike a pose above the fray while its Jewish and Secret Society
organs did its dirty work and received the blame...a theory the Crown
itself promoted with the unconscious help of the Vatican! 

      This theory met nearly 100% disagreement from all points on the
conspiracy research spectrum!  Of course, this was of no concern to us
since we consider the "established" conspiracy theories to be planted by
the conspiracy itself.  However, several books on the "continuity" of
Masonry began to sway our enthusiasm for our thesis.  Pro-Masonic scholar
John J. Robinson in his Born in Blood:  The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry
seemed to make an excellent case that Freemasonry was simply the Knights
Templar "revealing" in 1717 their unbroken existence since the attempted
Vatican suppression of their order in 1307.  Peter Partner's The Murdered
Magicians:  The Templars and Their Myth seemed to second this thesis on a
"power of myth" if not physical continuity basis.  Until now, we futilely
hashed over the pro's and con's with numerous correspondents while the
projected report languished. 

      Not until Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh of Holy Blood/Holy Grail
fame came out with their The Temple and the Lodge were we able to return
to our original thesis with good conscience.  Baigent and Leigh were able
to show convincingly how Templarism had survived continuously as Masonry,
originally under the patronage of the heretical Robert Bruce of Scotland,
and later under fragmented, doctrinally questionable, but basically
Vatican aligned, auspices, especially the Stuarts (Jocobites). 

      However, Baigent and Leigh also showed clearly that the founding the
Grand Lodge in 1717, far from being a "revealing" of a pre-existing Secret
Society, was an artificial take-over of Masonry by the then Protestant
Crown of Britain based on its military triumph over the pro-Stuart
Scottish Rebellion of 1715.  This was necessary to remove pro-Stuart
(Jacobite) and pro-Vatican elements from Masonry world-wide in preparation
for turning Masonry into Britain's premier covert intelligence service
(See August- September 1985 issue of the Project, page 6--"1717").  The
success of the British Crown in capturing Masonry ineluctably lead to
eventual Vatican repudiation of its previously loyal, if somewhat
heretical, underground intelligence network!

Year: 1972 Pages: 0359 Hardcover Price: $55.00 Rare/Out-of-Print

Contents:
Are "Secret Societies" pre-mass media propaganda instruments?  Are 
their zealous "enemies" the best agents for spreading their "never 
secret" message?  Amazingly the writing of this book by a fellow of 
Merton College at Oxford was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation! 
From the dust jacket blurb:  "...explores hitherto neglected 
territory...a specter that haunted European politics in the 18th and 
early 19th centuries, the bogy of the revolutionary conspiracy of the 
secret societies--above all, of the freemasons.  The book throws a 
penetrating light on a murky area of shifting and proliferating 
alliances between evanescent and shadowy organizations, and plots the 
careers of many of the conspirators who became demon kings of 
revolutionary Europe.  But his main concern is with the belief in a 
plot, rather than with the plotters themselves, at with the effects of
this belief on political action...the continually expanding myth, 
frequently spilling over into pure fantasy, exerted increasing 
pressure; it was a sinister fiction, but the effects it was allowed to
produced were all too real."

Project theory of Judeo-Masonic-Anglophile vs. Prusso-Vatican 
conspiracy theories.  Important information on the ancient Guelph vs. 
Ghibelline conflict within the Christendom which eventually coalesced 
into the current duality.  Also explores the "2-Germanies" theory: the
one Germany of totalitarian/militarist Prussians and Vatican aligned, 
the other Germany of cultured commerce by Merchant Princes of 
independent City States and British aligned.  Note:  The second 
Germany provided Britain with its Royal Family.
