Tom Bearden

  John Bedini has a prototype free energy motor.

  Imagine having a small D.C. electrical motor sitting on your laboratory bench powered
by a  common 12  volt battery.  Imagine  starting with a  fully charged battery and 
connecting it to  the motor with no  other power input. Obviously, the motor is go
ing to run off the battery, but by conventional thinking it will stop when the battery
runs down.

  It isn't running by the conventional  wisdom of electrical physics.  It isn't running
by the conventional rules of electric motors and generators,  but it is running.

  And it isn't something complex. It's pretty simple, once one gets the hang of the
basic idea.

  Impossible, you say. Not at all. That's precisely what John Bedini has  done, and the
motor is running now in his workshop.

  It's  running  off  the  principles  of  electromagnetics  that  Nikola Tesla
discovered  shortly  before 1900 in  his  Colorado  Springs  experiments.  It's running
off the fact that pure empty vacuum - pure "emptiness", so to speak, is filled with riv
ers and oceans of seething energy, just as Nikola Tesla  pointed out.

  It's running off  the fact that vacuum space-time itself is nothing  but pure masless
charge. That is, vacuum has a very high electrostatic scalar potential  - it is greatly
stressed. To usefully tap the enormous locked-in energy of that stress, all one
 has to do is crack  it sharply and tap the  vacuum oscillations that result.  The best 
way to do  that is to  hit something  resonant that  is imbedded in  the  vacuum, then
tap the  resonant stress of the ringing  of  the vacuum itself.

  In other words, we can ring something at its resonant frequency and,  if that
something is imbedded  in the vacuum, we  can tap off the  resonance in  vacuum stress,
without  tapping energy directly from the embedded  system we rang into oscillation.
So
 what we really need is something that is deeply imbedded in the vacuum, that is,
something that can translate the "vacuum" movement into "mass" movement.

  Well, all charged particles  and ions are  already imbedded  in the vacuum by their
charged fluxes, so stressed oscillations - that is, vacuum oscillations - can be
converted into  normal energy of mass  movement by charged particles  or ions, if the
sy
stem of charged  particles or ions is made  to resonate in phase with our tapping
"potential". For our purpose, let's use a system of ions.

  First we will need a big accumulator to hold a lot of the charged ions in the system
that we wish to shock into oscillation. We need something that has a big capacitance
and also contains a lot of ions.

  An ordinary battery filled with electrolyte fits the bill nicely.  While it's not
commonly known, ordinary lead-acid storage  batterys have a resonant  ionic frequency,
usually in the  range of from 1 - 6 Mhz. All  we have to do is shock -oscillate the 
ions in the electrolyte at their resonant frequency and time our "trigger"  potential
and  "siphon" circuit  correctly.  Then if we keep  adding potential  to trigger the
system  we can get all that  "potential" to translate into "free electrical energy".


  Look  at it  this way.  Conventionally "electrostatic scalar potential" is composed
of work or energy per columb of charged particle mass. So if we add potential alone,
without the mass flow, to a system of oscillating charged particles, we add "physica
l energy" in the entire charged particle system.  In other words, the "potential" we
add is converted directly into "ordinary energy " by the  imbedded ions in  the system.
And if we are clever  we don't  have to furnish any pushing energy to move pure po
tential around. (For proof  that this is possible, see Bearden's Toward a New
Electromagnetics; Part IV; Vectors  and Mechanisms Clarified, Tesla Book Co., 1983,
Slide 19, Page 43, and  the  accompanying write-up, pages 10, and 11. Also see Y.
Aharonov an
d V. Bohm, "Significance of  Electromagnetic Potentials in the  Quantum Theory", 
Physical Review, Second Series,  Vol. 115, No. 3, Aug. 1, 1959,  pages 485-491.  On page
490 you will find  that it's  possible to have  a field-free  reigon of space,  and 
still have the potential determine the physical properties of the system.)

  Now  this  "free energy resonant coupling"  can be done  in a  simple,  cheap system. 
You don't need big cyclotrons  and huge laboratories to do it; you can do it with
ordinary D.C. motors, batteries, controllers and trigger circuits.

  And  that's  exactly what  John Bedini has done.  It's real.  It works.  It's running
now on John's laboratory bench in prototype form.

  But that's not all.  John is also a humanitarian.  He's as concerned as I  am for that 
little old widow lady at the  end of the lane,  stretching her meager Social Security 
check as far as she can, shivering in the cold  winter and not daring to turn 
up her  furnace because she  can't afford the  frightful utility bills.

 That's simply got to change and John Bedini may well be the fellow who changes it. 
By  openly releasing  his work  in  this  paper,  he is  providing  enough information
for all the tinkerers and independent inventors around the world to have at it. If 
he can get a thousand of them to duplicate his device, it simply can't be supressed as
so many others have been.

  So here it is.  John has deliberately written  his paper for the tinkerer and
experimenter, not for the scientist. You must be careful, for the device  is  a little
tricky to adjust in and synchronize all the resonances. You'll  have  to fiddle with
it,
 but it will work. Keep at it.

  Also, we warn you  not to play with this unless you know  what you are doing. The
resonating battery electrolyte produces hydrogen, and if you hit it to hard with a
"voltage spike" you can get an electrical spark inside the  battery.  If that happens, 

THE BATTERY WILL EXPLODE, so don't mess with it  unless you  are qualified and use the
utmost caution.

  But it DOES work.  So all you experimenters and pioneers,  now's your chance. Have
at it.  Build it. Tinker with it. Fiddle it into resonant operation.  Then lets build
this thing in quantity, sell it widely, and get those home utilities down to where w
e can all afford them - including the shivering little old  lady at the end of the lane.

  And when we do, lets give John Bedini, and men like him the credit and appreciation
they so richly deserve.

[Note:  John Bedini developed Two kinds of controller devices.  One, being very simple,
is the one I will present here.  The other is quite a bit more complex, and  would be
impossible for me to reproduce here... Anyway if you want to  see the all electro
nic controller, get the book "Bedini's Free Energy Generator" by John C. Bedini, 
Published by the Tesla Book Co. 1580 Magnolia Ave.,  Millbrae, CA 94030.]

  For some time man has been looking for different ways to generate electricity. He has
used water power, steam power, nuclear power, and solar power.  Recent papers  written 
by  Tom Bearden  make a free  energy generator  possible.  Tom Bearden, rather 
than  patent his devices,  chose to share  them with people who had  open ears.  I
myself have  had  many  conversations  with Tom Bearden.  He found Tom to be one of 
the most reasonable men  he had ever dealt with in this energy field. Most  others woul
d tell you  stories of great  machines they had, but would  never  present  the truth 
with circuit  diagrams or  a look  at the machine in  question.  Tom, on the other hand, 
clearly presents  his ideas and clearly presents  his ideas and discloses  the
 concepts by means of which they work.

The facts I am about to present to you about free energy were never put into textbooks,
only portions were. The textbooks have grounded people in conventional theory and made
things very complicated. What I am  about to  explain  is  very simple;  anyone 
can  understand this  theory and  anyone  who understands what he is doing can build
this device.

  I have  been grounded  in conventional theory for some eleven years.  I  have always
tried  to  study  the  simplicity of electrical  circuits,  but  my mind wouldn't allow 
this because  of my orthodox  training.  In any event, I had to change the way 
i was looking at things.  I started to wonder, why do we need to have things so
complicated?  The truth of the matter is, we have been taught to consume or waste energy 
at every turn in our lives,  so we jump into our cars, turn on lights, etc.  In other
 words,  we have been conditioned to waste energy and  fuels lavishly,  not realizing 
that someday  someone will  sky-rocket our energy  bills  to a point  where we will 
not be able  to pay for  these fuels. Everything will come to a stand-still. But la
ugh as you will, at that time Rube Goldberg machines  will power your  future. It
probably will not be uncommon to see machines from the size  of garbage cans to the 
size of two story apartment houses powering  everything in sight.  These machines will 

be using a force in nature never conceived by the conventionally trained mind of today.

  The theory I am  about to explain  to you will  bring you  one step closer to gaining
free energy.

  To begin my story I must state I had a vision - looking for this energy. Many times
I hammered my head into the ground, but I refused to give up in my search. Any person
with  a dream should  never let it  be wasted by  fools,  who will always say "you 
can't do that". All that statement really means is that they do not know how to do it.

  There are  many different  ways to  explain this theory.  I will  discuss the first
one now.

  The device is very simple and uses a motor, a generator, a controller switch, and a
battery. Basically, we drive a direct current motor with pulsed current from a battery,
then utilize a special means to cause the battery to recharge itself.

  First, the battery, controller, and generator are interconnected as shown in figure
3. (See also Figure 1)

Let's begin by stating certain facts. The ions move backwards under charging
conditions and in reverse under discharging conditions. So here we start our new
concept. Suppose we have constructed a machine that has tricked this battery into a
different space and time relationship. Simply put, suppose the battery never did any
work 
and it should have its full charge left in it. Suppose this becomes possible because
we have stressed the terminals in such a way that the ions in the battery electrolyte
actually move themselves backwards. The machine, or unit, that makes this possible h
as many different names. Some people call these units generators, energizers,
alternators, etc. Conventionally such devices have one thing in common; they stress the
battery backwards by pushing electricity into the battery and forcibly pushing the ions
i
n the electrolyte backwards. In our theory, we are not going to push anything - the ions
are going to move themselves, recharging the battery.

If we go a little deeper into this theory, you are probably asking yourself, "what is
this madman talking about?" Simply put, we are going to put a stress on the battery
terminals for a moment in time and the battery will do the rest. Now comes the heavy 
part of this theory. What they didn't teach you in textbooks is that, in order for the
battery to charge, two oscillatory actions must occur, one at the positive terminal and
one at the negative terminal. Under different stress levels this then forces the
 ions backwards. The same would occur for an electron. Our machine will slingshot ions
in the battery electrolyte backwards beyond the normal recoil action.

  I must give a very stern warning at this time that if the voltage developed is too
high the battery will explode. Use the utmost care. Test setups in my lab have proven
that this can be dangerous. Do not build the device and experiment with it unless yo
u know what you are doing, and use the utmost caution.

  When struck by a sharp voltage spike, the electrolyte in the battery will resonate
at a certain frequency and this can also force the ions backwards. Simply put, the
battery, the motor, and the energizer will become resonant at some point, "ring" like
a
 bell when we "strike" it, and in its ringing the most energy will be developed.

[Note: sorry I can't produce waveforms here so get the book! I will present the
explanation here, however]

  The battery is really charging itself. The ions in the electrolyte are being stressed
in a curved space and time relationship, the battery is actually forced into believing
that no work ever occured. The oscillatory action that has taken place by the en
ergizer has just pulsed our "slingshot" and immediately let go. Once this has happened,
the electrolyte in the battery goes wild and the ions race backwards, giving off
hydrogen and oxygen gas. I must make a stern warning here! The time of the stimulaing 
pulse is very important. If the time is to long the battery will burn itself out. If
the pulse time is too short or if the circuit fails to operate correctly, the battery
will never recover its charge. Taking this into consideration, the only failures tha
t could occur would be the controller failure due to a points faiulre (on the electronic
controller), or the multivibrator latched in the "on" position (again, only on the
electronic controller). Anyone studying this can see that we have used very little 
energy to get to this point, and gained a lot of resonant energy in return.

  We must remember that, if the battery is applied to the energizer longer than normal,
we must burn up the excess energy to keep the battery cool. The problem now becomes one
of embarrassing excess of energy, not a shortage.

  The energizer is also a simple machine, but if yu want to, you can make it very
complex. The simple way is to study the alternator principles. The waves we want to
generate are like those that came from old D.C. generators with the exception of
armature
 drag, bearing drag, and no excited fields. Also, we would want to cut the magnetic
fields at 90 degress to the armature. The simpler the better.

  I am going to throw a few ideas your way. I have run some tests in my lab and
discovered that certain types of energizers, generators, and alternators do what we
need. Also, we want to be able to tune the output of our energizer. The old D.C.
generator 
puts out something very close towhat we need, except for The drag.

  In an A.C. generator output we are going to see just what we manufacture. It would
appear that this leaves this generator out. Not really, because we can make this
generator's output change by rectifying it.

  In looking at the A.C. generator with rectified output, we see that it could become
very useful to us as an energizer, simply because it is the easiest to construct and
its principles are simple. I have done experiments with an A.C. generator using ALL 
N. alligned magnets, and rectified. Most people can see that that type o alternator
might have some problems. However, remember that I am looking for a certain type of wave
form that I want to tune to a certain frequency at a certain speed. The winding of
 this alternatr is a problem and it is a bit tricky, but I chose to stay with this unit.
You may choose a different method if you retain the principle. The type of energizer
that was used for the prototype was a standard office type 2-speed A.C. fan housi
ng. The coils were replaced with 6 coils of approx. 200 turns of #20 wire - all in
phase. Six permanent magnets are bonded to an aluminum disc. This arrangement is
basically a magneto, but will produce more amperage than ordinarily expected of a
magneto.


Controller Construction: Figure 2 shows the controller. It should be made of two
coencentric circles, one with approx. 140 degrees of copper, the other, spaced far
enough from the first for a brush to be inserted between them, a full 360 degrees of
copper
. Provisions should be made to rotate the brushes in relationship to each other in order
to secure the required timing.

John  Bedini found  that the material  generally available concerning Kromery's
Converter had  been altered. Rebuilding the  Kromery Converter from  the patent papers 
ended up  in  a  non-functioning  device. Bedini  found  the  necessary modifications 

which made  this  machine  perform.

Our first  goal was  to determine  the converters  efficiency.  We  found  this to  be 
quite  difficult  as  the  efficiency  changes  with  the load applied.

Figure K-1  shows the  first  setup  we  used. We  drove the  Kromery Converter from
a  12v motorcycle battery.  We  connected at  the output  of the converter a  condenser 
and  a  rectifier  bridge  in  parallel.  The  rectified  current was then  put b
ack  into the  motorcycle battery.  To detect  any current flow, we  connect  into  the
positive line  a  12 V light bulb.

The result of this test was the light bulb was lit up. However after 15 minutes the
batrery  voltage had  dropped from  11.05 V  to  9.10 V.  The speed  of the converter
was stabale at 1020 rpm.

In the next  test we introduced  a seperate battery  (battery #2)  for charging from 
the  converter.

We recharged the  battery #2 from 12.30 V to 12.40 V  within 4 minutes,  and we measured
a current flow into the battery #2 of 0.8 amperes.

Figure  K-2  shows  the  second  test  setup.  Because  the  kromery  converter ran 
too slow on  one 12 V battery,  we decided to drive the converter using  24 V via tw
o 12  V batteries, connected in series.

  Next we wanted to find a correlation between the normal charging of battery #2 using
a commercial battery charger, and charging this same battery with the Kromery converter.
We drained the battery #2 to 8 V, connected it to the Kromery Converter, and af
ter reaching 11.51 V, we measured the time it took to charge the battery from this
voltage level of 11.51 V to 12.45 V.  We reached this voltage (12.45 V) after 11
minutes. The indicated current into the battery was 0.94 A.

We then repeated  these steps using the  commercial battery charger. Because we ran out 
of time  after nearly  2 hours, we  disconnected the  battery from the charger.  The
battery voltage had reached 12.41 V.  The measurement is depicted in Figure K-3.

   THE KROMERY CONVERTER NEEDED 11 MINUTES

      NOTE:  The charger could not fill up the batteries
             to 12.45 volts within two hours.


We wanted to  find a  correction factor for the Kromery  Converter by comparing the 
same effect,  i.e.  the charging  of the  same battery from  one  specific voltage to
another specific voltage. The calculation of this factor is avilable in  the book "E
xperiments with a Kromery and a Brandt-Tesla converter built  by John Bedini" By Eike
Mueller, with Comments by Tom Bearden. Table K-1 shows the combined test results.
Because  we  detected  an increase  in the  speed of the Kromery Converter as well as
a
 decrease in the input energy when  we  increased the output load,  we  decided  to 
measure the input energy and speed when  the output was shorted. Again, the input energy
dropped and the speed increased.

Using  the  earlier determined  correction factor  of 5.535 we  calculated  the energy
they put into the battery to 56.78 watts (from  10.26 * 5.535).  Looking at Table K-1
we see that it takes only 54.78 watts to run the Kromery Converter when the  outpu
t is shorted.  This result led us to continue  with theese tests and load the converter
output even more. The results of these tests can be seen in Table K-2.

Here again,  we detected  that we  would get a  higher efficiency  of the total device, 
the  more  we  load  down the  output side.  This  effect  is  totally contradictory
to the conventional laws of physics.

We used the Kromery correction factor for the First case, when we had connected the
battery to the  converter output.  We did not use this factor in both other cases when
we used resistors in the output circuit.

The above test results show  that the  efficiency of the  Kromery Converter  is well
above 100%.
