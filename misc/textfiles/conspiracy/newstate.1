arrange another election, on the third Tuesday in June, between
the two persons having the most votes; and if referendum so

development plans prepared by the planning staff.  They shall be
revised each year after public hearings, and finally in the year
before they are to take effect.  They shall be submitted to the
President on the fourth Tuesday in July for transmission to the
Senate on September 1st with his comments.

     If members of the Board fail to approve the budget proposals
by the forwarding date, the Chairman shall nevertheless make
submission to the President with notations of reservation by such
members.  The President shall transmit this proposal, with his
comments, to the House of Representatives on September 1.

development plans represent national intentions tempered by the
appraisal of possibilities.  The twelve-year plan shall be a
general estimate of probable progress, both governmental and
private; the six-year plan shall be more specific as to estimated
income and expenditure and shall take account of necessary
revisions.

     The purpose shall be to advance, through every agency of

discussion and the opinions expressed shall be considered in the
formulation of plans for each succeeding year with special
attention to detail in proposing the budget.

     For both plans an extension of one year into the future
shall be made each year and the estimates for all other years
shall be revised accordingly.  For nongovernmental activities the
estimate of developments shall be calculated to indicate the need
for enlargement or restriction.

                            SECTION 7

     If there be objection by the President or the Senate to the
six- or Twelve-year plans, they shall be returned for restudy and
resubmission.  If there still be differences, and if the
President and the Senate agree, they shall prevail.  If they do

                            SECTION 1

     There shall be a Regulatory Branch, and there shall be a
National Regulator chosen by majority vote of the Senate and
removable by a two-thirds vote of that body.  His term shall be
seven years, and he shall make and administer rules for the
conduct of all economic enterprises.

     The Regulatory Branch shall have such agencies as the Board
may find necessary and are not disapproved by law.

                            SECTION 2

     The Regulatory Board shall consist of seventeen members
recommended to the Senate by the Regulator.  Unless rejected by
majority vote they shall act with the Regulator as a lawmaking
body for industry.

     They  shall initially have terms of one to seventeen years,
one being replaced each year and serving for seventeen years.
They shall be compensated and shall have no other occupation.

                            SECTION 3

     Under procedures approved by the Board, the Regulator shall
charter all corporations or enterprises except those exempted
because of size or other characteristics, or those supervised by
the Chancellor of Financial Affairs, or by the Intendant, or
those whose activities are confined to one Newstate.

     Charters shall describe proposed activities, and departure
from these shall require amendment on penalty of revocation.  For
this purpose there shall be investigation and enforcement
services under the direction of the Regulator.

                            SECTION 4

     Chartered enterprises in similar industries or occupations
may organize joint Authorities.  These may formulate among
themselves codes to ensure fair competition, meet external costs,
set standards for quality and service, expand trade, increase
production, eliminate waste, and assist in standardization.
Authorities may maintain for common use services for research and
communication; but membership shall be open to all eligible
enterprises.  Nonmembers shall be required to maintain the same
standards as those prescribed for members.

                            SECTION 5

     Authorities shall have governing committees of five, two
being appointed by the Regulator to represent the public.  They
shall serve as he may determine; they shall be compensated; and
he shall take care that there be no conflicts of interest.  The
Board may approve or prescribe rules for the distribution of
profits to stockholders, allowable amounts of working capital,
and reserves.  Costing and all other practices affecting the
public interest shall be monitored.

     All codes shall be subject to review by the Regulator with
his board.

                            SECTION 6

     Member enterprises of an Authority shall be exempt from
other regulation.

                            SECTION 7

     The regulator, with his Board, shall fix standards and
procedures for mergers of enterprises or the acquisition of some
by others; and these shall be in effect unless rejected by the
Court of Administrative Settlements.  The purpose shall be to
encourage adaptation to change and to further approved intentions
for the nation.

                            SECTION 8

     The charters of enterprises may be revoked and Authorities
may be dissolved by the Regulator, with the concurrence of the
Board, if they restrict the production of goods and services, or
controls of their prices; also if external costs are not assessed
to their originators or if the ecological impacts of their
operations are deleterious.

                            SECTION 9

     Operations extending abroad shall conform to policies
notified to the Regulator by the President; and he shall restrict
or control such activities as appear to injure the national
interest.

                           SECTION 10

     The Regulator shall make rules for and shall supervise
marketplaces for goods and services; but this shall not include
security exchanges regulated by the Chancellor of Financial
Affairs.

                           SECTION 11

     Designation of enterprises affected with a public interest,
rules for conduct of enterprises and of their Authorities, and
other actions of the Regulator or of the Boards may be appealed
to the Court of Administrative Settlements, whose judgments shall
be informed by the intention to establish fairness to consumers
and competitors and stability in economic affairs.

                           SECTION 12

     Responsible also to the Regulator, there shall be an
Operations Commission appointed by the Regulator, unless the
Senate object, for the supervision of enterprises owned in whole
or in part by government.  The commission shall choose its
chairman, and he shall be the executive head of a supervisory
staff.  He may require reports, conduct investigations, and make
rules and recommendations concerning surpluses or deficits, the
absorption of external costs, standards of service, and rates or
prices charged for services or goods.

     Each enterprise shall have a director, chosen by and
removable by the Commission; and he shall conduct its affairs in
accordance with standards fixed by the Commission.

Judicial Assembly.

     It shall also be a duty of the Council, as hereinafter
provided, to suggest Constitutional amendments when they appear
to be necessary; and it shall also draft revisions if they shall
be required.  Further it shall examine, and from time to time
cause to be revised, civil and criminal codes; these, when
approved by the Judicial Assembly, shall be in effect throughout
the nation.

                            SECTION 5

     The Principal Justice shall have a term of eleven years; but
if at any time the incumbent resign or be disabled from
continuing in office, as may be determined by the Senate,
replacement shall be by the senior member of the Judicial Council
until a new selection be made.  After six years the Assembly may
provide, by a two-thirds vote, for discontinuance in office, and
a successor shall then be chosen.

                            SECTION 6

     The Principal Justice may suspend members of any court for
incapacity or violation of rules; and the separation shall be

senior judge, that there may be pretrial proceedings, that
criminal trials shall be conducted by either investigatory or
adversary proceedings, and whether there shall be a jury and what

                            SECTION 9

     The Principal Justice, or the President, may grant pardons
or reprieves.

                           SECTION 10

their senior, shall constitute a court.

                           SECTION 12

     The High Court of Appeals may select applications for
further consideration by the Supreme Court of decisions reached

Supreme Court.

                           SECTION 14

     The supreme Court may decide:

          a.  Whether, in litigation coming to it on appeal,
constitutional provisions have been violated or standards have
not been met.

          b.  On the application of constitutional provisions to
suits involving the Newstates.

          c.  Whether international law, as recognized in

          d.  Other causes involving the interpretation of
constitutional provisions; except that in holding any branch to
have exceeded its powers the decision shall be suspended until

avoid confrontation, procedures for amendment of the Constitution
are appropriate.

await the outcome.

Commission shall be constituted, four members to be appointed by
the President, three by the Convener of the Senate, three by the

     The President may make agreements with other organized
peoples for a relation other than full membership in the
Newstates of America.  They may become citizens and may
participate in the selection of officials.  They may receive
assistance for their development or from the National Sharing
fund if they conform to its requirements; and they may serve in
civilian or military services, but only as volunteers.  They
shall be represented in the House of Representatives by members
elected at large, their number proportional to their

     The President, the Vice-Presidents, and members of the
legislative houses shall in all cases except treason, felony, and
breach of the peace be exempt from penalty for anything them may
say while pursuing public duties; but the Judicial Council may
make restraining rules.

                            SECTION 6

     Except as otherwise provided by this Constitution, each
legislative house shall establish its requirement for membership
and may make rules for the conduct of members, including

be excepted by law; none shall occupy more than one position in
government; and no gift or favor shall be accepted if in any way

in office.  Hardships under this rule may be considered by the
Court of Rights and Duties, and exceptions may be made with due
regard to the general intention.

                            SECTION 2

have senatorial compensation and shall conform to senatorial
requirements.

     Justices of the High Courts shall have no term; and their
salaries shall be two-thirds that of the Principal Justice; they
and members of the Judicial Council, unless they shall have
become Senators, shall be permanent members of the Judiciary and
shall be available for assignment by the Principal Justice.

     Salaries for members of the Senate shall be the same as for

                            SECTION 4

          a.  for executive offices and official households,
appointed by authority of the President;

          b.  for the national courts, appointed by the Principal
Justice;

          c.  for the Legislative Branch, selected by a committee
of members from each house (chosen by the Convener and the
Speaker), three from the House of Representatives and four from
the Senate.

     Appropriations shall be made to them; but those for the
Presidency shall not be reduced during his term unless with his
consent; and those for the Judicial Branch shall not be reduced

     The Senate shall try officers of government other than
legislators when such officers are impeached by a two-thirds vote
of the House of Representatives for conduct prejudicial to the
public interest.  If Presidents or Vice-Presidents are to be
tried, the Senate, as constituted, shall conduct the trial.
Judgments shall not extend beyond removal from office and

official shall be liable to further prosecutions.

                            SECTION 9

     Members of legislative houses may be impeached by the

                            SECTION 1

     It being the special duty of the Judicial Council to
formulate and suggest amendments to this Constitution, it shall,
from time to time, make proposals, through the Principal Justice,
to the Senate.  The Senate, if it approve, and if the President
agree, shall instruct the Overseer to arrange at the next
national election for submission of the amendment to the
electorate.  If not disapproved by a majority, it shall become
part of this Constitution.  If rejected, it may be restudied and
a new proposal submitted.

     It shall be the purpose of the amending procedure to correct
deficiencies in the Constitution, to extend it when new
responsibilities require, and to make government responsible to
needs of the people, making use of advances in managerial
competence and establishing security and stability; also to
preclude changes in the Constitution resulting from
interpretation.

                            SECTION 2

     When this Constitution shall have been in effect for twenty-
five years the Overseer shall ask, by referendum whether a new
Constitution shall be prepared.  If a majority so decide, the
Council, making use of such advice as may be available, and
consulting those who have made complaint, shall prepare a new
draft for submission at the next election.  If not disapproved by
a majority it shall be in effect.  If disapproved it shall be
redrafted and resubmitted with such changes as may be then
appropriate to the circumstances, and it shall be submitted to
the voters at the following election.

     If not disapproved by a majority it shall be in effect.  If
disapproved it shall be restudied and resubmitted.

                           ARTICLE XII

                            SECTION 1

     The president is authorized to assume such powers, make such
appointments, and use such funds as are necessary to make this
Constitution effective as soon as possible after acceptance by a
referendum he may initiate.

                            SECTION 2

     Such members of the Senate as may be at once available shall
convene and, if at least half, shall constitute sufficient
membership while others are being added.  They shall appoint an
Overseer to arrange for electoral organization and elections for
the offices of government; but the President and Vice-Presidents
shall serve out their terms and then become members of the
Senate.  At that time the presidency shall be constituted as
provided in the Constitution.

                            SECTION 3

     Until each indicated change in the government shall have
been completed the provisions of the existing Constitution and
the organs of government shall be in effect.

                            SECTION 4

     All operations of the national government shall cease as
they are replaced by those authorized under this Constitution.

     The President shall determine when replacement is complete.

     The President shall cause to be constituted an appropriate
commission to designate existing laws inconsistent with this
Constitution, and they shall be void; also the commission shall
assist the President and the legislative houses in the
formulating of such laws as may be consistent with the
Constitution and necessary to its implementation.

                            SECTION 5

     For establishing Newstates' boundaries a commission of
thirteen, appointed by the President, shall make recommendations
within one year.  For this purpose the members may take advice
and commission studies concerning resources, population,
transportation, communication, economic and social arrangements,
and such other conditions as may be significant.  The President
shall transmit the commission's report to the Senate.  After
entertaining, if convenient, petitions for revision, the Senate
shall report whether the recommendations are satisfactory but the
President shall decide whether they shall be accepted or shall be
returned for revision.

     Existing states shall not be divided unless metropolitan
areas extending over more than one state are to be included in
one Newstate, or unless other compelling circumstances exist; and
each Newstate shall possess harmonious regional characteristics.

     The Commission shall continue while the Newstates make
adjustments among themselves and shall have jurisdiction in
disputes arising among them.

                            SECTION 6

     Constitutions of the Newstates shall be established as
arranged by the Judicial Council and the Principal Justice.

     These procedures shall be as follows:  Constitutions shall
be drafted by the highest courts of the Newstates.  There shall
then be a convention of one hundred delegates chosen in special
elections in a procedure approved by the Overseer.  If the
Constitution be not rejected, the Principal Justice, advised by
the Judicial Council, shall promulgate a Constitution and
initiate revisions to be submitted for approval at a time he
shall appoint.  If it again be rejected he shall promulgate
another, taking account of objections, and it shall be in effect.
A Constitution, once in effect, shall be valid for twenty-five
years as herein provided.

                            SECTION 7

     Until Governors and legislatures of the Newstates are
seated, their governments shall continue, except that the
President may appoint temporary Governors to act as executives
until succeeded by those regularly elected.  These Governors
shall succeed to the executive functions of the states as they
become one of the Newstates of America.

                            SECTION 8

     The indicated appointments, elections, and other
arrangements shall be made with all deliberate speed.

                            SECTION 9

     The first Judicial Assembly for selecting a register for
candidates for the Principal Justiceship of the Newstates of
America shall be called by the incumbent Chief Justice

                           SECTION 10

     Newstates electing by referendum not to comply with
recommendations of the Boundary Commission, as approved by the
Senate, shall have deducted from taxes collected by the Newstates
of America for transmission to them a percentage equal to the
loss in efficiency from failure to comply.

     Estimates shall be made by the Chancellor of Financial
Affairs and approved by the President; but the deduction shall
