The following pamphlet was written in 1989 by a minister (now
deceased) who had the courage and inspiration to explain in
very simple and uncluttered language -- how it is that we
are presently being ENSLAVED and IMPOVERISHED by the current
"debt-usury banking system" that we have.

It was written for a predominately Christian audience (which may
or may not be your cup of tea), and some of the information
may be a little dated (the figures for the debt, for example, 
have increased astronomically since it was penned) but regardless
of that -- it is a clear and URGENT message that needs to be
listened to by the American people.

Keep in mind, also, that according to William Cooper ("Behold
a Pale Horse" p. 80-81) -- in the year 1952, an alliance was 
formed between all the various groups that are working for total 
financial enslavement of the worlds' peoples: The Illuminati,
Knights of Malta, Freemasons, European and Continental Banking 
Families, etc..  Thus, it is NOT any one group or subgroup of 
this alliance (referred to as the "Bankers" in the text) that 
is doing it to us.

       "The love of money is the root of all evil": (1 Timothy 6:10)

    "If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou
    shalt not be to him an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him
    usury."  Exodus 22:25

    "Take no usury of him, or increase ... thou shalt not give him thy 
    money upon usury."  Leviticus 25:36-37

    "Unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: That the Lord
    they God bless thee."  Deuteronomy 23:20

    In the early Church, any interest on debt was considered usury.
    Read below to see what interest (usury) on debts, a violation of
    God's Law, is doing to America.

                            THE NATIONAL DEBT

 
   In 1901 the national debt of the United States was less than $1 billion.
 It stayed at less than $1 billion until we got into World War I. Then it
 jumped to $25 billion.

   Between 1918 and 1941, on the eve of World War II, the national debt
 just about doubled -- from $25 to $49 billion.

   Between 1942 and 1952, the debt went from $72 billion to $265 billion.
 In 1962 it was $303 billion. Eight years later, in 1970, it was $383
 billion.

   Between 1971 and 1976 it rose from $409 billion to $631 billion. The 
 estimated debt at the end of this year [1977] is $727 billion, and
 next year it is expected to top $800 billion -- having nearly doubled
 in the past eight years.
 
   If the present trend continues, and there is no evidence whatsoever
 that it will not continue, we can expect the national debt to nearly
 double again within the next six to eight years.  By then, the INTEREST
 in the debt alone should be in the $400 billion a year range. 
 
 [Transcriber's note: As of 1996, the official debt about 5 TRILLION].
 
 Eventually, the government will own nothing, the people will own
 nothing, the banks will own everything.

   "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the
    issue of their money, first by inflation and then by deflation, 
    the banks and corporations that will grow up around them [around
    the banks], will deprive the people of their property until their
    children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers
    conquered."

                         THREE TYPES OF CONQUEST

 
 History reveals nations can be conquered by the use of one or more of
 three methods.

 The most common is conquest by war. In time, though, this method usually
 fails, because the captives hate the captors and rise up and drive them
 out if they can. Much force is needed to maintain control, making it
 expensive for the conquering nation.

 A second method is by religion, where men are convinced they must give
 their captors part of their earnings as "obedience to God." Such a
 captivity is vulnerable to philosophical exposure or by overthrow by 
 armed force, since religion by its nature lacks military force to 
 regain control, once its captives become "disillusioned."

 The third method can be called economic conquest. It takes place when
 nations are placed under "tribute" without the use of visible force or
 coercion, so that the victims do not realize they have been conquered. 
 "Tribute" is collected from them in the form of "legal" debts and taxes,
 and they believe they are paying it for their own good, for the good of
 others, or to protect all from some enemy. Their captors become their
 "benefactors" and "protectors".

 Although this is the slowest to impose, it is often quite long lasting, 
 as the captives do not see any military force arrayed against them, their
 religion is left more or less intact, they have freedom to speak and
 to travel, and they participate in "elections" for their rulers. Without
 realizing it, they are conquered, and the instruments of their own society
 are used to transfer their wealth to their captors and make the conquest
 complete.

 In 1900 the average American worker paid few taxes and had little debt. 
 Last year payments on debts and taxes took more than half of what he 
 earned. Is it possible a form of conquest has been imposed on our people?
 Read the following pages and decide for yourself. And may God have mercy
 on this once debt-free and great nation, in Christ,

              THE REAL STORY OF THE MONEY-CONTROL OVER AMERICA

                                  by
                          
                         Pastor Sheldon Emry
 
 
   [Cartoon showing a mother standing in front of a judge in divorce
   court, holding the hand of her small boy and girl -- with her
   husband sitting in the witness chair, holding his head in gloom.
   The mother says to the judge, "AND JUDGE, WE WERE ALWAYS IN DEBT!."]

                              
                              *  *  *

   
   Americans, living in what is called the richest nation on earth, seem
 always to be short of money.  Wives are working in unprecedented numbers,
 husbands hope for overtime hours to earn more, or take part-time jobs
 evenings and weekends, children look for odd jobs for spending money,
 the family debt climbs higher, and psychologists say one of the biggest
 causes of family quarrels and breakups is "arguments over money."  Much
 of this trouble can be traced to our present "debt-money" system.

   Too few Americans realize why Christian Statesmen wrote into Article I
 of the U.S. Constitution:

             
             "Congress shall have the Power to Coin Money and 
              Regulate the Value Thereof."
    

   They did this, as we will show, in prayerful hope that it would prevent 
 "love of money" from destroying the republic they had founded. We shall 
 see how subversion of Article I has brought on us the "evil" of which 
 God's Word had warned.
 

                       MONEY IS MAN'S ONLY "CREATION"


   Economists use the term "create" when speaking of the process by which
 money comes into existence.  Now, "creation" means making something which 
 did not exist before.  Lumbermen make boards from trees, workers build
 houses from lumber, and factories manufacture automobiles from metal,
 glass and other materials.  But in all these they did not "create,"  
 They only changed existing materials into a more usable and, therefore, 
 more valuable form.  This is not so with money.  Here, and here alone, 
 man actually "creates" something out of nothing.

   A piece of paper of little value is printed so that it is worth a piece 
 of lumber. With different figures it can buy the automobile or even the 
 house. It's value has been "created" in the true meaning of the word.

                
                   "CREATING" MONEY IS VERY PROFITABLE!

   As is seen by the above, money is very cheap to make, and whoever does 
 the "creating" of money in a nation can make a tremendous profit! 
 Builders work hard to make a profit of 5% above their cost to build a 
 house.

   Auto makers sell their cars for 1% to 2% above the cost of manufacture 
 and it is considered good business. But money "manufactures" have no limit 
 on their profits, since a few cents will print a $1 bill or a $10,000 bill.

   That profit is part of our story, but first let consider another unique
 characteristic of the thing -- money, the love of which is the "root of
 all evil".

                  
                       ADEQUATE MONEY SUPPLY NEEDED

   An adequate supply of money is indispensable to civilized society. We
 could forego many other things but without money industry would grind to
 a halt, farms would become only self-sustaining units, surplus food would
 disappear, jobs requiring the work of more than one man or one family
 would remain undone, shipping and large movement of goods would cease,
 hungry people would plunder and kill to remain alive, and all government
 except family or tribe would cease to function.

   An overstatement, you say? Not at all. Money is the blood of civilized
 society, the means of all commercial trade except simple barter. It is 
 the measure and the instrument by which one product is sold and another
 purchased.  Remove money or even reduce the supply below that which is
 necessary to carry on current levels of trade, and the results are
 catastrophic.  For an example, we need only look at America's Depression 
 of the early 1930's.

                
                THE BANKER'S DEPRESSION OF THE 1930'S


   In 1930 America did not lack industrial capacity, fertile farmland,
 skilled and willing workers or industrious farm families. It had an 
 extensive and efficient transportation system in railroads, road networks, 
 and inland and ocean waterways.

 Communications between regions and localities were the best in the world, 
 utilizing telephone, teletype, radio, and a well-operated government mail 
 system.  No war had ravaged the cities or the countryside, no pestilence 
 weakened the population, nor had famine stalked the land.  The United 
 States of America in 1930 lacked only one thing: an adequate supply of 
 money to carry on trade and commerce.

   In the early 1930s, Bankers, the only source of new money and credit,
 deliberately refused loans to industries, stores and farms.  Payments on
 existing loans were required however, and money rapidly disappeared from
 circulation.  Goods were available to be purchased, jobs waiting to be
 done, but the lack of money brought the nation to a standstill.  
 
 By this simple ploy America was put in a "depression" and the greedy 
 Bankers took possession of hundreds of thousands of farms, homes, and 
 business properties.  The people were told, "times are hard" and "money 
 is short."  Not understanding the system, they were cruelly robbed of 
 their earnings, their savings, and their property.

                          MONEY FOR PEACE?  NO!   
     
                          MONEY FOR WAR?   YES!

   
   World War II ended the "depression."  The same Bankers who in the 
 early 30's had no loans for peacetime houses, food and clothing, 
 suddenly had unlimited billions to lend for Army barracks, K-rations 
 and uniforms!  A nation that in 1934 couldn't produce food for sale, 
 suddenly could produce bombs to send free to Germany and Japan! (More 
 on this riddle later).

   With the sudden increase in money, people were hired, farms sold 
 their produce, factories went to two shifts, mines re-opened, and "The 
 Great Depression" was over!  Some politicians were blamed for it and 
 others took credit for ending it.  The truth is the lack of money (caused 
 by the Bankers) brought on the depression, and adequate money ended it. 
 The people were never told that simple truth and in this article we will 
 endeavor to show how these same Bankers who control our money and credit 
 have used their control to plunder America and place us in bondage.

                     POWER TO COIN AND REGULATE MONEY
   
   When we can see the disastrous results of an artificially created 
 shortage of money, we can better understand why our Founding Fathers, who
 understood both money and God's Laws, insisted on placing the power to
 "create" money and the power to control it ONLY in the hands of the
 Federal Congress. 

 They believed that ALL Citizens should share in the profits of its
 "creation" and therefore the Federal government must be the ONLY creator
 of money. They further believed that ALL citizens, of whatever State
 or Territory, or station in life, would benefit by an adequate and stable
 currency, and therefore, the national government must also be, by law, 
 the ONLY controller of the value of money.

   Since the Federal Congress was the only legislative body subject to all
 the citizens at the ballot box, it was, to their minds, the only safe
 depository of so much profit and so much power. They wrote it out in the
 simple, but all inclusive: 
 
           "Congress shall have the Power to Coin Money and 
            Regulate the Value Thereof."


             HOW THE PEOPLE LOST CONTROL T0 THE FEDERAL RESERVE

   Instead of the Constitutional method of creating our money and putting 
 it into circulation, we now have and entirely unconstitutional system. 
 This has brought our country to the brink of disaster, as we shall see.

   Since our money was handled both legally and illegally before 1913, we
 shall consider only the years following 1913, since from that year on, ALL
 of our money had been created and issued by an illegal method that will
 eventually destroy the United States if it is not changed.  Prior to 1913,
 America was a prosperous, powerful, and growing nation, at peace with its
 neighbors and the envy of the world. But -- in December of 1913, Congress,
 with many members away for the Christmas holidays, passed what has since
 been known as the FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. (For the full story of how this
 infamous legislation was forced through our Congress, read "Conquest or
 Consent", by W. D. Vennard). 

 Omitting the burdensome details, it simply authorized the establishment of
 a Federal Reserve Corporation, with a Board of Directors (The Federal
 Reserve Board) to run it, and the United States was divided into 12 
 Federal Reserve "Districts."

_____________________________________________________________________________

                                                                 p. 7

   This simple, but terrible, law completely removed from Congress the 
 right to "create" money or to have any control over its "creation", and 
 gave that function to The Federal Reserve Corporation.  This was done with
 appropriate fanfare and propaganda that this would "remove money from 
 politics" (they didn't say "and therefore from the people's control") and 
 prevent "Boom and Bust" from hurting our citizens. 

 The people were not told then, and most still do not know today, that the
 Federal Reserve Corporation is a private corporation controlled by bankers
 and therefore is operated for the financial gain of the bankers over the
 people rather than for the good of the people. The word "Federal" was used
 only to deceive the people.

                        
                     MORE DISASTROUS THAN PEARL HARBOR

   Since that "day of infamy", more disastrous to us than Pearl Harbor, the
 small group of "privileged" people who lend us "our" money have accrued to
 themselves all of the profits of printing our money -- and more!  Since
 1913 they have "created" tens of billions of dollars in money and credit,
 which, as their own personal property, they then lend to our government 
 and our people at interest. 

 "The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" had become the secret policy
 of the Federal government.  An example of the process of "creation" and its
 conversion to peoples "debt" will aid our understanding.


                THEY PRINT IT --

                      WE BORROW IT AND PAY THEM INTEREST
   
   We shall start with the need for money.  The Federal Government, having
 spent more than it has taken from its citizens in taxes, needs, for the
 sake of illustration, $1,000,000,000.  Since it does not have the money,
 and Congress has given away its authority to "create" it, the Government
 must go to the "creators" for the $1 billion. 

 But, the Federal Reserve, a private corporation, doesn't just give its
 money away!  The Bankers are willing to deliver $1,000,000,000 in money 
 or credit to the Federal Government in exchange for the Government's
 agreement to pay it back -- with interest.  So Congress authorizes the
 Treasury Department to print $1,000,000,000 in U.S. Bonds, which are then
 delivered to the Federal Reserve Bankers.

_____________________________________________________________________________

                                                                 p. 8

   The Federal Reserve then pays the cost of printing the $1 billion (about
 $1,000) and makes the exchange.  The government then uses the money to pay
 its obligations. What are the results of this fantastic transaction?  Well,
 $1 billion in Government bills are paid all right, but the Government has
 now indebted the people to the Bankers for $1 billion on which the people
 must pay interest! 

 Tens of thousands of such transactions have taken place since 1913 so that
 by the 1980s, the U.S. Government is indebted to the Bankers for over
 $1,000,000,000,000 (trillion), on which the people pay over $100 billion
 a year in interest alone with no hope of ever paying off the principal.
 Supposedly, our children and following generations will pay forever and 
 forever! (Since this book was printed in 1984, the national debt has
 grown to today's 1989 total of approximately 3 trillion dollars.)
 
 [Transcriber's note: As of 1996, it is approximately 5 trillion dolllars].

                            AND THERE'S MORE

   You say, "This is terrible!"  Yes, it is, but we have shown only part of
 the sordid story.  Under this unholy system, those United States Bonds have
 now become "assets" of the Banks in the Reserve System, which they then use
 as "reserves" to "create" more "credit" to lend.  Current "reserve"
 requirements allow them to use that $1 billion in bonds to "create" as
 much as $15 billion in new "credit" to lend to States, municipalities, to
 individuals and businesses. 

 Added to the original $1 billion, they could have $16 billion of "created
 credit" out in loans paying them interest with their only cost being
 $1,000 for printing the original $1 billion!  Since the U.S. Congress has
 not issued Constitutional money since 1863 (over 100 years), in order
 for the people to have money to carry on trade and commerce they are
 forced to borrow the "created Credit" of the Monopoly bankers and pay 
 them usury-interest!

                          
                         
                         AND THERE'S STILL MORE

   In addition to the vast wealth drawn to them through this almost 
 unlimited usury, the Bankers who control the money at the top are able
 to approve or disapprove large loans to large and successful corporations 
 to the extent that refusal of a loan will bring about a reduction in 
 the price that that Corporation's stock sells for on the market.

 After depressing the price, the Bankers' agents buy large blocks of the
 company's stock, after which the sometimes multi-million dollar loan is
 approved, the stock rises, and is then sold for a profit. In this manner 
 billions of dollars are made with which to buy more stock.  This practice 
 is so refined today that the Federal Reserve Board need only announce to 
 the newspapers an increase or decrease in their "discount rate" to send 
 stocks up and down as they wish.
 
 Using this method since 1913, the Bankers and their agents have purchased
 secret or open control of almost every large corporation in America. Using
 that control, they then force the corporations to borrow huge sums from
 their banks so that corporate earnings are siphoned off in the form of
 interest to the banks.  This leaves little as actual "profits" which can 
 be paid as dividends and explains why stock prices are so depressed,
 while the banks reap billions in interest from corporate loans. In effect, 
 the bankers get almost all of the profits, while individual stockholders 
 are left holding the bag.

   The millions of working families of America are now indebted to the 
 few thousand Banking families for twice the assessed value of the entire
 United States.  And these Banking families obtained that debt against us
 for the cost of paper, ink, and bookkeeping!


                   THE INTEREST AMOUNT IS NEVER CREATED

   The only way new money (which is not true money, but is "credit"
 representing a debt), goes into circulation in America is when it is
 borrowed from Bankers.  When the State and people borrow large sums, we
 seem to prosper.  However, the bankers "create" only the amount of the
 principal of each loan, never the extra amount needed to pay the 
 interest.

 Therefore, the new money never equals the new debt added.  The amounts
 needed to pay the interest on loans is not "created," and therefore does
 not exist!

   Under this kind of a system, where new debt always exceeds the new money 
 no matter how much or how little is borrowed, the total debt increasingly 
 outstrips the amount of money available to pay the debt. The people can 
 never, ever get out of debt!

   An example will show the viciousness of this usury-debt system with 
 its "built in" shortage of money.

                       IF $60,000 IS BORROWED

                       - $255,931.20 MUST BE PAID BACK

   When a citizen goes to a banker to borrow $60,000 to purchase a home or 
 a farm, the Bank clerk has the borrower agree to pay back the loan plus
 interest.  At 14% interest for 30 years, the borrower must agree to pay
 $710.92 per month for a total of $255,931.20. 
                       
 The clerk then requires the citizen to assign to the banker the right of
 ownership of the property if the borrower does not make the required
 payments.  The bank clerk then gives the borrower a $60,000 check or a
 $60,000 deposit slip, crediting the borrower's checking account with
 $60,000.

   The borrower then writes checks to the builder, subcontractors, etc., 
 who in turn write checks.  $60,000 of new "checkbook" money is thereby 
 added to the "money in circulation."

   However, and this is the fatal flaw in a usury system, the only new 
 money created and put into circulation is the amount of the loan, $60,000. 
 The money to pay the interest is NOT created, and therefore was NOT added 
 to "money in circulation."

   Even so, this borrower (and those who follow him in ownership of the
 property) must earn and TAKE OUT OF CIRCULATION $255,931, almost $200,000
 MORE than he put IN CIRCULATION when he borrowed the original $60,000!
 (By the way, it is this interest which cheats all families out of nicer 
 homes.  It is not that they cannot afford them; it is because the Bankers' 
 usury forces them to pay for FOUR homes to get ONE!)

   Every new loan puts the same process in operation. Each borrower adds a
 small sum to the total money supply when he borrows, but the payments on
 the loan (because of interest) then deduct a much LARGER sum from the
 total money supply.

 There is therefore no way all debtors can pay off the money-lenders. As
 they pay the principle and interest, the money in circulation disappears.
 
 All they can do is struggle against each other, borrowing more and more
 from the money-lenders each generation.  The money lenders (Bankers), 
 who produce nothing of value, slowly, then more rapidly, gain a death 
 grip on the land, building, and present and future earnings of the whole 
 working population.  Proverbs 22:7 has come to pass in America.  The 
 borrowers have become the servants to the lenders.  No wonder God
 Almighty forbids interest on loans. (See cover again).

                       SMALL LOANS DO THE SAME THING

   If you haven't quite grasped the impact of the above, let us consider 
 a small auto loan for 3 years at 18% interest. Step 1: Citizen borrows
 $5,000 and pays it into circulation (it goes to the dealer, factory,
 miner, etc.) and signs a note agreeing to pay the Bankers $6,500. Step 2:
 Citizen pays $180 per month of his earnings to the Banker. In three years,
 he will take OUT of circulation $1,500 more than he put IN circulation.

   Every loan of Banker "created" money (credit) causes the same thing to
 happen.  Since this has happened millions of times since 1913 (and
 continues today), you can see why America has gone from a prosperous,
 debt-free nation to a debt-ridden nation where practically every home,
 farm and business is paying usury-tribute to some Banker.
 
 The usury-tribute to the Bankers on personal, local, State and Federal
 debt totals more than the combined earnings of 25% of the working
 people.  Soon it will be 50% and continue upward.

        
              THIS IS WHY BANKERS PROSPER IN GOOD TIMES OR BAD

   In the millions of transactions made each year like those above, little 
 actual currency changes hands, nor is it necessary that it do so.  95% of 
 all "cash" transactions in the U. S. are executed by check, so the 
 Banker is perfectly safe in "creating" that so-called "loan" by writing
 the check or deposit slip, not against actual money, but AGAINST YOUR
 PROMISE TO PAY IT BACK!  The cost to him is paper, ink and a few
 dollars in salaries and office costs for each transaction.  It is "check 
 kiting" on an enormous scale. The profits increase rapidly, year after 
 year, as shown below.

                 THE COST TO YOU?  EVENTUALLY, EVERYTHING!

   In 1910 the U. S. Federal debt was only $1 billion, or $12.40 per 
 citizen.  State and local debts were practically non-existent.

   By 1920, after only six years of Federal Reserve shenanigans, the 
 Federal debt had jumped to $24 billion, or $228 per person, and State
 and local debts were mushrooming.

   By 1981 the Federal debt passed $1 trillion and was growing 
 exponentially as the Bankers tripled the interest rates.  State and local 
 debts are now MORE than the Federal, and with businesses and personal
 debts totalled over $6 trillion, three times the value of all land
 and buildings in America.
   
   If we signed over to the money-lenders of all of America we would 
 still owe them more two more Americas (plus their usury, or course!).

   However, they are too cunning to take the title to everything.  They 
 instead leave you with some "illusion of ownership" so you and your
 children will continue to work and pay the Bankers more of your earnings
 on ever increasing debts.  The "establishment" has captured our people 
 with their ungodly system of usury and debt as certainly as if they had 
 marched in with an uniformed army.

   To understand that it really is a "conquest," go back to the front
 and read the "Three Types of Conquest" again.

   The borrower must pay back MORE then he borrowed, so bankers   
 ALWAYS get more than they lend!

                        
                     FOR THE GAMBLERS AMONG MY READERS

   To grasp the truth that periodic withdrawal or money through interest
 payments will inexorably transfer all wealth in the nation to the receiver
 of interest, imagine yourself in a poker or dice game where everyone must
 buy the chips (the medium of exchange) from a "banker" who does not risk
 chips in the game, but watches the table and every hour reaches in and
 takes 10% to 15% of all the chips on the table.  As the game goes on, the 
 amount of chips in the possession of each player will go up and down with
 his luck.  However, the TOTAL number of chips available to play the game 
 (carry on trade and business) will decrease rapidly.
 
   The game will get low on chips, and some will run out. If they want to 
 continue to play, they must buy or borrow them from the "banker".  The 
 "banker" will sell (lend) them ONLY if the player signs a "mortgage" 
 agreeing to give the "banker" some real property (car, home, farm, 
 business, etc.) if he cannot make periodic payments to pay back all
 the chips plus some EXTRA ones (interest).  The payments must be made on
 time, whether he wins (makes a profit) or not.

                                                                 p. 15

   It is easy to see that no matter how skillfully they play, eventually 
 the "banker" will end up with all of his original chips back, and except 
 for the very best players, the rest, if they stay in long enough, will 
 lose to the "banker" their homes, their farms, their businesses, perhaps 
 even their cars, watches, rings, and the shirts off their backs!

   Our real life situation is MUCH WORSE than any poker game. In a poker 
 game none is forced to go into debt, and anyone can quit at any time and 
 keep whatever he still has.  But in real life, even if we borrow little
 ourselves from the "bankers," the local, State and Federal governments
 borrow billions in our name, squander it, then confiscate our earnings 
 from us and pay it back to the Bankers with interest. 

 We are forced to play the game, and none can leave except by death.  We 
 pay as long as we live, and our children pay after we die.  If we cannot 
 pay, the same government sends the police to take our property and
 give it to the Bankers.  The bankers risk nothing in the game; they just
 collect their percentage and "win it all."  In Las Vegas and at other
 gambling centers, all games are "rigged" to pay the owner a percentage, 
 and they rake in millions...The Federal Reserve Bankers' "game" is also 
 rigged, and it pays off in billions!

   In recent years, Bankers have added real "cards" to their game.
 "Credit" cards are promoted as a convenience and a great boon to trade. 
 Actually, they are ingenious devices by which Bankers collect 2% to 5% 
 of every retail sale from the seller and 18% interest from buyers.  A 
 real "stacked" deck!

p. 16        

                         
                         YES, IT'S POLITICAL, TOO!

   Democrat, Republican, and independent voters who have wondered why
 politicians always spend more tax money than they take in should now see
 the reason.  When they begin to study our "debt-money" system, they soon 
 realize that these politicians are not the agents of the people but are 
 the agents of the Bankers, for whom they plan ways to place the people 
 further in debt. 

 It takes only a little imagination to see that if Congress had been
 "creating," spending and issuing into circulation the necessary increase
 in the money supply, THERE WOULD BE NO NATIONAL DEBT and the over 
 $4 Trillion of other debts would be practically non-existent. 

 Since there would be no ORIGINAL cost of money except printing, and no
 continuing costs such as interest, Federal taxes would be almost nil.
 Money, once in circulation, would remain there and go on serving its
 purpose as a medium of exchange for generation after generation and
 century after century, with no payments to the Bankers whatsoever!

                
                        MOUNTING DEBTS AND WARS

   But instead of peace and debt-free prosperity, we have ever-mounting 
 debt periodic wars.  We as a people are now ruled by a system of
 Banker-owned Mammon that has usurped the mantle of government, disguised
 itself as our legitimate government, and set about to pauperize and
 control our people. 

 It is now a centralized, all-powerful political apparatus whose main
 purposes are promoting war, confiscating the people's money, and
 propagandizing to perpetuate itself in power.  Our two large political 
 parties have become its servants, the various departments of government
 its spending agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service is its 
 collection agency.

   Unknown to the people, it operates in close cooperation with similar
 apparatuses in other nations, which are also disguised as "governments."
 Some, we are told, are friends.  Some, we are told, are enemies.  "Enemies"
 are built up through international manipulations and used to frighten the
 American people into going billions of dollars more into debt to the
 bankers for "military preparedness," "foreign aid to stop communism," 
 "minority rights" etc. 

 Citizens, deliberately confused by brainwashing propaganda, watch
 helplessly while our politicians give food, goods, and money to
 Banker-controlled alien governments under the guise of "better relations"
 and "easing tensions." Our Banker-controlled government takes our finest
 and bravest sons and sends them into foreign wars with obsolete equipment
 and inadequate training, where tens of thousands are murdered, and hundreds 
 of thousands are crippled.  Other thousands are morally corrupted,
 addicted to drugs, and infected with venereal and other diseases, which
 they bring back to the United States.

 When the "war" is over, we have gained nothing, but we are scores of
 billions of dollars more in debt to the bankers, which was the reason for 
 the "war" in the first place!

                           AND THERE'S MORE

    The profits from these massive debts have been used to erect a 
 complete and almost hidden economic and political colossus over our
 nation.  They keep telling us they are trying to do us "good," when in
 truth they work to bring harm and injury to our people.  These would-be
 despots know it is easier to control and rob an ill, poorly-educated
 and confused people than it is a healthy and intelligent population,
 so they deliberately prevent real cures for diseases, they degrade our
 educational systems, and they stir up social and racial unrest.  For the 
 same reason they favor drug use, alcohol, sexual promiscuity, abortion, 
 pornography, and crime.  Everything which debilitates the minds and  
 bodies of the people is secretly encouraged, as it makes the people
 less able to oppose them or even to understand what is being done to
 them.  Family, morals, love of Country, the Christian religion, all
 that is honorable is being swept away, while they try to build their
 new, subservient man.

 Our new "rulers" are trying to change our whole racial, social,
 religious, and political order, but they will not change the debt-
 money economic system by which they ron and rule.  Our people have
 become tenants and "debt-slaves" to the Bankers and their agents in
 the land our fathers conquered.  It is conquest through the most 
 gigantic fraud and swindle in the history of mankind.

 And we need to remind you again: The key to their wealth and power
 over us is their ability to create "money" out of nothing and lend it
 to us at interest.  If they had not been allowed to do that, they
 would never would have gained secret control of our nation.  How true
 Solomon's words are:

           "The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is
            servant to the lender."  Proverbs 22.7

   God Almighty warned in the Bible that one of the curses which would
 come upon His People for disobeying His Laws was:

          "The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee
          very high, and thou shalt come down very low.  He shall
          lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall be
          the head, and thou shalt be the tail."  Deut. 28:44-45

   Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern
 European ancestry and connected with the Rothschild European banks.
 Has that warning come to fruition in America?

   Let us now consider the correct method of providing the medium of
 exchange (money) needed by our people.

         
         THE CONSTITUTIONAL WAY -- EVERY CITIZEN A STOCKHOLDER

   If we would have used the Constitutional way of "creating" the money
 needed in the nation, the Federal Congress would spend most of its time
 and study on the issuance and control of an adequate supply of stable 
 money for the people.

   If an increase of population and production required an increase in
 the medium of exchange, Congress would authorize the "coining," (i.e.,
 printing) of the determined amount.  Some could be used to pay current
 legitimate expenses of the Federal Government, with the balance paid
 directly to the citizens.  Records for payment would be similar to
 Social Security records, except a citizen would be recrded at birth,
 instead of when he first goes to work.  
 
 Each person on the records as of the date of the Congressional 
 authorization would receive an equal amount just as of he were a 
 stockholder holding one share.  Just think -- a peyment of only $20 to 
 each citizen would put $4 billion of debt-free and interest-free money 
 into circulation.

   Such a suggestion always scares the Bankers.  Their propagandists
 will immediately cry "printing press money," abd warn that it would
 soon be "worthless" and would cause "inflation."

   The truth is their immense ursury charges on their "created" credit
 (our debt) is the sole cause of "inflation."  All prices on all
 industry, trade and labor must be reaised periodically to pay the ever
 increasing usury charges.  That is the ONLY cause of higher prices,
 and the money-changers spend millions in propaganda to keep you from
 realizing that.

   The money-creators (Bankers) know that if we ever tried a 
 Constitutional issue of debt-free, interest-free currency, even a 
 limited issue, the benefits would be apparent immediately.  That they
 must prevent.  Abraham Lincoln was the last President to issue such
 debt-free and interest-free currency (in 1863) and he was assassinated
 shortly thereafter. [Transcriber's note: JFK also made an issue of some 
 interest-free U.S. Treasury currency notes in 1963, and he quickly met 
 the same fate as Lincoln].

                           NO BANKS PLUNDER

   Under the Constitutional system, no private banks would exist to rob 
 the people.  Government banks under the control of the people's 
 representatives would issue and control all money and credit.  They would 
 issue not only actual currency, but could lend limited credit at no 
 interest for the purchase of capital goods, such as homes. 

   A $60,000 loan would require only $60,000 repayment, not $255,931 as it 
 is now.  Everyone who supplied materials and labor for the home would get 
 paid just as they do today, but the bankers would NOT get $195,931 in 
 interest.  AND THAT IS WHY THEY RIDCULE AND DESTROY ANYONE SUGGESTING
 GOVERNMENT (CITIZENS') MONEY WITHOUT INTEREST AND WITHOUT DEBT.

   History tells us of debt-free and interest-free money issued by
 governments. The American colonies did it through colonial script in the
 1700's and their wealth soon rivaled that of England and brought 
 restrictions from Parliament, which led to the Revolutionary War. 
 
 Abraham Lincoln did it in 1863 to help finance the Civil War.  He was 
 later assassinated by an agent of the Rothschild Bank.  No debt-free or 
 interest-free money has been issued in America since then.

 Several Arab nations issue interest free loans to their citizens today.
 [Transcribers note: Now you can understand what all the commotion in the 
 Middle East is all about, and why the banker-owned press is brainwashing 
 American citizens to think of all Arabs as terrorists). 

 The Saracen Empire forbade interest on money 1,000 years ago and its 
 wealth outshone even Saxon Europe.  Mandarin China issued its own money, 
 interest-free and debt-free and historians and collectors of art today
 consider those centuries to be China's time of greatest wealth, culture,
 and peace.

   Germany issued debt-free and interest-free money from 1935 on, 
 accounting for its startling rise from the depression to a world power
 in 5 years.  Germany fiunanced its entire government and war operation
 from 1935 to 1945 without gold and without debt, and it took the
 whole Capitalist and Communist world to destroy the German power over 
 Europe and bring Europe back under the heel of the bankers.  Such
 history of money does not even appear in the textbooks of public
 (government) schools today.
                            
   Issuing money which does not have to be paid back in interest leaves 
 the money available to use in the exchange of goods and services and 
 services, and its only continuing cost is replacement as the paper wears 
 out.  Money is the paper ticket by which transfers are made and should 
 always be in sufficient quantity to transfer all possible production of 
 the nation to the ultimate consumers.

   It is as ridiculous for a nation to say to its citizens, "You must 
 consume less because we are short of money," as it would be for an
 airline to say, "Our planes are flying, but we cannot take you because 
 we are short of tickets."

                            
                             STABLE  MONEY

   Money, issued in such a way, would derive its value in exchange from 
 the fact that it had come from the highest legal source in the nation 
 and would be declared legal to pay all public and private debts. 

 Issued by a sovereign nation, not in danger of collapse, it would need 
 no gold or silver or other so-called "precious" metals to back it. 
 
 As history shows, the stability and responsibility of government issuing
 it is the deciding factor in the acceptance of that government's
 currency -- not gold, silver, or iron buried in some hole in the ground.
 Proof is America's currency today.  Our gold and silver are practically
 gone, but our currency is accepted.  But if the government was about to
 collapse our currency would be worthless. 

 Also, money issued through the people's legitimate government would not
 be under the control of a privately owned corporation whose individual
 owners benefit by causing the mojney amount and value to fluctuate and
 the people to go into debt.

   Under the present debt-usury system, the extra burden of usury forces 
 workers and businesses to demand more money for the work and goods to 
 pay their ever-increasing debts and taxes.  This increase in prices and 
 wages is called "inflation."  Bankers, politicians and "economists" 
 blame it on everything but the real cause, which is the usury levied on 
 money and debt by the Bankers. 

   This "inflation" benefits the money-lenders, since it wipes out savings 
 of one generation so they can not finance or help the next generation, 
 who must then borrow from the money-lenders, and pay a large part of 
 their life's labor to the usurer.

   With an adequate supply of interest-free money, little borrowing would 
 be required and prices would be established by people and goods, not by 
 debts and usury.

                             CITIZEN CONTROL

  If Federal Congress failed to act, or acted wrongly, in the supply of 
 money, the citizens would use the ballot or recall petitions to replace 
 those who prevented correct action with others whom the people believe 
 would pursue a better money policy.  Since the creation of money and its 
 issuance in sufficient quantity would be one of the few functions of 
 Congress, the voter could decide on a candidate by his stand on money 
 instead of the hundreds of lesser issues which are presented to us 
 today.   
 
 And since money is, and would remain, a national function, local
 differences or local factrions would not be able to sway the people from
 the nation's (citizens') interest.  All other problems, except the 
 nation's defense, would be taken care of in the State, County, or City 
 governments where they are best handled and most easily corrected.

   An adequate national defense would be provided by the same citizen-
 controlled Congress, and there would be no Bankers behind the scenes,
 bribing politicians to give $220 billions of American military 
 equipment to other nations, disarming us, while alien nations prepare
 to attack and invade the United States of America.

                         A DEBT-FREE AMERICA
                                                                 
   With debt-free and interest-free money, there would be no high and
 confiscatory taxation, and our homes would be mortgage-free with no
 $10,000-per-year payments to the Bankers, nor would they get $1,000 to
 $2,500 per year from every automobile on our roads. 

 We would need no "easy payment" plans, "revolving" charge accounts, 
 loans to pay medical or hospital bills, loans to pay taxes, loans to pay 
 for burials, loans to pay loans, nor any of the thousand and one 
 usury-bearing loans which now suck the life-blood of American families. 

 There would be no unemployment, divorces caused by debt, destitute old      
 people, or mounting crime, and even the so-called "depraved" classes
 would be deprived of neither job nor money to buy the necessities of
 life.

    Criminals could not become politicians, nor would politicians become
 criminals in the pay of the Money-lenders.  Our officials, at all
 government levels, would be working for the people instead of devising 
 more money to place us further in debt to the Bankers.

 We would get out of the entangling foreign alliances that have engulfed
 us in four major ways and scores of minor wars since the Federal Reserve
 Act was passed, alliances which are now used to prevent America from
 preparing her own defense in the face of mounting danger from alien 
 powers.

    A debt-free America would mean mothers would not have to work.
 With mothers at home, juvenile deliquency would decrease rapidly.  The
 elimination of the usury and debt would be the equivalent of a 50% 
 raise in the purchasing power of every worker.  With this cancellation 
 of all debts, the return to the people of all the property and wealth 
 the parasitic Bankers and their quasi-legal agents have stolen by usury
 and fraud, and then ending of their theft of $300 Billion (or more)
 every year from the people.  America would be prosperous and powerful
 beyond the wildest dreams of the citizens today.  And we would be at
 peace!  (For a Bible example of cancellation of debts to money lenders
 and restoration of property and money to the people, read 
 Nehemiah 5:1-13.)
 
                       
                        WHY YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN

   We realize that this small, and necessarily incomplete, article on 
 money may be charged with oversimplification.  Some may say that if it 
 is that simple the people would have known about it, and it could not 
 have happened.  

 But this MONEY LENDERS consPIRACY is as old as Babylon, and even in 
 America it dates far back before the year 1913. 

 Actually, 1913 may be considered the year in which their previous plans
 came to fruition, and the way opened for complete economic conquest of 
 our people. The consPIRACY is old enough in America so that to its 
 agents have been, for many years, in positions of influence such as 
 newspaper publishers, editors, columnists, church ministers, university 
 presidents, professors, textbook writers, labor union leaders, movie
 makers, radio and TV commentators, politicians, and from school board 
 members to U.S. presidents, and many others.

                        
                    CONTROLLED NEWS AND INFORMATION

   These agents control the information available to our people. They
 manipulate public opinion, elect whom they will locally and nationally, 
 and never expose the crooked money system.  They promote school bonds, 
 municipal bonds, expensive and detrimental farm programs, "urban renewal," 
 foreign aid, and many other schemes which put the people more deeply 
 into debt to the Bankers.

                                                                p. 26
 
 Thoughtful citizens wonder why billions are spent on one program and
 billions on another which may duplicate it or even nullify it, such as
 paying some farmers not to raise crops, while at the same time building
 dams or canals to irrigate more farm land. Crazy or stupid? 

 Neither.  The goal is more debt.  Thousands of government-sponsored 
 ways of wasting money go on continually.  Most make no sense, but they 
 are never exposed for what they really are, builders of "billions for 
 the bankers and debts for the people."

   So-called "economic experts" write syndicated columns in hundreds of
 newspapers, craftily designed to prevent the people from learning the
 simple truth about our money system.  Commentators on radio and TV, 
 preachers, educators, and politicians blame the people as wasteful, lazy
 or spend-thrift, and blame the workers and consumers for the increase 
 in debts and the inflation of prices, when they know the cause is the 
 debt-money system itself. 

 Our people are literally drowned in charges and counter-charges designed
 to confuse them and keep them from understanding the unconstitutional and
 evil money-system that is so efficiently and silently robbing the farmers,
 the workers, and the businessmen of the fruits of their labor and of their
 freedoms.

   When some few Patriotic people or organizations who know the truth 
 begin to expose them or try to stop any of their mad schemes, they are
 ridiculed and smeared as "right-wing extremists," "super-patriots,"
 "ultra-rightists," "bigots," "fascists," and "anti-Semites."  Any name
 is used which will cause them to shut up or will at least stop other
 people from listening to the warning they are giving.  Articles and
 books such as you are now reading are kept out of schools, libraries,
 and book stores.

    Some, who are especially vocal in their exposure of the treason 
 against our people, are harassed by government agencies such as
 the EPA, the OSHA, the IRS, and others, causing them financial loss
 and bankruptcy.  Using the above methods, they have been completely
 successful in preventing most Americans from learning the truth.

 Therefore, to prevent violence or armed resistance to their plunder of
 America, they plan to register all firearms and eventually to disarm
 all citizens.  They have to eliminate most guns, except those in the
 hands of their government, polics and army.

                        
                           TELL THE PEOPLE

   The "almost hidden" conspirators in politics, religion, education,
 entertainment, and the news media are working for A Banker-owned 
 United States, in a Banker-owned world under a Banker-owned World 
 Government!

   Love of Country, compassion for your race, and concern for your
 children should make you deeply interested in this, America's greatest
 problem, for our generation has not suffered under the "yoke" as the
 coming generations will.  Usury and taxes will continue to take a 
 larger and larger part of the annual earning of the people and put 
 them into the pockets of the Bankers and their political Agents. 
 Increasing "government" regulations will prevent citizen protest and 
 opposition to their control.

   It is possible that your grandchildren will own neither home nor car, 
 but will live in "government-owned" apartments and ride to work in 
 "government-owned" buses (both paying interest to the bankers), 
 AND BE ALLOWED TO KEEP JUST ENOUGH OF THEIR EARNINGS TO BUY A MINIMUM 
 OF FOOD AND CLOTHING while in luxury?  In Asia and eastern Europe it is 
 called "communism;" in America it is called "Democracy" and "Capitalism."

   America will not shake off her Banker-controlled dictatorship as long 
 as the people are ignorant of the hidden controllers.  International  
 financiers, who control most of the governments of the nations, and most
 sources of information, seem to have us completely within their grasp. 
 
 They are afraid of only one thing: an awakened Patriotic Citizenry, armed 
 with the truth, and with a trust in Almighty God for deliverance.  This 
 pamphlet has given you the truth about their iniquitous system.  What you
 do with it is in your hands, as in the hands of Divine Providence.  "The
 fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord
 shall be safe."  Proverbs 29:25

                    AUDIT THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM?
 
    The Federal Reserve has never been audited by the government since 
 it took over our money and credit in 1913.  In 1975, a bill, H.R. 4316,
 to require an audit, was introduced in Congress.

    During the April, 1975, hearings, this author submitted a statement
 favoring the audit, as did many others.  It is reprinted on the next
 two pages, from pages 306-308 of the 739 pages of testimony given
 during those hearings before the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary
 Policy of the Committee on Banking, Currency, and Housing,  House of
 Representatives.  Due to pressure from the money-controllers, it was
 not passed.  No audit has ever been made.

                        NOTEABLE MONEY QUOTES

 PRESIDENT JAMES A. GARFIELD: "whoever controls the volume of money in
   in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce."

 HORACE GREELRY:  "While boasting of our noble deeds, we are careful to
   conceal the ugly fact that by an iniquitous money system we have
   nationalized a system of oppression which, though more refined, is
   not less cruel than the old system of chattel slavery."

 THOMAS A. EDISON:  "People who will not turn a shovel full of dirt on
   project (Muscle Shoals Dam) nor contribute a pound of material, will
   collect more money from the United States than will the People who
   supply all the material and do all the work.   This is the terrible
   thing about interest...But here is the point:  If the Nation can
   issue a dollar bond it can issue a dollar bill.  The element that
   makes the bond good makes the bill good also.  
   
   The difference between the bond and the bill is that the bond lets 
   the money broker collect twice the amount of the bond an an additional
   20%.  Whereas the currency, the honest sort provided by the
   Constitution, pays nobody but those who contribute in some useful way. 

   It is absurd to say our Country can issue bonds and cannot issue
   currency.  Both are promises to pay, but one fattens the usurer and
   the other helps the People.  If the currency issued by the People
   were no good, then the bonds would be no good, either.  It is a
   terrible situation when the Government, to insure the National
   Wealth, must go in debt and submit to ruinous interest charges at
   the hands of men who cointrol the fictitious value of gold.  Interest
   is the invention of Satan."

 PRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON:  "A great industrial Nation is controlled
   by its system of credit.  Our system of credit is concentrated.  The
   growth of the Nation and all our activities are in the hands of a few 
   men.  We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most
   completely controlled and dominated Governments in the world -- no 
   longer a Government of free opinion, no longer a Government by 
   conviction and vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion 
   and duress of small groups of dominant men."
   
   (Just before he died, Wilson is reported to have stated to friends
   that he had been "deceived" and that "I have betrayed my Country."
   He referred to the Federal Reserve Act, passed during his 
   Presidency) [<--note by the author, Emry.] 
   
 SIR JOSIAH STAMP: (President of the Bank of England in the 1920's, the
   second richest man in Britain):  "Banking was conceived in iniquity
   and was born in sin.  The Bankers own the earth.  Take it away from
   them, but leave them the power to create deposits, and with the flick 
   of the pen they create enough deposits to buy it back again.  However,
   take it away from them, and all the great fortunes like mine will
   disappear, and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier
   and better world to live in.  But, if you wish to remain the slaves
   of the Bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them
   continue to create deposits."

 MAJOR L.L.B. ANGAS: "The modern Banking system manufactures money out
   of nothing.  The process is perhaps the most astounding piece of
   sleight of hand that was ever invented.  Banks can in fact inflate,
   mint, and unmint the modern ledger-emntry currency."

 RALPH M. HAWTREY (Former Secretary of the British Treasury): "Banks
   lend by creating credit.  They create the means of payment out of 
   nothing."

 ROBERT H. HEMPHILL (Credit Manager of Federal Reserve Bank, Altanta, 
   Ga.):  "This is a staggering thought.  We are completely dependent 
   on the the commercial Banks.  Someone has to borrow every dollar we 
   have in circulation, cash or credit.  If the Banks create ample 
   synthetic money, we are prosperous; if not, we starve.  We are
   absolutely without a permanent money system.  When one gets a
   complete grasp of the picture, the tragic absurdity of our
   hopeless position is almost incredible, but there it is.  It is
   the most important subject intelligent persons can investigate and
   reflect upon.  It is so important that our present civilization may
   collapse unless it becomes widely understood and the defects
   remedied very soon."

 CONGRESSMEN LOUIS T. MCFADDEN:  The Federal Reserve (Banks) are one
   of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever seen.  There is
   not a man within the sound of my voice who does not know that this
   Nation is run by the International Bankers."

 JOHN C. CALHOUN (Speech in the Senate, May 26, 1836):  "A power has
   risen up in the government greater than the people themselves,
   consisting of many and various powerful interests combined in one mass, 
   and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the 
   banks."

 LYOF N. TOLSTOY (In What Shall We Do?, 1891):  "Money is a new form
   of slavery, and sistinguishable from the old simply by the fact that
   it is impersonal -- that there is no human relation between master
   and slave."

 THOMAS JEFFERSON (Letter to Elbridge Gerry, Jan. 26, 1779): "Banking
   establishments are more dangerous than standing armies."

 WILLIAM CORBETT: (In Advice to Yound Men, 1, 1829):  "The power
   which money gives is that of brute force;  It is the power of
   the bludgeon and the bayonet."

 SOPHOCLES (Atigone, c. 450 B.C.):  "Money lays waste cities;  It sets 
   men to roaming from home. It seduces and corrupts honest men and
   turns virtue to baseness; It teaches villany and impiety."

   YOUR MINSTER?

   ANYONE?

   By the 1980's virtually no prominent indiviual or national organization
 of influence in America, including religious organizations, opposes or
 exposes the Bankers' plunder.  Because of that silence most Americans
 live out their whole lives in this land without ever learning how they are 
 being robbed.

   Small groups of patriots are opposing the Bankers.  One is LIBERTY
 LOBBY which publishes The SPOTLIGHT, a weekly newspaper ($32 per year 
 or $59 for two years, 300 Independence Ave., S.E., Washington, D.C.
 20003).  Each issue exposes the anti-American shenanigans of the
 Bankers, Communists and other enemies of America.  Every patriotic
 American family should subscribe.

   Read this short booklet over again.

   Since the politicians, the major media and the churches will not
 warn the people, that warning is up to us AND YOU!  Will you pray
 AND ACT?

              
              
              IS IT POSSIBLE GOD KNOWS ABOUT OUR PLIGHT?
             
              "But this is a people robbed and spoiled;
               they are all of them snared in holes,
               and they are bid in prison houses;
               they are for a prey, and none delivereth;
               for a spoil, AND NONE SAVETH, RESTORE.

               "Who among you will give ear to this?
                Who will hearken, and hear for the time
                to come?" (the "last days") Isaiah 42:22-23

                           WHAT YOU CAN DO

    Pray for America's release from this wicked money control, which
 is at the root of our debts and wars.

    Send copies of this book to officials in your State government, 
 to school board members, principals, teachers, ministers, neighbors,
 etc.  Ask them for their comments.

    Write letters to elected or appointed officials.  Write "letters-
 to-the-editor" to newspapers.  Most small towns and suburban newspapers
 are not totally controlled, while most of the big city newspapers are.

    Give or mail them out by the hundreds to awaken and educate other
 Americans to this fantastic plunder of the working people of America.
 The cost to you is VERY LITTLE compared to the BILLIONS in money and
 property being STOLEN from our people.

    The Bibe has scores of passages condemning the robbery of the
 workers and the poor by the wicked.  For a Bible-related study of
 this evil system of plunder, write to the publisher of this booklet for
 a list of books, tracts, and cassette sermons on Bible Law and Prophecy.
