ROSS PEROT AT VALLEY FORGE
==========================
 
[CN:  Here is (roughly) what Ross  Perot had to say on August 18,
1996, at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.]
 
The pioneers.  They headed west.  They circled the wagons.   Then
they hunted the food.
 
Are  we  little  sheep who are lost in the woods, but we would be
good, if we had someone to watch over us?
 
You see? It all fits together like pieces in a puzzle.
 
Does it make a profit? No.
Does it lose money? Yes.
How much money does it have in the bank? None.
 
Look at this slide, and you will see it's a trick.
 
Since 1980, the standard of  living has gone down.  Two paychecks
today are worth a single paycheck 25 years ago.
 
(You say, "Well Ross, where'd you get those numbers?")
 
$52 billion cumulative trade deficit, and growing like a weed.
 
16 people that worked for every person retired.  Now, 3.2  people
for  every  person  retired.  The year 2010, two people for every
person retired. (I hope they live forever.)
 
First define the problem.  Look  at  history:  67 cents a year; a
dollar a year; $6.75 a year; $29 per year.   And  strap  on  your
seatbelt: today it's $5,007 a year.
 
(We'll  use  our  computers  as a wind tunnel.  We'll nail it and
give it to you.)
 
You come to me and say,  "Ross.  I'm hopelessly in debt.  I can't
pay my bills." I'd say, "Well, let's change the subject."
 
Again: step one is to define the problem.
 
Billions of cells before the baby is born.  If  you  blindfold  a
baby  for  6 months, it stays blind.  Six-year-old's brain weighs
50 percent of adult weight.   Brain  grows to 90 percent of adult
weight. Then it shuts down the circuits.
 
Isn't this fascinating?
 
Light these candles.  You are  the  wind.   The  Spirit  of  '76.
Think of the Liberty Bell. Think of the Star Spangled Banner.

Aperi os tuum muto, et causis omnium filiorum qui pertranseunt.
Aperi os tuum, decerne quod justum est, et judica inopem et 
  pauperem.                    -- Liber Proverbiorum  XXXI: 8-9
