THE PARTIN REPORT
=================
[CN: I received the following from a reader. *caveat emptor.*]

Brian,

Representative Key's video "Oklahoma City:  What Really Happened," is an
important service to the lay public, in that it is a conscientious and
provocative summary of the various challenges to the official government
version of what is known about the bombing of the Murrah building. 

However, it is now over a year old.  It needs updating.

The Partin report, a detailed statement from General Partin on the 
positions he takes at the very brief excerpt from his Oklahoma City 
press conference, is the only document available, official or 
non-official, which attempts to provide a scientific explanation of the 
ballistical evidence found in the building itself.  It is also now over a 
year old.  

It needs updating.

It is surprising to me that there have been no rebuttals to the evidence 
in the Partin report by experts with the competence and the inclination 
to disagree with it.

Does this prove that the assertions in the Partin report must therefore 
be correct?

Probably not.  There are many other reasons why the physical evidence
surviving the bombing, as observable in photographs, has not been analyzed
and discussed to anywhere near the same extent that would be routine for
the crash of any airliner. 

The biggest reason is probably that people just don't want to talk about
it.  I don't know why, but they don't.  This includes lots and lots of
otherwise reasonable people who seemingly have no agenda or obvious reason
to cling to the official line.  Tell them you know of a report that
suggests that internal charges planted on the building's structural
supports contributed significantly to the explosive damage caused to the
structure, and they hotly deny that such a thing could be possible.  The
very idea is so ridiculous to them that offered the opportunity, they
refuse to read the report, claiming lack of time, lack of knowledge of the
source, or lack of competence to judge.  I could go on and on.  The
mainstream press doesn't want to cover it, obviously.  Is this because
they are in bed with the government?  Well, they ARE in bed with the
government, but they would be equally justified in ignoring the subject
because there is no readership for it.  

This refusal to consider is not a conspiracy, it is a social mind-set, and
a very unfortunate one. 

In any case, as long as you're giving out information about how to access
ancient information, might as well mention that a copy of the Partin
report for can be obtained from the general himself for $10 (or at least
this was possible a few months ago, I haven't checked with him lately). 
This report needs more discussion, further amplification, and a few solid
critiques from disinterested experts with the public interest at heart. 

General Partin's address:

Benton K. Partin
8908 Captains Row
Alexandria Virginia 22308
703-80-7652

I do not have any connection with the general, but I do own a copy of his 
report, which has this information on the cover.
