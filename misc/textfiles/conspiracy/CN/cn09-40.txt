GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]
 
[...continued...]
 
It's worth noting here  because,  upon leave from Chestnut Lodge,
Phil Graham blew his own brains out, in August of 1963.
 
Reading again from *Katherine the Great*:
 
  Death preoccupied Phil all that Spring.  Three times,  with
  permission  to  leave  Chestnut  Lodge,  he  visited Edward
  Bennett Williams to re-write  his  will, each time reducing
  Katherine's share of his estate.  On the second  visit,  he
  demanded  that Williams burn the first will.  On the third,
  he had him  burn  the  second.   These  wills rescinded and
  superseded  the   carefully   thought   out   document   of
  longstanding,   one  that  provided  trust  funds  for  his
  children and gave  the  bulk  of  his  estate  to his wife.
  After  he  died,   during   probate,   Katherine's   lawyer
  challenged  the  legality  of  the  last will.  The probate
  proceeding  enabled  Katherine  to   take  control  of  the
  [Washington]  Post  with  no  significant  legal   problem.
  Although  with  the  discredited  will  not  on  the public
  record, it is not known  who  Phil might have designated in
  her place.
 
  Manic-depressives  frequently  plan  their  deaths  on  the
  anniversary of a significant event.  Saturday, August  3rd,
  1963,  was  the  15th  anniversary  of the formation of the
  Washington Post Company,  the  umbrella corporation for the
  Post and other property in which Katherine and Phil  Graham
  were  sole  partners.   On  the morning of August 3rd, Phil
  telephoned Katherine from Chestnut  Lodge  and said that he
  was feeling much better.  He asked if he  could  spend  the
  weekend  with  her  on  their  farm.   Katherine called Joe
  Rowe(sp?) and  told  him  happily,  "Phil  is better!  He's
  coming home.  Why don't  you  come  over  and  see  him  on
  Tuesday?"
 
  On  Monday  he  would spend the day with the children.  She
  picked him up at  Chestnut  Lodge that morning.  They drove
  to a small Virginia town called Warrenton, in  Fochier(sp?)
  County,  42  miles southwest of Washington, in the Virginia
  Hunt country.  The  farm,  Glen  Welby(sp?),  was that of a
  gentleman  and weekend hunter, equipped with television and
  telephones, books and paintings,  shotguns for hunting deer
  and rifles for quail hunting parties, horses,  servants,  a
  large,  well-stocked  kitchen  and bar.  Katherine and Phil
  spent some time together,  and  then  Katherine took a nap.
  Phil went downstairs, sat on the edge of the  bathtub,  and
  shot himself in the head.
 
Again, he may very well have been disturbed here.  However one of
the  x-factors that's missing here from Debra Davis's ruminations
on  the  death  of  Phil   Graham   is  his  long  standing  with
intelligence and, in turn, the longstanding, ongoing, and  highly
successful  attempts  by  the  CIA  to  institute  mind  control,
including training mind-control assassins and consequently (as we
looked  at  in  our Radio Free America series on mind control) to
get some  of  those  assassins  (or  apparent assassins:  they're
often used as decoys) to commit suicide.  So whether or  not  the
death  of  Phillip  Graham here, who had become disenchanted with
the pattern of CIA co-operation  with  the media, had anything at
all to do with CIA mind control, remains to be seen.  As we  like
to   say  here,  "Food  for  thought,  and  grounds  for  further
research."  It is worth  noting,  though, that this happened just
about 3 months before the  assassination  of  President  Kennedy.
It's  also  worth  noting that Phillip Graham's discredited wills
*might* have invested the Washington  Post (at least to a certain
extent) away from the CIA which had been so inextricably involved
with it from the very beginning.
 
And of course, one of  the  main  names  to  take note of here --
again, by way of noting how the Washington Post really is part of
a sort of old intelligence, old boy network here -- is  the  name
of  Edward Bennett Williams, the owner of the Washington Redskins
for  awhile,  and  now  the  Baltimore  Orioles.   Edward Bennett
Williams is one of the prime, intelligence-related  attorneys  in
the  United  States.  His clients not only include Richard Helms,
whose association  with  Ben  Bradlee  we  looked  at  awhile ago
(Helms, of course, CIA Director; CIA Director at the time of  the
overthrow of the Allende government, worked with Henry Kissinger,
[Gloria] Steinem's old  [boyfriend],  among  others.)  But Edward
Bennett Williams has  represented  John  Connally,  Jimmy  Hoffa,
Robert  Vesco.  And interestingly enough, it was while working as
an investigator  for  Edward  Bennett  Williams's  law firm, that
Robert Maheu,  formerly  of  the  [Howard]  Hughes  organization,
helped  set up the organized crime assassination teams which were
allegedly  to be used against Castro, but there's some indication
that they were used against John Kennedy instead.  [CN:  See, for
example, "Alpha-66," CN  8.43]  Again,  documentation on that, on
"Guns of November," program #1, the first of our  4  programs  on
the assassination of John Kennedy.
 
It's  worth  noting  here  now too, that surrounding the death of
John Kennedy, we  have  an  interesting  situation that, not only
does Phillip Graham "bow out" in sort of a  grisly  fashion,  but
also  *after*  John  Kennedy was killed, in October of 1964, Mary
Meyer, the  ex-wife  of  Cord  Meyer,  the  brother-in-law of Ben
Bradlee (who himself had intelligence connections) -- Cord Meyer,
a  key  CIA  counter-intelligence  official  --  Mary  Meyer  was
murdered, her diary then appropriated by CIA counter-intelligence
chief James Angleton.
 
Reading again from *Katherine the Great*:
 
  Ben  Bradlee  was  considered  by  some  members   of   the
  Washington   press   to   be   insensitive   and  ruthless,
  professionally  and  socially.   He  was  indiscrete  about
  having been on intimate  terms  with Kennedy, one aspect of
  which was that his sister-in-law, Mary Pinchot  Meyer,  who
  had lived in Bradlee's renovated garage, had been Kennedy's
  lover.   Mary  Meyer  had been murdered in October of 1964.
  She was killed  near  her  house,  or  by  the C&O Canal in
  Georgetown, shot or stabbed.  The location, even the manner
  of her death, varies with each account.  Immediately  after
  she    died,   James   Angleton,   the   CIA's   Chief   of
  Counter-Intelligence, searched  her  apartment  for a diary
  she had kept about Kennedy and took it to CIA headquarters.
  Supposedly to burn it, although because of his training  he
  never  destroyed  any document.  A year later, when Bradlee
  went  to  the  [Washington]  Post,  the  slaying  was still
  unsolved.   (It  has  never  been  solved.    Bradlee   was
  uncharacteristically silent about it.)
 
So  the  point  here again is, right around the time John Kennedy
was leaving this world,  a  lot  of  the  people within the whole
Washington Post  axis  (and  again,  I  use  that  term  ["axis"]
advisedly)  were  also  "bowing  out"  in  grisly  fashion:  Phil
Graham, and the late,  unfortunate,  Mary  Pinchot Meyer, being a
couple of them here.
 
Now the last two details that we're gonna look at here are, in  a
sense,  a  sort  of  an  abbreviated  look at the Washington Post
involvement with CIA  in  the  Watergate  case.   Now  one of the
aspects of Watergate that has not received  enough  publicity  is
the fact that it appears almost probable that the CIA, as well as
other  elements  of  the  National Security establishment, wanted
Richard Nixon out for  a  reason  or reasons which are debatable.
Debra Davis here gives some reasons; we're gonna entertain those.
I'm gonna suggest a couple of others here in a couple of minutes.
 
Now we could go  into  the  indications  of  CIA  involvement  in
Watergate  all day.  Unfortunately, due to time limitations here,
we're not gonna be able to  do  it.  Suffice it to say that James
McCord, who was a very high-ranking intelligence  official,  head
of  the  security  organization for the Committee to Re-Elect the
President, led the Watergate  burglars  into the Watergate Hotel.
Now one of the things that McCord did is, after placing  a  piece
of  tape  on  the  door  to  alert  him  as to whether or not the
"Plumbers'" presence had been discovered in the Watergate -- when
he discovered  that  tape  missing,  he  then  replaced  the tape
*without* notifying the other Plumbers.  For a  man  of  McCord's
very   longstanding   and   sophisticated  involvement  with  the
intelligence community, that is frankly  incredible, if one is to
accept that James McCord was not a double agent placed within the
Plumbers organization to get rid of Richard Nixon  on  behalf  of
CIA  and  others.   That is the general view of most researchers,
simply because as soon as McCord  saw that tape missing he has to
have known  that  their  presence  in  the  Watergate  Hotel  was
discovered.   There's no other conclusion.  He placed the tape to
alert him to a discovery.  When he saw it was missing -- not just
knocked off, but  missing  --  he  has  to  have known that their
presence was discovered.  Despite  that,  he  replaced  the  tape
again;  didn't  alert  the other Plumbers.  And when the security
guard at the  Watergate  Hotel  saw  that  the  tape was replaced
again,  he  notified  authorities.   Because  obviously  he  knew
someone was in there.  So again, that's  just  one  of  the  many
indicators that, in fact, Nixon's Plumbers unit was deep-sixed by
CIA from the inside.  The motives for doing so remain a matter of
debate.
