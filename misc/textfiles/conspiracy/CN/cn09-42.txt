GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]

Now obviously, people are  aware  of  the  role of the Washington
Post, Woodward and  Bernstein  in  particular,  in  breaking  the
Watergate  case.  It appears that Woodward and Bernstein, through
Katherine Graham the publisher  and Ben Bradlee, were manipulated
by CIA  --  and  specifically,  Richard  Ober,  an  associate  of
Bradlee's  and  himself  a key CIA counter-intelligence official,
along with Cord  Meyer,  Bradlee's  brother-in-law.  Richard Ober
was indeed the "Deep Throat" who alerted Woodward and  Bernstein.
Interestingly  enough,  Richard  Ober was also head of "Operation
Chaos,"  a  CIA  domestic  counter-intelligence  operation  which
involved setting up provocations  as well as infiltrating radical
groups.
 
Of the Washington Post's role in removing Richard  Nixon  and  in
the  Watergate  case, Debra Davis writes as follows.  (You'll see
some references here to the  book,  *All The President's Men*, by
Woodward and Bernstein.)
 
  Watergate   was,   according   to    this    scenario,    a
  counter-intelligence  operation   of   the  highest  order,
  carried out for patriotic as well as  bureaucratic  reasons
  which were, in the minds of the intelligence directors, one
  and  the  same.   It  is clear what their motives must have
  been.   Kissinger  was  pursuing  a  disastrous  policy  in
  Cambodia, disregarding the CIA's advice and blaming the CIA
  when he failed -- all the  time adding fuel to the anti-war
  movement.   Nixon's  harsh  and  stupid  attempts  to  "get
  political control over the CIA," as Watergate burglar James
  McCord later  told  the  Senate  Watergate  Committee,  his
  intention to have the Agency's judgements conform to rather
  than  inform  his policies, "smacked of the situation which
  Hitler's intelligence  chiefs  found  themselves in" before
  the fall of Germany.  But primarily because Nixon seemed at
  times to be insane, a terrible  and  a  dangerous  head  of
  state,  double-agent  Ober,  by  this  logic,  arranged for
  double-agent McCord  to  be  arrested  during the Watergate
  break-in.  And then Richard Ober,  the  head  of  Operation
  Chaos, the only man in the nation with access to classified
  information  at  the White House, the FBI, the CIA, and CRP
  [Committee to Re-Elect the  President], became Deep Throat,
  a favor to Ben Bradlee, an old Harvard chum.  Ober's  boss,
  James  Angleton,  finally  had  achieved the ultimate dirty
  trick.   Bradlee  would  take  all  the  risks,  and either
  Bradlee would succeed in getting rid of Nixon, or Katherine
  Graham would have to salvage her newspaper by  getting  rid
  of Bradlee.
 
That,   basically,   is   the   view   of   Richard   Ober,   the
counter-intelligence  official  of  CIA.  The further information
that Richard Ober was, in fact, Deep Throat, and that the CIA and
Washington Post were involved in removing Nixon, is added here by
Debra Davis.  (It doesn't  really  matter  the  order here, but I
read that a little out of order.)
 
But again, reading more about the use of Washington Post  by  CIA
and  CIA counter-intelligence to remove Nixon, Debra Davis writes
as follows.
 
  The minor deception in the book is that only Woodward  knew
  who Deep Throat was.
 
(That book, of course: *All The President's Men*.)
 
  Bradlee  knew  him; had known him for longer than Woodward.
  There is a  possibility  that  Woodward  had  met him while
  working as an intelligence liaison between the Pentagon and
  the White House, where Deep Throat spent a lot of time, and
  that he considered Woodward trustworthy or useful and began
  talking to him when the time  was  right.   It  is  equally
  likely,  though, that Bradlee, who had given Woodward other
  sources  on  other  stories,   put   them  in  touch  after
  Woodward's first day on the story, when  Watergate  burglar
  James  McCord  said  at his arraignment hearing that he had
  once worked for the  CIA.   Whether or not Bradlee provided
  the source, he recognized McCord's statement to  the  court
  as  highly  unusual.   CIA  employees,  when  caught  in an
  illegal act, do not admit that they work for the CIA unless
  that is part of the  plan.   McCord  had no good reasons to
  mention the CIA at all, except apparently  to  direct  wide
  attention  to  the  burglary,  because he had been asked to
  state only his present occupation and he had not worked for
  the CIA for several years.
 
(I think that  last  statement  is  open  to question.  That last
statement of Debra Davis is open to question.)
 
  What matters is not how the connection with Deep Throat was
  made, but why.  Why did Bradlee allow Woodward to  rely  so
  heavily  upon  it?   And ultimately, why did the leaders of
  the intelligence  community,  for  whom  Deep Throat spoke,
  want the President of the United States to fall?
 
All of that, really, highlights the ongoing  association  of  not
only  the Washington Post, but Katherine Graham, a key partner in
the Ms. [magazine] axis, in working with CIA.
 
Now one scenario that  is  not  discussed by Debra Davis concerns
the possibility that Richard Nixon was not only  removed  because
he  was  a  dangerous  leader, but there are a lot of indications
that he was removed, basically, because the military and the "far
right" were upset with his policies of detente towards the Soviet
Union and China.  The China lobby in particular (and we've looked
at that in great detail in Radio Free America shows #11, #14, and
#15, the second  of  our  "Aryan  Nations"  programs  and our two
"Anti-Communist League" programs), the China lobby is a  dominant
and  extremely reactionary force in American politics.  Nixon was
very  close  to  them  and  many  researchers  feel  (and there's
indications that they felt betrayed by Richard Nixon)  that  they
wanted  a  harder  "Cold  Warrior" than Nixon turned out to be --
even though he was  a  lifelong  anti-Communist  -- and that as a
result they had him removed.  That's another interpretation  that
many researchers have.
 
I  also  think...  (I think that is correct.)  I also think, to a
certain extent, Debra Davis's  analysis  is correct.  In a sense,
Nixon wanted to become larger than the system.  As  of  11/22/63,
the  intelligence services and military were giving orders to the
President, not the  other  way  around.   Nixon  (although he was
involved in the Kennedy assassination himself, as we looked at in
the "Guns of November," program #3, about  Watergate  connections
to  the assassination), Nixon wanted to basically gain control of
the whole show.  He didn't want to  be a servant; he wished to be
a master.  I think Davis's analysis in that respect  is  correct,
and that that was one of the reasons why he was ousted.
 
Many  people  feel  that  the  Kennedy  assassination and Nixon's
involvement in it was the lever  used to oust Richard Nixon.  The
fact that Kennedy's assassination and discussion of it appears to
have been involved *with* the Watergate tapes themselves we  went
into  in  great  length  in "Guns of November" #3.  Also, there's
some interesting information  in  an  interview  that  I had with
Gordon Novel(sp?), one of the principal figures in Jim Garrison's
investigation in New Orleans.  The full tape  is  available  from
Dav-Cor(sp?),  and  a  little blurb of that is something that you
hear on our little  promotional  part  that  I'm going to play in
just a couple minutes.
 
Again, this discussion of Katherine  Graham  and  the  Washington
Post,  and  their  mutual association with CIA, is being included
here not only for the  information about Watergate, the fact that
CIA official Richard Ober, in charge of Operation Chaos,  appears
to  have  been  Deep Throat, but primarily because, in connection
with  all  the  other  associations  --  Clay  Felker  and Gloria
Steinem, Elizabeth Forsling Harris -- it paints a rather  damning
picture  not  only of Gloria Steinem herself, and her association
with people like Pottinger  and  so  forth,  but  that it shows a
larger pattern of CIA co-operation with and manipulation  of  the
media.
