ELVIS (PROBABLY DEAD) STILL IN THE NEWS
=======================================

Elvis Presley, the rock  and  roll  star,  is probably long since
gone to the "Graceland in the  Sky."   Some,  though,  say  Elvis
still  is  alive,  or at least did not die when he is supposed to
have.  They point to  discrepancies  in medical examiner reports,
witness testimony, and where the body  was  found  (bathroom  vs.
bedroom).   (See *It's A Conspiracy* by Michael Litchfield; ISBN:
1-879682-10-9;   see   also,   *The    Elvis   Files*   by   Gail
Brewer-Giorgio, Shapolsky Publishers, 1990)

Sorry to disappoint Elvis  fans,  but  this  editor  thinks  he's
really dead. But he's still in the news.

1) The latest Penthouse magazine (August 1997) carries a "Special
Report" entitled "The Secret Sex Life of Elvis" (by Alanna Nash).
If  Elvis  is  a  hero  to  you,  you  might not want to read any
further.  According to the  Penthouse  article,  "The King" was a
bit unusual in some ways.  That does not detract from his being a
great singer; still, any macho image he had is now limping -- and
that's not all that's limp, according to Nash.  Reportedly, Elvis
had gone impotent in his  final  years,  due  at least in part to
extremely massive intake of narcotics, both uppers  and  downers.
That  is  ironic,  given  the famous picture of Elvis Presley and
Richard Nixon shaking hands in  the Oval Office:  Elvis was there
to offer help to Nixon in the  Ancient-War-On-Drugs.   Elvis  the
Pelvis,  whose  "drug  protocol,"  says Nash, "was so intense and
stultifying that often he would get up in the middle of the night
to use the bathroom and never  make  it back to bed...  [He would
wind up in the bathroom,] sprawled on the floor, zonked  out  and
cruising  his  own  private  hemisphere,"  was also, according to
Litchfield, "an honorary  Agent-at-Large  of the Drug Enforcement
Administration."
   I hesitate to go further.   I will, but with the understanding
that drug addiction can happen  to  anyone,  and,  to  paraphrase
"Chief Broom" from Ken Kesey's novel, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest*:  "At first Elvis swallowed  the drugs; later on, the drugs
swallowed Elvis."
   Elvis allegedly had a thing for young adolescent girls.   Nash
speculates  that "The King" was overly attached to his mother and
could not relate  normally  to  mature women; presumably, Presley
sought out very young girls because he felt threatened  by  women
his  own  age.   As  time  passed, the rock legend's alleged drug
abuse took an  increasing  toll:   his  weight  ballooned to 250+
pounds and eager groupies expecting a hot night  with  the  macho
symbol found instead that he was unable to perform sexually.  And
here's  what  else  drugs did to Elvis:  "Elvis occasionally lost
control of his  bladder  and  bowels,  which  meant more than one
woman awoke to find a surprise in the bed."  (Nash)
   So, is Elvis dead?  Sure.  Drugs do that to you.

2) In a separate item, The Spotlight this week (7/14/97)  focuses
on  a report in The Star (6/26/97) which claims that The "Church"
of Scientology is responsible  for  reported health and emotional
problems of Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis Presley's  daughter.   Lisa
Marie  Presley, reportedly a member of Scientology, has allegedly
"become totally captured by Scientology" and "anyone who gets too
close  [to  Ms.  Presley]  is surrounded by uniformed Scientology
security guards  and  pressured  to  move  on."   (Spotlight) The
Spotlight also quotes from the late Elvis Presley  regarding  his
opinions  on Scientology:  "That s.o.b. group -- all they want is
my money."  Has Lisa  Marie  Presley  been captured, (a la Howard
Hughes, but by a different gang)?   Is  Scientology  still  after
Elvis's money?
