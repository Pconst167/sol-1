UPDATE: JUNE 1, 1996: THE ANDREUCCETTI AFFAIR
=============================================
 
The  June  *1995*  issue  of  the  Conspiracy  Nation  Newsletter
featured an  exclusive  interview  with  Mr. Joseph Andreuccetti,
Sherman Skolnick, and this editor.   That  entire  interview  has
since  been  archived  at  the  prairienet.org  site (see below).
Also, in case anyone is  interested,  the photo of myself and Mr.
Skolnick,  found  in  Kenn  Thomas'  book,  *Popular  Alienation*
(Illuminet Press, 1995.  ISBN:  1-881532-07-0) was  taken  during
that interview.
 
To refresh the  reader's  memory  regarding  the  series of court
cases often referred to as simply "The Andreuccetti Affair", here
is a relevant excerpt from issue number  12  of  the  Steamshovel
Press magazine:
 
  Joe  Andreuccetti, a subcontractor in Wood Dale, Illinois, is
  originally from  Lucca,  in  Northern  Italy.  Andreuccetti's
  relations include the founder of the Bank of America and  the
  CEO  of  the Bank of Lucca.  Lucca was the staging area for a
  shipment of a European gold  horde  to the U.S. It was stolen
  in 1943 under the direction of General George S. Patton  with
  the  help  of the Sicilian Mafia.  The purpose was prevention
  of another world  war  instigated  by  Europeans, by reducing
  their mad money.  Pro-Nazi Pope Pius XII was receptive to the
  idea but he wanted some agreement that the gold would  return
  within an appropriate period -- 50 years.
 
Here too is  a  relevant  excerpt  from  the June 1995 Conspiracy
Nation Newsletter interview:
 
  CONSPIRACY NATION: So where'd the $50 million come from?
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI:  From the Federal  Home  Board  [Federal
    Home Loan Bank Board].
  SHERMAN SKOLNICK: And a step-sister of that is the RTC.
  CONSPIRACY NATION:  But they had set it aside in anticipation
    of...
  JOSEPH  ANDREUCCETTI:   In  anticipation  of several lawsuits
    pending against American Heritage Savings & Loan.
  CONSPIRACY  NATION:   Okay.   So  it  *wasn't*  set  aside in
    anticipation of any claims that you had.
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI: I was the strongest claim!
  SHERMAN SKOLNICK: He's the only pending claim.
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI:  And the only  pending  claim,  to  this
    day.  All the other claims were worn out.
  SHERMAN SKOLNICK: The other claims were of no consequence.
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI: They were worn out! They were worn out.
  CONSPIRACY  NATION:   Okay, but then the money was needed, to
    hide a bank embezzlement down in Arkansas...
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI: Yeah. Arkansas.
  CONSPIRACY NATION: And so, it disappeared to Arkansas.
  JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI: Correct.
      And I never had my day of trial.
 
Now comes the  following  information,  which  may  or may not be
relevant here:
                                      
  TRUTH IN SPEAKING (House of Representatives - May 29, 1996)
                                      
  [Page: H5627]
 
  The SPEAKER pro tempore.   Under  a  previous  order  of  the
  House,  the  gentleman  from  California  [Mr.  Dornan  ]  is
  recognized for 5 minutes.
   
  Mr.  DORNAN .  Mr. Speaker, there are so many subjects racing
  through my mind right  now  for  a 5-minute special order.  I
  was going to talk about an Army hero who was killed in Bosnia
  trying to, to use his own words from a few hours  before  his
  death,  clear  these  stinking minefields for the children of
  Bosnia, but the last gentlewoman  began her remarks by saying
  it is time for truth in speaking.
   
  Let  me  tell  the  gentlewoman,  as  somebody  who   started
  investigating  Little  Rock in 1992, before the Clintons were
  in the White house, I think Little Rock, just Little Rock, in
  an otherwise great State, and  only  in the field of politics
  with some businesspeople, was a stinking hole of  corruption;
  with  not  this  current  Governor, but the prior Governor, a
  stinking hole of  corruption.   And  that  like Hamlet's line
  about  murder,  though  it  hath  no  tongue,  will  by  most
  miraculous organ out, all of this financial  corruption  will
  by  most miraculous organ out by, using her very words, truth
  in speaking.
   
  [Page: H5628]
 
  Mr. BURTON  of  Indiana.   Mr.  Speaker,  will  the gentleman
  yield?
   
  Mr. DORNAN . I yield to the gentleman from [Indiana.]
   
  Mr. BURTON of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, what I did in my special
  order  was  ask  a  number  of  questions  that  were   still
  unanswered.   One of the questions that I think is very, very
  important  is  why  did  the  Arkansas  Development Financial
  Authority send $50 million of Arkansas money  to  the  Cayman
  Islands  to deposit in a bank in the Cayman Islands, which is
  a major drug transit  point  acknowledged by almost every DEA
  agent in the world?  Why  would  they  send  $50  million  of
  Arkansas  money down there?  That is a question that needs to
  be answered.
   
  I have the electronic bank  transfer statements in my office.
  I am going to put them in the Congressional Record.  There is
  no doubt the money was wired  to  the  Cayman  Islands.   The
  question  needs to be asked, why was it wired?  Why would the
  Governor of  Arkansas  allow  that?   Why  would the Arkansas
  Development Financial Authority,  a  State-run  agency,  send
  their  money out of the country to a drug haven?  I hope that
  the independent counsel will  explore  that.  We are going to
  ask other questions as well.
   
  Mr. DORNAN .  Mr. Speaker, no one other  than  the  gentleman
  has  investigated the Vince Foster thing or analyzed it.  And
  the line of Vince  Foster's  that  comes  back to us from the
  grave about the whole Whitewater mess and  the  IRS  problems
  was,  these are Vince Foster's words, `This is a can of worms
  we do not want to open.' The can of worms was opened in front
  of that jury and they got 24 felony convictions.
