LATEST "TOE-SUCKING" NEWS OF CLINTON & ENTOURAGE
================================================
 
King Clinton, choo-chooing  to  Chicago  sans Hillary, enjoys the
view.  His SS  (Secret  Service)  makes  sure  the  King  not  be
disturbed by any who might shout at him that "He sucks."  So, the
SS  rounds  up 100 farmers in Ashland, Kentucky, and marches them
away.  Dumbfounded,  the  farmers  say  they  were  only carrying
signs, so what's the big deal?  Ah, but SS is not fooled:   those
signs  are  mounted  on  sticks  -- potential weapons against the
King.
 
All along his train  ride,  King  Clinton  need  not  fear  stick
attacks  nor  even  angry  protesters;  his  SS  and  "Democratic
operatives"  have  silenced  protests all along the route, writes
Andy Thibault in the  August  29,  1996 Washington Times ("Secret
Service accused of preventing protests.")
 
In Chicago, His Highness  can  avoid  being aware that some folks
don't like him, thanks to protesters not being allowed  too  near
the United Center.  Sure they can protest, but not where they can
be  easily seen by Dems and press and the King.  What's next?  Do
protesters get sent away even further, to "Siberia?"
 
Then comes shocking news  of  Dick Morris, Clinton insider, found
to be a steady patron of a $200/hour Washington call girl.   Says
a  reporter  for  Nation magazine, interviewed by Pacifica Radio,
"bottom  slapping,  toe  sucking,   and  use  of  handcuffs"  was
involved.  *But*, did Morris pull down his pants and  say,  "Kiss
it?"
 
There  is  said  to  be  a  videotape  of  Morris  *in flagraante
delicto*, which raises the question:  Was Morris set up?  Was the
"call girl" being used as part of  a  "dirty  tricks"  operation?
Where  was  the  cameraman?  Behind a one-way mirror while Morris
was allegedly providing advance  copies  of  the Gore and Hillary
speeches to Sweet Toes?  *Who* is the witness to  Morris  calling
King  Bill,  "monster,"  and Queen Hill, "twister?"  *How* was he
able to witness Morris  letting Sweet Toes surreptitiously listen
in on his phone conversation with Clinton?
 
Says Morris, responding to the allegations, "I won't dignify that
with  a response."  This is like what Mike McCurry said regarding
proof that the "Foster suicide note" is a forgery; said the White
House Press  Secretary,  "I  won't  discuss conspiracy theories."
 
The ancient Roman writer, Cicero, in *De Divinatione*, tells  how
many of his time believed in signs and omens.  Many then believed
that  "in  the  case  of birds... those known as *alites*... give
omens by their flight,  to  fly  hither and thither and disappear
now here and now there..."  (By "alites" are meant birds like the
eagle, hawk, and osprey.)  What is the omen when Clinton,  around
last  4th  of  July, set free an eagle that flew off but was then
attacked by an osprey and plummetted to the ground?
 
What is the omen when  a  speaker's platform, two hours before it
is apparently about to bear the weight of King  Clinton  Himself,
collapses   in   Michigan  City,  Indiana,  and  injures  several
spectators?
 
What is the omen when, on  Clinton's crowning night in Chicago, a
lurid scandal breaks involving a top Clinton lieutenant?
 
Good-bye,  William  J.  A   recent  correspondence  with  *enfant
terrible* J. Orlin Grabbe indicates that Professor Grabbe is  not
backing  down from his prediction that, by this November, William
J. Clinton will not  be  the  Dems' candidate for U.S. President.
His prediction is supported by Wesley Pruden, Editor-in-Chief  of
the  Washington  Times,  who  wrote today (Aug. 29, 1996, "How to
give  America  a  really   good  cry")  about  Hillary  Clinton's
"prospective troubles with the  law  in  the  person  of  Kenneth
Starr"  being  "a  subject  of growing speculation here."  Add to
that William Safire's  prediction  that  an indictment of Hillary
for perjury and obstruction  of  justice  seems  to  be  "in  the
pipeline"  (ca.   Aug.  20, 1996, "Election shouldn't slow law"),
and King Clinton may decide, after he gets re-crowned in Chicago,
to just say "The heck with it" and hop on a bus headed south.
