DIANA & DODI MURDERED?
======================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------

Were Princess Diana and her  intended  new husband, an Arab, Dodi
Al-Fayed, murdered?

Heiress to a worldwide banking fortune, Diana was about to  merge
with  big Arab money:  a disaster for the financial powers of the
western world.  On August 31,  1997,  Diana  and Dodi died from a
car crash in a tunnel, in Paris.  On the  same  day,  the  London
Sunday Mirror had already gone to press with a story that, at the
request  of  the  Queen of England, British counter-intelligence,
MI-6, had prepared a  report  on  the goings-on between Diana and
Dodi, which tended to  further  undermine  the  Monarchy.   Being
considered was the possible exile of Diana.  =But=, her older son
is in line to be the new King of England.  The British paper also
said  the  Queen  was  planning  to damage Harrods, in London, by
stripping it of her  royal  approval.   A large department store,
Harrods is owned by Dodi's father, Mohammed  Al-Fayed.   It  does
big business with the royals.

Myself  and  the  Citizens'  Committee  to  Clean  Up  the Courts
(773-731-1100 for recorded  message)  did  stories about how U.S.
and British Intelligence jointly conducted "Operation Clydesdale"
to  snuff  out  porno  kings,  pedophiles,  and  other  suspected
low-lifes, without a judicial trial, using the team's  specialty:
faked-up  car  crashes.   Their headquarters is now reportedly in
Bristol, as well as elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  A member of
that unit was  reportedly  Gunther  K.  Russbacher,  who has dual
citizenship in the United States and  Austria.   [Mr.  Russbacher
denies  any involvement with the unit.] Gunther Russbacher called
me from Bristol and warned me to shut up.

In April 1998, Dodi's father  sent  his chief of security to meet
in Vienna, Austria, with someone offering to sell  documents  for
10  million  British  pounds.  The documents reportedly show that
British Intelligence had asked  the  American  CIA to help murder
Princess Diana.  Apparently, in a cynical trick  to  surface  the
whole  mess  without paying big money, the CIA and FBI were asked
to monitor the  meeting.   Thereafter,  the  CIA  and FBI had the
mystery  man  --  the  one  offering  to  sell  the  documents --
arrested.  [1] He reportedly is a retired  officer  of  the  U.S.
Naval   Intelligence   (ONI),   reportedly  knows  ONI  Commander
Russbacher, and  is  well-informed  on  Operation Clydesdale-type
assassinations.

The   documents   had  apparently  been  stolen  from  the  FBI's
counter-intelligence  wing,  Division  5.   British  and American
covert operatives were in the team of cars which  pushed  Diana's
Mercedes  up  against  a  pillar,  causing  the death of Dodi and
Diana. 

The American agents in  Vienna  claimed  they had jurisdiction to
arrest the mystery man, because stealing the  documents  violated
U.S.  national security.  Among the secrets contained:  that Bill
Clinton, as president,  had  offered  to assist Diana-in-exile to
become a U.S. citizen, along with her new husband, Dodi.  So, the
new King of England, Diana's eldest son, would have  been  raised
in  Los  Angeles  under  the  wing of his step-father, an Arab --
unacceptable to the Monarchy.

The trial of the arrested mystery  man  is  to be in secret, in a
soundproof court, in the District of Columbia.

Some, but not all, of these details were in wire service stories.
But the mass media pretended they didn't exist.   Hey:   Call  up
your  local  newsfakers  and  tell  them to stop lying about what
happened to Princess Diana and Dodi Al-Fayed, huh?
