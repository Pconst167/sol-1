INTERNATIONALISM: AN OLD TRICK
==============================

In 1930-31,  Father  Charles  Coughlin  gave  a  series  of radio
sermons, later transcribed into a book,  "By  The  Sweat  of  Thy
Brow"  (The  Radio  League  of  the Little Flower, 1931).  Father
Coughlin defined labor as a fundamental human right, as did Union
General (and Congressman) James  B.  Weaver  (*A Call To Action*,
1892). Wrote General Weaver:

  All men have a natural right to a portion of the soil;  and
  as  the use of the soil is indispensable to life, the right
  of all men to the soil is  as sacred as their right to life
  itself.

  The child... comes into this world  clothed  with  all  the
  natural  rights  which  Adam possessed when he was the sole
  inhabitant of the earth.  Liberty to occupy the soil in his
  own right, to till  it  unmolested  as  soon  as he has the
  strength to do so and to live upon the fruits of  his  toil
  without paying tribute to any other creature, are among the
  most sacred and essential of these rights; and any state of
  society which deprives men of these natural and inalienable
  safeguards,   is   an   organized   rebellion  against  the
  providence of God, a  conspiracy  against  human life and a
  menace to the peace of the community.

                       -+- The Laborer -+-

Father  Coughlin,  while   acknowledging  that  "labor"  includes
creative and intellectual labor, limits  his  definition  to  the
bulk of laborers: miners, farmers and factory workers:

  There  is  not one item in life which is independent of the
  laborer.  Identified with every gold  coin which is sent on
  its  mission  of  wealth;  intimately  related   to   every
  locomotive which moves freight and produce and human beings
  across  our  continent;  back  of every airplane that skims
  past the skyline and over  the  clouds, there is some human
  being who has delved into the  earth  to  fetch  forth  the
  gold,  to  fabricate  the  engine,  and  to spin for us the
  silken wings which fill the sky.

He then goes on to stress  that  work  is a human right, based on
"the law of self-preservation which the Creator of human life has
so impressed upon every individual that it supersedes every other
law and annuls  every  man-made  legislation  which  unreasonably
comes  in  conflict  with  it."   Coughlin's  "three  fundamental
notions of life" are:
1) Man is a social citizen.
2) He and every other citizen has the right to preserve his life.
3)  The  primary  law  of  physical  preservation  is essentially
connected with labor.

                   -+- Where Money Is King -+-

But mass consumption cannot keep up with mass production.  As the
machinery has  improved,  two  contrary  things  occur:   (1) the
laborer is not as necessary, since the machine can do  ever  more
of  his  labor,  and  (2)  since  the  laborer  is  no  longer as
necessary, he becomes seasonally  unemployed and cannot so easily
afford (consume/purchase) the items of mass production.  Coughlin
is ahead of his time when he  urges  that  there  be  less  hours
worked  by  those already employed so that =all= may be employed.
The "radio priest" also condemned  the vast gap in wealth between
the few ultra rich and the masses of workers just  struggling  to
provide  for  themselves  and their families.  (Quoting from Pope
Leo XIII:  "the concentration  of  many  branches of trade in the
hands of a few individuals, a small number of very rich men  have
been  able  to lay upon the teeming masses of the laboring poor a
yoke that is little better than slavery itself.") Coughlin is not
a communist nor a socialist, but  he does urge that a living wage
must be paid to all workers.

Money, says Coughlin, is  "substantially  related to labor."  Man
is a social citizen (see point #1, above).   Each  citizen  is  a
unit  of  a nation "whose social duties obligate him first to the
political family of his  fellow  citizens."  (This does not imply
no obligation to mankind in general, but the  =first=  obligation
is  to "the political family of his fellow citizens.") It follows
from this that the ultra rich  cannot use their great wealth in a
manner contrary to the general good of their countrymen.

So how can these  ultra  rich  (the  one-third of one percent who
control half the wealth of  the  country)  commandeer  "the  many
billions  of  American  dollars  made  by  American laborers" and
expend them "building factories  and creating industries abroad"?
Coughlin warns that eventually "these foreign nations will be our
competitors," that eventually they will force down the wages paid
to American workers.  Add to this the billions  of  dollars  sent
abroad as foreign aid:

  ...American money to the extent of eighteen billion dollars
  loaned  abroad  since [World War I].  From the year 1920 to
  1928 foreign loans amounting  to  14.5 billion dollars were
  publicly offered and accepted.  Since that date other loans
  have been negotiated  privately...   Add  to  this  the  12
  billion  dollars  of a government war loan.  And the result
  is, that Europe and South America  owe us today at least 30
  billion dollars, the interest on which  these  nations  are
  now unable to pay...

  If  gold  or  money is substantially related to labor, then
  the exportation  of  American  gold  in  such  abnormal and
  stupendous quantities is equivalent to the  exportation  of
  sixty billion hours of American labor valued at 50 cents an
  hour  [1930  rates],  or  enough  to  keep approximately 30
  million workmen busy for one whole year.

Yes, says Coughlin, here  on  earth  the  ultra  rich  own  their
wealth;  but  they  are the =stewards= of that wealth.  He quotes
from St. Thomas Aquinas:

  The temporal goods which God  permits  to  a man are his in
  regard to property.  But in regard to use they are not  his
  alone,  but  others  also  who  can be sustained by what is
  superfluous to him.  If  the  individual owner neglects his
  social responsibilities, it is the duty  of  the  State  to
  enforce their observance.

What  is the morality of "those Americans who made their money by
the sweat of  the  brows  of  American  laborers  and then expend
tremendous portions of  it  in  foreign  countries  to  build  up
competitors   in  the  industrial  market  against  their  fellow
citizens"?

American money has been (and  is  being) exported abroad where it
"will compete in neutral markets with our own industries."

            -+- "Scribes" Have Wrought Desolation -+-

Almost 2500 years ago, it is recorded "that a condition  somewhat
similar  to  ours  was  extant...  among  the Jewish people.  For
personal reasons  their  leaders  preferred  to  be  blind to the
situation, thinking that they could quell the disturbance in  the
public  mind  by  the childish trick of crying, >>'Peace, Peace':
when there was no peace.<< (Jeremias 8:11)"

"The scribes [journalists] who depended for their livelihood upon
the great men of the  nation  were  content to remain silent lest
their revenues be revoked.  In fact they even co-operated in this
childish diplomacy of propagating the lie >>'Peace, Peace':  when
there was no peace.<<"

"No wonder, therefore, that  the  prophet  expressed  himself  in
unmistakable  language  when  he wrote that 'the lying pen of the
scribes hath wrought our desolation.' (Jeremias 8:8)"

"A similar circumstance has  arisen  today.  The modern scribe or
journalist  or  publisher...  too  often  finds  himself   openly
partisan at the expense of honesty and brazenly optimistic at the
expense  of  truth as he comforts himself with the sophistry that
all the news is not good for  the people.  Only that news is good
which benefits the apostles of privilege."

             -+- Internationalism: An Old Trick -+-

Internationalism is a recurring  scheme  favored by those wanting
to hog wealth and power.  Alexander the  Great  was  imbued  with
political  internationalism  "when  he  desired to Persianize the
entire world...  So was  Augustus  Caesar.  So was Napoleon whose
secret ambition was to make the world his  footstool  and  France
his  throne."   And  so  did  Adolph  Hitler  seek eventual world
conquest for  his  Third  Reich.   And  so does/did international
communism seek world conquest. Communism

  according to its founder, Adam Weishaupt,  from  whom  Karl
  Marx drew his inspiration... is necessarily identified with
  atheism...  This is the first tenet of communism...

  The second general belief of communism is expressed by  the
  word 'internationalism.'

Internationalism is "a  heresy  which  strikes  at  the  root  of
patriotism and prosperity:  and aims not at elevating all peoples
to the standard of American living, but rather at the leveling of
our standard to the common denominator of foreign misery."

         -+- Loathsome Re-birth of Internationalism -+-

"The most loathsome after-birth of the [First] World War has been
the revival of this  internationalism  which in its last analysis
is nothing more than universal class rule.  On the one  hand  the
Soviet desires to control the entire world by the military arm of
an  enslaved laboring class.  And on the part of certain captains
of industry and finance there seems to be a determination to rule
the universe through the agency of wealth."

"Identified both with the  League  of  Nations and with the World
Court... is this new Colossus called the International Bank."  In
the minds of many, the birth of the International Bank is a story
into which is woven "the J.P. Morgan Banking Company... the  Bank
of  England;  [and] the names of certain gentlemen in our Federal
Reserve Bank...   Acting  in  collusion,  these  men succeeded in
lowering American money to 3.5 percent; then exported  more  than
500 million dollars in gold to Europe..."

"Now  that  our  gold  has  been  poured  into Europe, these same
international  bankers  of  Wall  Street  and  of  Washington are
anxious that our  nation  shall  surrender  its  independence  by
becoming  a  member  of  'The  Permanent  Court  of International
Justice of the League of Nations.'"

(Coughlin's "International Bank" may  or  may  not be the same as
the "Bank for  International  Settlements."   Since  Coughlin  is
speaking  circa  1930 of a "new Colossus called the International
Bank,"  it  seems  likely  he   is  referring  to  the  Bank  for
International     Settlements.      In      Charles      Higham's
highly-recommended  book on how corporate America continued doing
business with Nazi Germany, even  during World War II -- *Trading
With the Enemy:   The  Nazi-American  Money  Plot  1933-1949*  --
background  is  given  on  the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS):  "The  Bank  for  International  Settlements  was  a joint
creation in 1930 of the  world's  central  banks,  including  the
Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.  Its existence was inspired by
Hjalmar Schacht, Nazi Minister of  Economics and president of the
Reichsbank."  The BIS turned into "a money  funnel  for  American
and  British  funds  to  flow  into  Hitler's coffers and to help
Hitler build up his war machine.")

          -+- Abraham Lincoln's Warning to America -+-

Just  before  he  died, Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter to a close
friend in Illinois.  Here is part  of what he is reported to have
said:

  Yes, we may all congratulate ourselves that the [Civil War]
  is nearing its close.   It  has  cost  a  great  amount  of
  treasure  and  of  blood.   But I see in the near future, a
  crisis  approaching  that  unnerves  me  and  causes  me to
  tremble for the safety of my country.

  As a result of the war, corporations  have  been  enthroned
  and  an  era of corruption in high places will follow.  The
  money power of  the  country  will  endeavor to prolong its
  reign by working upon the prejudices of  the  people  until
  all  wealth  is aggregated in a few hands, and the Republic
  is destroyed.  I feel at  this  moment more anxiety for the
  safety of my country than ever before, even in the midst of
  war. God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless.

Extrapolating  from   Coughlin's   analysis,   with   its   1930s
perspective,  we  now  know  that in the struggle between the two
"evil  empires"  --  International  Communism  and  International
Corporatism -- the latter  appears  to  have triumphed.  The lust
for wealth, power and world conquest is  =not=  something  "brand
new,"  but  its  current  disguise  of  benevolence  and "'Peace,
Peace':  when there is no  peace"  =is= new.  Do not be deceived;
beware of wolves in sheep's clothing.
