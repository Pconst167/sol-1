"Ru Mills" --
        WHOEVER CONTROLS PRINCESS DIANA CONTROLS THE WORLD
        ==================================================

[Here is Ru Mills' account  of  the death of Princess Diana.  "Ru
Mills" is a pseudonym; formerly she  published  the  "Rumor  Mill
News."   Consider  all of what follows, unless specifically noted
otherwise, as "according to Ru Mills."]

Princess Diana  and  her  soon-to-be  husband,  Dodi  Fayed, were
fatally injured in the  Pont  de  l'Alma  tunnel.   The  site  is
ancient,  dating  back  to the time of the Merovingian kings (ca.
500 - 751 A.D.), and before.  In pre-Christian times, the Pont de
l'Alma was a  pagan  sacrificial  site.   Note  that in the pagan
connotation, at least, sacrifice  is  not  to  be  confused  with
murder: the sacrificial victim had to be a willing participant.

In the time of the Merovingian kings, the Pont de l'Alma  was  an
underground  chamber.   Founder  of  the  Merovingian dynasty was
Merovaeus, said to be descended from  the union of a sea creature
and a French queen.  Merovaeus followed the pagan cult of  Diana.
In Middle English, "soul" (Alma) has as etymology "descended from
the sea."  "Pont,"  has  as  a  Latin  root "pontifex," meaning a
Roman high priest.  (See also pons, pontis --  bridge;  passage.)
"Alma"  comes  from  the  Latin "almus," meaning nourishing.  One
translation of Pont  de  l'Alma  would  be  "bridge of the soul."
Another would be "passage of  nourishment."   All  true  European
royalty is descended from the Merovingians, which are believed to
be descendants of Jesus Christ.

During the Merovingian  era,  if  two  kings  had  a dispute over
property, it was settled in combat at Pont de l'Alma.   According
to  legend,  anyone killed there goes straight to Heaven and sits
at the right hand of God,  watching  over  all his foe was to do.
The person killed in combat was actually  considered  to  be  the
"winner,"  since  he  became  God's  eyes on earth and even could
manipulate events.

The  current  British  royal  family are imposters.  The House of
Windsor is a fraud.  But  the  lineage of Lady Diana Spencer goes
back to Charles II of the House of Stewart.  The House of Stewart
is  of *true* royal blood.  Diana's sons, William and Harry, have
3-quarters true nobility in their blood.

Princess Diana was  in  a  powerful  position.  Two main factions
vied for control over her:  (1)  the  New  World  Order  faction,
founded on an alliance between King William III (Bank of England,
modern  system  of  finance,  and  "national  debt" all beginning
during his reign) and  later,  the  Rothschilds, and (2) the true
nobility of Europe.

*Within* the New World Order faction, there are smaller,  warring
factions, exemplified by Rothschilds vs.  Rockefellers.  The plan
of  the  New  World  Order  faction was to marry Lady Diana to an
American.  Even though  Bill  Clinton  has  bastard  roots in the
Rockefeller clan, he is rejected by them and is aligned with  the
Rothschilds.   Bill Clinton was the designated future husband for
Lady Diana, with Hillary Clinton to be eliminated through divorce
or even murder.  The Rockefellers  were  furious; in no way would
they allow a marriage between Bill Clinton and  Lady  Diana.   In
Great  Britain,  Prince William would be on the throne by age 25;
if Prince Charles  did  not  abdicate,  he would be assassinated.
Then, Prince Harry and the living Lady Diana would have moved  to
the  U.S. Harry would become a U.S. citizen and go into politics,
becoming perhaps a U.S. Senator.  By then, whoever controlled the
two boys -- Prince William and  Prince Harry -- would control the
world.

But in her last visit to the White  House,  circa  January  1997,
Lady  Diana  informed  Mr. Bill Clinton that in no way, shape, or
form would she *ever* marry  him.   (While in America, Lady Diana
also met with John Kennedy, Jr.)  Diana chose, instead, to  marry
for  love.   (Jackie Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis for power;
he could protect her.)

Dodi  Fayed,  beloved  of  Lady  Diana,  is  a  cousin  of  Adnan
Khashoggi, a CIA asset involved  in  sales  of arms to Iran -- he
and Oliver North.  Adnan Khashoggi is part  of  the  Saudi  royal
family.   Through  marrying  Dodi  Fayed,  Diana  would have been
marrying into the  Saudi  royal  family.   She  might have had to
convert to Islam.

British intelligence (MI-6) arranged the deaths of Lady Diana and
Dodi Fayed.  It was imperative that the Saudi  royal  family  not
have  control  over  Diana.  The driver of the ill-fated Mercedes
was a "Manchurian candidate" (brainwashed tool), with connections
to the French military.   How  did  so  much alcohol get into his
system?  Amounts  suggested  in  mass  media  reports  are  truly
staggering  --  so much alcohol that the driver would have had to
been carried to the car.  The way it happened was, the driver was
made to  swallow  special  slowly-digestible  balloons containing
high-potency alcohol.  While he drove, the balloons  were  slowly
digested and he became dangerous behind the wheel.

But even within British intelligence there are factions.  A rogue
faction in MI-6, powerless to prevent the assassination, arranged
for the deaths of Lady Diana and  Dodi Fayed to happen at Pont de
l'Alma.  Cleverly, it was known that a  death  at  that  historic
location would not only "send a signal"; it would eventually lead
to  the creation of a "Saint Diana."  In Roman paganism, Diana is
"Queen  of  Heaven,"  a  triple-goddess.   "Al-mah,"  in  mideast
language,  means  "moon  goddess."    One  aspect  of  the  Roman
triple-goddess is the "lunar virgin."  The  *al-mahs*  served  as
maidens of Diana, the lunar virgin.  In France, the Cult of Diana
was  so  powerful  that it wasn't until the Middle Ages until the
French gave up worship of the pagan goddess.  The *true*  Knights
Templar  (not to be confused with imposters) are sworn to protect
the Merovingian blood -- i.e., that of the *true* royals, such as
Lady Diana.   Before  too  long,  Project  Blue  Beam holographic
imaging will be used to create "miraculous appearances"  of  Lady
Diana.   Children  at various locations will be randomly selected
to witness "saintly apparitions."   These children will receive a
"message" from "Diana."  Some of the  children  will  claim  that
"Diana"  has given them healing powers -- and what is more, these
children  *will*  be   able   to   "heal."   Locations  of  these
"miraculous appearances" will become known as places  of  healing
and  sacred  shrines.   "Saint Diana's" two children, William and
Harry, will become akin to  two living Jesus Christs, walking the
earth.  It will be the start of "the new religion."  Who controls
the new religion controls the world.
