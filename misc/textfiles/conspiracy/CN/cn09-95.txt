NOTES OF MEETINGS/CONVERSATIONS ON INSLAW & FOSTERGATE (10/21/95)
=================================================================
                 By "Mr. Mercedes" (Pseudonym)
                 -----------------------------
 
When James Norman  wrote  the  Forbes  1/31/95 cover story, "Oil,
Guns & Greed" where he had worked for five years and was a Senior
Editor at a $100,000 year salary.  The focus of this cover  story
was  Carlos Cardoen, a Chilean arms merchant who sold hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of  cluster  bombs and other weapons to
Iraq, while using Chase Manhattan Bank to finance  his  operation
through  "set  up"  oil  trades and with the full cooperation and
knowledge of DCI [Director  of  Central Intelligence] Bill Gates.
He probably had no idea where it would lead  and  that  6  months
later  he  would  be  abruptly fired on 8/16 and less than a week
after I told him  in  person  that  he  should expect to be fired
quite soon because of what he had written outside of  Forbes  and
because of what he was continuing to investigate.
 
The  Cardoen  story led Norman to Harry Wechsler, Pres. of Boston
Systematics and, purportedly,  a  former  CIA and/or Mossad agent
who has also been selling Inslaw's bootlegged and bugged enhanced
PROMIS software around the world.  Wechsler was also a key person
involved in pulling off the October Surprise  for  the  Israelis,
according  to  Lt.  Commander  Alexander  Martin  (Ret.), who was
involved in many 1980s covert  ops  as an aide to General Richard
Secord (Ret.), and is now assisting with  the  investigations  of
the  House  Whitewater Committee.  Wechsler's daughter, Dana, has
been a senior editor  at  Forbes  for  6-7  years, a CIA contract
employee, and both have been sources for James Norman.   The  big
question  is,  did  they feed Norman disinformation to direct him
away from Wechsler's key role in  the illegal sale of PROMIS from
his subsidiary company, Israeli Systematics.
 
This article led Norman into [investigating] government  software
theft  and  espionage,  covert  activities  of computerized money
laundering and drugs  and  arms  dealing,  interweaving a cast of
characters, government  agencies  and  companies  which  include:
Inslaw,  the  CIA,  NSA,  Mossad,  Vince Foster, Webster Hubbell,
Robert   Maxwell,   Arkansas    billionaire   Jackson   Stephens,
Systematics (Jackson Stephens-owned company and now  merged  into
Alltel  with Stephen's 8 percent interest), numerous secret Swiss
bank accounts, which  lead  right  up  to  and  included Bill and
Hillary Clinton, and former Presidents Reagan and Bush, all  sown
together  with  a  thread  called PROMIS (Prosecutor's Management
Information Systems) software.
 
The intent of  this  report  is  to  present  evidence and leads,
without pre-conceived notions or hidden agendas, which should  be
objectively  investigated and reported by unbiased journalists in
order to  honestly  verify  or  refute  the  information of James
Norman and others.  This document doesn't presume to be the final
word, but it is an attempt  to  lay  out  possible  evidence  and
people within the Clinton administration, Park Police, Department
of Justice, [which] Kenneth Starr's investigations and the Senate
and House Whitewater/Foster hearings should be investigating.
 
One  of the most invisible and invincible central figures in this
cast is Jackson Stephens.   He  has  been  a major contributor to
Bush, loaned the Clinton Election Committee a critical $2 million
from  his  family's  Worthen  Bank  (Stephens  recently  had   it
purchased by the larger Boatsman Bank of St. Louis, thus ending a
Federal  Reserve  investigation),  and is now, of all things, the
Finance Chairman for Bob  Dole.   Stephens  is  an investor in or
owner of numerous companies such as Beverly Enterprises (a  major
national  nursing  home  chain  and  one of Earl Brian's numerous
companies; Earl Brian, another central figure, will be  described
later), and two Arkansas newspapers, the Northwest Arkansas Times
and  the  Morning  News  of  Northwest Arkansas.  He was also the
original front man for BCCI  in  the  late 1970s when he tried to
get them (M. Potts, N. Kochan &  R.  Whittington,  "Dirty  Money:
The  Inside  Story  of BCCI" and John Beaty "Outlaw Bank:  BCCI")
into the U.S. through the purchase of First American (Wall Street
Journal  article,  8/7/95,  "Who  is  Dan  Lasater,"  Wall Street
Journal 2-page profile article, ?/?/93, and Monetary  &  Economic
Review  6/92  article,  "Clinton Selected to be Next President"),
prior to Clark Clifford and Roger Altman getting involved through
First American Bank.
 
Despite Mike  Wallace's  "60  Minutes"  10/18  shoddy and slanted
hatch-job  report  on  journalist  Christopher  Ruddy  and   Lisa
Foster's  New Yorker 9/11/95 "conspiracy rebuttal" article, a big
mystery still remains as to whether  or  not all or some of these
elements and inter-related people  came  together  to  cause  the
death of Vince Foster.  As Chicago investigative reporter Sherman
Skolnick   states,  Lisa  Foster's  "cover-up"  story  should  be
seriously questioned.  In his  9/11/95 "The Money Trail" release,
Skolnick reports that Lisa Foster received $285,000 just  4  days
prior  to  Vince  Foster's  death  from  bank heir Richard Mellon
Scaife,  who  passed  it  through  Sheila  Foster  Anthony (Vince
Foster's sister and former  Congressman  Beryl  Anthony's  wife).
Furthermore,  it just so happens that Sheila Foster Anthony is in
a very important Department of  Justice section which is involved
in appointments of  Federal  Judges,  U.S.  Attorneys,  and  U.S.
Marshalls.   Also,  Richard  Mellon  Scaife  is  facing  possible
prosecution  on  alleged  federal  banking regulations violations
(Sarah McClendon's Washington Report, 9/5/95).
 
Additionally, when  Lisa  Foster  was  questioned  by  the FBI on
5/1/94, she raised doubts about Vince Foster's so-called "suicide
note."  She stated that Vince Foster had written it on  or  about
7/11/93  and they were his talking points for a scheduled meeting
on 7/22/93  with  the  President  and  an  upcoming Congressional
hearing, neither of which Vince Foster kept since he was  already
conveniently  dead  on  7/20.   Additionally  that so-called last
"relaxation weekend" at  major  Clinton and Democratic fundraiser
Nathan Landau's shore estate with Webster Hubbell and others  was
a  "damage control" session, bugged by the CIA, for the impending
scandal  described  below  in   which   Vince  Foster  was  under
investigation for espionage.
 
Besides all the forensic and crime scene  discrepancies  and  the
apparent  "cover-up" by the White House personnel's inappropriate
actions after Foster's death, there was a significant discrepancy
with the gun Vince  Foster  supposedly  shot himself with and the
"silver colored gun" which Lisa Foster also  told  the  FBI  that
Vince  had brought with him from Arkansas.  (Mike Blair's "Foster
Gun, Note Questions"  Spotlight  8/21/95).   If  Vince Foster was
shot with the "silver colored gun" which was found  in  the  park
near  his body, why did Lisa Foster find another gun in its place
on the very night after  his  death?  And finally, in addition to
all the other mysterious evidence found on or  around  his  body,
why  did  ballistics and forensics experts find that Vince Foster
was shot by a turn-of-the-century Colt .38 caliber Army revolver?
 
James Norman completed his Vince Foster story for Forbes in April
of 1995 and it was ready  for publication in the May issue, after
being thoroughly checked and edited, but [it]  was  pulled  after
receiving   an  April  25  letter  from  the  White  House  Press
Secretary, Michael McCurry.  Norman  was then given permission to
have his article published  by  another  magazine  (Media  Bypass
Magazine,   8/95,   "Fostergate")   if  he  withheld  his  Forbes
affiliation.  He  has  just  come  out  with  a followup article,
"Fostergate II" in the 10/95 [Media Bypass] issue.  Norman claims
he was fired for  continuing  to  investigate  the  Vince  Foster
story,  which  led  back  to Forbes' Chairman Emeritus and former
Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger.  Forbes' media relations
person, Ray Healy, claimed  that  "James Norman resigned and that
he was a good journalist and they would miss him," but because of
their editorial policy he would not comment on  anything  written
outside of Forbes.
 
In  the  process  of investigating the Vince Foster story, Norman
came into  contact  with  Charles  "Chuck"  Hayes,  purportedly a
former CIA  agent  with  S1  clearance  (highest  level)  with  a
codename  of  "Running Fox."  In my interview with him, he claims
to have been involved in the CIA's Cuba covert ops to run weapons
into Castro to overthrow  Pres.   Batista.   Hayes stated that he
knew George Bush as the CIA's paymaster as far back as 1958,  all
of  which  he  [Bush]  denies  (see [J. Edgar] Hoover 1963 letter
which refers to Bush of CIA).  On one occasion, he [Hayes] claims
to have put a gun into  Bush's  mouth  in order to get him to pay
up.  [CN:  Bush reportedly leaked in his pants  at  that  point.]
While  serving  in  Vietnam in covert ops, Hayes disobeyed orders
and flew his jet fighter  into  Hanoi  and took out a SAM missile
storage depot.  On a Mena, Arkansas arms flight to  the  Contras,
he discovered coke [cocaine] stored in the belly of his plane and
dumped  it  on  the  awaiting  covert  team  at the airport while
avoiding being shot down by them.
