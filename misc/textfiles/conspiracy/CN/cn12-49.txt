Act Three
---------
The Speaker and the President
-----------------------------
Bill Clinton will never resign  until Newt Gingrich is replaced
---------------------------------------------------------------

About 2 years ago Rumor  Mill  News  ran  a series of articles in
which we outlined the three different ways that Faction 2 of  the
Intel  community was planning on getting rid of Bill and Hillary.
[According to knowledgeable sources, there are competing factions
within the Intelligence "community".]

The first attempt to  force  Clinton  to  resign  was back in 96.
People within the Democratic Party tried to  force  him  to  step
down,  not  run, or purposely lose the election.  This was called
the Bush route.  It would have been the easiest and least painful
to everyone.

The second plan that  was  being  considered was called the Nixon
route, and that is what we have playing out at the moment.

The third route, one that was abandoned  early  in  the  planning
stages,  was  the  Kennedy route.  They abandoned it because they
knew it would make him a  martyr and they knew Hillary could ride
his casket right into the White House.

After all of the plans had been floated, and  the  President  had
been  confronted  with  what  his  fate  would be if he failed to
withdraw from the race,  or  purposely  lose  the race, Faction 2
realized that the President couldn't resign or purposely lose the
race.  They discovered that he was  being  blackmailed  with  the
threat  of  death if he resigned.  Some say it is the Chinese who
are threatening, some say  it  is the International moneyed elite
that we call the New World Order.

When Faction 2 realized that Clinton would never step down,  they
knew  that  they could only use the Nixon route to force him out.
They realized that this process would be a long protracted series
of checkmates and counter checkmates.  But they saw that as their
only alternative.

Faction 2 is based inside  Navy  Intelligence.  The Navy runs the
White House Communications Office.  I have known that  Faction  2
had pictures of Clinton in compromising positions ever since late
1996.   Faction  2  was  not  blackmailing him with these photos.
They simply used the photos and videos to direct their people who
are in Ken Starr's office.

Faction 2 really doesn't want  to expose Clinton for his dealings
with China, because if they  did,  a  whole  lot  more  would  be
exposed than anyone in the military wants the country to know.

They  also  did  not  want to expose him for his part in the drug
dealings because too many of them were involved in it.

Likewise for Whitewater.  The  entire  Savings  and Loan scam was
created by rogue elephants (not elements) within the  CIA.   They
did  this  to create a financial crisis that would bring down the
Federal Reserve and derail the New World Order.  Because of this,
they would not allow the whole Whitewater story to be told.

When the Israeli's decided to use  Monica Lewinsky to put Bill in
a blackmailable position, Faction 2 sided with them.   Faction  2
felt  that a sleazy sexual affair would so damage his credibility
that no one would ever be able to take him seriously again.

Faction 2 did  not  realize  how  the  New World Order controlled
media could shape his besmirched image and make him into a tragic
hero that the American people could still support.

However, this support is just about at its last legs.

The Removal of Newt as Speaker of the House
-------------------------------------------
At the time I was being given the information on how they planned
to get rid of Bill, I was told that the final scene of  the  play
would  be  the  removal  of  Newt  Gingrich.   Gingrich has to be
removed because when Bill  is  removed,  Al Gore will follow very
quickly.

Gore is refusing to resign like Agnew did.  If Gore had agreed to
go this way, then probably Jay Rockefeller  would  have  replaced
him,  agreed to pardon Bill and Hillary a la George Bush's pardon
of Casper  Weinberger,  and  then  ascend  to  the  Office of the
Presidency.

But because Al Gore  refuses  to  resign,  that  means  that  the
President  and  the  Vice  President  may be replaced in one fell
swoop.  If this happens, Newt Gingrich would be President.

Faction 2 despises Newt  Gingrich  as  much  as they despise Bill
Clinton.  They believe he is nothing but a New World Order toady.

But there is another fly in the soup that needs to be mentioned.

George Bush, The Elder
----------------------
Back in 1992, I was informed that George Bush was ordered to lose
the election.  He refused, and Ross Perot was brought in to split
the vote.  According to my sources, Perot has been  a  long  time
Navy  Intelligence  asset.   I  have  never  been  able  to get a
straight answer from my Sources as  to whether he is Faction 2 or
Faction 3, the Rogue Elephant faction.  (People who use the  term
Rogue   Element,   simply   don't   know  what  Faction  3  calls
themselves.)

At the time they  told  me  George  Bush would lose the election,
they also told me that we may see him as President again.

Did you know that the Speaker of the House does not have to be  a
member  of  the House?  It can be anyone that the majority agrees
on.

Did you wonder about the  favorable  coverage of George Bush, the
ex-President by the national media?

Can you imagine how a year 2000 election, with  George  W.  Bush,
Jr.,  running  for  President,  would  go  if his father were the
sitting President?  (Do you remember the press making a big point
of 1/8th of the country being governed by Bush brothers?  If this
happens, a Bush  family  dynasty  will  be  created.   There is a
fourth Bush brother.  He is very well hidden.  Why?  And I am not
talking about Neal.)

When I was told that George Bush, the  elder,  might  be  brought
back  as  President,  I refused to consider it.  It was a "Rumor"
that even Rumor Mill News couldn't  buy.  But in light of what is
going on in the  media  and  in  the  House  of  Representatives,
stranger things could happen.

But, there is still another fly in the anointment.  If Faction 2,
(who  made  an  alliance  with  George  Bush about a year ago) is
successful in getting him elected  as Speaker of the House, there
is a backup plan for Clinton.

If Gore is made to realize  that  his holding out will not do him
any good and may very well destroy the Democratic party's chances
for victory in 2000, then he will step down if  he  is  convinced
that  a  "trial" in the House will clear his name.  If he doesn't
agree to go this way,  then  he will be threatened with violence,
similar  to  what  occurred  to  his  son  in  1988,  when   Gore
prematurely ran for President.

Clinton's Back Up Plan
----------------------
The  back  up  plan  for  Clinton,  will be to have Gore agree to
pardon him  if  Clinton  agrees  to  step  down.   Then Gore will
appoint Jimmy Carter as a care taker President, and he will  step
down  and  face  a  "prerigged" House inquiry.  This inquiry will
exonerate him of all wrongs,  at  least  this  is what he will be
told.  And this will make him eligible to run for the  Presidency
in the year 2000.

As usual, the  best  laid  plans  of  mice  and  men sometimes go
astray.

There are things that can still come out  on  Clinton  that  will
permanently  destroy  him  and  his wife.  Hillary is planning on
moving to  California  and  running  for  Diane Feinstein's seat,
which will be up in the year 2000.  To do this, she must take  up
residency  here  in California very soon.  She must also keep the
lid on the mess that  can  forever  ruin  her  in the eyes of the
American people.

Hillary will force Bill to resign, and it will be within time for
Hillary to move to California and run for office.  Bill  will  be
offered  a position in Hollywood as the head of a major studio or
as a highly paid advisor.

Now the question should be, what will be the reason the President
gives for his resignation.  You  should know by now that whatever
story he tells us won't be the real story.  It will be  one  that
allows  him  to  leave office, and within a short period of time,
and rehabilitate himself.

But Faction 2 does not want  him to rehabilitate himself too far.
They don't want  another  elder  statesman  like  Richard  Nixon.
Therefore,  it  is  my belief that he will be forced to step down
because of his compulsive sexual addictions.

Unfortunately, it is also  my  belief  that  he will die an early
death, either from AIDS, or from a drug overdose.

Bill Clinton knows where all the bodies are buried.   His  secret
police has supplied him with enough information on every powerful
person  in the world, that he could literally retire to an island
and still run the world through blackmail.  Faction 2 won't allow
this to happen.

When he resigns, he will be given a very flashy job in Hollywood.
His cocaine habit will then be  supplied on a regular basis.  And
one day, we will read that Bill Clinton has  gone  the  route  of
John Belushi.

Politics  world wide is not what it used to be.  It is controlled
from behind the scenes  by  the  two  factions that are vying for
control of the world.  We know about Faction 1.  We call them the
new world order.  But we do not know anything  about  Faction  2,
the shadow men who also have a plan for a world government.  When
these two factions fight each other, there are causalities.

>From  what  I  have  been told, there is no way that Bill Clinton
will survive.  He may be told he  can fake his death and live out
his life under an assumed identity.  But his  handlers  know  him
too  well.  He is sneaky enough to try to use his stash of secret
files.  Therefore, they may  promise  him  this, but just when he
thinks he is safe... two to three years down the  road,  he  will
suddenly disappear, and no one will be any the wiser.

There  is  only  one  way  for  him  to stay alive.  And this way
depends on how much he loves Chelsea.

This is still developing.
