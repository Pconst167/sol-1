ROME VS. THE GRAIL: WHAT IS "THINKING"?
=======================================

In the ninth century, Pope  Nicholas  I declared that "man was no
longer to be considered as  a  trichotomy  of  Spirit,  Soul  and
Body."   [1]  The  Papal  See  denied  "the very existence of the
Individual Human Spirit, declaring  man  to  be but body and soul
and relegating the personal spirit to the lowly estate of a  mere
'intellectual  quality'  within the soul itself.  In this way the
spiritual initiative of Western Man was confined to the prison of
three-dimensional awareness of the sense world, and the Dogmas of
the  Roman  Church   became   the   only   recognized  source  of
revelation."  [2] Before, the individual had been deemed  capable
of   finding  answers  from  "within."   Pope  Nicholases  ruling
re-defined the situation:  the Roman Church stood as intermediary
between God and man; it told man what God said; the Church became
the middleman between  man  and  God.  (Today's  middleman is the
"expert,"  who  is  supposedly  more  qualified  to  think.   The
"expert" is intermediary between Truth and the individual -- =but
the individual allows this to happen=.)

It can be seen how the new definition of  God's  relationship  to
man  just  so  happened  to  put the Roman Church in an extremely
powerful position.  ("God  says  do  this.   God  says do that.")
Opposing Nicholases dethronement of the individual  human  spirit
was   "Grail   Christianity."    The   word  "Grail"  comes  from
"graduale," meaning "gradually" or  "step  by step."  The "search
for the Grail" denoted  an  initiation  process  which  gradually
developed the inner life.  The process involved "the awakening of
a dullard from an unthinking stupor." [3]

Pope  Nicholases  ninth-century  declaration "brought about man's
scepticism regarding the spiritual  validity of thinking...  From
thence forward, because Spirit  had  been  relegated  to  a  mere
shadowy  intellectual quality in the soul, thinking was no longer
trusted as a means to truth." [4]

It has probably happened  to  you  that  first, you thought about
some problem, then later, "out of nowhere,"  the  answer  to  the
problem  suddenly  "came  to  you."  You have been led to presume
that such answers originate in a mysterious area of your material
brain called "The  Unconscious."   This "Unconscious," presumably
nothing more than a  "mode  of  matter  in  motion,"  nonetheless
delivers  startlingly original ideas.  "Where do you come up with
these ideas?"  I am sometimes  asked.   (Maybe you also have been
asked such a question.)  My answer is that the  ideas  come  from
"someplace  else."   By  "someplace  else" is not meant "modes of
matter in motion"  located  in  the  Unconscious MysteryLand.  My
"MysteryLand" exists in either a  different  plane  or  different
dimension.

Thinking  is a telepathic transmission to "someplace else."  When
you suddenly "get an idea,"  that  is a telepathic reception from
"someplace  else."   Beware  however  that  not  all   telepathic
receptions  are  necessarily  to  be trusted.  An idea that "pops
into your head" may  or  may  not  turn  out  to be true.  If you
consult with other "thinkers" (transmitters)  --  either  through
conversation  or  the  written  word -- and they also corroborate
your "thoughts" (receptions), then you are on more solid ground.
