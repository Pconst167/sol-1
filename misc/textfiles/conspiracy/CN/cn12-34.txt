NEW YORK TIMES WEB SITE HACKED?
-------------------------------
But New York Times Apparently Fails To Report Security Breach
-------------------------------------------------------------

Conspiracy Nation made an http  connection  to the New York Times
web site on Sunday, 9/13/98.   To  our  surprise,  we  found  the
message  (below)  which  we  captured  into a "log" file.  To our
greater surprise, New York Times  has apparently failed to report
on the breach in its security.

PO3TRY FOR Y0U:^F ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

wether you believe it or coff
we at HFG hate john markoff
to the new writer matt
we say "at least you're not a rat"
for  some reason john hates mitnick
even when tsutomu is the real big dick
while shimmy is no beginner to crime
kevin  is  the one doing his time
hanging here at new york times
is the best place to sling our rhymes
poor journalism these guys have the knack
which explains the good security they lack
we busted root on their women and their suns
next thing you know, we'll be looking for nuns
in our short absence we leave you this thought
at  least  the  good  fight  was fought!
