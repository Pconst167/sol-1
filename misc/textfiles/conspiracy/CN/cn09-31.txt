GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]
 
[...continued...]
 
  Recently,  in  a  television  appearance,  Pat Carbine, now
  publisher of Ms. [magazine]  and formerly editor of McCalls
  [magazine] in 1971 when  that magazine named Gloria Steinem
  "Woman of the Year," declared that the Women's Movement was
  currently  in  "Phase  II."   What that means here (the Red
  Stockings  go  on to explain), "radicals were necessary for
  getting  the  thing  started,"  she  conceded,   "but   the
  moderates were now in control."
 
(And skipping down still further, the article closes here with an
interesting little blurb.)
 
  Do  not forget that Gloria Steinem dated Henry Kissinger at
  one time.   And  think  about  this:   "There  is still the
  assumption that a woman is not a complete  human  being  by
  herself.  We have to consider the ways in which we are 'man
  junkies.'"
 
(That from Gloria Steinem in a New York Times interview of August
11, 1974.)
 
Well   the   Kissinger   association   is  not  necessarily  very
significant at all.  However we  *are*  going to talk about a man
that she's been with for a very long time who  appears  to  be  a
very insidious individual indeed.
 
Perhaps  none  of  the  things  in any of the material that we're
gonna present here, taken by themselves, would be too conclusive.
However the  intersection  of  all  of  them  is  very intriguing
indeed. 
 
Now reviewing some of  the  key  points  of  this  Berkeley  Barb
article:    The   Independent  Research  Service,  founded  to  a
considerable extent by Gloria Steinem  and co-directed by her for
quite  some  time,  was  involved  with  basically  breaking   up
socialist  youth  conferences and disrupting them abroad, as well
as reporting on the affiliations  of some of the people involved.
That is obviously the kind of activity CIA does engage  in.   And
one  of the most interesting things is the role of Clay Felker in
boosting Steinem's career and helping to get Ms. started, because
Felker was an associate of  Steinem's in the Independent Research
Service.  Katherine Graham here played a key  role  in  launching
Ms.,  and  then  a  sort  of  symbiotic  relationship between Ms.
[magazine] and Steinem and Newsweek followed from that.
 
We're gonna take  a  look  at  Katherine  Graham  --  her and the
Washington Post's long-standing affiliation with CIA as  well  as
role in Watergate -- a little later in the broadcast.
 
It's also worth noting that (as the article here points out) some
corporations  which  have  sort  of  dubious  policies,  at least
abroad, have been very prominent Ms. advertisers.  I think people
who would like to find out more  about IT&T should take a look at
IT&T's role in the Chilean coup of 1973.  And then  examine  some
of  the  Amnesty  International reports on what happened to women
political prisoners under  Pinochet's  regime.   One  of the most
grotesque  things  that  I  recall   reading   in   the   Amnesty
International  reports about the political repression and torture
under  Pinochet  immediately  after  the  overthrow  of  Salvador
Allende in Chile, was that  female political prisoners were often
subjected to torture by specially trained dogs  who  would  first
rape  them,  and  then  sexually  mutilate  them.   Although  Ms.
[magazine]  does  not  appear  to  have too much hesitation about
running ads by an  organization  that would help precipitate that
kind of activity, I suspect that if Gloria Steinem were tied down
onto a Chilean torture table getting the "once over" from "Fido,"
I expect her attitude would be somewhat less circumspect than  it
was under the circumstances.
 
And  last, but certainly not least, it's interesting to note that
she dated Henry  Kissinger.   Of  course  Kissinger was very much
involved in setting up that very same coup, as was Richard  Helms
(part  of the Washington Post orbit.)  We're going to take a look
at another interesting fellow, though, that Gloria Steinem dated.
Again:  one doesn't want to damn people by association.  But when
you're  examining  intelligence   connections,   the  people  one
associates with intimately and over a long period of time are one
of the indicators of where one's real sympathies lie.
 
We're now going to play a short section of the "One Step  Beyond"
show  from  June  17th, 1984.  You're going to hear some material
here from Newsweek magazine,  as  well  as some material from the
New York Times.  And  it's  going  to  be  talking  about  Gloria
Steinem's  paramour  for  the past, what...  It was nine years in
'84.  I don't know whether  they're  still together, but that's a
long time to be with anybody in terms of a  dating  relationship.
Gloria  Steinem's  relationship  with  a  man  named  J.  Stanley
Pottinger, who J. Stanley Pottinger is, some of the things he has
been  involved  in,  is  the next thing we're going to take up in
relation to Gloria Steinem and the whole Ms. axis.
 
Playing now from "One Step Beyond," June 17th, 1984.
 
  An interesting bit  of  information  here concerning Gloria
  Steinem.  And again:  this on  the  occasion  of  her  50th
  birthday.   This  is  from Newsweek, the issue of June 4th,
  1984.   There's  an   article   on  Gloria  Steinem's  50th
  birthday.  It's very short.  It's entitled, "Steinem at 50:
  Gloria in Excelsis."  (And I'm only going to read  you  one
  sentence of this article.)
 
  "In  previous  incarnations,  Steinem  dated  Mike Nichols,
  Rafer Johnson, and other notables.  For the past nine years
  she has been romantically involved with Washington attorney
  Stanley  Pottinger,  a   Republican  and  former  Assistant
  Attorney General for Civil Rights."
 
  But he was Assistant  Attorney  General  for  Civil  Rights
  under  the Nixon/Ford administration, from 1973 until 1977.
  You'll all recall what Nixon's Justice Department was like:
  both Mr.  Kleindeist  and  John  Mitchell  were indicted --
  Mitchell convicted and Kleindeist  eventually...   I  don't
  know  whether  he  was  convicted  and received a suspended
  sentence, or whether he eventually was acquitted.  But half
  the Nixon Justice Department wound up being indicted on one
  charge  or  another,  many   of  them  acquitted,  most  in
  connection with the Watergate affair.  They  also  presided
  over  COINTELPRO  and a number of other interesting things.
  Surely the Nixon administration  has never been regarded as
  a great champion of civil rights.  And a woman like  Gloria
  Steinem,  who  is  at  least nominally aligned with a civil
  rights  movement,  the   feminist  movement...   Well,  her
  association,  her  9-year  romantic  involvement  with  Mr.
  Pottinger, is really intriguing.
 
  Now  those  of  you  who  listen  to  Mae Brussell's "World
  Watcher" series will recall  Mae  referring very briefly to
  Mr. Pottinger's [alleged] involvement in an arms  smuggling
  scam.   (Research  credit for the following article, again,
  goes to Mr. Ted Rubenstein.)
 
  (By the way, that Newsweek article, if you'd like  to  look
  it up, is from June 4th, 1984.)
 
  Now,  concerning  Mr. Pottinger and his alleged involvement
  in an arms smuggling  scam, the following article (research
  credit goes to Ted Rubenstein)...  This  is  from  the  New
  York Times of June 3rd, 1984.  This is an article by Solwyn
  Rabb,  headlined  "Iranian  is  Sought in Inquiry on Arms."
  Subtitled:   "Banker  Wanted  in  Smuggling  of  Prohibited
  Equipment."
 
  "An Iranian banker in  New  York  City  who offered to help
  seek the release of the American hostages in Iran  in  1980
  is under investigation for leading a group that purportedly
  smuggled  banned military equipment into Iran, according to
  federal authorities.  The  investigation,  which began four
  years ago, resulted in the arrests in New York  last  month
  of  the  brother  of  the  banker and of a Huntington, Long
  Island  businessman  on  smuggling  charges.   According to
  federal  officials,  a  former  United   States   Assistant
  Attorney  General,  W.  Stanley  Pottinger,  is  also under
  investigation.  The 44-year-old  Mr.  Pottinger, who was in
  charge  of  the  Civil  Rights  Division  in  the   Justice
  Department from 1973 to 1977, recently testified before the
  federal grand jury in Manhattan investigating the case.  He
  did not return telephone calls left at his Manhattan office
  or his home."
