SEVEN MORE MONICA LEWINSKYS
===========================
And Monica's Seven More Bill Clintons
-------------------------------------

In the previous issue of Conspiracy Nation, coverage was given to
a report that six additional  women, besides Monica Lewinsky, had
been  implicated  as  sex  partners  of  Bill  Clinton.   This is
corroborated  in  a  report   by   Ambrose   Evans-Pritchard,   a
highly-regarded reporter with the London Telegraph newspaper.  In
the  Feb.  12,  1998 issue of the Telegraph, Evans-Pritchard ends
his story by  noting  that  Whitewater  prosecutor Ken Starr "has
already issued subpoenas for six depositions taken in  the  Paula
Jones lawsuit."

But Evans-Pritchard's story adds  one  more  name  to the list of
those being called upon by Independent Prosecutor  Starr:   Robyn
Dickey, the former White  House  Director of Special Projects and
Special Needs.  She, says the British reporter, "was named  as  a
long-standing  lover of President Clinton in Paula Jones's sexual
harassment lawsuit."  Robyn Dickey is the mother of Helen Dickey,
who phoned the Arkansas Governor's mansion late in the  afternoon
of  July  20,  1993, and frantically exclaimed that "Vince Foster
has just shot himself in the White House parking lot!"

                 -+- Sisterhood Is Powerful -+-

Reportedly the last known person to have seen Vince Foster  alive
was  Linda  Tripp,  then working at the bacchanalian White House.
Linda Tripp, for some reason,  was  a hold-over employee from the
previous Bush White House.  Prior to that, Ms. Tripp  worked  for
Delta  Force  at  Fort  Bragg, North Carolina (1988-1989) and for
U.S. Army  intelligence  at  Fort  Meade,  Maryland (1987).  Also
having interesting spy connections is Lucianne Goldberg,  Tripp's
literary  agent  who  urged  Tripp to secretly tape conversations
with Monica Lewinsky.  In 1972,  Ms. Goldberg was paid $1,000 per
week by Republicans to spy  on  Democrats.   And  also  a  highly
privileged  insider  has  been Monica Lewinsky herself, granted a
"Top Secret"  clearance  as  well  as  a "Sensitive Compartmented
Information"  clearance.   (Source:    Human   Events   magazine,
2/13/98)   Tripp,   Goldberg,   and  Lewinsky  all  belong  to  a
loosely-based   Feminist   Intelligence   Network   (FIN),  which
parallels  and  intersects  other  intelligence  networks.  Elite
Feminists have decided that, no matter what, they must  all  lock
arms and stand behind Bill Clinton, because they perceive Hillary
Clinton  as their "ace in the hole" who can greatly influence the
powerful U.S. President.  One  of  the  unique tools available to
this covert power clique of upper-crust women is the granting and
witholding of sexual favors to men, based on whether or  not  the
men  kowtow  to Elite Feminist dictates.  ("Suck my toe, slave.")
After Bill Clinton survives the  current InternGate mess, he will
be consigned to the permanent dog-house, and  Queen  Bee  Hillary
will  be  "wearing  the  pants"  from  there  on in.  *Cui bono*?
Secret Feminist agents Goldberg, Tripp, and Lewinsky, and all the
rest of the Sisterhood.

             -+- Monica's Other "Bill Clinton's"? -+-

So  now there are =seven= more "Monica Lewinskys" (six plus Robyn
Dickey).  Where will it  end?   One  New York tabloid carried the
screaming headline recently that,  "There  Were  Hundreds!"   And
Arkansas  trooper  L.D.   Brown,   a   long-time   bodyguard   of
then-Governor  Clinton, has put the count at "about one-hundred."
("I want to grow up, to be a politician," sang the 60s rock band,
The Byrds.  Now we know why.)

But  what  about  Monica  Lewinsky  herself?   Supposedly she was
heartbroken when she  learned  that  her colleague, Bill Clinton,
was cheating on  her;  that  President  Bill  had  other  "Monica
Lewinskys."   Yet  according  to  the  latest  issue  of The Star
(02/17/98), Monica herself  may  not  have  been  faithful to her
purported "true love," Scaramouche Bill.  Then again, it  may  be
that  Ms. Lewinsky, in a jealous rage, lashed back at Bill in the
only  way  she  knew  how,  by flaunting other lovers at the U.S.
President.   The  Star,  at   any  rate,  reports  on  Lewinsky's
"numerous post-White  House  sexual  encounters"  with  "Pentagon
officials  and  military officers," suggesting that both Bill and
Monica are free spirits, grabbing the gusto that life offers.

                -+- A Clinton Lovers Count -+-

A new count, a running tally, may be a good idea.  We've  had  an
ongoing   "Clinton   Body  Count,"  a  continual  update  on  the
statistically interesting number of sudden, violent deaths linked
to the Woodstock  President.   Now,  it  seems, a "Clinton Lovers
Count" is a good project.  But it may be that President  Bill  is
about  to  change  his  ways.  The Star reports that Bill Clinton
"has secretly begun therapy for sexual addiction."  If the report
is true, Conspiracy Nation  wishes  the President well.  And when
he's lying on the couch and  free-associating  for  his  analyst,
certain  phallic  symbols  could  erupt  out  of the presidential
psyche -- like missiles, for  example.  In time, Bill Clinton may
be cured of his obvious compulsions, and this could be good  news
for the people of Iraq -- especially since Mr. Clinton  signed  a
Presidential   Decision   Directive   (PDD)   in  November  which
authorizes the  use  of  tactical  nuclear  weapons against Iraq.

In  the  meantime,  it's  nice to know the U.S. President has not
been working too  hard.   Besides  enjoying relaxing moments with
the  opposite  sex,  Bill  enjoys   frequent   golf   games   and
oral-satisfactions  like  giving  speeches to potential political
money-donors.   And,  too,  Hillary   is  frequently  around  for
stimulating late-night chats.
