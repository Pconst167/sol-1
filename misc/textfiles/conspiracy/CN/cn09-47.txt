GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]
 
[...continued...]
 
In a miscellaneous  archive  show  entitled  "Gloria in Excelsis"
(subtitled "The CIA, the Women's Movement, and the News  Media"),
Gloria  Steinem's  many  intelligence  contacts were described in
considerable depth.  The  main  intersection  between Steinem and
the CIA is  Steinem's  role  as  co-founder,  and  at  one  point
director,  of  an  organization  called  the Independent Research
Service:  this is a  CIA-financed  student organization which has
been used in a number of different  capacities.   We  also  noted
that  Ms.  magazine itself, which had Steinem as editor, has as a
principal stockholder Katherine  Graham  of  the Washington Post.
The  Graham  publishing  empire,  and  the  Washington  Post   in
particular,  [are]   inextricably   linked   with   the   Central
Intelligence  Agency,  as we looked at in the book *Katherine the
Great* by Debra Davis.  It  should  also  be noted that the first
publisher of Ms. magazine was a woman  named  Elizabeth  Forsling
Harris, who arranged many of the key Dallas details for President
Kennedy's motorcade route.
 
By way of further  exploring  Gloria  Steinem's CIA background --
specifically, her role with the Independent Research  Service  --
we're  gonna take a look at some information now which comes from
a book entitled *The Pied Piper* (subtitled "Allard K. Lowenstein
and the Liberal Dream.")  This  was authored by Richard Cummings.
The book was published in hardcover by Grove Press, Inc., in  New
York. And it's copyright 1985.
 
Of  Gloria  Steinem  and  her  involvement  with  the Independent
Research Service, and in  turn the Independent Research Service's
involvement with disrupting the Vienna Youth Festival (which  had
very   strong  Socialist  and  Communist  participation),  author
Cummings writes as follows:
 
  The Independent Service for Information on the Vienna Youth
  Festival, which was  technically  founded by Gloria Steinem
  and Paul Sigmund,  and  which  came  to  be  known  as  the
  Independent   Research   Service,   was   funded   by   the
  Independence  Foundation,  one of the conduits of CIA funds
  into the National Students  Association [NSA].  In 1965, it
  was the  Independence  Foundation  which  leased  its  posh
  offices   in  Washington  to  the  NSA  [National  Students
  Association], signing a 15-year rent-free agreement.
 
  The Independent  Service  diligently  recruited hundreds of
  American students to attend the 1959  Vienna  festival  and
  later,  the  1962  Communist-backed  Helsinki  festival, to
  oppose the Communists as vigorously as possible.  According
  to  Eugene  Theroux,   who   served   as  chairman  of  the
  metropolitan New York region chapter of NSA  in  1958,  the
  Americans went "to cause trouble."
 
I  would  note  here  also,  more  about  the  activities  of the
Independent   Research   Service,    the   CIA-financed   student
organization, co-founded by Gloria Steinem.  And we're gonna look
at, in addition to the glance we just  took  at  the  Independent
Research  Service's  work  in disrupting not only the 1959 Vienna
festival but also the  1962  Helsinki festival,  we're gonna look
at plans of some  of  these  same  elements  and  individuals  to
disrupt a conference that had been scheduled for Algeria in 1965.
This  conference was cancelled.  But had it not been cancelled it
might very well have been  disrupted by the aforementioned Eugene
Theroux.  And one of the people who is  aiding  Theroux  was  the
aforementioned  Allard  Lowenstein, a former Dean of Students for
Stanford University, and Gloria  Steinem  presiding over the same
mileau once again.
 
Turning again to  Richard  Cummings,  *The  Pied  Piper*  (Allard
Lowenstein and the Liberal Dream), we find,
 
  Another  Communist-backed youth festival was planned by the
  IUS for the summer of  1965 in Algiers, and Lowenstein made
  preparations to go there in order to disrupt it.   Planning
  to  join  him this time was Paul Theroux's brother, Eugene,
  who as a NSA  leader  in  1958  had met Lowenstein and been
  inspired by him to work on behalf of southwest  Africa  and
  black  students  in  the  south.   Eugene  Theroux had been
  recruited in 1965 by  Gloria  Steinem  to  work for the CIA
  front, Independent Research Service.  They were to be  part
  of  a delegation to "cause trouble," as Theroux puts it, or
  to "engage people in debate," as he corrects himself.
 
And again, as noted, the 1965  conference never came off.  But we
find some of the same elements:  Lowenstein, Steinem, Theroux, et
al., planning to disrupt this conference as  they  had  the  1962
Helsinki conference and the 1959 conference in Vienna as well.
 
It should be noted that a number of other prominent liberals have
intersected with this same mileau, this CIA mileau which involves
Gloria  Steinem.   Among those are William Sloan Coffin(sp?), one
of the leaders of the  anti-war movement, himself a chaplain from
Yale University, himself also, for several years,  a  CIA  agent.
We  took a look at William Sloan Coffin and his intersection with
the CIA in  discussions  from  the  book,  *The  Man Who Kept the
Secrets*  (about  Richard  Helms.)   That's  authored  by  Thomas
Powers.  William Sloan Coffin's CIA background  described  there.
As  we  shall  see,  William  Sloan  Coffin intersecting with the
mileau  involving  people  like   Allard  Lowenstein  and  Gloria
Steinem and, as we shall see, current  Massachusetts  congressman
Barney  Frank,  who  also  worked  with  Gloria  Steinem  and the
CIA-sponsored Independent Research Service.
 
Returning once again to *The Pied Piper*, by Richard Cummings.
 
  It is known that  the  CIA  had  established centers on the
  campuses  of many American universities.  In his recruiting
  efforts  at  some  of  these  universities,  Lowenstein was
  working with people who had been affiliated with the CIA or
  had participaated in CIA-sponsored projects.  William Sloan
  Coffin at Yale, whom Lowenstein wanted to head  the  summer
  project,  had  worked for the CIA.  Barney Frank at Harvard
  had been with  the  Independent Research Service delegation
  to Helsinki, an operation which, by Frank's own  admission,
  he  clearly  understood  was CIA-backed.  Frank jokes about
  the  role  of  fellow  delegate  Gloria  Steinem,  whom  he
  describes as running around at nightclubs set up by the CIA
  in  Helsinki,  helping  to   win  over  Africans  from  the
  Communists.
 
And again, this little section here  is  going  to  go  into  the
aforementioned  miscellaneous  archive show, "Gloria in Excelsis:
CIA, the Women's Movement, and  the News Media."  That is already
on file with Archives on Audio [PO Box 170023, San Francisco,  CA
94117-0023;  phone:   415-346-1840].  And this particular section
of the  program  is  going  to  go  in  as  an  addendum  to that
particular broadcast.
