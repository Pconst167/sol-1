TRENDS 2000
===========
Futurist Foresees Trouble Ahead
-------------------------------

(Washington, 12/24/97) -- Author  Gerald Celente appeared briefly
on C-Span this morning.  He has written  a  book  called  *Trends
2000*, just now coming out in paperback.

With a major worldwide economic crisis rumbling in the background
this holiday season,  Celente's  observations are noteworthy.  He
says that the so-called "economic boom" of  the  1990s  has  been
"based on cheap money, just like the 1920s."  The Federal Reserve
printing presses are rolling, night and day, pumping up the money
supply.    Banks  are  crawling  on  their  knees,  ringing  your
doorbell, and begging you to  take their credit cards.  Inflation
exists, but it is a focused inflation, for example in  the  stock
market and in automobile and house prices.

Conspiracy  Nation says, watch Russia as the next economic domino
to fall.

"Never before have  so  many  people  lost  confidence in so many
institutions  simultaneously,"  says  Celente.   In  the   United
States, there is a growing dichotomy between its citizens and the
denizens  of  the  "lunatic loop," Washington, DC.  These trends,
says the  C-Span  guest,  "will  evolve,  but  some  of  them are
happening very quickly." (Very quickly indeed, like =right  now=,
as the economic bubble deflates like a collapsed lung.)

Celente,  founder  and director of the Trends Research Institute,
notes the growing  gap  between  haves  and have-nots.  "This gap
between the rich and the poor is really going to change  the  way
society  lives."  He foresees a new housing trend, "communalism."
Increasingly, people will live  together  not  based on family or
emotional attachments but as a way to save money on rent.  In the
"good economy" ("good" for =some=), fewer are choosing  to  marry
and  raise  a  family:  they can't afford it.  "There are as many
single households  in  the  United  States  as  there are married
couples with children," says Celente.

Possible good news is a move away from fossil fuels, such as oil.
"We believe there's going to  be  an  alternative  energy  source
developing  very  shortly,  sooner  rather  than later," says the
futurist.   "Something  to  take   us  away  from  fossil  fuels,
something not very obvious, and  it's  against  the  conventional
wisdom of the day."

But  in general, the outlook is bad.  "We're going to be facing a
crisis of proportions we've never  seen before."  And how well is
our "watchdog press" informing us?  Not very well, says  Celente.
He points out the prevalence of "junk news":  "Everyone knows the
name  of  Clinton's dog.  We know all about Jon Benet Ramsey.  We
know all about the life of  O.J.  Simpson, and on and on.  But in
the meantime, people are not seeing the  current  events  forming
the  future  trends.  I'll give you an example.  On July 18th, we
were doing some work with  the Xerox corporation.  And they asked
us, 'How do you track trends?' And we  picked  up  the  newspaper
that  day,  and  we  said,  'Here.   Look through the paper.  You
=won't= find  this  as  a  headline  story:   The  Currencies Are
Beginning To Unravel Throughout Southeast  Asia.'  Instead,  that
day,  CNN  announced that they were going to be at the auction of
O.J. Simpson's house.  So this  is  what's happening to the news!
This is what they call 'news.' And they say it with a high  level
of  arrogance  too, that 'This is the news.' It's not news!  It's
junk!"

Further signs  of  trouble  are  in  the  political  arena.  Says
Celente, "In politics, everyone knows that we no  longer  have  a
representative  form of government.  They feel that government is
bought by special interests.  I'm from the Bronx, originally.  So
what they call 'soft money,' we call 'bribes.'"

"We're going to see a new 'ism' develop.  Right now, the world is
overbalanced with what  we  call  'capitalism.'  And  now, as all
these economies begin to unravel, you can also bet  that  there's
going  to be a lot of political unrest.  We're going to see a new
'ism' develop.  In many countries,  look for a different shade of
red, a new type of communism.  Not like the  old  communism,  but
something to replace the one-system.  Because these economies are
not going to hold up. There's going to be a counter-balance."
