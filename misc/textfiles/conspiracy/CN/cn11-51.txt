THE INVISIBLE COLLEGE
=====================

  Way back in  the  "dark  ages"  of science, when scientists
  themselves were suspected  of  being  in  league  with  the
  Devil,   they  had  to  work  privately.   They  often  met
  clandestinely to exchange views,  and  the results of their
  various  experiments.   For  this   reason,   they   called
  themselves the Invisible College. [1]

Dr.  Jacques  Vallee,  encountering what he refers to as dogmatic
scientific skepticism, grew frustrated at the rigid, close-minded
attitude  of  supposed  "scientists."   He  knew  of professional
astronomers who, experiencing their own UFO sightings, refused to
go  public.   French   scientists   who   came   across   similar
manifestations  "thought  only  of suppressing the records."  [2]
Throughout the "scientific"  community  there was "the deliberate
destruction of scientific data." [3]

But  fortunately  for  true  science,  Dr.  Vallee  began  to  be
furtively contacted  by  professionals  who  secretly  sought  to
honestly  investigate.  In academia's climate of fear, they dared
not pursue the Truth openly, wherever  it might lead, for fear of
ridicule, ostracism, and the drying-up of funds.  But in the dead
of night they would sneak away to secret meeting places and share
ideas.   "This  group  has   grown   larger   over   the   years.
Whimsically,  it  calls  itself  the  'Invisible  College.'"  [4]
Unknown  and  unheralded, like the medieval monks of old they are
carrying the Lamp of Learning to the future, in this, our current
dark age.

But why the suppression of  open  inquiry into the UFO phenomena?
Astrophysicist Vallee, in his book *Dimensions*, points  out  the
religious   subtext   inherent   in   the  multiple,  unexplained
"sightings" which have  occurred  over  the  centuries.  From the
Virgin Mary, "hit by a mysterious beam of light" and subsequently
bearing a fatherless child, to Joseph Smith, visited by  a  light
like  unto  a  "consuming fire," to Fatima and a "globe of light"
witnessed  by   thousands,   there   is   an   angle  other  than
materialistic to these events.

The religious subtext explains why the official  Soviet  position
toward  the  manifestations  almost immediately solidified into a
strong  "Nyet."   The   "decadent   capitalists"  were  behind  a
psychological attack on "Communist  realism"  (atheism),  it  was
claimed. [5]

Here  in   the   USA,   where   "Democrat"   has   mutated   into
"Neo-Democrat,"  Marxism, especially on campus, has devolved into
Neo-Marxism.  In fact, Marxist  and  Democrat  have both cast off
their rough edges (like concern for workers) to form a new belief
system where the State is paramount and "God is dead."  (=God= is
not dead.  =Nietzche= is dead.)  God is always  superior  to  the
State,  which  is  why when a fellow like Nietzche or Freud comes
along, the State-controlled  "scholars"  will promote that fellow
to the "head of the class."  Another of the many  ways  in  which
the  State,  through  its  controlled  academics,  is pushing the
dethronement of  God  is  by  changing  the calendar nomenclature
"B.C."  (Before Christ) and "A.D."  (*Anno Domini*, "in the  year
of  our  Lord") to "B.C.E."  ("before the common era") and "C.E."
("common era").  This attack  on calendar nomenclature began when
"the Jacobins inaugurated the modern effort to create  a  Godless
social order in the French Revolution."  [6]

In my halcyon grad school  days,  belief  in  God marked one as a
"simpleton."  In that  oh-so-sophisticated  environment,  though,
there  was at least tolerance for professor-preachers of Freudian
atheism.  And this  is  some  (or  more)  of  the  reason why any
serious,  open  look  into   the   UFO   phenomena   receives   a
not-so-subtle  "thumbs  down"  in  academia.  UFOs, like God, are
disturbing to the ultra-logical, mechanistic, bureaucratic system
planned  by  the  emerging  Super  State.   UFOs,  like  God, are
inconvenient. And so, both are mocked. 

But secretly, in unknown locations, meets the Invisible College.
