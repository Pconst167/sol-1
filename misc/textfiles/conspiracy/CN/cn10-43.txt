FIELD MARSHAL STARR'S IRREGULARS
================================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
In  the  Whitewater   Affair,   the  first  Independent  Counsel,
appointed under a special law, was  Robert  Fiske.   But  he  had
serious  conflicts  of  interest,  such as his prior links to the
mysterious  espionage-assassination-linked  Bank  of  Credit  and
Commerce International (BCCI) linked to the Clinton gang.   Fiske
was replaced by Kenneth W. Starr.
 
In February  1977,  Starr  abruptly  announced  his  resignation.
Unmentioned:    Starr   feared   that  Bob  "Naval  Intelligence"
Woodward, of the Washington Post, was about to finger Starr as an
unregistered foreign lobbyist of the Red Chinese government -- so
Starr was himself subject  to  arrest.   Starr  is a lobbyist for
China  International  Trust  and  Investment  Corp.   (CITIC),  a
ministry level corporation owned by the  Chinese  government  and
reporting  directly to the State Council of the People's Republic
of China.
 
When reassured his secret would not appear in the monopoly press,
Starr scrapped his resignation  blurb  and  resumed his role as a
sort  of  Whitewater  Field  Marshal.   He  reportedly  has   150
intermediaries or surrogates.
 
Who are Field Marshal Starr's troops? And what do they do?
 
1.   They  are an army of irregulars.  Some, under assumed names,
are linked to the FBI.   One  such reportedly uses the name "John
Bennett,"  of  Jeremiah  Films,  Inc.  They  are  purportedly  an
ultra-right wing propaganda machine, highly profitably  appealing
to  the  hopes  and  fears  of  Americans  anguished by a central
government apparently run out of control.
 
2.  Others are linked to the State and County government units of
Arkansas and mostly other southern states.
 
3.  Still others are key officials, reportedly, of foreign secret
police stationed in North America.   They are not bothered by the
FBI or CIA who they occasionally assist.  One of them  reportedly
is  the  head  of the Red Chinese Secret Police, Te Wu, for North
America.   Strange  as  it   may   seem,  they  assist  Starr  in
counter-intelligence  against  foreign  and  domestic   so-called
"subversives,"   subject   to   the   vast   wire-tap  and  other
jurisdiction of a secret Federal Court operating, in the Beltway,
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978.
   A profound reason for Starr  covering  up the strange death --
some say murder -- of Clinton White House Deputy Counsel  Vincent
W.  Foster, Jr., involves espionage and treason by Foster and his
sidekick, Hillary  Rodham  Clinton,  in  selling  nuclear missile
tracking secrets to a foreign power.
 
4.  This is an army of experts  in  dirty  tricks.   Among  other
things,  they  reportedly  carry  out  "black bag" jobs, that is,
break and entry, theft of records, planting of fake incriminating
alleged   "documents,"   and   such.    They   maim   and  murder
"loudmouths," and create and carry out violence against so-called
"subversives," similar to the FBI's COINTEL Program of the  1960s
and 1970s, directed against civil rights activists and peaceniks.
(Among  those  targeted  by  the  FBI  for removal was Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.)
   They  assist  Starr,  reportedly,   to  obstruct  justice,  by
terrorizing or snuffing out supposedly "protected" federal  grand
jury witnesses.
 
5.   Some  of  Field  Marshal  Starr's  irregulars  have  a  long
background  of having assisted CIA, domestic and worldwide, under
cover of being "business  consultants."   They interface with the
traditional Mafia, Chicago, Detroit, and elsewhere.
 
6.  Starr's program is to cover  up  the  criminality  of  a  CIA
couple,  namely,  Bill  and  Hillary  Clinton.   She  and  Foster
assisted   CIA,  and  George  Bush,  in  supplying  chemical  and
biological  weapons  to  Iraq,   disguised  as  U.S.  Agriculture
Department subsidies, through the Atlanta branch of a bank, owned
in part by the Vatican, Banca Nazionale deLavoro (BNL), a twin of
BCCI.  Under the auspices of the CIA  Station  Chief  in  London,
Bill  Clinton from an early age spied on Peace Movement activists
in  Europe  and  was  able  to  obtain  a  secret  transcript  of
anti-Stalinist critics in Moscow.
 
7.  In the process of  Whitewater whitewash, Starr seeks to sweep
into scandal and jail relative nobodies, to make it seem like the
Field Marshal is doing some public good.
   Under his federal law-mandated authority, Field Marshal  Starr
is  supposed  to  investigate  Bill  and Hillary Clinton, and the
so-called "Whitewater" matter.  Starr so far is cleverly avoiding
the Clinton-George Bush  link  to  CIA  and  the  dope traffic by
sidestepping inquiry into the  matter  of  the  Mena  Airport  in
Arkansas.
 
Question:   As an unregistered foreign lobbyist for Red China, is
Starr assisting the American CIA with counter-intelligence spying
on the Chinese?  The  monopoly  press  does  not so far raise the
question and offer an answer.
 
Without apparent authority, Starr is reportedly assisting John D.
Rockefeller IV -- who calls himself "Jay" to be cute -- in trying
to blow open a vacancy in the Vice  Presidency.   Jay,  like  his
uncle  Nelson  did in 1975, hopes to be President, under the 25th
Amendment, without an election.  (In 1973, we were 6 months ahead
of the monopoly press in  discussing  a scenario of replacing the
entire White House  team,  starting  with  Vice  President  Spiro
Agnew,  facing  bribery  charges,  replaced  by  appointment, not
election, by  Gerald  Ford.   Upon  the  downfall  of Nixon, Ford
became President and appointed, not elected,  Nelson  Rockefeller
Vice  President.   In  1975,  three  failed genuine assassination
plots against Ford almost made Rockefeller President.)
 
To aid  Jay  Rockefeller,  itching  to  be  President  without an
election,  Field  Marshal  Starr's  army  of   "black   baggers,"
wiretappers,  and assassins have targeted Vice President Al Gore.
They reportedly claim to  have  a  taped conversation of unlawful
fund-raising and such by Gore.  Under the  new  digital  process,
however, who can be sure a tape has the voices and is what it may
sound  like  being?   Thus installed as Vice President, Jay would
push out Clinton and become President, without an election.
 
This is being  done  without  apparent  authorization, as usually
required  for  wire-tapping,  by  the  Attorney   General.    But
surveillance  on  a  total  basis can be authorized by the secret
Federal Court, under  the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
This on the theory that Al Gore, and his  father,  are  so-called
"communists"  or  "communist  sympathizers."  More well-informed,
sophisticated people ridicule the  idea  that the Gore family are
subversives, yet some ultra-right wing types  continue  to  label
them as such.
 
Some  continue  to  suspect  that the Attorney General, by way of
whitewashing Whitewater, would make some effort to fire or remove
Starr.  This would actually  assist  Starr to destroy records and
cover up his cover-up  of  Clinton  and  the  Clinton  gang.   It
appears  to  be a mistake to believe Starr really wants to expose
the Clinton gang.
 
Al Gore reportedly understands that  if this army of professional
dirty tricksters does not succeed in framing him, that  he  would
be  a  target  for  a  so-called  "accident,"  that is, political
assassination.
 
Gore has joined  with  a  small  group  in  the  U.S. military --
Admirals   and   Generals   --   who   vow   to   arrest    their
Commander-in-Chief   Clinton,   charging  him  with  treason  and
sedition such as, that Clinton  gave national security secrets to
the Red Chinese Secret Police, with  the  aid  and  blessings  of
Kenneth  W.  Starr,  an unregistered foreign lobbyist for the Red
Chinese.
 
One of those assisting Field  Marshal  Starr and the dirty tricks
teams reportedly has been  George  Stephanopolous,  once  Clinton
White  House  honcho.   George became a consultant to ABC-CIA, on
the Cokie Roberts Sunday Morning TV Network Show.  ["This Week"].
(In 1988-89, the CIA  subsidy  for  overseas  offices for TV News
networks  was  switched  from  CBS   to   ABC.    Such   overseas
"journalists"  are  CIA  vacuum pumps, gathering intelligence for
the spy agency.)
 
Among other items, Starr is covering up the mysterious 50 million
dollars of federal funds transferred  from Chicago to Little Rock
and then to a dope money laundry center.  This done to  cover  up
the  embezzlement  of  funds from Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan
for  which  Bill  and  Hillary  Clinton  are  subject  to federal
criminal prosecution.

COURTS, researching and disclosing certain instances of  judicial
corruption  and  political  murders.   Since  1971,  as editor of
updates of the  group's  work,  called  HOTLINE  NEWS, a 5-minute
recorded phone message, changed  several  times  per  week  --  a
regular  phone  call  --  (773)  731-1100.  Since 1991, a regular
participant, now moderator, of a  popular, public access cable TV
program, called "Broadsides", in Chicago and suburbs --  on  most

Internet on several websites; archives  of  his  stories  can  be
pulled up and printed out.  Also, on Internet, his stories appear
on  some  five  categories of news groups, such as alt.conspiracy
and alt.activism.  (See also http://www.shout.net/~bigred/cn.html

A few highlights of the group's work:  Caused the biggest bribery
scandal in U.S. history, the collapse  of  the  Illinois  Supreme
Court,  1969.   Investigation  of  the  sabotaged Watergate plane
crash, 1972-73.  12 Watergate  figures perished including Mrs. E.
Howard Hunt, wife of the Watergate burglar.  One of the first  to
comment on the Vice President Spiro Agnew bribery mess, resulting
in  his downfall, 1973.  Investigation and disclosure causing the
jailing for bribery of the highest level sitting federal judge in
American history, Chicago Federal Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.,
1973.  Touching  off  "Operation  Greylord,"  in  which  20 local
judges and 40 lawyers jailed for bribery, 1983-1993.
