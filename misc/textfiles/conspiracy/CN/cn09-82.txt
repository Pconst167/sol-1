SHERMAN SKOLNICK'S RECORDED MESSAGE
===================================
(December 9, 1996; Transcription by Conspiracy Nation)
------------------------------------------------------
 
Hi!   Sherman  Skolnick,  Citizens'  Committee  to  Clean  Up the
Courts, 9800 South Oglesby.
 
The major court corruption  is  in  the Federal Appeals Court, in
major cities, like Chicago.  The undisputed court record shows it
is day; the crooked panel of Appeals  Court  judges  says  it  is
night,  and  they  make a crooked ruling favoring a bank or large
corporate interest.
 
Hearing a lot of this are  key federal appeals judges in Chicago:
Chief Judge Richard A.  Posner  (office,  312-435-5806)  and  his
sidekick, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook (312-435-5808) -- both, once
law professors at Rockefeller's University of Chicago.  Posner, a
judge,   continues  to  reportedly  represent  that  university's
billion dollar  stock  portfolio  fund.   Posner  and Easterbrook
promote an unusual theory of law, called  "Economic  Efficiency."
That  is, an underdog should not be allowed, in court, to prevail
in discrimination and  other  damage suits against multi-national
pirates.  It hurts profits!
 
These two judges, and their gang, issue  rulings  falsifying  the
facts.   Such  as  in a big bucks anti-Trust case against Western
Union.  Some lawyers  were  nearly  destroyed  when they blew the
whistle.
 
In 1991, I was the only journalist at an  Appeals  Court  hearing
involving  the  records  of the Chicago branch of Italy's largest
bank:  Banca Nazionale del  Lavoro  [BNL],  owned  in part by the
Pope.  Afterwards, I interviewed two participants  who  confirmed
that  secret  records showed George Bush, then President, was the
private business partner of  Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi strongman.
They showed billions  of  dollars  of  oil  kick-backs  from  the
militarily-weak  producers  in  the  Persian Gulf.  It could have
been the largest  tax-evasion  case  in  U.S.  history -- against
George Bush!
 
Before his later ruling, the Bush Justice Department  leaked  out
details  that  Judge  Posner  had  taken bribes in 8 other cases.
(Being  on  the  ball,   we   already  knew  about  that.)   Once
blackmailed, Judge Posner ruled the BNL case  should  be  removed
from the courthouse.  Only one smaller newspaper ran my exclusive
story.
 
Before  becoming  a judge, Posner ran a litigation services firm.
In plain language, he  was  a  bagman  and  a fixer.  He was also
chief anti-Trust consultant to CBS.  Then, as judge,  he  refused
to  disqualify  himself in an important anti-Trust case involving
CBS.  Hey!  Guess who won!?
 
In the early 1970s, our work  led to the jailing, for bribery, of
Posner's predecessor, Chicago federal appeals judge Otto  Kerner,
Jr.  Since forming this group in 1963, I have been falsely jailed
for  contempt,  wheelchair  and  all,  by  corrupt  judges  who I
directly accused of bribery.  Judge Easterbrook, at the behest of
his crony, Chief Judge Posner, are ordering me and  an  associate
of mine to be barred from their court, the U.S. Court of Appeals,
7th  Circuit,  Chicago.   It  revolves  around  our case, where a
Mafia-linked sheriff, at gunpoint,  stopped our on-location cable
TV production.  We were making a video of  the  sheriff's  people
breaking  into  my  associate's  (Joseph  Andreuccetti)  home and
stealing our cable  TV  tapes  and  documents relating to federal
court corruption.
 
From what is happening, it appears  that  this  gang  of  crooked
federal  judges  and  bankers is preparing to falsely jail us for
contempt.  Public outcry can stop them.
 
If you know about other  examples  of corruption of Judges Posner
and Easterbrook and their mob, write to the Citizens Committee to
Clean Up the Courts, 9800 South Oglesby Ave., Chicago, IL  60617.

Mr.  Skolnick,  since  1963,   has  been  founder/chairman  of  a
public-interest  group,  CITIZENS'  COMMITTEE  TO  CLEAN  UP  THE
COURTS, researching and disclosing certain instances of  judicial
corruption  and  political  murders.   Since  1971,  as editor of
updates of the  group's  work,  called  HOTLINE  NEWS, a 5-minute
recorded phone message, changed  several  times  per  week  --  a
regular phone call -- (312) 731-1100.  (Area code may soon change
to  773.)  Since 1991, a regular participant, now moderator, of a
popular, public access cable  TV program, called "Broadsides", in
Chicago and suburbs -- on most every Monday evening  in  Chicago,
on   Channel   21  cable,  9  p.m.,  available  to  some  400,000
households.  His comments appear on Internet on several websites;
archives of his stories can be  pulled up and printed out.  Also,
on Internet, his stories appear on some five categories  of  news
groups,  such  as  alt.conspiracy  and  alt.activism.   (See also
http://www.shout.net/~bigred/cn.html and  see  also ftp.shout.net
pub/users/bigred) Office (8 a.m. to  midnight,  7  days):   (312)
375-5741.  9800 So. Oglesby Avenue, Chicago, IL 60617-4870.  Call
before  sending  FAX.   NOTE  THAT THE NEW AREA CODE, 773, WAS TO
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY NOW.   IF  312 AREA CODE FAILS, TRY AREA
CODE 773.  (After October 12, 1996, AREA CODE changes to 773.)
 
A few highlights of the group's work:  Caused the biggest bribery
scandal in U.S. history, the collapse  of  the  Illinois  Supreme
Court,  1969.   Investigation  of  the  sabotaged Watergate plane
crash, 1972-73.  12 Watergate  figures perished including Mrs. E.
Howard Hunt, wife of the Watergate burglar.  One of the first  to
comment on the Vice President Spiro Agnew bribery mess, resulting
in  his downfall, 1973.  Investigation and disclosure causing the
jailing for bribery of the highest level sitting federal judge in
American history, Chicago Federal Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.,
1973.  Touching  off  "Operation  Greylord,"  in  which  20 local
judges and 40 lawyers jailed for bribery, 1983-1993.
