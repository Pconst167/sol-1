BRITS OUT TO TRAP CLINTON IN FACEOFF WITH IRAN
==============================================
By Jeffrey Steinberg

(New Federalist, 08/12/96)

Aug.  6   (EIRNS)   --   A   collection   of  well-known  British
propagandists,  led  by  the  Hollinger   Corporation's   Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard,  are  agitating  for an American military strike
against Iran,  on  the  basis  of  "leaked  information" that the
Teheran regime was behind the recent car-bomb  attack  against  a
U.S.  military  housing complex in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and the
downing of  TWA  Flight  800.   The  mere  fact  that  all of the
reporters and terrorism "experts" pushing for a U.S.  retaliatory
strike  against Iran, are dedicated enemies of President Clinton,
ought to suggest that there is something rotten here.

In fact, the  drumbeat  for  American  action  against Teheran --
rather than London, which is the  real  command-center  of  world
terrorism today -- is, according to well-placed U.S. intelligence
sources,  part  of  a  British/Club  of  the Isles effort to draw
President Clinton into a  geopolitical  trap in the Persian Gulf,
on the eve of the American Presidential elections.

Writing in the Aug. 4 Sunday Telegraph, Clinton-basher  Pritchard
claimed  that "the U.S. are making detailed plans for missile and
bombing strike [sic]  against  Iran,  because  they are convinced
that Iran was  involved  in  the  bombing  of  the  Saudi  Arabia
barracks."  Pritchard quoted another leading enemy of the Clinton
Presidency,  neo-conservative  operator  Kenneth  Timmerman,  who
claimed  that  Iran  was behind the TWA 800 crash, and that "more
aircraft are going to fall out of the sky."

For Pritchard and Timmerman to cast blame on Iran for the TWA 800
crash,  when  investigators  have  so   far  failed  to  turn  up
definitive forensic evidence that the  downing  was  a  terrorist
act,  is  a  tip-off  to  the  aggressive propaganda drive to box
President Clinton into taking action against Iran.

Several days before the  Pritchard  column appeared, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry, in an  interview  with  National  Public
Radio,  had  acknowledged  that there *could* be foreign agencies
behind the Dharhan  bombing,  including  Iran.   The American and
British media immediately  went  hog-wild,  practically  claiming
that  Perry  had  declared  war against Iran.  The White House on
Aug. 3  issued  a  clear  statement  repudiating  the media hype.
White House spokesman David Johnson told the New York Times:  "We
are cautioning that the investigation has not yet been concluded,
the culprit or culprits responsible have not yet been identified,
and...  speculation  about  what  type  of  response   might   be
appropriate  is  premature."   The next day, Perry told reporters
that any speculation about American  action against Iran "is just
not warranted at all."

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  jumped into the middle of the
hype on Aug. 3, demanding  that  President  Clinton  act  against
Iran.   Citing  reports  that  initially  appeared in the Israeli
press,  about  terrorist  training  camps  inside  Iran, Gingrich
threatened, "Either you close down those camps or  we  will.   If
the  Iranians  refuse  to  close  them  down, I think there are a
number of military means capable of closing them down."

The story about the  Iranian  terror  camps appeared in USA Today
Aug. 2, attributed to "leaked U.S. intelligence  documents";  and
syndicated columnists Evans and Novak on Aug. 1 surfaced a story,
about  Iranian  supplies  of  mortar-bombs  being  confiscated in
Antwerp, Belgium earlier  this  year.   The  same  column cited a
report from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak of a "terror summit"
in June in Teheran -- at which, allegedly,  some  of  the  recent
anti-American terrorist attacks were planned out.

In  every  instance  of  these  media  leaks, the linkage between
London and international  terrorism  has been omitted completely.
Yet, the Clinton administration, according to at least  one  news
account,  has  not  lost  sight of the London role in safehousing
some of the world's leading  terrorists.  According to the London
Observer, the U.S. has pressured the British government to  begin
an  investigation  into  several  London-based Islamic groups and
publications that have  been  agitating  for  a  Holy War against
American troops in Saudi Arabia.  Leaders of one such group,  the
Muslim  Literary  Circle,  were  recently interrogated by Special
Branch (British Intelligence),  and,  according to the Observer's
Nick Cohen, the British government opened the probe  under  heavy
pressure from the Clinton administration.

As  you  will  read  elsewhere  in  this  issue (see the American
Almanac), in an exclusive campaign memorandum by Lyndon LaRouche,
no competent investigation  of  international terrorism today can
ignore  the  top-down  control  exerted  by  the  London-centered
Anglo-Dutch/French "Entente  Cordiale."   While  it  would  be  a
mistake  to  rule  out any involvement by Iranian factions in the
present wave of global irregular  warfare, to focus upon Iran, or
Libya, or Iraq, while leaving out Britain and its leading Mideast
satrap, the Syria of Hafez al-Assad, would be folly --  precisely
the  kind of folly into which London would like to lure President
Clinton.
