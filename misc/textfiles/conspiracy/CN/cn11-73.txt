MONICA-GATE
===========
By Professor Peter Dale Scott
-----------------------------

[CN:  I received  the  following  from  Kenn  Thomas,  author  of
several  books  and  publisher of Steamshovel Press magazine.  (A
link to Steamshovel is at  the  Conspiracy  Nation  website  (see
below.))  Because  Professor  Scott ends by saying, "feel free to
forward this," I have taken  the  liberty of doing so.  Professor
Scott is the  author  of  several  books,  including  the  highly
recommended *Deep Politics*.]

__________
Monicagate

by Peter Dale Scott

In *Deep Politics and the Death of JFK* I write that study of any
one  of  our  deep  political crises will tell you more about the
rest.  Apparently this  prediction  holds  true for Monicagate as
well.

I am not talking about the recurrence of Washington lawyers  like
Robert  Bennett  and  Charles Ruff, who moved into the Washington
mainstream with Watergate,  and  now  represent Clinton.  Nothing
surprising or instructive about that.  (I haven't checked to  see
if  the  two  Robert  Bennetts  are in fact one and the same, but
think it likely.)

But did you notice  that  the  person who forwarded Linda Tripp's
tapes  of  Lewinsky  to  the   FBI   was   a   book   agent   and
pseudo-journalist called Lucianne Goldberg, who in 1972 "told the
McGovern  campaign  that  she   worked  for  the  North  American
Newspaper Alliance"?  [NANA] Goldberg's role was not simply  that
of  a  cut-out or messenger for Linda Tripp.  On Jan. 22 she told
the press "that she encouraged  her friend Linda Tripp... to tape
conversations with intern Monica Lewinsky."  (All quotations  are
from  an  article in the January 23 *San Francisco Chronicle,* p.
A11.)  She kept the tapes for Tripp and later turned them over to
the  FBI.   If  Tripp  instigated  Lewinsky, it would appear that
Goldberg instigated Tripp.

Both Tripp and Goldberg are apparently  Republicans.   Tripp  was
one  of  only  two holdovers from the Bush White House.  Goldberg
was exposed in 1973 as "a  spy  for Nixon while she traveled with
the press corps" covering McGovern's 1972 campaign.   It  was  at
this  time  that  she  said  she  worked for NANA (North American
Newspaper Alliance), and supplied  an  address for NANA which "is
the same as  her  current  residence"  in  Manhattan.   Watergate
investigators "said the Nixon campaign paid her $1,000 a week."

Not  mentioned  in today's story is the relevant fact in 1972, as
today, Lucianne Goldberg was snooping for sex.  She told the late
Anthony Lukas (*Nightmare*, p.  161)  that the Nixon people "were
looking for really dirty stuff...who was sleeping with whom, what
the Secret Service men were  doing with the stewardesses, who was
smoking pot on the plane -- that sort of thing."

Serious  students  of  the  JFK  Assassination  have  long   been
interested  in  NANA,  which  supplied  Priscilla Johnson (better
known now as  Priscilla  McMillan)  with  the  job  (or, to some,
cover) by which she voyaged to Moscow and there  interviewed  Lee
Harvey  Oswald  on  the  urging of U.S. Consul Snyder.  After the
assassination, Johnson developed a close relationship with Marina
Oswald, in connection with a book contract originally arranged by
C.D. Jackson of Life Magazine at the urging of Allen Dulles.

NANA was created by a  senior  veteran  of OSS, Ernest Cuneo, and
continued to have intelligence connections.  In 1963, before  the
assassination,  it  had  come  under  Congressional  scrutiny for
publishing Chinese Nationalist propaganda,  for which it had been
paid large sums without registering as a foreign agent.  At  this
same  time  its  President,  Ernest  Cuneo,  was  a member of the
Citizens' Committee for a Free Cuba,  a group calling in 1963 for
a more militant anti-Castro policy, and  meeting  with  dissident
Cuban exiles.

I am not here suggesting anything about the guilt or innocence of
Clinton,  only  that  at  least one of the people making his life
difficult has a background suggestive  of past intrigues.  I hope
that someone reading this can check Lucianne  Goldberg's  current
address,  and  see  if  in  fact (as she alleged) it was also the
address of NANA.

Feel free to forward this.
