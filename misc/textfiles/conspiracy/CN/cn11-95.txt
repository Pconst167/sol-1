FDR: TOOL OF HIDDEN POWER
=========================

Curtis B.  Dall  married  Anna  Roosevelt,  daughter  of Franklin
Delano Roosevelt (FDR).  Mr. Dall liked his father-in-law, and at
first was typically innocent of how the political  game  actually
works.  In his tell-all book, *FDR:  My Exploited Father-in-Law*,
Mr. Dall writes:

  In  1926,  political  matters  interested me but little.  I
  believed what the  important  candidates  for public office
  said, as reported in the press, and fully expected them  to
  carry  out their formal statements and promises made to the
  people in exchange for their support at the polls.

But Curtis Dall  later  found  out  that  things  weren't as they
seemed:

  A  political  production,  or  image  presentation,  via  a
  purported and well-advertised "platform,"  is  designed  to
  please  and  attract a larger "audience," not for cash, but
  for  votes.   If  successful,  the  political entrepreneurs
  [secret backers], by means of a few "suggested" legislative
  bills (loudly proclaimed to be in the public  interest,  of
  course)  find  ways  to  amply  reward themselves and their
  leading  actors.    Usually,   carefully  screened  leading
  "actors" are picked well in advance of election  day  by  a
  small   group,  picked  for  both  major  parties,  thereby
  reducing the promotional risk to just about zero.

  IT IS DESIREABLE FOR [THE CANDIDATE] TO HAVE GREAT PERSONAL
  AMBITION AND, PERCHANCE, TO  BE VULNERABLE TO BLACKMAIL FOR
  SOME PAST OCCURRENCES; HENCE, SOMEONE NOT APT TO BECOME TOO
  INDEPENDENT IN TIME, BUT ALWAYS AMENABLE  TO  "SUGGESTIONS"
  ON THE POLICY LEVEL. [emphasis added]

Shearing of the Sheep: 1929
---------------------------

Says  Woodrow  Wilson:   "But  I  don't want those weapons; there
isn't an enemy to fight."

Says Morgan, Schwab & Company  (in a populist cartoon ca.  1917):
"You buy these guns and we'll get you an enemy."

World War I, the "War to End All Wars," concluded and  the  first
attempt  at  a  New  World  Order got underway.  But the American
public wanted no  part  of  the  League  of  Nations.  Times were
relatively good in the 1920s (except for  farmers.)   The  nation
went  on  a stock market frenzy, but they were being set up.  The
stock market crashed in  1929;  it was "the calculated 'shearing'
of the public by the World-Money powers, triggered by the planned
sudden shortage of the supply of call money in the New York money
market," writes Dall.  Witnessing the carnage from the  Visitor's
Gallery  of  the  Stock Exchange was Sir Winston Churchill, there
perhaps by "coincidence."   But  was  Churchill's presence just a
happenstance?  Not so, according to Mr. Pat Riott, author of *The
Greatest Story Never Told:  Winston Churchill and  the  Crash  of
1929*.

According to Mr. Riott, financier Bernard Baruch and others began
buying  gold  in  the summer of 1929, while at the same time they
and their  clique  planted  stories  in  financial-type magazines
extolling   stock    market    get-rich-quick   prognostications.
Background plotters were the Federal Reserve, Winston  Churchill,
Montague  Norman  of  the  Bank  of  England,  and  U.S. Treasury
Secretary Andrew Mellon.  This  was  a joint British/U.S. scheme,
with mis-named, private banks  "Bank  of  England"  and  "Federal
Reserve"  calling  the  shots.   Churchill's  connection?  He was
Minister of the Exchequer, akin  to the Secretary of the Treasury
in the U.S. In 1925, Churchill had overseen the flow of  hundreds
of  millions  in  gold  to the U.S.; this gold was the foundation
used to prop up the  Wall  Street  bubble of the late 1920s.  But
once the suckers had been lured into the market, the conspirators
secretly bought up the gold at low prices.  Finally, the  Federal
Reserve  greatly  curtailed  the  money supply, and boom went the
Wall Street casino.

Also  in  on   the   scheme   was   Joseph   Kennedy,  father  of
future-President John F. Kennedy.  The international money  power
and  its  major  players  dared not be seen close to the disaster
(except for Churchill,  literally  at  the  crime  scene while it
happened), so they used various  front  men  to  implement  their
plans.   They  "would  not  dare  pick  a Rothschild, a Sasoon, a
Warburg, a Sieff, a Morgan...  to wield 'the clippers,'" so, says
Dall, they whistled up frontmen such as Joe  Kennedy  to  do  the
dirty  work.  Kennedy Sr. and a few others were among the largest
short-sellers of stock  just  prior  to  the  collapse of October
1929. 

FDR and the Gold Robbers
------------------------

The next scheme to rob  the  American working public was launched
through FDR.  (You can see how these schemes keep  coming  along;
e.g.   S&Ls are robbed in the 1980s then bailed out by taxpayers,
and now taxpayers are  about  to  be  robbed  again by paying for
bailouts of banks, over-extended in Asia.)  FDR decreed that  the
American  people  had  to turn in their gold, in return for funny
money from the  Federal  Reserve.   Gold  could  not  be owned by
Americans, but Europeans were free to purchase all the gold  they
wanted  from the USA, through European banks -- at bargain prices
of $20 - $35 per ounce!   Gold  poured  out of Fort Knox and into
Europe, and now Fort  Knox  is  empty.   A  false  impression  is
maintained  by  keeping  guards  around  Fort Knox, as if there's
anything in there to  guard!   (Just  like Napoleon who, invading
the Netherlands, discovered that the  Bank  of  Holland  held  no
gold.)

FDR & Howard Hughes: Both Held Captive
--------------------------------------

Like   Howard  Hughes,  held  captive  and  controlled  by  those
surrounding him, so too FDR became increasingly a prisoner in his
own White House.  "Apparently, his  advisors had moved in...  FDR
had become a sort of political 'captive,'" writes Dall.  The main
puppeteers surrounding Roosevelt were Felix Frankfurter,  Bernard
Baruch  (he  of  the  previously  mentioned  stock market robbery
scheme), and Eleanor Roosevelt, FDR's  wife.   So too now is Bill
Clinton boxed in, but not through physical infirmity but  through
blackmailability.   ("It  is  desireable  for the candidate to be
vulnerable to blackmail," writes Dall.)

The controlled FDR  presided  over  a  major  mess.  According to
Dall,  here  is  some  of  what  was  going   on   during   FDR's
administration:

  **  NAACP  (National  Association  for  the  Advancement of
  Colored   People)   was    financed    and    managed    by
  "internationalists who seemed quite willing to exploit race
  friction, even to the point of civil disorder."  The secret
  government  continues  to  "divide  and  conquer" up to the
  present day, for example by fomenting  the  L.A.  riots  of
  1992, as described in a previous issue  of  the  Conspiracy
  Nation Newsletter (hardcopy  edition).  Another "divide and
  conquer" technique used has been hysteria over the  burning
  of black churches.  That  whole  non-event was a propaganda
  exercise, since most of the burned-down churches  had  been
  destroyed for insurance motivations, and the actual  number
  of black churches burning had gone down.  Also being worked
  out is the arming of  black  street gangs to serve as shock
  troops when/if the  U.S.  government  decides it's time for
  more repression  here  in  America.   Don't  think it could
  happen?   Then  recall Oliver North's secret plan to set up
  detention camps for U.S. citizens.

  ** Dall makes plain that FDR and/or those close to him were
  aware of the  imminent  attack  on  Pearl  Harbor  and  did
  nothing to prevent or warn about it.  Other authors say the
  same,  for  example  John  Toland,  in  his  book *Infamy*.
  Toland  says  that  Naval  Intelligence  was  warned of the
  imminent attack on the Hawaiian base, yet Washington DC did
  nothing.  This situation is  true-to-form  for  the  secret
  government:  e.g.  The Gulf of Tonkin incident, drawing  us
  deep into the Vietnam War -- but Gulf of Tonkin was a phony
  story; (see *Endless Enemies* by Jonathan Kwitny); e.g. the
  invasion  of  Kuwait  by  Iraq -- but U.S. Ambassador April
  Glaspie had just given Saddam Hussein a  "green  light"  to
  invade Kuwait; (see *Fooling America* by Robert Parry.)

Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy Against FDR
--------------------------------------

Amazingly,  Hillary  Clinton  has said there's a "vast right-wing
conspiracy" against husband Bill.   It's  amazing Hillary says so
because, after all, here in the USA Magic Kingdom everyone  knows
that,  contrary  to  conspiracies  having always existed in every
other time and  place,  our  own  little  sandbox uniquely has no
conspiracies going on.  But FDR faced his  own  "vast  right-wing
conspiracy" in his own day.  Recruited into the "American Liberty
League"  in  1934 was General Smedley Butler.  Butler was to head
the League, whose backers included the Mellons, the Rockefellers,
and the DuPonts.   A  plot  was  hatched  to  "create  an army of
500,000 veterans to take control of  the  government."   (Source:
*Treason*  by  Gurudas.)  But Butler remained loyal, secretly, to
the U.S. Constitution and betrayed the plotters.  The almost coup
d'etat never happened and FDR's presidency was  "saved"  --  (but
"saved" for whom?)

In the case of "Hillary Clinton:  Conspiracy Buff," there is some
truth in what she says.   Again,  as  in 1934, we have the Mellon
family  connected  to  subversion  against  the  U.S.  President.
Richard Mellon-Scaife subsidizes a newspaper,  until  recently  a
magazine,  and  has  set  up a nice comfy job for Ken Starr.  But
although Mr. Mellon-Scaife  does  help distribute the information
sullying Bill Clinton, he is not inventing the information out of
thin air.  ("It is desireable for the candidate to be subject  to
blackmail.") The interesting thing is that Mellon-Scaife seems to
be  a rogue operation, not sanctioned by all members of the Power
Elite.  If the Powerful were to  all agree that Bill Clinton must
go, wind-up robots like Dan Rather would  begin  foaming  at  the
mouth, screaming about "Evil Bill Clinton."

Conclusion
----------

Mr.  Dall  summarizes  his  expose  on  FDR  by warning that "the
creators  of  false  images  are  operating  today...  full time,
festooned about  the  White  House  and  on  Capitol  Hill,  busy
creating  'managed  news'  for  you and me, even withholding some
news."
