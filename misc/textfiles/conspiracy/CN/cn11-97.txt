SEXUAL AND JUDICIAL INTRIGUE
============================
By Sherman H. Skolnick

(Contact: 773-375-5741; Recorded message: 773-731-1100)

[Editor's Note:  I have no  personal knowledge as to the accuracy
of  some  of  Mr.  Skolnick's claims.  However, in a conversation
with a professional  journalist  recently,  he  confirmed that he
also had been  hearing  rumors  of  a  past  sexual  relationship
between Bill Clinton and Judge Susan Webber Wright.]

Susan reportedly was not that good of a law student, and her  law
professor, William Jefferson Clinton, knew it.  Clinton's alleged
"girl  friend," Hillary Rodham, later to be his so-called "wife,"
stepped in  to  resolve  matters.   To  obscure events, Professor
Clinton supposedly  "lost"  his  student  Susan's  class  papers.
Hillary  apparently  persuaded  Bill  to  give  student  Susan an
apparently undeserved high mark, necessary to her future career.

Both Bill and Hillary each separately understood the realities of
politics.  From  an  early  age,  each  had  separate  duties and
agendas with the American CIA.   In  later  years  they  were  to
marry,  as  required  of what the spy craft calls a "CIA couple."
Hillary realized Bill was the ticket into the seat of power.

Good student or not, Susan also knew how to get herself a ticket.

How all this works reads  like  the sweaty details from a grocery
magazine.  Susan was apparently "A.C.-D.C." and hit it  off  well
with  Hillary,  who  was  part  of  a  corrupt  circle of lesbian
business  women  from   the   Chicago   suburb   of  Park  Ridge.
Thereafter, Susan also reportedly serviced Bill.

Not too well understood:  A campaign for President is planned  at
least  four years in advance.  George Herbert Walker Bush, former
Director of  Central  Intelligence  (DCIA),  became  President in
1988.  {1} His long-time protege, Bill Clinton {2}, was slated by
the  secret  society,  the  Bilderbergers,  as next-in-line to be
President.  A rather obscure  southern governor, Bill was invited
by the Bilderbergers to their clandestine  meeting  in  1991,  in
Baden-Baden, Germany.

1991  was  a  turning-point year.  Fifty-eight million dollars of
federal  funds  had  been  parked  with  Chicago-based  Household
International and Household Bank,  to  make  good a pending fraud
claim.  Of this, $50 million was secretly transferred  to  Little
Rock,  as  sources  claim,  by  the  suspected  CIA  proprietary,
Peregrine   Financial   Group,   Inc.,  a  purported  adjunct  of
Household.  All  this  was  to  conceal  an  embezzlement  of $47
million from Madison Guaranty Savings &  Loan,  for  which,  when
revealed, Bill and Hillary Clinton would be subject to being sent
to federal prison.

This  cover  up  was  mandated so that Bill Clinton could run for
President.

Fifty million dollars had been transferred  so as to cover up the
$47 million embezzlement.  The left-over $3 million was  used  to
jump-start  Bill  Clinton's  campaign  for  high  office,  around
November  of  1991.   Arranging  to latch onto the money was Rahm
Emanuel,  a  purported  Israeli   intelligence  agent  with  dual
U.S./Israeli citizenship.  During  the  Persian  Gulf  War,  Rahm
Emanuel  had  left the U.S. to serve in the Israeli army.  Later,
Mr. Emanuel became a Clinton  White House senior advisor, reputed
"bagman," and, some vigorously assert, assassin arranger.

1991 was a key year as well for Clinton's former  student,  Susan
Webber.  She knew how to blackmail presidential aspirant Clinton,
so  as  to  get  Clinton's  crony,  George  Bush, to appoint her,
qualified or not, as a  new  U.S.  District Judge in Little Rock.
She threatened to otherwise  wreck  Bill  Clinton's  presidential
campaign   with  steamy  disclosures  about  how  she  reportedly
sexually serviced the would-be president.

The appointment of a new Federal District Judge requires the okay
and blessings of the  politicos  in  the state.  Governor Clinton
was instrumentally involved in the CIA dope traffic from Arkansas
and other southern states with his confederates, George Bush  and
Oliver  North.   From time to time, Clinton even stayed at George
Bush's plush vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine. {3}

Clinton helped install to power Judge Susan Webber.

Was it just a coincidence then, that the  case  of  Paula  Corbin
Jones  vs.   William  Jefferson  Clinton was put on the docket of
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber?

Were the attorneys for Paula  Jones  in  a position to know about
the judge's dalliance with Clinton?  As Officers  of  the  Court,
however,  lawyers  are  not  in a position to be whistle-blowers.
The judge had earlier dismissed  the  case, but that decision was
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, which deemed it a proper case
and sent it back to her for a prompt trial.

Also known is that Judge Susan Webber's husband, Wright, was made
a federal official  by  President  Clinton,  who  was  reportedly
blackmailed by Judge Susan Webber Wright.  Her husband ostensibly
manipulates and arranges her decisions -- so that some rightfully
claim  the  rulings are not hers, as a judge, but rather those of
her husband.  Court observers who  are  not so polite simply call
her husband a "bagman," and "judicial pimp."

In December, 1997, my TV show on public access cable touched  off
a commotion.  We exclusively detailed the confession of a 25-year
career  court  "bagman":   James  R. Vassilos.  Vassilos has been
long-protected  by  corrupt  officials   and  state  and  federal
authorities.  Just prior to the broadcast, two top IRS officials,
in a three-and-a-half hour meeting  with  me  and  my  associate,
Joseph  Andreuccetti,  declared  that  we would be arrested if we
went on the air with Vassilos' confession.

Among other  things,  Vassilos  has  been  a  courier of judicial
bribery money -- Chicago to Little  Rock.   Did  Susan's  husband
know  Vassilos?  With Vassilos a confessed bagman and the other a
reputed bagman and procurer of judicial rulings, who knows? 

So nobody should  be  surprised  that  U.S.  District Judge Susan
Webber Wright {4} again "serviced"  defendant  Clinton  with  the
second dismissal of the case of Paula Corbin Jones.

Under  the  circumstances,  Judge Wright's decisions appear to be
the seldom-mentioned  item  of  jurisprudence,  A  FRAUD UPON THE
COURT, BY THE JUDGE HERSELF.  But  who  in  the  legal  community
dares to talk about it?  (Since going with an earlier version  of
this  story,  Judge  Wright  has  caused  threats  to be directed
against me and broadcasters who dare to allow me on the air.)

---------------------------<< Notes >>---------------------------
{1} George Bush officially became President in  1988,  but  some,
including  Col.  (Ret.)   Bo  Gritz, say that Bush became the *de
facto* U.S. President  in  1981,  when  Ronald  Reagan was almost
killed in a strange assassination attempt.
{2} For  more  on  the  Bush-Clinton  connection,  see  the  book
*Compromised* by Terry Reed and John Cummings.
{3}  Clinton,  while Arkansas governor, met privately with George
Bush at Kennebunkport at  least  once,  as documented in the book
*Boy Clinton* by R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.
{4} In the previous  issue  of Conspiracy Nation, the possibility
of  a  symbolic  "message"  contained  in  the  JONESboro  school
massacre, meant to warn those handling the Paula Jones case,  was
discussed.   Thanks  to  an alert reader for pointing out another
connection between the  JONESboro  shootings  and the JONES case:
Name of teacher killed at JONESboro -- Shannon  WRIGHT;  Name  of
judge in the Paula Jones case -- Susan Webber WRIGHT.
