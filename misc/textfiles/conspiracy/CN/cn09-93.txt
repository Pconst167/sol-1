                     A CIA FUNDING OPERATION
                      by Gene "Chip" Tatum
                             12/28/96
 
STEP 1:
Find a depository which fits the following criteria:
     1.  Large cash reserves.
     2.  Much of the cash reserves should represent deposits from
         an  illegal activity (ie:  drug transactions).  For this
         example we will use Banco  Nacional de Panama, a reserve
         depository which is protected by  Manuel  Noriega.   The
         depositor  will  be  Pablo  Escobar.  Finding the proper
         depository would be the function of the CIA, and in this
         example we will use William Casey.
 
STEP 2:
Arrange for a loan from this depository.  We will use the name of
George Bush in this  example  for  the person obtaining the loan.
We will use the amount of $8 billion for this example.  Sometimes
the depository will not be very cooperative.  If this occurs, the
CIA will coerce  or  intimidate  the  depository  officials  into
cooperating.  Ultimately, the loan will be made.
 
STEP 3:
Split the loan proceeds in  half.   One half ($4 billion) will be
sent to Iran to purchase "super bills" at the rate of two  "super
bills"  for one authentic bill.  Thus, $4 billion in cash buys $8
billion in "super bills."  (NOTE:   A "super bill" is a perfectly
counterfeited U.S. bill.  These bills are printed by an  Intaglio
press  which was sold to the Shah of Iran in the late '60s, early
'70s.   The  Shah  was  also  given  the  plates,  ink  and paper
necessary  to  successfully   print   U.S.   dollars   in   large
denominations.    This   was  given  to  the  Shah  by  the  CIA.
Unfortunately, the Shah left the press, plates, ink and paper for
the Iranian Revolutionary Councils  when  he  fled in late 1978.)
The second half of the loan ($4 billion) will be sent  to  a  CIA
launderer  selected  by the CIA (Casey) for his or her ability to
move largesums of money around the  world as a matter of ordinary
business.  For this example we will use the name of Nana DeBusia.
(DeBusia is the grandson of Guyana's first democratic leader  and
owner of many U.S. and foreign banks.)
 
STEP 4:
Repay  original loan to depository in "super bills."  (Give Banco
Nacional de Panama $8  billion  in  "super  bills" to replace the
authentic currency it loaned.)  These "super bills" are placed in
the reserve vault and, as long as they are not withdrawn  by  the
depositor,  their  existence will not jeopardize the value of the
U.S. dollar.  But, because they are  perfect in every way, to put
the "super bills" in circulation  would  eventually  devalue  the
U.S.  dollar  by  flooding  the  monetary  marketplace  with U.S.
currency.
 
STEP 5:
Arrange  to  sell  Iran  something  of  value  for  the authentic
currency used to purchase the "super bills."  In this example, we
will use arms, ammunition  and  replacement  parts  for  military
equipment.   (We will use the name Oliver North as the example of
a person arranging the sale  of  arms  to Iran.)  In other words,
the CIA now arranges to sell Iran $4 billion worth  of  arms  and
equipment  in  order  to get the original $4 billion of authentic
currency back.  Now, the  CIA  has  $4  billion to use in funding
covert activities without relying on Congressional authority  and
funding.   If  caught,  the CIA can report the source of funds as
being from an arms transaction with Iran.
 
STEP 6:
Ensure that the "super  bills"  are  not withdrawn.  This is done
through  the  process  of  neutralization   of   the   depositor.
Neutralization   is   the   use   of  intimidation,  coercion  or
termination.  In this example, Pablo Escobar is killed.
 
STEP 7:
This CIA launderer in possession of one-half of the original loan
proceeds is moving his $4  billion  through a maze of banks which
are cooperative with both the launderer and the  CIA.   For  this
example, we will use the following trail of deposits to banks:  a
bank  in  Spain; the Vatican Bank; banks in Luxembourg.  Then the
launderer wires from his London offices $3.8 billion in laundered
monies to  private  numbered  accounts  being  controlled  by the
original architects.  The launderer keeps $200  million  for  his
job well done, leaving the $3.8 billion in the numbered accounts.
 
STEP 8:
Neutralize  the  CIA launderer.  In this example Nana DeBusia was
indicted by the U.S. on 32 counts to include bank fraud.  The CIA
stepped up in his behalf and  stated  that it would not be in the
best interest of the U.S. to prosecute DeBusia.   He  was  facing
several   hundred   years   in   prison  if  convicted.   He  was
subsequently acquitted on all counts.
 
 
                            CIA TALLY
 
$4 billion for use in unauthorized black ops*
    (*black operations  are  those  covert  operations  performed
    without the knowledge or authority of Congress.)
$3.8  billion  in  private  numbered  accounts  controlled by the
architects of the funding operation
 
 
                        SUMMARY OF THE EXAMPLE
 
To summarize the example, the Director of the CIA, William Casey,
approached the Ex-Director of the  CIA and current Vice President
of the United States, George Bush, with the name of a  vulnerable
depository,  the  Banco  Nacional de Panama.  Vice President Bush
then arranged for a short term loan of $8 billion.  Bush arranged
for $4 billion to  go  to  Iran  to  purchase  super bills and $4
billion to go to  Nana  DeBusia  to  be  laundered  into  several
private accounts.  He (Bush) commissioned Oliver North to oversee
the  Iranian  connection.   North  delivered  $4  billion in U.S.
currency to Iran.  Iran gave  North  $8 billion in super bills in
exchange for the $4 billion in good U.S.  currency.   North  then
delivered  the  $8  billion  in  super  bills  back  to the Banco
Nacional de Panama.  The loan transaction is now complete.
 
There is $8 billion in super  bills  in the reserve vaults of the
Banco Nacional de Panama, there is $4 billion in  authentic  U.S.
currency in the hands of the Iranians, and there is $4 billion in
good  currency  with CIA launderer Nana DeBusia.  North sells the
Iranians military hardware and parts for the amount of $4 billion
and diverts a portion of the proceeds to the Contras of Nicaragua
(Iran/Contra).  Nana DeBusia, in  the meantime, is laundering the
deposits of $4  billion  through  various  banks,  including  the
Vatican's  bank  in  Italy.   After  several  successful  banking
transactions, DeBusia presents $3.8 billion in the sound deposits
to  numbered  accounts  in  various  locations.  When the funding
operation is complete, there is $4  billion in CIA accounts to be
utilized for covert and black operations; there is  $3.8  billion
in  private  numbered  accounts  controlled  by  George  Bush and
William Casey.  Pablo Escobar,  the  primary depositor is dead to
ensure no one will withdraw the super bills.  General Noriega  is
in  U.S.  federal  prison and under constant U.S. guard to ensure
his silence, and William Casey  is  dead, leaving $3.8 billion in
good U.S. currency in the control of George Bush.
