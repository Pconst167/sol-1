DR. FONG'S "DOCUMENTS," AL GORE, AND JOSEPH ANDREUCCETTI
========================================================
 Chinese Communists Conduct Witch Hunt Against Al Gore?
--------------------------------------------------------

In CN 10.29 ("Use  At  Own  Risk!")  was described one Francis K.
Fong, said to be a "defrocked professor  originally  with  Purdue
University."   Because  the  information in CN 10.29 was received
anonymously,  I  am  somewhat   uncertain  how  accurate  it  is.
Nonetheless, my contacts confirm that Dr.  Fong  may  well  be  a
deeper  character  than  he seems; he may even be dangerous, i.e.
"not someone to mess with."

In CN 10.29  was  also  described  one  James  R. Vassilos.  This
person was contacting me  for  awhile  via  U.S.  mail,  urgently
wanting  to  set  up  a meeting near the central Illinois/Indiana
border.  Because  such  blind  meetings  (I  am  advised)  can be
dangerous, I asked Vassilos to phone me so we  could  discuss  it
further.  (You can tell a lot about a person just by talking over
the  phone.)   But,  said  Vassilos,  he doesn't have a phone.  I
responded that Vassilos could call  me  collect.  "No can do," he
replied.  "You have the most tapped phone in  Champaign  County."
So  Vassilos  (therefore)  *must* meet me near the Indiana border
(with "hot"  information)  but,  since  there  is  (supposedly) a
wiretap on my phone, he can't speak with  me  beforehand  --  not
even  to  engage  in  idle  chit-chat.   At  this  point  I  grew
suspicious,  and  my  suspicions  were  confirmed  by  some of my
contacts.  A  meeting  near  the  central Illinois/Indiana border
would just so happen to be near the turf of Dr. Fong,  previously
mentioned.   Was  a  trap  being  laid?  I was advised by contact
"Deep Blue" (not Skolnick)  that  if  I  decided  to go to such a
meeting I was to bring him along.

CN 10.29 links  Dr.  Fong  to  the  Red  Chinese  secret  police.
Allegedly,  Fong has a laboratory "in his basement where he is an
expert at creating fake  documents."   Vassilos and Fong are said
to be part of a team out to destroy Al Gore.  Vassilos is  linked
to   the  frame-up  of  Charles  Hayes,  as  is  Lawrence  Myers,
"journalist *extraordinaire*."  (See  CN 10.07.)  Since President
Bill Clinton is such a good friend to Red China  (with  "campaign
contributions"  funneled  to  him  part  of a Red Chinese plot to
exert control over American  politics),  it stands to reason that
any enemy of Bill Clinton is an enemy of Red China.

Enter  Al  Gore.   According  to  Sarah  McClendon,   a   veteran
journalist  with  decades of experience covering the White House,
"a rift is escalating between President and Mrs. Clinton and Vice
President  Albert   Gore."    Sherman   Skolnick,  the  legendary
Chicago-based  muckraker,  has consistently reported that Al Gore
and a faction  of  the  U.S.  military  have  been trying to oust
Clinton.  Despite the facade presented via  television  of  "Bill
Clinton and his pal Al," appearances are obviously deceiving.  Al
Gore  and Bill Clinton are at odds, and any enemy of Bill Clinton
is, *ipso facto*, an enemy of Red China.

We have Dr. Fong, allegedly  a  high-ranking operative of the Red
Chinese  secret  police  who,  it  is  said,  is  an  expert   at
manufacturing  fake documents.  We have a report from Non-Network
News that Red-Hillary Clinton  "flew  into  a rage" and "demanded
that FBI Director Louis Freeh release to the Chicago Tribune  the
FBI  file  on  the  late  Mayor  Daley."   Such information *was*
released to the  Chicago  Tribune  which,  on  August 31st, 1997,
carried a front-page story implying that the late  Mayor  Richard
J.  Daley  of  Chicago  was  a  Communist.   We have reports from
Sherman Skolnick (e.g.  CN  10.82)  in  early August regarding an
"extended meeting" between current Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley
(son of Richard J. Daley) and Al Gore.  Said to have  been  under
discussion at that meeting was a plot to oust Bill Clinton.

So  we  have Al Gore at odds with Bill Clinton, and Mayor Richard
M. Daley teamed with Al Gore.  We have reports of an operative of
the Red Chinese secret police  who makes fake documents.  We have
Hillary having a fit and demanding that "documents"  be  released
to  the  Chicago Tribune.  Said "documents" seem to have played a
role in smearing the name  of  the  late Richard J. Daley, and by
inference, the name of his son, Mayor Richard M.  Daley,  in  the
Chicago Tribune front-page story.

Also  tied  in  with  all  this  is  an  illegal  raid reportedly
conducted on the home of  Joseph Andreuccetti on August 28, 1997.
(See CN 10.99.)  In  Andreuccetti's  safekeeping  were  sensitive
documents  he  had received temporarily from Sherman Skolnick.  I
spoke by  phone  with  Andreuccetti  who  confirms  that the raid
occurred  as  stated  in  a  lawsuit  filed   by   Skolnick   and
Andreuccetti  on  September  4, 1997.  (Document can be viewed at
http://feustel.mixi.net) Skolnick and Andreuccetti, under penalty
of perjury, affirm that "seized, grabbed, and carried away" were

  sources, as  to  an  upcoming  planned  campaign  by  major
  newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, to falsely label
  and   describe  Vice  President  Albert  Gore,  Jr.,  as  a
  "communist" and "communist sympathizer," based on false and
  fraudulent  purported  FBI  and  other  records,  so  as to
  purport to justify the removal of Gore as  Vice  President,
  as a national security risk.

  newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, to falsely label
  and  describe Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., as having been a
  "communist" and "communist sympathizer"  based on false and
  fraudulent FBI and other records, so that if data comes out
  in court and elsewhere that Dr. King was assassinated by  a
  high-level  government  plot,  that his death, in any case,
  would be proper and justified,  based  on his having been a
  "communist" and "communist  sympathizer,"  and  a  national
  security risk.

  fraudulent FBI and other records, so that if data comes out
  in   court   and  elsewhere,  that  President  Kennedy  was
  assassinated by way  of  a  high-government  plot, that his
  death, in any case, would be proper and justified, based on
  his having been a national security risk as  a  "communist"
  and "communist sympathizer."
