   On December 1, 1991, Tommy Burkett was found dead in his Herndon,
   Virginia home with multiple injuries--a fractured jaw, a battered
   right ear, and abrasions on his chest. He also had a bullet wound to
   the head, supposedly self-inflicted from a .357 Magnum that was in the
   room. The exit wound was 1/4" by 1/2". The autopsy revealed no powder
   burns nor powder debris. The gun's cylinder was unlatched, and there
   were no prints on the gun or cartridges. The police did not talk to
   witnesses who observed Tommy's car being chased that afternoon , saw
   his car returned to the house hours after he was already dead, and
   observed other cars at the scene.
   
   The investigating officer from the Fairfax County Police lied
   repeatedly concerning his activities; the medical examiner's signature
   was forged on the report identifying manner and cause of death one day
   prior to an autopsy; and the pathologist denied the existence of
   photos of the injured right ear even though he had previously shown
   them to Tommy's father. After appealing to the Virginia State Medical
   Examiner and The Governor, the parents appealed to the Justice
   Department.
   
   The FBI at first refused to investigate, but after Janet Reno received
   over 4000 signatures on a petition, they opened an investigation. In
   their 20-month "investigation" they never spoke to the investigating
   officer and accepted the word of the local medical examiner, Dr.
   Donald Haut that his obviously forged signature was his own(Wm.
   Megary, the FBI supervisor, said "Anyone can sign anyone's name to
   anything."). They took walls from the Burkett house which held blood
   spatter far removed from the death scene but did no DNA testing,
   although they did acknowledge it was human blood and the pattern was
   consistent with gunshot injuries. FBI investigator Robert Pocica
   refused to accept tips from "Unsolved Mysteries" and refused to
   interview reporters who had received threats after covering Tommy's
   story. He did not obtain or test the gun, nor did he obtain and
   compare fingerprints collected by the expert hired by the family (the
   FCPD did no fingerprinting other than the gun, did not test the gun,
   did not remove the supposed "fatal" bullet from the wall nor do any
   other forensic tests). In short, the FBI followed the same script as
   the FCPD with the obvious intention of clearing the local cops of any
   wrongdoing. This is the pattern established by the feds in cases like
   this. (See the "Primetime" segment of Dec. 13, 1995 on FBI
   investigations of local police misconduct.)
