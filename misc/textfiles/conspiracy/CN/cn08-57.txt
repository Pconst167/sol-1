TWA FLIGHT 800
==============
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
800 is the beginning of a toll-free call.  But TWA Flight 800 was
not toll-free.  The toll:   229  killed.  Background is necessary
to understand what happened.
 
The American CIA fomented and financed the Afghanistan War, as  a
way  of  giving  the  Soviet-dominated  regime there a taste of a
civil war, Viet Nam-style,  inconclusive  in the field, unpopular
back  home.   The  local  insurgents,  more  at  home  with  dope
smuggling, were supplied by CIA with  hundreds  and  hundreds  of
portable  ground-to-air  missiles.   Most  were shoulder-mounted,
bazooka-style -- at the  business  end, heat-seeking.  Capable of
going up several thousand feet, right up the hot  exhaust-end  of
an  airplane  engine, and blowing it apart, and igniting the fuel
tanks.
 
By the way, CBS News' anchor face, Dan Rather, reportedly was the
go-between  in  some  instances  between the American CIA and the
insurgents.
 
After the War, the CIA-trained terrorists, still having  hundreds
of   such   missiles   and  knowing  how  to  use  them  --  like
Frankenstein's Monster, turned against  their maker.  While under
total, around-the-clock surveillance by the FBI and the CIA, they
planned and carried out the bombing of the World Trade Center  in
New York.
 
Maybe  the  American  secret  police  thought  they  could make a
dramatic arrest  of  their  own  terrorists  at  the last minute.
Maybe what happened (like the Oklahoma bombings) was  the  result
of  massive bungling by the FBI and the CIA.  The facts about the
World Trade Center bombing have been suppressed.
 
Incidentally, the former head of the Afghani CIA has been working
as security for a university in Chicago.
 
The Flight 800 disaster came  shortly  after a meeting in Toronto
of the secret society, the  Bilderberg  Group.   After  all,  the
ultra-rich  and their puppets, covered up by the presslords, have
caused wars and  depressions,  and  carried out political murders
like that of JFK -- great bloodshed does not make  them  hesitate
from   their   secret  agenda  of  total  rule,  sometimes  using
orchestrated violence and disasters to divert attention.
 
(The Flight 800 event occurred shortly  after the one about to be
named head of his family empire, Amschel Rothschild, was murdered
in Paris.  Part of a traditional war between the Rockefellers and
the Rothschilds.  In 1978, we did an exclusive  story  about  the
murder   of  banking  family  chief,  John  D.  Rockefeller  III.
Traditionally, the Rockefellers  dominated  the major airlines in
the U.S. such as United Air Lines.)
 
In 1983, 250 were slaughtered when the U.S. Marine  barracks  was
blown  up in Lebanon by CIA-dominated terrorists who went against
their bosses,  using  exclusive,  CIA-supplied  super explosives.
The terrorists violated CIA instructions to use the CIA-developed
explosives only against targets selected and approved by CIA.
 
At the time, were all the  true  facts  known,  President  Ronald
Reagan  and  Vice  President  George  Bush, formerly head of CIA,
should have been tried for treason against the American people.
 
Then and now, the White House  and  the press whores have lied to
us.
 
A few days after the TWA  disaster,  the  federal  secret  police
briefed a closed session of a U.S. Senate Committee.  Terrorists,
long  dominated by CIA, had been spotted and surveilled along the
oceanfront near JFK Airport,  the Senators were told.  Undercover
human intelligence  as  well  as  photos  and  electronic  means,
according  to  the  Senate  briefing,  showed the terrorists were
equipped with updated portable missiles,  supplied to them by the
CIA to be used against sworn  enemies  of  the  U.S.  The  latest
version of the portable missiles could down a plane as high as 30
thousand feet.
 
Based  on  the  on-going  intelligence,  and  fearing an imminent
missile attack against a  U.S.  airplane,  the  FBI and CIA, in a
rare instance of co-operation,  arranged  for a military plane to
drop white phosphorus flares nearby to  what  seemed  to  be  the
terrorist  target,  TWA Flight 800.  In a speed boat, the missile
launchers were, by portable radio, listening to the airport tower
take-off instructions, according to the Senate briefing session.
 
Called "Willie Peters," the flares are used for two purposes:  to
illuminate a battlefield, or to side-track a heat-seeking missile
that had locked onto an airplane.
 
With the flares, the FBI, the  CIA, and the military thought they
could neutralize the missile attack and become heroes by carrying
out a  dramatic  arrest  of  the  religious  fanatics  originally
trained for terror missions by CIA, the Senators were told.
 
For  business  reasons,  the airline industry greatly opposes any
talk of airplane sabotage.   For  example, in 1973, attorneys for
United Air Lines (then dominated by the Rockefellers) caused  the
suppression   of   my  book,  "The  Secret  History  of  Airplane
Sabotage." 
 
If forced to mention foul play, the air lines would rather say it
was a  bomb.   They  could  cool  off  the  public  by announcing
supposedly increased security checking of packages  and  baggage.
It  is  almost  impossible  to stop someone from using a portable
missile, from a car or  van,  or  from  a  boat, at the end of an
airport runway, against a plane just landing or taking off.   The
air   lines  feared  missile  publicity  at  the  height  of  the
vacation-travelling season.
 
In large cities like Chicago, more  than half of the FBI baby-sit
local Arab-Americans, with the FBI  looking  through  their  back
windows all night.  Or FBI sitting all day watching an Arab-owned
grocery  store.  It is wrong to suppose all Arabs are terrorists.
Tell the FBI about it.
 
The federal fakers  fear  telling  the  truth about CIA-dominated
Islamic extremists would  set  off  a  hard-to-stop  epidemic  of
attacks on Arab-Americans in general.
