U.K., French, Journalists Confide:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                "PRINCESS DIANA WAS ASSASSINATED."
                ==================================

This is Sherman Skolnick.

In   the   last   few   days  I  have  interviewed,  extensively,
well-informed United Kingdom (UK), French, and other journalists.
(And I promised never to use their names because of the nature of
what was discussed.)  They told me that many of the distinguished
journalists in  the  United  Kingdom  are  aware,  from their own
reliable sources in key places in the government  and  elsewhere,
that British Intelligence had assassinated Princess Diana.

They  went  over  details,  of  the  specifics  of  how  they, as
journalists, from their  sources  (separate  from me), know about
the technical information on how the  assassination  was  carried
out.

But  first  of  all, we have to discuss why the real story is not
being told, in print, or on  the  radio, or on television, in the
UK. 

Not many know that in the UK they have the Official Secrets  Act.
By  that Act, the London government has the power, throughout the
UK, to order that certain subjects are absolutely forbidden to be
discussed.  Currently, the forbidden subject is any discussion of
possible foul  play  in  the  death  of  Princess  Diana  and her
intended husband Dodi Fayed.

Further than that, any discussion  is  forbidden  about  how  the
Official Secrets Act exactly works.  When there is a subject that
an  editor,  publisher,  or  station  manager  believes  would be
covered by the Official Secrets Act, they must immediately inform
the London government.  And if  the London government issues what
they call a "D Notice," then these media outlets  throughout  the
UK  are  not  only  forbidden  to  go forward with any story that
they're working on; but also, the  D Notice serves as a potential
seizure:  it authorizes the UK, through their various operatives,
to immediately seize and close down any printing plant that is in
the process of printing such a story, any radio station,  or  any
radio  or  TV  transmitter.   They  are immediately seized by the
London government, closed  down,  and  the publisher, the editor,
and the key personnel (including the writer  of  the  story)  are
immediately put under arrest.

And  the  worst  part of it is, the rest of the media is not even
allowed to mention that these people have been arrested and their
publishing and transmitting  facilities  seized.  In other words,
it is forbidden to discuss the D Notice  and  also  forbidden  to
discuss  the technical operation of the Official Secrets Act. So,
there is censorship regarding the instruments of censorship.

The journalists I spoke  with  generally  agree with what I found
out  from  other  sources  about  how  Diana  was   assassinated.
Apparently  another  car,  a  supposed  "decoy  car" which was to
protect her, in fact carried  agents of British Intelligence.  It
came up behind the Mercedes which Diana and the  others  were  in
and  hit  it  in  some way.  And there was already an arrangement
through others that  a  chemical  slick  was  put  on the roadway
within the tunnel.  Ahead of  the  slick,  a  heavy  construction
truck, on signal, backed into the tunnel and dropped or placed an
obstruction  of a very heavy nature in the roadway.  So any which
way it turned around, the Diana car could not have gotten away.

Thereafter,  British  Intelligence  planted  disinformation  (and
continues to do so) throughout the world.  (For example, "The car
came from a junkyard;  it  was  formerly stolen; it's a defective
car," "The driver was drunk," "The speedometer was stuck at  120;
the  car  was going over 100 mph.") There's been a flood of these
fake stories promoted worldwide by British Intelligence, in which
the CIA has seen to  it  that the American press replicates these
stories.

Leading journalists in the UK agree with stories by me and others
that Diana was assassinated.   And  the  simple  reason  for  the
murder  is,  British  Intelligence  is  pledged  to  protect  the
monarchy.  The monarchy was *not* going to have a new step-father
for the heir to the throne, Prince William; they weren't going to
have a Moslem.

Further than that, it comes out that Diana had already been given
an  engagement  ring  by  Dodi Fayed.  What has *not* come out is
that she was 3-months pregnant.

So when you put that  together, British Intelligence, under their
rules, was  "justified"  in  wiping  these  people  out  for  the
purposes  of the monarchy, protection of the realm, and "national
security."
