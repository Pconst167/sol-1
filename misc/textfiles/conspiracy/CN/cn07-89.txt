TEDDY BEAR TIME
ADMIRAL BOORDA: GONE TO GLORY
=============================
 
Yes, sometimes  a  suicide  really  is  a  suicide.   And  let me
emphasize that at this point we don't have all the facts.
 
But, sometimes  a  "suicide"  is  something  else.   Sometimes  a
"boating  accident"  is  something else also.  At this point it's
hard to say for  sure  what  happened,  but  here  is what I have
gathered so far, from early press reports and other sources.
 
Admiral Boorda is said to have  been  a short man, about 5 feet 6
inches or less.  It has also been reported that he  shot  himself
in  the chest with a shotgun.  This would be hard for a tall man,
with long arms, to accomplish.   It  would be even more difficult
for the presumably shorter-armed Boorda.
 
Early  reports hinted that Boorda had been "caught in the act" of
wearing a "v" for valor emblem on his uniform.  Boorda supposedly
felt disgraced and it is  hinted  that this led to his "suicide".
Yet Boorda himself had already issued a statement indicating  the
issue  was  no  big deal, words to the effect of "I had thought I
was qualified to wear the  'v' emblem but was informed otherwise.
I have accordingly stopped wearing it."
 
Admiral  Boorda  had  risen  to  the  rank  of  Chief  of   Naval
Operations;  he  was  the highest ranking Navy officer and was on
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Hence this death absolutely *demands*
that a full, *open* investigation be conducted.  The late Admiral
Boorda presumably was  of  higher  equivalent  rank than the late
Vincent W. Foster, Jr. His death deserves that  public  officials
must  strive  to  avoid the appearance of cover-up.  Will they do
so?  Or will they make "mistakes" again?
 
Sherman  Skolnick, in his latest recorded message (312-731-1100),
sees a larger significance in  the Admiral's death.  Reminding us
of recent (and not so recent) history, he points to the April 17,
1995 Alabama  plane  crash  which  killed  high-ranking  military
personnel, the Bosnian plane crash that killed Commerce Secretary
Ron  Brown,  and  the  recent  death  by  "boating accident/heart
attack" of former  CIA  Director  William  Colby,  as  links in a
chain.  Is Boorda's death part of  a  bigger  picture?   Are  all
these violent deaths connected somehow, a part of something going
on beneath the surface, something *we* aren't allowed to see?
 
According  to  Mr.  Skolnick,  a long-time investigator into such
matters,  a  homicide  investigation  team  was  turned  away, at
gunpoint, from the Washington Navy  Yard  where  Boorda  is  said
(already)  to  have been an "apparent suicide".  This smacks of a
similar dispute of  jurisdiction  in  Dallas  in 1963, when JFK's
corpse was whisked away to Washington, D.C. and away from  Dallas
County authorities.
 
Supposedly  *two*  "suicide  notes"  were  found,  according   to
television  broadcasts.   Not  said is that this information most
likely comes from federal  authorities,  the same authorities who
are said to have blocked the  homicide  investigation  team  from
investigating.   These  would  also be the same federal types who
"discovered" the "suicide note"  of  the  late Deputy White House
Counsel Foster.
 
Chuck Hayes, whistleblower  on  insider  skullduggery, misses his
Value Jet flight,  which  then  explodes  in  mid-air;  Bob  Dole
startles  us  all  by  suddenly  abandoning  his  powerful Senate
position; and Bill Clinton is seen  wiping a little tear from his
eye:  Hey. What's going on?
