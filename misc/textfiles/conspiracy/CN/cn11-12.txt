FRENZIED FINANCE -- IV
======================
[Synopsis of *Frenzied Finance* by Thomas 
W. Lawson. New York: Ridgway-Thayer, 1905]

                 -+- The "Magic" of Finance -+-

The majority still regard the  world  of  finance as the world of
magic.  "The magic of finance" is one of the artifices with which
tricksters, since the beginning of the world, have  imposed  upon
the people.

The  average  American  would  consider it a huge joke should his
grocer undertake to  induce  him  to  buy  one-hundred times more
sugar than he could use, on the ground that he might find in  the
sugar  bags,  when he reached home, gold and diamonds.  And so it
goes in  every  business  but  finance.   In  that  business, the
business into which is merged  all  other  businesses,  the  most
hard-headed  of  Americans  are  done out of their savings by the
veriest "come-ons."

[CN:  A more recent version  of  the  racket  was seen in the S&L
debacle of the 1980s.   In  that  scheme,  American  savers  were
robbed,  but  the robbery was smoothed over by FSLIC "insurance."
*But who was  made  to  pay  to  cover  that  insurance?* Not the
robbers, but the American people.]

Look up and down Wall  Street  at  the  great  office  buildings.
These  are  huge  hives of expensive bees who, from New Year's to
New Year's, do not *produce*  a dollar.  The hundreds of millions
spent each year for the expense of running the  "System's"  game,
and  the  millions which the game-makers flaunt, are derived from
the men and women who *produce*.

It is the phenomenon of the age that millions of people come each
year (or each cycle),  of  their  own  free will, to the shearing
pens of the "System," so that the "System" may go  through  their
pockets,  and  they  then depart peacefully home to dig and delve
for more money that they may have the debasing operation repeated
on them in the next cycle.

You may ask  if  I  desire  to  convey  the  idea  that the great
financial institutions and trusts of  this  country,  which  have
their  head  centre  in  Wall  Street,  are  all  concerned  in a
conspiracy to rob the people of their savings.  I desire to go on
record right here  in  declaring  that all financial institutions
which in any way are engaged in taking from the people the  money
that  is  their  surplus  earnings  or  their  capital,  for  the
ostensible  purpose  of safeguarding it, or putting it in use for
them, or exchanging  it  for  stocks,  bonds,  policies, or other
paper evidences of worth, are a part of  the  machinery  for  the
plundering of the people.

I  do not mean to say that all the men who handle and control the
different institutions I mentioned  have  guilty knowledge of the
bearing of their actions.  They do not  know  that  the  relation
between  their  own  minor  institution and the general financial
structure constitutes  the  former  an  agency  for the "System,"
which controls and has organized the general financial  structure
into  an instrument for converting the money of the public to its
own purposes.   In  fact,  the  "System"  has cunningly possessed
itself of the financial mechanism of the country and  is  running
it  for  the benefit and personal profit of its votaries.  And so
the vast correlated organization  of  banks, trust companies, and
insurance corporations has become an agency for transferring  the
people's savings to the control of unscrupulous manipulators.

It  is  only  a matter of simple mathematics to ascertain the day
when ten men  will  be  as  absolutely  and  completely the legal
owners of the entire United States and all there is of  value  in
it,  as  John  D.  Rockefeller is the absolute legal owner of the
large section of it which he today possesses.

When that day is here, the  people  will legally be the slaves of
these ten men.

The American people have been lulled to  sleep  by  the  "System"
until  they  have  but  a  dull appreciation not only of existing
conditions  but  of  their  coming  consequences.   It  is almost
incredible that a people as intelligent as  the  American  people
can  be  so  deceived  and juggled with.  However, when one looks
about and notes  the  degradation  and  dishonor  to which public
opinion is seemingly indifferent, nothing is incredible.

The "System" has so far been able to keep the public in ignorance
of its doings.  On the surface there is nothing to suggest that a
set of vampires have captured the high places of finance and  are
sucking  away  the life-blood of the nation.  Our banks and trust
companies all present a fair exterior and apparently are the same
safe and  honorable  institutions  they  were  before  the canker
fastened on them.  Only its votaries know what the  "System"  is,
and  their  way  is  the  way  of  silence  and darkness.  A tie,
stronger and more effective  than  the  oath  of the Mafia, binds
them to its service, and woe be to  him  who  dares  divulge  its
methods.   And  even  if  the  being be found who will venture an
expose' of the conspiracy, he will find it strangely difficult to
get his story past the  traps  and  pitfalls which will be placed
between it and the public.
