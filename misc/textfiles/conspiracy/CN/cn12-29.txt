Review by Conspiracy Nation

Robert Anton Wilson dedicates his  latest  book, in part, to Mimi
Hill, a "wonderfully efficient Websearcher."  Mimi ought to  take
a  bow  since  she has indeed come up with a lot of material that
even the  august  Conspiracy  Nation  had  not  known previously.
(Examples later.)

The book,  "Everything  is  Under  Control,"  is  a  wide-ranging
compendium of various conspiracy "theories," and includes sources
for  those  wishing  to delve further into a particular "theory."
In its all-encompassing  coverage  of various conspiracy stories,
Wilson's  book  follows  trails  already   blazed   by   previous
cataloguers  such as Jonathan Vankin, Kenn Thomas, Al Hidell, and
Donna  Kossy.   Wilson's  book  offers  a  good  crash  course in
conspiracy "theories" for the beginner and  has  new  information
for the experienced connoisseur.

Wilson   himself  is  a  hard  person  to  figure  out.   In  his
introduction, he distances himself  from conspiracy "theories" in
general, declaring that "Conspiracy theories  flourish  in  times
and  places  of  anxiety  and  uncertainty"  and that the various
"theories"  renew  his   faith   in  "poetic  imagination."   But
throughout the book itself, Wilson frequently  seems  to  endorse
some of the "theories" as extremely likely.  Then again, he keeps
throwing in references to "The Church of the Sub-Genius," obvious
kooks.  There is a lot of truth camouflaged by kooks, sneers, and
pseudo-intellectualism  in  Wilson's book: did he have to include
the camouflage  in  order  to  get  the  book  past the corporate
censors?  Is Wilson actually  "pushing  the  envelope,"  sneaking
good   information  to  the  public  hidden  beneath  a  pose  of
skepticism?

Here are samples of  various  "theories"  covered by Wilson which
Conspiracy Nation had not previously encountered:

** SOME SAY that the Cain-Abel story "represents lying propaganda
by the carnivores against the vegetarians."  Cain, a  farmer,  is
non-violent  versus  Abel,  a shepherd, who is violent.  (Another
angle on the Cain-Abel story is given by Rene Girard in his book,
"Violence and the Sacred."  "One of the brothers kills the other,
and the murderer is the one who does not have the violence-outlet
of animal sacrifice at his disposal.")

** SOME SAY that John  Adams  had opinions about banks that sound
"shockingly like  some  modern  conspiracy  theorists  and  money
cranks."

**  SOME  SAY that Saint Ambrose of Milan viewed usury as not the
charging of  =excessive=  interest  on  money  loaned  but as the
charging of =any= interest on such loans.   "His  view  therefore
condemns the entire structure of modern finance capitalism..."

** SOME SAY that the death of communism leaves  "malcontents"  as
the only remaining serious opposition to the "money-power elite."
(This  idea  is  echoed  in  Michael Moore's latest, hard to find
movie, "The Big  One."   Moore  suggests  that,  yes, =one= "evil
empire"  is  gone,  but  adds  that  the  =other=  "evil  empire"
remains.) 

** SOME SAY that Ambrose Bierce's later writings (after  *Devil's
Dictionary*)  "deal  increasingly with weird and uncanny subjects
and often concern other worlds or other dimensions of being..."

** SOME SAY  that  "they  listen  to  you  through your telephone
without its being off the hook."

** SOME SAY that the quatrains of Nostradamus "=reveal the past=.
The quatrains tell what really happened in past history."

** SOME SAY that the real and  absolute  money  power  originated
with  the Warburg Bank of Amsterdam "and was part of the 'Orange'
take-over  of  England  and  America,  after  the  mildly illegal
installation of  the  Dutchman  William  of  Orange  as  King  of
England."

There's  a  lot more.  Marina Oswald, widow of Lee Harvey Oswald,
is quoted as saying

  The answer to the Kennedy assassination is with the Federal
  Reserve Bank.   Don't  underestimate  that.   It's wrong to
  blame it on [James Jesus] Angleton and  the  CIA  *per  se*
  only.   This  is  only  one  finger  of the same hand.  The
  people who supply the money are above the CIA.

The late Howard Hughes is  claimed  to  have  believed  that  the
Rockefellers own the U.S. courts and judges.

David  Rockefeller  is claimed, through his Chase Manhattan Bank,
to be a top stockholder  in  the Federal Reserve Bank.  That idea
is  not  delved  into  enough:   The  "Federal"  "Reserve"  is  a
=private= bank; who are the other stockholders?

There's a lot more.  Read the book to find out  some  things  you
didn't know. Then delve into the sources.
