GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]
 
[...continued...]
 
As far as the Independent  Research Service itself, there's quite
a few sources that document the connections  of  the  Independent
Research  Service  to the Central Intelligence Agency.  I'm going
to read one of them, very briefly, right now.
 
The book is called (and it's published in hardcover), it's called
*The Espionage Establishment*,  by  David  Wise  and Thomas Ross.
Published in hardcover by Random House and copyrighted 1974.   In
the  [book] there's a footnote, in which a number of CIA domestic
funding conduits and organizations funded  by the CIA are listed.
The organizations range from some which  are  obviously  not  CIA
fronts  but  have  simply  received  money  from CIA (such as the
National Council of Churches),  to  organizations like Radio Free
Europe which were not only begun, basically, by the CIA  but  for
all  intents  and  purposes  are CIA fronts and always have been.
And in the list (which is  in  alphabetical order -- this, by the
way,  on  page  155  of  *The  Espionage   Establishment*),   the
Independent Research Service is listed right there.
 
Still more information about the Independent Research Service and
just exactly what sorts of functions it performs on behalf of CIA
is  carried in an excellent article that appeared in the Berkeley
Barb.  (Now again,  as  I  indicated,  neither  Nip [co-host] nor
myself endorses the ideological underpinnings  of  a  publication
like the Berkeley Barb.)
 
The  reportage here is excellent and essential, and it represents
the deepest investigation into  the  background of Gloria Steinem
we've been able to come up with.
 
The following article from the Berkeley Barb is from the issue of
May 30th thru June 5th of 1975.  The article is by Gabriel Schang
and it's titled,  "Radical  Women  Won't  Be  Ms.-led."   And  it
concerns Steinem and her whole relation with Independent Research
Service.
 
  Gloria  Steinem,  founder  and  editor  of Ms. magazine and
  president  of  the  Ms.  Corporation,  has  an  association
  spanning  ten   years   with   the   CIA   which   she  has
  misrepresented   and   covered   up.    To   some   people,
  particularly feminists, the relationship seemed obvious, if
  nebulous and difficult to  verify.   Others  will  probably
  remain incredulous until Time magazine finally acknowledges
  it.   And then, there will be people who don't perceive the
  implications of such  a  liaison,  and  still more who will
  simply shrug it off.
 
  A group of women tied-in with the  origins  of  the  modern
  Women's Liberation Movement and concerned about its future,
  who  call  themselves  "Red  Stockings,"  have been able to
  piece together enough  documentation to convincingly expose
  and describe the Ms./Steinem/CIA connection.  Moreover, the
  Red Stockings have closely examined the  financial  backing
  and  contents  of  Ms.  magazine  and  have  arrived at the
  conclusion that the  ideology  put  forth  by  Ms. has been
  positively harmful to the Women's Movement.
 
  The first revelations of Gloria Steinem's  relationship  to
  the  CIA  appeared  in  the  New  York Times in 1967, in an
  article that stated that Steinem  had a part in launching a
  CIA front group which was called the "Independent  Research
  Service."   Just  prior to this exposure, Ramparts magazine
  had disclosed that the organization was CIA-funded.
 
  The purpose of  the  Independent  Research Service seems to
  have  been  to  subvert  communist-minded  youths   on   an
  international basis.  The supposedly "Independent" Research
  Service  was, in fact, totally dependent on the CIA.  It is
  believed to have been  formed  in response to the Communist
  World Youth festivals occurring throughout  the  1950s  and
  1960s.   These  festivals  were held in communist countries
  until 1959, when the  festival  for that year was scheduled
  to take place in Vienna --  neutral  territory  during  the
  Cold  War.  The State Department did its best to discourage
  American youths from attending.   Some  did go, though, and
  in  the  meantime  the  CIA  covertly  arranged   for   the
  Independent  Research Service to organize an anti-communist
  delegation to attend and disrupt the festivals.
 
  In 1967,  Ramparts  exposed  the  intricate  laundering and
  funneling process by which the Independent Research Service
  obtained money from the CIA.  The funds passed through five
  different foundations:  the Borden Trust, the  Price  Fund,
  the Beacon Fund, the Edsel Fund, and the Kentfield Fund, on
  its  way  to the Independent Research Service as well as to
  the National Students Association and other groups.
 
  The  final   channeling   was   accomplished   through  the
  well-known Boston law firm of Hale & Dorr(sp?).  This  same
  law firm produced Joseph Welch as attorney for the Army and
  in  its  confrontations  with  Joseph  McCarthy  and,  more
  recently,  James St. Claire as Nixon's chief counsel during
  the Watergate scandals.
 
(Excuse me.  I was  a  little  confused  at  first.  The law firm
representing Gloria Steinem in her media pressure efforts was not
the same one which was  involved...   [i.e.,  Greenbaum,  Wolf  &
Ernst  are  apparently  not  Nixon-related.] I was confusing that
with the  law  firm  involved  with  setting  up  the Independent
Research Service in the first place.)
 
(Of course, it's still intriguing that this organization would be
so very much involved with  Gloria  Steinem and connecting her to
people like James  St.  Claire  --  Nixon's  counsel  during  the
Watergate  crisis.  The Watergate crisis and its connections with
Katherine  Graham  we're  going  to  be  looking  at,  as  I  had
indicated, a little later.)
 
  No one claims  to  know  why  Gloria  Steinem was chosen to
  found and direct this group.  But two early  organizers  of
  the  Independent Research Service stated, in a New Republic
  article of May 11th, 1959,  that "most of the sponsors have
  had considerable experience in domestic  and  international
  youth and student affairs."
 
  What  in Steinem's past prepared her for this sort of work?
  It is a  matter  of  public  record  that Gloria M. Steinem
  graduated from Smith College and then received the  Chester
  Bowles  Asian  Fellowship  to the Universities of New Delhi
  and Calcutta, in India,  in  1956  thru  1958.  All the Red
  Stockings could glean of her activities  in  India  is  the
  alleged publication of a book in 1957 called, *The Thousand
  Indias*.   Although  the  recent  edition  of *Who's Who in
  America* lists the title of  the  book, all attempts by Red
  Stocking to find it in past  or  current  listings  of  the
  Cumulative  Book  Index  listings  of  the  New York Public
  Library *Books in Print*  and  the Library of Congress were
  unsuccessful.  The very existence of Steinem's book  cannot
  be  determined,  let  alone its contents or the identity of
  the publisher.
 
  According to the recent  Red  Stocking press release, and a
  February 21st,  1967  interview  in  the  New  York  Times,
  Steinem  was described as "a full-time Independent Research
  Service employee  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts,  from 1959
  until after the Helsinki Youth Festival  in  1962."   Under
  media   pressure,   Steinem   could  not  disavow  her  CIA
  association.   But  she  gave   a  distorted  view  of  her
  activities at the festivals.  Steinem claims all the  group
  did  at the two festivals was establish a newspaper, a news
  bureau, cultural exhibits, and jazz clubs.  The groups most
  important work, she said,  was convincing youths from Asia,
  Africa, and Latin America that there  were  some  Americans
  who  understood  and  cared about their situation.  Steinem
  emphasized, "I was never asked to report on other Americans
  or assess foreign nationals I had met."
