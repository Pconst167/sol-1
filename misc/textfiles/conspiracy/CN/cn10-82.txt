FOSTER'S DOCUMENTS
==================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------

Hundreds and  hundreds  of  documents  have  been  obtained by us
purporting to incriminate George Bush acting  jointly  with  Bill
and Hillary Clinton in various efforts with their confederates to
foment  foreign  wars,  topple governments not favored by the spy
agencies, and carry  out  political  assassinations.  The records
show a pattern of  bank  accounts,  intelligence  agency  "front"
companies,  called proprietaries, and the transfers of huge funds
arranged and carried out by a super money-handler, namely Vincent
W. Foster, Jr., for some  ten  years before he became briefly, in
1993, Clinton White House Deputy Counsel.

The bank checks, made out to "cash" and  signed  by  Foster,  are
written  in the millions of dollars on banks as far flung as Hong
Kong, Singapore, Iraq, Kuwait, Spain, France, and elsewhere.  The
dates on the documents  start  about  1983 and end shortly before
the strange death of Foster (some say murder) in July, 1993.

Retired intelligence sources, who have examined the documents and
have been aware of their existence for  some  time,  contend  the
records   are  genuine  and  tend  to  show  high-level  criminal
activities, perceived by some as treasonous:

  ** ITEM:  George  Bush,  Henry  Kissinger & Associates, and
  others, reportedly implicated in setting off  the  downfall
  of  the  Yugoslav  government  in Belgrade at the same time
  financing the  civil  war  in  Bosnia,  including financing
  clandestine weapons shipments to the combatants.

  ** ITEM:  Use of  an  Arkansas  state  agency,  while  Bill
  Clinton  was  Governor,  to transfer millions of dollars to
  foreign bank accounts for covert activities that apparently
  included political assassinations  forbidden  under the CIA
  guidelines following the U.S. Senate investigations of  the
  spy  agency in the 1970s.  The Arkansas Development Finance
  Authority (ADFA) was  apparently  a  front  for the Central
  Intelligence Agency as well as the National Security Agency
  (NSA).  As the head of a secret team of NSA, Foster  had  a
  rank  equivalent  to general and almost unlimited authority
  to arrange, transfer,  and  allocate  huge funds, under the
  supervision of Henry Hyde, head of the CIA  "black  budget"
  at the same time he has been a congressman from the Chicago
  area. Foster was the signatory on many of the documents.

  **  ITEM:   Foster  headed a clandestine team that included
  George Bush and Ollie  North,  together with Hillary Rodham
  Clinton, and Webster Hubbell, former Chief Justice  of  the
  Arkansas  Supreme  Court,  former  Little  Rock  mayor, and
  third-in-command of  the  Justice  Department  in Clinton's
  first term as President.

  ** ITEM:  Hillary Clinton was reportedly a  director  of  a
  weapons  firm  in  which George Bush was a principal owner.
  On a  clandestine  basis  they  supplied  weapons  to Iraq,
  including ingredients for the  manufacture  by  the  Bagdad
  government of poison gas.

  **  ITEM:   The documents were reportedly unearthed by Lisa
  Foster's step-son, Neal Cooper Moody, from his stepmother's
  properties.  Moody, 29, became her step-son when the  widow
  of  Vince  Foster  remarried  to  James  Maxwell  Moody, an
  Arkansas lawyer.  Lisa,  upon  being  married, had Neal and
  his father move into her  house,  and  pressured  President
  Clinton  to  appoint  her  new  husband as Federal District
  Judge  in  Arkansas.   Clinton   was   quick  to  make  the
  appointment since he was aware of the documents.
     Neal Moody reportedly  told  close  friends  in  August,
  1996,  that  he  had  certain "records" and was about to be
  rich.   The  young  Moody  met  with  a  reporter  from the
  Washington Post, believed to be Bob Woodward  of  Watergate
  fame  or  someone  on  his  behalf.   [CN:   A copy of this
  article, "Foster's Documents"  by  Sherman H. Skolnick, has
  been faxed to Mr. Woodward, and his comments  are  awaited.
  In  case  he has lost or somehow not received this article,
  you may want to fax an extra copy to him at 202-334-6581.]
     The younger  Moody  was  reportedly  promised  a million
  dollars by the Washington Post who ostensibly  promised  to
  go  with  the  story  on  the  second  day  of the Democrat
  Convention in Chicago.   As  Moody  understood the plan, he
  was to be available either inside the  Convention  Hall  or
  right  nearby, so that the 15,000 journalists from all over
  the world gathered there  would  be  bound to interview him
  and go with  the  story.   The  publicity  was  planned  to
  torpedo Clinton's expected re-nomination by the Convention.
  Al  Gore,  then  Vice-President,  was to be the replacement
  nominee for U.S. President.  Gore apparently was made aware
  of the documents and/or knew  about Neal Cooper Moody.  The
  scheme did not work, in that  Moody  was  murdered  on  the
  Sunday   before   the   opening   day  of  the  Convention.
  Authorities  claimed  his  car  somehow,  in  Little  Rock,
  lurched  from  a  parking  lot  near  a  restaurant  into a
  concrete abutment.  Investigators found out that there  was
  not enough distance from where the car started to get up to
  speed  to  cause  his  death.   Witnesses claim he had been
  sitting in the car  arguing  with someone.  Moody alone was
  found dead in the auto.

  ** ITEM:  Some contend that a group of  top  U.S.  military
  brass want something done against their Commander-in-Chief,
  Bill  Clinton,  who  they  accuse of treason, and have been
  planning to arrest  him  under  provisions  of the Military
  Code.  They apparently also would join with Vice  President
  Al  Gore to remove Clinton under the provisions of the 25th
  Amendment, in that Clinton  is  unfit  and cannot carry out
  his duties under the  Constitution  as  President  and  has
  committed treason against the American people.  Independent
  Counsel  Kenneth  W.  Starr  has  been covering up the Neal
  Moody documents since the  beginning  of his appointment in
  1994.  His excuse?  It would tend to  scandalize  the  U.S.
  government.    (Also,   Kenneth   Starr  is  reportedly  an
  unregistered lobbyist  for  Red  China,  subject himself to
  arrest.)

And, all this relates to a recent extended meeting  between  Vice
President Al Gore and Chicago Mayor Richie Daley.

(More-independent  commentators  and  journalists  are  urged  to
