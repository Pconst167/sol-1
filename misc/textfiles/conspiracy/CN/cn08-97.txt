8/7/96, INTELLIGENCE REPORT: Brain Implant For Dissidents Soon
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

JOHN STADTMILLER:
This was a confidential report that was put through the
"Intelli-Connection", Security Division of IBM Corporation
                                        [October 20, 1995].

It was [marked] "CONFIDENTIAL".  It was [marked] 
"LIMITED DISTRIBUTION ONLY".   "LEVEL-9 COMMUNICATION."  It is on
the "20/20 Neutral [microelectronic] Chip [brain] Implant."
  
Folks: Pay  Close  Attention  to  This !

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *    *
  "The control of crime will be of paramount concern in the 21st 
   Century. We must be ready with our security products when the 
   demand for them becomes popular. Our Research and Development
   Division has been in contact with the Federal Bureau of Prisons,
   the California Department of Corrections, the Texas Department of
   Public Safety, and the Massachusetts Department of Corrections   
   to run limited trials of the 20/20 Neutral Chip Implant. 
   
  "We have established representatives of our interests in both 
   management and institutional-level positions with these 
   departments."

In other words, they've got their insiders in there.

  "Federal regulations do not permit testing of implants on 
   prisoners, but we have entered into contractual agreements with
   privatized health care professionals and specified correctional 
   personnel to do limited testing of our products. We also have had
   major successes, in privately-owned sanitariums, with implant
   technology."

  "We need, however, to expand our testing to research how effective
   the 20/20 Neutral Chip Implant performs in those people 
   identified as most aggressive in our society."

[JD: Holocaust history forebodes that they will ultimately implant
 chips in the targeted segments of this Amerikan Society:
 Black people, Hispanic people, homosexual dissidents, leftwing
 dissidents, patriotic Constitutionist dissidents, militia members,
 Christians who believe in the second coming of Christ (a la the
 Branch Davidian Christians), Orthodox Judaists, and others. 
 Who has forgotten Hitler's Dr. Mengele and his barbaric human
 medical experiments?  It can, and will, happen here in Amerika
 ... because Hitlers and Mengeles are among the bad seeds of ALL
 humanity, and, hence, they sprout up just as well in 1996 Amerika
 as in 1936 Germany.]

  "Limited testing has produced a number of results."

  "In California, several prisoners were identified as members of
   the `security threat group,' E.M.E., or Mexican Mafia. They were
   brought to the Health Services Unit at Pelican Bay and 
   tranquilized with advanced sedatives developed by our Cambridge,
   Massachusetts laboratory."

  "The implant procedure takes 60 to 90 minutes, depending upon the 
   experience of the technician. We are working on a device which 
   will reduce that time by as much as sixty percent."

  "The results of implants on eight prisoners yielded the following 
   results: Implants served as surveillance monitoring devices for 
   `threat group' activity.
   Implants disabled two subjects during an assault on correctional 
   staff members."

  "Universal side effects in all eight test subjects revealed that 
   when their implants were set to 116 megahertz ...."

   [JD: This means that, transmitted into the subjects' brains, was 
    an electric current or an electromagnetic field which oscillates
    in amplitude at a frequency of 116 million cycles every second.]


  "Universal side effects in all eight test subjects revealed that
   when the implant was set to [a frequency of] 116 megahertz, all  
   subjects became lethargic and slept on an average of 18 to 22    
   hours per day. All subjects refused recreation periods for  
   fourteen days during the 116 megahertz test evaluation. Seven out
   of the eight subjects did not exercise inside the cell or outside
   of the cell, and five of the eight subjects refused showers for 
   up to three days at a time."

  "Each subject was monitored for aggressive activity during the
   test period, and findings are conclusive that seven out of eight 
   test subjects exhibited no aggression, even when provoked."

  "Each subject experienced only minor bleeding from the nose and
   ears 48 hours after the initial chip implant adjustment."

  "Each subject had no knowledge of his implant for the test period,
   and each implant was retrieved under the guise of `medical 
   treatment.'"

  "It should be noted that the test period was less than two months.
   However, during that period, substantial data which was gathered 
   by a research and development team would suggest that the 
   implants exceed expected results."

  "One of the major concerns of security in the research and 
   development team was that the test subject would discover the 
   chemical imbalance during the intial adjustment period, and that 
   the test would have to be scrubbed.  However, due to advanced 
   technology developments in the sedatives administered, the 
   48-hour adjustment period can be attributed to the prescription 
   medication given to the test subjects after the implant 
   procedure."

  "One of the concerns raised by the Research and Development
   [staff] was the cause of the bleeding, and how to eliminate
   the problem. Unexplained bleeding might cause `the subject' to 
   inquire further about his routine visits to the infirmary or 
   other health care facility."

  "The security windfall for the brief test period was enormous.
   Security officials now reveal several strategies employed by the
   E.M.E. that facilitate the transmission of illegal drugs and 
   weapons into the correctional facilities. One intelligence 
   officer remarked that, though they cannot use the information
   they have in a court of law, they now know who to watch, and what
   outside connections they have."

  "The prison at Solidad [in California] is now considering 
   transferring three subjects to Vacaville where they have ongoing
   implant research. Our technicians have promised that they can do
   three 20/20 Neutral Chip Implants in less than an hour. Solidad
   Prison officials hope to collect information from the trio to 
   bring to a close a 14-month investigation into drug trafficking 
   by corrections officers."

  "Essentially, these implants make the unsuspecting prisoner a 
   walking, talking recording of every event that he comes into 
   contact with."

  "There are only five intelligence officers and the Commissioner 
   of Corrections who actually know the full scope of the implant
   testing."

  "In Massachusetts, the Department of Corrections has already 
   entered into high-level discussions about releasing certain
   offenders, with the 20/20 Neutral Chip Implant, into the 
   community."
   
  "Our people are not altogether against the idea.  However, 
   attorneys at the Intelli-Connection have advised against implant
   technology outside of strict control settings. Under the present 
   governmental structure, our liability would be enormous."

  "We have a strong lobby in the Congress and in various state
   legislatures favoring our product."

  "We must proceed with the utmost caution in the uncontrolled use
   of the 20/20 Neutral Chip Implant. If the chip were discovered in
   use not authorized by law, and the procedures traced to us, we
   could not endure for long the resulting publicity and liability
   payments."

  "Massachusetts officials have developed an intelligence branch 
   from their Fugitive Task Force squad that would do limited test
   runs under tight controls with pre-release subjects. Corrections
   officials have dubbed these potential test subjects 
   `the insurance group,' the name derived from the concept that the
   20/20 Implant insures compliance with the law, and allows 
   officials to detect misconduct or violations without 
   question[ing]."

  "A retired police detective from Charlestown, Massachusetts, now
   with the Intelligence Unit, has asked us to consider using the
   20/20 Neutral Chip Implant on Charlestown felons suspected of 
   bank and armored car robberies.  He stated: `Charlestown would
   never be the same. We'd probably know what was happening before
   THEY knew what was happening.'"

  "We will continue to explore community uses of the 20/20 Neutral
   Chip Implant, and our company representatives would be attached
   to all law enforcement operations, with an `extraction crew'
   that could be on-site in two hours, from anywhere, at any time."

  "We have Intelli-Connection discussion groups who are meeting with
   the Director of Security at Florence, Colorado's Federal Super- 
   Maximum Security Prison. The initial discussions with the
   director have been promising. We hope to have a Research and
   Development Unit at this important facility within the next
   six months. ADX Florence Company has replaced Marion, Illinois
   as the Federal Prison System's ultra-maximum security unit."

  "Efforts of the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch 
   continue to legalize the implant technology (See the Intelli-
   Connection Internal Memorandum #15)."
