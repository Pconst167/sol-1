AUTHORS REPLY

Mary Todd was sitting to the right of  Lincoln.   With  her  left
hand  she  was  able to reach behind Lincolns back very naturally
without any strain and point the gun to the lower left skull area
of Lincoln's head.  Linda, I  and others believe Abe probably had
his head on Marys left shoulder and he was resting or was  asleep
thus  making  the shot even easier.  With Abe resting his head on
Mary's left shoulder, the right  side  of his lower skull was not
accessible to Mary's left hand with the gun.  Do you get it now?

AUTHORS REPLY

Linda Goodman died three years  ago.   She shared with me all her
findings over the 35 years of research.  I am  trying  to  secure
those papers, picture, etc via her family as soon as possible.

AUTHORS REPLY

Checked  my  notes and source books again and you are right about
the date but  very  wrong  and  a  continuing  victim of the spin
doctors if you believe the fake Booth commited suicide.  But  his
pickled  body  was paraded to small towns in the Midwest and West
for over a year.   And  how  does  one  account for the certified
affidavit by Lincoln's Cousin?  Will provide  copy  in  about  30
days.

AUTHORS REPLY

My communication is not based upon "ideas" but evidence and facts
that  are then pieced together for an insight into the truth.  My
research does not include  the Garfield / McKinley assassinations
so I have no evidence or facts to piece together.

AUTHORS REPLY

Andrew Jackson did not stop the United States  Constitution  Bank
that  became  the  Federal  Reserve Bank in 1813.  This bank with
different names was  and  still  is  located  in Charlotte, North
Carolina.  This bank does not have any connection with  the  Bank
Of  The  United  States.   The  Rothschilds  and  Bank of England
controlling the  gold  mines  of  North  Carolina  with a private
banking institution for over  250  years  is  still  one  of  the
greatest secrets of all time.

AUTHORS REPLY

No  -  Hapsburg  is not correct.  Keep Trying!  88 and his family
are for real.  Also one of  the  son's  of 88 Senior had the same
name and was into numerology and called himself 88  Junior.   And
remember  the true Lincoln Saga is more far out than any piece of
fiction.

Additional comments by Conspiracy Nation and by a reader
--------------------------------------------------------

*Somebody's* pickled body *was* displayed after the 1903 death of
"the Enid man" (I say it  was Booth; the anonymous author says it
was a Booth double.)  Supporting the claim that  "the  Enid  man"
was  Booth  is  the  following  excerpt from CN 3.91, "Escape and
Suicide of John Wilkes Booth."

  [CfD -- Finis L. Bates notes  that "the foregoing are a few
  of the many comments made  in  the  various  publications."
  *Unsolved Mysteries* covered  this  story.   Following  are
  excerpts.  Note that the person named "Orwellek" (sp?)  has
  been investigating aspects of the Lincoln assassination for
  years.]

  ORWELLEK:  Bates  had  the  body  preserved.   He took many
  pictures  of  the  body.   Eventually,  he  had  the   body
  mummified to preserve it  for  posterity; to prove once and
  for  all that the government had fooled us all.  And he was
  not going to allow that cover-up to stand.

  NARRATOR:  In  1931,  six  Chicago  physicians examined the
  mummified  body of John St. Helen [a.k.a.  David E. George,
  John Wilkes  Booth].   According  to  the  findings of this
  affidavit, they specifically noted a scarred right eyebrow,
  a crushed right thumb and a broken-limbed leg.  John Wilkes
  Booth is known  to  have  had  all  three  of these unusual
  characteristics.

Regarding the mysterious reference to "88"  (such  mysteriousity,
in  itself,  arouses my suspicions; why not just come out and say
it?),

  [11] Regarding cryptic reference  to  "88" and "what is 8th
  letter  of  alphabet":  8th letter of alphabet is "H," ...

one Conspiracy Nation reader suggests that "88" ("HH") means

  howard hughes, perhaps?

Or maybe "88"  ("HH")  means  "Hubert  Humphrey?"   Or  "Hannibal
Hamlin?"   (If  readers  have  other  ideas,  please  forward  to
Conspiracy Nation.)

The  anonymous  author  has  most  intriguing  ideas,  and future
reports from him are welcomed.
