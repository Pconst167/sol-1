O.J. SIMPSON CASE CONNECTED TO FEDS
===================================
By "Rhea Fortean" (pseudonym)
-----------------------------

I have been  rereading  *LA  Secret  Police* (by Mike Rothmiller;
ISBN:   0-671-79657-7)  looking  for  the  info  on  the  Witness
Protection Program haven of So. California.

One thing I've noticed that struck me stronger this time since  I
know  of  Fred  Celeni  [1]  and  other  info is that MUCH of the
intelligence gathering that was done  (and maybe still is) was of
a POLITICAL  nature.   Politicians,  city  council  members,  the
mayor,  even  other  higher ups in the police department.  Also a
concentration on sports  figures,  players  and owners, managers,
etc.  This info that they gathered was used to blackmail and gain
influence from people in a position to  help  out  the  LAPD  and
their  causes.   Much  of  it  was  about  getting  power through
blackmail.

Some  of  the "operations" they did where they ran businesses out
of business with harassment from city agencies (inspectors, etc.)
would  fit  right  in  with   "black  bag"  operations  that  the
government might do.  Also he tells of finding  "criminals"  with
phone  numbers to the CIA and FBI (unlisted numbers).  That shows
that the CIA IS working w/in the US (but no real surprise).  Also
finding criminals with government "cover".

Reading it now (after Celeni)  makes  the chill up my spine worse
than before.

Joe Domanick of TO SERVE AND  TO  PROTECT  called  Vannatter  and
Lange  some  of  Gate's  "Golden Boys" on E! tv at the end of the
Simpson trial.  He also  said  that  Gates STILL CONTROLLED THESE
PEOPLE.  Said he still has access to the Intelligence Files  that
were  supposed to have been destroyed.  Said Gates took them with
him.

Brian,  do  you  have  a  contact  number  or  address  for  Mike
Rothmiller of LA Secret Police?   I  would  love to have a way of
writing him.  An email?  Fax?  Anything will do.   [CN:   Anybody
who knows, contact bigred@shout.net]

If ALL CITIES have the Intelligence Files and I believe  they  do
or  have  had  since  the  70's when the Fed government made it a
"condition" for getting Federal Funds---  do you realize how much
can be controlled  by  the  government?   Crimes,  arrests,  non-
arrests,  blackmail,  black bag operations, stings, "set ups" (as
I've come to believe the Marv Albert thing was----someone knew of
his  "side"  activities   and   used  it),  blackmailed  support,
financial support, etc. etc, etc.

Rothmiller also said the DEA was using one criminal to  get  info
to  help one gang over another.  (Arrest all the ones in one gang
to give an advantage to another gang.)

Excellent.

When I locate the info on the Fed program from the 70's  and  fed
money, I'll send it.  I just have to relocate it in THE BLUEGRASS
CONSPIRACY.

  THE BLUEGRASS CONSPIRACY
  by Sally Denton
  Pg.47 

  The CIA's Office of Security in 1966 began training certain
  police  officers throughout the United States, and had made
  overtures to him.  The training  courses, held at the CIA's
  compound near Washingon, D.C., included declassification of
  materials,   foreign   weapons,   COUNTERAUDIO    MEASURES,
  explosive  devices and detection techniques, BASIC THEORIES
  OF INTELLIGENCE AND  CLANDESTINE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION,
  COVERT PHOTOGRAPHY, AND PHOTOANALYSIS, and Ralph found that
  he was a quick study.

(How many cops trained this way since 66?)

  In 1968 Congress created a special appendage of the Justice
  Department to  financially  assist  state  and local police
  departments in battling  new,  complex  national crime wave
  that  had  accompanied the riots and demonstrations.  Every
  police agency in the  country  scrambled  to obtain the Law
  Enforcement Assistance  Administration  money  allocated by
  the federal  government,  which  was  DISHED  OUT  ONLY  TO
  AGENCIES THAT ESTABLISHED INTELLIGENCE UNITS.

(this came to Kentucky in 1969---could California NOT  have  done
this then---don't think so.)

So we have all  these  cops  trained  as  spies with knowledge of
bombs, surveillance, etc. wiretaps included in this.   All  these
cops CIA trained.

Remember  the  Round  Up in Tennessee that was investigated about
the time of  the  Simpson  case  where  the agents showed racism.
Remember that local cops, DEA, FBI,  etc.  were  there  TOGETHER.
THE GOOD OLE BOYS ROUNDUP.

They  didn't  want  the videos out and harassed the militia group
who took the videos.  Could  the  CIA have been there too?  Maybe
some LA cops were there?

We have trained cops now all over the US that could do black  bag
jobs, surveillance, wiretaps, etc.====trained by CIA.

If the Fed money came ONLY if the dept. had an intelligence unit,
how  many  do  you  think turned it down.  NOT MANY I'd say.  Has
this training continued?

Were  these  guys   getting   security   clearances  or  security
background checkups?

Fuhrman of all the cops in Simpson case fits the type of guy  for
this  kind  of training.  He was younger, a hunter (familiar with
and admits to camping  out  and  survival training), very bright,
etc.

Are these trained cops now used to do black bag jobs in the  name
of "national security", undercover into militias, etc.?

ALL books on RFK mention the close ties of LAPD, FBI, and CIA and
how  some  officers  flow  back  and  forth from LAPD to govern't
agencies and back again.

Brad Roberts? the hidden  LAPD  officer  on the scene.  Fuhrman's
so-called real partner?

If you have this book and have read it, think  back  or  look  up
Anita  Madden--rich  horsefarm matron who probably dealt in drugs
as a sideline.

Don't think I've told you this before but I  have  told  Sherman.
In  1995 (during the OJ trial) she managed to have Kato Kaelin as
a houseguest and Derby Party  guest.   He came to Lexington a few
times after that and may have met with her then.  Do you  realize
how difficult it would have been to contact Kato at that time and
get  him  to  come  to  your  house  in Ky.--(a total stranger?)?
Somebody had to vouch for her.

Also, this past May for the Derby Party she has annually, she had
both  Geraldo Rivera and Phil Vannatter as guests.  I was sort of
surprised she didn't have  the  Goldman's  since Fred has taken a
liking to our state and has been here numerous times.

The tv station does an hour live remote from the party each  year
(it's  that  big  a  deal)  and  both  Rivera  and Vannatter were
interviewed.  Both were smashed and made for a strange interview.
The women  were  hanging  all  over  Geraldo  and  Vannatter kept
praising Geraldo for doing such a "good job" (ala OJ).

I had predicted to Sherman that they-- at least  Vannatter  would
come.   Vannatter  has been to Lexington numerous times also.  He
gets on radio talk shows and tv interviews and just loses it.  He
starts telling the biggest  whoppers  you  have ever heard of the
trial, the evidence, the timeline, you name it.

Anita  Madden  (Bluegrass  Conspiracy)  was  right  in there with
Lambert, John Y. Brown, Jr., Dan Lassater (Bill Clinton), and the
whole crew.  She knew Melanie  Flynn  who was killed (probably by
Lexington cops).  J. Brown, Jr. was married to  the  ex  wife  of
Robert  Evans  of  Paramount  Pictures  fame---the  Heidi  Fleiss
case--and   had   been   the   lover   of   Denise   Brown  years
before---connected  to  drugs---tied  in  with  the  Cotton  Club
murder---etc.

The Brentwood-Lexington connection is strong.  Brown himself  was
very  wealthy (owner of Ky. Fried Chicken) at one time.  He was a
big time  gambler  and  other  connections  that  ruined  him for
another term as governor once it came out.

I may be wrong but I don't think Vannatter  has  been  on  tv  or
radio  since I called in and called him a liar who took advantage
of most people not  knowing  the  facts  of  the evidence and the
testimony when he told his lies.  He was NOT happy with  me.   He
did  come  to  the  Madden  party  though.   I also made sure the
hostess of the radio/tv  shows  got  a  copy of an itemization of
each lie he told along with documentation and  book  pages,  etc.
from his own book.

Then I asked her--why would a cop tell such lies if  he  were  on
the up and up and had nothing to hide.

Anyway, I just feel strongly that  this  Brentwood-Lexington  (or
Kentucky) connection may be important here.  All the players seem
to  be drawn here--and to Anita Madden.  Bluegrass Conspiracy (by
Sally Denton;  ISBN:   0-380-71441-8)  was  about  the cops being
involved in extra-activities of  an  illegal  nature.   The  same
could be said of the LAPD.
