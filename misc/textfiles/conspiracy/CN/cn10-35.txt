      "But  there's  something  else  called  a *radiation*
      *missile*.  And the  radiation  missile actually goes
      to the radiation in the sky....  And when there is  a
      *hole*  in  the  radiation (caused by an airplane, or
      something  in  the  air),  it  goes  straight  to the
      biggest part of the plane.   And  it  *may*  detonate
      something  ahead  of impact.  Which would account for
      the two explosions  and  the  fact  that the gas tank
      blew up."       -- Pat Robertson, *700 Club*, 3/13/97
 
MURDERS AND COVER-UPS -- TWA FLIGHT 800
=======================================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
Nixon was removed just because  of  his COVER-UP of the Watergate
crimes.  On the other hand, Clinton, as President, is subject  to
impeachment  and  removal,  and  criminal  prosecution  as  well,
because  of  both  his complicity in and his cover-ups of various
crimes and murders, including treason and sedition.
 
ITEM:  The major  news  magazine  in  France,  Paris  Match, in a
documented story, contends Clinton covered up the missile  attack
that  caused the crash in July, 1996, of TWA Flight 800, offshore
of New York.  There is a lot, however, the magazine does not say.
Among the 230 dead were 60 French nationals, and of those, 8 were
members  of  the   French   CIA.    A   sinister  angle,  perhaps
conspiratorial, is that two top officials of  the  French  Secret
Police  refused  to  get  on  Flight  800 and took another plane.
American press fakers said  Pierre  Salinger's story was based on
anonymous claims on Internet, whereas, it was based on data  from
the French CIA.
   Some  while  after  the  crash,  the  U.S. authorities had not
announced they were going to try to get up the wreckage of Flight
800 from the ocean bottom.  So, French authorities announced they
were going to send 300 of  *their* technicians to scour the ocean
bottom as part of their probe of  the  crash.   It  was  at  that
point,  and  only at that point, that Clinton reluctantly ordered
U.S. efforts to start the  deep  water search for the wreckage --
to block investigation by the French. Why?
 
ITEM:  The FBI  and  the  National  Transportation  Safety  Board
covered  up apparent evidence showing a super-secret type missile
went through the plane, causing the  front part of the plane with
the cockpit section to break off, and  the  rest  of  the  plane,
minus the front, flew on for some 25 seconds.
   The  missile  targeted  the underside belly of the plane, with
the center fuel tanks --  it  was not a heat-seeking missile that
targets the exhaust of one of the engines only and is not certain
to definitely bring down the targeted plane.
 
ITEM:  Two events occurred prior to the March 13, 1997 release by
the French magazine and a press conference the same day by Pierre
Salinger, former Paris-stationed correspondent for ABC News  {1}.
(1)  Vice President Al Gore returned from a trip with a side-trip
to Paris, with highly  incriminating  data showing President Bill
Clinton had committed, and was still committing, various acts  of
treason  and sedition against the American people.  That included
but was not limited to, U.S. government prior knowledge and Iraqi
intelligence operative complicity  in  the  bombings of a federal
office building in Oklahoma  City,  and  the  missile  attack  on
Flight 800.
   For some time prior to the Flight 800 crash, Gore had secretly
joined  with  a  small  group  of  U.S. military vowing to arrest
Commander-in-Chief Clinton for the selfsame treason and sedition.
As stated in  exclusive  stories  by  me,  some top U.S. military
officers,  part  of  an  attempted  coup  against  Clinton,  were
murdered by way of a sabotaged plane crash in Alabama, April  17,
1995  -- was it just a coincidence that was two days prior to the
Oklahoma bombings involving  prior  U.S. government knowledge and
later, cover-up by Clinton?
   And (2), a supporter of Al Gore, and  his  secret  efforts  to
remove  Clinton,  was Pamela Harriman, U.S. Ambassador to France.
According to French authorities, she was murdered just as she was
preparing to go public  with  details supporting Gore in exposing
Clinton's various high crimes, including the Flight  800  missile
cover-up.   When  Gore in 1988 ran in the presidential primaries,
Pierre Salinger was  Gore's  press  consultant  and aide.  In the
past, Pamela Harriman was a huge supporter of Al Gore.
 
ITEM:   Although  Pierre  Salinger  and  the  French  publication
contend it was "friendly fire"  by  a  U.S.  Naval  vessel  in  a
super-secret  exercise  involving missiles that caused the crash,
some continue to believe it may  have been a foreign missile that
downed Flight 800.
 
ITEM:  To add  "muscle"  to  their  efforts  to  break  Clinton's
cover-up  of  the  missile  downing  of  Flight  800,  the French
authorities are considering whether to release their list of some
two  thousand  names  of  top  U.S.  mass  media  executives  and
correspondents who  are  actually  part  of  the  American secret
police, the CIA, complicit in the missile  cover-up.   Reportedly
the  list  includes  ABC's  Ted  Koppel and Washington Post's Bob
Woodward. {2}.
 
ITEM:   Spearheading  the French efforts to break the cover-up by
the Clinton administration has been  Pierre Salinger.  He is well
aware that the  CIA  subsidy  for  the  major  networks  to  have
overseas  offices was switched in 1988-1989, from CBS News to ABC
News.  ABC's  Ted  Koppel,  for  example,  often has CIA-financed
"consultants" or "think tank" officials on his Nightline  program
without identifying the CIA link to the foundations.
 
ITEM:  Knowledgeable sources contend that Al  Gore's  efforts  in
fingering Clinton make Gore a target for political assassination.
 
ITEM:  One reason for the  Clinton cover-up of the missile attack
on Flight 800 is that he did not want the mess to interfere  with
the  1996  presidential  election.   Insofar  as it was "friendly
fire" gone haywire by  the  U.S.  Navy,  Clinton  did not want to
further antagonize the U.S. military.  Chief of Naval Operations,
Admiral Jeremy Boorda, was assassinated prior to the election  in
the  on-going  efforts of some in the military to arrest Clinton.

{1} Pierre Salinger also  served  as  White House Press Secretary
during, I believe, the John F. Kennedy administration.
 
{2}  "...Reportedly  the  list  includes  ABC's  Ted  Koppel  and
Washington Post's Bob Woodward."  *And*,  added Mr. Skolnick in a
phone conversation this evening, March 13, 1997, "If Ted Turner's
name isn't on that list, it ought to be."
 
{3} Related item, from *700 Club* broadcast, March 13, 1997, 9 pm
CST (excerpts):
 
  LEE WEBB:  Pierre Salinger has released  a  lengthy  report
  which  documents  alleged  radio conversations the night of
  the disaster. A male voice reportedly exclaimed,
 
    "I've just hit that plane!"
 
  And another confessed,
 
    "We shot it down!"
 
  Paris Match  magazine  today  published  radar  images that
  purportedly  show  a  mystery  blip   racing   toward   the
  plane..... 
 
  PAT  ROBERTSON:   From  what I gather, talking with Michael
  Patrick,  our  news  director,   there  are  two  kinds  of
  missiles....   But  there's   something   else   called   a
  *radiation*  *missile*.  And the radiation missile actually
  goes to the radiation in  the  sky....  And when there is a
  *hole*  in  the  radiation  (caused  by  an  airplane,   or
  something in the air), it goes straight to the biggest part
  of  the  plane.   And  it *may* detonate something ahead of
  impact.  Which would account for the two explosions and the
  fact that the gas tank blew up.
