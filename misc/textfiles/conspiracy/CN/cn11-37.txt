JESSE JAMES WAS ONE OF HIS NAMES -- III
=======================================

The question arises:  If Jesse  James got $5 million from Emperor
Maximilian, then why did he bother to  rob  trains?   Supposedly,
the  answer  is  that  James  was  working  for  the  Confederate
underground, adding to their treasury.

The  question  lingers:   Who  is "HH?"  The anonymous author (CN
11.32) tells of the  mysterious  "88"  and  "88, Jr.," with those
numbers said to signify the eighth letter of the  alphabet,  "H."
The  anonymous author claims that a Felix Monroe Hughes raped and
impregnated an  illegitimate  daughter  of  Abraham Lincoln.  The
child therefrom was named "88."  Shedding possible light  on  the
mystery, one CN reader states:

  Felix Monroe Hughes... the father of 88.
  88 is HH is of course Howard Hughes...
  Howard Robard Hughes, Sr. 1869-1924
  Howard Robard Hughes, Jr. 1905-1976

In  his book (*Jesse James Was One Of His Names* by Del Schrader,
with Jesse James III.   Arcadia,  California:  Santa Anita Press,
1975.  Library  of  Congress  Catalog  Card  Number:   74-33962),
Schrader  claims that Jesse James took the $5 million (see above)
and parlayed it into  a  huge fortune, partly through investments
in the Texas oil boom.  Schrader adds that "with capital to burn,
Jesse was a backer of the Hughes Tool Company, which was  founded
by Howard Hughes' father."

But the anonymous author has indicated that, no, "HH" (88) is not
"Howard  Hughes."   So who is "88?"  Is it Herbert Hoover?  Is it
Hannibal Hamlin? The anonymous author won't say.

As noted in  the  previous  issue  (CN  11.36),  the  Confederate
government  went  underground  in  1865, and was headquartered in
Nashville until about  1884.   The  South's  spy network was very
good.  How did the Confederacy stave off defeat during  "The  War
of  Northern Aggression," four long years, 1861-1865?  The answer
in part, says  Schrader,  is  that  the  South  had  a better spy
network.  And that spy network did not just go away in 1865.

Feeling  in  the  South  still  simmered  and  boiled against the
"damnyankees" after  1865.   When  those  "damnyankees" increased
their war upon the indian nations  of  the  American  West,  many
southerners  strongly  sympathized  with  the  indians.  To Jesse
James,  "Sitting  Bull,  Chief  Joseph,  and  other  chiefs  were
Confederate allies..."   (Schrader)  The  underground Confederacy
began smuggling guns to the indians.  Furthermore, says Schrader,
military training was provided.  The  indians  "were  trained  to
fight  like  Morgan's Raiders and Quantrill's Missouri guerrillas
-- to split up  on  command,  hit  with force and devastation and
then fade away before the enemy could recover." (ibid.)

Jesse James eventually rose to the  position  of  "chief  of  the
Inner  Sanctum of The Knights of the Golden Circle."  He was "one
of the most  powerful  men  in  America.   The  Golden Circle had
industrial as well  as  military  spies  on  both  sides  of  the
Atlantic." (ibid.)

Unfortunately  for our tale, The Knights of the Golden Circle are
linked to the infamous Ku  Klux Klan, an organization responsible
for many hateful acts over the years.  Schrader does consistently
point out  that  James  himself  was  not  a  racist.   In  fact,
according  to  Schrader,  some  of  James'  gang  were themselves
blacks, including  chief  James  lieutenant  John  Trammell, "the
black cobra." 

Reportedly  belonging  to   a  lesser-ranked  Confederate  secret
society, The Knights of the  White  Camellias,  was  John  Wilkes
Booth.   Booth  worked  for  Confederate  Intelligence, smuggling
messages and contraband between  North  and  South.  In the final
year of the Civil War, Booth reported that "a  representative  of
the  European Rothschilds called on President Lincoln and offered
him money at 27.5  percent  interest,  but  was thrown out of his
office."  (qtd.  in  Schrader)  After  Booth  shot  Lincoln,  the
Knights of the Golden Circle began to suspect that Booth had been
recruited  into  the Rothschild organization.  Booth had not been
ordered by the South to kill  Lincoln,  so on whose orders had he
acted?  However, whatever the circumstances, Booth knew too  many
secrets  and  had  to  be  smuggled  to  safety.  The Confederate
underground eventually moved him to  the Free State of Van Zandt,
Texas. (Schrader)

But Booth slowly developed a  drinking  problem  and  his  tongue
began  to  wag.   Schrader  notes  that Booth, by about 1890, had
hired a lawyer "to write a book about his secret life and how and
why he  shot  President  Lincoln."   (This  book  may  have been,
*Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth* by Finis L. Bates.  See
CN 3.91) It was decided, according to Schrader, that Booth had to
be found and  silenced.   He  was  eventually  tracked  to  Enid,
Oklahoma.   One  of Booth's assassins, reportedly, was William S.
(Wild Bill) Lincoln, a distant cousin of Abraham Lincoln.

According to a sworn statement by "Wild Bill" Lincoln:

  Our branch of the  Lincoln  family was never satisfied with
  what really happened to Booth, and I spent  fourteen  years
  of  my life running down the true story.  Strangely enough,
  I learned it from Jesse  W.  James, head of the Confederate
  underground.  I was present at Booth's real  death.   (qtd.
  in Schrader)

Jesse  James and "Wild Bill" Lincoln allegedly crept into Booth's
room at the Grand  Avenue  Hotel  in Enid, Oklahoma, then tricked
the hungover Booth into drinking arsenic-laced  lemonade.   Booth
is  said  to  have  died  in  their  presence.  Although commonly
reported that Booth's corpse  was  mummified  by direction of his
lawyer, Finis Bates, Schrader claims it was the  massive  arsenic
in   Booth's   system  which  caused  the  mummification.   James
reportedly arranged for  Booth's  body  to  be exhibited on tour,
throughout the United States.   According  to  Schrader,  Booth's
mummified  remains  eventually  passed  into  the  ownership of a
Minnesota jeweler  named  Jay  Gould,  relative  of the notorious
banker. Today, the whereabouts of the Booth mummy are unknown.
