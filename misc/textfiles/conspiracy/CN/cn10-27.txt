              INDEPENDENT COUNSEL AND  JANET  RENO
               SUBPOENAED  ON "MOCK" TRIAL MATTER
              ====================================
                      By Sherman H. Skolnick
                      ----------------------
 
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr, U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno, and the  U.S.  District  Attorney  in  Chicago,  have  been
subpoenaed to produce records relating to charges the Independent
Counsel's  office  conducted  a  purported "mock" trial, with the
President and First Lady  as  purported defendants or prospective
defendants.
 
The three subpoenas were issued and served in a  Chicago  federal
suit  by  electronic  journalists charging Hillary Rodham Clinton
put them on an  "enemies  list"  and had various federal agencies
harass them, do  dirty  tricks  against  them,  such  as  telling
federal  judges  and other federal officials that the journalists
are "domestic terrorists," "enemies of the state," and such.
 
The  case  is  Sherman   H.  Skolnick  and  Joseph  Andreuccetti,
plaintiffs, versus Hillary Rodham Clinton,  et  al.,  defendants,
pending  since  July  18,  1996,  in  the  U.S. District Court in
Chicago, No. 96 C 4373.
 
The journalists contend in the  pending  case that the First Lady
is out to "get" them because they uncovered from confessions  and
interviews  that  there  was  a 62 million dollar bribery of five
federal judges  in  Chicago  hearing  cases  involving  a soybean
controversy.  This, the journalists contend in the court  record,
stemming  from  billions  of  dollars  of  illicit  Arkansas dope
trafficking,  implicating  the  First  Lady  and  her  circle, in
transactions disguised as soybean deals on the Chicago  Board  of
Trade.
 
Sitting  in  the  "enemies  list"  case  has been Chicago Federal
District Judge George M. Marovich, identified in the court record
as one of the five federal  judges mentioned in a confession by a
director of the Chicago Board of Trade  as  having  been  bribed.
Judge  Marovich  in  the "enemies list" case has not disqualified
himself, instead stating he  does  not  understand the matter, as
stated by him late in January 1997.   Shortly  thereafter,  Judge
Marovich  has  been gone from his court and court officials state
his  courtroom  is  being   "remodeled,"  although  there  is  no
indication of such. Has the judge "disappeared" for awhile?
 
A spokesman for the Independent Counsel's  office  in  Washington
contends  there  was  not a mock trial with members of the public
participating.  This leaves  open  the possibility the proceeding
is considered or  labeled  some  other  type  of  proceeding,  as
described  in  the  subpoenas.   Another  proceeding,  not  using
members of the "public," would be a so-called "Blue Ribbon" jury,
hand  selected  traditionally  by  the  FBI, of prominent figures
pledged not to discuss the matter, Skolnick contends.
 
Some knowledgeable  talk  show  commentators  have  stated that a
"mock" trial, based on federal grand jury data and witnesses,  in
advance  of  an actual indictment against the President and First
Lady, would be a criminal  offense; that is, violating grand jury
secrecy.
 
Skolnick contends the "mock" proceedings controversy is to  cover
up  a multi billion dollar scandal of illicit funds from CIA, and
dope  trafficking,  disguised  as  transactions  of  the Arkansas
teacher pension fund dealings, implicating and incriminating Bill
and Hillary Clinton.  The teachers pension  fund  money  laundry,
Skolnick  says, is interwoven with the CIA dope loot disguised as
billions of dollars  of  soybean  deals  on  the Chicago Board of
Trade covered up by the five bribed  federal  judges  in  Chicago
that  had  the  two  Board  of Trade cases [see CN 10.02].  Also,
Skolnick contends, to cover up,  by the Independent Counsel, that
the President has been plotting to remove Vice President Al  Gore
to  be  replaced  by  Jay  Rockefeller and wire taps used [see CN
10.26].
