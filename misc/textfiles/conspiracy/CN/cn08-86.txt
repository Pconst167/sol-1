THE PLOTS TO REMOVE CLINTON
===========================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
This  is a story about various plots to remove Clinton.  On April
17, 1995, two days before  the  bombings in Oklahoma, a planeload
of top military brass was sabotaged and crashed in Alabama,  near
a secret Delta Force base, killing all on board.
 
Under the  Military  Code,  they  were  planning  to arrest their
Commander-in-Chief, Clinton,  for  acts  of  treason.   They  had
onboard  a  live prisoner-of-war, supposed to not exist, to prove
the Pentagon and  several  Presidential  administrations had lied
about the P.O.W. issue in Southeast Asia.  They all were murdered
just prior to a planned press conference.
 
Those that know the facts contend somewhere historians will refer
to them as a planeload of heroes.  It was a real-life version  of
the movie, "Seven Days in May."
 
(A year later, former CIA Director William Colby disappeared in a
so-called  boat  accident,  and  later,  a  body  was  recovered,
supposedly  his,  and  was  buried.   Prior to his disappearance,
Colby had been doing a  series  of taped interviews for CBS's "60
Minutes"  program,  giving  block-buster  details   showing   the
Pentagon  and  White  House  for years have lied about the P.O.W.
issue.  And that P.O.W.s, although alive, could not return to the
U.S. because they knew  too  much  from  having been pressed into
service as  "mules"  in  the  dope  trade.   A  heavily-censored,
watered-down  version  of these taped interviews was aired by "60
Minutes" just before  Colby's  body  was supposedly "found" minus
the life jacket his friends said he always wore when going out on
his boat.)
 
(In a radio talk show with me, his close  friend  and  confidant,
John DeCamp, a lawyer from Lincoln, Nebraska, said Colby died not
from  a  so-called  "accident."   Further,  DeCamp confirmed that
Colby was  prepared  to  disclose  that  the  P.O.W. "mules" were
working for a dope smuggling operation  orchestrated  by  General
Colin  Powell,  his close crony, former Pentagon official Richard
Armitage, and George Bush.)
 
In a series of  reported  meetings,  from  about July 4, 1996, to
August 3, 1996, a delegation  of  top  Democrats  reportedly  met
Clinton, either in a room in the White House not the Oval Office,
or  in  the  nearby  Executive  Office  Building.   They told the
President that the much  expected  federal criminal indictment of
Hillary would burn down the Democrat Party.   To  back  up  their
claims,   they   showed  him  a  clandestine  photograph  of  the
indictment by the Independent Counsel, Kenneth Starr, expected to
be released either between the Democrat Convention in Chicago and
the  November  election,  or  right  after  the  election  --  an
indictment  charging  Hillary  with  perjury  and  obstruction of
justice.
 
The group demanded that Clinton either resign his office or state
that he is not running  for  re-election,  an  announcement  they
insisted he make two days before the Convention.  All, they said,
for the good of the country and the Democrat Party.
 
Clinton  would  not  give  his decision, but instead, cursing and
fuming,  called  the  delegation  "traitors,"  implying  by  that
sinister term that he would use his frightening emergency powers,
as president and commander-in-chief, to inflict reprisals on them
all.
 
Then, one of the group  reportedly  hurled at him the accusation,
"You are a heavy cocaine user, with  booze,  and  you  cannot  be
trusted  to  deal  with  worldwide emergencies."  They reportedly
said Al Gore would aid them  under the 25th Amendment, Section 4,
which provides for the Vice President to  lead  a  delegation  of
executive  department  officials to make a written declaration to
Congress that  the  President  cannot  carry  out  his powers and
duties; whereupon, the Vice President *immediately*  becomes  the
Acting President.
 
In  the various meetings with Clinton, the delegation included at
some of  the  confrontations  reportedly  Senator  Edward Kennedy
(Mass.),  Senator  John  Glenn  (Ohio),  Senator  Daniel  Patrick
Moynihan (N.Y.),  and  Congressman  Charlie  Rose  (N.C.),  among
others.  I wrote the first story about these clandestine meetings
which  some Democrats informed us that the delegation was chaired
or orchestrated by  Robert  Strauss,  the clout-heavy lawyer from
Dallas, former head of the  Democratic  National  Committee,  and
front  man for the oil industry.  The first version of this story
ran worldwide on Internet.
 
On August 9, 1996, Strauss  called  me three times stating he was
not there in person at such meetings.  He refused, in one of  the
conversations,  to  answer my question whether he participated by
intermediaries, by satellite, by picture-phone, by speaker-phone,
or other  high  tech  means.   Strauss  stated  he  is  head of a
700-person law firm that he will send after me and that  he  will
have  me  criminally  prosecuted.  When asked by me what criminal
laws, if any, provide for  the  jailing of a journalist writing a
story criticizing the White House, Strauss refused to  elaborate.
By  the  third conversation, he called me to tell me he was going
to have me arrested, implying that he has the political muscle to
mis-use the FBI and the Justice Department to falsely jail me.
 
On August 12, 1995, I  complained  to  the FBI, to no avail, that
Strauss was threatening me from another part of the country.  The
FBI and the Justice Department are not interested  in  complaints
from outspoken commentators.
 
After  one  of  the  clandestine  meetings, Clinton, hepped up on
cocaine, believing Al  Gore  was  part  of  the  effort to unseat
Clinton, by a coup attempt, reportedly told the  Vice  President,
"You are fired!"  Gore replied, "You can't do that," with Clinton
reportedly retorting, "Well, then I'll have you murdered!"
 
The  First  Lady,  apparently aware of plans to unseat Clinton in
favor of Gore, asked  a  Gore  relative, "Will the son-of-a-bitch
pardon me?"  -- implying Gore was taking over, she was  about  to
be  prosecuted  for various crimes, and wanted to know if Gore as
Acting President would grant her a presidential pardon.
 
Some of Gore's confidants have confided  to us that they expect a
Clinton-instigated assassination  attempt  on  Gore.   And  savvy
folks ask, "Hey, is Jay Rockefeller somewhere in this picture?"
