KINSEY, CRIMES & CONSEQUENCES:  The  Red Queen & The Grand Scheme
By Judith A. Reisman .  .  .  Reviewed by Kevin E. Abrams Alberta
& BC Reports, Canada, June 29, 1998

The 1960s sexual revolution was based on the most  elaborate  and
carefully crafted scientific fraud of this century, writes author
Judith  Reisman.  Early sexologist Alfred C. Kinsey, with his two
famous reports of just  50  years ago, seemingly legitimized both
profligacy and deviancy, and thus established "the sexual license
he [personally] espoused."  *Sexual Behaviour in the Human  Male*
(1948)  and  its  female  equivalent  (1953)  kicked off no-fault
divorce,  the  wife-swapping   era,   the  gay  rights  movement,
classroom  sex  education,  sex  "therapy"  as  growth  industry,
explicit imagery in the media and entertainment industry, and  an
avalanche of pornography and obscenity.

Although Kinsey, was a sexual revolutionary, Dr. Reisman contends
he  was  falsely portrayed by Indiana University where he worked,
and the Rockefeller Foundation which funded him, as just a normal
American  guy/husband/family  man  who  simply  'discovered' that
'really' most American men commonly engaged in sexually  aberrant
and  outlaw  behaviour.   Kinsey's 'research' alleged that 10% of
American males were  homosexual,  that  all  of us were bisexual,
that children were sexual from birth and could engage  in  sexual
activity with adults without harm, plus a whole broad spectrum of
things  taught today in our schools and practiced today in courts
of law as fact and as true...  It was fraud then, it is fraud now
and it revolutionized  this  nation  and  turned us into Kinsey's
[psychological] clones."

His "Grand Scheme" was to eliminate normal families in favour  of
selective  breeding  predicated  upon racial and sexual eugenics,
Dr.  Reisman  charges,  and  his  "scientific  conclusions"  were
concocted to advance it.  The  reference  is  to the Red Queen in
*Alice in Wonderland* who wanted the sentence (beheading) carried
out first and the verdict anounced afterwards.

Disturbing  information  about Kinsey's work and private life has
been accumulating  since  his  death  in  1956  at  age 62.  (The
official cause was pneumonia due to overwork, but  his  extensive
homosexual    and    sadmasochistic    activities   were   likely
contributors.)  Dr. Reisman  revealed  much  of  it  in 1990, for
example, in *Kinsey, Sex and Fraud*.  Even last years  resolutely
non-condemnatory  biography  by fellow Indiana University scholar
James  H.  Jones---*Alfred  C.  Kinsey:   A  Public/Private Life*
(Norton)---is replete with gruesomely shocking details.

*Kinsey:  Crime and Consequences* cannot  be  described  as  non-
condemnatory.  Its central figure, Dr. Reisman asserts, "fits the
classic definition of a sexual psychopath."  Had the public known
that  he  and  his  male  population  were sexually abnormal, the
popular use of  their  data  to  change  [our] law, education and
public policy would have come to a screeching  halt..."   But  he
blackmailed into silence associates who knew about "his extensive
use  of  deviants,  his  large  prison  population or, worse, his
active child molesters."

Still, she thinks, his  "findings"  should have roused suspicion.
"When I first read Kinsey's research, I thought this man  is  not
reporting  on  America  --  he's  reporting  on  himself and then
projecting that onto the nation.  Kinsey prostituted his own wife
Clara....into acts  of  sodomy  with  fellow 'researchers,' which
Kinsey filmed.  He seduced his own students at Indiana University
-- male, not female, students.  He devised sexual activities with
his  'co-workers,'  who   then   became   his   co-authors.    He
[personally]  engaged  in  violent sadistic activity, in which he
harmed himself terribly...and appears to have died, frankly, as a
result of the trauma to his body."

But his famed reports were  carefully phrased to obscure the fact
that words like  "contacts,"  "partners"  and  "sex  play"  could
signify  grown  men sodomizing children.  He was also both racist
and cautious  about  his  colleagues,  avoiding  Jews, blacks and
moral  traditionalists.   Dr.  Reisman  quotes  Kinsey  co-author
Wardell Pomeroy, (Kinsey and  The  Institute  for  Sex  Research,
Harper & Row 1972), on his hiring technique:  "As usual...we took
his  sexual  history  first...[Then]  Kinsey put down his pen and
said, 'I don't think you want  to  work  for us.' 'But I do,' the
researcher insisted.  'Well, Kinsey observed, 'you have just said
that premarital intercourse might lead to later  difficulties  in
marriage,  that extramarital relations would break up a marriage,
that homosexuality is abnormal,  and  intercourse with animals is
ludicrous.  Apparently you have all the answers.  Why do you want
to do research?'"

Biographer Jones  describes  Kinsey  as  "one  of  the  scholarly
eugenicists of pre-WW II" who favoured mass sterilization for the
lower  classes  and  selective breeding for the "better classes."
Moreover, Judith Reisman  emphasizes,  the Rockefeller Foundation
was early interested in population control and in using the media
to  popularize  it.   The  Reece  Committee,  investigating  U.S.
tax-exempt  foundations   in   1953-54,   concluded   that   this
"plutocratic  control"  was  accomplished by "funding the 'right'
university research by the  'right'  researchers, then by funding
mass media dissemination of  the  'right'  science  data  to  the
public..."   Kinsey's  numbers  made him a perfect fit for anyone
eager to alter what he would call human "breeding patterns."

Dr. Reisman, a specialist in  content analysis studies of written
and visual media, lost many family members in the Holocaust.   In
that context she raises further sinister questions about Kinsey's
data.   For  instance, who was the "lone pedophile," the "elderly
gentleman," cited by  Kinsey  for  his  sexual molestation of 800
children?  Who were "The Children of Table 34" and what became of
them?  How did  Kinsey's  "technically  trained"  observers  gain
access to the claimed 1,800 American children for illegal genital
experiments?   "To this day," she observes, "the Kinsey Institute
and Indiana University have  repeatedly...  refused to reveal any
names of the subjects or the experimenters..."  Nor has  any  one
of  these  children ever come forth, although the institute seems
an excellent target for lawsuits.

Even in the destitute 1930s, at the cited rate of a dollar a day,
she doubts that children as young as three months were obtainable
in such numbers  around  Bloomington,  Indiana.   She suggests an
ominous but credible alternative:  a collaborative  link  between
Kinsey   and  Nazi  Germany,  then  a  police  state  where  such
"experimentation" could have easily been conducted "as part of an
on-going collegial, cross-cultural, multinational, `fact-finding'
research project."   She  cites  significant  links,  such as one
George Sylvester Viereck who worked for  the  German  Embassy  in
Washington  D.C.  Viereck  established  Nazi front groups, and is
known to  have  been  a  Kinsey  correspondent.  Furthermore, the
Rockefeller  Foundation  was  simultaneously   funding   eugenics
projects in Berlin.

Kinsey  consistently  kept  secret  his  hypotheses and the basic
facts upon which  his  conclusions  rested,  Dr. Reisman charges.
"Neither Kinsey nor  any  of  his  team  can  rightly  be  termed
`scientists.'  Their  methodology  was not scientific, for it was
neither able to  be  replicated  nor  validated.   Their data was
anonymous, forced, secretly altered at will and fraudulent.  With
the aid of the elite academic  world  and  institutions  and  the
support  of  public  funds  and  the social planning foundations,
Kinsey and his associates,  who  served  as  his own private male
harem, conducted thousands of  sexual  interviews  to  present  a
false view of American sexual behaviours."

Amazingly, however, use of Kinsey data as authoritative has never
been  seriously challenged--until now.  It must not continue, Dr.
Reisman declares:   "There  [must]  be  a  full  and  open public
investigation into Kinsey's fraudulent data and its  impact  upon
lawmakers,  the  military,  the  church,  the press, the academic
world, the family and all our institutions."
