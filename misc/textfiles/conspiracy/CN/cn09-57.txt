          CONTRARY TO WHAT THE PENTAGON IS TELLING YOU...
      There is a deadly Gulf War biological disease ravaging
               our troops, and it is contagious!
 
APPROXIMATELY 15,000  GULF  WAR  VETERANS  ARE  ALREADY  DEAD AND
BETWEEN 100,000 AND 200,000 TROOPS ARE SICK, DISABLED, OR DYING!
 
*Be* *Aware*  that  this  disease  is  also  affecting  Gulf  War
veterans  in  the other Coalition forces who served alongside our
military, and their civilian populations as well!
 
According  to  Senate  Testimony  from  Ex-Senator  Donald Riegle
(Feb., Oct. 1994 -- Senate Reports 103-900, 103-983, 103-984):
 
  **  BIOLOGICAL weapons were manufactured, sold, and shipped
  to Iraq with the full knowledge of the Bush Administration,
  Dept. of Commerce, and Centers for Disease Control.
 
  ** These Gulf War  diseases  are CONTAGIOUS, and 75 percent
  of GW veterans report  the  disease  now  spread  to  their
  spouses and children.
 
This   disease   is  a  public  health  hazard  spread  by  blood
transfusion, sex,  and  perspiration.   Every  sitting senator in
1994 heard this information.  This  includes  ex-Senate  Majority
Leader  BOB  DOLE,  whose  wife, ELIZABETH DOLE, oversees over 50
percent of the blood donations  in  this country via the American
Red Cross.  Gulf War veterans have  asked  for  a  ban  on  blood
donations  due  to the transmission of the disease.  This has not
been done.
 
             ** OUR TROOPS ARE SICK AND DYING! **
 
Article III, Sec. 3 of  the U.S. Constitution defines TREASON as:
"...Giving [the enemies of the United States] Aid and Comfort."
 
                      SILENCE IS CONSENT
 
Whereas:
-- The entire Senate was  made  aware  of  this  information  and
remained silent.
--  Generals  Schwarzkopf  and  Powell had access to the Nuclear,
Biological, and Chemical (NBC)  logs  which  indicated the use of
chemical and biological weapons, and remained silent.
-- The Pentagon (including Assistant Secretary of Health Affairs,
Dr. Stephen Joseph), the Department of Justice, the  Centers  for
Disease Control, the U.S. Congress, and President William Clinton
have ALL been aware of the above facts AND HAVE REMAINED SILENT!
 
Therefore:
The  American  Gulf  War  Veterans  Association, on behalf of all
veterans from all  wars  and  on  behalf  of the American people,
demand:
1)  A  full  investigation  be  instituted  INDEPENDENT  of   any
government agency.
2)  A  complete disclosure of all parties involved in the design,
development, testing, manufacture, sale,  and use of all chemical
and biological agents.
3) The media, including  all  TV  and  radio  networks  and  news
agencies begin a massive education campaign to accurately address
the truth about the Gulf War illness, its contagiousness, and its
treatment.
4)  Companies  and  individuals  who profited IN ANY WAY from the
manufacture, distribution, sale,  or  deployment of these weapons
have their assets immediately seized until such time as treatment
costs and compensations are  determined  and  provided  to  those
affected.
5)  ALL  GULF  WAR  VETERANS  AND  THEIR FAMILIES THAT HAVE FILED
CLAIMS RECEIVE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT AND COMPENSATION.
6) If, DURING THIS TIME  OF  WAR  (we  are officially at war with
Saddam Hussein -- see P.L. 102-25), the  deliberate  and  willful
withholding of vital information leads to the injury and death of
America's  military  and  civilian  populations,  we contend that
those withholding that information have thereby "aided the enemy"
and should be charged with neglect, murder, and TREASON!
 
In this 50th  anniversary  of  the  Nuremberg  trials, let us not
forget those who were tried, convicted,  and  hung  because  they
"were  only following orders!"  These issues are real.  The facts
and official  records  speak  for  themselves.   Unless the WHOLE
TRUTH is told and those involved in  the  silent  murder  of  our
nation's  guardians are brought to justice BY THE COURT OF PUBLIC
OPINION, every American will be  at  risk.  It is truly a tragedy
when our Gulf War veterans must prove they have an illness, prove
that the Pentagon is lying,  and  prove  that  the  Pentagon  has
possessed this information since 1991 that would have resulted in
the diagnosis and treatment of this disease.
 
        THERE CAN BE A MILLION LIES BUT ONLY ONE TRUTH!
 
If  you  are  a  Gulf War veteran, send your name, address, unit,
location  where  you  were   stationed,   and  the  symptoms  you
experience.  We will send you  a  two-hour  video,  documentation
package,  and  the  song  dedicated  to Gulf War veterans by Dave
Riddell titled, "Where Are The  Voices That Care?"  (No charge --
you have already paid the price.)
 
If you know a Gulf War veteran  suffering  from  the  effects  of
chemical  and  biological  weapons,  or  if you just want to help
spread  the  word  about   this  terrible  disease  and  shameful
government  cover-up,  please  contact  the  American  Gulf   War
Veterans Association today.
