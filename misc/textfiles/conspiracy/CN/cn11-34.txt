LINCOLN'S "GREENBACKS" (AND WHY THAT KILLED HIM)
================================================

Writes  Dr.  R.E.  Search  in  *Lincoln:   Money  Martyred* (Omni
Publications, PO Box 900566, Palmdale, CA 93590),  "The  struggle
that  was  to rid the country of human slavery of the black race,
however, was also to fasten upon  the whole nation an economic or
money slavery, which has endured to the present time..."

Abraham Lincoln and  his  Treasury  Secretary,  Salmon  P.  Chase
(Chase  Bank  later named after him) went to the New York bankers
"and applied for loans to the  Government to carry on the [Civil]
war; the bankers replying, 'Well, war is  a  hazardous  business,
but  we  can let you have it [the loans] at from 24 percent to 36
percent.'" (Dr. R.E. Search)

Appleton Cyclopedia (1861), page  296,  states:  "The money kings
wanted 24 percent  to  36  percent  interest  for  loans  to  our
government to conduct the Civil War." (qtd. in Search's book)

President  Lincoln  and  Secretary  Chase  were  outraged  at the
usurious interest, and refused the offer.

Lincoln wrote to an old  friend,  Colonel Dick Taylor in Chicago,
and asked for advice.  His friend told him to  "get  Congress  to
pass  a  bill  authorizing  the  printing  of  full  legal tender
treasury notes or greenbacks." (qtd. in Search's book)

60 million dollars of  full  legal tender greenbacks were issued.
"All were taken at par and never appreciably fell  below  par  at
any time..." (Dr. R.E. Search)

Lincoln  referred  to  these greenbacks as "the greatest blessing
the people of this Republic  [have] ever had."  (qtd. in Search's
book)

But as soon as Lincoln began issuing the greenbacks, "the bankers
and money changers saw that unless they could stop that  sort  of
thing  they  were 'sunk' as far as ever being able to issue money
again themselves." (Dr. R.E. Search)

The banksters "had been  able  to  fool and hoodwink England, and
keep her in bondage for 168 years, and they wanted very  much  to
continue,  and to add the balance of the world to their conquest;
making the people everywhere  economic  serfs, working for them."
(ibid.)

>From the London Times:

  If this mischievous financial policy [greenbacks]... should
  become endurated down to a fixture,  then  that  government
  will  furnish  its own money without cost.  It will pay off
  its debts and be without debts.  It will have all the money
  necessary  to  carry  on  its  commerce.   It  will  become
  prosperous beyond precedent  in  the  history of the world.
  The brains and wealth of all countries  will  go  to  North
  America.   That  government  must  be  destroyed or it will
  destroy every monarchy  on  the  globe.   [qtd. in Search's
  book] 

The Bank of England/Rothschilds (do  not  be  deceived  by  name,
"Bank  of  England";  Bank  of  England  was/is a *private* bank)
issued, and  distributed  to  American  banksters,  the following
document, quoted in part below:

                       The Hazard Circular

  Slavery is likely to be abolished by  the  war  power,  and
  chattel slavery abolished.  This, I and my European friends
  are  in favor of, for slavery is but the *owning of labor*,
  and carries with it the *care of labor*, while the European
  plan, led on  by  England,  is  that  capital shall control
  labor by controlling wages.

  The great debt that capitalists will see to it is made  out
  of  the  [Civil]  war  must be used to control the value of
  money.  To accomplish  this,  the  Government bonds must be
  used as a banking basis.

  We are now waiting for the Secretary of the Treasury of the
  United States to make this recommendation.  It will not  do
  to  allow  greenbacks,  as they are called, to circulate as
  money any length of time, as we cannot control that, but we
  can control the  bonds  and  through  them the bank issues.
  [qtd. in Dr. Search's book]

SLAVERY  IS BUT THE OWNING OF LABOR, AND CARRIES WITH IT THE CARE
OF LABOR.  A "new,  improved  system"  of slavery was being born.
Gustavus Myers (a  "leftist")  corroborates  this  in  his  book,
*History  of  the  Great American Fortunes*:  "...chattel slavery
could not compete in  efficiency  with  white labor... more money
could be made from the white laborer, for whom no  responsibility
of  shelter, clothing, food and attendance had to be assumed than
from  the  Negro  slave,  whose  sickness,  disability  or  death
entailed direct financial loss."

"The  perfect  slave  thinks  he's  free."   That  was  the "new,
improved system" for exploiting  labor.   (Currently,  a  further
refinement is the use of temporary labor.)

Abraham  Lincoln  was  "the  man who first proved that government
could  issue  its  own   paper  money,  legally,  honorably,  and
rightfully, and make it full legal tender  for  all  debts,  both
public  and  private..."   Was  Lincoln "a dangerous man from the
[bankers]  point  of  view?   Could  they  have  continued  their
knavery, trickery, bribery,  and  destructive  work... if Lincoln
had lived?" (Dr. R.E. Search)
