DIANA MURDERED SAYS PURPORTED CIA DOCUMENT
==========================================

An  article  written  by  "Ru Mills" (pseudonym) and published in
Conspiracy Nation (CN  12.08)  gave  details  on  the arrest of a
"George Mearah" (apparently also known as  Oswald  LeWinter)  for
allegedly  trying  to  sell  top  secret CIA documents to Mohamed
Al-Fayed, father of Dodi Al-Fayed who died with Princess Diana in
a suspicious car crash on  August 31, 1997.  This development was
covered in several wire service and some newspaper reports.   For
example:

  "A man was arrested in a hotel lobby in Vienna as he  tried
  to sell documents to Mohamed Fayed  that  allegedly  proved
  that his  son  Dodi  and  Diana,  Princess  of  Wales, were
  murdered." (Electronic Telegraph, 4/30/98)

  "The  suspect,  a  67-year-old man whose name was withheld,
  had  been peddling documents which purported to be evidence
  of a supposed murder plot, by implication involving British
  and U.S. intelligence." (Reuters, 4/29/98)

A  further  update  on the situation was reportedly broken on May
14, 1998, in a  story  appearing  in the London Mirror newspaper.
The Mirror apparently included one of the purported secret papers
in its May 14th edition.  Here is an excerpt from the blockbuster
story:

  Mr.  [Mohamed]  Fayed  believes  the  Diana papers, said to
  originate from the US Central Intelligence Agency, back his
  conviction that  the  British  establishment masterminded a
  conspiracy against his son and  the  Princess....   Mr.  Al
  Fayed  said  yesterday,  "I  intend  to establish the truth
  behind the tragic  events  in  Paris  last August."...  MI6
  Director David Spedding is named in one telex and  a  squad
  from  the Israeli secret service Mossad, referred to as the
  "K-Team", appears in another.
                
  [The documents]  were  seized  in  an  Amsterdam hotel room
  three weeks ago when Mr. Al Fayed's security chief,  backed
  by  two  FBI  agents,  met a middleman who was demanding 10
  million (Pound Sterling)  for  them.   The intermediary, 67
  year old Oswald  LeWinter,  was  arrested  and  is  now  in
  solitary confinement in a Vienna police cell.
