THE BODY SNATCHERS
==================

Various organized crime syndicates  have  a  problem:  what to do
with all that money?  Some of it gets invested in private clinics
and hospitals.  Such  facilities,  "cloaked  by  shell  companies
layered  upon  shell  companies and administered by unimpeachably
correct nominee directors," help  conceal  and  are a conduit for
illegal  and/or  regulated  drugs.   (*The  Octopus*   by   Brian
Freemantle. ISBN: 1-85797-609-6)

Wealthy  patients,  some  terminally  ill,  come  to  the private
hospitals and clinics.  *They* have  a  problem:  what to do with
all that money, now that they face death or handicap.  If only  a
vital  organ could be found, they could get a transplant and live
on; if only new eyes could be found, they might see again.

In Third-World countries are an  abundance of vital and/or needed
organs, dwelling in the bodies of impoverished children and young
adults.  In hospitals for the mentally ill are  an  abundance  of
vital  and/or  needed  organs,  dwelling  in  the  bodies  of the
"mentally defective."

There is supply; there  is  demand.   In Latin America, *casas de
engorde* (fattening houses) spring up.  "These are shacks in  San
Salvador,  Honduras  and  Guatemala  to  which  bought  or stolen
children and babies are taken to  be  fed and cleaned of lice and
infection  to  make   them   more   attractive   to   prospective
purchasers."   (Freemantle)  Sometimes, children are bought while
still in the womb.

There is supply;  there  is  demand.   The  Neapolitan Mafia, the
Camorra, places Mexican, Thai, and  European  children  into  the
clinics  and  hospitals.   There,  they will have organs removed.
Problems of blood grouping  and tissue compatibility are resolved
by having potential donors warehoused at the facility.

There is supply; there is demand.  In the  lecture  hall  of  the
Faculty  of  Medicine  in Barranquilla, Colombia, ten corpses are
found.  They  had  been  "street  people."   "The  faculty warden
knocked out the beggars with baseball  bats.   The  victims  were
plunged into a coma and were not finally finished off until after
the extraction of their organs, the most profitable being sold on
the black market." (Freemantle)

You  can read of more such cases in Freemantle's book.  See also,
"Report  of   the   European   Parliamentary   Committee  on  the
Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection on prohibiting
trade in transplant  organs,"  2/25/93.   See  also,  "Transplant
Organs  --  a self-sufficiency in blood (A3-0074/93):  Resolution
on prohibiting trade in transplant organs," 10/4/93.

Some may say this shocking  information is just "urban folklore."
But, said Boutros Boutros Ghali, then-UN  Secretary  General,  on
11/21/94,

  International  crime  gangs  have expanded from traditional
  spheres of activity  such  as  prostitution, the arms trade
  and trafficking in drugs to money laundering, the trade  in
  nuclear  technology  and  human organs and the transport of
  illegal immigrants. (qtd. in Freemantle)

And,   says   French    transplant    surgeon,   Professor   Leon
Schwartzenberg (see his report in the already cited,  "Report  of
the  European  Parliamentary Committee"), regarding the worldwide
organ-by-theft-and-murder trade,

  This  trafficking  is  all  the  more  monstrous  where  it
  involves killing people to remove  organs which can be sold
  at a profit.  To deny the existence of such trafficking  is
  comparable  to  denying  the existence of the ovens and gas
  chambers during the last war. (qtd. in Freemantle)

Children and young  adults,  "brought  every  week to Europe from
Latin America and the Eastern bloc, to be kept alive until  their
organs   were   required.   Then  the  organs  were  taken.   And
afterwards -- or even  under  the  anaesthetic -- the donors were
killed" -- these have been "sacrificed upon the altar of the rich
and powerful." (Freemantle)
