SENATOR FOR SALE
================
 
I am  fortunate  where  I  live  to  have  a  public access radio
station, WEFT, offering me news and points of view  not  normally
heard  via  the corporate media monopoly.  Broadcast on WEFT this
August 17th was an  interview  of one Stanley Hilton(sp?), author
of an apparently current book on Bob Dole entitled  *Senator  For
Sale*. 
 
Unfortunately,  my tape recorder crapped out and though I thought
I had a recording of Mr.  Hilton's remarks which I could lean on,
I now find I must rely on brief notes and on my  memory  of  what
was said.
 
This  past  week  we  have  been  "treated"  to massive broadcast
coverage of the Republican Convention  in San Diego.  Even though
it was already in the bag that Dole would be the nominee and Jack
Kemp his running mate, nonetheless the whole  boring  affair  was
dragged  out night after night as the "suspense" grew:  Gosh, who
were the Publicans going to pick?
 
Who were these people that hogged every channel?  One source said
that one in eight of the delegates were millionaires.  Syndicated
columnist Mike Royko is supposed  to have stated in his newspaper
column that *one* *in* *four* were millionaires.  So we  had  GOP
Hogfest,  night  after night, with the whole boring bunch of them
-- Colin Powell, Nancy  Reagan, Son-of-Bush....  No wonder people
are depressed.
 
And the Thing was on  every  channel!   It  seemed  you  couldn't
escape  It!   It  was  as  if  It was required viewing, as if the
citizens were being *forced* to  watch!  What's next?  Will we be
forced to vote?
 
After  the  Publican  infomercial  had  been brow-beaten into the
minds of Mr. and Mrs.  Couch Potato, polls supposedly showed that
Dole had narrowed the gap between  himself  and  William  J.  But
wouldn't  you  think  people  would be angry at the Publicans for
making them miss their  sitcoms?   (This  editor didn't bother to
watch.  He read a book instead.)
 
Some of the dirt I gleaned from listening to Mr. Hilton  on  WEFT
is   that   "Beltway  Bob"  Dole  voted  *for*  the  World  Trade
Organization (WTO).  That  he  has  consistently  voted *for* tax
increases.  Hilton, who formerly worked  for  Beltway  Bob  in  a
high-level  capacity,  described  how  those  seeking legislation
gained access to the  Kansas  senator:  First requirement was how
much money they could hand over; then, if the bucks were  enough,
Senator  Dole,  according  to  Hilton, would help provide special
legislation for them.
 
Yes,  Beltway  Bob  has been saying how he's going to bust up the
State's mind control army,  a.k.a.   "the teacher's union" -- but
do you believe him?  William J. made big  promises  about  a  $32
billion economic stimulus package, meant to boost jobs, before he
suckered  people  into  voting for him.  Then, before he had even
been  inaugurated,  he  revised  it  to  a  $16  billion package.
Finally, to my recollection, he made a half-hearted attempt for a
$800,000  jobs  stimulus  package,  and  I'm  not  even  sure  he
delivered on even that!  Instead, Billy Boy just said (after he'd
grabbed the votes he needed), "Hey. 'conomy good."
 
So look at Bob Dole and ask yourself:  Do you trust his promises?
Would you buy a used car from him?
