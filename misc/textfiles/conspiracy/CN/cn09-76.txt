SHERMAN SKOLNICK'S RECORDED MESSAGE
===================================
(December 3, 1996; Transcription by Conspiracy Nation)
------------------------------------------------------
 
Hi!   Sherman  Skolnick,  Citizens'  Committee  to  Clean  Up the
Courts, 9800 South Oglesby.
 
So,  the  pressfakers  are  suddenly  talking  about   the   25th
Amendment.   They  say a group is studying how a President can be
removed because of psychiatric problems.
 
Remember our  exclusive  stories  about  the  25th Amendment:  it
provides for the Vice President  to  join  with  other  Executive
branch  officials  to make a written declaration to Congress that
the President is unable to  discharge  his duties.  And, the Vice
President immediately becomes the acting President.   Thereafter,
the   removed  President  can  get  his  office  back  only  upon
challenging the matter in Congress, in or out of session.
 
Since an early age, William  Jefferson Clinton has been with CIA,
acting at times at the behest of the London station chief.   Bill
traveled to Europe to spy on anti-Vietnam War activists.  He went
to Czechoslovakia and stayed at the home of a top Communist party
official  whose  son  was at Oxford with Bill.  That son knew too
much about Clinton and was murdered in Turkey by being thrown off
a roof.  Bill endeared  himself  to  CIA  by  going to Moscow and
returning with a secret transcript of a high-level meeting  there
attacking Stalinists.
 
Later to be his wife, Hillary Rodham had separate duties for CIA,
which  was sore at Nixon.  She was a staff assistant, with Bernie
Nussbaum, on the Nixon impeachment committee of Congress.
 
Bill Clinton can be  terminated  at  any time; the ultra-rich are
finished using him and want to throw him away.
 
Secret files of the DIA and the CIA show Bill Clinton suffers all
the years from split-personality syndrome.   Which  means,  under
pressure  he  thinks  and  believes he is someone else.  Hey!  Is
that  the  finger  on  the  nuclear  button,  huh!?   (And Bill's
continuing to snort cocaine just makes his mental mess worse.)
 
As we told you in exclusive stories, prominent  Democrats,  prior
to  the  election,  demanded,  that  for the good of the Democrat
party, that Bill resign his  office  and not run for re-election.
He called them traitors,  and  threatened  reprisals.   He  later
accused Vice President Al Gore also of plotting against him.
 
The  long-expected  release  of the indictments against the First
Lady and other past and present White House officials may cause a
more public  view  of  Clinton's  psychiatric  problems.   As the
secret files reveal, Bill cannot  take  the  pressure.   (And  of
course, he has long been a pathological liar.)
 
Please note the legal angle:  A lunatic cannot be a grand jury or
court  witness  against other criminals, such as those which have
surrounded him.  Likewise,  a  lunatic  cannot  be prosecuted but
must, instead, be sent  off  to  the  federal  brain  factory  in
Springfield,  Missouri  (actually a political prison camp.)  That
is, there to be pumped full  of super tranquilizers so he becomes
a vegetable and remembers nothing.
 
And what will cause Bill to go further bananas, huh?
 
ITEM:  He wanted White House Deputy Counsel  Foster  dead,  dead,
dead.  Because?  Foster, on behalf of Hillary, was tracing Bill's
illicit  dope  funds, parked overseas.  Hillary had long expected
to divorce Bill and she wanted to  find out where he kept the big
bundles of cash.
 
ITEM:  Bill Clinton shared bribery loot with  Commerce  Secretary
Ron  Brown,  who  died  in  a sabotaged plane crash.  And then, a
long-time  Commerce  Department   employee  was  apparently  also
murdered:  she was very savvy on the corruption in  international
trade deals.  She was about to appear before a federal grand jury
on  the  Lippo  Group mess and was going to finger the President.
Her body was found in  the Commerce Department building.  When is
Independent  Counsel  Kenneth  Starr  gonna  protect  grand  jury
witnesses who are being, one by one, murdered!?

Mr.  Skolnick,  since  1963,   has  been  founder/chairman  of  a
public-interest  group,  CITIZENS'  COMMITTEE  TO  CLEAN  UP  THE
COURTS, researching and disclosing certain instances of  judicial
corruption  and  political  murders.   Since  1971,  as editor of
updates of the  group's  work,  called  HOTLINE  NEWS, a 5-minute
recorded phone message, changed  several  times  per  week  --  a
regular phone call -- (312) 731-1100.  (Area code may soon change
to  773.)  Since 1991, a regular participant, now moderator, of a
popular, public access cable  TV program, called "Broadsides", in
Chicago and suburbs -- on most every Monday evening  in  Chicago,
on   Channel   21  cable,  9  p.m.,  available  to  some  400,000
households.  His comments appear on Internet on several websites;
archives of his stories can be  pulled up and printed out.  Also,
on Internet, his stories appear on some five categories  of  news
groups,  such  as  alt.conspiracy  and  alt.activism.   (See also

375-5741.  9800 So. Oglesby Avenue, Chicago, IL 60617-4870.  Call
before  sending  FAX.   NOTE  THAT THE NEW AREA CODE, 773, WAS TO
HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY NOW.   IF  312 AREA CODE FAILS, TRY AREA

A few highlights of the group's work:  Caused the biggest bribery
scandal in U.S. history, the collapse  of  the  Illinois  Supreme
Court,  1969.   Investigation  of  the  sabotaged Watergate plane
crash, 1972-73.  12 Watergate  figures perished including Mrs. E.
Howard Hunt, wife of the Watergate burglar.  One of the first  to
comment on the Vice President Spiro Agnew bribery mess, resulting
in  his downfall, 1973.  Investigation and disclosure causing the
jailing for bribery of the highest level sitting federal judge in
American history, Chicago Federal Appeals Judge Otto Kerner, Jr.,
1973.  Touching  off  "Operation  Greylord,"  in  which  20 local
judges and 40 lawyers jailed for bribery, 1983-1993.
