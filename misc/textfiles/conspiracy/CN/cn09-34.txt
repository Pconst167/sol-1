GLORIA IN EXCELSIS
==================
[CN transcript of remarks by west coast researcher Dave Emory.]
 
[...continued...]
 
We're talking  about  Gloria  Steinem,  her  association with the
Central Intelligence Agency, with Ms. magazine (of course),  with
people like Katherine Graham, with men like J. Stanley Pottinger.
We  just  took  a  look  at  Pottinger's possible role in an arms
smuggling  scam  and  his  definite   role  in  covering  up  the
assassinations of Orlando Letelier and Martin Luther King.
 
Now  we're  going   to   take   a   look   at   the   interesting
"extra-curricular  activities,"  I  guess  you  could say, of the
woman who was the *first* publisher of Ms. magazine.  Sometime in
the early '70s, a woman  by  the  name of Pat Carbine ("Carbine,"
sort  of  ironic  in  light  of   Pottinger's   role   in   these
assassinations) was, she became the publisher of Ms. Before that,
the  publisher  of  Ms.  magazine  was  a  woman  named Elizabeth
Forsling Harris(sp?).   And  it  appears  that Elizabeth Forsling
Harris played  a  primary  role  in  the  assassination  of  John
Kennedy. 
 
Reading  from Volume IV of one of the best series of books on the
Kennedy assassination...  It's  called,  *Forgive  My Grief*.  It
occurs in 4 volumes. It's authored by Penn Jones, Jr.
 
Now Penn is the editor of the Midlothian Mirror (Midlothian is  a
suburb  of Dallas), and he's one of the foremost researchers, and
a man  who  began  investigating  the  Kennedy assassination *on*
11/22/63 and stuck with it for a long time.  Far, far longer than
most.  And he published *Forgive My Grief*, Volume IV,  in  1974.
Copyright  1974,  privately  published  by  Penn  Jones,  Jr., in
softcover.
 
By the way,  the  title  comes  from  a  poem:  "In Memoriam," by
Alfred Lord Tennyson. It says,
 
     Forgive my grief for one removed,
     Thy creature whom I found so fair.
     I trust he lives in Thee,
     And there I find him worthier to be loved.
 
(A lot of people have wondered where that reference comes from.)
 
But anyway, far  more  important  than  that  reference,  is  the
association   of   Gloria  Steinem  and  Ms.'s  first  publisher,
Elizabeth  Forsling  Harris.   And   it  appears  that  Elizabeth
Forsling Harris was involved in  planning  the  assassination  of
John  Kennedy.   (Interesting, in light of Steinem's paramour, J.
Stanley  Pottinger,  and   his   connections   not  only  to  the
assassination of Martin Luther King,  but  also  his  association
with  people  like  Michael  Vernon  Townley, Frank Turpel, Edwin
Wilson -- and not to mention  George Bush -- in the assassination
of Orlando Letelier.)
 
Reading now from *Forgive My Grief*, Volume IV.
 
(And by the way, most of the articles in Penn's book are actually
editorials  or  investigative  columns   done   by  Penn  in  the
Midlothian Mirror. And this is one of them.)
 
                       Infiltrating Again
 
  The Women's Liberation  Movement,  as  well  as  the  Youth
  Movement,  must  constantly  be  aware  of  the  problem of
  infiltration by enemies.  In fact, the [Women's] Liberation
  group may very well have been taken over already by the Ms.
  publisher, Elizabeth  Forsling  Harris.   According  to the
  Dallas papers, Mrs. Harris  accompanied  Liberation  leader
  Gloria  Steinem  during  the Steinem appearances in Dallas.
 
  Since reading *Coup  d'Etat*  by  Edward Lipvak(sp?), it is
  easier to understand the enormous  planning,  and  checking
  and   double-checking,  necessary  before  the  killing  of
  President John Kennedy  could be successfully accomplished.
  Taking over the most powerful country in the world is not a
  small task.  Having constant surveillance  on  the  opinion
  makers  in  Dallas was only one of the necessary requisites
  in the planning stages.   Betty  Forsling Harris appears to
  have been one of the high-level observers moved  here  from
  Washington.     She   left   Dallas   shortly   after   the
  assassination. 
 
  Elizabeth Forsling came to  Dallas  a  few years before the
  assassination.  She was a great and good friend of  Stanley
  Marcus  of  Nieman-Marcus  [department store].  She married
  and divorced Leon Harris of  the A. Harris firm.  Elizabeth
  Forsling Harris  worked  for  the  Saul  Bloom  Advertising
  Agency  and  was referred to by Washington planners as "our
  Dallas  contact."   She  attended  the  important  planning
  sessions for the coming visit  of the President.  The Bloom
  Agency handled the public relations  for  the  visit,  then
  also  handled  public  relations  for  the Jack Ruby trial.
  This was a first for any  court, to have a public relations
  firm employed in a court case.
 
  Elizabeth Forsling Harris was a very close co-worker,  with
  Jack  Pewterbaugh(sp?),  on  the Dallas trip which cost the
  life  of  President  John  Kennedy.   Pewterbaugh  came  to
  Washington from Minnesota,  with  Orville Freeman(sp?).  In
  the Agriculture Department, Pewterbaugh was working closely
  with Billy Sol Estes, later convicted and sent  to  prison.
  It  was Pewterbaugh who made the decision to hold the lunch
  in the  Trade  Mart,  "because  of  the  proximity  to Love
  Field."  And it was Pewterbaugh who made  the  decision  to
  take  the  unauthorized  and  unnecessary  detour in Dealey
  Plaza.
 
  The two decisions make  Pewterbaugh  up  to his hips in the
  assassination.  Neither he, nor  Betty  Harris,  were  ever
  questioned by the Warren Commission.
 
And  again,  the  Bloom  Agency  handled  the  P.R.  not only for
President Kennedy's visit to Dallas,  but also handled the public
relations for Jack Ruby's trial.  This was  the  first  time  any
court  had  had  a  public  relations  firm  employed  in  such a
capacity.  (Although my understanding is that now that is sort of
standard operating procedure,  where  anyone  can  afford it.  So
this was sort of a ground-breaking event.)
 
One thing that is *not* included in that particular article about
the Bloom Agency (and recall that's with whom Elizabeth  Forsling
Harris was working) is that Oswald had visited the Bloom Agency a
number  of  times before his alleged (and obviously non-existent)
role in the assassination of Kennedy.
 
The important thing in examining Oswald, by the way (as we looked
at not only in "The Guns  of  November," but in a number of Radio
Free America shows  --  the  "Aryan  Nation"  series  and  "World
Anti-Communist"   series   in  particular  [CN:   Tapes  of  past
broadcasts may still be available; phone 415-346-1840, or contact
Conspiracy Nation for more info]),  but the important thing about
examining Oswald is to find out *who* manipulated him in  such  a
way  as  to  take  the  fall  for the Kennedy assassination.  Lee
Harvey Oswald didn't kill anyone.
 
The point here is that  Elizabeth Forsling Harris appears to have
been a primary planner in the  Kennedy  assassination.   She  was
never  questioned  by  the  Warren Commission, she worked for the
Bloom Agency, which had some  curious roles throughout the [Ruby]
trial.  And beyond that, she was  heavily  involved,  along  with
Jack  Pewterbaugh,  in  planning  the  motorcade  route  for John
Kennedy.  (That, of  necessity  --  for  those who've studied the
details of the assassination -- has to have placed her,  as  Penn
Jones  indicated,  in  the  very center of the conspiracy itself.
And as we've looked at  in  our  "Aryan Nation" series as well as
"The Guns of November," the Kennedy assassination  was,  for  all
intents and purposes, a military coup.)
 
Now   again,  perhaps  the  Steinem  association  with  Elizabeth
Forsling Harris in and of itself wouldn't be too damning.  But in
light of all the  other  information  -- the Independent Research
Service connections, in light of her association with J.  Stanley
Pottinger  and some of the things Pottinger's been involved in --
it's one more very interesting  detail concerning Steinem and her
involvement in a very deep intelligence mileau.
 
And again, Elizabeth Forsling Harris replaced (ironically enough)
by Pat Carbine, as publisher of Ms. magazine.
