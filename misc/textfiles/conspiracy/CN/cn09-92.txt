HALE-BOPP COMETH
================
 
Our Story Thus Far:
-------------------
   Back from a relaxing Christmas with the parental units and the
sibling rivals, reading through the  e-mail, I saw much fuss over
the approach of the comet  Hale-Bopp.   Two  amateur  astronomers
named  Hale  and  Bopp  discovered  that  a  planet-sized  comet,
appearing  to  have  a diameter of between 100 and 1000 miles, is
headed toward earth.   It  is  not  going  to  hit the earth.  It
should be visible around March 9th of 1997.
 
The Story Gets Strange
----------------------
   At this  point  the  story  gets  strange.   According  to  an
anonymous  source  quoted  in the latest issue of Rumor Mill News
(PO Box 1784, Aptos, CA  95001-1784  -- $5 per issue), "Reputable
astronomers have said that it appears to  have  a  spiral  shaped
structure  on its surface.  Others have said that the 'planet' or
comet is 'cube' shaped."  Some  are  going  so far as to say that
the "spiral shaped structure" is some sort of  alien  spacecraft.
I  don't  know  about  that,  but  what  *is* that "spiral shaped
structure?"  The speculation has grown, in part, due to its being
discussed on the Art Bell radio program.
 
Wright-Patterson Air Base, Bosnia, Roswell, and the Vatican
-----------------------------------------------------------
   More information  on  the  subject  is  offered  in the latest
RMNews.   The  anonymous  source  mentioned  above  connects  the
Hale-Bopp story with  Wright-Patterson  Air  Force  Base,  Ethnic
cleansing   in  Bosnia,  and  the  apparent  crash  of  an  alien
spacecraft  near  Roswell,  New  Mexico,  in  1947.   RMNews also
includes a letter, said to have  been  written  by  an  anonymous
priest  and  sent to Art Bell.  Commenting on the letter from the
"anonymous priest," RMNews writes,
 
  The intelligence arm  of  the  Vatican  is  by far the most
  sophisticated in the world.  It has been around far  longer
  than  all  of the intelligence agencies put together.  When
  the ancestors of MI-6  were  still painting themselves blue
  and running around naked, Vatican Intelligence was  already
  weaving its web upon the planet.
 
  The  world of covert intrigue, spies, assassins, espionage,
  propaganda  and  black  operations  were  invented  by  the
  Vatican, or at least honed,  by  them, to a fine edge.  The
  CIA,  NSA,  KGB,  MI-6  and  the  Mossad  may  have  higher
  visibility  than  Vatican  Intelligence,   but   the   most
  effective  intelligence operations are the ones that no one
  knows anything about.
 
Letter From a Priest
--------------------
Here is  the  "Letter  from  Priest,"  from  the  latest issue of
RMNews: 
 
  Date: 96-12-11
  Dear Mr. Bell,
 
  I have listened to your program off and on for  around  two
  years   now,  whenever  I  get  "downtime."   I  have  some
  disturbing information and I  feel  that your program would
  be the perfect vehicle with  which  to  distribute  what  I
  have. 
 
  I have been under the  employ  of the Vatican for over five
  years.  I  have  done  what  could  best  be  described  as
  counter-intelligence  work,  for the church.  I am a man of
  God  and  please  believe  me  when  I  tell  you  that the
  information I have is genuine, and very serious.
 
  Without  going  into  too   much  detail  about  my  former
  employers, I will briefly tell you that I have  had  a  Top
  Level  security  clearance  in  the  Vatican for quite some
  time.  Most of the work  I have done regrettably falls into
  the realm of "black ops," and I will  not  go  into  detail
  about that now.
 
  Around  six months ago, I was working at a data terminal in
  a highly restricted area following  a  case that I had just
  completed, when I stumbled onto something that nearly  made
  my heart stop.  Please pay attention here, this is where it
  gets strange.
 
  I   uncovered  a  heavily  encrypted  sub-system  that  was
  surprisingly  well  hidden.   I  found  that  it  was  only
  accessible through the  terminal  I  was  at, and one other
  terminal.  (I must point out that the area I was in was not
  an area that I  routinely  used.)   After  two  minutes  of
  trying  to  get  into the system, the whole lab shut itself
  down and I was  booted  off  the  terminal.  Not wanting to
  raise any eyebrows, I decided to leave and come back  later
  that night.  The strange thing was, when I came back, there
  were  *armed* guards standing sentry outside of the lab.  I
  must say that it is  not  unusual to see guards roaming the
  Vatican, but it is very unusual for them to stand sentry at
  a lab, much less while armed.
 
  Over the next month, I managed to slip  in  unnoticed  only
  once.   And after I had found what I came for, I understood
  the security.
 
  It took me a great deal  of  time to break into the system,
  and when I did, I wished I  hadn't.   When  I  entered  the
  system,  I  came  across  a file titled "WORMWOOD?".  (Yes,
  with a question mark.)  Thinking  it  to  be a test file, I
  brought up the file with the intent of copying so  I  could
  read  it  later.   What happened next was truly remarkable.
  The file sort of  "deteriorated"  into  a series of command
  lines that lasted approximately two minutes.  Once  it  was
  done running there it was.
 
  I  had  found  the  direct  link-up  to  the  Hubble  space
  telescope.   Not  only that, but it was pointed directly at
  the comet Hale-Bopp.  The program  was running some kind of
  analysis.  Taking directional  notes,  projecting  path  of
  travel,  etc.   After  realizing  what  I had discovered, I
  started searching and came across an e-mail data trail that
  led directly to the office  of  the Pope himself.  What was
  discussed, I cannot know.
 
  Over the next two weeks, I began to uncover  evidence  that
  the   Vatican  is  very  aware  of  the  existence  of  the
  companion, (a large body  that  appears to be following the
  comet Hale-Bopp), and is *very* worried about it.  I  began
  to  copy  files  and  pictures  that  were  present  at the
  terminal, when I found a  report from the United Nations to
  the Vatican, as well as a report from NASA regarding  their
  concerns.
 
  It  is  very  obvious  to  me  that a great many people and
  entities know of the companion  and are doing their best to
  keep quiet.  *Very* quiet.  As the next part  of  my  story
  illustrates.
 
  I  had  found another file that I wanted to look at, but it
  was independently encrypted.  At the time that I discovered
  it, I had  already  been  online  at  the terminal for some
  time, so I decided to copy the file encrypted,  and  decode
  it  at  my  leisure.   As  I  was  leaving  the  lab, I was
  approached by two of the Pope's  top aides and was asked to
  meet them later in the evening.  I didn't feel  comfortable
  about  the  situation,  so  I  agreed  and told them that I
  needed to shower,  and  would  join  them later.  I haven't
  been back to the Vatican since.
 
  I found out about a week later through some old friends and
  contacts that a contract had been placed on my  life.   Two
  days  later my mother and father were killed in a car crash
  in France.  Three days  after  that,  my brother and sister
  were killed when their single engine plane went down on the
  East coast of the U.S. I've been on the run for a very long
  time now, and am still trying to decode  the  file  that  I
  have  in my possession.  Approximately ten copies have been
  distributed to friends in  the  field  in  the event that I
  should disappear.  I do not fear for my life, as I am  very
  adept  at not being found, however I believe that the world
  needs to know of the  information  that I have.  I would be
  willing to share all that I have with you, Mr.  Bell.   But
  you need to understand that your life could be in danger if
  you  were  to  go public with what I give you.  I apologize
  for being so vague, but  I  feel it necessary at this point
  in time.
 
  If you would like the information, say so over the air when
  you get this letter.  If I am not listening,  someone  will
  get  the information to me, as there is no safe way for you
  to contact me at this point in time. I await your response.
