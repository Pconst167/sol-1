PROHIBITION LEADS TO "DOPE NATION"

necessarily agree nor disagree with portions of the following.)

Circa  1910-1918  --  Funded by tax-exempt "foundations," such as
the Russell Sage Foundation  and  the Rockefeller Foundation, the
Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and its offshoots  wage
war  on alcohol.  Contrary to what some now believe, the WCTU was
not so much a populist women's  movement as it was the hired army
of families such as the Astors, the  Vanderbilts,  the  Warburgs,
and the Rockefellers.
    One  offshoot  of  the  WCTU was run by Jane Addams.  She had
studied at the Fabian  Society's Toynbee Hall experiment.  Addams
launched a  similar  project  in  Chicago.   Her  social  workers
benefited  from  both  the recently-won women's right to vote and
the concentration of adult males on  the war effort (World War I)
to -- assisted by  agitation  from  WCTU  --  vote  up  the  18th
Amendment, allowing Prohibition.
 
June  6, 1920 -- Volstead Act implements the 18th Amendment.  The
Prohibition period arrives.
    "The 'Noble Experiment' was  aimed  at degrading the American
people through popular 'violation of  the  law'  and  association
with  the  crime  syndicate  controlled by the Our Crowd banks of
Wall Street."
   In New York,  field  agents  from  the Russell Sage Foundation
organize and recruit local hoodlum networks.  Specially  selected
persons,  mostly  from  the  Mazzini  "Mafia",  are sent to major
Midwest cities such as Chicago. One such recruit is Al Capone.
    Among  the  prominent  families  reaping  huge  profits  from
Prohibition are the Kennedys and the Bronfmans.
 
Late 1920s, 1930s -- Robert Maynard Hutchins, Knight Commander of
Her Majesty's  Venerable  Order  of  St.  John  of  Jerusalem, is
president of the University of Chicago from 1929 - 1950.   "Under
the  guise  of  'social  studies  research',  several  well-known
University   of   Chicago  postgraduate  students  receive  their
apprenticeships in the service of the Capone gang."
 
1930 -- Saul Alinsky enters the Capone mob.  For several years he
is their accountant.  Alinsky goes  on from there to, among other
things, help create dionysian cults among the American youth  and
the  ghetto dwellers.  "Alinsky, in fact, used the organizational
model of  the  Capone  mob  to  build  up  a  criminal youth gang
infrastructure in Chicago during the  early  1960s  that  assumed
street-level  control  over drug trafficking and related criminal
operations..."
    (As shown in  *Partners  in  Power*  by Roger Morris, Hillary
Rodham, future First Lady, became friends  with  Alinsky  in  the
1960s.)
 
Early   1930s   --  Prohibition  is  repealed.   Has  Prohibition
therefore been a failure?   No,  *it* *has* *been* *a* *success*.
Prohibition's true purpose was never  to  keep  the  public  from
drinking  alcoholic  beverages.   Its  *true* purpose was to help
foster organized crime  networks.   It  also  opened  the way for
corruption of politicians and  police  on  a  large  scale.   The
average citizen, during Prohibition,  was  put in routine contact
with criminals, resulting in  tolerance  for  them.   Prohibition
eroded respect for the law and for its agents.
 
1933 -- Nevada legalizes casinos.  The  Meyer  Lansky  and  other
syndicates expand their operations into legalized gambling.
 
1930s  & 1940s -- Organized crime also invests in sports stadiums
and  racetracks.   A  support   structure  is  established  which
facilitates later moves into drug trafficking.
 
Mid-1950s -- Start of large scale drug trafficking  by  organized
crime syndicates.
 
1969  --  President Nixon launches the "War on Drugs".  But Nixon
doesn't suspect how powerful of  an organization he is taking on.
His "War on Drugs" is a *real* one; it  is  directed  *at*  *the*
*top*,  at  banks  and  distribution  grids.  Nixon is eventually
forced out  of  office  by  British  agents,  such  as  Sir Henry
Kissinger, KCMG (Knight Commander of St. Michael and St. George),
and Edward Kennedy.

Many Americans are aware of  the  Mena,  Arkansas,  CIA-sponsored
trade  of  guns  for drugs.  Author John Cummings (*Compromised*,
co-authored by Terry Reed) has stated that there was another such
operation  being  run  out   of   Texas.   Sarah  McClendon,  the
long-time, gutsy Washington reporter, stated to this writer  that
"Mena  was  only one of a ring of bases, from Florida to Arizona,
that [President George] Bush  set  up  to  take *out* arms and to
import narcotics."  McClendon's statement is confirmed by  author
Roger  Morris  (*Partners  in  Power*):   The  Southern  Tier  or
Southern  Arc describes "'meticulously maintained' rural airports
in Arkansas, Mississippi,  Kentucky, Alabama, Louisiana, Florida,
and Arizona" used for CIA rogue operations  involving  a  "hugely
lucrative black market in arms."
 
According to the authors  of  *Dope,  Inc.*,  one way that greedy
dealers are punished by the Big Boys  of  the  illegal  narcotics
business  is  to  have  agencies of the federal government act as
"muscle"  or  "enforcers".   "Back  during  Prohibition,  old Sam
Bronfman had [a] problem with the petty racketeers who drove  the
trucks  across  the  border.  They were greedy, and too numerous.
Meyer Lansky's Murder,  Inc.  provided  the  essential service of
weeding their ranks.  It appears that today the same  service  is
performed for the dope traffic by the United States Treasury."
 
What can be done?  Forget trying  to get marijuana or other drugs
legalized.  WE DON'T OWN  THE  POLITICIANS,  THEY  DO.   We,  the
common people, can do two things.
 
Number  one is to tell somebody what is going on.  Sure, some say
they are willing and ready to pick  up a gun -- but are you ready
to pick up pamphlets and pass them out on a street corner?  Or is
that too scarey for you?
 
Number two is to  boycott  *their*  narcotics.   Not  necessarily
because  the drugs themselves are "wrong", but because if you buy
*their* drugs you are giving your money to a bad bunch of people.
 
The best way to shut down the "nation within the nation," a.k.a.,
"Dope Nation," is to not  spend  your money on *their* drugs.  If
you don't give the Dope Nation your money, if we boycott  *their*
product,  then  the  whole thing falls apart.  Get hep to how the
Dope Nation pushes  its  product  via  clever advertising jingles
disguised as "rebellious" rock music.  Notice how the Dope Nation
almost never hassles the consumers of  its  product,  but  rather
winks,  shakes  its  finger,  smiles and says "Naughty, naughty."
Dope Nation *does* bust *some*  dealers,  but mostly just if they
are competing with the Dope Nation monopoly on sales  or  getting
too  greedy  within  the Sales Department of Dope Nation.  If you
give  your  money  to  Dope  Nation,  it  winds  up  fueling gang
shoot-outs, including drive-bys where innocent people are injured
and killed.  If you give your money to Dope Nation, it helps  buy
weapons,  including  land mines, used in the Third World.  If you
give your money to Dope Nation, then  the next time you see on TV
a youngster missing a leg -- blown off by a land mine he  stepped
on  -- you can say to yourself, "There it is:  my drug dollars at
work."
