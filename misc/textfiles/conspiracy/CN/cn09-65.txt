The TWA 800 "Fumes" Theory
--------------------------
    The situation is, if it was a mechanical failure that brought
down  TWA Flight 800, then TWA gets the heat with lawsuits.  If a
missile brought down TWA 800, then either (a) the U.S. Navy takes
the fall for the  crash  or,  (b)  the  foreign terrorists with a
missile scenario means that U.S. foreign policy gets blamed.  The
foreign terrorists with a missile scenario also opens  up  public
indignation  and  calls  for retaliation.  What is needed is some
scenario where no one gets  blamed,  not  TWA, not the U.S. Navy,
not U.S. foreign policy.  Voila.  It was "fumes" that caused  the
crash.
    It is noteworthy that the "fumes" solution comes about a week
after the crash investigators had  the pressure turned up on them
by the Pierre Salinger allegations.  'Til then, the FBI and  NTSB
had  been  sort  of coasting along.  (Not to say that individuals
connected with FBI  and  NTSB  weren't individually, within their
personal microscopic areas of duty, honestly working on the case;
just that the lumbering bureaucracy itself had settled in  for  a
long  winter's  nap.)  Another angle on this is that pressure was
already building on high-level government officials (higher-level
than, for example, FBI's Kallstrom) to deliver up a scapegoat for
the crash.  Could U.S.  foreign  policy,  which  I suspect as the
true culprit in the crash, have maneuvered behind the  scenes  to
get  the U.S. Navy to take the blame?  This would explain perhaps
Kallstrom's lectern pounding pique:  Kallstrom, unaware of higher
level manuevers meant to foist blame on the U.S. Navy, would have
incidentally ended up  looking  bad  himself  --  if  a U.S. Navy
mistake wound up taking the  blame,  then  why  hadn't  Kallstrom
figured it out?  Why was it only thanks to "honest Salinger" that
the case was solved?  So Kallstrom, in this scenario aware that a
U.S.  Navy-did-it  solution  is  not possible, becomes enraged at
what he sees developing.
    Now,  thanks to the "fumes" theory, everyone is off the hook.
TWA can presumably emerge with its good reputation intact and not
likely  to  pay  huge  lawsuit  claims.   U.S.  foreign  policy's
reputation and possible escalation  of tensions with whoever shot
down TWA 800 is avoided.  "Fumes," like an act  of  God,  is  the
perfect fall guy.

Was FBI Drunk at Waco?
----------------------
    Not  yet  speculated  upon to my knowledge is the question of
how much beer drinking was going  on  during the FBI siege of the
Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.  Thanks to independent
investigators we know that many in BATF are heavy boozers.  Is it
to far fetched to wonder if, during those long nights around  the
campfire  by  their  RV campers, FBI personnel may have enjoyed a
few cold brews?  Or  maybe  something  a little stronger, to help
warm them up?  Did  the  press,  also  involved  in  this  little
camping   adventure,  join  with  the  FBI  agents  in  a  little
around-the-campfire good cheer?  Did  the  FBI  enjoy a few boozy
laughs as the tanks circled the Davidian  compound,  blaring  the
sounds of slaughtered rabbits and Nancy Sinatra late at night, to
the ears of terrified children within?

Bizarre Episcopal Sex Rituals
-----------------------------
    The  Washington Times National Weekly Edition (Nov. 17, 1996)
reports  on  an  article   in   the  current  Penthouse  magazine
(presumably available at Penthouse's web site)  about  a  "secret
cadre  of gay and bisexual cross-dressing Episcopal priests."  It
is alleged, among other things,  that a Rev. Howard Williams, who
coordinates  children's  ministries  for  the  Episcopal  Church,
tricked Wasticlinio Barros, 23, of Brazil into taking  employment
at  what  he  thought  was  a  job  as  a translator in New York.
According to Penthouse,  as  summarized  by the Washington Times,
"Mr. Barros realized upon arriving in Brooklyn that his true  job
was to serve as a 'sex slave' for [Rev. William] Andries, as well
as  to  provide sexual services for at least seven other priests.
When  he  tried  to  flee  the  country,  he  said,  Mr.  Andries
confiscated his passport and  returned  it  on condition that Mr.
Barros help recruit additional young men from Brazil."

Cars, Houses, Cost More
-----------------------
    According to an article in the Nov. 11, 1996  New  Federalist
newspaper,  the  purchasing  power  of  the  average American has
collapsed by 50 percent in the  past 30 years.  This ties in with
the phenomena, previously noted  by  Conspiracy  Nation,  of  the
"liberation"  of women -- "liberated" so they now must, from dire
necessity, trudge off to  work  each morning with their husbands.
This is not to say that equal treatment for women is not  a  good
thing,  but  rather  that their now being forced to work so their
families can maintain a decent  standard  of living has been sold
as a "great leap forward" in these "modern times."
    New Federalist offers statistics to back up  their  claim  of
declining purchasing power in our "good" economy:
 
    **  "In  1967,  it  required  35 weeks of an average worker's
weekly  paycheck  to  purchase  a  new  car  (including financing
costs); today, it requires 58 paychecks.  That is, today's worker
must work 23 weeks more, or 65.7 percent longer, to acquire a new
car.  Therefore, in physical terms, it costs 65.7 percent more to
buy the car."
 
    ** "In 1967, it required 399 weeks  of  an  average  worker's
weekly  paycheck  to  purchase  a  new  home (including financing
costs); today it requires 877  paychecks.  That is, a worker must
work 478 weeks, or 119.7 percent longer, to acquire a  new  home.
Therefore,  in physical terms, it costs 119.7 percent more to buy
the home."

"George" Gets it Right -- Almost
--------------------------------
    "George" magazine, in their December  1996 article on the TWA
Flight 800 crash ("When the Nation  is  Clueless"),  quotes  this
editor.  Most of their reportage of my comments to them during an
interview  for  the article is fairly accurate.  However one part
in which I am quoted  is  misleading:   "Asked why Flight 800 has
become a cause celebre while the ValuJet crash  has  not,  Redman
replied,  'The  number-one thing is that the FBI is investigating
this,'..."
    Here's how that portion of the interview really went down:
 
GEORGE:  Why has  Flight  800  become  a  cause celebre while the
ValuJet crash has not?
REDMAN:  Well, for starters, about a hundred witnesses swear they
saw a missile headed toward  TWA  800.   Also,  my  sources  were
unanimous  in  saying a missile was involved.  So it's reasonable
to suspect, since the missile  angle is being downplayed, a cover
up might be going on.
GEORGE:  But what about the FBI?  Why don't  people  trust  them?
Tell me something about the FBI's involvement in this.
REDMAN:   The FBI has a bad reputation.  For example with the JFK
investigation and also  with  the  death  of  Martin Luther King.
When news of King's death reached some FBI offices, wild cheering
broke out.  I'm not 100 percent confident in the FBI, so  I  tend
to not always believe what they have to say."
 
    The above is not an  exact transcription of the conversation,
but it gives the  gist  of  it.   Note  how,  due  to  "George's"
selective editing of that segment of our interview, it appears in
their  article as if I'm saying something like, "Since the FBI is
investigating, there must be a  cover-up."   That is *not* what I
said and the article in the Dec. 1996 "George" is  misleading  in
that part.
