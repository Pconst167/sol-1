HULK HOGAN: SERVANT OF THE "NEW WORLD ORDER"
============================================

The Ted Turner-connected station, TNT, has  been  working  public
relations  for  the  "New  World  Order"  via  its  Monday  night
"wrestling"  program.   (Turner, you may recall, recently pledged
$1 billion to the  United  Nations.)  "Wrestlers," including Hulk
Hogan, wear large "NWO" insignia on  their  costumes  while  fans
cheer  and  display  a special hand-sign, index finger and little
finger extended.  (Bill Clinton  has been photographed displaying
this same "secret" hand signal.)  The  crowd  goes  wild  as  the
strutting  macho  men,  fighting  in  the  service  of the "NWO,"
sometimes win  and  sometimes  lose  in  "contests" against their
opponents.

Having  Hulk  Hogan,  previously   a  well-known  prostitute  for
Reagan-era militarism, now performing his antics  under  the  New
World  Order  flag  is quite a coup for whatever public relations
schemers are  manipulating  him.   And  surrounding  Hogan on the
stage are a bevy  of  similar  musclebound  stooges,  all  loudly
roaring in favor of their cause.

And who dares to disagree, when the cause is  represented  by  so
many  giant  tough  guys?   You'd  better yell and cheer with the
crowd, or else these big goons  might  just put an armlock on you
-- at least the implied threat is there,  underneath  the  "great
fun"  of  it  all.  Sure, there are other musclebound stooges who
"fight"  against  the  NWO gang in their "wrestling" matches, but
who do you think will win in the long run, since the entire thing
is scripted?

The  crowd  of  mostly   young  people  watching  these  scripted
performances might not really give a  darn  about  the  "contest"
individually.   But  put  them  in  a crowd, and a peculiar crowd
psychology comes  into  play.   According  to French psychologist
Gustav LeBon, when the individual becomes  part  of  a  crowd  he
regresses  to a primitive mental state, is capable of acting like
a barbarian, and loses  his  critical  faculties.  The Nazis knew
this well, and organized their giant rallies to that effect.  But
the Nazis, unlike us, did not have television and Mr. Ted Turner.

If you think that the "New World  Order"  either  doesn't  really
exist  or is nothing to worry about, think again.  The plan for a
"New World Order" has been publicly acknowledged  many  times  in
the  mass  media.  In a nutshell, it goes like this:  (a) economy
goes global; (b) political  power coalesces around economic power
(according to no less an authority than Professor Noam Chomsky of
MIT); (c) put "a" and "b" together and you get "New World Order."
The New World Order plan =does= exist, and it is not going to  be
good for 99 percent of humanity -- not even for many of those who
now  support  it.   What is bad about the New World Order plan is
obvious from  the  fact  that  its  details,  like  with Bill and
Hillary's health care plan,  are  being  worked  out  in  secret.
There  is  no  "Bill  of  Rights"  included  in the NWO plan, and
because the  planned  global  government  will supersede national
governments, that means the  loss  of  legally-guaranteed  rights
such  as  freedom  of  speech and of the press, the right to bear
arms, and the right against unjust seizure of property.

And  who  is lending his celebrity to this horrid cause?  Why the
great "hero," Hulk Hogan!  Either Mr. Hogan is not very smart, or
else he is a  traitor  to  individual  rights  and to the working
people of the world.  The corporate-benefiting NWO plan will take
current national corporate  welfare  policies  and  magnify  them
tenfold.   It  will reduce us all to Nike slaves.  The transition
is already underway, with  reduction  of workers' earnings in the
"good" economy and a more and more prevalent police fetish.   The
handwriting  is on the wall, and now grossly obvious during TNT's
Monday night "wrestling."   What  =you=  can  do is dethrone Hulk
Hogan   from   his  place  of  honor  in  your  individual  mind:
re-classify  him  from  "All-American  hero"  to  either  dupe or
dud.  The TNT "wrestling" program is =not= something that's  "all
in  fun";  it  is  a carefully scripted performance, live theater
written by cunning psychologists who  --  believe me -- know what
they are doing.
