THE EL NINO RAT PLAGUE: THE GREAT DYING BEGINS
==============================================
Commentary by Ru Mills,  Editor, Rumor Mill News Agency
-------------------------------------------------------

    HAS THE PRESIDENT THREATENED TO START "THE GREAT DYING"?

This morning, as I  was  half  listening  to the President give a
speech, my ears perked up when he mentioned a "rat borne illness"
that caused 50% of its victims to die.

The President went on to say that El  Nino  had  picked  up  this
RAT-BORNE  illness,  and  was  spreading  it across America.  The
supposed reason for his  mentioning  this "rat borne illness" was
to point out the difference between spending money on real health
hazards as opposed to spending money on health hazards which  are
caused by smoking.

His unusual choice of an example made my conspiracy mind perk up.
In the September, 1996 issue of  Rumor  Mill News, we ran a story
which  was  leaked  to  us  by  one  of  our  high  ranking  Navy
Intelligence Sources.  The story he leaked was  about  a  project
called "Operation Rain Dance".

>From Rumor Mill News, September, 1996 issue:

  This project was set into motion by the Department  of  the
  U.S. Army, an Air Force  Special  Research  Unit,  and  Bio
  Medics   from  the  U.S.  Navy.   It  was  officially  born
  in/during the first quarter  of  1989, and held one purpose
  in common; how  to  eradicate  one  special race of people.
  (Through manipulation of genes, any race of people could be
  the target group.)

  The  project was called LVNM Special Labs Division.  It was
  located  at  an  insane  asylum  in  Las Vegas, New Mexico.
  (That's where the LVNM came from).  It also bore  the  code
  signal SB-17.

  SB-17  was  a virus they were working on to target and kill
  only native Americans.  Desert rats were used to carry  the
  virus  into  towns and municipalities.  There the virus was
  transmitted, via fecal matter, into the local water supply,
  and broken down bacteriologically, it was able to enter the
  food chain.

  Do  you  remember  the  7-9  Navajo  Indians  who  died  of
  mysterious circumstances.  The  coroner's report was "death
  induced by unknown virus".   The  experiment was a success.
  Only  America  Indians  died  of  the  virus  which  we now
  mistakenly call, the Hanta virus."

I  could  not  help  but remember this article on "Operation Rain
Dance" as the President pointed out that money needed to be spent
on discovering the cause of  the  rat  borne virus that was being
spread  by  El  Nino,  and  not  on  people  dying  from  smoking
cigarettes.

Could  the  President  be  sending certain people in power a very
powerful message?  Could  that  message  be....  "Don't mess with
me.  I now control Operation Rain Dance,  and  I  am  willing  to
target any group in America that I want to."

It  should  also  be  pointed  out  that  the  government already
possesses the antidote for  "the  rat  borne virus", but only the
Elite will be able to receive it.

If this speech was a message to the "enemies of  Bill",  then  we
must  now  realize  that  his  "friends"  are  in possession of a
weapon, far more deadly  than  any  gas or other chemical weapon.
With minor alterations, this virus could be used against any race
of people and it would cause death within 5 days.

According to the source who supplied this information the  E-Coli
bacteria  is  also  out  of  government  labs... specifically Ft.
Meade.  It also kills.  All  the  government  would have to do is
alter its strain, and many, many people could  die  of  it.   The
Source  went on to say that there are 65 of these "animals" ready
to set loose up mankind.

Will El Nino be blamed for the coming plagues that will eliminate
half the world's population?  Once when  I sat at a table of high
ranking Navy Intelligence types, they told me  the  story  about,
"The  Great  Dying".  They said that the old plagues like cholera
and malaria would soon  break  out  in  South America and Central
America and millions of dying people would be crawling northward,
desperately trying to escape the death that awaited them  in  the
muddy waters of their homelands.

The  men  who told me this tale said that the "official" story of
"The Great  Dying"  had  already  been  written  and  made into a
Fantasia type cartoon,  complete  with  a  classical  score  from
"Night on Bald Mountain" and other classical works.

I  was  told that the survivors of "The Great Dying" would be too
ignorant and unschooled to  read  books  or appreciate a newsreel
type program, so it was decided that a Disney type animated  film
would be the way to teach these people.  As the men who worked on
the project described the millions of men, women and children who
were  stretched  out  on  the muddy ground, crawling their way to
salvation in the United States, I could actually hear the strains
of "Night  on  Bald  Mountain"  playing  behind  the  images they
created in my mind.

Has the President threatened to  unleash  "The  Great  Dying"  on
America?   I  sincerely  hope that was not the message behind his
mention of the El Nino borne rat illness.  If it was, I pray that
there are people in positions  of  power in this country who will
take his threat to the world very seriously.

The President is worried about how he will go  down  in  history.
If  half the world's population is wiped out, and there is no one
to oppose him, all he  has  to  do  is move to Hollywood and take
over a Disney-type studio.  Then he can write his own version  of
history, one in which a cartoon hero-version of President William
Jefferson  Clinton  becomes  a combination of all the politically
correct heros in  the  world.   "Super  Clinton"  will become the
stuff Arthurian legends are made of.
