IN RUSSIA: BIG FUSS OVER "THE TSAR'S" BONES
===========================================

Associated Press (AP) reports  (7/15/98) on current ceremonies in
Russia involving the formal burial of supposed  remains  of  Tsar
Nicholas II and members of the Russian royal family.  But several
hundred demonstrators in St. Petersburg marched in protest:  "The
marchers   don't  believe  the  bones  are  those  of  the  royal
family..." [1]

"The Russian Orthodox Church has  refused  to  accept  [DNA  test
results  which]  scientists  believe  has conclusively proven the
authenticity of the remains." [2]

Some other  experts  are  claiming  that  "the  discovery  of the
[supposedly royal] remains in 1991 was a KGB-inspired fraud." [3]

The controversy raging in  Russia  over  whether or not the bones
are those of certain Romanovs, supposedly murdered by  Bolsheviks
at  Ekaterinburg  in  1918,  has  caused  Russian president Boris
Yeltsin  to  abruptly  cancel  his  plans  to  attend  the burial
ceremony.

Remains of two of the Romanov children, Alexei  and  Maria,  have
never officially been found. 

Yet  strong  evidence throughout the years consistently points to
at least two of  the  Romanov  children, Alexei and Anastasia, as
having survived the supposed 1918  "mass  execution"  and  having
lived  for  decades thereafter.  (See, for example, the book "The
File on the  Tsar"  by  Anthony  Summers  and Tom Mangold.  ISBN:
0-06-012807-0.)

So why is this important?  Because (1) there =is= such a thing as
"the truth," and (2) because the truth matters.   We  know  that,
contrary  to  pronouncements by academic eggheads, that the truth
is not always "subjective."   For  example,  2  +  2 = 4; there's
nothing  "subjective"  about  it.   See  also  the  little  book,
"Meditations," by Rene Descartes to convince yourself that,  yes,
there  is  such a thing as "the truth."  As to whether or not the
truth matters, that is  harder  to  prove.  But consider that for
centuries the pursuit of truth has been regarded  as  =the=  most
important  occupation.  "There is no religion higher than truth."
Or, as  inscribed  on  the  door  of  the  Bishop  Payne Library,
Virginia Theological Seminary:

  Seek the truth
  Come whence it may
  Cost what it will.

So   Conspiracy   Nation   (CN)  keeps  plugging  away,  offering
counterpoint to  a  universe  of  lies  constantly  propagated by
supposed "intellectuals."  CN is just  silly  enough  to  believe
that  the truth might actually matter.  And the truth is that not
all of the Romanovs, and even none of the Romanovs, were murdered
in 1918 at Ekaterinburg.

The motive for this massive,  ongoing cover-up of the actual fate
of the Romanovs seems to be based on greed.  Tsar  "Nicholas  was
in  theory  the  richest  man in the world with eight magnificent
palaces, a  staff  of  15,000  and  crown  property  estimated at
between eight and ten billion pounds."   [4]  Surviving  Romanovs
would  have laid claim to that property, much of it consisting of
billions of dollars worth of gold  and precious gems.  But if the
false claim that  the  Tsar  and  his  family  had  all  died  at
Ekaterinburg came to be accepted, then "someone else" could claim
the  vast treasure.  Likely suspects for the "someone else" would
be the British royals,  the  German royals, and the Rockefellers.
Maybe they "divied up  the  loot"  between  themselves.   We  are
talking  here  about  perhaps  the  greatest robbery ever to have
occurred in the history of the world.

See CN 4.26 for a reproduction of a  United  Press  International
(UPI)  story  carried  initially  in  --  then pulled from -- the
Chicago Tribune, 12/14/70:  "U.S.  Aided Rescue Of Czar Nicholas,
British Hint."  It appears that a "Sir William Wiseman, a partner
in the New York banking house  of  Kuhn,  Loeb  &  Co."  received
$75,000  from  the  U.S.  government  as part of a "scheme" for a
secret mission to rescue the Tsar and his family.  "There is also
mounting evidence  that  the  unpublished  complete  text  of the
treaty of Brest-Litovsk... contained a guarantee from  the  Lenin
government that no harm would come to the Romanovs..." [5]

Commander of "White Russian"  forces, Prince Kuli-Mirza, believed
that the Romanovs survived Ekaterinburg, and showed Gleb  Botkin,
son  of  the  Tsar's doctor, several secret reports "according to
which the imperial family had first  been taken to a monastery in
the province of Perm, and later sent to Denmark." [6]

According to the official story,  23 people were supposed to have
all crammed together into the cellar  of  the  Ipatiev  House  at
Ekaterinburg  for  the  "mass execution" -- 23 people -- shooters
and shot -- in a room measuring 17 feet by 14 feet.  [7]

A  Captain  Malinovsky  of  the  Officer's Commission, one of the
first  investigators  on  the   scene  subsequent  to  the  "mass
execution," wrote this, in an official dossier:  "As a result  of
my  work on this case I became convinced that the imperial family
was =alive=.  It  appeared  to  me  that  the Bolsheviks had shot
someone in the room in order to  =simulate=  the  murder  of  the
imperial family..." [8]

There's  a lot more.  These (above) have been just a few examples
of why so many  do  not  believe  supposed  DNA evidence that the
remains of the Tsar and members of his  family  have  truly  been
found.   "Science"  is  only  as  good as the scientist, and even
scientists can be hoodwinked  --  for  example, by faked data and
evidence.
