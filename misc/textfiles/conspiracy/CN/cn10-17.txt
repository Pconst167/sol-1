O.J. SIMPSON AND THE CIVIL VERDICT
==================================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
O.J. Simpson lost the civil  trial  -- the reasons are simple but
heavy.  He could not tell the truth for fear  his  entire  family
would be wiped out.
 
ITEM:   OJ  has  to shut his mouth about the mobsters controlling
super-stars like him and their crooked arrangements with the mass
media.   OJ's  gangster  business  partner,  also  in  dope,  was
murdered during  the  criminal  trial.   Only  the  newspapers in
Buffalo, New York -- where OJ is from -- talked about it.
 
ITEM:  OJ's business confidants confirmed to us that he told them
months before the double murders that his ex-wife Nicole and  her
crony  Ron  were  big in dope dealing.  OJ said it endangered the
rest of his family and his  businesses,  AND HE HAD TO STOP THEM.
But HOW?
 
ITEM:  Ron Goldman was part of  a  homosexual  gang  distributing
dope,  on  credit, to celebrities and fancy people, through fancy
restaurants like where he  worked.   His sidekick, also a waiter,
Michael Nigg,  was  murdered  three  weeks  before  the  criminal
verdict in October, 1995.
   AND:   The  courtroom  bailiff  during  that  first  trial was
likewise murdered.  HE KNEW  TOO  MUCH.  Each evening the bailiff
had custody of the juror's notebooks.  AND:   During  that  first
trial,  a nosey mass media reporter was knocked off (Robin Clark,
covering the first trial for the Philadelphia Inquirer.)
 
ITEM:   The  Drug  Enforcement  police  had  an  undercover  team
tracking Ron Goldman.  They  also  witnessed reportedly the blood
bath, the double murders -- their "see in the dark" video (called
extreme low lux video) shows three or four hispanics or orientals
did the double butcher job.
   Also, because of jealousy, OJ had private detectives  tracking
Nicole  --  they  reportedly also witnessed the bloody horror and
informed OJ who came on  the  scene AFTER THE MURDERS.  Hence his
shoe print there as well as some of the blood on him.
   A witness prepared to testify about this was clapped  away  by
crooked judges.
   The  highly corrupt narcs and the private dicks did not lift a
finger to stop  the  bloodshed  they  were reportedly witnessing.
They knew better than to mix in.
 
ITEM:  The OJ affair revolves around the bloody turf war --  such
as  in  California  --  between  two  major  dope operations, the
Herreras of Mexico  and  the  Japanese  mafia,  the Yakuza.  Both
gangs are tight with the American CIA raising money for espionage
operations through flooding the U.S. with dope.
   From the bitter divorce, Nicole got most  of  OJ's  fast  food
stores  and  brought  in crooked police brass as silent partners.
These stores reportedly  laundered  dope  loot through California
banks, most of them owned by  the  Yakuza  --  such  as  Bank  of
America,  Wells  Fargo,  and  Household  International  and their
units, Household Bank.
   In the first trial,  Criminal  Court  Judge Lance Ito knew all
about this.  His wife, Margaret York, is an L.A.  Police  Captain
in  charge  of  investigating police corruption.  AND:  Judge Ito
reportedly has Heidi Fleiss's  secret  records that could be used
to blackmail top officials, celebrities, and such.  She  was  the
convicted  head of the call girl rackets tied to some of Nicole's
friends.
 
ITEM:  Some of the L.A.  detectives  in  the OJ case are the same
ones who covered up the political assassination in 1968 of Robert
Kennedy, brother of the slain President John F. Kennedy.
 
ITEM:  Some of OJ's lawyers are reportedly tight with known major
dopers.
 
ITEM:  Was it a mere coincidence that a  so-called  "disgruntled"
person  slaughtered  employees in the L.A. Police laboratory?  In
the first  trial,  did  one  of  the  jurors  get herself removed
because she had a relative in  that  police  laboratory  and  was
fearful?
 
THE  BOTTOM  LINE:   President Clinton knows plenty about the CIA
and this dope traffic, going  back  to  the time he was Governor.
Unwinding the truth in the O.J. Simpson matter would put in  jail
the  President, top narcs, judges, prosecutors, police brass, and
radio, TV, and print media  bigshots,  along with bankers such as
Wells Fargo, tight with Clinton.
   (Major owners of Wells Fargo, which in turn is a  major  owner
of  Household  International,  include  the  Yakuza  and business
blowhard Warren Buffet.  And Buffet  is  a major owner of Disney,
that owns ABC News, and he is a major  owner  of  the  Washington
Post, Coca-Cola Company, and major Wall Street bond houses.)
 
IF  O.J.  SIMPSON TOLD THE TRUTH, NO DOUBT HIS WHOLE FAMILY WOULD
BE WIPED OUT, including children  from  his two ex-wives.  If you
were in his position could *you* tell the world the  truth  about
all this?
