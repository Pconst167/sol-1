PRINCESSES IN PERIL
===================
1) Princess Grace of Monaco
2) American "Princess" Marilyn Monroe
3) Princess Diana of Wales

On Geraldo Rivera's WGN television  program of 9/30/97, the topic
of discussion was conspiracy theories relating to the  deaths  of
Princess  Grace  of Monaco, Marilyn Monroe, and Princess Diana of
Wales. This is Conspiracy Nation's summary of the program.

=1=
Marilyn Monroe
--------------
   On May 29, 1962,  at  a  45th  birthday celebration for JFK at
Madison  Square  Garden,  New  York,  Kennedy-clan intimate Peter
Lawford introduces movie star Marilyn Monroe as "the late Marilyn
Monroe."   On  August 5, 1962, Monroe is found dead.  Officially,
it is called a "suicide."   But  Geraldo Rivera plainly states on
his program of 9/30/97 that Robert F.  Kennedy  *knew*  that  the
Mafia   had   "bugged"  Monroe's  home  and  possessed  tapes  of
encounters  between  Bobby  and  Jack  Kennedy  and  Ms.  Monroe.
Geraldo  adds  that  documents  are  surfacing  that indicate the
relationship between the  Kennedy  brothers  and Monroe was "very
deep and personal."
   But, says a guest  from  the  Guardian newspaper, we imagine a
conspiracy in such cases because of our inability to accept  that
Monroe, Diana, and Grace were snatched from us before their time.
The Guardian reporter says we concoct these elaborate theories to
help us deal with their deaths.
   This explains, for example, why Sam and Chuck Giancana, godson
and  brother,  respectively,  of  deceased Chicago Mafia boss Sam
"Momo" Giancana, would write 

  The killers waited for the  cover of darkness and, sometime
  before midnight, entered Marilyn's  [Monroe's]  home.   She
  struggled   at   first,   it   was   said...   [but]  their
  rubber-gloved hands easily forced her nude body to the bed.
  Calmly... they taped her mouth shut and proceeded to insert
  a specially "doctored" Nembutal  suppository into her anus.
  (*Double-Cross*  by  Sam   and   Chuck   Giancana.    ISBN:
  0-446-36412-6)

You  see,  Sam Giancana and his Mafia buddies were really a bunch
of sensitive guys.  They  had  trouble  facing how Marilyn Monroe
was snatched away so suddenly from life.  To help them deal  with
their tender emotions, they "concocted" this conspiracy story and
even put it in a book that became a New York Times bestseller.

Princess Grace (a.k.a. Grace Kelly)
-----------------------------------
   Princess Grace was supposedly driving the  car  when  she  and
daughter,  Princess  Stefanie,  careened  of  a  cliff.  Stefanie
survived.   What  happened  is  still  a  mystery,  says Geraldo.
Currently, Stefanie *will not talk* about the accident.  The tame
theory is that Stefanie, not old enough to drive, was the  actual
driver.   The  cover-up  in  this  scenario  is  that, to protect
Stefanie, official reports had Grace as the driver.  Other angles
are more sinister, but unfortunately  this editor can't recall at
the moment *where* in his vast  archives  info  on  these  darker
theories is stored.

Princess Diana of Wales
-----------------------
   Now  comes  the  good  stuff.   Much  new info came out during
Geraldo's broadcast  of  9/30/97.   Here,  arranged by individual
guests, are some of what was said.

   Geraldo alerts us  that,  in  the  death  of  Princess  Diana,
"Conspiracy  theories, suggesting murder, have begun to surface."
According to the mellow talk  show  host, Kitty Kelly says in her
recent book that,  for  a  time,  Princess  Diana  suspected  the
involvement  of the British secret service in the death of one of
her favorite bodyguards.  He died in a motorcycle crash.  Geraldo
offers his own (surprisingly good) "conspiracy theory":  Mohammed
Al-Fayed, father  of  Dodi  Fayed,  was  cruelly  treated  by his
adopted country, Great Britain.  He got the idea, "Here  is  this
woman  (Diana)  that's available."  He used his handsome son in a
"conspiracy of seduction."  Dodi,  a playboy with sensibility and
passion, fell in love with Diana.  Mohammed Al-Fayed exulted,  "I
have  achieved  my  conspiracy.   I  will  show the British royal
family.   I  will  control  the  mother  of  the  future  king of
England."  (Not bad, for Geraldo.  He may have hidden  talent  in
the conspiracy field.)

The President of the American-Arab-Muslim Council calls Geraldo's
theory  "a  very  good  and  valid theory.  Mohammed Al-Fayed had
acquired 'jewels'  --  national  institutions:   the  Ritz Hotel,
Harrods.  And now he wants  to  add  to  his  collection  another
'jewel,'  the  princess."   The  Council President says there are
*two* conspiracies:  (1) keeping focus  off  Dodi Fayed "as if he
is a phantom."  He says this is because of prejudice against Dodi
Fayed because he's Arab and Muslim.  (2) As  to  whether  it  was
murder,  the  Council  President is cautious:  "I think there are
many questions unanswered."  AND,  in a startling allegation, the
Council  President  says  that  Dodi  and  Diana  WERE   MARRIED,
SECRETLY, IN EGYPT.  That is why they were looking for a house in
Paris.

Jeff  Steinberg  of  Executive Intelligence Review magazine (EIR)
points out that  Princess  Diana,  in  November  of  1995, gave a
lengthy interview to BBC Panorama in which she, in  effect,  said
her  estranged husband, Prince Charles, was unqualified to be the
king, and that it was preferable  for her son, Prince William, in
some form of regency, to take the job instead.  Diana, says  EIR,
never  abandoned  this  controversial political stand.  On August
27th, 1997, Diana gave  a  lengthy  interview to French newspaper
*LeMonde* in which, in even more strident  terms,  she  said,  "I
want to play a role in the education of my sons."  EIR does *not*
say,  necessarily,  that  the  House  of  Windsor ordered Diana's
death.   But  adds,  "I  think  it's  important  to  realize that
Princess Diana was *not* an air-head."
   EIR goes on to blame,  in  the  person  of  Steinberg  on  the
Geraldo  show, mass media coverage here in the USA as inadequate.
"We've (EIR) been receiving  daily  news coverage coming directly
over from the European press.  There are mountains of  details...
There are many other issues that are simply anomalies -- two sets
of 'facts' that completely contradict each other."
   EIR  then  gives  further  info  on surviving bodyguard Trevor
Rees-Jones:  "Today's (ca.  9/30/97) Guardian has a lengthy story
that I would hope at least be briefly reported in the U.S. press.
(But I'm not going  to  hold  my  breath.)  A detailed account of
several days of  DEBRIEFING  of  Trevor  Rees-Jones.   And  *now*
they're  coming  out  saying that, in fact, the whole story about
his loss of memory was  simply  put  out to the media to distract
attention away from the fact that they were busy debriefing him."

Dr. Cyril Wecht, a well-respected forensic  pathologist  who  has
questioned  official  versions  of the JFK and Martin Luther King
assassinations, was  cautious  in  his  assessment  of  the Diana
death.   Without  hard  evidence,  at  this  point  the  case  is
circumstantial.  Wecht has questions:  *Who*  gave  driver  Henri
Paul  his  prescriptions for tiapride and prozac?  *Why* did Dodi
Fayed allow his driver to go so fast?  *What* was in Dodi Fayed's
blood? Did *he* have alcohol? Did *he* have drugs?

A reporter from the New York  Post added her thoughts:  Diana may
have wanted to "get back"  at  the  royal  family;  this  wedding
suited  *her* agenda.  Cautioning TV-land about the Internet, the
reporter adds,  "Don't  speak  about  the  Internet,  because any
imbecile who can type is on the Internet.  So you cannot gain any
information from the Internet."  Then the New York Post  reporter
lets loose with a shocker; says she, "People in Paris with whom I
just  visited  yesterday,  who are very close to the Ritz [Hotel]
and the royal fam..... the  royals  there,  they also said (and I
don't know that I believe this), 'Yes. We've heard that she *was*
pregnant.' And also (because she wanted  to  'get  back'  at  the
queen),  she  was  *considering*  becoming a Muslim.  This is the
*gossip*."

Summing it all up,  the  Guardian  reporter,  asked about what is
being said now in England, replies, "In England, they're probably
blaming the Americans...  I mean, conspiracy theories -- it seems
a particularly American phenomenon.  Largely because you have  so
many incredibly high-profile assassinations."
