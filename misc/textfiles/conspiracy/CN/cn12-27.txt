OUR RULER, BUSH
===============
(But Who Rules Bush?)
---------------------

The U.S. presidency is not the ultimate level of power; there are
several rungs of power =above= that of U.S. President.  As stated
by Larry Nichols,  "[Bill]  Clinton  is  not  the  power.  He's a
cheap, tin man... he's probably a 5th- to 7th-level player.   And
Jackson  Stephens (the people that own Clinton) are probably 3rd-
or 4th-level. I don't even =know= who's the 1st- and 2nd-level!"

The late CIA  Director  William  Colby  once  described the ideal
agent as a faceless, grey man, the sort that no one notices.  And
which ex-President is keeping a low profile since leaving office?
Strange how presumably political George Bush now is  seen  mostly
at  golf tournaments.  Has George Bush, Sr., after decades at the
centers of power, suddenly lost interest in it all?

The Bush clan traces  its  ancestry  back to auld England.  Their
roots go back to King Henry III and George Bush is  a  thirteenth
cousin,  twice  removed,  of  Queen Elizabeth II.  You may recall
that George Bush, Sr., was  knighted  a few years ago, making him
"Sir Bush" or "Lord Bush."

The future Lord, while a student at Yale University, was inducted
into the secret Skull & Bones society.  Antony C. Sutton, in  his
book,  *America's Secret Establishment*, writes as follows on the
ultra-secret Skull & Bones society:

  Those on the  inside  know  it  as  The Order.  Others have
  known it for more than 150 years as Chapter 322 of a German
  secret society.  More formally,  for  legal  purposes,  The
  Order was incorporated as The Russell Trust in 1856.

According  to Robert Gaylon Ross, Sr., in his book, *Who's Who Of
The Elite*, "The Order [Skull  & Bones] is powerful, unbelievably
powerful...  Honors and financial rewards are guaranteed  by  the
power of The Order.  But the price of these honors and rewards is
sacrifice to the common goal, the goal of The Order."

Lord Bush has a mythology surrounding him which misrepresents him
as  some  sort of entrepreneur "wild catter" in the oil business.
In fact, according to Brigadier General (ret.)  Russell S. Bowen,
George Bush, Sr.'s, Zapata  Oil  Company  "owes its success to an
ability to  negotiate  contracts  with  large  international  oil
companies   in  competition  with  140  other  offshore  drilling
companies.  Zapata has  taken  advantage  of government financing
programs and especially U.S. government-guaranteed ship-financing
securities..." (*The Immaculate Deception*)

Zapata Oil would come in handy for  Bush  over  the  years  as  a
front,  disguising  his  CIA activities.  For example, before and
after the Bay of Pigs  fiasco  of 1961, Bush worked directly with
anti-Castro Cuban groups using his Zapata Oil as a cover.

In the  late  1970s/early  1980s,  George  Bush  was  part  of  a
successful plot to delay the release of American hostages held by
Iran,  so  as  to sabotage Jimmy Carter's re-election hopes; this
plot is known as  "The  October  Surprise."  (See CN 9.53) Around
this time also, Ronald Reagan was ordered by the Rockefellers  to
"choose"  George  Bush,  Sr., as his running mate during the 1980
presidential  race.   Then,  the  1981  assassination  attempt on
Ronald Reagan occurred.  That assassination attempt was part of a
larger  plot.   John  Hinckley,  Jr.,  the  supposed  "lone   nut
assassin,"  is  the son of John Hinckley, Sr. John Hinckley, Sr.,
is the  owner  of  Vanderbilt  Oil  and  had  been,  for years, a
neighbor of George Bush, Sr. Hinckley, Sr., had  been  a  regular
"campaign  contributor"  to  George  Bush, Sr., for decades.  And
there are other troubling  questions about the 1981 assassination
attempt on Ronald Reagan as well.   (See  "Statement  of  Colonel
(ret.) James 'Bo' Gritz," in notes below.)

Once  Ronald  Reagan  had  been sworn in as President in 1981, it
appears he didn't  defer  enough  to  his  Vice President, George
Bush, Sr. Reagan perhaps  thought  that,  as  President,  he  was
basically  in  charge.   He  received  a  strong  message  to the
contrary  when  he  was   almost   killed  two  months  into  his
presidency.    After   fortuitously   surviving   the   attempted
assassination, Reagan knew that he'd  better  let  George  handle
certain things.

The  *de  facto* U.S. President from 1981 through 1992 was George
Herbert Walker Bush, Sr.  Then,  in  1992, George Bush threw away
his chances for re-election, giving it away to William  Jefferson
Clinton.   Bill  Clinton,  like  George  Bush, is a long-time CIA
asset.  Clinton, according to the  book, *Partners In Power*, was
recruited by CIA way back when he was a student at Oxford in  the
late  1960s.   Secret  Bush-Clinton  connections are unearthed in
such books as *Compromised* and *Boy Clinton*. 

Waiting in the  wings  is  George  Bush,  Jr.,  SON  OF BUSH, now
Governor  of  Texas.   George,  Jr.'s,  apparently   pre-ordained
election  as  U.S. President in the year 2000 (see CN 10.85) will
continue the Bush  dynasty,  begun  in  1981  after the attempted
assassination of Ronald Reagan. But who rules Bush?

---------------------------<< Notes >>---------------------------

Excerpts from a  talk  given  by  Lt.  Col.  "Bo"  Gritz in Mesa,
Arizona on April 4, 1992.

In Mesa, I met with him [Cleon Skaas(?)] and I said, "Why in  the
world  did  Ronald  Reagan sell us down the tube by taking George
Bush as his running mate?"   And  I really didn't know that Cleon
knew Ronald Reagan rather well.  But he told me:  He  said,  "Bo,
George  Bush  was  Ronald Reagan's greatest opponent," (if you'll
remember, back in the 1980 elections), "and Ronald Reagan said he
would never have him.   Then,  Ronald  Reagan  was invited to New
York to go see Rockefeller.  When  he  saw  Rockefeller,  he  was
told,  'If you do not take my head of the Trilateral Commission'"
(remember, the Council  on  Foreign  Relations, George Bush) "'as
your running mate, the only way you'll  see  the  inside  of  the
White House is as a tourist.'"

Two months after he was  inaugurated,  two  months  is  all  that
Ronald  Reagan  lasted.   March  30th, 1981, two months after his
inauguration  in January of 1981, he was shot -- was he not?  And
the news said that he was shot by John Hinckley,  Jr.,  and  that
John  Hinckley,  Jr., was some kind of a Jodie Foster freak.  And
that he came out of nowhere, and  that he shot Brady in the head,
and he shot a policeman in the neck, and he shot a Secret Service
man and blew him back  over  the  vehicle,  and  he  shot  Ronald
Reagan.  Right?

Well,  remember  the  hardware.   That's  why I gave you a little
introduction...  I did.   [Gritz  had  talked  earlier about some
sophisticated "tools of the trade."] Soon as I see this  stuff  I
begin  to  wonder,  because  I've  been  a part of these kinds of
operations.  Let's just go back and review.  It's all in the book
[*Called to  Serve*(?)],  and  so,  very  quickly  I'll  run down
through you.

When  Brady was shot, no question.  Here we've got John Hinckley,
Jr., Oh, by the way, is  John  Hinckley, Jr., just some kind of a
"weirdo?"  Isn't it strange that John Hinckley, Sr., is the owner
of Vanderbilt Oil?  And, of course, George Bush is the  owner  of
Zapata  Oil. Was it a coincidence, then, that John Hinckley, Sr.,
and George Bush  are  neighbors  *for  years*  in Houston, Texas,
working together?  Is it any coincidence that John Hinckley, Sr.,
when  you  go  back  through  the  FEC,  the   Federal   Election
Commission, his own record of giving maximum donations every year
to Mr. Bush even when he started running for Congress.  Well now,
does  that  make  his  son, John Hinckley, Jr., seem a little bit
less of a coincidence?  I think it does.  Here's why:

When  the  President  was shot, if you'll remember, he was pushed
into the car by a man  named  Jerry Parr(sp?) that was his Secret
Service guard.  Jerry Parr fell on top of him and, I just saw  in
the  *Reader's  Digest* where Jerry Parr was telling his "valiant
story."  And the limousine tore off, didn't it?  Now it was *five
minutes later* that the ambulance arrived and they put the Secret
Service man, the  Washington,  D.C.  policeman,  and Brady in the
ambulance and *it* roared off.  Using normal  time-rate/distance,
who  should have arrived at George Washington University Hospital
first?  The President should have.  Well, who did?  You know it's
a trick question.  The  ambulance  arrived  15 minutes before the
President.  When  asked,  "What  happened?"  the  Secret  Service
simply responded, "We got lost."

The  Secret  Service  does  not get lost in Washington, D.C. They
don't get lost in  most  places  of  the  world.  And so, now the
investigation starts to get a little interesting.  When they take
Ronald Reagan in, they can see that he...  matter  of  fact,  his
heart almost stopped.  And he is convulsing; there's blood on his
lips.   They  know  he's hurt... seriously.  But they can find no
wounds.  They X-ray him *3 times* and can find nothing.

Finally, a nurse  notices  a  tiny  entrance  wound  right at the
seventh rib, underneath the armpit.  And a doctor takes a  probe,
and  by... very carefully, because they couldn't see it on X-ray,
the doctor is  able  to  extract  what  he  said  was a planchet,
thinner than a  dime,  that  was  one-quarter  inch  from  Ronald
Reagan's aorta.

Now,  Ronald  Reagan says... as a matter of fact, let me just see
if I can just read it to  you... best what Ronnie says.  I've got
all this in the book...  This came right out of a newspaper:

  I knew I had been hurt, but I thought that I'd been hurt by
  the  Secret  Service  man  landing on me in the car.  As it
  was, I must  say  it  was  the  most paralyzing pain.  I've
  described it as if someone hit  you with a hammer.  But the
  sensation, it seemed to me, came after I was in the car and
  so  I  thought that maybe his gun or something had broken a
  rib.  I set up on the  seat,  and the pain wouldn't go away
  -- and suddenly, I found I was coughing up blood.

Now you see, to almost anyone else you  might  say,  "Well,  just
some  kind  of  a fluke."  But I'm a skeptic.  Because I know how
these things  have  happened  ever  since  they  "took  out" John
Fitzgerald Kennedy.  I  think  maybe  JFK  was  the  last  honest
President that we had...
