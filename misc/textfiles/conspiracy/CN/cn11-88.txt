  FEMINIST INTELLIGENCE NETWORK PUTS BILL CLINTON IN DOG HOUSE
  ============================================================
    Cunning Coup By "Dumb Blondes" Shows Blondes Not So Dumb
    --------------------------------------------------------

In September 1979,  the  "Red  Stockings  Collective," a group of
radical feminists, issued a statement which read, in part

  We feel we must respond  to  the  latest  in  a  series  of
  attempts  to  suppress  the  inquiry  into  the details and
  nature of  Gloria  Steinem's  association  with the Central
  Intelligence Agency.  We are alarmed that the most  visible
  commentary  on  these  events comes from several well-known
  figures in the feminist  movement  who not only condone but
  endorse this suppression. [1]

This statement issued by the Red Stockings was the culmination of
years-long efforts by that  group  to  expose infiltration of the
feminist movement by the CIA.  The "alarm" expressed by  the  Red
Stockings  in  their  statement  suggests  that  the  "well-known
figures  in the feminist movement" are themselves part of the CIA
apparatus.  As early as 1975,  the  Berkeley Barb had reported on
the Red Stockings' investigations:

  A group of women  tied-in  with  the  origins of the modern
  Women's Liberation Movement and concerned about its future,
  who call themselves "Red  Stockings,"  have  been  able  to
  piece  together enough documentation to convincingly expose
  and  describe  the   Ms.  Magazine/Steinem/CIA  connection.
  Moreover, the  Red  Stockings  have  closely  examined  the
  financial  backing  and  contents  of Ms. Magazine and have
  arrived at the conclusion  that  the  ideology put forth by
  Ms. has been positively harmful to  the  Women's  Movement.
  [2] 

One  of  the  principle  financial  backers  of  Ms. Magazine was
Katherine Graham of the Washington Post.  [3] Also  part  of  the
Katherine  Graham  empire has been Newsweek magazine, employer of
Eleanor Clift, staunch backer  of the Clinton/Rodham White House.
And Katherine Graham and the Washington Post itself are long-time
affiliates of CIA, for example during the  Watergate  years  when
they  were  part  of  the "soft coup d'etat" orchestrated against
Richard Nixon.  [4] The  first  publisher  of  Ms.  Magazine  was
Elizabeth Forsling Harris.  She is  mentioned in volume 4 of Penn
Jones, Jr's opus on the John F. Kennedy  assassination,  *Forgive
My Grief* [excerpts]:

  The  Women's  Liberation  Movement,  as  well  as the Youth
  Movement,  must  constantly  be  aware  of  the  problem of
  infiltration by enemies.  In fact, the [Women's] Liberation
  group may very well have been taken over already by the Ms.
  [Magazine] publisher, Elizabeth Forsling Harris.

  Elizabeth Forsling Harris was a very close  co-worker  with
  Jack  Pewterbaugh.   And  it  was  Pewterbaugh who made the
  decision to take the unauthorized and unnecessary detour in
  Dealey Plaza.

It  is beyond question that, over the years, the CIA has employed
and/or funded women in their  operations, including at the covert
level, as secret operatives in various fields such as journalism,
sting operations, political movements, academia, and spying.  And
many of these women agents are  naturally  sympathetic  to  Elite
Feminist  doctrines.   Was  the  Monica  Lewinsky  matter a sting
operation, employing an either  witting or unwitting Ms. Lewinsky
as a tool preying on male weakness?  In  the  previous  issue  of
Conspiracy Nation  (CN),  I  wrote  that  Monica  Lewinsky, Linda
Tripp, and Lucianne  Goldberg  "all  belong  to  a  loosely-based
Feminist   Intelligence   Network   (FIN),  which  parallels  and
intersects other intelligence networks."

Today  (02/13/98), in the Washington Times, Wesley Pruden expands
on the possibility that InternGate originated as a power struggle
in the White House.   The  two  competing factions struggling for
the President's ear are personified by Hillary  Rodham  and  Dick
Morris.   Morris  himself  may  have  been ousted from power by a
sting operation, when he was  maneuvered out onto a hotel balcony
where a photographer for The Star just happened to be nearby.  In
"President Rodham's White House Coup," Mr. Pruden writes in  part
that

  Dick  Morris,  who  understands this administration like no
  one else, says  the  coup  at  the  White  House is already
  complete.   "The  minute  President  Clinton   was   thrown
  irredeemably  on  the  defensive  on  Jan. 21, Hillary took
  over."  Mr. Morris writes  in  his  column in the Hill, the
  political newspaper of Capitol Hill, "The bargain is  clear
  to  both  the president and the first lady.  She need never
  articulate it.  He  intuits  it.   Here's the deal:  She'll
  [and press allies] bail him out of this mess, but now,  she
  calls  the  shots.   The  president,  hanging by his wife's
  largesse, knows enough to step  aside.  From now on it will
  be her appointments, her policies, her positions  that  get
  green lights." 
                                           -- [Excerpts only]

Note  how  the press, first so relentless in their attack on Bill
Clinton,  is  now  equivocating  on  the  Lewinsky  matter.   The
Feminist Intelligence Network (FIN) has had to walk a  fine  line
in this latest scandal:  first, going for Bill Clinton's jugular;
then  easing  off just enough so the President knows they can get
him at any time.  Of course, FIN  is not an official agency -- it
doesn't need to be.  Like Freemasonic organizations of old, it is
just a  loose  network  of  like-minded  individuals,  permeating
positions of power, who act in concert to achieve their goals.

Likely members of FIN include
** Roberta Achtenberg (HUD)
** Madeleine Albright (Secretary of State)
** Maya Angelou (Poet)
** Carol Bellamy (Peace Corps)
** Carol Browner (EPA)
** Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Supreme Court)
** Hazel O'Leary (Former Energy Secretary)
** Janet Reno (Attorney General)
** Alice Rivlin (OMB)
** Donna Shalala (Health & Human Services)
** Laura D'Andrea Tyson (Council of Economic Advisors)
** Eleanor Clift (Journalist)

It is not meant to be  taken  that women ought not hold positions
of power.  What is urged is that there be  an  awareness  of  the
fact that Elite Feminism constitutes a secret society, not always
operating  in  the  open and subject to public scrutiny.  What is
vitally needed at this point  is  for women not locked-into Elite
Feminist doctrine to act as spies.  Information  is  needed.   If
you  are  a  woman,  you will be able to infiltrate secret "women
only" meetings of Elite Feminists.   From  there, you can "play a
part" and rise into the higher degrees of  FIN.   Send  what  you
discover to Conspiracy Nation; confidentiality assured.
