        (From Mr. Skolnick's recorded message: 312-731-1100)

Hi!   Sherman  Skolnick,  Citizens'  Committee  to  Clean  Up the
Courts, 9800 S. Oglesby.
 
Some say the First Lady is facing criminal indictments,  and  the
indictments  (some  state, some federal) have already been handed
up by a grand jury but the indictments have been sealed.
 
Is all this political?   Before  the  election  it would cause an
unprecedented situation.  Bill Clinton might  feel  compelled  to
resign,  but  at  the  same  time  release  his impounded medical
records, showing, supposedly, some medical crisis -- such as, his
nose might fall off from having  snorted cocaine over a period of
many years.
 
Release of indictments against Hillary after the  election  could
also  be  considered  political.  If the Independent Counsel knew
before the election, why would he time the release for after?
 
Of course,  remember  the  Nixon  situation:   Prior  to the 1972
landslide re-election, the press fakers  played  down  Watergate.
By  the  Spring of 1973, however, Watergate was the buzzword most
every day.
 
And what is Hillary facing?   In  New York, charges of defrauding
the state  while  a  consultant;  in  Little  Rock,  causing  the
misappropriation  of federally insured funds of a savings & loan;
in the District of  Columbia,  perjury and obstruction of justice
regarding both Travelgate and  Filegate;  that  is,  causing  the
frame-up  of  White  House Travel Office carry-over employees and
using FBI records to  blackmail  various persons, primarily those
of the Bush administration.
 
A good question:  *When* are they going  to  indict  Hillary  and
Bill  for the $50 million embezzlement and massive tax fraud that
is the subject of *our* civil damage suit against her and others?
So far, Hillary Clinton's  defense  is  primarily to convince the
federal judges in Chicago that we are, supposedly,  "bad  people"
and no judge should listen to us!
 
Of  course,  the  federal  judges  here  already  hate us for our
campaign of exposing bribery of the federal courts in Chicago.
 
Now  whether  before   or   after   the  election,  the  expected
indictments may cause a crisis.  Even prior  to  the  indictments
the stock market was already reaching new,  all-time  highs,  and
headed  for  a crash.  (Of course, cynics contend that the market
would rally!  That is, happy to be rid of the Clinton White House
gang.)
 
Now just consider the possibilities.  The mass  media  liars  and
whores  might  finally  have  to  admit  that  White House Deputy
Counsel Vincent W. Foster, Jr.  was  murdered.  And that Bill and
Hillary, supposedly his friends, covered it up.  Vince Foster was
implicated in various types of espionage, such as selling nuclear
missile secrets to a foreign power; such as heading a project  to
spy   on   foreign   banks,   both   friend   and  foe;  such  as
money-laundering dope and gun-running  funds, with Hillary, for a
Little Rock bond broker:  some 18 Arkansas-based firms  would  be
scandalized  for  reportedly  using  dope  loot  to finance their
business --  including  Tyson  Chickens,  J.B.  Hunt  truck line,
Wal-Mart, and Beverly Enterprises, the nursing home  chain.   The
whole  mess  involves  both political parties:  both Bill Clinton
and George Bush are criminally implicated in the CIA dope through
the airport at Mena, Arkansas.   And the dope loot was reportedly
washed through  the  Garfield  Ridge  Trust  &  Savings  Bank  of
Chicago,  owned  by  de-frocked  congressman Dan Rostenkowski and
Hillary's brother, and then through the Chicago markets.
 
The bottom line?  Maybe all of  this  is  to pave the way for Jay
Rockefeller to become the President without an  actual  election.
Such as by an emergency, provided for under the 25th Amendment.
 
Will the press  fakers  surprise  us  with  all  of this someday?
*Or*, just dribble it out to get us used to a disaster?
