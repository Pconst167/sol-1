UPDATE: AMBASSADOR LEO WANTA
============================
By "Tom in Venice" (former Democratic Party operative)
------------------------------------------------------
(Further background: See CN 10.92)

1) Ambassador Leo Wanta remains under house arrest in Wisconsin.

2) According to  Wanta's  attorney,  Pat  Cammeron, the Wisconsin
Department of Revenue has until October 24th to produce the court
and legal documents that would prove the Department of  Revenue's
case.  Cammeron says they have no case at all *vis a vis* $14,129
supposedly owed in taxes.

3)  Now with the frame-up against Ambassador Wanta falling apart,
a new frame-up has been brought against Wanta by Wisconsin.

4) The Wisconsin  Department  of  Revenue  is claiming that Wanta
owes $675,000, referencing Falls Vending Machine (a reputed Mafia
operation.)

5) Falls Vending, a company that Wanta helped lead a sting on  in
1981,  has  ties  to former FBI agent Mike DeMarco, federal judge
Russell Eisenberg, and current FBI Director Louis Freeh.

6) Freeh has yet to respond  to Cammeron's demand that his agency
account for the contents in "Wanta's" briefcase.

7) According to Cammeron, a source  in  Switzerland  claims  that
former-President George Bush will work with Louis Freeh to create
more  Wanta  frame-ups,  in  order to keep Wanta from telling the
truth.

8) This individual in Switzerland who fingered Bush just recently
survived an assassination attempt against him by car bomb.

9) So what we  have  here  is  a  criminal conspiracy to obstruct
justice   being   orchestrated   by   Governor   Tommy   Thompson
(Wisconsin),  former-President  George  Bush,  and  current   FBI
Director  Louis  Freeh.  (USCA Title 18 Section 35; Section 241 &
242)

10) Freeh, a Bush man  himself, seems more interested in pursuing
Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.'s phone calls than the  financial
misconduct  of  both  President Clinton and former-President Bush
involving  the  AmeriTrust  account  in  Switzerland.  Ambassador
Wanta could shed light on this subject, as it  dovetails  to  the
death of Vince Foster, Jr.

11)   Ambassador   Wanta's  testimony  in  front  of  the  Senate
Intelligence panel is needed not  only  to bring Clinton and Bush
to justice, but expose key "bunko man" Kenneth Starr for what  he
is.

             -+- Afterword by Conspiracy Nation -+-

Kenneth  Starr  is  one  of  the much-vaunted Special Prosecutors
we've seen in the past decade or so.  Another was Lawrence Walsh,
who drew a comfortable salary while he wiled away lazy afternoons
sipping lemonade  and  investigating  Iran-Contra.  Walsh finally
issued his report, but by  then  no  one  cared.   Starr  too  is
enjoying  a  comfy job and will issue some sort of (yawn) report.
Now Janet Reno is under pressure  to appoint yet another of these
comfortable fellows, these Special Prosecutors.  Latest theory on
these "independent" appointees is that they are part of political
blackmail operations:  they have wide-ranging special  powers  to
dig  up  dirt,  and  the  dirt then gets held over the opposition
party's head -- give  us  (politically)  what we want, *or else*!
Note how when President Clinton used his line-item  veto  to  cut
out  military  pork previously destined for Newt Gingrich's state
of  Georgia,  we  "coincidentally"  had   a  week  of  fuss  over
"discovered" Clinton videotapes:  Is there a  connection  between
the two events?

Conspiracy  Nation  normally  shuns  predictions,  and itself has
almost never made any.   From  time to time, however, predictions
from others are passed along.  Here  is  what  I'm  hearing  from
others, that is sufficiently corroborated to deserve notice.

Things  seem  about to blow in that modern "Rome on the Potomac,"
Washington, DC.  Recall that in  past issues of Conspiracy Nation
(CN 10.79, CN 10.80,  CN  10.81,  ca.  early August 1997) various
sources foresaw trouble in October for Bill Clinton and his gang.
"Ru Mills" warned that "Thanksgiving" would come early this year,
with "the turkey," Bill Clinton, to be carved in  late  September
or   early   October.    Human  Events  magazine  was  predicting
indictments and possible ouster  of  Mr. Bill Clinton.  R. Emmett
Tyrrell, Jr. of American Spectator magazine echoed Human  Events:
"...the  Clinton  White  House is going to go sky-high... several
major scandals are certain to  rock  the Clinton White House this
year."

I am still hearing the same general thing from my  sources.   "Ru
Mills"  sees  upheaval  by  the end of October.  Sherman Skolnick
hints at a stock market crash  on or about October 20th.  "Tom in
Venice" feels that things are heating up. 

And what does Conspiracy Nation say?  (1) Be cautious with  these
types  of  predictions;  we've heard them for years now.  (2) But
who knows?   I'm  hearing  these  dark  forebodings  from several
sources.  (3) *If* Clinton gets in hot water, he  can  just  send
missiles  against  "punching  bag"  Saddam Hussein's Iraq or some
other nation that can't too  effectively fight back.  (Subtext of
Clinton missile fury is, "And if I can do it to them, I can do it
to you.") Clinton also, notably, is doing the  "representing  you
all in a foreign land" stunt:   you don't want "our" President to
look bad in  front  of  the  neighbors,  do  you?   Bottom  line:
Clinton  the  Weasel  will  get  out of it; you will keep getting
poorer;  you  will have to work longer hours; nothing will change
insofar as by some  great  magic  the  truth  will be forced into
public consciousness.  But it's Monday morning and  we  all  need
hope,  right?
