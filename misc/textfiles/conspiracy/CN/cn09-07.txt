IRAQ'S SADDAM HUSSEIN, GEORGE BUSH, AND THE OIL KICK-BACKS
==========================================================
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
What do the press fakers really tell us about Iraq?  For example,
in October, 1990, at the time of the Persian Gulf conflict, there
was an unpublicized case in the Chicago  Federal  District  Court
(No.  90  C  6863).   The  Illinois  Bank  Commissioner sought an
injunction against the Federal  Reserve  Board  to stop them from
turning over certain bank records to the House Banking Committee.
The records were those of the Chicago branch of  Italy's  largest
[bank], Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, owned in part by the Vatican.
 
Called  BNL, it had records of Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein and
his secret private joint  business  dealings with his partner, an
American.  A close crony of the Federal Reserve, Chicago  Federal
District  Judge  Brian  Barnett  Duff,  ordered the return of any
records from the Banking  Committee,  then  headed by a Democrat,
Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas).
 
The House Banking Committee was an intervening party-litigant  in
the  controversy.   Judge  Duff  so  opposed  the  House  Banking
Committee's  efforts  to  get those records, that the Judge would
not listen to the Committee's attorney; did not want the attorney
in the Judge's  courtroom,  the  Judge  calling  him an 800 pound
gorilla showing no respect for the court.
 
In May, 1991, right after the War ended in the Persian Gulf,  the
case  ended  up  in the Federal Appeals Court in Chicago; a court
dominated by Judges tied to  the  major  banks and cronies of the
Federal Reserve.  I was  the  only  journalist  at  the  hearing.
Afterwards,   in   the   back   of  the  courtroom,  two  hearing
participants confirmed to me  that  the records were about George
Bush being Saddam  Hussein's  secret  private  business  partner.
Later,  only  one  sizeable  newspaper  dared  publish  my report
("Spotlight," August 19, 1991).
 
The appeals court decision was  to  be made several months later.
In  the  meantime,  President  Bush  got  his   crooked   Justice
Department  to  circulate  blackmail  whispers  that  one  of the
3-judge panel of  that  appeal,  Judge  Richard Posner (now Chief
Judge) took bribes in 8 other cases -- which we already  knew  to
be  true!  Strange, but later the blackmail apparently succeeded.
The federal appeals panel  ordered  the case entirely removed, so
to speak, from the courthouse.  We have one of the few copies  of
the court record.
 
The  hearing  participants,  in  May,  1991,  had  told  me  that
revealing   the   records   would  tend  to  undermine  the  bank
regulator's supervision of banks and would cause an international
incident and possibly a run on banks, and the banking system.
 
Confirmed to me  was  what  the  records  were all about.  Saddam
Hussein was considered the Bully Boy of  the  Persian  Gulf  from
1980  to  1990.  (Saddam had been created as the dictator of Iraq
in the  late  1970s,  right  about  or  after  the  time Bush was
Director of Central Intelligence --  Bush  and  the  CIA  created
Saddam.)   All  the  Persian  Gulf  oil  producers  secretly gave
kick-backs to Saddam of 25 percent of the one trillion dollars of
oil shipped to the West in that decade.  For the 1980s, that came
out to about 25 billion dollars  per year, or 250 billion dollars
for ten years, Saddam shared with his secret partner George  Bush
and Bush's cronies.
 
With  that  loot, Saddam Hussein became one of the richest men on
the planet.  He has been one  of the largest owners of the French
company, Matra, which owns the  People  Mover  system  at  O'Hare
International  Airport,  Chicago  -- moving people and baggage to
the airplanes.  U.S. officials  mouth off about airport security.
What a joke!  The Iraqi is also the owner of Hachette, owners  of
several   U.S.  magazines.   (Do  they  propagandize  for  Iraq?)
Saddam's half-brother in Switzerland  said if CIA murders Saddam,
the records will be released putting Bush in prison for treason.
 
With  his  share  of the oil kick-back loot, Bush owns reportedly
most of the real  estate  in  or near Silicon Valley, California,
home of high tech (reportedly  through  a  company  front  called
Hidalgo  --  Bush  likes  Hispanic  names).  Bush is also a major
owner of Pennzoil that corrupted the Texas Supreme Court to put a
competitor, Texaco, into false  bankruptcy,  largest of its kind,
12 billion dollars.  And Bush as Vice President, later President,
corrupted the U.S. Supreme Court to  favor  his  firm,  Pennzoil,
when  the  Texaco  case  got  there.   Texaco,  dominated thus by
Pennzoil, has been tied to oil shipped from Iraq.
 
On behalf of the Jackson  Stephens bond house, largest outside of
Wall Street, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vincent W.  Foster,  Jr.,
arranged  for  BNL  and  its  companion/twin,  Bank of Credit and
Commerce International [BCCI],  to  spread  out  in the U.S. with
several branches.  (One sizeable paper, "Spotlight,"  Oct.  1991,
published  my report of BCCI bribing both houses of Congress, 108
Representatives and some 28 U.S. Senators.)
 
Also, Foster and Mrs. Clinton secretly arranged, with George Bush
and  others  {1},  to  have  weapons shipments from U.S. firms to
Iraq.   Some  were  disguised  as  Agriculture  Department  loans
through  BNL-Atlanta   (the   role   of  Bush/Foster/Hillary  was
concealed.)  Mrs. Clinton was either  a  director  and/or  lawyer
arranging strategy of some of the weapons makers.  And there is a
tie-in  reportedly through a shadowy character called Barbouti of
Houston   and    Cardoen    {2},    Miami    and    Chile,   with
Bush/Foster/Hillary,  with  secret  shipments  to  Iraq  of  U.S.
chemicals to make poison gas to use against U.S. troops.
 
Notice these dates:  July 17, 1993, there was a plot, believed to
be genuine, by CIA and others in the U.S., to assassinate  Saddam
Hussein.  Major papers in the U.S. did not publish the same until
on  or  about  11/1/93.  The plot was aborted, apparently by high
White House officials {3}, apparently Clinton  himself.   Result:
several  Iraqi  officials,  secretly  co-operating with CIA, were
murdered by Saaddam.  Then on July 19, 1993, FBI Director William
Sessions was sacked by President  Clinton because Sessions had an
elite unit investigating high crimes by Clinton  and  Bush.   The
next  day,  Foster,  involved  in various espionage projects, was
apparently murdered.
 
No wonder President Clinton and the First Lady have been covering
up the strange death of Vincent W. Foster, Jr.
 
We, as ordinary Americans, are  in  a season of treachery in high
places. WHAT IS THE REASON, NONE DARE CALL IT TREASON?
 
---------------------------<< Notes >>---------------------------
{1} Regarding the Clinton-Bush  connection, see *Boy Clinton*, by
R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., which documents a  meeting  between  Bill
Clinton  and  George  Bush  in  Portland,  Maine  and  at  Bush's
Kennebunkport home.
 
{2} Regarding Cardoen, recall the following from CN 8.75:
 
  BOB IRVIN:
  Carlos Cardoen? Did you ever run across him?
 
  GENE TATUM:
  No.
 
  BOB IRVIN:
  He was from Chile.  But he  came up and had meetings in the
  States, private little meetings.   I  think  one  was  with
  [then-CIA Director] Gates in southern Florida.
 
  ANDREW DUNN:
  Chilean arms dealer. [Cardoen]
 
  BOB IRVIN:
  He sold the cluster  bombs  to  Saddam [Hussein].  Which we
  gave him the technology for.
 
  ANDREW DUNN:
  That was the "Third World shuffle" you were talking  about:
  you  know,  get  stuff  down to a friendly country where we
  don't have export restrictions.
 
{3}  "The  plot  was  aborted,  apparently  by  high  White House
officials..."  The  phrase,  "high  White  House  officials," has
taken on a whole new meaning of late.
