"SHUT YOUR MOUTH"
=================
Details of the O.J. Simpson Affair
----------------------------------
By Sherman H. Skolnick
----------------------
 
Harsh realities need to be understood.  Yet, the mainstream press
seldom tells us.  Just as  if  someone out there is saying, "Shut
your mouth!"
 
A case in point is the O.J. Simpson Affair.
 
HARSH REALITY #1 -- SHUT YOUR MOUTH:  To be a major sports  star,
do you have to get along well with criminal interests?
 
Does  that  make you a mafia crony, or just promoting your career
in the face of  the  real  world?   Skeptics  need to examine the
federal case of Norby Walters and Lloyd Bloom.  The court  trial,
1988-89,  showed  that  known  gangsters seemed to control sports
agents who,  in  turn,  controlled  sports  stars.   (One  of the
mafia-dominated sports agents was later murdered.)  Cynics  point
to  the  fact  that a higher court judge, reportedly pals himself
with mafioso, overturned  the  convictions  of  the sports agents
charged with corruption and threats.
 
The major news organs are heavily into sports  promoting.   Some,
like the Chicago Tribune, own a baseball team (The Cubs).  The TV
networks  reportedly  find it necessary to be cronies of criminal
interests in  promoting  sports  events.   It  is called avoiding
financial hang-ups.
 
So if we conclude that O.J. Simpson, from early  in  his  career,
found   it   necessary  to  be  a  gangster  pal,  should  we  be
sympathetic?  Probably so.   As  a  former  sports hero, O.J. was
sponsored by Hertz, the car rental firm.  Going back  into  their
history,  one  finds  that  they reportedly were no angels.  Some
savvy folks whisper  that  Hertz,  in  the  past  if not also the
present, were reportedly close to criminals.
 
And O.J. reportedly was a sizeable owner in a nationwide  storage
firm  reportedly  started  by  an intelligence agent who was also
close to foreign and  domestic  gangsters.  (The founder was sent
to prison for massive S&L fraud in California.)
 
The list of O.J.'s reported criminal links goes on and on.
 
O.J. reportedly owned several fast food stores.  Sounds  innocent
enough.   As  part  of  the  bitter divorce, ex-wife Nicole Brown
Simpson got control of  some  of  those businesses.  And into the
picture   were   brought   corrupt   police   brass   as   secret
owners/operators.  The places were reportedly  turned  into  dope
distribution  centers,  with  the  huge  cash  flow  disguised as
proceeds from business. 
 
Remember:  food stores, restaurants, and other large receivers of
cash, are  exempt  from  U.S.  Treasury  regulations  requiring a
report on where more than ten thousand  dollars  comes  from,  if
deposited with a financial entity like a bank.
 
And  the funds from the stores, as well as from some of the Hertz
franchises she controlled,  were  washed through California banks
-- most of which are owned  by  the  Japanese,  and  a  principal
portion being the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza.
 
HARSH  REALITY  #2  --  SHUT  YOUR  MOUTH:   Two major dope gangs
distribute  dope  in  California,   and  wash  the  loot  through
businesses and banks.
 
Gang #1 are the Herrera dope  gang  of  Mexico,  tight  with  the
American   CIA.    For  political  survival,  state  and  federal
prosecutors and law enforcement officials know it is forbidden to
start up with the  Herreras.   Safer  to  grab some street corner
doper-nobody.  To  promote  so-called  "national  security,"  the
mainstream press knows it is generally forbidden to publicize spy
agency confederates and CIA's dirty tricks.
 
Dope  gang #2 are the Yakuza who, like the Herreras, are tight as
well with the CIA.  (See  the  book,  "Yakuza" by David E. Kaplan
and Alec Dubro.)
 
Prior to  the  double  murders,  O.J.  reportedly  told  business
associates  that  his  ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman,
and their confederates, were  dealing dope.  O.J. reportedly said
he told Nicole and Ron to stop it, or he would stop  it,  because
the  dope  dealing  was  endangering  his  family  and  his other
businesses. (Was that a threat by O.J.? Stop it? How?)
 
To keep track of this  dope  dealing, and because of his jealousy
of his ex-wife Nicole, O.J. had detectives tracking Nicole  (also
tracking Ron?).
 
THE REPORTED SCENE ON THE NIGHT OF THE DOUBLE MURDERS:  SHUT YOUR
MOUTH! --
 
An  undercover  federal  drug  enforcement  team,  equipped  with
see-in-the-dark video, were tracking Ron. From past surveillance,
they firmly believed he was  part of a widespread homosexual dope
gang, fronting for the Yakuza  --  distributing  the  stuff  *on*
*credit* to fancy people, celebrities and such, contacted through
waiters  (like  Ron)  in  fancy  eating places like the Mezzaluna
Restaurant where Ron worked.   Ron's  reputed sidekick and fellow
waiter was MICHAEL NIGG.  (Was Nigg also Ron's room-mate, or  did
Nigg have a girl friend as a "beard?")
 
THE PHONE CALL: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! --
 
On  the  night of the double horror, Nicole reportedly received a
phone call from a  friend,  pleading  that ex-husband O.J. has to
come up, pronto, with several hundred thousand dollars -- or else
-- to make good a dope debt.
 
THE BUTCHER JOB: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! --
 
Both the narcs and O.J.'s detectives reportedly witnessed  Nicole
and  Ron  cut  up,  Samurai-style, by a dope hit team.  The video
reportedly shows them as 3  or  4 hispanics or orientals.  If the
trial evidence is true, was that O.J.'s shoe-print at the  murder
scene,  *after-the-fact*,  alerted  by  his detectives reportedly
having witnessed the bloodbath?
 
Naive people ask:   Why  didn't  the  narcs and/or the detectives
stop the murders?  For one thing, the narcs know their  top  dogs
at  the  U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration are highly corrupt,
and have given the  Herreras  and  other major dope traffickers a
pass. (See the book, "The Underground Empire," by James Mills.)
 
Also, both teams knew better than to interfere  with  the  bloody
turf wars between the Herreras and the Yakuza in California.
 
Insofar  as  the L.A. police later planted "evidence" implicating
O.J., was this a type of  police "logic"?  "Well, O.J. is in with
criminals anyway, so let's sink him one way or another."
 
THE ROLE OF THE JUDGE AND HIS WIFE: SHUT YOUR MOUTH! --
 
O.J. trial judge Lance Ito  was  reportedly in a position to know
what the double murders were really all about.   His  wife,  L.A.
Police Captain Margaret York, has been in charge of investigating
police  department  corruption.   Captain York reportedly knew of
the other police brass as  the corrupt secret owners/operators of
the fast food sites, formerly O.J.'s businesses (Did  O.J.  still
retain an interest?).
 
Captain  York reportedly also was the liaison to DEA and examined
the files and records of the  undercover narc team as well as the
video.
 
The District Attorney was also  in  a  position  to  know.   O.J.
defense  team  member, lawyer Robert Shapiro, is reportedly close
with known major drug traffickers.  Are they just "clients"?  Did
defense attorney Johnnie Cochran know?  Judge Ito blocked Cochran
from trying to bring up matters  about a dope hit team or similar
items.
 
SHUT YOUR MOUTH! OR YOU ARE DEAD --
 
Others who apparently found out inside details and  the  terrible
secrets  of  the O.J. Simpson Affair apparently had to be snuffed
out.
 
VICTIM #1:   Judge  Ito's  courtroom  bailiff  in  the O.J. case,
Antranik Geuvjehizian, murdered in  July,  1995.   A  TV  network
program  in  a notice in various TV guides, called it by the name
of the series, "Unsolved Mysteries."   But,  it did not go on the
air as scheduled for Friday, October 27, 1995.   So  the  program
has its own unsolved mystery.
 
VICTIM  #2:  Robin Clark, covering the trial for the Philadelphia
Inquirer, a somewhat more  independent  and outspoken paper -- he
apparently was murdered by having his car shoved  into  on-coming
traffic.
 
VICTIM  #3:   His  son  disappeared  during  the  trial.   Was he
kidnapped?  The police did not accept the story when CBS reporter
at the trial Dominic Dunne's son returned.
 
VICTIM #4:  In September, 1995,  about 3 weeks before the verdict
by the jury, Ron Goldman's fellow waiter and  reputed  dope  gang
member,  Michael  Nigg, was murdered by assassins who shot him in
the head.
 
Did any of these victims have inside data about the Mark  Fuhrman
details  --  a  bigoted  L.A.  detective  who  apparently planted
"evidence" incriminating O.J.?  The Fuhrman details -- him hating
blacks and such -- was  that  intentionally  put into the case by
*both*  *sides*?   Defendants  have  been  known   to   pay   for
prosecutors to corruptly sabotage the prosecution of a defendant,
to  save a defendant from jail.  In law, errors in the trial that
could on appeal of a  guilty verdict invalidate that verdict, are
called "reversible errors."  Sometimes they are just  accidental.
Sometimes,  they  are  corruptly arranged.  Were the Mark Fuhrman
bigot-revealing tapes arranged ahead  of  the time -- known ahead
of time -- so that revealing that would throw out later a  guilty
verdict against O.J.?
 
HEY!  CLINTON WHITE HOUSE, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!  TELL THE DEA BOSS TO
SHUT HIS MOUTH! --
 
In the criminal  defense  of  O.J.,  supervising those detectives
(different bunch than those reportedly at the murder scene) was a
former New York cop, long reportedly on the  mafia  payroll.   He
was  reportedly  a silent partner in mafia gay bars and gay disco
bars jointly with Mattie "The Horse" Ianello, now a jail bird.
 
Why was that ex-cop  brought  in  to  head  the detectives of the
defense team?  Reportedly because he is an expert on gay violence
and on *dope* *hit* *teams*.  So  that  was  apparently  early-on
known or suspected of what the double murders were all about.
 
And  this reputed mafia-friendly ex-cop reportedly dug very, very
deep into the dope business.   And  he  came up apparently with a
link to the California turf dope wars between  the  Herreras  and
the  Yakuza, linked to the CIA-dope and guns operation throughout
the southern states, starting in  the 1980s.  Among the links was
to the CIA-dope brought in through the strange airport  at  Mena,
Arkansas,  arranged  by  Ollie  North  and  George Bush.  Clinton
claims now that as governor he  was  told  by the CIA to mind his
own business, that it was one of their covert operations  and  he
was not to interfere.
 
So,  if  the  public  now demands that the secret DEA records and
video of the  double  murders  be  released  --  well, the highly
corrupt DEA bosses are inclined to withstand the  pressure.   And
so  also  opposing  public  disclosure would be the Clinton White
House.  The DEA and Clinton are subject to blackmail, as a result
of the digging reportedly by the ex-cop from New York.
 
Some at DEA reportedly claim  that  they  would like to ask Ron's
father, Fred Goldman, if he knew about his  son's  dope  dealing.
But  Fred  Goldman  has mobilized public opinion to his favor and
may be immune from hard questions like that.
 
This all may be the biggest or one of the biggest scandals of the
20th century --  the  apparatus  of  state and federal government
covering up a double murder.
 
(Note:  Banks reportedly washing the  Yakuza  dope  loot  include
California-headquartered  Bank  of  America and Wells Fargo Bank,
major owner of Household  International  and Household Bank.  The
former O.J.-owned businesses reportedly  dope  dealing  with  the
help  of  Nicole reportedly used these banks to launder the loot.
Bank of America and  Wells  Fargo are principally owned reputedly
by the Yakuza.)
 
(Note:  Starting on August 18, 1996, was a series in the San Jose
Mercury News about  the  CIA  causing  the  flood  of  dope  into
California.   How  does  that series of stories relate to the DEA
and the foregoing story about  O.J. Simpson?  Is there an overlap
between the CIA, the California  dope  gangs,  the  Herrera  dope
gangs, and the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza?)
