CN OPERATION POLICY CHANGES
===========================
 
With the huge  amount  of  information flowing through Conspiracy
Nation (CN) daily, I am forced to make some changes in operation.
 
1) I ask that info that you wish forwarded via the  mailing  list
be  limited  to  a  1  or 2 paragraph press release.  Please just
summarize whatever your information is and  include  if  possible
whatever  web page it is available at (or an e-mail address where
you can be  contacted).   That  way  those  who are interested in
further details can read further if they wish.
    This  change  in  policy  is necessary because I am having to
read through the various messages I  get and make a decision if I
should pass it along.  When I am receiving many 10-page  articles
it becomes impossible for me to read through every one and decide
if  it's  worth  passing  along.   So  please, just write a short
summary of what  it's  about  with  a  web  address and/or e-mail
address for those who are interested.
    I realize that I am a fallible human and that what  I  decide
is worth passing along is subject to error, but I do what I can.
 
2) Press releases I send out will all bear the subject heading of
"CN Press Release".  That way, those wishing  only  to  read  the
Conspiracy  Nation articles can easily skip the rest, should they
wish to.  Conspiracy Nation articles  will  go out as usual, with
subject heading of "Conspiracy Nation Vol. xx Num. xx".
 
3) I have added many links to conspiracy related web sites at the
Conspiracy Nation web site:
            http://www.shout.net/~bigred/cn.html
under the category  "other  sites."   Should  you  wish your site
included there, let me know. If I forget, keep pestering me.
 
I believe the new policy changes are a reasonable way  to  handle
the  increasing  volume of conspiracy related material being made
available.  The new  policy  will  better  utilize  the mail list
facilities than the current policy which I suspect is overloading
people with information. (At least I am getting overloaded.)
 
The explosion of conspiracy related information is, I believe,  a
good   thing.    Right   under   the   noses   of  the  so-called
"intelligentsia" a  tremendous  paradigm  upheaval  is occurring.
One or two timid academicians are even getting "daring" enough to
take a look at the phenomena and offer a course  or  two  on  the
subject.   (But  can  the  state-certified  intellectuals take an
honest look at conspiracy "theory?")
 
Incidentally, I welcome  conspiracy-related  items from all sides
of the political spectrum, so-called "left"  and  "right."   Just
please have mercy on the poor editor and limit your proposed press
releases to a paragraph or  two summarizing the information, with
the address of the web site where more details can be  found  (or
your e-mail address).
 
Thank you, from Conspiracy Nation!
