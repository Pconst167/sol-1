$50 million:  From Illinois,  to  Arkansas, to the Cayman Islands
-- Joseph Andreuccetti, an Illinois caulking contractor, gets put
into  involuntary   bankruptcy.    Supposedly   he  has  borrowed
$900,000, but really he never saw one  dime  of  the  money.   So
where  did the money go?  Allegedly it, included in a $50 million
Resolution  Trust  Corporation  contingency  fund,  got  sent  to
Arkansas to  cover  up  an  embezzlement  from  Madison  Guaranty
Savings and Loan.  I have spoke and met with Andreuccetti several
times  and  believe that he was indeed robbed and that the courts
are giving him the runaround in several cases he has subsequently
brought forward.
   Next, Congressman Dan Burton (R., Ind.) goes on-record about a
$50 million transfer of Arkansas  Development  Finance  Authority
(ADFA) money to the Cayman Islands.  Burton wonders aloud, Why on
earth  did  ADFA money, meant to benefit Arkansas small business,
get sent to the Cayman Islands? Says Burton on May 29, 1996:
 
  ADFA [Arkansas Development  Finance  Authority] was created
  by Governor Clinton in 1985 to provide economic development
  loans in Arkansas.  In December of 1988, ADFA deposited $50
  million in a Japanese bank in the Cayman Islands.  I have a
  copy of the contract that I will enter into the record.   I
  have  also  delivered  a  copy  of  this  document  to  the
  Independent   Counsel's  office.   Why  would  an  economic
  development agency in  Arkansas  deposit  $50  million in a
  bank in the Cayman  Islands?   The  Cayman  Islands  are  a
  well-known center of money  laundering  for  drug  dealers.
  The  State  Department's  international  narcotics  control
  report  described  the  Caymans   as  "a  haven  for  money
  laundering."
 
  One of the questions that I think is very,  very  important
  is why did the  Arkansas  Development  Financial  Authority
  send $50 million of Arkansas money to the Cayman Islands to
  deposit in a bank in  the  Cayman Islands, which is a major
  drug transit point acknowledged  by  almost every DEA agent
  in   the  world?   I  have  the  electronic  bank  transfer
  statements in my office.   I  am  going  to put them in the
  Congressional Record.   There  is  no  doubt  the money was
  wired  to  the  Cayman  Islands.   The question needs to be
  asked, why  was  it  wired?   Why  would  the  Governor  of
  Arkansas  allow  that?    (Congressional  Record,  5/29/96,
  H5627-28.)
 
Later in 1996, Sherman Skolnick and Joseph Andreuccetti file suit
against,  among  others,  First   Lady  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton,
charging that plaintiffs obstructed disclosure
 
  of the secret  details  of  the  unlawful  transfer of a 50
  million dollar portion of 58.4 million dollars of funds  of
  the Federal Home Loan Bank, parked and held in custody, and
  supposed  to  be  so,  with  Household  Bank  and Household
  International in the Chicago area,  and supposed to be held
  to make good the claims of plaintiff Andreuccetti.
 
  ...the  use  of said 50 million dollar unlawful transfer by
  defendant Hillary Rodham Clinton was to cover up 47 million
  dollars  that  was  misappropriated  and  embezzled, and/or
  otherwise unlawfully encumbered, used, or removed  from  an
  Arkansas  savings  and  loan,  Madison Guaranty Savings and
  Loan, as to which defendant  Hillary Rodham Clinton and her
  husband, William Jefferson Clinton, committed or caused  to
  be  committed,  and  allowed,  permitted, and condoned, and
  acquiesced in, acts and  doings punishable under provisions
  of the federal criminal code.
  
Responding   to  Skolnick  and  Andreuccetti's  lawsuit,  lawyers
representing Hillary Rodham Clinton stated that
 
  Plaintiff's complaint fails  to  meet the minimum standards
  of intelligibility and brevity...  The  complaint  is  both
  frivolous  and  abusive  and  is  yet  another  example  of
  plaintiffs'  misuse  of the judicial process.  Accordingly,
  the complaint against Mrs. Clinton should be dismissed with
  prejudice.
 
  [The plaintiffs'  complaint  is]  a  convoluted and lengthy
  collection of allegations that are either unintelligible or
  irrelevant.  To take but one example, in paragraph 30 (part
  of a four-and-a-half page narration of a purported  meeting
  with  an  IRS  agent),  plaintiffs  appear to allege that a
  United  States  bankruptcy  trustee  is  corrupt,  that the
  "nephew/godson" of a bishop embezzled $900,000, that one of
  the plaintiffs has been put into involuntary bankruptcy  as
  a  result of fraud, that a bank involved in that bankruptcy
  was  run  by  someone  who  used  to  be  the  head  of the
  "mafia-dominated Vatican Bank," and that the United  States
  Attorney's   Office  in  Chicago  is  yet  another  corrupt
  institution.  Even  after  partially  untangling this dense
  web of accusations, the relationship of the allegations  to
  any  cause  of  action  that  might  reasonably  be brought
  against the  defendant  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  remains a
  complete mystery.
 
Representing  Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  and  authors of the above
excerpts from "Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of
Defendant Hillary Rodham Clinton's  Motion  to Dismiss" are David
E. Kendall, Nicole K. Seligman, Max Stier, and  also  Michael  R.
Feagley and Walter M. Rogers of the firm Mayer, Brown & Platt.
 
Confused?  Or  perhaps  cherubic  Lady  Clinton's  face makes you
think, "Naw, not Hillary.  She wouldn't  be  connected  with  any
embezzlement."   Then  consider  the  following statement by Lisa
Schiffren, as  reported  in  the  February  1997  issue of George
magazine:
 
  A  better  financial  journalist  than  me  would  be  well
  employed finding out where the Clintons have stashed  their
  money  offshore.   I  would  imagine  there are hundreds of
  thousands of  dollars  sitting  in  the  Cayman Islands.  I
  really believe this.  If I had a lot of  time  and  someone
  was  willing to pay me a lot of money, I'd go find it.  The
  $100,000 [which Hillary Rodham  Clinton  made in the cattle
  futures market], courtesy of Tyson Foods, is the tip of the
  iceberg.  I'm giving them credit for having been bought for
  more than a measly hundred grand.

Charles  "Chuck"  Hayes  Convicted -- Ex-CIA agent Chuck Hayes is
fed  up  with  corrupt  government.   He  gets  a  powerful  Cray
computer, loads it into a semi-trailer, then he and his Merry Men
roam the nation,  hacking  into  secret  Swiss  bank accounts and
putting the fear of God into American politicians.   The  corrupt
politicos and their bureaucratic minions strike back.  Presumably
they   have  questionable  quantity  Lawrence  Myers,  journalist
*extraordinaire*, lie to the  FBI  that  Hayes  is shopping for a
"wet boy" (hit man).  FBI has one of their agents,  reportedly  a
former member of the Outlaws motorcycle gang, phone Hayes.  Hayes
apparently  knows  full  well  he  is  talking to an FBI man, but
decides to play along.  The FBI man  says he can do the "job" for
$5,000, and supposedly Hayes contracts with  him  to  murder  his
son.  Gotcha!  FBI arrests Hayes, and Hayes stands trial.  A jury
convicts Hayes and he now faces as much as 10 years in prison. 
   Present  during  the  Hayes  trial was "Limpiar Phebi Dojocia"
(pseudonym).  I spoke  with  "Limpiar"  on  the  phone today, and
here's what I got:
   ** The jury was 8 to 4, with  four  of  its  members  favoring
acquittal.   That  got  narrowed  down to one, then none, and the
jury returned a guilty verdict.
   ** The prosecution did a  last minute, dramatic unveiling of a
Federal Express  envelope,  giving  the  impression  it  was "hot
stuff, just  in."   The  envelope,  from  the  CIA,  contained  a
response  to  inquiries.   Says CIA:  "Chuck Hayes?  Chuck Hayes?
Nope, never heard of him."   But, says "Limpiar," the envelope in
fact must have arrived on or about January 15, making the January
29th  "dramatic  unveiling"  misleading.   An  added  prosecution
benefit of this "last minute" routine is that  defense  discovery
guidelines  get  bypassed;  how  can  prosecution have shared the
letter with defense when they themselves "just now got it."
   ** Why didn't  defense  attorney  Gatewood Galbraith call Bill
Hamilton, of Inslaw, as a witness?  Hamilton could have  verified
that  Hayes was indeed a former CIA employee.  "Limpiar" tells me
that Hamilton was willing to testify.  Much of the case hinged on
whether or not Hayes really  was  a former CIA agent.  Apparently
the only one called by Galbraith to  corroborate  the  claim  was
James Norman, former senior editor with Forbes magazine.

Re-arranging Deck Chairs on  the  Titanic -- Commenting on recent
revelations regarding FBI crime lab bungling and  worse,  Stephen
Jones,  attorney  for  accused  OKC bombing(s) mastermind Timothy
McVeigh, stated that it was "like re-arranging deck chairs on the
Titanic."   Jones  thinks  that  the  government's  case  against
McVeigh is  hopeless,  and,  seemingly,  the  recent  revelations
amount  to  nothing  toward  altering   the   futility   of   the
government's case. 
   So what is going on? Why the revelations?
   Recall how, not  long  after  the  April  19, 1995 bombing(s),
Colonel (Retired) James "Bo" Gritz and others were  referring  to
McVeigh  as  "Lee  Harvey  McVeigh."  This was an allusion to Lee
Harvey  Oswald,  accused  lone  assassin  of  President  John  F.
Kennedy.  Paraded into the  angry Oklahoma sunshine shortly after
the bombing of the Murrah Building, clad in a bright orange  "see
me"  jumpsuit,  it  appeared  as  if  *someone*  might  save  the
prosecution  some work by murdering McVeigh, a la Jack Ruby doing
the same to Oswald.  Were the government and/or its agents hoping
that might happen, that  McVeigh  would magically be removed from
the equation?
   Unfortunately for those desiring the removal  of  McVeigh  and
consequent  absence  of  a  trial  in the matter, McVeigh was not
assassinated and  the  trial  is  at  last  imminent.   McVeigh's
attorney  Stephen  Jones  seems  to be no slouch, and with closed
circuit television to be made available to interested  survivors,
family  members,  and  apparently  to an alert underground press,
Jones *will*  be  heard.   And  he  will  be  heard *without* the
"helpful" little interpolations of corporate "news" media.   This
spells  trouble  for  any working to cover up the truth about the
Oklahoma City bombing(s).   By  now  they  must  be wishing, more
fervently than ever, that McVeigh could somehow just disappear.
   With that as background, consider how convenient it  would  be
for  the  case  against  McVeigh to be thrown out, due to tainted
evidence.  Recent revelations about  FBI crime lab misdoings come
at an opportune time for any who are wishing  that  the  upcoming
trial  would just go away.  And, FBI could just sit back and say,
"Well, we *know*  that  McVeigh  did  it.   It's  just that picky
legalities thwarted justice."
