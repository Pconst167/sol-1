Allegations of Planned "Hit" on Terry Reed Corroborated
-------------------------------------------------------
    In the current  book,  *Boy  Clinton*,  by R. Emmett Tyrrell,
Jr., mention is made  of  how  then-Arkansas  State  Trooper  and
Clinton  protege L.D. Brown was being brought into the CIA.  With
help  from  then-Governor  Bill   Clinton,  Brown  was  gradually
introduced into CIA covert operations.
    Those familiar with legendary CIA figures will recognize  the
name Felix Rodriguez, a.k.a.  "Max Gomez."  According to Tyrrell,
Clinton  was  in  contact  with  Rodriguez  and knew him at least
fairly well.
    Brown began  to  have  misgivings  about  a  CIA career after
flying with the infamous  Barry  Seal  to  Central  America.   He
discovered  that  cocaine  was  being  brought back on the return
flight.  Upset by the discovery,  he nonetheless was persuaded to
embark on a new operation, urged on in part by Rodriguez.
    Brown was sent to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to  carry  out  an
assassination plan.  He flew there on June 18, 1986 and there was
given  an  "FN Light Automatic Rifle," commonly referred to as an
"F.A.L."
    Brown went to the Hotel  Playa  Conchas Chinas on the morning
of June 21st.  But when his prospective target was pointed out to
him, Brown had a change of  heart  and  did  not  carry  out  the
assignment.
    According  to  Tyrrell's book, Brown's prospective victim was
none other than Terry Reed, co-author, with John Cummings, of the
best-selling book, *Compromised*.
    My  thanks  to   Mr.   Cummings   for   pointing  out  to  me
corroboration for Tyrrell's and Brown's allegations which can  be
found  in  the aforementioned book, *Compromised*, in the chapter
entitled "Escape from  Freedom."   Therein  the  reader will find
that Reed was indeed in Puerto Vallarta on June 21, 1986 where he
had a pre-arranged meeting with a  shady  character  named  Mitch
Marr.   It  appears that Marr, either knowingly or not, was there
to help set up target Reed  for L.D. Brown.  Marr helped position
Reed at an oceanside bar and, with endless talk, kept  him  there
that morning.
    Marr   was   to   have  met  Reed  again  that  evening,  but
suspiciously did not keep  the  engagement.   Marr met again with
Reed the next morning.

Don't Mess With Bill
--------------------
    Patricia Mendoza, arrested for "disorderly conduct" when  she
dared to shout at Bill Clinton, "You suck," describes herself and
her  husband  as  boring people.  "We own a station wagon.  We're
very boring people," she reportedly says.
    But since she  dared  to  "diss"  Brother  Bill, she has been
locked up for 14 hours, subpoenaed by the  SS  (Secret  Service),
and  has  received  a  letter  from  the  IRS  saying  basically,
according   to  the  Washington  Times  National  Weekly  Edition
(9/8/96), "We're going to take your house."
    She is said to be frightened  that her children will be taken
away from her.  "I didn't let my kids out of my sight for a month
and a half," she is quoted as saying.  "I thought they were going
to take my kids."
    What's next?  Will Lord Clinton  declare  her  hometown,  the
Chicago suburb of Westchester, a "no-fly zone?"

United Nations Drug Smugglers
-----------------------------
    According   to   The   Spotlight  (9/9/96),  "Bosnian  police
officials and  U.S.  officers  in  the  U.N.  mission have linked
senior  U.N.  police  force  officials  in  Bosnia  with  corrupt
practices including drug smuggling."

Mexico To Explode By December 1st?
----------------------------------
    Lyndon LaRouche blames International Monetary  Fund  policies
for  "mass  murder"  which  "could  have  the whole hemisphere in
flames within the next  two  months."   He  warns that "Mexico is
going to blow up before December 1st."
    According to Gretchen Small, writing in *The New  Federalist*
("Mexico  Could  Blow  Up  by  Dec.  1,"  9/2/96),  Mexico  faces
"imminent physical and economic disintegration."  She claims that
"Foreign-run narcoterrorist armies, masquerading as 'defenders of
the poor and the Indians,' are proliferating."

Justice Department Boosts Prison Labor
--------------------------------------
    Also in the same issue of *The New Federalist*: 
    "In  a  new  publication  titled,  'Work in American Prisons:
Joint Ventures with the  Private  Sector,' the U.S. Department of
Justice issued a blanket endorsement and  promotion  of  'private
sector'  firms  opening up industry in America's booming prisons.
The 15-page pamphlet reads like a glossy promotional, encouraging
companies  to  use  prison  labor  because  'inmates  represent a
readily available and dependable source of entry-level labor that
is a cost-effective alternative to work forces found  in  Mexico,
the   Caribbean  Basin,  Southeast  Asia,  and  the  Pacific  Rim
countries.'"
