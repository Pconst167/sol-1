JESSE JAMES WAS ONE OF HIS NAMES -- II
======================================

Great Britain, frustrated in her colonial designs upon the United
States, after the War of 1812 ceased her machinations for awhile.
She was occupied elsewhere, for  example  in the Crimean War. But
by about 1856, the eyes of the British imperialists  turned  once
more toward America.  "A close business relationship had grown up
between the cotton-growing aristocracy of the southern states and
cotton  manufacturing  England,  and  the  southern  states  were
swarming  with  British agents."  (*The Empire of "The City"*, by
E.C. Knuth) Stirred up by  these  British agents, the South chose
to secede from the united States.

And why *couldn't* the southern states secede?  They  had  joined
into  the Union voluntarily, so why couldn't they later choose to
withdraw from that union?  The south wanted a divorce, and it had
never promised "until  death  do  us  part."   An article sent to
Conspiracy  Nation  by  a  reader  ("How  Lincoln  Destroyed  the
Jeffersonian Ideal,"  by  Thomas  J.  DiLorenzo)  asks  the  same
question.   Secession  "was  the  very  principle  upon which the
American  Revolution  was   based."   During  Thomas  Jefferson's
presidency, New England  Federalists,  upset  at  rule  from  the
agrarian  Virginian,  Jefferson,  plotted  secession  themselves.
"During  this  time  there was no debate among the New Englanders
over  the  *right*  of  secession,  only  over  its  wisdom  as a
political strategy." (DiLorenzo)

Why was Abraham Lincoln so fixated on preserving the  Union?   We
are told in "history" books that he felt strongly that "the Union
must be preserved."  But *why* must it?  Apparently Lincoln never
explained  the "why" of it.  Two possible "whys" are (1) a strong
Union  deters  European designs on North America, and (2) Lincoln
was  the  servant  of  East  Coast  capitalists,  with  their own
imperialist designs on the continent.  Perhaps  the  two  reasons
suggested are not mutually exclusive.

As his "reward" for helping save the Union for the greater wealth
and glory of East  Coast  capitalists, these same capitalists had
Lincoln murdered when he threatened to get in the  way  of  their
plan to rape the South via "Reconstruction."

During the Civil War, with U.S. energies concentrated within, the
European imperialists tipped their  hand.   "In December, 1861, a
large British, French and Spanish expeditionary force was  landed
at  Vera  Cruz  [Mexico]  in  defiance  of  the Monroe Doctrine."
(Knuth) The  Archduke  Maximilian  of  Austria  was  installed as
Emperor of Mexico.

The American  Civil  War  "officially"  ended  at  about the time
General Robert Lee surrendered at Appomattox in  April  of  1865,
but according to Del Schrader (*Jesse James Was One Of His Names*
by  Del  Schrader,  with  Jesse  James III.  Arcadia, California:
Santa  Anita  Press,  1975.   Library  of  Congress  Catalog Card
Number:  74-33962),  Nashville,  Tennessee  continued  on  as the
underground capital of the Confederacy for *nineteen* more years.
And as for the secret society known as "The Knights of the Golden
Circle" (see CN 11.35), it did not apparently disband until 1916.

After  Lee's  surrender, a force of 2,000 Missouri cavalry and "a
full regiment  of  Confederate-led  Red  Bone  Indians  from East
Texas," led by General J.O. Shelby, headed  south,  into  Mexico.
(Schrader)  They  naturally  went  to  join  with their ally, the
European puppet Emperor Maximilian.  This force became threatened
by Mexican patriots, followers of  Benito Juarez.  Sent to rescue
Shelby's troops,  says  Schrader,  was  an  elite  force  led  by
Colonels Quantrill and Jesse James.

While in Mexico, Jesse James reportedly was introduced to Emperor
Maximilian.  James was enlisted  to  help  the dictator smuggle a
huge treasure out of  his  tottering  empire.   Included  in  the
treasure  were  jewels  and  heirlooms  of the House of Hapsburg,
Aztec  gold  hidden,  long  ago,  from  the  *Conquistadores*  by
servants of Montezuma, and a great quantity of other gold on loan
to the emperor from the House of Rothschild.

James and his band began moving the treasure northward.   Shortly
thereafter, they learned that Emperor Maximilian had *apparently*
been  executed  by  Juarez's  patriots.   But  the  emperor, says
Schrader, had *not* been  killed.   Shot,  with others, by firing
squad, the bodies were loaded onto  carts  and  hauled  away  for
burial.   At  the  gravesites,  a  group  of Red Bone indians had
infiltrated the burial ceremony.  When they noticed signs of life
in the emperor, the  indians  finagled the Mexicans into allowing
them to give the "dead" dictator a separate  burial.   Maximilian
was  nursed back to health, and made his way to East Texas, where
he was met by Jesse James.

Grateful for the help James had given him, Maximilian gave him $5
million in gold.  The  Knights  of  the Golden Circle received an
additional contribution of $12.5 million, says Schrader.

Reportedly, Jesse James persuaded Maximilian to change  his  name
to  John  Maxi  and  live  undercover  in  America.   James  also
reportedly  went  to  Europe,  found a look-alike of Maximilian's
wife, Charlotta, and then smuggled the real Charlotta back to the
U.S. There, she became re-united with her husband.  Now buried in
Maximilian's grave in Vienna,  says  Schrader, is a German seaman
who had died in a gunfight in Vera Cruz.  "Switching bodies is  a
subterfuge as old as mankind, and the Golden Circle certainly had
no monopoly on this practice." (Schrader)
