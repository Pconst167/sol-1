                                Chronology

          This report on Nikola Tesla is in two parts. The first covers Tesla's
        life and some of his important accomplishments and milestones. The
        second part covers various construction articles for his Tesla coils
        and the Tesla turbine.

        1856 He was born in Smiljan, Croatia

        1857-60 As a boy Tesla played with wood disks turned by water in a
                stream. This led him to later develop the Tesla turbine.

        1875    Started studying electrical engineering at Gratz Polytechnic.

        1880    Finished studies at the University of Prague.

        1882-83 Made his first AC motor while working for a telephone company
                in France. Tried to get various backers in Europe for his ideas
                without any success.

        1884 Nikola Tesla decided to come to America.

        1885-87  Worked for Thomas Edison.

        1887-88 Patented AC motor and distribution system. Then sold the
                rights to George Westinghouse.

        1889-90 Worked with Westinghouse to further develop many sizes of AC
                motors and dynamotors. At this time he built his first
                Tesla coil to transmit power.

        1893 Lit up the Columbian Exposition and gave many demonstrations on
             electricity ideas such as lighting tubes without any wire con-
             nections. The first radio diagram was done during this time.

        1895-96 Fulfilled a dream with Westinghouse of harnessing Niagara Falls
                to provide electrical power and transmitted it 22 miles, thus
                creating the electrical distribution industry we use today.

        1898 In Madison Square Garden demonstrated the use of radio to control
             a boat remotely starting, steering and turning on and off the
             lighting on the boat.

        1899-1900 Established a laboratory in Colorado Springs to develop
                  transmission of power using his coil design. Created 
                  lightning bolts 22 feet long. This research was support-
                  ed by Col. John Jacob Astor.

        1901-16 Built the Wydencliff Tower to transmit various radio programs
                around the world, thus anticipating modern use of radio. This
                project was never completed because he went broke. In 1902
                Tesla patented a four circuit tuner.

        1921-28 Received patents on a VTOL aircraft which was never built.

        1930-40 During these years due to financial constraints became a 
                recluse. Wrote some articles and anticipated many uses of
                radio, facsimile, radar, & television.

        1943 Died on January 7  at age 86 in a New York hotel room.

           There is very little information on the net on Nikola Tesla's life
        and the many areas to which he contributed.
           He was a very talented individual who opened many doors and
        anticipated many uses of power, radio and energy.

             Construction Articles on Tesla Coils & Turbines

                 Through the years many articles have been written on constructing
        Tesla coils, and a few on the Tesla turbine. Some of these are listed
        below, followed by some current books and sources on the internet.
        Sources can be found on microfish in most libraries. The best sources
        are Popular Science and Popular Mechanics. Popular Electronics and 
        Radio Eletronics will be more difficult to retrieve.

            Some possible transistors

        The transistors used to drive the horizontal flyback transformer
        have a high cbo and ceo rating. I've included two replacement
        source catalogue numbers.
