 H.R. 3515 -- Transcribed by James D. Bryant II on Nov. 24, 1991
              I have proofed this twice, it should not contain any
              errors or omissions, I can't access my spell checker
              right now, there may be a typo or two somewhere..

Please note that this is not the article written by James Bryant.  I
wrote my own notice here, because I strongly disagree with his
viewpoint on this bill.  His article may be file requested from
1:1/1 @fidonet as "ta91.zip".


The following document is a full transcription of the
Telecommunications Act of 1991.


IF THIS BILL PASSES, IT WILL GIVE THE BELL OPERATING COMPANIES
AND OTHER PHONE SERVICE CARRIERS THE FREEDOM TO CHARGE BBS
OPERATORS WHATEVER RATES THEY SEE FIT.

Please write your congressmen, expressing your opposition to this
bill!  Be sure to mention the following points:

1.  BBSs are not-for-profit.

2.  BBSs are not typically used as heavily as larger, for-profit
    information services.

3.  BBS operators do not typically charge money for use of the
    system.

4.  The section of the proposed bill which concerns us is (quote
    this exactly):

       section 201A(e) of this bill's proposed ammendment to the
       Communications Act of 1934

5.  In the state of Texas, Southwestern Bell Telephone attempted
    to charge business rates to all BBSs, and the Texas Public
    Utilities Commission unanimously agreed that this was
    unfair.  In your letter, refer to Texas PUC docket 8387,
    Reginald A. Hirsch, et. al. vs Southwestern Bell Telephone
    Company.  Partial text of their resolution may be requested
    for inclusion in your letter, from 1:280/77 @fidonet as
    "TX-8387.ZIP".


Please TELL your Congressman and Senators, and all members of the
involved committees to vote >> NO << on this bill, unless it is
ammended to guarantee residential phone rates to not-for-profit,
free BBSs.

The basic principle of this bill is a good one; it is intended to
prevent the Bell companies from monopolizing the information
services.  Please do not say anything in your letter which could
be interpreted as opposition to that basic principle.

                               H.R. 3515

To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to encourage competition in the
provision of electronic information services, to foster the continued
diversity of information sources and services, to preserve the universal
availability of basic telecommunications services, and for other
purposes.

----------------------------------------------------------

                 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                         October 8, 1991

Mr. Cooper (for himself, Mr. Bliley, Mr. Synar, Mr. Schaefer, and Mr.
Bryant) introduced the following bill, which was referred jointly to the
Committees on Energy and Commerce and the Judiciary.

----------------------------------------------------------

                              A BILL

To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to encourage competition in the
provision of electronic information services, to foster the continued
diversity of information sources and services, to preserve the universal
availability of basic telecommunications services, and for other
purposes.


1        Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representa-
2 tives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

3 SECTION 1.  SHORT TITLE

4        This Act may be cited as the "Telecommunications
5 Act of 1991".


H.R. 3515      102nd Congress, 1st Session     [Page 02 of 35]

 1 SECTION 2.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSES

 2     (a) Findings--The Congress finds that--

 3              (1) the national welfare will be enhanced by the
 4     continued development of robust competition in the
 5     provision of electronic information services and tele-
 6     communications services;

 7              (2) the widest possible availability of informa-
 8     tion and telecommunications services requires an
 9     open telecommunications infrastructure that incor-
 10     porates market-driven advances in technology and
 11     whose features and functions are available on a non-
 12     discriminatory and unbundled basis;

 13              (3) the availability of multiple and inter-
 14     connected complementary telecommunications net-
 15     works can enhance competition in the provision of
 16     information and telecommunications services;

 17              (4) the redundancy inherent in a pluralistic
 18     telecommunications infrastructure offers protection
 19     against network failures;

 20              (5) the cost-effective deployment of advanced
 21     public telecommunicatins networks, subject to ap-
 22     propriate safeguards, can further the long-standing
 23     goals of universal telephone service at affordable
 24     rates;

 25              (6) the provision of information services by di-
 26     vested operating companies prior to the development of


H.R. 3515      102nd Congress, 1st Session     [Page 03 of 35]

 1     an effectively competitive telecommunications infra-
 2     structure would likely lead to higher rates for tele-
 3     phone exchange service and jepordize the diversity
 4     of information sources and services; and

 5              (7) current regulatory policies must be revised
 6     and supplemented to ensure the universal availability
 7     of telephone exchange service at reasonable rates
 8     and fair competition in delivery of telecommunicati-
 9     cations and information services.

 10     (b) PURPOSES--The purposes of this Act are to--

 11              (1) ensure the continued availability of afford-
 12     able telecommunications and information services
 13     that are essential to full participation in the nation's
 14     economic, political, and social life;

 15              (2) encourage the continued development of ad-
 16     vanced, reliable telecommunications networks;

 17              (3) ensure that the costs of such networks and
 18     the services provided over them are allocated equi-
 19     tably among users; and

 20              (4) ensure that the provision of information
 21     services by divested operating companies does not
 22     jepordize the universal availability of telephone ex-
 23     change service at reasonable rates or undermine
 24     competition in the information services marketplace.

 2                       DEVELOPMENT

 3 Sec. 101.  NETWORK STANDARDS

 4        Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is
 5 amended by inserting after section 201 the following new
 6 section:

 7 "Sec. 201A. NETWORK STANDARDS.

 8     "(a) SERVICE QUALITY --

 9              "(1) ADOPTION OF STANDARDS.-- A Federal-
 10     State Joint Board shall be established under section
 11     401(c) not later than 90 days after the enactment
 12     of this subsection to impose and enforce network
 13     quality standards upon the common carriers for the
 14     purpose of ensuring the combined maintenance and
 15     evolution of common carrier facilities and services.
 16     Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment
 17     of this subsection, the Joint Board shall initiate a
 18     rulemaking proceeding to establish standards, to be
 19     enforced by the Commission and the State Commis-
 20     sions as to matters within their respective jurisdic-
 21     tions, for measuring common carrier network qual-
 22     ity.

 23              "(2) REPORTS -- Each common carrier shall
 24     submit to the Joint Board established pursuant to
 25     paragraph (1) a quarterly data report, in a form re-


H.R. 3515      102nd Congress, 1st Session     [Page 05 of 35]

1     quired by the Joint Board, reguarding compliance
2     with the prescribed network quality standards.  The
3     Joint Board may require periodic independant audits
4     of common carrier compliance with the network
5     quality standards.  The Commission, upon the rec-
6     commendation of the Joint Board, shall establish en-
7     forcement penalties and procedures, including expe-
8     dited customer complaint mechanisms, to ensure
9     common carrier compliance with network quality
10     standards.

11     "(b) INTERCONNECTION --

12              "(1) GENERALLY-- Each local exchange carrier
13     shall provide interconnection, on a reasonable and
14     nondiscriminatory basis, to common carriers and
15     other providers of telecommunications services and
16     information services who request it.  An interconnect-
17     ing party may physically colocate the equipment nec-
18     essary for interconnection at the premises of a local
19     exchange carrier, except as provided under para-
20     graph (2).

21              "(2) VIRTUAL COLOCATION-- A local exchange
22     carrier that can demonstrate by clear and convincing
23     evidence in a particular case that the physical
24     colocation required under paragraph (1) is not pract-
25     ticable for technical reasons or because of space lim-


H.R. 3515      102nd Congress, 1st Session     [Page 06 of 35]

 1     itations shall offer an interconnecting party virtual
 2     colocation with it's premises.  Virtual colocation shall
 3     be economically and technically comparable to inter-
 4     connection that is or would be obtained through
 5     physical colocation of the interconnecting party's
 6     equipment at the premises of the local exchange car-
 7     ier.  Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve a di-
 8     vested operating company of it's obligations under
 9     section 227(d)(12).

10              "(3) EXCEPTION FOR RURAL EXCHANGE CAR-
11     RIERS.-- Notwithstanding any other provision of this
12     subsection, a rural exchange carrier shall not be re-
13     quired to provide interconnection to another local ex-
14     change carrier.

15              "(4) REGUALTIONS-- Within 270 days after the
16     date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of
17     1991, the Commission shall--

18                 "(A) adopt and make effective rules to en-
19          force the oblications imposed by this subsection;
20          and

21                 "(B) initiate a rulemaking to require that
22          the interconnection offered by a local exchange
23          carrier pursuant to this subsection shall provide
24          for the portability of telephone numbers.

25     "(c) NETWORK ACCESS--

 5     shall prepare and file tariffs in accordance with this

 7     access services required under this section.  The costs
 8     that a local exchange carrier incurs in providing
 9     such services shall be borne solely by the users of
10     the features and functions comprising such services.
11     The Commission shall review such tariffs to ensure
12     that--

13                 "(A) the charges for such services are cost-
14          based; and

23     tween the proposed charges and the cost of provid-
24     ing such services.  The submission of such informa-
25     tion shall be pursuant to the rules adopted by the Com-


H.R. 3515      102nd Congress, 1st Session     [Page 10 of 35]

 1     mission to ensure that similarly situated carriers
 2     provide such information in an uniform fashion.

 3              "(3) UNIVERSAL SERVICE ELEMENTS-- A local
 4     exchange carrier may include in it's tariffs for inter-
 5     connection services an element intended to recover
 6     the amount necessary to preclude any substantial in-
 7     creases in the rates for telephone exchange service
 8     that would otherwise result from the offering of
 9     interconnection services.  Such element shall be im-
10     posed at a uniform rate on any person who pur-
11     chases such services, and shall also be included at
12     the same rate in such carrier's charges for services
13     offered by the carrier in competition with the serv-
14     ices offered by interconnecting parties.  No later than

21     costs of providing telephone exchange servicce.

22     "(f) RESALE--  The resale of telephone exchange
23 service (or the unbundled elements of such service) in conjunc-
24 tion with the the furnishing of an interstate telecommuni-
25 cations service or any information service shall not be pro-

 1 hibited or subject to unreasonable conditions by the Com-
 2 mission, any State, or any local exchange carrier.

 3     "(g) COORDINATED PLANNING--  The Commission
 4 shall adopt and make effective rules for the conduct of
 5 coordinated network planning by common carriers, subject
 6 to Commission supervision, to ensure (1) the effective and
 7 efficient interconnection and interoperability of common
 8 carrier networks, and (2) that the design of such networks
 9 does not impede access to information services by sub-
10 scribers to telephone exchange service furnished by a rural
11 exchange carrier.

12     "(h) STUDY-- No later than 270 days after the en-
13 actment of the Telecommunications Act of 1991, the Com-
14 mission shall initiate an inquiry to examine the effects of
15 competition in the provision of telephone exchange access
16 and telephone exchange service on the availability and
17 rates for telephone exchange service furnished by rural ex-
18 change carriers.
