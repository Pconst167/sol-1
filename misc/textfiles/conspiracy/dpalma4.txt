       INTRODUCTION:

       It has been  hitherto  believed in physics that the  total  electric
       charge in the  Universe  is  a  constant quantity, and if additional
       charge appears in some region, it  is  only  at  the  expense of the
       charge deficit in some other regions.

       It is a basic law that electric charge is conserved  and  cannot  be
       destroyed or created.    Precise   experiments   on  a  Space  Power
       Generator (SPG) which has been now  further developed to demonstrate
       the commercial viability of the newly discovered phenomenon of space
       power generation however,  totally  violate  the   existing  law  of
       conservation of charge,  by  generating output electrical power much
       in excess of the input electrical power.

       Since electric charge  is  a  form  of  basic  energy,  the  law  of
       conservation of energy will need to be enlarged to incorporate in it
       the dynamics of  absolute  vacuum  [1]  which in a state of rotation
       generates fundamental field to produce electrical charge and energy.

       DESCRIPTION OF THE SPG:

       The SPG shown in Fig. 1 is a further  developed form of the machines
       described [2,3] in earlier issues of this magazine.

       A non-magnetic shaft interconnects two mild steel  rotors  on  which
       two electromagnets are  mounted.  Electric power at 1.5 volt d-c and
       high ampheres is drawn from each  unit,  with  the  help  of copper-
       graphite brushes when the machine runs at 2860 rpm  directly coupled
       and driven by an induction motor.

       The power is drawn between the inner rotor's cylindrical surface and
       the shaft through  d-c  shunts  that enable measurements of high d-c
       current.

       The SPG weighs about 150 Kg. and is  fabricated  out of 120 mm thick
       mild steel plate.  The two units enable generation  of power at more
       than 3 volt  d-c  by  appropriate series connections between the two
       coils.  The electromagnet's coils  are  16  swg super enamelled wire
       with 216 turns in each coil.

       The feature that  brings  improvements [4] in this  machine  is  the
       larger diameter of  the  rotors  that produces higher d-c voltage at
       comparatively lower speed, not exceeding  3000  rpm.   Also the twin
       units with single coil in each unit double the amount of power.

       TEST RESULTS:

       The drive motor  (DM)  takes  no-load current of 2.6  amperes  (1300
       watts) to rotate itself and the SPG to overcome windage and friction
       at 2870 rpm.   The no-load voltage internally generated in each unit
       of the SPG is adjusted to 1.5 volts  d-c  between  the shaft and the
       inner rotor by the control of the d-c excitation current  in the two
       electromagnet's coils connected in series.

       The excitation current  is  31  amperes, the total d-c resistance of
       the two coils being 2.5 ohms.  The power given to the electromagnets
       is 31 x  31  x  2.5,  that is, 2400  watts.   The  two  shunts  with
       calibration of 2000 amperes for 75 mv are now connected  across  the
       two output circuits.

       The d-c currents  measured  in each circuit are almost equal to 2613
       amperes corresponding to 98 mv reading of the shunt.

       The output electrical power of each  unit  is 2613 x 1.5 watts, that
       is, 3919 watts.  Total electrical power from the two  units  is 7839
       watts.

       As the SPG  is  electrically  loaded,  the current of DM rises to 10
       amperes, showing a rise of 7.4 amperes over the no-load current, and
       corresponding to a rise in input electrical power of 3700 watts.

       The load current  of  the DM of 10  amperes  amounts  to  the  total
       electrical input to the DM of 5000 watts, out of which 1300 watts is
       utilised to overcome the no-load losses.

       The remaining electrical input of 3700 watts generates 7839 watts of
       electrical output power,   giving  the  efficiency  of  space  power
       generation in this particular as 211.8%.

       Assuming electromagnetic efficiency of the DM as 80%, the efficiency
       of the electrical energy generation of the SPG will rise to 264.75%.

       If the excitation power of 2400 watts  given  to the SPG is deducted
       from the total  electrical output from the SPG of  7839  watts,  the
       balance electrical output  of  5439  watts  still  exceeds the total
       electrical input of 5000 watts by 439 watts, giving the total system
       efficiency of 105.9% while, in addition  the  DM-SPG  set  runs as a
       perpetual system drawing 1300 watts of power from space.

       QUANTUM OF SPACE POWER:

       The quantum of  electrical charge produced due to  the  rotation  of
       space in a rotating electromagnet and the electrical power produced
       when the power   is   withdrawn  through  an  electric  circuit,  as
       discussed in earlier article [2], is given by,

                            P = (1.8) LN(r^2)(10^-5)kW
                                        (1)

       where, P is power in kW, L is axial length of the SPG in centimeter,
       N is revolution per second, and 'r' is the radius in centimeter of
       the SPG on the inner rotor surface.

       The derivation of the above relation  was  based  on  the assumption
       that the radius of the spherical void at the centre of electron as
       discussed in space vortex theory [1,2] is 1.5 x (10^-11) cm.

       More precise measurements  in  space  power generation  experiments,
       however show that the coefficient 1.8 in equation (1) should be 2.5,
       and the void  radius  at electron's centre should be taken as 10^-11
       cm.  With these  corrections  the   space  power  equation  (1)  now
       becomes:

                            P = (2.5) LN(r^2)(10^-5)kW
                                        (2)

       substituting the values, L=12, N=47.6, and r=11.43 in (2),

                                    P = 5.85 kW

       Since there are two units of the SPG on the shaft, total power from
       the two units will be 11.7 kW, which is 1.5 times the output power
       drawn from the machine in the above test.

       With additional brushes and reduced contacts at about  3000 rpm, the
       above machine will have capacity to produce about 12 kW of power.

       If the SPG is driven at 6000 rpm both the voltages and currents will
       be doubled, producing 4 times output of 48 kW.  Since the excitation
       power remains constant,  much  higher  total  system  efficiency  is
       expected though the efficiency of  the  SPG  as computed above  will
       remain constant at 211.8%.


       CONCLUSION:

       Mass-energy equation of Einstein brought forth an universal law that
       an electron like  all  matter  contains  in its structure energy.  A
       further enlargement of this law is that electron is itself energy,
       where "energy" in physical terms is a state of vacuum in rotation.

       Even at ordinary speed of rotation  of  an electromagnet, the inter-
       atomic space of  the  iron core develops velocity fields  of  vacuum
       that qualitatively act  like  additional  charge within the rotating
       system and liberate orbital electrons of the iron atoms.

       With the interaction of the magnetic  field  the free electrons form
       polarites [2,3].

       It is possible to commercially develop a machine that can not only
       rotate itself perpetually but also generate additional electrical
       charge in kilowatts and higher range.

       The law of  conservation  of charge and the law of  conservation  of
       energy are applicable   within  the  systems  confined  to  material
       interactions alone and not to the medium of space which is a dynamic
       entity that can rotate and create charge at ordinary speeds, and can
       rotate and create electrons at speed of light.
