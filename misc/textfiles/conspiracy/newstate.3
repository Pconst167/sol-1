                         A Review of the

   Proposed Constitutional Model for the Newstates of America

                     By Col. Curtis B. Dall

                        Opening Comments

     This document was "hatched" in the Center for the Study of
Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, California, under the
direction of Rexford Tugwell, working with scores of
collaborators for about ten years.  It is largely the
distillation of a book written by him, entitled, "The Emerging
Constitution," published in 1974 by Harper and Row, for a small,
select group of readers.  It contains twelve Articles and is
offered as a substitute for our time-honored, magnificent
Constitution.  Tugwell's document would foist upon unalerted
Americans a new, deceitfully worded "Constitution" tooled up for
a Police State under a Dictator!

     Rex Tugwell, I can readily recall, was a well-known, Far-Out
Liberal of the New Deal Era, a friend of Nelson Rockefeller who,
reportedly, is also much interested in the promotion of this
subversive new "Constitutional Model" with its varied overtones
for a Dictatorship.

     Just why should any group of Americans take it upon
themselves to gratuitously present to the American people a NEW
Constitution to replace the one which as served the country so
outstandingly over the years?  Why attempt to tear down and
overthrow our form of government by setting up, in its place, a
Soviet-type, Godless Dictatorship, depriving the Individual
American of Free Enterprise and personal Liberty?  Evidently, it
is because a few super-rich men, devoid of loyalty to country,
expect, along with some of their Satellite Corporations, to
profit greatly by assisting in the development of a One-World,
Socialist State which they expect to control.

     Their subversive planning will ultimately fail, once loyal
Americans understand their monstrous plan.

     I have read Dr. Peter Beter's very penetrating, brilliant
analysis of this proposed new Constitution, which he wrote as an
aroused lawyer.  This review of mine will represent the point of
view of an aroused layman, emphasizing certain "key points" for
those who are unsuspecting, and, therefore, unalerted--those who
find it hard to believe that a few wealthy, politically-
perverted-minded individuals, and their well-kept stooges, would
stoop so low as to stick a knife in the back of their fellow-
Americans and attempt to destroy the fruits of 200 years of
struggle and great achievement here.  A struggle for the
advancement and well-being of Free Men, in our enlightened,
Constitutional Republic.

     This abortive "New Constitution" pretends to follow the
language of our own Constitution.  Lying just beneath some sweet-
sounding, misleading words, however, are potential Subversion,
Malfeasance, and perhaps, Treason.  Tugwell, the individual, and
all sponsors of this Plan should be tried by the Courts and
punished for their adjudged crimes against their country and
their fellow-citizens, and the charters of all sponsoring and
contributing Foundations voided.  For those who, with intent,
have arrogantly attempted to turn back the clock and aim to
plunge us all into miserable servitude, just what punishment is
adequate?

     These comments are made to provide a preface for my review,
which follows:

                            Preamble

     (a)  It welcomes the future "in good order."  Just what does
that really mean?

     (b)  "To create an adequate and self-repairing Government."
If our present Government needs some minor repairing, why not
carefully consider the matter for possible improvement?  Why even
consider a new form of Government that might be "self-
repairing"--by command coming from a Dictator?  Why change the
entire form of a highly successful Government for free people to
one controlled by iron-clad Dictatorship?

     Note.  "We, the people, do establish the Newstates of
America, herein provided to be ours--"  Well, what would we have
then?  What, in contrast to that which we have now?  Today, we
have a noble document, far, far removed from a "concensus for
Collectivism"--a dangerous phrase which we occasionally hear from
Internationally-influenced speakers in their efforts to further
the aims of the super-rich Corporate Socialists.  The emphasis in
the Preamble, and throughout, is to favor BIG Government and
down-grade The People.  This is the complete reverse of our own
Constitution.

                   Rights and Responsibilities

                           Article 1.

                          "A"  Rights.

     Section 1.  Note the "exception."  Who is to define "the
emergency?"

     Section 2.  Another "exception."  Also note the word,
"Privileged."

     Section 3.  This is vague, but carefully phrased.

     Section 5.  "The Court of Rights and Responsibilities" can
decide whether or not you have been guilty of "discrimination"--
This is harassment.

     Section 6.  What determines "eligibility?"

     Section 8.  "The practice of religion shall be privileged"--
a very dangerous statement.  This could deny our present
Constitutional Right to the "free exercise thereof."

     Section 10.  Note "National Sharing Fund"--Quite a
"gimmick."

     Section 11.  Who is to define the "appropriate tests of
eligibility" for education?

     Section 12.  In referring to "compensation," the word,
"just," is flagrantly omitted.  A serious and ominous omission.

     Section 15.  Who is to declare the "emergency?"


                            Article 1

                     "B"  Responsibilities.

     Section 1.  "A corresponding responsibility" is vague, and
could be quite dangerous.

is a command.

     Section 6.  "Fairness to all"--sounds nice, but very vague.

     Section 8.  Citizens shall be deprived of their arms.  This
is the age-old "gag" of all tyrants, their favorite technique, to
first deprive all law-abiding citizens of their means of
protection from assault.

     Section 11.  Aimed to "muzzle" Retired Officers of the Armed
Forces.  Why.

                           Article II.

                         "The Newstates"

     Section 1.  "There shall be Newstates"--This is very
subversive, inflammatory and communistic.  Note "The Boundary
Commission" and its extensive proposed powers "to decide."  This
is complete Regimentation.

     Section 2.  NO.

     Section 3.  NO.  Too much "planning" (to submerge the
individual.)

     Section 4.  Note "electoral Overseer."

     Section 11.  So-called "States Rights" are subject to
"Emergency" rulings by the Governors, with the approval of the
Senate of the Newstates of America, so all States' Rights hang on
a very slender thread.  Hence, they are down-graded.

     Section 12.  Suggests a Police State.

     Section 13.  Again, "The Boundary Commission" appears, with
firm control over the "Newstates."

     Section 15.  Looks very much like a Police State set up.  A
club over the "Newstates" wielded by the "Watchkeeper."

                          Article III.

                      The Electoral Branch

     Section 1.  This is something new for greater control over
the people.

     Section 4.  Note, "Recognition by the Overseer."

     Section 5-8.  "The Overseer shall promulgate rules for party
conduct..."

     Section 11.  "Expenses of the Electoral Branch" to be met by
an added 1% to the net taxable income of taxpayers...for
disposition by the Overseer."  Sounds, again, like a Police
State.

                Article IV.  The Planning Branch

     Section 1.  "There shall be a Planning Branch to formulate
and administer plans and to prepare budgets..."  Evidently, the
individual is not expected to do any planning on his own account.
His "day" is supposed to be over.

     Section 2.  "National Planning Board of 15 members appointed
by the President for terms of one to 15 years...the president
shall appoint a Chairman to serve for 15 years."  Quite an
important appointment.

     Section 5.  "...(these plans) to represent national
intentions tempered by the appraisal of possibilities."  This is
intentionally vague; a form of "Soviet-type" Regimentation,
pointing to a loss of Freedom for the Individual.  "National
life," is a reference to a "Super State."

     Section 8.  More Regimentation.

     Section 9.  "There shall be submissions..."  This is to
control, or actually kill Free Enterprise:  the destruction of
personal liberty.

     Section 10.  "Violations...shall be at the risk of the
venturer, and there shall be no recourse..."  This is a pure
Police State set-up..

     Section 14.  This is intended to be far-reaching and is very
dangerous.  It is a well-concealed "Give-Away" to help promote
"International Agencies."  It amounts to a "Blank Check" for
Foreign Aid.

                   Article V.  The Presidency.

          Chancellor of Financial Affairs...  Here is great
power, not spelled out, but a sort of "Blank Check."  Emphasis is
on foreign nations, but no reference as to how we can improve our
present bankers' system of privileged thievery of national
assets.  No mention at all.  Very dangerous and quite
unacceptable, to even contemplate.

          Chancelor of Military Affairs...very dangerous:
"emergency" appears, again.

     Section 10.  "Treaties or agreements with other nations,
negotiated under the President's authority, shall be in effect
unless objected to by a majority of the senate within ninety
days."  Too much power in the hands of the President.  He is to
be the strong man.

     Section 11.  This means complete control--so necessary for a
Dictator.

     Section 13.  "There shall be a Public Custodian, appointed
by the President, who shall have charge of properties belonging
to the government...building, construction and rentals..." (and
may have other duties).  The familiar "blank check" treatment,
again.

     Section 14.  There "Shall be an Intendant" to supervise
Offices for Intelligence and Investigation also "an Office of
Emergency Organization."  The "Intendant will also "charter non-
profit Corporations or Foundations" for useful public purposes"
... "exempt from taxation."  Useful to whom?  Why exempt from
taxation?  Firm Regimentation.

     Section 15.  "The Intendant shall ... be a counselor for the
coordination of scientific and cultural experiments and for
studies within the government and elsewhere."  Note that word,
"elsewhere."

              Article VI.  The Legislative Branch.

                         "A"  The Senate

     Section 1.  Note "if they so desire"...Who are "they?"  All
hand picked from a top group around the President.

     Section 2.  Retirement can be voluntary.  Life membership.

     Section 3.  "...elect as presiding officer a Convener" "for
two years"

     Section 4.  A quorum will be 60% or more.

     Section 6.  "The Senate may ask advice from the Principal
Justice concerning the constitutionality of measures before it."

     Section 8.  "In time of present or prospective danger caused
by cataclysm, by attack, or by insurrection, the Senate may
declare a national emergency" "and may authorize the President to
take appropriate action.  If the Senate be dispersed, and no
quorum available, the President may proclaim the emergency..."
When the Senate is dispersed would be a good time for the
President to declare an "emergency."

     Section 10.  Note the word, "abroad."  This is more veiled
international meddling in other nations' affairs to further the
financial interests of the wealthy International Political
Capitalists and their large industrial satellites.

     Section 11.  "The Senate shall elect, or may remove, a
National Watchkeeper (who)...shall gather and organize
information concerning the...competence and integrity of
governmental agencies and their personnel, as well as their
continued usefulness...and suggest the need for new and expanded
services...The Convener shall present the Watchkeeper's findings
to the Senate."  Very fancy!

                           Article VI.

                     The legislative Branch.

               "B"  The House of Representatives.

     Section 1.  "The House of Representatives shall be the
original law-making body of the Newstates of America."

     Section 2.  "It shall be a duty to implement the provisions
of this constitution..."

               d.  "To assist in the maintenance of economic
stability, the President may be authorized to alter rates by
executive order."  This clearly bears the mark of a contemplated
Dictatorship.

          5.  Very wide-sweeping and vague, but all-encompassing.

          8.  This is also very "fancy" and far-reaching.  What
is "world order" and who determines it?  Here again, the benefit
is for a wealthy few who are to be groomed to be our appointed
World Policemen.  The people are to bear the great expense of
this treasonous policy aimed at the destruction of the freedom-
loving people of this country.

          10.  This is clearly meddling in other nations' affairs
so that some Super Capitalists can thereby extract a profit.
This is sheer, self-serving socialist nonsense on an
international level to help the international-type Rockefeller-
Group-controlled corporations.

          11.  Vague, of course, and dangerous.  Who defines
"adequate" and "equal?"

          13.  Notice how quietly the word, "archives," appears?
Yes, keep the public in the dark.  Police State technique.  We
want none of it.

          15.  "To conserve natural resources by purchase...or by
regulation.

          16.  This is very dangerous and could readily become
confiscatory in character.

          18.  What is "adequate?"

          19.  "To provide for the maintenance of armed forces."
This most important matter is covered in only eight words.  No
mention of "adequate" armed forces.  No indication as to what way
the forces are to be organized and developed.  This is a
deliberate, crafty, "brush-off" for hidden, deceitful reasons.

                           Article VII

                      The Regulatory Branch

     Section 3.  Note that the "Big Boys" will be immune on
account of size.  This is the planned "apparatus" of a Dictator.
Does the "guiding hand" of Rex Tugwell's friend, Nelson
Rockefeller show here?

     Section 7.  It will be necessary to "play ball" with "The
Regulator."

     Section 8.  A labyrinth of Rules.

     Section 9.  What about the interest of the citizens, which
appears to be deliberately over-looked?

     Section 10.  This means FOOD--and don't forget that very
effective "tool," called "Rationing."

     Section 11.  More and More Rules.

     Section 12.  Still more Rules!

                          Article VIII.

                       The Judicial Branch

     Section 1.  Quite a galaxy of Courts on the National
level.  Pity an abused citizen--he could readily become a "non-
person," as in Soviet jargon.

     Section 14.  "The Supreme Court may decide:

          c.  Whether international law...has been ignored or
violated."  Here, the Principal Justice is the real boss, along
with the Judiciary Council.

                           Article IX

                       General Provisions

     Section 1.  Apparently the Congress will define the
qualifications of Citizenship.  Mr. Tugwell has wandered much too
far.

     Section 2.  Here, again, the emphasis is in Government, not
the Individual.

     Section 3.  "The President may negotiate for the acquisition
of areas outside..."  What say the People?

     Section 4.  This is indeed fancy Dictator stuff.

     Section 5.  They must be afraid of the people's reaction to
insist on a "blank check" to say what-ever they desire to say,
true or otherwise.

     Section 7.  This the mark of Big, central government.

                            Article X
                    Governmental Arrangements

     Section 2.  These are the "top dogs" in a Centralized
Socialist State set-up, far removed and different from what we
now have.

     Section 6.  Who is "protecting" the People from them?

                           Article XI

                           Amendments

     Section 1.  It is admitted here, by "Tugwell and Company,"
that there may be "deficiencies" in this constitution, but any
unfavorable "interpretations" of it are precluded.  A Dictator
will, naturally, institute all "changes."

     Section 2.  Twenty-five years, in this case, would be a very
long time.  The People--not the "Judicial Council" should suggest
new amendments.  This is a slick, deceitful section, made to
"read good" but to enhance so-called "managerial competence"--a
tricky phrase.  Also, it is a slap at our own Constitution, in
referring to the word "interpretation."  I wonder, why do we need
a New Constitution and New Amendments to correct "deficiencies?"
If our own Constitution needs any trimming, let the People
reflect their considered views concerning it--and not, as in
Tugwell's "monstrocity," have a Tyrannical, Godless Dictatorship
foisted upon us to further establish and enrich the One World
Corporate Socialists.

                           Article XII

                           Transition

     Section 1.  Referendum, in itself, if conducted honestly, is
a reasonable procedure, but it can readily become the "tool" of
deceitful sponsors for their self-serving purposes.

     Section 4.  "The President"--so-called, to hide a more frank
title.

     Section 5.  Note the words, "adjustments" and "disputes."
We know that our forebears gave much time and great thought to
this identical matter between 1778 and 1789.  Could it be that
the observations provided by Mr. Tugwell and his numerous
colleagues in the mis-named "Center for the Study of Democratic
Institutions" does not go back that far?

     Section 6.  Here "the cart" is deliberately placed before
"the horse"--meaning that Freedom and Liberty should properly
start with the People.  Be alerted, Fellow Citizens.

     Section 7.  This is a very dangerous situation which could
occur in the area of so-called "Transition" because it could be
deliberately "bogged down."  An aspiring Dictator could create a
chaotic situation in this country which would play directly into
his hand.  Ponder this.

     Section 8.  Here we go again.  Hurry, hurry, hurry--to fool
the people.

     Section 10.  This is a clear picture of "Strong-Arm"
Dictatorial methods.  Comply--or else!

     Section 11.  In this the President is given a free hand to
delete appropriate parts of this Article by mere proclamation.
Just what does "appropriate" mean?  Who determines this?

     Historically, this whole Tugwell promotion is not new at
all.  It points to the oldest kind of government in the world's
history--One Man Rule--but on a world-wide scale.  Informed
sources have stated that talented scholars, who look for avenues
of power, are often "acquired" by the sons of billionaires to
show them how their immense wealth can be directed so that they
can rule the world.  In this instance, let's give Rex Tugwell due
credit.

     This program has been made possible by deliberate and
successful attacks made on our time-honored Constitution by
Dictator-minded "One Worlders" to confuse bemused citizens and
purported "Representatives" on Capitol Hill and in our various
State Governments.  Many feel that the most appropriate and
effective way to confront Tugwell and the leading collaborators
of this proposed subversive "Constitution" would be via the
scaffold.

     It is high time to "clean house" and reset our belabored
Ship of State on a sound, constructive course.  Let the "chips"
fall where they may.

                       CONCLUDING COMMENTS

     I have said before, this subversive "New Constitution" is
not new at all.  History's pages portray the oldest form of
government known to man as "One Man Rule."

     The main thrust of Tugwell's deceitful document makes one
realize that a few, ruthless, misguided men of great wealth have
lost all social and civic balance due to their possessing a vast
call upon real wealth, through the medium of exchange called
"money."  They should be hauled before the courts and punished
for subversion, possible malfeasance, and even treason.

     Fellow Citizens, if your American Citizenship, and thus,
your sovereignty, is not worth defending, at all costs--as
something of great value; a shining heritage handed down to you
by the bold efforts of your enlightened ancestors--then you and
I, with our families, will continue our rapid descent on the
internationalist-constructed toboggan slide to obscurity.  We
have been unsuspectingly placed on this slippery slide by cunning
One-World-Order Forces.

     Today, in our Nation's Bi-Centennial Year, you and I should
ponder this deeply.  I say it is high time to "clean house," in
and out of government; to clean out, by all legal means, the
subversive elements of One-World-Order ideology, brought here
from abroad; the, build anew.  We can do it, and we must.
However, to survive as Free Men, as the masters of our individual
destiny, we should adhere, strictly, to the Articles of our
matchless Constitution.  Let's get started.

     Although many Americans have been brainwashed via the
intensive down-grading mis-education program foisted upon us by a
few wealthy Corporate Socialists to alter our form of government
for their profit, by control of monetary policies, vast raw
materials, and even peoples' lives, we must boldly confront this
sinister threat and ACT.  Repulse this secretive, well-financed
wave of Subversion before it becomes too late to act.

     I recall that my Father-in-Law, Franklin Roosevelt, once
stated, "Nothing happens in Politics by chance.  If it happens,
it was planned that way."  Hence, looking closely at this Tugwell
Constitution "Thing," it did not just "happen" overnight.  Far
from it.  What individuals secretly planned and financed it for
their Dictatorial Objectives?  Dare we ignore such a subversive
ideological onslaught coming from a non-elected, self-appointed
group?  Certainly not.  Are we to listen, abjectly, to the
honeyed words of "Front Man" Tugwell, the leading "Monday morning
Quarter-Back" on "The Center's" team for civic planning, as we
observe his efforts to pick purported "holes" in our revered
Constitution?  Certainly not.

     We must draw the battle lines, today.  In so doing, let us
recall that, in San Antonio, during the historic battle of the
Alamo, Colonel Travis lay on a pallet, severely wounded, after
days of sustained attack by vastly superior enemy forces.  Drawing
a line with his saber on the dirt floor of the Alamo, he said to
his small force of heroic defenders, gathered about him, "All
those who wish to stay with me and continue to fight, step this
side of the line.  Those who wish to depart, may do so now.
Texas history proudly states that all of the Alamo's defenders
stepped to Col. Travis' side of the line--to fight for Liberty.

     Americans can take great pride in recalling that famous war
cry, "Remember the Alamo!"  They can also say, referring to Greek
history, "Thermopylae had its messenger of defeat; the Alamo had
none."  Let us keep that faith.  Let us confront and put to route
these Misguided Imposters.

     Today, every American should "step this side of the line" to

                       THE FEDERAL RESERVE

                   AND OUR MANIPULATED DOLLAR

                   By Martin A. Larson, Ph.D.

     In layman's language the mind-boggling mysteries of the Fed
explained.  The nature of your money, how it is manufactured and
manipulated to cause wars, depressions, inflation.  The invisible
empire of the multinational bankers; how they reduce kings and
congresses to puppets and make productive men and women into
slaves.  How the Fed and the income tax operate together to
impoverish the public while transferring the assets of the world
to the super-rich.
