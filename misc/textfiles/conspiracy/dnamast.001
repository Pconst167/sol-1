                   A New Understanding of Aging and Disease
              based on subtle electrical phenomena in DNA and RNA

  DNA is composed  of  simple  chemicals  strung together like beads which
  form molecules known as bases.  There are only four types of these bases
  and they are :

                        Thymine  -  Adenine  -  Cytosine  -  Guanine

  Hereafter called         T           A           C            G


  Each base is attached to a sugar molecule  (deoxyribose) and a phosphate
  molecule in the DNA.  The base is directly attached to the sugar.

  These base-sugar-phosphate units of DNA are called nucleotides.

  When nucleotides are linked together, they form the chain we call DNA.

  DNA chains are  stupefyingly long.  A virus consists  of  about  200,000
  nucleotides, a bacterium  about  2  million  and  a  human  cell about 1
  BILLION (1,000,000,000)!

  Human DNA is broken up into 46 chromosomes  in  each of our 6.3 trillion
  body cells.  Chromosomes are microscopic rod-shaped bodies  which  carry
  genes.  Genes carry  hereditary  information  and  are  made  up of DNA.
  Genes make proteins and control enzymes.   Enzymes  in  turn control all
  cellular functions.

  All the DNA in a cell is contained in the chromosomes.

  If all DNA of one human cell were laid out straight, it would be about 1
  yard long.

  If this DNA string is imagined as a flexible ladder, it would have about
  6 billion steps.  The rails which form the ladder are  composed  of  70%
  sugar and 30% phosphate.

  Each of the  steps  is composed of the four bases, A-G-T-C.  These steps
  are secured to the rails by atoms of  hydrogen,  known as hydrogen bonds
  (the hydrogen atom has only one electron and one proton).

  The electrons orbit in a clockwise direction if contacting  a  phosphate
  section and counter-clockwise at a sugar section.

  At the end  of  A-Adenine  and  T-Thymine,  the electrons spin clockwise
  where it connects with the hydrogen atoms.

  At the end  of G-Guanine and C-Cytosine,  the  electrons  spin  counter-
  clockwise where it connects with the hydrogen atoms.

  This 4-based section which is analogous to a stair step is called a base
  pair.  This means the DNA is formed by 12 billion nucleotides which form
  stairsteps held together by two flexible rods.

  These rods twist to form a circular staircase which is termed the double
  helix of the DNA molecule.

  Every one of the 6.3 trillion human cells has at least one DNA.


                                    Page 2





  When a new  cell  is  formed,  the  DNA  must  make a perfect pattern of
  itself.

  This is thought to be done by splitting  the  ladder along the middle of
  the step and reforming two DNA's absolutely identical  and with the same
  coded sequence.

  In order to form a new DNA, another 12 billion nucleotides are required.

  A cell nucleus  has  at  least 8 different types of virus, either RNA or
  DNA.  There are  4 RNA types which  have  an  overall  negative  charge.
  There are 4 DNA types which have an overall positive charge.

  Each pair of virus (one negative RNA and one positive  DNA) attract each
  other to establish a bipole.

  This bipole must  be  adequately  established to provide protection from
  external electric, magnetic, or acoustic fields.  The bipole can also be
  affected by internal fields generated  from  excessive stress or loss of
  systemic vitality due to illness, lack of rest or a multitude  of  other
  causes.

  The bipole also  provides  a  means  for the accumulation and storage of
  electrical energy by making use of the properties of a virus.

  Viruses which are inactive take a crystalline  form.   This  crystalline
  form possesses piezoelectric  properties  which makes  it  sensitive  to
  electric and acoustic  waves, much as a microphone or antenna.  They can
  therefore either receive or transmit  electrical  or pressure (acoustic)
  waves.

  If a virus is in an active mode as is found in the cell  nucleus, either
  one DNA or  one  RNA  will  be  covered with protein.  Even in an active
  status, a virus  will possess the characteristics  of  a  crystal  which
  allows it to be sensitive to very high sound frequencies.

  An acoustic frequency up to 5 MHZ (yes, acoustic pressure  waves  can be
  generated up to  and  beyond  4  million  cycles as shown in the Olympus
  Acoustic Scanning Microscope) causes  the  two  viruses  to continuously
  vibrate against each other to produce a strain effect.

  When this strain effect is created in two crystals, electrical energy is
  produced which adds to the cellular vitality of all affected cells.

  If an ultrahigh acoustic frequency (over 5 MHZ) is applied,  an isolated
  inactive virus can  be  so  excited  as  to  cause  a  rapid temperature
  transition.  This brings about disintegration on a cellular level.

  This is much like the resonance effect of the Rife Frequency Generator.
  In the case  of  Rife,  energy  is applied  to  cell  structures  either
  acoustically or inductively from an external source.   This  causes  the
  cell membranes to  extend  beyond  their  eleastic  recovery limit which
  results in disruption and cellular death.

  The technique described  in  this paper  develops  the  energy  directly
  within the cell using its own "batteries".




                                    Page 3





  A one meter  long  Yagi  antenna is a direct analog for human DNA.  This
  calculates to a tuned radio emission  with  a  bandwidth from 375 MHZ to
  385 MHZ.

  Sound frequencies are used in the body for several purposes.

           1)  used by the DNA to acoustically scan for  the determination
               of what type of RNA is required

           2)  maintain the virus as an active bipole by the piezoelectric
               effect brought on by the strain of the high frequency waves
               between the two viruses of RNA and DNA

  The DNA is  under  the  constant  bombardment  of charged ions traveling
  through the nervous system.  These  charged  ions  serve to modulate the
  system frequencies which develop a high frequency sound  in the range of
  1.9 MHZ to  2  MHZ.   Since a resonant structure will absorb a frequency
  identical in phase  and  amplitude   to   itself,  then  a  non-resonant
  frequency will be reflected as an echo.  The detection of this returning
  echo effectively determines what type of protein (nucleotide) is missing
  in the cell.

  The complexities multiply  at this point, so for the  duration  of  this
  paper, we will use the principle of K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid).

  There are basically  3  controlling factors which involve the successful
  reproduction of an identical DNA molecule :

    1)  The amount of kinetic energy associated  with  the electron in the
        Hydrogen bonds.  (acts  as  the glue which holds  the  base  pairs
        (stair steps)  together  and  secured to the helix sugar/phosphate
        rails)

    2)  The number of base pairs per  turn  in  the  double  helix of DNA.
        (controls the amount of electrical energy or cellular  vitality by
        acting as  the  secondary of a Tesla coil which has the ability to
        alter its length and therefore its electrical potential)

    3)  The kinetic energy and frequency  of the charged ions which travel
        along the  nervous  system. (controls the ability  of  DNA/RNA  to
        precisely map the DNA pattern and duplicate it without error)

  Aging and the  reproduction  of  defective  DNA  is  caused by a lack of
  cellular vitality which is brought about  by a twisting of the DNA helix
  as the organism ages.  Since the DNA molecule only has a given number of
  base pairs (stair  steps)  due to its fixed length, this  twisting  adds
  more turns which  consequently  reduces the number of base pairs in each
  turn.  Effectively, # YEARS/# TURNS = # BASE PAIRS.

  As the organism goes through the birth,  maturation and death cycle, the
  DNA helix twists to "squeeze" out the number of base pairs (stair steps)
  per turn, this can be shown by the following :

       The DNA of the embryo cell in a mothers womb contains 46 base pairs
       per turn.

       In the  6th week of pregnancy, the DNA in the embryo  cell  has  34
       base pairs per turn.


                                    Page 4





       In the  10th  lunar month, a single DNA (half from the mother, half
       from the father) has reproduced itself more than 6 trillion times.

       When the baby is born, the process of reproduction decreases due to
       the rapid twisting of the DNA helix.

       At the age of 2 years, the DNA  has twisted to reduce the number of
       base pairs to 22 per turn.

       At the age of 21, the base pairs are 14 per turn.

       From the  age of 35 to about 55, the base pairs stabilize  somewhat
       at 10 per turn.

       At around  55  years  of age and beyond, the 10 base pairs per turn
       reduce to 6 and continue to decrease  until  the  organism achieves
       death.

  The kinetic energy of the electrons in the Hydrogen bonds  coupled  with
  the reduced energy  of  the  charged ions from the nervous system are so
  weak that the DNA stops reproducing  itself and the aging process begins
  to wreak havoc with the body.

  In addition, the  steadily  reducing  number  of  base   pairs  as  life
  progresses acts to  slowly  reduce  the  vitality  of  the  system  on a
  cellular level.

  This makes the "scanning" of the RNA  by  the DNA increasingly sensitive
  to outside sources of interference.

  If these outside   sources  of  interference  are  applied   while   the
  "scanning" process is  occurring,  the resulting pattern will be more or
  less distorted from the original.  If this occurs en masse, cancer and a
  host of other diseases can occur.

  Using Synergetic concepts, we can understand  how  a collective behavior
  could be established  in  the  body to force maverick  tissues  such  as
  cancer or other   diseases  resulting  from  distorted  DNA,  to  become
  enslaved to a ruling order parameter  for  the  establishment of optimum
  health and youth.

  Indications are that there are two beneficial effects  which result from
  application of these concepts.

        1)  Disease  can be halted and the body restored to optimum health
            by the restoration of the DNA to the maximum vitality.  The
            DNA pattern is no longer  subject  to  outside  distortion and
            therefore becomes self-optimizing.

        2)  Aging  can  be  halted and reversed by as  much  as  30  years
            dependent on the desired cellular vitality based on the number
            of base   pairs   per  turn.   Hair  darkens,  skin  tightens,
            digestion improves, hormones and enzymes resurge, etc..

  The technique would involve the application  of  an  inductive  field to
  irradiate the body for a short time.  The longer the body  is within the
  field, the more  DNA  replications  will occur due to the natural birth,
  life and death of all bodily tissues as proven by Dr. H.S. Burr of Yale.


                                    Page 5





  Each replication will  create  a DNA which possesses successively higher
  vitalities. This ever increasing cellular  energy  slowly "untwists" the
  DNA which increases the number of base pairs per turn.

  The result is the reversal of aging and the restoration of the DNA to an
  optimum pattern.  This restoration dissipates the patterns  which  allow
  disease to exist in the body.

  During the time  of  the  exposure, the natural replication of DNA under
  the influence of an inductive energy  field would cause the "new" DNA to
  be copied with the desired number of base pairs.

  This is brought about by an artifically induced lengthening of the Tesla
  coil secondary which increases the amount of electical potential.

  The increased electrical  potential on a cellular level  "untwists"  the
  DNA helix which  allows  more  base  pairs  (stair steps) per turn to be
  duplicated for each duplication.

  This gradual increase  in  cellular  vitality  automatically  gives  the
  DNA/RNA scanning process more energy to both record  and  duplicate  the
  old pattern onto a fresh duplicate.  This in turn, increases the rate of
  duplication for the removal of dead and dying tissues in the body.

  Thus wrinkles, toxins  and  various  other  problems  which  degrade the
  efficiency of the organism are removed.   Youth  and  maximum  health is
  restored and maintained through periodic application  of  the  inductive
  field.

  Thinking in Tesla  coil terms, a primary coil with a winding of 10 turns
  is inductively coupled  to a secondary  winding  of  100  turns.   If  a
  current of 1 ampere at 10 volts is applied to the primary,  a voltage of
  (10:100 or 1:10)  100  volts  at  100 milliamps will be developed at the
  secondary.

  If the DNA is thought of as being a  secondary  and  the  number of base
  pairs (stair steps)  per  turn  is  equivalent  to  the  windings  in  a
  secondary, we can  see  how a reduction in windings or stair steps would
  result in less electrical potential (cellular vitality).

  This in turn making the DNA progressively  sensitive  to outside stimuli
  for an eventual  mix-up  and distortion in the DNA pattern.   These  DNA
  distortions directly affect  the  formation  of  the genes which control
  enzymes which control  all  cellular   functions.   Without  intelligent
  control of the  duplication process, aging, disease  and  or  death  are
  inevitable.

  In order to  retard  the  aging  process  and  reduce the possibility of
  disease, what factors must we take into consideration?

     1)  We must find a means of stretching  or untwisting the DNA so that
         we can increase the number of base pairs per turn  to  a level of
         approximately 10 or more dependent on the desired age.

     2)  We  must  find  a  means  of increasing the kinetic energy in the
         electron of the Hydrogen bonds.




                                    Page 6





     3)  We  must  increase  the  energy  of  the  charged ions which flow
         through the nervous system.  This is best done by proper diet and
         exercise.

  What safety precautions must we also take into consideration?

     1)  The more devitalized, old or  weak  the body is, the more subject
         is the DNA to outside influences, therefore, the  applied  energy
         must be  of  sufficiently  low amplitude to prevent repelling the
         weakened hydrogen  bonds.    As   the   system  is  progressively
         strengthened, the field magnitude can be gradually  increased for
         further strengthening.

     2)  We  must  experiment  to  determine the duration and magnitude of
         induced energies acceptable to  increase the number of base pairs
         per turn in order to determine the limits of regression.

  What are some avenues to investigate beyond those already tested?

     1)  Magnetics,  refer  Davis  and  Rawls work with monopolar  fields.
         North pole  energies  cause an increase in surface tension and an
         increased life span, South  pole  energies  cause  a  decrease in
         surface tension  and  a  burnout due to excess  vitality  in  the
         system which leads to premature aging and death.

     2)  Lakhovsky  Multi-Wave Oscillator uses electrostatic induction for
         a wide range of frequencies into  the body.  A duplication of the
         original version as designed by Tesla would directly saturate the
         body with scalar type energy.

     3)  Secondary coupling using electro-magnetics which  treats  the DNA
         as a Tesla coil.  This would directly add energy to the system.
