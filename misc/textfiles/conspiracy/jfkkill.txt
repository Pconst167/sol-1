Subject: JFK:  List of Convenient Deaths
Date: 26 Mar 91 01:10:57 GMT

Here is the much requested list of people associated with the JFK 
assassination whose deaths are called convenient.  Bear in mind that
this is a terse summary of each individual's circumstances in relation
to the case.  Therefore, you may not get the full appreciation of why
a particular death is suspicious.  An asterisk indicates that a death is 
particularly suspicious.  Some 
   These deaths were part of why the House Select Committee on Assassinations
investigation got started.  However, they concluded that due to the highly
varied backgrounds of people involved, a proper actuarial study was not
possible.  
   Aside from the likelihood of x number of deaths over a period of time
of people connected with an invenstigation, there is also the trend that
the number of deaths actually increased closer to the time of these 
investigations.  The listing below is grouped by investigation.  Note that
in 1977, for example, before the HSCA investigation kicked off, six top
FBI officials scheduled to appear before the HSCA died.  William C. Sullivan,
for example, was out hunting, when he was shot by a man with a high-powered
rifle who said he mistook Sullivan for a deer.  This was *not* investigated
by anyone.  And so it goes.
   Some of the causes of death listed appear on the surface to be natural.
Keep in mind that the CIA developed methods to "make it look like an 
accident".  This was documented through the testimony of CIA technicians 
to the Church committee who told of TWEP technology (Termination With
Extreme Prejudice) in 1975.  These methods are designed to not be detected
in postmortem examinations.  I have a couple of exerpts of declassified 
CIA documents to demonstrate the case.  One of the techniques involves
the injection of cancer cells, heart attack inducement, as well as non-
chemical techniques which require no special equipment.  Based on the
strange circumstances of Jack Ruby's death in prison (he died from lung
cancer but the cancer cells were not the type that originate in the 
respiratory system).  Ruby wrote notes and spoke to several people saying
that jfk was killed by a conspiracy and that he had been maneuvered into
killing Oswald who was a fall guy.  He claimed to have been injected with
cancer cells when treated with shots for a cold.  He died just before he
was to testify in Congress.  He had told congressional investigators that
he wanted to talk but he needed protection.
   This list does not include the names of the many people who claimed that
their lives were threatened physically and verbally, as well as the many 
people questioned by the FBI who were intimidated and forced to change their 
testimony to agree with the official lone-gunman version.   
   This list is not meant to be proof of a conspiracy.  I believe a conspiracy
took place based on a plethora of circumstantial evidence, many involving
questions that are very strange if we are to believe the lone-gunman theory.
Many of the points I have raised can be rationally explained, but it is the
confluence of many aspects of the case which make me doubt the official 
version of events more than anything else.
