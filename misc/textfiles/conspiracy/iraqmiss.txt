IRAQ'S MISSILES
     Iraq has bought or developed an impressive array of tactical 
and medium-range ballistic missiles. These include:
  *  Al-Abid: Tested in Dec 1989 as a satellite launcher. Would 
have a range of 2,000km (1,250 miles) if used in a surface-to-
surface mode. It is a three-stage missile weighing 48 tons. The 
first stage has a cluster of five (Scud?) engines with a combined 
thrust of 70 tons. 
  *  Tammuz: Possibly another version (or use) of the Al-Abid. Has 
a range of 2,000km (1,250 miles). Was tested in Dec 1989. 
Warhead could be 500-1,000 pounds.
  *  Condor-II: Developed jointly with Egypt and Argentina. It 
would have had a range of 965km (600 miles) and carried a 1,000-
pound warhead, but the project was derailed by US diplomatic 
More : <Y>es/<N>o ?pressure. Iraq, which viewed Condor as only one of several 
programs, appears to have allowed it to drop while using much of 
the German and Italian technology in the Fahd. 
  *  Al-Husayn: A modified version of the Soviet Scud rocket. The 
Iraqis took three Scuds, removed the fuel tanks from one and cut 
them in half, then used the sections to lengthen the fuel tanks of 
the other two Scuds (increasing fuel from 4 to 5 tons). This gave 
them the 620km (400 mile) range to reach Teheran, although the 
warhead was reduced to as little as 300 pounds. [When it first 
appeared, the Al-Husayn raised questions about the INF treaty 
(which left Soviet Scuds in Europe as legal short-range missiles). 
It was thought that the range increase had been achieved by less 
extensive modifications and that the Soviets could evade the 
treaty with similar modifications. The US is now satisfied that the 
modifications are impossible to hide.] Reports that this missile 
used strap-on boosters are now known to have been only 
speculation on the part of Western analysts. The Al-Husayn is 
horribly inaccurate, with a CEP of (i.e. a 50% chance of landing 
within) 2,000m of its target. It is strongly suspected that Iraq can 
now manufacture the entire Al-Husayn. 
  *  Al-Abbas: This missile, an upgraded version of Al-Husayn built 
in Iraq, has been flight tested. It has a range of 900km (560 
miles), more than enough to reach Israel. The improved range 
More : <Y>es/<N>o ?does not bring more Iranian cities within striking distance, but 
does allow the missile to be launched from most of Iraq, rather 
than the limited area north of Al Amarah where most Al-Husayns 
were launched. The small 250-pound warhead would be little more 
than a nuisance (beyond the city block it fell into) unless it was 
equipped with a chemical charge. It is reportedly much more 
accurate than the older Al-Husayn, with a CEP of only 300m.
  *  Fahd: Originally begun as Project 395, Fahd is a solid-fuel 
family of missiles. One variant has a range of 250km, another of 
500km+. They will eventually replace Al-Husayn.
  *  SS-300: A Brazilian missile with a range of only 190 miles but a 
huge 2,200-pound warhead, enough to do serious military 
damage. Brazil has tested the engines of this missile; Iraq has 
them on order.
  *  Scud-B: A Soviet free-flight bombardment missile with a range 
of 175 miles and a 2,000-pound warhead. While the Iraqis have 
these, they are primarily used as a source of parts and 
technology for the improved Al-Husayn. 
  *  Frog-7: A Soviet artillery bombardment weapon with a range of 
only 45 miles and a payload of 1,000 pounds. Huge numbers of 
an improved version (range 90km), built locally as the Laith, were 
fired at Iranian forces and border towns during the war. Iraq is 
developing a chemical warhead for the Laith.

M87 design. There are 50km and 100km versions.
