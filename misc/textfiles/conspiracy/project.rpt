The following files consist of issues of a newsletter from a group called
"The Project" which is oriented toward unbiased, scholarly research on
conspiracy theories. Their working hypothesis appears to involve an
ongoing conflict between a "Judaeo-British-Royalist" conspiracy and 
a "Catholic-Jesuit-Vatican" conspiracy. They have assembled the best 
bibliography I have ever seen on conspiracy research, and although
it is repeated to some extent in each of the four issues, I have left in 
intact for the sake of completeness. The most extensive version with the 
best descriptions of the material is in the final file. I have not had 
time to read these in depth, or evaluate the content of their conclusions, 
But I do have a few comments. <putting on LaRouche supporter hat>

>From LaRouche's point of view, the Catholic Church appears as much less 
monolithic than is suggested by this material, and is home to a variety 
of competing factions, often with diametrically opposite intent. In 
particular, LaRouche does not regard the Jesuit order as authentically 
Catholic, but rather as an intelligence operation which penetrated the 
church under the direction of Loyala's controllers. Sorry, I don't recall 
who he attributes as the patrons of Loyala, but I suspect it would be the 
so called "black nobility" (not a racial designation :). Another thing 
which strikes me is a difference in analytical approach between these 
folks and LaRouche. LaRouche makes major use of philosophical issues 
as a touchstone for sorting out the complex webs of association and 
interconnection which have traditionally caused conspiracy researchers 
so many headaches. In general, he will look at an individual or community 
of thought in the light of their stance on the issue of Progress and the 
spread of technology, technological skills, and the economic benefits of 
technology among the broad nmasses of an ever expanding population. 
Individuals or groups thrown together by associations of circumstance, 
or separated by misleading ideological categories can still be recognized 
by their intellectual pedigree, especially as it affects their stance on 
these crucial issues. From the material I have seen, the Project workers, 
although they cite and discuss LaRouche, do not seem to have adopted this 
element of his method. This is too bad, because it works.

Vatican Down and Out?
Time to Reinstate Old Logo?


     It would have been difficult to script the Gulf War so that it more
thoroughly confirmed the Project's Vatican vs. Judeo- Masonic-Anglophile
conflict theory as expressed in the Summer 1989 through Fall 1990 issues
($12.00 for Series).  We will not re-hash the theory here, but only point to a
few of the hundreds of confirming "coincidences" which, combined, build our
case:

a)  Most telling, the Pope constantly opposed Bush's coalition building
efforts and preached against the onrushing war, as did the American Bishops
who ruled "blood for oil" to be the basis for an unjust war.

b)  In perfect opposition to the Vatican attitude, the Queen of England, in a 
rare televised intervention into a policy matter, strongly supported the war.

c)  Bush wrenched Gorbachev away from his budding Papal alliance for a "Europe 
from the Atlantic the Urals" to rejoin the Anglo-American alliance to rule the 
world through a naval choke hold on the world's oil supply.  With the Bush 
sanctioned slide back to Stalinism can we also expect a re-cocking of the 
Russian nuclear pistol with Germany in it sights?


d)  In solidarity with Iraq, Catholic Irish Republican Army terrorists mounted 
a bombing attack against England during the crisis.

e)  With the future of Anglo-American world rule clearly at stake, Bush acted
predictably--better the Mideast oil be destroyed, and it could have been if
Saddam had mustered the guts to continue his attack into Saudi Arabia before
the US could build-up than allow the oil to fall out of the hands of
Anglo-American satraps.

f)  After encouraging the Iraqi attack and chancing an Iraqi onslaught into 
Arabia that could have been stopped only with nuclear weapons, predictably
again, Bush refused to negotiate or compromise, keeping his eye on
re-establishing the recently crumbling New World Order of his Anglophile
roots.  He secured the future stability of the Anglo-American cabal's regional
Jewish and Arab proxies, and reminded them at whose favor they exist, with an
overwhelming demonstration of the new air power.  Now, Caesar's enemies can be
systematically reduced to ruble building by building, tank by tank, cannon by
cannon, bunker by bunker, and factory by factory!  The campaign against Iraq
was relatively short and merciful as compared to what might be done next time
against Libya, Syria, Pakistan, India, South Africa, Germany, or others who
may acquire or distribute poison gas, biological, or nuclear weapons or
attempt to market their natural resources outside the confines of the
ecologically sound," Empire of the City networks.

Momentarily, I considered what wonders an omnipotent Caesar could do to bring 
justice to the world.  Kurdistan could be resurrected from Iraq, Turkey, and
Iran.  Croatia from Yugoslavia.  The Baltic States from the Soviet Union.
Tibet from China.  Mongolia from China.  The Ukraine from the Soviet Union.
Russia from the Soviet Union.  Everything from the Soviet Union.  Destruction
of all weapons of mass destruction except Caesar's.  But then, reality set-in.
Knowing his powers to be more limited than I dreamed, the real Caesar ordered
the fighting stopped well before the forces necessary to maintaining Saddam's
Baathist Party State could be destroyed.  No need to rebuild the enemy this
time!  With true Imperialist impotence to do good, Bush acted only maintain
Anglo-American dominance, encouraging the Baathist butchers to slaughter their
helpless minorities and start building toward a new regional "Balance of
Power."

         It is easy to see that events are congruent with the Project thesis 
and no overt contradiction exists and many will accept the idea of a 
reinvigorated Judeo-Masonic-Anglophile ascendancy toward a New World Order, 
but most conspiracy theorists will see the Vatican-Prussian (Holy Roman 
Empire) opposition as inconsequential, a figment of our imagination, 
controlled by the conspiracy, or, worse, as evidence of our anti- Catholic 
bigotry.  Fortunately, a book by Malachi Martin, a Vatican insider and 
intimate of John Paul II, has appeared that confirms the Project thesis.



Pope John Paul II & the Liberation of Eastern Europe
]

         The Keys of this Blood:  The Struggle for World Dominion Between Pope 
John Paul II, Mikhail Gorbachev, and the Capitalist West by Malachi Martin is 
extremely tedious to read.  His pains to maintain a primarily religious
identity for a Pope who he simultaneously claims is primarily a geopolitical
operator is accomplished by a repetitious sanctimonious wordiness.  In
addition, Martin is careful not to be too specific in identifying the Pope's
disreputable "Black International" allies.  This results in more worthless
words piled atop one another.  However, the rewards of "wading through" this
mess are great.

         Martin claims the Pope's mentor, Cardinal Wyszynki conceptualized the 
three geopolitical contenders as 1)  The Golden International, the financial 
powers of the world, 2)  The Red International, the Marxist-Leninist 
Party-State apparatus, and 3)  The Black International, the forces of the
traditional Roman Catholic Church (and Holy Roman Empire).  Reflecting the
wishful thinking of the current Pope, Martin dismisses the "Golds" as mired in
hopeless post-WWII decline, postulating the real competition to be between the
Reds and Blacks within the framework of a new mutual tolerance for each
other's mutually exclusive basic philosophies, atheism versus revealed
religion, made possible by shared opposition to capitalism's
individualist/materialist competition and a vision of a future
world-dominating Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals.  Bush's Gulf War can
be seen as the Judeo-Masonic-Anglophile/Royalist cabal's refutation of
Martin's book and the Pope's geopolitics.  Martin is now clearly wrong on the
following points:

a) The Decline of the West's Capitalist System.  Martin sees the capitalist 
system as resting on the now shaky tripod of post WWII 
institutions--International Trade, International System of Payments, and 
International (US) Military-Political Hegemony--built by the Wise Men of the 
West, his code word for the anti-Catholic Judeo-Masonic-Anglophile/Royalist 
cabal.  Martin was totally taken-in by the "Vietnam syndrome" analysis of 
American military will and power, forgetting that the Vietnam War was a war to 
impose the Catholic dictator Diem on Vietnam was conceived by Pope Pius as 
part of his 1950's ill-fated anti- communist crusade and never was supported 
by the Wise Men!  When a war supporting their New World Order was required, 
the Wise Men had no problem pulling it off!  The idea that the Wise Men are 
playing "hopeless catch-up" is now shown to be illusory.

b)  Failure of Democratic-Materialist Ideals.  Contrary to Martin, it is 
specifically what Catholics and Communists hold in common, authoritarianism 
(Party-State or Church-State) and anti-consumerism, that has been rejected, 
not the materialist philosophy that capitalism holds in common with communism!  
Ex-communist serfs want their jeans, rock music, and free thought--only a few 
really go to Church!  Competitive enterprise, even when severely hampered, 
delivers to the consumer.  Authoritarianism doesn't!  Apparently Martin does 
not realize that the "politically correct," self-styled Marxism of America's 
College Campuses is a far cry from real Marxist Leninist Party Statism of 
communist countries.  In reality it is simply a hyper- liberal coalition of 
minority ethnic, racial, feminists, and life-style protest movements that 
wouldn't be tolerated in a Party State for a moment!  Marxist-Leninist Party 
Statism, contrary to Martin is far, far from "engulfing the west."

         According to Martin, the Pope has taken his geopolitical tack because 
the central authority of the Catholic Church over Catholics is, itself, 
crumbling under the attack of what he calls the "anti-Church" or
"Super-Force", those Catholic leaders who under the influence of "modernism"
(Martin won't admit modernism is controlled by the Wise Men) would tear-down
the Vatican- centered Hierarchy/Papal Monarchy and replace it with a loosely
federated collection of "national churches" that would determine policy and
doctrine "democratically" like some Protestant churches!  Presumably, Martin
means the Pope had to use his geopolitical clout before he lost it.  If he had
been successful, which it now appears he was not, he could have used his
enhanced geopolitical power to restore Catholic "traditionalism" to the
Church.

         Perhaps the most fascinating part of the book is the last, "Chapter 
36:  Scenario the Consistory", in which Martin presents a fantasy (the 
Pope's?) in which a future Pope, after geopolitical victory, assembles all his 
Cardinals in a  tightly guarded room at the Vatican, lays down a severe policy
of restoring "traditional" Catholicism at the expense of the "Conciliar
Church" of Vatican II, and, testing them with the traditional act of "double
obeisance," purges the Church of "modernism" wholesale, starting on the spot
with recalcitrant cardinals!

         Not only is the Vatican crawling with para-military units during all 
this, but the traditional, ceremonial "Swiss Guard", though present at the 
entrance, is strangely absent from the inner sanctum of the Vatican assembly 
of Cardinals, suddenly replaced there by ceremonially attired Knights of the 
Sovereign Military Order Malta!  Clearly, this is Martin's "code-recognition"
that the current Pope represents a Knights of Malta ("Black International" in
Martin's jargon) coup.  Either that, or Martin has been reading the Project!



The Black International


         In reading the full breadth of "conspiracy literature" during the 
"Gulf Crisis," a parallelism of propaganda with that of Iraq became apparent, 
in spite of denials and "formula" condemnations of Saddam.  Denial that Bush's 
bombing was "surgical" with only collateral damage to civilians and 
allegations of secret Israeli vengeance bombing were some of the hallmarks of 
this parallelism--now in clear contradiction to objective post-war reports.  
In addition to such well-known conspiracy theory publications as Carto's 
Spotlight and LaRouche's New Federalist, this parallelism extended to some 
Vatican "peace pleading" and was especially evident in 30 Days In the Church 
and the World, the controversial, anti-Masonic Catholic magazine that we have 
long suspected represents a lightly laundered version of the world-view of the 
Papal-Knights of Malta cabal.  Also, 30 Days has been promoting an old Church 
doctrine, "Better a Saracen than a Gnostic!"  This could explain the apparent 
Vatican- Fundamentalist-Islamic-Prusso-Teutonic-PanSlavic-Holy Roman 
Empire-(Japanese?) fascist/nationalist axis that may exist as a centrally 
directed force to oppose the onrushing Judeo-Masonic-Modernist World Imperium 
as enforced by Caesar Bush.  The anti-American, anti-Masonic 30 Days rhetoric 
reached such heights during the "Gulf Crisis" that inflammatory articles were 
censored in both France and America due to determined protests from modernist 
infected or modernist appeasing segments of the Church.  In America the 
censoring was done by the Jesuit's Ignatius Press which publishes the American 
edition.

         A number of items in Malachi Martin's book indicate, as we have 
long-suspected, that much of the "responsible conservative movement" (esp. Pat 
Buchanan) and most of the conspiracy expos
 movement is consciously or 
unconsciously under the sway of the Vatican, ie. that "conspiracy theory" is 
essentially a covert Vatican-Jesuit project.  Recall that a promoter of 
"Liberation Theology", Black Pope Pedro Arrupe, also was quoted in None Dare 
Call It Conspiracy as the inspiration of Gary Allen's theories.  Need we 
mention Catholic Carroll Quigley of Jesuit Georgetown University?  To say 
nothing of Fathers Couglin and Fahey!  (Please note that I have already 
admitted that I was under such unconscious influence from 1964-1986!)  Martin 
indicates the following factors that give some credence to the existence of
such a covert "axis":

a)  Pope John Paul II's "Treasonous" (to Poland) Ties with Germany.  Martin 
mentions how Wojtyla and his mentor Cardinal Wyszynski were often accused of 
"treason" by the Polish communists for their collaboration with Germans.  Of 
course, the Pope's right hand man is now German Cardinal Ratzinger who he has
put in charge of the "Inquisition".  The German input to Islamic weaponry,
especially to poison gas and missiles is well-known.  German-Islamic
collaboration dates back to WWI via the Berlin to Baghdad Railway.  In WWII
the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem supported Hitler.

b)  Caucasian Racism Integral to Pope's Geopolitical Plans.  In "Chapter 21: 
The Pacts of Polishness", Martin reviews the Pope's Eurocentric geopolitical 
outlook, harkening back to the Caucasian Race as the historical 
linguistic/racial foundation of a Europe united from the "Atlantic to the 
Urals" and, in tandem with European North America, dominating the world.  This 
program is in clear agreement with "populist-nationalist-white racist" 
sentiment in America and around the world and is in polar opposition to what 
Martin calls the "transnationalist" program we see promoted by the 
Judeo-Masonic Imperium.  The "politically correct" campus radicals are 
spearheading the "conspiracy's" program to disavow the twin collectivisms of 
its anti-Vatican origins: Jewish/Zionist chauvinism and Anglophile, WASP 
racism through enforced "multi-culturalism" and ending the Eurocentric slant 
of history and literature curriculums.  "No more worshipping the thoughts of 
'Dead White Men'."  Apparently, the "conspiracy" believes, contrary to the 
Vatican-lead forces, that a stable World Order is impossible if the White race 
and its Jewish appendage (some would say rulers) continue to dominate other 
races.  Loyalty to the Judeo-Masonic principles, not race or ethnicity, is to 
be the criterion for acceptance in the New World Order.  This may, of course, 
be only for public consumption as "British Israel" outlets of the Crown 
continue to push the WASPS as the true, Biblical "Israel" along with Sephardic 
Jews.  The remaining Khazar Jews and Caucasians are cast into the outer 
darkness of the "unchosen."

         It is impossible to let Malachi Martin's book drop without mentioning 
the really weird part:  Martin claims the Pope expects a miracle of the sun in 
the sky (a la the Fatima miracle) to restore the fortunes of the Church very 
soon.  In the minds of some, this prediction has once again raised the 
possibility of a "high technology" being used to fake a miracle or "space 
invasion" to promote world government.  Have the Pope's intelligence sources 
obtained knowledge of such plans?  Is he floating in advance a Catholic 
explanation just as the New Age movement has floated their own explanation of 
such a future event?  Is this connected to the increasing intensity of rumors 
that the US government has made a deal with "Gray Aliens," trading abductees
for technological wonders?  I won't believe in spacemen until I am presented
with publicly verifiable evidence, but I do take seriously the possibility of
their propaganda value for The New World Order!



The Corona Rules

By An Anonymous Supporting Subscriber


         I believe that we are dealing with a conspiracy structure that
consists of three factions which are manipulated against each other by the
Corona in a futile struggle for world dominion.  The three factions are
unaware that the Corona exists and actually exercises the world dominion that
the three factions seek in vain through it's successful manipulation of them.
The factions, unknowingly, form a system of checks and balances that serves to
perpetuate and guarantee the Corona's power and control.

         Each one of the three factions believes that it has the only 
legitimate claim to world dominion.  The Bible is a chronicle of the formation 
(set-up) of the factions of the conspiracy.  The factions are absolutely 
convinced of their beliefs.  They have been subjected to a long conditioning 
process in order to assure this.  The factions provide "Royal" bloodline pawns 
and high priest/Pope pawns that serve as cover (like the Jews only on a deeper 
level) for the Corona.

         The three faction originate from two Biblical bloodlines and the 
Order of Melchizedek.  Faction I is the descendants of Seth, who was a son of 
Adam and Eve.  Faction II is the descendants of Cain, who was the son Lucifer 
and Eve.  Faction III is the Catholic Church/Vatican, a re-organization of the 
Order of Melchizedek founded by Shem, Noah's eldest son.  Christ, a Corona 
super-agent, was removed from the scene after a staged crucifixion, having 
accomplished the conspiracy set-up process by means of a triple cross against
Factions I, II, and III.

         The Anonymous Supporting Subscriber has applied the theory outlined 
above to a wide range of world events and conspiratorial intrigues behind the 
scenes.  If you want more information address letters to "Anon Supporter" care

This was another text insert box in WP51...

"Of course, the cardinals recognized (some more quickly than others) the
uniforms and insignia of the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta.  That
solemnizing fact--you couldn't but be impressed by the formality created by
the Knights--together with the bareness of the bulletin notice, induceda
quietude among the cardinals in which a lwo whispering was their loudes sound
even before Valeska (future Pope) had entered>"  The Keys of This Blood by
Malachi Martin, page 687.



This was a text insert box quoting Malachi Martin's book:

"The geopolitical idea so often expressed by Pope John Paul and Mikhail
Gorbachev that the world, or at least a good part of it, comprises 'one
family' is not farfetched.  There is a broad concensus among anthropologists,
linguists, agospecialists, and cultural experts that some relatively short
time after the last glaciers receded from the Eurasian landmass--about twelve
thousand years ago--there flourished the remote ancestors of almost all the
peoples now occupying "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals," and North
America, as well."

Sometime before 7000 BC, a vast revolution changed the Caucasians' way of life 
and ushered them on to their destiny...earliest farming communities known to 
us existed in that area...Human procreation became a source and a cause of 
blessings...More hands were the key to tilling more soil. (source of Vatican 
position on birth control?--Editor)...The sequel is easy to understand.  More 
soil-- more land--meant outward expansion...("Blood and Soil?" "Lebensraum?" 
--Editor)...Constantly on the go, the Caucasian people superimposed themselves 
and their language where they went..." The Keys to This Blood by Malachi 
Martin, Pages 497-498.

research of a private network dedicated to applying the scientific method to
conspiracy theories of history.  Current issues of the Project revolve around
clarifying, elaborating, and testing the hypothesis that a traditionally
London-centered world money cartel, under the patronage of the British Crown,

                                 A Note On Recommended Reading

The books, reports, and articles recommended are not without serious faults
from the point-of-view of the Project.  Most are guilty of blatant partisan
bias, too often on the basis of ideology, religion, race, class, interest
group, etc.  Unfortunately, by its nature, ruling class research is not and
probably never will be solely the province of disinterested scholars. 
However, keep in mind that the bootlicking, lying court historians
cultivate only the appearance of objectivity and, therefore, deserve even
less credit than some of the partisan authors we have recommended.

The Project hypothesis is unique in ruling class-conspiracy literature. 
None of the authors recommended present the Project theory.  The
recommended reading simply contributes facts, research leads, evidence,
testimony, insights, theorizing, and speculation relevant to the Project's
progress toward uncovering the objective nature of the ruling class-
conspiracy or power organism(s).  Do not judge the Project theory by the
readings recommended. We recommend many authors not for objective
information, but for insight into the propaganda of the social power
organism which holds them in thrall. For the evolving Project theory
consult only the Project back issues, especially the August 1985 Issue
($9.00) for the original theory nd the Winter-Spring 1989-90 Issue ($9.00)
for a major revision of working hypothesis.

Is Caesarism the Conspiracy?

 An enormously popular conspiracy theory (that was perhaps best presented in 
Taylor Caldwell's novel, A Pillar of Iron [Life of Cicero]) holds that the
ultimate goal of the ruling class/conspiracy for America consists in moving
from the virtues of "Republic" with its rigorous limits on government power,
rule of law, and checks and balances to the degradation of unlimited rule or
"Caesarism" of one man.  This theory implies, but does not often explicitly
state, that America as a social organism is in morphic resonance a la
Sheldrake's Presence of the Past with Rome, perhaps through the intentional
seeding of America by the Founders Fathers with Roman forms and archetypes:
bicameral legislature, Senate, architecture, etc, etc.

      Those unfamiliar with the remarkable parallels between the America's 
system and history and that of Rome need to read Amaury de Riencourt's The 
Coming Caesars and American Empire and Haskell' New Deal In Old Rome.  While 
Haskell deals with the parallel resort to collectivist economic measures under 
the impoverishing strain and drain of Imperial adventure, more fundamentally, 
de Riencourt demonstrates the similarity of America's and Rome's geopolitical 
positions, namely that of representing a more powerful new Imperial embodiment 
of an old culture--America of England/Europe and Rome of Greece.  Rome was 
responsible for defending Greece from the alien Parthian empire to the East as 
America has been responsible for defending Europe from the hostile Soviet 
Union to the East.  De Riencourt examines in detail how under the stress of 
world empire and domestic economic pressures the tendency toward mass 
democracy culminating in Caesarism is inevitable in the Republican system 
shared by America and Rome.  Though America has so far avoided the fall into 
true Caesarism or "Presidents for Life", Franklin Roosevelt can only be viewed 
as a very close call, a close call indeed, and other presidents such as 
Jackson, Wilson, and Lincoln have risen to near Caesar status.  Apparently, 
the American system, in contrast to that of Rome, can provide an "Imperial 
Presidency" for the duration of a crisis (Military or Economic), but return 
rather smoothly to Congressional Bickering after the crisis has passed.

      Perhaps this helps provide a key to where the Taylor Caldwell theory 
that "the conspiracy equals Caesarism" misses the mark.  It is not "Caesarism" 
that the ruling class/conspiracy wants (Caesar can be as difficult to control 
as Congress).  It is successful World Imperialism best typified by Rome.  
Rome's Empire was not a product primarily of the Emperors, but of the 
Republic!  The Masonic conspiracy modeled America's political forms on Rome's 
because they were forms known to be compatible with the future World Imperial 
role they sought for America (Novus Ordo Seclorum--New Order of the Ages).  
The Masonic conspiracy fashioned a Presidency that would be "Imperial" as 
required, but could always be checked by the "Money Power" through Congress 
and the Supreme Court, the States, or the people to avoid the notorious 
excesses and "flakiness" of all powerful Emperors that did much to undermine 
the Roman Empire.

      So far, the question in America remains:  whose Congress? whose 
President? whose Supreme Court? whose Governor? whose People? The Vatican's or
Queen's?  Maybe eventually, if the growing "multi-cultural" ethnic tribalism
and "Balkanization" makes America ungovernable democratically, Whose Caesar!

What Is Happening to the Economy?

      Since only the most "religious" readers of the Project are likely to 
remember our economic analysis of Summer 1988 (Volume V, Number 3), we will
review:

      In spite of Reaganite propaganda to the contrary, we have been in a 
depression since the Volker engineered interest rate spike in 1979 (20% plus) 
that brought the "post WWII" economic prosperity to an end exactly 50 years 
after "1929" in true Kondratief 50 year cycle fashion.  This primary fact is 
veiled from most analysts, even Kondratief analysts, by the monetary mechanics 
of the Post WWII welfare/warfare state.  The built-in stabilizer of monetizing 
a wasteful budget deficit prevents the classic crash that resulted in 30% 
unemployment in the 30's and substitutes a "real goods" depression in which 
increasingly worker grinding, labor intensive economic activity persists as 
the new money flows into the economy, but real wages and living standards 
(adjusted for inflation) slip lower and lower.  Workers either scramble 
frantically for less and less or leave the work force and find a subsistence 
in the welfare end or fade away in crime, prison, or other forms of 
degradation.

      After setting the preceding Kondratief scenario (driven by a 50 
generational cycle within the conspiracy itself), we predicted a new long-wave 
expansion (not prosperity in the old sense) based on issuing money through a
World Conservation Bank which would hold wilderness areas and other natural
resources off the market as collateral.  We did not predict true prosperity,
but only an increasing tempo of grinding labor intensive activity as the
populace is denied access to reasonably priced natural resources under the
guise of "environmentalism."

      Our error in 1988 was in suggesting (hoping?) that we were perhaps 
already at the bottom of the cycle.  Unfortunately, it is now clear that we 
were not.  This may be the bottom now or an even worse bottom may occur within 
a year or two!  However, it now appears that in spite of Bush-Congressional
pig- headedness regarding the budget deficit and Federal Reserve foot
dragging, the debt monetization is now proceeding full blast and will check
the economy's free fall soon in preparation for the predicted,
"environmentally sound" World Conservation Bank monetization of untapped world
resources, in particular, the Amazon, Africa, Siberia, Asia, etc.

      Bush's repudiation of Reagan-Conservative-Vatican economic growth and 
concurrence in the shocking "bottoming out" the economy that could very well 
cost him his second term can only be another example of his Anglophile "Skull 
and Bones" roots taking precedence over his personal ambitions.  We can expect 
Bush to systematically repudiate the temporary Vatican-Conservative alliance 
that brought him to power as he moves back to Rockefeller-Republican 
positions.  The final straw will be when he moves to support abortion, 
probably only if he is elected for his second term.  Environmentalism: The New 
Radicalism?

      Many conservative journals in the "responsible" conservative, Buckleyite 
orbit have been pushing the line that socialism is dead and that 
environmentalism will be the new credo for radicals, insightfully noting 
(especially ex-radical David Horowitz in the National Review) that the alleged 
intended beneficiaries but actual victims of the radical elitists, "the 
people", have finally wised-up and rejected their socialist program, something 
the new radical constituency, "the environment" or "nature", will never be 
able to do!  Environmentalism will be the perfect arena for radicals to act 
out their hatred for real human beings, dashing their hopes and dreams for a 
decent life in the name of an unobtainable "return to nature".

      Though additional clean-up or anti-pollution costs must be imposed on 
the economy whenever a human action can be shown to damage other human beings,
we tend to concur with the conservatives that something else, but not
necessarily only hatred for humanity among radicals, is at work in the
increasingly dominating and extreme environmental purity movement.  A
something else that would lead the well-financed, Club of Rome worshiping
World Watch magazine to state during Desert Storm that the real crisis in the
middle east is population growth.  A something else that would lead George
Bush, over the opposition of conservatives, to cave-in to the unproven "global
warming" and disproved "acid rain" agendas of the radical environmentalists.
A something else that allows the environmental extremists to get away with
"snail darter" and "spotted owl" frauds whenever the Establishment get serious
about stamping-out a particular economic activity
...and on and
on.

      In fact, the ruling class/conspiracy sees the earth as their own and the 
great mass of human beings, especially those exceeding the number of required 
servants and soldiers, as trespassers in the same way King John, in Robin 
Hood, refused to allow starving peasants to use lands and forests reserved for 
his personal hunting expeditions!  This is the mind set behind Establishment 
support for Global 2000 and Club of Rome environmental extremism in general.
It was also the mind set behind Establishment support for Communism as shown
in the Winter 1987-88 Project.  Communism was seen by the Establishment as a
method of retarding normal capitalist development of entire continents, namely
the Eurasian land mass ceded to the Soviet and Chinese communists.  Though
human initiative was drastically curtailed, what they didn't foresee was that,
in the absence of a legal system in which individuals and groups could sue to
redress damages, commissars would operate their plants to meet quotas in total
disregard of environmental damage!

      Thus we see that what would otherwise be only a psychological quirk of a
minority of intellectuals, namely radical hatred for humanity, is amplified
and spread to society at large, first to promote socialism and now to promote
environmentalism.

Mystery of Masonry's Origin Solved?

      Long-time readers will recall, probably with considerable irritation, 
that we have been promising a definitive article on Francis Bacon and the
founding of the "modern" conspiracy since 1985.  Each time we thought we were
ready to finalize such a report we have discovered more sources of information
that threw the premises of the work up to that point into doubt.

      In spite of our promise that research was nearing completion in the 
Washington DC: Third and Final Rome?  catalog issued this Summer, a new 
hypothesis has again cast doubt on our previous work.  Initially in 1985, our 
theory was that the conspiracy was essentially Anglophile at core beginning 
with Henry VII (1485-1509) and coming into its own with Elizabeth I 
(1558-1603), suffering setbacks under the Catholic or Catholic leaning
Stuarts, but emerging triumphant with William of Orange's "Glorious
Revolution" of 1688 that resulted in the founding of the Bank of England,
Masonry, and the Royal Society under the patronage of the Crown, thus, setting
the stage for true world domination.

      The Crown was seen as gathering otherwise unorganized and powerless 
anti-Vatican forces into alliance with it such as Jews and Moslems (esp. 
mystics--cabalists & sufis), Gnostic heretics, Templar heretics, etc. rather 
than as a product of such anti-Vatican forces.  This allowed the Crown to 
strike a pose above the fray while its Jewish and Secret Society organs did 
its dirty work and received the blame...a theory the Crown itself promoted
with the unconscious help of the Vatican!

      This theory met nearly 100% disagreement from all points on the 
conspiracy research spectrum!  Of course, this was of no concern to us since 
we consider the "established" conspiracy theories to be planted by the 
conspiracy itself.  However, several books on the "continuity" of Masonry 
began to sway our enthusiasm for our thesis.  Pro-Masonic scholar John J. 
Robinson in his Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry seemed to make 
an excellent case that Freemasonry was simply the Knights Templar "revealing" 
in 1717 their unbroken existence since the attempted Vatican suppression of 
their order in 1307.  Peter Partner's The Murdered Magicians:  The Templars 
and Their Myth seemed to second this thesis on a "power of myth" if not 
physical continuity basis.  Until now, we futilely hashed over the pro's and 
con's with numerous correspondents while the projected report languished.

      Not until Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh of Holy Blood/Holy Grail 
fame came out with their The Temple and the Lodge were we able to return to 
our original thesis with good conscience.  Baigent and Leigh were able to show 
convincingly how Templarism had survived continuously as Masonry, originally 
under the patronage of the heretical Robert Bruce of Scotland, and later under 
fragmented, doctrinally questionable, but basically Vatican aligned, auspices, 
especially the Stuarts (Jocobites).

      However, Baigent and Leigh also showed clearly that the founding the 
Grand Lodge in 1717, far from being a "revealing" of a pre-existing Secret
Society, was an artificial take-over of Masonry by the then Protestant Crown
of Britain based on its military triumph over the pro-Stuart Scottish
Rebellion of 1715.  This was necessary to remove pro-Stuart (Jacobite) and
pro-Vatican elements from Masonry world-wide in preparation for turning
Masonry into Britain's premier covert intelligence service (See August-
September 1985 issue of the Project, page 6--"1717").  The success of the
British Crown in capturing Masonry ineluctably lead to eventual Vatican
repudiation of its previously loyal, if somewhat heretical, underground
intelligence network!



Judaism and Christianity: Both Roman Inventions?

      No issue of the Project has drawn as much criticism as our Winter 
1990-91 issue which introduced the theory that Christianity is an artificial 
religion concocted by the Roman Oligarchy to pacify and unify the Empire.  We 
also, in that issue, referred to the equally controversial theory that 
Christianity was a Jewish plot to destroy the Roman Empire!  The objections by 
readers were so intense that several copies of the Project were returned with
notes scrawled by thick, dark "magic markers"!  Well, as the previous article
on the "Founding of the Conspiracy" should indicate, our focus is and shall
remain the anti-Vatican conspiracy which came into its own under Elizabeth I,
not the founding of the Roman Religion which may be forever lost, along with
its predecessors, the religions of Babylon and Egypt, in the mists of time.

      However, we can't help but call attention to an author we recently 
discovered who has interesting theories regarding the founding of the Roman 
and Jewish Religions.  James Ballantyne Hannay who wrote in the 1920's 
describes in his The Decline and Fall of the Roman Religion how the Romans not 
only set- up Christianity, but invented Judaism itself after the conquest of 
Egypt which opened to them the ancient secrets of manipulation of the masses 
through religion.  Some of his best evidence is the obvious artificiality of 
the "Hebrew" alphabet and language that Hannay claims was invented by a team 
of Roman Scholars.  It should be noted that these scholars, if they existed, 
could have been working with the accumulated knowledge of Egypt's Library in 
Alexandria.  That the Library later burned under suspicious circumstances, 
destroying the accumulated wisdom of the ages, may have been no co-incidence!

      Hannay also wrote a massive tome entitled Sex Symbolism in Religion.  He 
makes startling revelations about Rome's allegedly planned transition from a 
religion of human/animal sacrifice and organized prostitution (Revenue from 
Temple Prostitutes) to Christianity which only symbolically embodies these 
Pagan traditions.  Is this the Stoic plot to manipulate the "passions of the 
incurably ignorant masses" broached by Reuchlin and Duran?

      Frankly, we would be little concerned about Hannay's theories except 
from the standpoint of the light they may shed on the direction in which the 
conspiracy may be leading us.  By detailing more brutally than is normal the 
Pagan religion, Hannay may be inadvertently giving us a preview of where our 
own sex- obsessed culture is leading us.  Hannay's account of the disease 
infested "Temple Prostitutes" even raises the specter of the conspiracy's 
reinstitution of the population limiting, and, therefore, ecologically sound, 
promotion of sex as a spiritual sacrament in a new era of fatal, sexually 
transmitted diseases!

The Coming Caesars by Amaury De Riencourt, 1957 Rare out-of-print stock item 
Hardcover, 0384 pages, Order #00432 $37.50

This book created a sensation when it was first released.  Few then or now 
want to apply the word "Empire" or "Imperial" to the nature of America's world
role, a role recently re-demonstrated in Iraq.  Under the barrage of daily
news, America's failures and short-comings take precedence in the minds of
most thinking Americans, creating an "underdog", "persecution complex" mind
set which, conveniently for the "Imperial Conspirators", blinds those without
a firm historical overview to Imperial reality.  Communist overuse of the term
Imperialism in their tired propaganda has also blinded otherwise intelligent
Americans to reality.  It is refreshing to see the term used properly by a
non-communist.  De Riencourt's prejudices, if any, appear to lie in the
direction of "European Culture" or perhaps, covertly, the French,
anti-Anglophile nationalism of Charles DeGaul.  Note: De Riencourt is
especially good in illuminating the similarities of the Imperial roles of
Greece/Rome and Britain/America.

Conscious copying of Roman governmental, legal, and architectural forms by 
America's founding fathers is disturbing in the light of Roman "satanic"
practices of animal sacrifice, torture, blood sports, imperialism, etc.  Is
this book "good history" or simply "National Inquirer" style literature from
another era?  Or, Christian, anti-Pagan propaganda passed off as an original
historical document?

religion and its symbolic remnants in Christianity.  Frightening preview of

A Real Case Against the Jews:  One of Them Points Out the Full Depth of Their 
Guilt by Marcus Eli Ravage, 1928 Xerox, 0012 pages, Order #00428 $7.00

Researchers intrigued by Reuchlin need to know the opposite, competing 
"conspiracy theory" of the "seeding" of the dominant Christian "social 
organism."  Marcus Eli Ravage, a Jewish writer from the 1920's, who worshipped
at the feet of the Rothschilds as their approved biographer, wrote to prove
that Christianity was created by the Jews to destroy the Roman Empire and its
Pagan spirit that prevented Jewish control.  Only after Rome's transformation
by Jesus "meek and mild" could the Jews rise to covert imperium!  Jewish
satire or truth?

Though providing scant evidence for his specific theory that Roman Oligarch 
Piso wrote the New Testament to create a new religion for the Empire that 
would at the same time defeat the growing power of the Jews, it provides
thought exercise for those willing to suspect Machiavellian origins of the 
dominant Christian social organism.  Must reading!

Pagan Christs by J. M. Robertson, 1903  Hardcover, 0171 pages, Order #00438
$30.00

Robertson shows with a certain disturbing persuasiveness that Christianity 
merely borrowed and further "sanitized" the numerous and already mostly
symbolic "human sacrifice" rituals of traditional pagan religions.  Should be
read in conjunction with Reuchlin, Duran, and Ravage in evaluating the theory
that Christianity was consciously seeded to transform humanity for Empire in a
new form.                                      Social Organism Theory

Rupert Sheldrake,   Paperback, 0000 pages, Order #00140 $10.95

is often seen as a heurism for social power organism theory.  Without really
intending to, Sheldrake provides the philosophical, scientific, and biological
theory behind this relatively unknown concept.  Sheldrake also provides an
original framework for analyzing other controversial topics that have so far
eluded the standard materialist reductionism of establishment science
(scientism) such as evolution, consciousness, the occult, ESP, memory, organic
life, etc.

of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America by Michael A. Hoffman II, 1991
Wiswell Ruffin House Paperback, 0086 pages, Order #00501 $5.00

Expanded edition of author's challenging book.  In addition to the obvious use 
to which this book is being put in pro-White circles to counter Black claims 
for quotas and reparations, the question of the conspiracy's real motives in
suppressing and minimizing white slavery through the ages and, in particular,
in colonial America, (through Establishment History) is very effectively
raised.  Will the New World Order be truly "multi-cultural" with the eventual
amalgamation and obliteration of the races or are Whites, and Coloreds too,
being subtly encouraged to remain separate through a laughable false history
which depicts Whites as the only real slavers and Blacks and other races as
the only real slaves in the interests of maintaining an effective "divide and
conquer" system?  This false history of slavery obviously intensifies Black
rage against the entire White Race instead of the tiny ruling class (including
Jews) which benefitted from slavery and continues to rule the world today!
Whites, on the other hand, are encouraged to believe the false notion that
they are and always have been a specially privileged elite.  This leads them
to unconsciously serve as the bodyguard of the conspiracy against the assaults
of enraged "minorities".  This system of manipulation may continue to work
even after Whites are no longer the majority in America!

Conspiracy:  "Also at the (SDS) convention, men from Business International 
Roundtables--the meetings sponsored by Business International for their client

the world's leading industrialists and they convene to decide how our lives 
are going to go.  These are the guys who wrote the alliance for progress.  
They're the left-wing of the ruling class...They offered to finance our 
demonstrations in Chicago...We were also offered Esso (Rockefeller) money.  
They want us to make a lot of radical commotion so they can look more in the 
center as they move to the left."

Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys by Jawanza Kunjufu, 1985 
African American Images Paperback, 0038 pages, Order #00483 $5.00

Radical Afro-American cites, a la Carroll Quigley, the Rhodes-Milner Round 
Table Conspiracy as his source for claiming the conspiracy is essentially a 
white racist conspiracy against people of color.  Claims the entire white race
as well as many subjugated peoples are subtly drawn into the mechanics of
oppression.  The author does not consider the possibility, taken on faith by
most right-wing conspiracy researchers, that the conspiracy has moved beyond
its original racist tactics as it moves toward a cosmopolitan Masonic world
Empire.  This book is quite influential in the current movement for all male,
Afro-centric schools in America's inner cities.

Establishment foundations in seeding and nurturing the revolution for subtle 
reasons of consolidating concentrated economic power and/or for a strategy of 
destruction:  clearing the ground in the service of the "New World Order"!

YES!!I want to receive the Project, the executive summary of the on-going
research of a private network dedicated to applying the scientific method to
conspiracy theories of history.  Current issues of the Project revolve around
clarifying, elaborating, and testing the hypothesis that a traditionally
London-centered world money cartel, under the patronage of the British Crown,
vies for dominion of world affairs on multiple levels with the Vatican, the
Empire of the City(of London)'s ancient enemy and competing social organic
heir to the mantle of Rome.  The Project appears quarterly for social-
political-religious activists, investors, futurologists, students of
geopolitics, students of secret societies and subversion, observers of super-
rich dynasties, students of social organic collective consciousness, and
others who, though not necessarily non-partisan themselves, can benefit from
objective, non-partisan ruling class/conspiracy scholarship.

                                 A Note On Recommended Reading

The books, reports, and articles recommended are not without serious faults
from the point-of-view of the Project.  Most are guilty of blatant partisan
bias, too often on the basis of ideology, religion, race, class, interest
group, etc.  Unfortunately, by its nature, ruling class research is not and
probably never will be solely the province of disinterested scholars. 
However, keep in mind that the bootlicking, lying court historians
cultivate only the appearance of objectivity and, therefore, deserve even
less credit than some of the partisan authors we have recommended.

The Project hypothesis is unique in ruling class-conspiracy literature. 
None of the authors recommended present the Project theory.  The
recommended reading simply contributes facts, research leads, evidence,
testimony, insights, theorizing, and speculation relevant to the Project's
progress toward uncovering the objective nature of the ruling class-
conspiracy or power organism(s).  Do not judge the Project theory by the
readings recommended. We recommend many authors not for objective
information, but for insight into the propaganda of the social power
organism which holds them in thrall. For the evolving Project theory
consult only the Project back issues, especially the August 1985 Issue
($9.00) for the original theory nd the Winter-Spring 1989-90 Issue ($9.00)
for a major revision of working hypothesis.

THE BEGINNING
By John Duran


Doesn't it seem at least slightly suspicious that the New Testament should be
written at a time when Rome was at war with the Jews?  And that the public
"history" that we have from the time is from the winning side.  The Roman
side!

This is the chronological account of not only how history was re- written, but 
also why the New Testament was written, and by whom, and how, and for what
purpose.  This tells the "real" history of biblical times between 19 C.E. and
192 C.E.

First, know that there is a hidden war going on, it is now in progress, and it 
is the result of the conspiracy that was initiated back in the first century
C.E.

A partial list of the original conspirators include: Lucius A.  Seneca, Galba, 
Pliny the Younger, Lucius Calpurnius Piso* Caesoninus), Arrius Calpurnius Piso 
(A.K.A. "Flavius Josephus"), Vespasian, Titus (Vespasian's son), Justus 
Calpurnius Piso (A.K.A. "Justin Martyr").

The same name as the Lucius Piso whose daughter married Julius Caesar - Lucius
Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus.  That earlier Lucius Piso was in fact, also a
Caesar!  He was Julius Caesar's father's brother (That's right, his uncle!).
And Lucia Calpurnia Piso was his first cousin.  Marc Antony was Julius
Caesar's 2nd uncle.

Now, I will fill you in on some of the pertinent factors and motives of the
time.  There were many battles fought between the Romans and the Jews, on the
field, and on paper - through propaganda.

Why? Well, for one thing, the Roman aristocratic way of life was at stake.  It
was one in which slavery played a major part.  The Roman way of life was one
based on power and control; the control of other people.  The Jewish way of
life was not tolerant of slavery, because it went against the humanistic
teachings of Hillel the Pharisee.  After the death of King Herod, the Herodian
Priests were losing control of the Jewish masses, because of this new
Pharisaic Party of Humanistic Jews.

Philippians 3:12  "Be all of you subject one to another, having your
conversion "honest" among the Gentiles" At first, they tried to give this new
religion to the Jews (new wine in old bottles), but when the Jews wouldn't
accept it, they went to give it to the Gentiles (new wine in new bottles), and
destroy the Jews.  The proportion of Jews (Jewish Beth Hillel,
zealots/Pharisees), in the Roman empire by the late 50's C.E. was over 20%.
As humanistic Jews, they were a threat to the Roman way of life, i.e.,
aristocratic.  So, a few conspirators in the hierarchy decided to give the
Jews a new religion - Christianity.

They synthesized this new religion, and based it upon the already existent
Jewish religion, and using the Jewish books, they customized it to fit the
Roman way of life.

The New Testament books were written after the supposed fact, so that it was
easy for them to be self-fulfilling.  The first "Christian" book written was
"Ur Marcus", which was the prototype for the book "Mark" that was written by
Arrius Piso.

"Ur Marcus" was written by Lucius (Lucillius) Calpurnius Caesoninus Piso in 
about the year 60 C.E. (Perhaps closer to the year 62 C.E.).  Even theologians 
agree that chronologically "Mark" would come before "Matthew".  The main 
conspirators at this time included: Seneca, Galba, Lucius Piso, Gaius Piso, 
and Seneca's nephew "Lucan the Poet".  Arrius Piso was 28 years old in 65 C.E.

The book "Ur Marcus" was given to the Jews, who soon rejected it.  Of course, 
they maintained a company of their own private slaves which they used as 
scribes to make copies of their books to distribute to the masses, after which 
the slaves were killed.  This practice was copied after the Egyptian Pharaohs' 
practice of killing the slaves who worked on the inner-chamber of the 
Pyramids.  For, these slaves also worked on the inner-circle of the "triangle"
(the new trinity).  Next, the book "Ur Marcus" was given to slaves and
gentiles, who bought it hook, line, and sinker.

This new group of followers were called "Gentile Christians", or non-Jewish 
Christians.  In 66 C.E., Arrius Piso deliberately provoked the Jewish revolt
so that he could pave the way to destroying the Temple because the Jews were
not accepting his Uncle's story "Ur Marcus", which was intended to pacify the
Jews.

About the year 70, Lucius Piso wrote another book called "Ur Matthias" (the 
two books that went to the Logia, "Ur Marcus" and "Ur Matthias" were written
by Lucius Piso).  Lucius Piso died in the year 73 C.E., that was when Arrius
Piso inherited his works.

By the year 70, Arrius Piso and Titus' army had destroyed the Temple in 
Jerusalem.  Somewhere between the year 70 and 75, Arrius Piso re-wrote his 
Uncle's books and gave his Uncle's fictional messiah the name "Jesus".  It was
Arrius Piso who thought to name the character "Jesus", because it was Joseph
(Josephus) who was the father of the fictional Jesus in the story.  Now, when
writing the books of the New Testament, Arrius borrowed the characteristics
for his characters from earlier prototypes.  The character for Jesus and even
the concept of the trinity, was borrowed from the already ancient Egyptian
equivalent of the Holy family.  Osiris/Joseph - the father who is a lesser god
than the son;  Isis/Mary - the virgin mother;  and their son Horus, who was
the equivalent of Jesus (they even made a "Horus-Caesar" as a joke in Egypt,
Ref. "The Nile", Emil Ludwig, pg. 417 ).

Also, some of the characteristics used to create the Jesus character and some 
of the "sayings" that they used, were borrowed from Hillel the Pharisee.  This
was all too obvious to the Jews, and especially to the Rabbis of the day, who
for the most part, were relatives (descendants) of Hillel (Beth Hillel).
These same were also relatives (distant?) of the Pisos, for they also were
descendants of King David.

Arrius Piso used "Hercules" to contribute the following attributes and 
characteristics to his Jesus character: 1. The "Prince of Peace" title, 2. The 
virgin mother, 3. a father who was a god,... and 4. he too was "the only 
begotten son" of his "god father" (father, god), 5. Hercules too was called 
"savior", and 6. had the title "the good shepherd", and 7., Hercules also died 
and went for a brief visit to hell (Hades), after which, he then ascended to 
Heaven (the heavens).

By 75 C.E., Arrius Piso had revised the book "Ur Marcus" and we now know that 
book as the book "Mark" of the New Testament.  Of course, with all of these 
things going on, and with new conspirators on the rise, the conspirators 
didn't want to attract any suspicion, but at the same time, they needed a 
system in which they could not only keep track of their own material 
(propaganda), but also keep their identities secret, yet still be able to 
claim authorship - for both prosperity and their own egos.

2:2, The Epistles of Paul the Apostle to Seneca (Anneas Seneca, d. 65 C.E.); 
"For you know when, and by whom, at what seasons, and to whom I must deliver
every thing which I send", (ref.  Apocryphal New Testament).

The fact of the matter is, that Seneca did not live long enough to see any 
other "Christian" books or paraphernalia except "Ur Marcus" - the prototype 
for the book "Mark".  The Epistles of Paul the Apostle were written by Justus
Calpernius Piso, and realizing this, it would also be realized that Seneca had
long been departed.  Justus didn't start writing until the late 90's C.E.,
when he helped his dad and Pliny write "Acts of the Apostles".

Now that you have been briefed on the background of the conspiracy, here is a 
chronological synopsis.  Germanicus Caesar was the nephew and adopted son of
the Roman Emperor Tiberius.  Germanicus was born in 15 B.C.E., and died in 19
C.E., when he was poisoned by Cnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the Governor of Syria.

Cnaeus C. Piso was the father of Gaius, Marcus, & Lucius Calpurnius Piso.  
Cnaeus died in 20 C.E.  Gaius Calpurnius Piso was the father of Arrius
Calpurnius Piso a.k.a. Flavius Josephus.

The Pisos were Romans and Arrius was also technically a Jew by descent because 
his mother was a Jew (or rather, a descendant of the Jewish hierarchy), his
mother was Mariam (Arria the Younger) the Great-Granddaughter of King Herod
the Great.  Arrius C. Piso was born in the year 37 C.E.  The Younger Arria was
the daughter of Arria the Elder who was the wife of Caecina Paetus.  Caecina
Paetus was involved in a conspiracy of Scribonianus' against the Emperor
Claudius in 42 C.E., and was condemned to death.  Paetus' wife, Arria, did not
wish to survive him and took her life with him - by dagger.  The Younger Arria
found herself in the same situation in the year 65 C.E. with her husband
Thrasea Paetus (Gaius Piso), but her husband begged her to live for the sake
of their children.  Philo of Alexandria died about 45 C.E., and Philo
mentioned Pilate in connection with the incident concerning the Roman shields,
but he did not, nor could he, make any mention of Jesus or the Christian story
(the works of "Philo" are suspect also).  If, he was a real person other than
Arrius Piso, he was a relative of Arrius Piso through the Herods of Judea.

"Philo" mentioned "Pilate", not "Pontius" Pilate, because "Pontius" was added 
to the name later, as Pliny was helping Arrius write "Luke".  Arrius Piso 
honored Pliny by adding the name "Pontius" as a variant of the name of the 
Province in which Pliny was in charge-Pontus.  So, that gave Pliny the 
nickname "Pontius".

In and around the year 55 C.E., Rome started feeling the pressure of the new
humanistic, anti-slavery, Pharisaic Jewish Party upon the aristocratic Roman
lifestyle. During the years between 55 and 62, the Pisos' popularity and
family status had once again risen to a very high aristocratic level amongst
those Patriotic Romans (and the Jewish hierarchy), who wanted to preserve that
hallowed Roman institution of slavery.  And along with Seneca, Galba, and a
host of others, the Pisos were likened to heros by a majority of influential
and powerful Romans.  In about the year 60, Lucius Calpurnius Piso wrote "Ur
Marcus" - the prototype for the book "Mark" (which was later to be re-written
by Arrius Piso). During the following four years, Lucius, Seneca, Persius the
Poet, and miscellaneous other conspirators tried to get Nero to assist them in
their plan to give the people a new religion to help preserve the Roman
institution of slavery and regain control of the masses through religion (by
which they could then easily manipulate them through the use of rhetoric and
spuriously synthesized ideologies).

But these conspirators were thoroughly surprised to find that after giving
Nero the details of their plan - he opposed it!  Nero opposed the plan because
his mistress at the time (who later became his wife), Poppea, was of the
pro-Jewish Pharisaic Party.  So, Gaius and Lucius Piso and their group planned
to assassinate Nero in the year 65 C.E.  The attempt failed because Milichus
told Nero about the plot in the hopes of receiving a large reward, but Nero
was so shook with sudden terror that he mistook Milichus' greed for loyalty.
Nero started questioning all of the conspirators that Milichus named, they in
turn named even more.

Gaius Piso was put to death in his own home (remember, this is Thrasea Paetus,
and he was at home with his wife Arria the Younger).  He committed suicide as
ordered, so that his family would not lose their holdings to the state.  This
order of suicide came from Nero to Gaius Piso just after Piso had been
nominated senatorial successor that year.  Seneca (Nero's rhetoric teacher),
and Seneca's nephew Lucan, Barea Soranus, Faenius Rufus, and miscellaneous
others were executed by Nero.  Nero exiled  Gaius' son, Arrius, to Syria,
where he stationed him as Governor (just as Arrius' Grandfather Cnaeus Piso
had been Governor of Syria also).  Nero could not kill such a powerful figure
as his relative Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, because he was the name
sake of the earlier Roman Hero whose daughter married Julius Caesar.  So,
Lucius Piso, one of the main conspirators, escaped with his life.  Nero
allowed this only to prevent a uprising.  Lucius Piso married his dead
brother's wife, and adopted Arrius Piso.  Nero still went about weeding out
conspirators.

Nero executed Gaius Petronius Arbiter in 66, as a conspirator of Piso's.  And 
in that same year, Arrius Piso    deliberately provoked a Jewish revolt - so 
he would have an excuse to destroy the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem.  But Arrius 
wouldn't be able to do that until the year 70, when he would have the help of 
Titus' Army (inner-circle source for the phrase "you and what army"?).  In 67, 
Nero ordered his probably loyal relative General  Corbulo (also an Ahenobarbii 
like Nero through his father, in fact, Corbulo may have been Nero's Uncle), to 
commit suicide, as  he also was suspected to be a conspirator of Piso.  Arrius 
Piso finally succeeded in assassinating Nero by having Nero's slave 
Epaphroditus do it for him (actually, this Epaphroditus was probably Arrius 
Piso himself.  I will explain this further later), in 68 C.E., Galba then 
became Emperor and named Arrius' cousin, Licinianus Frugi Piso, as his 
intended successor.

On January 1st of the year 69 C.E., Lower Germany declared Aulus Vitellius
legate of that Province.  Licinianus Piso was killed along with Galba in Rome
during an uprising of soldiers put into action by Otho on January 15th.
Licinianus Piso lived four days longer than Galba, and so, was Emperor of Rome
for those four days.  Otho had taken Poppea, Nero's widow to be his wife and
was Emperor after Piso.  Then, Otho was forced to kill himself after being
defeated by Vitellius, who was then killed by an uprising of soldiers - staged
by Arrius Piso in order to secure Vespasian's position as new Emperor.  All of
this in the year 69 C.E.  Why would Arrius Piso want Vespasian to be the new
Emperor?  Arrius Calpernius Piso was the grandson of Vespasian's own brother!

Because T. Flavius Sabinus 2 (Vespasian's brother, where Arrius gets the 
"Flavius" in his "Flavius Josephus" name), was married to the elder Arria, 
Arrius Piso's Grandmother!  So, the Emperor Vespasian was Arrius Piso's 
Grand-Uncle!  The year 70 C.E. saw the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, 
where many thousands of Jews were killed by Titus' and Piso's army.  And about 
that year (or more probably year 71), Lucius Piso wrote his second book, the 
logia "Ur Matthias".  In the year 71, Titus issued his infamous "Captive 
Judea" coin.  And in the year 73, as a Roman General, Arrius Piso and his Army 
destroyed the last three Jewish outposts - Machaerus, Herodian and Mesada.  It 
was in this year that Lucius Piso was killed, supposedly "accidentally" by 
Arrius Piso himself.  Arrius Piso then starts re-writing his Uncles' books.  
Arrius Piso has the original copies translated from his Uncles' Latin 
versions, into Greek, and even though Arrius had altered them slightly, they 
still contain a strong hint of Latin influence.  So, about the year 75, the 
new versions of "Mark" and "Matthew" appear.  79 was the year of the eruption 
of Mt.  Vesuvius at the Bay of Naples, which buried the cities of Pompeii and 
Herculanem.  Pliny the Younger, and his Uncle (the Elder Pliny), saw the 
eruption and tried to save some of their family members (and books) who were 
caretakers of Lucius Piso's library at Herculanem.  The Elder Pliny lost his 
life there at the Bay of Naples, but even though they managed to take some
books, they left about 800 of them behind (which is an estimate made by the
most studious D. Comporetti).

Excavations show that there was a quantity Epicurean Philosophic papyrus in
both Greek and Latin, but the vast  majority of the papyri was written in
Latin (which was Lucius Piso's main language).  Some of the Greek papyrus was
originally from the library of their ancestor and Epicurean philosopher -
Philodemus of Gadara.  In the year 80, a severe fire was supposed  to have
occured in Rome.  And in the year 84, Pliny the Younger officially became a
member of the immediate Piso family by his marriage to Arrius Piso's
granddaughter "Calpurnia" (this, according to my earlier notes.  However,
Pliny was already related, at least semi-distantly).  During the year 85, both
Arrius and Pliny the Younger together wrote the New Testament book "Luke".
And in the year 90, Arrius started writing the "Jewish Antiquities" under his
pen name of "Flavius Josephus".

Arrius Piso's sister Fannia, who was infamous for the number of times in which 
she had been banished, came back to Rome with her mother - Arria the younger
(the widow of "Thrasea Paetus" a.k.a.  Gaius Piso.  Fannia was banished again
in 93 (under Domitian), and her property was confiscated.  Also, in 93,
Suetonius came to live with his grandfather - Arrius Piso!  When Suetonius'
father Rufus died in 93, Arrius brought Suetonius (in "history" under the
names "Arrius Verus" and "Titus Antonius"), into his home.  Suetonius was the
son of Arrius Piso's daughter Claudia Phoebe Pompeia Plotina Calpurnia Pisa
(Piso).

In the year 95, Alexander, Arrius Piso's first son (who was the father of
Pliny's wife Calpurnia), died.  Also, in that year, Flavius Clemens, a first
cousin of the Emperor Domitian, was executed on a charge of "atheism".  Many
have wondered just what was meant by this.  Remember who "God" was?  Caesar!
So, to say that there was no God, was to denounce Caesar - who just happened
to be "Domitian" at the time.  Then in 96, Piso (Arrius) and Pliny
assassinated Domitian, who was the second son and last main surviver of
Vespasian.  The "Dynamic Duo" (Arrius & Pliny) were assisted in the
assassination by "Stephanus" (Remember the martyr of Stephan, 1st Cor. 1:16),
who was the slave of the Emperor's niece "Domitilla".  Then, they appointed
the Elderly Nerva Emperor, because he would allow the Pisos to do anything
that they liked.  He ruled for two years and died of natural causes.

Also, in 96, Piso started writing his "Vita" while helping his son, Fabius 
Justus (Justin Martyr) Calpurnius Piso and Pliny  the Younger write "Acts of 
the Apostles" (which they finished about the year 100).  In 98, when Nerva 
died, Trajan became Emperor.  Trajan was Arrius Piso's son-in-law.  He was 
married to Claudia Phoebe Pompeia Plotina Piso.  Martial, their relative,  
wrote about their marriage.  Because Piso's daughter was  Emperoress, she was 
allowed to write an actual portion of the New Testament, because remember, the 
New Testament was "THE BOOK OF  LIFE" itself!

She wrote the last part of "Romans".  That was the year 100, when her brother 
Proculus was writing "Romans".  Pliny started writing "1st Corinthians", 
"Galatians", and "Ephesians", finishing those books in the year 103.  Also in 
the year 100, Pliny was starting up the first churches in Pontus and Bithynia.  
Now the Piso family really kicks into high gear!  Between the years 100-105, 
Pliny writes "Titus" and starts writing epistles as "St. Ignatius" (he wrote 
epistles to the churches that he started up!).  Can you picture this?  Such
was how Christianity was started.  And Julius Piso wrote an epistle as
"Clement of Rome", Proculus, as "St. Polycarp".  In the year 105, Justus
writes the "Gospel of John".

Justus wrote "Timothy 2" in 107 C.E., while helping his son Julianus, and his 
nephew Silanus, to write "Thessalonians" 1 & 2, which they finished writing 
around 110 C.E.  During that time, Justus and Julianus also wrote "Philemon",
and Justus finished up "James" by himself in 110.  Between the years 110 and
115, Proculus Piso and Julius Piso were the family writers.  Proculus was
writing "Peter" 1 & 2, and Julius was writing "John" 1, 2 and 3, and "Jude".
By the end of 115, all of the books of the New Testament were written, except
"Revelations" and "Hebrews".

Pliny the Younger, playing the part of "Paul" in Titus 1:12, quotes
"Epimenides the Cretan" saying; "All Cretans are liars".  That is, a Cretan
(Greek) saying that all Cretans are liars.  Why would Pliny say this in the
first place?  Because he was teasing at the fact that the Pisos were liars
descended from the Greeks, and in fact, directly descended from the brother of
Alexander the Great (his brother's name was "Lagos" which means "The Rabbit").

Note: There is a noted similarity found in the Lord's Prayer (written by 
Arrius Piso), and Philo of Alexandria (Purportedly, the chief Rabbi of
Alexandria, Egypt); "If you ask pardon for "your" sins ("sins?") do you also
forgive those who have trespassed against "you"?  For, (in this), remission is
granted for remission."  The "remission of sins" sounds familiar.  So does
"forgive those whom have trespassed".  Sounds a lot like that old devil
himself, Arrius Piso!  Also, Philo of Alexandria was supposed to have died
around the year 45 C.E., the Jews didn't start calling teachers "Rabbi" until
after the year 70!


THE "SON" COMETH!

Matt. 4:3; "If thou art (the) son of God, speak, that these stones may turn to 
loaves (of bread)."  He then smartly answers his own remark in Matt. 4:4, 
saying; "Man does not live by bread alone."

Later, in Matt. 7:9, he says; "Or what man is there of you who, if his son 
should ask (for) bread, will give him a stone?"  This is said again in Luke
4:3.  And in 1st Peter 2:4; "To whom coming, (as) a living stone, is indeed
rejected by men."  For more on this, see "Revelations Exposed".




"Beginnings" is the introduction to John Duran's book, The Origins of 
Christianity, which can be obtained for $5.00 from Duran Releases, PO Box 227,
Pomona, CA 91769.  Of course, we also recommend reading Abelard Reuchlin's The
True Authorship of the New Testament ($5.00 in-stock) on the same theme.

Interested researchers need to know the opposite, compteting "conspiracy" 
theory of the "seeding" of the Christian "social organism."  Marcus Eli
Ravage, a Jewish writer from the 1920's who worshiped at the feet of the
Rothschilds, wrote A Real Case Against the Jews to prove that Christianity was
created by Jews to destroy the Roman Empire and the robust Pagan spirit that
prevented Jewish control of Pagan society.  Only with the Pagans transformed
under Jesus "meek and mild" could the Jews rise to covert world imperium!

~MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
YES!!I want to receive the Project, the executive summary of the on-going
research of a private network dedicated to applying the scientific method to
conspiracy theories of history.  Current issues of the Project revolve around
clarifying, elaborating, and testing the hypothesis that a traditionally
London-centered world money cartel, under the patronage of the British Crown,
vies for dominion of world affairs on multiple levels with the Vatican, the
Empire of the City(of London)'s ancient enemy and competing social organic
heir to the mantle of Rome.  The Project appears quarterly for social-
political-religious activists, investors, futurologists, students of
geopolitics, students of secret societies and subversion, observers of super-
rich dynasties, students of social organic collective consciousness, and
others who, though not necessarily non-partisan themselves, can benefit from
objective, non-partisan ruling class/conspiracy scholarship.

                                 A Note On Recommended Reading

The books, reports, and articles recommended are not without serious faults
from the point-of-view of the Project.  Most are guilty of blatant partisan
bias, too often on the basis of ideology, religion, race, class, interest
group, etc.  Unfortunately, by its nature, ruling class research is not and
probably never will be solely the province of disinterested scholars. 
However, keep in mind that the bootlicking, lying court historians
cultivate only the appearance of objectivity and, therefore, deserve even
less credit than some of the partisan authors we have recommended.

The Project hypothesis is unique in ruling class-conspiracy literature. 
None of the authors recommended present the Project theory.  The
recommended reading simply contributes facts, research leads, evidence,
testimony, insights, theorizing, and speculation relevant to the Project's
progress toward uncovering the objective nature of the ruling class-
conspiracy or power organism(s).  Do not judge the Project theory by the
readings recommended. We recommend many authors not for objective
information, but for insight into the propaganda of the social power
organism which holds them in thrall. For the evolving Project theory
consult only the Project back issues, especially the August 1985 Issue
($9.00) for the original theory nd the Winter-Spring 1989-90 Issue ($9.00)
for a major revision of working hypothesis.

Black Paranoia on the Rise
Conspiracy Theories Abound!


      By now, few readers can have missed noticing the growth of the "Black 
paranoia" phenomenon, an outgrowth of the more extreme forms of "Afrocentrism" 
that inform it.  It has been covered, "with concern", in all the major media 
including Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, and network news.  It has also 
been covered from varying perspectives in Black media such as Emerge, Ebony, 
Class, Essence, etc.  Under the pressures of decreasing opportunities and 
increasing desperation in a deteriorating economy, the "crack cocaine plague", 
the Black underclass crime epidemic, and AIDS plague that are ravaging so many 
formerly stable, if deprived, Black communities, many Blacks are coming to 
believe in a White Conspiracy to destroy, rather than "just" dominate, 
exploit, discriminate against, and oppress, the Blacks and other non-Whites in 
America and around the world.  Often drawing on Birch Society, Liberty Lobby, 
and LaRouche materials, as well as left-wing socialist ruling class authors, 
many have fingered the "Global 2000" project of the "White dominated" Council 
on Foreign Relations as the "public face" of the conspiracy.  Black conspiracy 
theorists uniformly suspect that AIDS is an artificial disease specifically 
designed by the White Power Structure to destroy people of color and that 
crack cocaine is purposely allowed to flood the Black-Hispanic ghettos.  Note: 
Most "responsible" Black publications and leaders have warned against 
conspiratorial excesses which may tend to rationalize failure.

      Those wishing to "get up to speed" with the state of Black conspiracy 
theory should consult the books listed and reviewed under "Race" in this 
issue.  While stipulating that much of the Black oriented recommended 
literature goes overboard in glorifying Black cultures and emphasizing the 
Black input to multi-cultural Egypt, there are important germs of truth that 
provide excellent antidotes for the admittedly symmetrically, White-biased 
conspiracy theories which have, until now, formed the bulk of our "recommended 
reading".  Remember that all our recommended reading is selected only for the
germs of truth, theory, and speculation provided, not for the biased overview
and social organism building, propaganda message.


Paradox in the Black Theories


      Few conspiracy theorists would dispute the nearly universal Black
conspiracy theory that the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to rule the world descends
from the Egyptian Occult Theocracy (See our review of James' The Stolen Legacy
and turn over the $1.00 bill in your wallet!)  Never do the Black conspiracy
theorists ask if this is the source of today's evil, but only talk of how this
(evil?) system was stolen by White barbarian Greeks from Black Egyptians!
James even details and admits how the Egyptian Priesthood ruled (oppressed)
the ignorant masses through awe and kept their embryonic science and
philosophy secret in a rigidly guarded Mystery System ruled by the Pharaoh
through his theocracy of occult priests.  James seems to condone this
obviously oppressive system and condemn the Greeks who gained access to the
Pharaoh's priesthood under false pretenses of loyalty only to plagiarize and
bring the secrets into the public domain as "Greek Philosophy".  James never
examines the obvious thesis that the Greeks,

even if not very original thinkers, created the basis for the superiority of
Classical Western Civilization and eventually the unprecedented Industrial
Revolution by bringing science and philosophy to the masses of Europe who
happened to be White.  Whose fault was it that the Black masses of Africa were
denied such access to the power or reason, science, and technology for
thousands of years?  This depends on whether you think the Egyptian ruling
classes, prior to the Greek Ptolemy Dynasty, were primarily White or Black!


White Conspiracy or White Social Organism?


      Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's The Isis Papers, to the extent that the 
Project theories of social organism through "morphic resonance" give credence 
to her "White collective unconscious", neo-Jungian approach, cannot but give 
pause to regular Project readers.  Not all the subtle psychological mechanisms 
of the White "need to discriminate and oppress" this Black psychiatrist 
postulates are absurd (though many are!).

      In profound ways, Welsing's ideology presents of mirror image of the 
extreme White racist theories she hates.  In spots, especially where she 
identifies Semites as "semi-Whites" to explain White the animus toward Jews, 
she can even be accused of "cribbing" from White racist authors.  (She is 
apparently unaware that the word Semite refers to Noah'~ son Shem, not the 
prefix "semi"!)  Her theory that melanin (skin pigment) has mental effects 
that make Blacks more sensitive emotionally and spiritually (have more "soul") 
and that Whites (albinos), secretly fearful of Black superiority, 
over-compensate for their mental defect through compulsive cerebral activity, 
especially as applied to the technology of power and domination over people of 
color, is really equivalent to the White racist idea that Whites are 
inherently mentally superior to the more "physical" and "emotional" Blacks.  
The extremity of Dr. Welsing's theories even raises a question as to whether 
she is consciously or subconsciously joining in the application of a Judo-Move 
to her own race as described below.  I can think of no ideology more tailored 
to rationalize keeping Blacks where they are or even sliding further 
backwards!  Her book is disturbingly popular and well advertised in Black 
publications.

~DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD~
Aside:  Speaking of the racial "collective unconscious", we just noticed that
"a-albionic" could just as well mean "non-White" as "non-British"!  Albion
means White in Latin.  Most think it was applied to Britain's White cliffs of
Dover, not the color of her people's skin--but who knows?--the Romans were
darker skinned than the English!

Is the Ruling Class/Conspiracy White Racist?


      As those who have followed the Project theory since 1984 can readily 
appreciate, the essence of these Black conspiracy theories, ie. that the 
ruling class/conspiracy is essentially White Racist, is not easily disproved.  
After all, Lord Milner, the secret society Round Tabler par excellence and 
right-hand man of Cecil Rhodes, identified himself openly as a "race 
nationalist"!  Cecil Rhodes in his will stated:  "It is the destiny of the 
pure Aryan Anglo-Saxon race to dominate the world and kill off or else reduce 
to servile status all other inferior races."  "White Man's Burden", the 
"public-face", semi-official ideology of the British Empire popularized by 
Rudyard Kipling and from which the current conspiracy descends, was a 
transparent rationalization for White domination of the world under the color 
of patronizing of non-Whites as inherently inferior or at least historically  
and culturally undeveloped.  In nearly all theories, those suspected of being 
the "top conspirators" are all light skinned from the Aryan-rooted British 
Royal family to Rockefeller, Rothschild, and George Bush.  Certainly, few dark 
faces are seen at the top of the Vatican hierarchy.  Those near or at the top 
of the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy may or may not be Jewish, but they are not, as 
far as anyone can tell, Black, Oriental, Native American, Mongols, etc.  To 
often, we Whites forget how anomalous the world situation is from a non-White 
perspective.  With less than 10% of the world population, Whites some how hold 
the bulk of world power.  Only the Japanese are seriously challenging this 
White supremacy.

      We must consider the possibility that the "multi- culturalism" currently 
promoted by the conspiracy through the universities and the mass media, like 
"White Man's Burden" before it, may be a veil, albeit a less transparent one, 
to hide an essentially racist policy and strategy of the conspiracy as more 
candidly described by Cecil Rhodes or, at least, a "new culture, Brave New 
World" policy that subtly favors Whites.  Too many White conspiracy theorist, 
with the exception of LaRouche, take on faith the theory that the conspiracy 
is working for amalgamation of the races through its much vaunted "multi-
cultural" programs and, hereby, for the eventual destruction of the White
race.

      White conspiracy theorists, themselves often racial/ethnic or religious 
chauvinist-collectivists, see those with White Christians roots as encouraged 
to renounce or soft-pedal their cultural heritage to make way for a 
"mongrelized" multi-cultural future.  They fear cultural obliteration as a
result of increasing non-White/non-Christian racial-cultural identity
consciousness while White racial-cultural identity consciousness decreases.
They over-look that the increasingly shrill, chauvinist, multi-cultural
demands increase White unity and separatism automatically, not based on
outmoded historical- ethnic-religious concepts pursued by other "primitive"
races, but based on a "scientific-technological" culture of the future and the
perception that only a fraction of Whites and a smaller fraction of the less
developed minority populations are capable of such an "advanced" perspective
that severs and leaves behind obsolete cultural roots!  The idea that Whites
should drop their cultural chauvinism and "understand" the increasing
chauvinism of other races and cultures is proof positive that the ruling
class/conspiracy considers Whites potentially superior or, at least, more
capable of assimilating and leading the coming New World Order culture.


Clearing the Way for the New World Order

      What White-biased conspiracy theorists overlook is the probable Olympian 
perspective of the Judeo-Masonic conspiracy which identifies all 
racial-cultural heritages as absurd and headed for the scrap-heap in their 
up-coming high tech New World Order and that Whites, including liberal Jews, 
will form the core of this new, scientific culture of the future!  Thus, we 
see toleration and promotion of "multi-culturalism" as a clever "Judo-Move" by 
the conspiracy against any and all humans who crave a collective identity 
based on race or cultural heritage instead of the new culture of reason 
projected for the New World Order.  Such misfits are subtly encouraged to 
separate themselves from the coming New World Order through chauvinist 
racial/ethnic collectivist ideas and suffer the consequences which, as 
demonstrated by Black males who have rejected education with a high frequency, 
can be quite severe indeed.

      To the extent that, due to historical circumstances and the duplicitous 
current promotion of non-White cultural heritage, a higher proportion of 
non-Whites than Whites will be destroyed or submerged by the conspiracy's 
"Cultural Judo" strategy, it might be justifiable to identify the conspiracy 
as racist.  On the other hand, a la Star Trek, we can probably expect that the 
small minority of non-Whites that reject their heritage in favor of New World 
Order culture will be accepted by the conspiracy.  (Now we know why such a 
small per cent of the Starship Enterprise "crew of the future" is non-White 
when the Earth is now 90% plus non- White.)  From this perspective, it might 
be more accurate to identify the conspiracy as non-racist, but incredibly 
ruthless in its strategy to build its new world culture of reason and destroy 
all traces of "natural" or "historical" world cultures.  This ruthlessness has 
probably been adopted primarily because it dovetails nicely with the 
conspiracy's view that the world population is far too large and must be 
reduced drastically for ecological reasons.  But are they really serious about 
population reduction?  And, if so, can they really achieve it.  So far, in 
spite of all the anti-life strategies of which they are accused, they are
making no apparent progress in slowing down population growth except among
some "advanced" Whites!

      Here at the Project we have always identified the conspiracy as 
essentially Judeo-Masonic/Royalist worshipers of reason and science (including 
occult science) and only incidentally racist (See the May-June 1985 issue, 
page 2, paragraph 2).  The overt, primary racism of the Rhodes-Milner Round
Table conspiracy has been seen by the Project as cleverly encouraged from the
commanding heights of the Judeo-Masonic/Royalist conspiracy to manipulate
Whites into serving as "warriors for the conspiracy" based on the "false
pride" of race, during the now passed British Empire-"White Man's Burden",
conquest phase of the conspiracy.  ("The sun never set on a British soldier
dying for the Empire.") As the current consolidation of power phase of the
ruling class/conspiracy progresses, however, while Whites are again being
accorded a special role, they will serve in a more subdued fashion as a
"beleaguered" minority "bodyguard" of the mostly White conspiracy, as leaders
of the "new culture" of reason, as "pained" implementers of "hard choices" for
the rest of humanity, and as implementers of the, in effect if not in
intention, genocidal ecology program.


New World Order or New Dark Age?

      An alternative theory which must be considered by the Project is the 
idea that multi-culturalism is promoted by the conspiracy merely to further 
its familiar "divide and conquer" strategy.  (See Dr. Emanuel Josephson's 
books for the theory that the conspiracy is working for Caesarism rationalized 
by artificially stimulated ethnic/racial strife.)  According to this theory, 
rather than viewing multi-culturalism as a clever plot to pave the way for an 
ecologically sound, Brave New World, rational, Promethean culture of science 
and technology for their New World Order, the ruling class/conspiracy is 
simply struggling at all costs to maintain its own power organism at the 
expense of a developing American and other national/regional cultural unities 
and the New World Order is simply a futile self-delusion with which they 
rationalize their destructive program to each other and their kept 
intellectuals.  According to this theory, a true American and even world 
culture was being forged in the "melting pot" of modernism until the 
conspiracy re-introduced and/or promoted divisive ethic chauvinism.

      As shown by the Republicans' "Willie Horton" strategy and symmetrical 
Democratic policies around envy, destructive "divide and conquer" strategies 
are at least a necessary short-run strategy for ruling class operators 
regardless of their "idealistic" dreams, if any.  If the shiny goal of an 
ecologically sound, sustainable, low-population world society is either not 
achievable, a ruling class self-delusion, or a conscious fraud, the 
much-feared New World Order, Brave New World culture will never materialize.  
Instead, the conspiracy's constant need to "divide and conquer" we will land
us in a New Dark Age of misery and hate.


Who Is H. Ross Perot?

      Needless-to-say, we do not accept the idea that Ross Perot is an
unconnected "independent".  In our March 1986 Project we pointed-out that
Prince Charles awarded Mr. Perot the prestigious gold medallion of the Winston
Churchill of the United States Foundation.  There is every reason to suspect
that Mr. Perot represents the Crown in their well-known high-tech investment
strategy/business empire.  Margaret Thatcher and the late "Skull and Bones
Godfather", W. Averell Harriman, all well known tools of the Queen's "Empire
of the City", have also received the award.  The awards banquet was called
"truly an Anglo-American evening" by Prince Charles who was especially
gratified by the orchestra's rendition of Rule Britannia!  Is Perot a modern
Andrew Carnegie?

      After taking a chunk out of General Motors for the Crown (though failing 
to discipline the floundering management of that traditionally City connected 
behemoth) Mr. Perot seems to be functioning as the Crown's "Ace in the Hole" 
for the coming election.  Elected either as a Democrat or as an Independent, 
Mr.  Perot could well become the Crown's "Man on Horseback" to put their New 
World Order in high gear.  More likely, he will serve as pressure and 
rationalization for Bush to move away from his unwanted alliance with the 
Catholic, pro-Life Movement, and other Reagan remnants and impediments to the 
New World Order.

       Others have suggested that the Perot threat will be used by the Israeli 
Lobby to move the Bush-Baker team away from their strategy of reeling-in 
Israeli chauvinism.

Race Based Theories

Black Man of the Nile:  And His Family by Dr. Yosef A. A.  ben-Jochannan, 1972 
In Print Paperback, 0380 pages, Order #00560 $24.95

Working from the premises of James' Stolen Legacy the author of this book 
supplies abundant historical data and interpretation with the goal of
restoring the military-political-intellectual reputation of Black African
civilizations that preceded Western Civilization.  Candidly, or even with
pride, the author admits that African civilizations shared the
"militarist-imperialist" nature of Western civilizations, but claims the
racist rationalizations were absent.  Malcolm X:  The FBI File--With An
Introduction By Spike Lee by Clayborne Carson, 1991 In Print Paperback, 0514
pages, Order #00484 $12.95

This book may give insight into Spike Lee's up-coming movie on Malcolm X, a 
movie bound to have very significant influence.  The book consists mainly of 
Freedom of Information documents garnered from the FBI with comments and 
analysis.  The documents do not point to harassment and opposition as 
obviously as Spike Lee and the author would have us believe though the 
monitoring was certainly intense.  Doesn't mention the possibility that 
Malcolm was used to "bring down" Elijah Muhammad and the Black Muslims who 
were considered very dangerous.  We did he meet with the King of Saudi Arabia, 
a US ally!

They Were White and They Were Slaves:  The Untold History of the Enslavement 
of Whites in Early America by Michael A. Hoffman II, 1991 In Print Paperback, 
0086 pages, Order #00501 $5.00

Expanded edition of the author's challenging book.  In addition to the obvious 
use to which this book is being put in pro-White circles to counter Black
claims for quotas and reparations, the question of the conspiracy's real
motives through Establishment History in suppressing and minimizing white
slavery through the ages and, in particular, in colonial America, is very
effectively raised.  Will the New World Order be truly "multi-cultural" with
the eventual amalgamation and obliteration of the races or are Whites, and
Colored too, being subtly encouraged to view remain separate through a
laughable false history which depicts Whites as the only real slavers and
Blacks and Native Americans as the only real slaves in the interests of
maintaining a "divide and conquer" system?  This falsehood obviously
intensifies Black rage against the entire White Race instead of the tiny
ruling class (including Jews) which benefitted from slavery and continues to
rule the world.  Whites, on the other hand, are encouraged to believe the
false notion that they are and always have been a specially privileged elite.
This leads them to unconsciously serve as the bodyguard of the conspiracy
against the assaults of enraged "minorities".  This system of manipulation may
continue to work even after Whites are no longer the majority in America!

Stolen Legacy:  The Greeks were not the authors of Greek Philosophy, but the
people of North Africa, commonly called the Egyptians by Professor George G.
M. James, 1954 In Print PB Reprint, 0190 pages, Order #00530 $13.95

Seminal work which laid the philosophical/historical basis for current upsurge 
in Black "latent-superiority" and conspiracy theories which claim that Blacks
in the Nile Valley were the true founders of all civilization.  Emphasizes
that the (Black) Egyptian contribution to Western Civilization was stolen from
the "Egyptian Mystery System" by then barbarian Greeks and fraudulently
transmitted to White Europe as "Greek Philosophy".

Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys by Jawanza Kunjufu, 1985 In 
Print Paperback, 0038 pages, Order #00483 $5.00

Radical African-American cites, a la Carroll Quigley, the Rhodes-Milner Round 
Table Conspiracy as his source for claiming the conspiracy is essentially a 
White racist conspiracy against people of color.  Claims the entire White race 
as well as many subjugated peoples are subtly drawn into the mechanics of 
oppression.  The author does not consider the possibility, taken on faith by 
most right-wing conspiracy researchers, that the conspiracy has moved beyond 
its original racist tactics as it moves toward a cosmopolitan Masonic world 
Empire.  This book is quite influential in the current movement for all male, 
Afro-centric schools in America's inner cities.

Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys (Vol II) by Jawanza Kunjufu, 
1986 In Print , 0047 pages, Order #00503

Author applies principles of Vol I in an attempt to achieve change.

The American Rich by Hoffaman Nickerson, 1939 Rare/Out-of-Print Hardcover,
0385 pages, Order #00517 $80.00

Dr. Emanuel M. Josephson, author of Rockefeller Internationalist, often touted 
this book as the key to understanding the ultimate strategy of the ruling
class/conspiracy for America:  Hereditary one-man rule or "Caesarism"
justified by intractable "multi-cultural" tribalism of America.

The Anvils of Destiny:  An Introduction to Cyberdynamics by Howard Robb, 1991 
In Print Hardcover, 0194 pages, Order #00679 $20.00

Important debunking of racial theories of the rise and fall of civilization.  
Postulates a very complex geopolitical-cultural heritage theory in the jargon 
of "cyberdynamics" or information theory.  My simplified application of some
of the principles presented:  Geography provides the isolation-insulation from
current military technology necessary for civilization to flourish.  Thus the
Egyptian fertile Nile Valley was sufficiently protected against invasion by
adjacent deserts for many Centuries until naval and military technology of
potential invaders (often taught by Egypt herself) reached a certain critical
level.  Later, insular peninsula's like Greece, Italy, Spain, and Europe
itself were necessary for sufficient insulation against higher levels of
military technology.  Later yet, insular islands, like Britain, and later
still insular continents like America proved necessary against escalating
air/naval technology and as a secure base to dominate the world.  Now, in the
age of ICBM's and Star Wars, the concept of insular nations begins to fade.
Now, only the ability to monopolize high technology and the "high frontier"
confers advantage.

The Isis (Yssis) Papers:  The Keys to the Colors by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing,
1991 In Print Paperback, 0301 pages, Order #00531 $14.95

Dr. Welsing, a Black California psychiatrist, has penned the most extreme 
anti-white ruling class/conspiracy theory imaginable and at the same time has 
presented a social organic-collective unconscious based, race-centered 
(racist) psychology that, if widely believed, would intensify race conflict to 
the point that genocidal race war would be inevitable.  In explaining how and 
why less than 10% of the world's population, the white race, holds the bulk of 
world power, Dr. Welsing rejects the "white racist" theory that severe 
northern climate selected for higher intelligence, courage, and/or 
determination enabling whites to dominate non-whites at every cultural 
contact, and the "conspiracy/philosophical" (Project?) theory that 
individualism and the scientific method was allowed by the Judeo-Masonic 
conspiracy to flourish openly, in preparation for world conquest, first in 
white societies which, in turn, lead to the industrial revolution occurring 
first in white societies enabling these whites (lead by their Judeo-Masonic 
elite) to dominate more primitive societies, white and non-white alike, with 
superior weapons and strategy.  Instead, Dr. Welsing claims that whites are 
genetically defective albinos who, after cruel rejection and expulsion from 
African societies, fled North where they compulsively compensated for their 
emotional-spiritual incapacities, skin color shame, and genital inadequacy by 
pursuing the evil technologies of exploitation and domination under a 
pretended ideology of white supremacy, all to perpetuate a defective gene-pool 
that would otherwise be destroyed through dominant "non-white" genes Dr. 
Welsing fails to consider that whites, under the discipline of "White Man's 
Burden" until recently, were simply the manipulated warrior class of the 
Supra-Imperialist, Egypt descending, Judeo-Masonic ruling class/conspiracy.  
Dr. Welsing's theories, by promoting "Black Rage" will, no doubt, help fashion 
the modified role as "Body Guard" of the elite planned for the white race and 
continuing inferior role for Blacks.


Social Organism Theory


The Evolution of Civilization by Carroll Quigley, 1961 In Print Paperback,
0441 pages, Order #00606 $15.00

Neo-Spenglerian theory of the rise and fall of civilization.  Claims 
civilization springs from a successful mechanism which allow an elite, ruling
class to extract a "surplus" from the people for further expansion.  Claims
"institutionalization" eventually makes the mechanism rather than the
extraction of surplus into an end in itself.  For instance Democracy itself
becomes a value in itself rather than a fraud perpetrated by the elite to gain
the consent of the ruled as originally intended!

Revolt of the Free by Robert C. Girard, 1988 In Print Paperback, 0072 pages,
Order #00429 $15.00

The head of a "Borderlands" research outfit, Arcturus Books, advocates forming 
a conspiracy of "the free" to save the earth from the popular bugaboos of 
overpopulation and environment ruin as well as an unpopular bugaboo--genetic
deterioration.  Oddly, Girard refuses to admit that a "ruling
class/conspiracy" already exists fully committed to his goals a la the "Global
2000" report!  Suggests all but a "core humanity", 1 in 10,000, be sterilized
so that the species can be regenerated on a "firmer footing"!  Spiritual,
"dream state" experiences of Girard indicate "Morphic resonance" with the
conspiracy or magic emanating therefrom?

Word Controlled Humans:  A Brief History by John Harland, In Print Paperback, 
0000 pages, Order #00607 $7.00

Radical advocate of individual sovereignty explores the human tendency to be 
subsumed by social organisms via self and reality-alienating tendencies of 
language.  Claims pre-Christian tribal life of Northern Europe most closely 
approximated a culture of true individual sovereignty.  Claims refusal to give 
up the right of individual combat in defense of self and honor is key to a
culture of true individual sovereignty.  Also author of Brave New World, A
Different Projection

defense.

The Presence of the Past:  Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature by 
Rupert Sheldrake, 1988 In Print Paperback, 0391 pages, Order #00140 $10.95

As the Project theory has evolved, the hypothesis of a ruling class conspiracy 
is often seen as a heurism for social power organism theory.  Without really
intending to, Sheldrake provides the philosophical, scientific, and biological
theory behind this relatively unknown concept.  Sheldrake also provides an
original framework for analyzing other controversial topics that have so far
eluded the standard materialist reductionism of establishment science
(scientism) such as evolution, consciousness, the occult, ESP, memory, organic
life, etc.

Origins of Western Social Organism


A Real Case Against the Jews:  One of Them Points Out the Full Depth of Their
Guilt by Marcus Eli Ravage, 1928 xerox reprint Xerox, 0012 pages, Order #00428
$7.00

Researchers intrigued by Reuchlin need to know the opposite, competing 
"conspiracy theory" of the "seeding" of the dominant Christian "social
organism."  Marcus Eli Ravage, a Jewish writer from the 1920's, who worshipped
at the feet of the Rothschilds as their approved biographer, wrote to prove
that Christianity was created by the Jews to destroy the Roman Empire and its
Pagan spirit that prevented Jewish control.  Only after Rome's transformation
by Jesus "meek and mild" could the Jews rise to covert imperium!  Jewish
satire or truth?

The True Authorship of the New Testament:  Arius Calpurnius Piso, A Roman by 
Abelard Reuchlin, 1979 In Print Paperback, 0040 pages, Order #00150 $6.00

Though providing scant evidence for his specific theory that Roman Oligarch
Piso wrote the New Testament to create a new religion for the Empire that
would at the same time defeat the growing power of the Jews, it provides
thought exercise for those willing to suspect Machiavellian origins of the
dominant Christian social organism.  Must reading!

The Golden Bough:  The Roots of Religion and Folklore by James G.  Frazer,

The Rise, Decline, & Fall of the Roman Religion by James Ballantyne Hannay, 
1925 In Print Paperback, 0257 pages, Order #00462 $12.00

Remarkable theory that both Judaism (including the Hebrew alphabet & language) 
and Christianity are synthetic creations of Roman scholars charged with the 
task of building a new State religion to unify the Empire and subjugate the 
masses.

Sex Symbolism in Religion:  Two (2) Volumes by John Ballantyne Hannay, 1922 In 
Print Paperback, 1184 pages, Order #00461 $38.95

Important information on the primacy of sex in the Roman, pre-Christian State
religion and its symbolic remnants in Christianity.  Frightening preview of
where the New Age movement may be retaking us? An ecologically sound
limitation on population growth:  Promote sexual license and experimentation
as a spiritual experience in the presence of deadly sexually transmitted
disease and advocate bogus preventative measures?

Pagan Christs by J. M. Robertson, 1903 Xerox reprint Spiral, 0171 pages, Order
#00438 $30.00

Robertson shows with a certain disturbing persuasiveness that Christianity 
merely borrowed and further "sanitized" the numerous and already mostly 
symbolic "human sacrifice" rituals of traditional pagan religions.  Should be 
read in conjunction with Reuchlin, Duran, and Ravage in evaluating the theory
that Christianity was consciously seeded to transform humanity for the Empire
in a new form.



Persistence of Royal Power

Theo Aronson, 1985 Rare/Out-of-Print Hardcover, 0300 pages, Order #00574
$32.00

Americans of all political persuasions are far too quick to dismiss the role 
of Royalty in modern world politics.  This new, well illustrated book provides 
a thorough review of the Kings of Europe before, during, and after the Great
War.  Though not the explicit theme of the book, the data provided supports
the Project theory of victory for the British Crown over the rival Royal
Houses of Europe as well or better than the "passing of the Royal age" theory.

Prussian dominated Germany that finally succeeded in German unification and 
one British allied, Hanseatic League descended Germany of cultured merchant 
Princes and City States that resisted unification to the bitter end.  
Fascinating information on the failed Coberg plan of Queen Victoria's 
husband's (Prince Albert) advisor, Baron Stockmar, to defeat Prussia and keep 
Germany British and the Northern anti-Vatican alliance intact!  Amazing 
introduction by Wolfgang, the current Prince of Hesse whose ancestors

Indispensable survey of European Royalty for those interested in the Project 
theory.  Clearly demonstrates Catholic-Vatican versus Judeo-Masonic-Protestant
orbits in modern Royalty and dispels the myth of "modern era" Royal impotence.
Modern Royalty sacrifices direct power to avoid direct responsibility.  Opts
for covert, long-term influence behind the veil of posing as a "figurehead".
Notes that only the Queen of England and the Pope are "Crowned".  The others

Caesarism


A Pillar of Iron:  The Life of Cicero by Taylor Caldwell, 195?
Rare/Out-of-Print Paperback, 0350 pages, Order #00480 $15.00

Novel detailing theory that Julius Caesar overthrew the Roman Republic as part

America.

The American Empire by Amaury De Riencourt, 1968 Rare/out-of-print Hardcover, 
0366 pages, Order #00431 $42.00

Refusal to consistently apply the term "Empire" leads many conspiriologists 
astray.  This follow-up to De Riencourt's The Coming Caesars is extremely 
useful for its thorough, illuminating survey of the roots of Anglo-American 
Imperialism and it progress during the Post WWII period:  Roots, Suicide of 
Europe, Pearl Harbor: Genesis of Empire, Cold War:  Establishment of Empire, 
Suez, Commonwealth, Pacific Frontier, Hawaianization of the Orient, 
Latins-Guerrillas-Anarchists, Race and Africa, Economic Hegemony, The Great 
Condominium.  De Riencourt is especially good for broaching the Anglo-American 
geopolitical strategy of covert alliance with the Soviets.

The Coming Caesars by Amaury De Riencourt, 1957 Rare/Out-of-Print Hardcover, 
0384 pages, Order #00432 $37.50

This book created a sensation when it was first released.  Few then or now 
want to apply the word "Empire" or "Imperial" to the nature of America's world
role, a role recently re-demonstrated in Iraq.  Under the barrage of daily
news, America's failures and short-comings take precedence in the minds of
most thinking Americans, creating an "underdog", "persecution complex" mind
set which, conveniently for the "Imperial Conspirators", blinds those without
a firm historical overview to Imperial reality.  Communist overuse of the term
Imperialism in their tired propaganda has also blinded otherwise intelligent
Americans to reality.  It is refreshing to see the term used properly by a
non-communist.  De Riencourt's prejudices, if any, appear to lie in the
direction of "European Culture" or perhaps, covertly, the French,
anti-Anglophile nationalism of Charles DeGaul.  Note:  De Riencourt is
especially good in illuminating the similarities of the Imperial roles of
Greece/Rome and Britain/America.

The Twelve Caesars by Gaius Tranquillus Suetonius, 120? In Print Paperback,
0362 pages, Order #00200 $7.00

Provides a raw view of Roman paganism from a contemporary of the Caesars.  
Conscious copying of Roman governmental, legal, and architectural forms by 
America's founding fathers is disturbing in the light of Roman "satanic"
practices of animal sacrifice, orture, blood sports, imperialism, etc.  Is
this book "good history" or simply "National Inquirer" style literature from
another era?  Or, Christian, anti-Pagan propaganda passed off as an original
historical document?

underlined the importance of Harvey's book for the Project theory, however: 
"The climactic passage...occurs in "Coin's" sixth and last lecture in which he 
spells out defiance of English power.  Here he urges that the experiment of 
monetary independence (silver standard) be tried, and that if the argument of 
the internationalists should prove correct, one should not capitulate to gold 
but wage war: 'If it is true, let us attach England to the United States and 
blot out her name from among the nations of the earth...a war with England 
would be the most popular ever waged on the face of the Earth and also the 
most just since it would be waged against a power that can dictate the money 
of the world, and thereby create world misery.'"

Alleged Secret Documents and Conspiracy Romance

The Lure (and Hook?) of Secret Documents:  For too many of its advocates and 
detractors, the truth or falsity of ruling class/conspiracy theories rests on 
the literal truth or falsity of a number of secret documents that have been
reprinted and distributed by various interested parties.  Partisans claim to
see spreading such documents as a benevolent service to humanity (or their
anointed collective) that will finally overthrow the evil power of the
"conspiracy" as they conceive it.  Detractors see such projects as thinly
veiled revolutionary propaganda designed by a would be elite to undermine
faith in existing institutions and/or pave the way to totalitarian seizure of
power.  Objectively speaking, however, it is impossible to over-estimate the
power of the genr
 by "exposing" the purported motives of the enemy to
intensify cohesion of the social organism whether for good or evil. Order

The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion by ? or The Learned Elders of 
Zion, ? In Print Paperback, 0000 pages, Order #00563 $6.00

The "Protocols" are, of course, classic in their field.  Originally,
distributed by the Czar's secret police and used to stir the populace into
frenzied anti-Semitic pogroms, it was later picked-up by Hitler and used to 
buttress the anti-Semitic passions that brought him to power.  Though it 
contains profound pieces of Machiavellian insight that are well worth reading 
and considering, it contains rather obvious pieces of propaganda for "Throne 
and Altar" style statism of the "Ancient Regime" that betray its fraudulent 
origins.

"Colonel" Edward Mandell House was eventually revealed as the author of this 
novel by Yale Professor Seymour's Intimate Papers of Colonel House.  Seymour 
revealed that House would hand the book to influential people with the words,
"This might interest you."  House (Woodrow Wilson's "Kissinger", founder of
the CFR, Federal Reserve System advocate, Income Tax advocate, WWI enthusiast,
and Kuhn-Loeb associate) presented in the form of a novel, the actual
rationale and program by which the welfare-warfare statism (veiled as
socialism as dreamed by Karl Marx) required by the "Imperial Crisis" presented
Britain by Germany was to be substituted for traditional American individual
liberties and isolationism.  We are still living in this novel.

Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars:  An Introductory Programming Manual by
Anonymous, 1979 In Print Paperback, 0056 pages, Order #00567 $12.00

This document attempts to masquerade as several chapters out of a top secret 
National Security Council Operations Research Technical Manual.  However, its 
style and emphasis quickly gives it away as a political-economic
romance-satire in the tradition of Joly, the Transcriber, and Colonel House.
However, its warning regarding the subtle totalitarian potential of
"operations research" (social-economic mathematical modeling and manipulation)
for benefitting a covert elite at the expense of liberty, justice, and
prosperity is well taken.  Must reading!

The Marvelous Career of L
o Taxil by Robert F. Byrnes, Reprint Pamphlet, 0010
pages, Order #00570 $3.00

This chapter excerpt explains the truly marvelous career circa 1885 in France 
of a crafter of phoney "secret documents" who took a generation of credulous 
and gullible Catholics, both clerics and laymen, into invented swamps of 
Satan-inspired conspiracies against the faith.  Translations of some of 
Taxil's imaginative works are still floating around though very hard to find 
now.  They still have their true believers in spite of Taxil's public 
confessions.  You see he was "forced" to confess to cover-up the conspiracy.  
There are many parallels in his work to the current spate of Satanic and 
Witchcraft conspiracies circulating in Fundamentalist layers.

France and a great portion of Germany, to say nothing of other countries--is
covered with a network of these secret societies, just as the superficies of
the Earth is now being covered with railroads.  And what are their objects?
They do not attempt to conceal them.  They do not want constitutional 
government;  they do not want ameliorated institutions..they want to change 
the tenure of the land, to drive out the present owners of the soil and to put 
and end to ecclesiastical establishments.  Some of them may go

Dialogues in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu:  Or the Policies of
Machiavelli in the Nineteenth Century--"Soon will be seen a frightful calm,
during which all will reunite against the infringing power of the laws.  When
Sulla desired to restore liberty to Rome, she was no longer able to harbor
it." (Montesquieu, Espirit des Louis) by Maurice Joly, 1864 Xerographic
Reprint of Spring-Summer 1978 Conspiracy Digest Pamphlet, 0024 pages, Order
#00564 $6.00

The "Dialogues" are, of course, the actual source from which Czarist fanatics 
plagiarized the brilliant parts of the "Protocols."  the anti-Semitic parts 
were all added by the Czarist agents--Joly in no way saw the Machiavellian 
techniques which were the subject of his covert expos
 as tools of "Jewish" 
power over gentiles.  Last gasp defenders of the Protocols such as Nesta 
Webster have asked where Joly obtained his information, as if the 
Machiavellian ideas he expressed in such a romantic original fashion were in 
any way new or unknown.  Of course, the elitist philosophy and techniques of 
exploiting the masses behind a mask of humanitarianism, justice, liberty, and 
democracy are as old as history albeit the naive of each generation are always 
shocked when first exposed to them.  Joly explains himself well enough in his 
preface:  "This book has characteristics that can be applied to all 
governments, but its goal is more exact; it personifies on particular 
political system (obviously Napoleon III's regime--Editor) which has not 
varied once in its methods since the fatal and alas! already too distant date 
of its enthronement...opinion in modern nations is too regimented to accept 
violent truths about contemporary affairs.  The supernatural duration of 
certain successes is, moreover, making for the corruption of honesty itself; 
but the public conscience is still alive and providence will one fine day 
interfere in the game being played against it.  One judges better certain 
facts and certain principles when one sees them outside of the framework in 
which they usually exist in our sight; the change in point-of-view sometimes 
terrifies the eyes!"

Triage by Leonard Lewin, 1972 Rare/Out-of-Print Hardcover, 0300 pages, Order
#00569 $40.00

This book continues "Iron Mountain's" line of thought from the perverted use 
of cold "operations research" modeling of society to the death-dealing covert 
operations of the action arm of the "Special Commission on National
Priorities".  One cannot help but suspect that Lyndon LaRouche received his
original inspiration circa 1972 from Lewin's books...the parallels in paranoia
are obvious!  We cannot help but suspect that much of the left-liberal
spectrum harbors a secret Lewin-style paranoia!  Not being able to accept that
80 years of "creeping socialism" has created far more government dependency
than a dwindling American prosperity can afford, liberal idealists see efforts
to foster independence as covert "fascist" projects to "destroy the poor" and
other "useless eaters."

The Report from Iron Mountain:  On the Possibility and Desirability of Peace 
by Leonard Lewin--Originally Anonymous, 1968 Reprint Paperback, 0109 pages,
Order #00568 $5.00

This book was written with such skill, sophistication, and political savvy 
that many on both the Left and Right, in spite of tell-tale slips and 
omissions, were unable to identify it as a masterful political-economic
romance-satire until Leonard Lewin, a political humorist, admitted authorship
in his subsequent book, Triage.  Of course, a la Nesta Webster's last gasp
defense of the "Protocols", "Iron Mountain" enthusiasts ask, "Where did Lewin
get his information?  He must have high level connections!  He must have seen
a similar report!"  Never does it cross the mind of the credulous that others
may be far more intelligent and well-read than they are and thereby capable of
such a creative writing project!

"Iron Mountain", named for the notorious, real life fall-out shelter for the 
Corporate-Government elite in which the "Special Study Group" allegedly met, 
in the books fanciful format, assumes throughout that social "cohesion and 
stability" is traditionally dependent solely on perpetual war or threat of war 
and concomitant extravagant defense spending, massive waste, and the universal 
draft or national service.  Or, as the libertarians say, "War is the health of 
the State!"  The "document" dispassionately considers such "alternatives" to 
war (remember Jimmy Carter's "Moral Equivalent of War" MEOW?) as intensifying 
oppression of minorities, elimination of natural births in favor of universal 
test-tube baby production, creating artificial protest and terrorist groups, 
destroying and poisoning the environment, euthanasia for useless eaters, 
promoting drug addiction, increasing poverty and squalor, ruinous space 
exploration expenditures, population reduction through dangerous food and 
water additives and designer diseases (written before AIDS), faking an 
invasion from Space (real purpose of Star Wars technology), etc., etc.  Part 
of the satire, no doubt, and what really gives away Lewin's fascinating 
exercise is the lack of discussion in the "Special Study Group" as to why 
their societal assumptions are true!  The satirical thought that all policy 
makers above a certain level are chosen on the basis of seeing these truths as 
"obvious" won't quite wash...or will it?!  Only once in passing does "The 
Special Study Group" refer to preserving the "class structure" as a possible 
rationale for their malevolent outlook.  Perhaps Lewin is subtly promoting the 
ruling class/conspiracy theory of welfare warfare statism while mouthing the 
"cohesion-stability" theory with tongue firmly in cheek.

Perhaps the most "current" covert policy to replace the need for war broached 
by "Iron Mountain" and one that was just gaining public attention in 1968 
(many thought as a diversion from the Vietnam War) was an environmentalist war 
to save the "planet".  However, quite curiously and without foundation, Lewin 
does not suggest that a fake environmentalist movement be encouraged to 
exaggerate environmental concerns.  Instead, Lewin suggest that pollution be 
increased to create a real crisis!  This cannot be an error on Lewin's part, 
but can only indicate his desire for the option of an environmentalist
campaign to replace war.  The unfounded idea that the government secretly
promotes pollution, an idea which "Iron Mountain" has spread widely on the
Left, serves to intensify passions in the environmentalist movement.

In any case, the knowledgeable reader will come away from "Iron Mountain" more 
firmly convinced than ever that, if not from an official government advisory
committee, socially malevolent ideas are entering the policy arena from
somewhere--most likely from the inner circle of the ruling class/conspiracy
long committed to covert manipulation of government policy for its own ends at
the expense of the people.

The Purloined Letter by Edgar Allen Poe, In Print--Various Short Story 
Collections Paperback, 0020 pages, Order #00572 $8.00

This classic mystery story shows clearly a little known principle of 
deception:  A secret is best hidden by placing it in plain sight, but by 
adding calculated misdirection that prevents its proper appreciation by the 
onlooker!  This insight, which I owe to Lyndon LaRouche, explains the lack of 
awareness of the British Monarchy as the center of the ruling class/conspiracy 
even in conspiracy research circles!  While preoccupied by the search for and 
analysis of secret documents, always supplied abundantly by the conspiracy 
itself, the conspiracy researcher overlooks the obvious.  Remember that the 
Royal Family was the first English language publisher of the "Protocols"!

The Occult Technology of Power:  The Initiation of the Son of a Finance 
Capitalist Into the Arcane Secrets of Economic and Political Power--Rends the

terrifying evil which plunders and tortures the 20th Century by The 
Transcriber, 1974 In Print Hardcover, 0054 pages, Order #00565 $8.95

This is another masterful work in the tradition of Joly's "Dialogues" which 
although originally published honestly as a political satire or romance, is
already moving toward legendary status as a "real" secret document.  The
Spotlight, in one of its very early issues, published it with permission but
without comment as if it were a secret document stolen from the inner circle
of a Rockefeller or Rothschild.  See the Summer 1987 Project for a more
complete review.

The British Intelligence Report by Sir William Wiseman, 1919 Xerox reprint
Pamphlet, 0012 pages, Order #00571 $5.00

This document purports to be a long letter dated 1919 from the British 
Intelligence Chief in America, Sir William Wiseman, to Lloyd George, Prime
Minister of England, describing the panoply of British front groups and
propaganda outlets successfully molding the trusting American "peasant" toward
continued support of the British Empire, His Majesty the King, and the
up-coming membership of America in the British sponsored League of Nations.
Though obvious satires and exaggerations give away the real author's game at
the outset, most of the document's revelations are true and in-line with the
Project theory!  Of course, the document found such gullible ears that it was
banned from the mails and Federal Agents threatened the Irish Catholic,
anti-British Dr. Maloney with "20 years"!  The document was still being
circulated as the "real thing" in 1929 when it was felt necessary to haul Dr.
Maloney before a Congressional Committee where he was forced to confess
authorship and the partisan, Irish Catholic, anti-League, anti-British motives
behind his venture in creative writing.  We cannot help but think that Dr.
Maloney may have been instrumental in blocking America's membership in the
League of Nations!

Tragedy and Hope:  A History of the World in Our Time by Carroll Quigley, 1960
In Print Hardcover, 1100 pages, Order #00637 $25.00

This book hit the American Right like a bombshell at the end of the 1960's
when Birchers such as Gary Allen, Cleon Skousen, and G. Edward Griffin began
to tout it and its ideas of a "Capitalist Conspiracy" above the "Communist
Conspiracy".  Oddly, the Birchers down played the Anglophile, British Empire,
British Royal Family pro-Vatican implications of Quigley and concentrated on
his mention of the International Bankers and their manipulation of Communism.
Quigley claimed to have had access to CFR papers during part of his career
and, thus, he was touted as an "Insider" who defected.  A more careful study
of his work and his career revealed that he was an Irish Catholic and an
insider at the Pope's Georgetown Jesuit University where his book had been
required reading for many years!  Far from breaking new ground, much of his
work is simply and up-dating and scholarization of the traditionalist Catholic
conspiracy theories of Fathers Fahey and Couglin.

Hitler's Secret Backers by Sidney Warburg, 1933 In Print Paperback, 0082 
pages, Order #00190 $10.00

Strange document claiming Rockefeller and Morgan were responsible for putting 
Hitler in power, allegedly written by a scion of an International Banking

age to be a "messenger boy" at the time.  Further, he did not come from a
wealthy family, but rose to the top from the mail room!

Puzzling Neighbors:  An Historical Guide to Understanding Modern M
xico by
Salvador Borrego E., 1987 In Print Paperback, 0119 pages, Order #00668 $12.00

Though written from a partisan Catholic viewpoint, this book contains the most 
brilliant, concise explanation of the founding of the Judeo-Masonic-Protestant
conspiracy to rule the world imaginable.  For this alone, the book is must
reading.  Though strongly anti-communist, do not expect Borrego's book to be a
"South of the Border" version of "None Dare Call It Conspiracy".  America is
clearly identified as a Masonic nation, covertly committed from its founding
to a "New World Order" and the destruction of everything Catholic.  Numerous
Presidents are pictured in their Masonic regalia.  The devastating civil wars
that have plagued Mexico since it gained independence from Spain, and have
left it in its current shambles, are shown for what they were, cold-blooded,
successful, Anglo-Masonic plots for the economic exploitation and destruction
of a Catholic country.

The Undermining of the Catholic Church by Mary Ball Mart
nez, 1991 In Print
Paperback, 0200 pages, Order #00561 $15.00

Author presents Vatican II as the effect, not the cause of a Church subverting 
process consciously put into motion at the turn of the Century with the

years earlier as "confusing, ambiguous, vague, and inappropriately

the primary advocate or even "conscious conspirator" behind this project that
eventually transformed the Church through Vatican II.  Must reading for

Chronicles the rise of the Jews who arrived after the German Jewish "Our 
Crowd" bankers had already established themselves on Wall Street.  Includes 
biographical sketches of Helena Rubenstein, Sarnoff, Meyer Lansky, and Sam 
Bronfman.  Bronfman, who founded Seagrams during prohibition, has often been 
cited for his connections to the British Oligarchy which is rumored to have 
sponsored his liquor business as part of their "prohibition" scam against 
America.  Revealingly, Birmingham characterized Bronfman as follows:  "Adding 
the work 'Crown' to Seagram's Seven was characteristic of Sam.  He was awed by 
royalty and still harbored a fierce hope that the British Crown might one day 
make him a knight..in the process doffing his corporate hat to the Royal 
Family..one of many such gestures."  Birmingham also suggests that Jack Ruby 
was one of the many "Jewish Barkeeps" under Lansky control!

How dead is anti-democratic nationalism in Germany?  This question was 
interesting in 1967 when this incredibly detailed study of the roots and
current state of German nationalism was undertaken, but crucial today as
Germany lines up with the Vatican to fight the Anglo-American cabal!  The
first skirmish since the downfall of the Soviet Union was Croatia, where the
Anglo-Americans predictably supported the oppressors of a Catholic nationalism
that had won the support of Germany.

Establishment foundations in seeding and nurturing the revolution for subtle
reasons of consolidating concentrated economic power and/or for a strategy of
destruction: clearing the ground in the service of the "New World Order"!

fabled "City" is controlled by Vatican orbit "deposits".

this dynamic duo that Quigley called "the greatest wire-pullers of the period
(WWI)".  Though a difficult area, one that we have pursued without much
success since 1987,  we continue to gather data.

~MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
YES!!I want to receive the Project, the executive summary of the on-going
research of a private network dedicated to applying the scientific method to
conspiracy theories of history.  Current issues of the Project revolve around
clarifying, elaborating, and testing the hypothesis that a traditionally
London-centered world money cartel, under the patronage of the British Crown,
vies for dominion of world affairs on multiple levels with the Vatican, the
Empire of the City(of London)'s ancient enemy and competing social organic
heir to the mantle of Rome.  The Project appears quarterly for social-
political-religious activists, investors, futurologists, students of
geopolitics, students of secret societies and subversion, observers of super-
rich dynasties, students of social organic collective consciousness, and
others who, though not necessarily non-partisan themselves, can benefit from
objective, non-partisan ruling class/conspiracy scholarship.

                                 A Note On Recommended Reading

The books, reports, and articles recommended are not without serious faults
from the point-of-view of the Project.  Most are guilty of blatant partisan
bias, too often on the basis of ideology, religion, race, class, interest
group, etc.  Unfortunately, by its nature, ruling class research is not and
probably never will be solely the province of disinterested scholars. 
However, keep in mind that the bootlicking, lying court historians
cultivate only the appearance of objectivity and, therefore, deserve even
less credit than some of the partisan authors we have recommended.

The Project hypothesis is unique in ruling class-conspiracy literature. 
None of the authors recommended present the Project theory.  The
recommended reading simply contributes facts, research leads, evidence,
testimony, insights, theorizing, and speculation relevant to the Project's
progress toward uncovering the objective nature of the ruling class-
conspiracy or power organism(s).  Do not judge the Project theory by the
readings recommended. We recommend many authors not for objective
information, but for insight into the propaganda of the social power
organism which holds them in thrall. For the evolving Project theory
consult only the Project back issues, especially the August 1985 Issue
($9.00) for the original theory nd the Winter-Spring 1989-90 Issue ($9.00)
for a major revision of working hypothesis.
