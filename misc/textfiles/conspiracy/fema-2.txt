       Even those Executive Orders which have been made public tend to
    raise as many questions as they answer about what actions were
    considered and actually implemented.  On January 8, 1991, Bush signed
    Executive Order 12742, National Security Industrial Responsiveness,
    which ordered the rapid mobilization of resources such as food,
    energy, construction materials and civil transportation to meet
    national security requirements.  There was, however, no mention in
    this or any other EO of the National Defense Executive Reserve (NDER)
    plan administered under FEMA.  This plan, which had been activated
    during World War II and the Korean War, permits the federal government
    during a state of emergency to bring into government certain
    unidentified individuals.  On January 7, 1991 the "Wall Street Journal
    Europe" reported that industry and government officials were studying
    a plan which would permit the federal government to "borrow" as many
    as 50 oil company executives and put them to work streamlining the
    flow of energy in case of a prolonged engagement or disruption of
    supply.  Antitrust waivers were also being pursued and oil companies
    were engaged in emergency preparedness exercises with the Department
    of Energy.[5]

    Wasting the Environment
       In one case the use of secret powers was discovered by a watchdog
    group and revealed in the press.  In August 1990, correspondence
    passed between Colin McMillan, Assistant Secretary of Defense for
    Production and Logistics and Michael Deland, Chair of the White House
    Council on Environmental Quality.  The letters responded to
    presidential and National Security Council directives to deal with
    increased industrial production and logistics arising from the
    situation in the Middle East.  The communications revealed that the
    Pentagon had found it necessary to request emergency waivers to U.S.
    environmental restrictions.[6]
       The agreement to waive the National Environmental Policy Act (1970)
    came in August.  Because of it, the Pentagon was allowed to test new
    weapons in the western U.S., increase production of materiel and
    launch new activities at military bases without the complex public
    review normally required.  The information on the waiver was
    eventually released by the Boston-based National Toxic Campaign Fund
    (NTCF), an environmental group which investigates pollution on the
    nation's military bases.  It was not until January 30, 1991, five
    months after it went into effect, that the "New York Times," acting
    on the NTCF information, reported that the White House had bypassed
    the usual legal requirement for environmental impact statements on
    Pentagon projects.[7]  So far, no specific executive order or
    presidential finding authorizing this waiver has been discovered.
       Other environmental waivers could also have been enacted without
    the public being informed.  Under a state of national emergency, U.S.
    warships can be exempted from international conventions on
    pollution[8] and public vessels can be allowed to dispose of
    potentially infectious medical wastes into the oceans.[9]  The
    President can also suspend any of the statutory provisions regarding
    the production, testing, transportation, deployment, and disposal of
    chemical and biological warfare agents (50 USC sec. 1515).  He could
    also defer destruction of up to 10 percent of lethal chemical agents
    and munitions that existed on November 8, 1985.[10]
       One Executive Order which was made public dealt with "Chemical and
    Biological Weapons Proliferation."  Signed by Bush on November 16,
    1990, EO 12735 leaves the impression that Bush is ordering an
    increased effort to end the proliferation of chemical and biological
    weapons.  The order states that these weapons "constitute a threat to
    national security and foreign policy" and declares a national
    emergency to deal with the threat.  To confront this threat, Bush
    ordered international negotiations, the imposition of controls,
    licenses, and sanctions against foreign persons and countries for
    proliferation.  Conveniently, the order grants the Secretaries of
    State and the Treasury the power to exempt the U.S. military.
       In February of 1991, the Omnibus Export Amendments Act was passed
    by Congress compatible with EO 12735.  It imposed sanctions on
    countries and companies developing or using chemical or biological
    weapons.  Bush signed the law, although he had rejected the identical
    measure the year before because it did not give him the executive
    power to waive all sanctions if he thought the national interest
    required it.[11]  The new bill, however, met Bush's requirements.

    Going Off Budget
       Although some of the powers which Bush assumed in order to conduct
    the Gulf War were taken openly, they received little public discussion
    or reporting by the media.
       In October, when the winds of the Gulf War were merely a breeze,
    Bush used his executive emergency powers to extend his budget
    authority.  This action made the 1991 fiscal budget agreement between
    Congress and the President one of the first U.S. casualties of the
    war.  While on one hand the deal froze arms spending through 1996, it
    also allowed Bush to put the cost of the Gulf War "off budget."  Thus,
    using its emergency powers, the Bush administration could:

       * incur a deficit which exceeds congressional budget authority;

       * prevent Congress from raising a point of order over the
         excessive spending;[12]

       * waive the requirement that the Secretary of Defense submit
         estimates to Congress prior to deployment of a major defense
         acquisition system;

       * and exempt the Pentagon from congressional restrictions on
         hiring private contractors.[13]

       While there is no published evidence on which powers Bush actually
    invoked, the administration was able to push through the 1990 Omnibus
    Reconciliation Act.  This legislation put a cap on domestic spending,
    created a record $300 billion deficit, and undermined the Gramm-
    Rudman-Hollings Act intended to reduce the federal deficit.  Although
    Congress agreed to pay for the war through supplemental appropriations
    and approved a $42.2 billion supplemental bill and a $4.8 billion
    companion "dire emergency supplemental appropriation,"[14] it
    specified that the supplemental budget should not be used to finance
    costs the Pentagon would normally experience.[15]
       Lawrence Korb, a Pentagon official in the Reagan administration,
    believes that the Pentagon has already violated the spirit of the 1990
    Omnibus Reconciliation Act.  It switched funding for the Patriot,
    Tomahawk, Hellfire and HARM missiles from its regular budget to the
    supplemental budget;  added normal wear and tear of equipment to
    supplemental appropriations;  and made supplemental requests which
    ignore a planned 25% reduction in the armed forces by 1995.[16]

    The Cost In Liberty Lost
       Under emergency circumstances, using 50 USC sec. 1811, the
    President could direct the Attorney General to authorize electronic
    surveillance of aliens and American citizens in order to obtain
    foreign intelligence information without a court order.[17]  No
    Executive Order has been published which activates emergency powers to
    wiretap or to engage in counter-terrorist activity.  Nonetheless,
    there is substantial evidence that such activities have taken place.
    According to the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, the
    FBI launched an anti-terrorist campaign which included a broad sweep
    of Arab-Americans.  Starting in August, the FBI questioned, detained,
    and harassed Arab-Americans in California, New York, Ohio,
    Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Colorado.[18]
       A CIA agent asked the University of Connecticut for a list of all
    foreign students at the institution, along with their country of
    origin, major field of study, and the names of their academic
    advisers.  He was particularly interested in students from the Middle
    East and explained that the Agency intended to open a file on each of
    the students.  Anti-war groups have also reported several break-ins of
    their offices and many suspected electronic surveillance of their
    telephones.[19]

    Pool of Disinformation
       Emergency powers to control the means of communications in the U.S.
    in the name of national security were never formally declared.  There
    was no need for Bush to do so since most of the media voluntarily and
    even eagerly cooperated in their own censorship.  Reporters covering
    the Coalition forces in the Gulf region operated under restrictions
    imposed by the U.S. military.  They were, among other things, barred
    from traveling without a military escort, limited in their forays into
    the field to small escorted groups called "pools," and required to
    submit all reports and film to military censors for clearance.  Some
    reporters complained that the rules limited their ability to gather
    information independently, thereby obstructing informed and objective
    reporting.[20]
       Three Pentagon press officials in the Gulf region admitted to James
    LeMoyne of the "New York Times" that they spent significant time
    analyzing reporters' stories in order to shape the coverage in the
    Pentagon's favor.  In the early days of the deployment, Pentagon press
    officers warned reporters who asked hard questions that they were seen
    as "anti-military" and that their requests for interviews with senior
    commanders and visits to the field were in jeopardy.  The military
    often staged events solely for the cameras and would stop televised
    interviews in progress when it did not like what was being portrayed.
       Although filed soon after the beginning of the war, a lawsuit
    challenging the constitutionality of press restrictions was not heard
    until after the war ended.  It was then dismissed when the judge ruled
    that since the war had ended, the issues raised had become moot.  The
    legal status of the restrictions--initially tested during the U.S.
    invasions of Grenada and Panama--remains unsettled.

    A National Misfortune
       It will be years before researchers and journalists are able to
    ferret through the maze of government documents and give a full
    appraisal of the impact of the President's emergency powers on
    domestic affairs.  It is likely, however, that with a post-war
    presidential approval rating exceeding 75 percent, the domestic
    casualties will continue to mount with few objections.  Paradoxically,
    even though the U.S. public put pressure on Bush to send relief for
    the 500,000 Iraqi Kurdish refugees, it is unlikely the same outcry
    will be heard for the 37 million Americans without health insurance,
    the 32 million living in poverty, or the country's five million hungry
    children.  The U.S. may even help rebuild Kuwaiti and Iraqi civilian
    infrastructures it destroyed during the war while leaving its own
    education system in decay, domestic transportation infrastructures
    crumbling, and inner city war zones uninhabitable.  And, while the
    U.S. assists Kuwait in cleaning up its environmental disaster, it will
    increase pollution at home.  Indeed, as the long-dead Prussian field
    marshal prophesied, "a war, even the most victorious, is a national
    misfortune."

     redeploying the forces and waging war at about $70 billion.  The
     administration sought and received $56 billion in pledges from allies
     such as Germany, Japan and Saudi Arabia.  Although the military's
     estimates of casualties and the war's duration were highly inflated,
     today their budget estimates remain at around $70 billion even though
     the Congressional Budget office estimates that cost at only $40
     billion, $16 billion less than allied pledges.
