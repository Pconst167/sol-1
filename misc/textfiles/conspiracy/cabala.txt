              The Ancient Secret Meaning of some of the extended
                        ASCII characters, and beyond.

                     Researched by Henry J. Franzoni III

              You must be able to display all 256 characters in the
              IBM PC extended ASCII symbol set to read this text.
              (Ctrl-QG in Sidekick, Graphics mode in MS Word, the
              TYPE command, etc.)

         Below is a brief attempt to demonstrate a strange connection
    between the IBM PC symbol system and the hidden metaphorical secrets
    of the early Greek Cabalists and Christian Gnostics. Perhaps Hebrew
    Cabalists, Masons and other groups used similar methods.  If this
    subject matter offends you please stop reading this file
    and erase it.  If this sort of subject matter strikes you as
    far-fetched, hey, give it a chance, read a little further
    before you dismiss it completely.   I have tried to present
    this information with a minimum of personal interpretation.
    The interesting examples below speak for themselves, I think.

         I do have a viewpoint that colors my perceptions though.
    I tend to look at computers as tools to manipulate symbol
    systems.  Words, numbers, pictures,... a computer looks
    at these things as one and the same thing, symbols.  Different
    languages are different symbol systems for the computer to
    manipulate and display.  Humans can manipulate
    all kinds of symbols easily with a computer and display them
    on the screen or print them on paper.  I've always been
    interested in the story behind the symbol systems we use,
    and what hidden meaning, if any, existed for the creators
    of the symbol systems we use.  You might enjoy this.  Please
    do not abuse this information.  I am interested in sharing
    this information with reasonable, responsible people, not fanatics.
    If any of this disturbs your personal system of beliefs, why
    then, just throw it away and ignore it, this IS America.
    I claim no responsiblity for any damages arising from the use
    of this knowledge.  I trust you use it wisely.

         Immediately below is a mapping between the Greek alphabet
    and a number cipher rumoured to be a Cabalist number code.
    When there are two or more entries in the Greek Alphabet
    Symbol column, the first is the upper case form and the second is
    the lower case form. In the case of sigma, the extra form
    is for when sigma is the last letter in a word.  In the word/number
    examples below the list, the upper case is used in a few places
    it shouldn't be because the PC symbol set only had the uppercase
    version of the Greek letter.  The code/cipher number which
    corresponds to each Greek letter is in the fifth column from the left.
    There is no symbol for the sixth Greek letter, which had the sound
    of "st". This symbol was discontinued in ancient times.  I do not
    know why there is no symbol for 90, it might be the same reason
    as for 6.  Maybe you know?

         What good is it?  Well below are some examples of the
    early usage of this code.  The Greek word is first followed by
    the English translation.  Each letter in each word is converted
    into its numerical equivalent, and then the word is summed, for
    your personal edification and pleasure.  Certain words and
    phrases are then summed and compared with each other.  The
    Greek quotations are from the original Greek New Testament.

                                        TOTAL FOR ALL NUMBERS = 666

         And we might remember from Revelation 13:

           'Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count
            the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man;
            and his number is Six hundred threescore and six'

    Let's add the 666 and 1080 together.

    1080
  +  666
  ------
    1746

   Metaphorically speaking, it seems we've added Teitan and the Sun to
   the spirit of the earth, the Holy Spirit, (the sum of Jesus and
   Mary), the fountain of wisdom, and the abyss.

  2576 = (23 x 7 x 4˝) = (23 x 112)  {Remember that (24 x 111) = 2664}

  2664 - 2576 = 88

       Now another interesting sum is 831.

         Hermes was identified with the Roman God Mercury. Both were
    the messengers for the other Gods, and were themselves the Gods
    of commerce, travel, and thievery.  The magic square of Mercury
    is traditional.  By the way, 352 x 9 = 3168.

         The internal consistancy of the relationships between
    the examples, both metaphorically and numerically, makes me
    personally lean towards the thought that someone purposefully
    designed this alternate numerical interpretation, and named these
    things accordingly.  If you come to think this also, you may
    wonder who did it? Well, maybe nobody at all, one interpretation
    is that the letters also served as numbers in the old languages,
    (Hebrew, Greek, Arabic), and this may have been common everyday
    knowledge. Everyone may have looked at each word as a
    "number and/or a word", to use the modern definitions of these
    things.  However, somebody may have named these things in this
    way, and here are some educated guesses as to who.

         Perhaps it was the unknown founders of Christianity
    who preceeded the Founding Fathers of the Christian Church.
    St. Irenaeus of the second century A.D. was one of the early
    Founding Fathers of the Christian Church who was a bitter
    opponent of the Gnostic sect.  He calls this practice
    inherited from pagan philosophers "arithmomancy", The
    interpretation of divine names and principles in
    numeric terms.  He was said to have been instructed by
    Gnostics before becoming the Bishop of Lyons, and
    quoted and parodied Gnostic doctrines, discrediting them.
    It is said early Gnostics valued inquiry into spiritual truth
    above faith, thought salvation attainable only by those few whose
    faith enabled them to transcend matter, and viewed Christ as
    non-corporeal.

         Some early Masons, Sumarians, and Muslims may have encoded
    information in their texts, I'm not sure.  I think the evidence
    does support the notion that early Hebrews did encode, and
    earlier than their Greek counterparts.  Hippolytus in the
    second century A.D., said that the "Celts honour them (The Greeks)
    as prophets and seers because they foretell matters by the
    ciphers and numbers according to the Pythagorian skill...
    The Druids also practice the magic arts."  Egyptians, Persians,
    Indian Brahmins, and the Chaldeans of Assyria may have also
    practiced these arts.  Clement of Alexandria wrote that the
    Pythagorians took there philosophy from "the Gauls and other
    barbarians."  "Gauls" was Julius Caesars' name for the Celts.

         The Phoenicians may have been in on the beginning as well,
    when around 1000 B.C. they started to use graphic signs that
    the Greeks later borrowed and modified, (around 900 B.C.)
    for their own alphabet.  I don't know if the Phoenicians used
    the same code, but here is an example of Hebrew Cabalist writing.

         In Hebrew, the Tetragrammaton, the ineffable, unpronouncable
    name of God is transliterated "YHWH" or "JHWH" and is pronounced
    "Yahweh" or "Jehovah".  The four Hebrew letters used as a symbol
    or substitute for the ineffable name of God, have names in English.
    Using these English nouns rather than the Hebrew symbols, which is the
    best we can do with the PC symbol set, the ineffable name of God
    looks like this:

                         hä waw hä yodh

         This is read from left to right, with yodh having a "Y" sound,
    hä having a "H" sound, and waw having a "W" sound.
    We will use the same Cabalist code as in the Greek alphabet,
    but we don't have to leave any letters out as we did with
    the Greek alphabet.
    Bear with me and look at the Hebrew alphabet mapping below:

    Okay, now back to the Tetragrammaton, ineffable name of God:

                     hä waw hä yodh

                     5 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 26

         It would seem that the characteristic sum is 26.
    But, rumour has it that the ineffable name of God should be
    arranged precisely like this, don't ask me why:

                          yodh          = 10             = 10
                        hä yodh         = 5 + 10         = 15
                      waw hä yodh       = 6 + 5 + 10     = 21
                    hä waw hä yodh      = 5 + 6 + 5 + 10 = 26  +
                                                          ------
                                                           72

    The characteristic sum of the Tetragrammaton is 72 this way.

        Another Hebrew tradition, is that the two letters:

                     heth yodh

                      8 + 10 = 18

    are the symbol for life.  Even today, I know Jewish people
    that wear these two letters, totaling eighteen, on
    necklaces, etc.  There's no telling how old this Hebrew ritual
    really is.

         I won't draw any conclusions here but it is interesting to note
    the following least common denominator and least common multiple
    relationships between most of the numbers mentioned above.

  18 = (3 x 6)   = (6 x 3)   = (9 x 2)   = (18 x 1)
  72 = (3 x 24)  = (6 x 12)  = (9 x 8)   = (18 x 4)               = (72 x 1)
 666 = (3 x 222) = (6 x 111) = (9 x 74)  = (18 x 37)  = (37 x 18)
 777 = (3 x 259)                                      = (37 x 21)
 888 = (3 x 296) = (6 x 148)                          = (37 x 24)
1080 = (3 x 360) = (6 x 180) = (9 x 120) = (18 x 60)              = (72 x 15)
1746 = (3 x 582) = (6 x 291) = (9 x 194) = (18 x 97)
2664 = (3 x 888) = (6 x 444) = (9 x 296) = (18 x 148) = (37 x 72) = (72 x 37)
3168 = (3 x 1056)= (6 x 528) = (9 x 352) = (18 x 176)             = (72 x 44)
5040 = (3 x 1680)= (6 x 840) = (9 x 560) = (18 x 280)             = (72 x 70)

        Every number can be divided by 3.  All but 777 can be
    divided by 6.  I don't think this particular direction
    of endeavor will lead to any powerful sense of meaning though.
    There does appear to be some pattern along the lines of
    the least common denominator though.

        The number 5040 is the number that Plato wrote in "Laws"
    as the number of citizens and land holdings in the city of
    Magnesia.  Plato observed that changes in government are
    brought about by changes in music.  In "Timaeus" he said that
    "the sight of night and day, of months and the revolving
    years, of equinox and sunset, have caused the invention
    of number...whence we have derived all philosophy".
    Dr. Ernest McClain, the Pythagorean musicologist, believes
    that 5040 is the top note of the musical scale that Plato
    conceals in the structure of "Laws".  I don't know about that.

         Particular numbers of interest for the unknown authors were
    18, 37, 72, 192, 352, 365, 666, 777, 888, 1080, 1746, 2080,
    2664 and 3168.  The numbers 580, 831, and 1500 don't seem to
    be as frequently used by the authors, although 1500 + 580 = 2080.

         666 seems to have a positive meaning in the scheme of things,
    the exclusive negative interpretation of this symbol does not
    take in to account its association with the Sun.  My opinion is
    that someone perverted its meaning along the way, and narrowed
    the focus of its meaning to "the beast". I don't know who.
    Perhaps the more superstitious of the early Christians.
    Besides, the quote from the Bible says its "the number of a man"
    as well, and that's what apparantly started the bruhaha.

         Fudging one above or one below the desired sum didn't seem
    to matter to the unknown writers (I.E. 1081 and 353 seem to
    be as good as 1080 and 352).

        Rumour has it that the 6 x 6 and 8 x 8 magic squares have a
    historical association with the Sun and Mercury, repectively.  Perhaps
    it is more than a coincidence that the sum of all the numbers in each
    are 666 and 2080, respectively.  Think about the metaphorical
    meaning of the phrases that add up to these two totals. Can anyone
    find more words or phrases that add up to 111, 260, 666 or 1080 ?

       Odd spurious numerical facts:  (Draw your own conclusions, if any.)

    72, 666, 1080, 1746, 2664, and 3168 are all multiples of 18.

    666, 888, and 2664 are all multiples of 37, 74, and 111.

    111, and 777 are multiples of 37 and 111.

    1080, 2664, and 3168 are all multiples of 36 and 72.

    192 = (64 x 3) = (48 x 2˝) = (32 x 6)

    666 = (1 + 2 + 3 +...+ 34 + 35 + 36)

    888 + 192 = 1080

    1080 + 666 = 1746

    1746 = (97 x 3˝ x 2) = (194 x 3˝) = (291 x 3 x 2) = (582 x 3) = (873 x 2)

    2080 = (1 + 2 +...+ 63 + 64) = (52 x 40) = (13 x 32 x 5) = (260 x 8)
         = (13 x 160)

    2664 = (666 x 2˝) = (888 x 3) = (72 x 37) = (74 x 36)
         = (37 x 2˝ x 2 x 3˝) = (18 x 148)

    3168 = (72 x 44) = (9 x 352)

    5040 = (1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7) = (7 x 8 x 9 x 10)

    Multiples of six seem to matter somehow: 36, 216, 864, 1296, etc.

    Multiples of twelve also: 144, 1728, 20736, 248832, etc.

         Ì or Ë represents the ratio of the "golden section"
    in mathmatics.  Its value is 1.61803399 and is obtained by
    the formula:

                   1 + ˚5
                   ------ = Ì
                     2

     Also, as a Fibonacci series progresses further and further,
     (1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 + 21 +...),
     the ratio between successive numbers approaches asymptotically
     to Ì.  This occurs in sunflowers and seashells, etc.

         Many of these numbers arise when attempting to represent the
    chromatic scale of music in terms of integers and whole numbers.

         I hope you didn't find this a waste of time.  I know it might seem
    like I am a mental case who sees a pattern out of randomly organized
    data, but really who's to say?  This IS America, after all.
    Maybe this even elucidates a previously obfuscated ritual or thought
    in your personal system of beliefs, you never know how this
    stuff gets around.  You never know what its going to be applied to next.
    Leave messages on The Machine (NY), The BOSS (NJ), Darwin (MD), or
    Cliffside Park (NJ) if you want to get in touch with me.  You could
    write to 822 S.E. 15th st. Portland OR, 97214, I pick up mail there.
    Don't write any fanatical tirades though, I don't need any.
    I am interested in finding Greek, Hebrew, Phoenician, etc.,
    words, phrases or anything else that may add up to the numbers 45,
    136, 325, 666, 1225, 2080, 3321, 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, 260, or 369
    in particular at the moment.  Any other relevant tidbits of
    knowledge will be welcome.

                             uh yes, I am nuts...
