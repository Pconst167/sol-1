Congratulations!  You're about to unlock the speed and power of your
modem by using the fastest file transfer protocol available:

                             HyperProtocol

This HyperProtocol module is distributed free, to show the speed and 
quality of Hilgraeve software.  Hilgraeve's HyperACCESS/5 is the 
fastest of all communications programs and has HyperProtocol, Zmodem, 
and many other protocols built right in.  PC Magazine, PC Week, 
Personal Computing, and Software Digest have all rated it the best 
communications software available.

You can easily integrate this external protocol module with PCBoard, 
RBBS, or other bulletin board software, to give your users extremely 
high speed data transfers.  Or you can use it with Telix, Qmodem, 
Procomm, or any comm program that supports external protocol modules or 
has a DOS shell feature.

As with other protocols, HyperProtocol must be in use at both ends of 
the connection.

HyperProtocol  In independent tests, HyperProtocol (or "HYPERP") was
is fastest!    found to be up to five times faster than Kermit, Xmodem
               and other popular file transfer protocols.  You'll save
               time (and long-distance charges) and see your transfer
               rate blast even higher than the baud rate of your modem.

Quick and      If you are already using a conventional modem and comm-
easy to use    unications program, your computer is probably ready to
               use HyperProtocol.

               If your system is like most, you can use HyperProtocol 
               right away.  If not, or if you want to increase your 
               control, HYPERP is versatile enough that you can set it 
               up to meet your precise needs.

Try it!        We have arranged for a quick demonstration using our
You'll see     Bulletin Board in Monroe, Michigan.

1. Copy        Copy the HYPERP.EXE into the same directory as your
               communications software.

2. Set up      Set up your system for 8N1 (8 data bits, no parity, 1
               stop bit).  1200 or 2400 baud.  This example assumes you
               are using COM1 for your modem.  If not, see HyperProtocol
               OPTIONS below.

3. Call        Call the Hilgraeve Bulletin Board at 313-243-5915. Log
               in with your name, then enter your own password.

4. Type        Select "Download HyperProtocol DOS Module or HCOPY," 
               and then download HCOPY, a free utility that guards
               against copying files that contain computer viruses.

5. Exit        Use your software's utilities to go to a DOS prompt while
               retaining your connection with Hilgraeve.

6. Type        Type HYPERP RECEIVE and press ENTER.

7. Watch       Watch the "Throughput" at the bottom right of your
               screen.  That's the baud rate of the data flowing into
               your computer.  You'll see your modem handling up to five
               times its normal rate.

               HyperProtocol also displays a bargraph showing how much
               of data has been transferred.

8. Return      Return to your communications program and disconnect from 
               the Hilgraeve BBS.  HyperProtocol is fast and simple to 
               operate from your current communications package.  (You'd 
               find it even faster and easier if you had HyperACCESS/5, 
               which has HyperProtocol built right in.)


HYPERPROTOCOL  You may have a special hardware configuration that 
OPTIONS        requires you to enter some special options.  If you want
               to accept the default, you don't have to make an entry at
               all.

               You can adjust the following parameters:

                         Port           Suspend
                         Baud rate      Logfile
                         Time stamp     Display
                         Check type     Overwrite
                         Compress 

How to use     To use an option, simply include it in your command 
options        string.

               In the test above, you typed HYPERP RECEIVE.  To tell
               HyperProtocol not to compress files, you would type

                  HYPERP COMPRESS:OFF RECEIVE

               Enter all the options between HYPERP and the SEND or
               RECEIVE command.

HyperProtocol  The following options are listed with 
Options Data   -  CHOICES you can make.
               -  the DEFAULT used if you omit the option.
               -  WRITTEN AS, which explains how you include the option
                  in your command.
               -  an explanation of the option.

Baud rate      CHOICES: 300-19200            DEFAULT:  set by modem
               WRITTEN AS:   Baud:1200
               The baud rate is the speed (in bits per second) your
               modem communicates.

Checktype      CHOICES:  CRC, Checksum       DEFAULT:  CRC
               WRITTEN AS:    Checktype:CRC
               Checktype defines the error checking method.  CHECKSUM is
               less rigorous but is slightly faster.  CRC (Cyclical
               Redundancy Checking) is more exacting.  Select CRC if you
               suspect noise on the phone line.

Compress       CHOICES:  On, Off             DEFAULT:  On
               WRITTEN AS:    Compress:ON
               HyperProtocol's high speed in part stems from its
               ability to compress files during the transfer.  When set
               to ON, HYPERP compresses files if it can.  It can sense
               files that are already compressed (like .ZIP or .ARC 
               files) and doesn't attempt to compress them further.

Display        CHOICES:  On, Off             DEFAULT:  On
               WRITTEN AS:    Display:OFF
This option    The HyperProtocol module normally displays a bargraph so
is for BBS     you can watch the progress of each transfer, and when the
operators!     transfer completes, you must press a key to continue.

               If you are a bulletin board operator and want unattended
               operation, you MUST set DISPLAY:OFF.  This eliminates the
               bargraphs and the need to press a key after each transfer.

Handshake      CHOICES: None, RTS/CTS, XOFF/XON    DEFAULT: XOFF/XON
               WRITTEN AS:    Handshake:RTS/CTS
               XOFF/XON is used with most conventional modems.  Select 
               RTS/CTS if you have a high-speed (9600 or 19,200 bps) or 
               MNP modem which is currently set up to use RTS/CTS.

Logfile        CHOICES:  filename, none      DEFAULT:  none
               WRITTEN AS:    Logfile:filename
               HyperProtocol will maintain a log of each file transfer
               including time and date, the duration of the transfer and
               whether it was successful.  If you want a log file,
               specify the name of the file.  For instance, a typical
               command is LOGFILE:C:\HYPER.LOG.  (If you specify a
               filename without a path, the log file will be located in
               same directory as HYPERP.EXE.)
 
Overwrite      CHOICES:  On, Off             DEFAULT:  Off
               WRITTEN AS:    Overwrite:ON
               HyperProtocol won't overwrite an existing file unless you
               specify the OVERWRITE:ON command.

Port           CHOICES:  1, 2, 2E8(3), 3E8(4)   DEFAULT:  1  (i.e., COM1)
               WRITTEN AS:    Port:2  or  Port:2E8(4)
               This selects the serial port where your modem is located. 
               If you are using COM2, just type in 2.  With serial ports 
               higher than COM2 on a PS/2 or other MicroChannel 
               computers, you can just type 3 through 8.  With serial 
               ports higher than COM2 on an IBM PC, XT, AT or 386 
               compatible computers, you must specify the ADDRESS and 
               the INTERRUPT LEVEL.  Common entries are:

                  Port:3E8(4)   for COM3 using interrupt level 4
                  Port:2E8(3)   for COM4 using interrupt level 3

Suspend        CHOICES:  On, Off             DEFAULT:  Off
               WRITTEN AS:    Suspend:ON
               If you have a computer that can't receive data reliably
               while writing to a disk drive, set this to ON.  SUSPEND
               signals the sending computer to halt transmission while
               your disk is saving data.  You need to do this if you get
               several retransmission requests, even on noise-free lines.

Timestamp      CHOICES:  On, Off             DEFAULT:  On
               WRITTEN AS:    Timestamp:OFF
               When Timestamp is ON, a file is saved on your disk with
               the time and date you received it.  Turning timestamp OFF
               saves the file with the same date that appears on the
               sending computer.


EXAMPLES       Here are some examples of HyperProtocol commands.

Example 1      High-speed MNP modem located at COM2.  You want a log 
               file saved in the same directory as the HyperProtocol 
               module. Receive a file with the same name the sender uses.
               
               HYPERP PORT:2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS LOGFILE:HYPERP.LOG RECEIVE
               |____| |____| |_______________| |________________| |_____|
                 |      |           |                |               |

                        |                            |        specified)
                        |                            |
                  Selects COM2               Creates log file


Example 2      Sending a file to another computer.

                             HYPERP SEND C:\TABLE.DOC
                             |____| |__| |__________|
                                |    |        |
               Starts HyperProtocol  |     Filename
                               Sends a file


Example 3      Receiving a file that will replace existing files.
               File creation date will be the time you received it.

               HYPERP OVERWRITE:ON TIMESTAMP:ON RECEIVE C:\TABLE.DOC
               |____| |__________| |__________| |_____| |__________|
                 |         |             |         |         |
     Starts HyperProtocol  |        Save with      |      Filename
                           |        receipt time   |
                     Command to replace           Receives
                     files having the same        a file
                     name

               NOTE: If you specify a single FILENAME, you can receive 
               only one file.  If you specify a DIRECTORY name, you can 
               receive multiple files.



AUTOMATING HYPERPROTOCOL OPTIONS

HyperProtocol's versatility makes it simple to tailor for your uses.  
Since most of the options you use are the same each time, using batch 
files to start the module can save you time and keystrokes.  While 
batch files are merely an optional convenience if you're using HYPERP 
with a comm program, they are mandatory when integrating the module 
with some BBS software.

Batch files are easy, once you get the basic idea.  Suppose you wanted 
to use a batch file to issue:

     HYPERP PORT:2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS RECEIVE <any filename>

To do this, you could create a batch file named HREC.BAT, containing 
the same line, but with %1 in place of <any filename>:

     HYPERP PORT:2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS RECEIVE %1

Now, instead of entering the full HYPERP command, you would merely 
enter HREC followed by the desired filename.  Entering HREC TABLE.DOC, 
for example, would execute HYPERP and cause it to receive TABLE.DOC.

For sending files, you could create a similar batch file named 
HSEND.BAT, containing the following:

     HYPERP PORT:2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS SEND %1

To send a file, you would simply enter HSEND followed by the desired 
filename.  Entering HSEND TABLE.DOC, for example, would execute HYPERP 
and cause it to send TABLE.DOC.

Simple batch files like those above work fine in many cases.  However, 
some comm programs and BBS software start external protocol modules by 
passing baud rate, port, and other values along with the filename.  For 
each additional value that the software passes, the batch files must 
contain one additional variable (%2, %3, etc).  The first value passed 
replaces %1, the second replaces %2, etc.  For example, a batch file 
for use with BBS software that passes a port specification, baud rate, 
then filename might contain the following line:

     HYPERP PORT:%1 BAUD:%2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS DISPLAY:OFF RECEIVE %3

And HSEND.BAT might contain:

     HYPERP PORT:%1 BAUD:%2 HANDSHAKE:RTS/CTS DISPLAY:OFF SEND %3

Here, the first value passed by the BBS software (the port 
specification) would replace %1, the second value (baud rate) would 
replace %2, and the third value (filename) would replace %3.

To create batch files for use with your particular BBS software or comm 
program, you must know how many values the software passes, and in 
which order they are passed.  If unsure, you can find out by performing 
a test.  To begin, create a batch file named TEST.BAT, containing the 
following lines:

    echo Argument 1 is %1
    echo Argument 2 is %2
    echo Argument 3 is %3
    echo Argument 4 is %4
    echo Argument 5 is %5
    echo Argument 6 is %6
    echo Argument 7 is %7
    echo Argument 8 is %8
    pause

Set up your BBS software or comm program so that it will execute 
TEST.BAT as if it were an external protocol module.  Next, start the 
BBS software or comm program and cause it to run TEST.BAT.  Instead of 
doing a file transfer, TEST.BAT will merely display the values passed 
by your software.  Once you have this information, you can write 
suitable batch files.
