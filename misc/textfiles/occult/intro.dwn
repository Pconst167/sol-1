                      WHAT IS D.A.W.N.?

          The Denver Area Wiccan Network is a group of pagans and 
friends from a wide variety of Craft traditions.  DAWN sponsors 
parties, group rituals, a student/teacher network, and other 
activities as inspired or impelled.


WHY DO I WANT TO JOIN DAWN?
*    You want to be part of an active, growing community of 
     Wiccans who can work together to make some changes in their 
     world;
*    You want to meet people and make new friends who share your 
     basic values--people you can be yourself with, no need to 
     keep your cover;
*    You want an ongoing opportunity to exchange views and 
     information with people from groups or traditions other than 
     your own;
*    You want to be in on the creation of a Denver pagan extended 
     family which will make all the above possible;
*    You like hugs, and you enjoy being warmly welcomed.  

     
DO I HAVE TO "GO PUBLIC" TO BE A MEMBER?
     No.  Only the Board Chair and Secretary are expected to be 
"public," and the identities of all other members are fiercely 
protected.


HOW DO I JOIN?
     Dues are $13 per coven, $5 per solitary, payable twice 
yearly in May and November.  These cover the cost of mailings and 
the setup costs for parties and rituals, as well as other costs 
authorized by the Board and/or Steering Committee.


DO I HAVE TO JOIN DAWN TO PARTICIPATE?
     No.  All parties are open to pagans and friends.  To find 
out about them and other DAWN functions, write us at the P.O. Box 
listed below (postage is appreciated) or call Bob Key on his 
answering machine.  Another way to find out more about DAWN is to 
show up at one of our Steering Committee meetings. They are held 
at 6:30 pm, the second Sunday of each month, at the Glendale 
Community Center (999 S. Clermont).
