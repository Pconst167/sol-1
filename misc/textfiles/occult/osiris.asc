                   THE OSIRIS GOD-FORM RITUAL

                     By Dr. Israel Regardie

                   From "The Sceptre of Power"
                (New Falcon Publications, U.S.A.)

                          Issued by the
                       Thelemic Order and
                    Temple of the Golden Dawn

                  (With substitute material by
              David Cherubim for use of Thelemites,
       thus it is also called "The Horus God-form Ritual")

(Note that the particular God-Form that Thelemites should adopt
in this Ritual is that of Harpocrates, who is the Child Horus and
the Lord of Silence.)

1. Perform the Banishing Ritual.

2. Invoke the Four Elements and Spirit. (Osiris is not only the
Lord of the Underworld, but is also the Lord of the Elementals.
He is the Lord of Fire, Water, Air and Earth.) (Note: Horus is
also the Lord of the Elements, symbolized by the Blazing
Pentagram.)

3. Face East. Withdraw yourself into the centre of the room.

4. Make Spirit Symbol.  Plunge dagger into the centre of Symbol
and vibrate:

                      JEHESHUAH  JEHOVOSHAH

                      (or HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT)

5. Sit down and assume the Osiris (or Horus) God-form and expand
in size. While holding the God-form should the mind wander, bring
it back with the repeated invoking of the Coptic pronunciation of
Osiris -- pronounced "Ae - shoo - rist" (or invoke "Hoor-Paar-
Kraat").

6. See the pale golden aura (or Blue Egg) around you. Be sure to
keep everything in proportion as you expand. And be sure to be
porous.

7. See yourself as Osiris (or the Child Horus).

8. Then say the four Prayers of the Elementals.

9. Then say the Invocation "Unto Thee, Sole Wise, etc."

10. After the last line "Let the White Brilliance of the Spirit
descend", vibrate:   (after bringing the Light down)

            EXARP       HCOMA       NANTA       BITOM

11. Keep on vibrating "Ae - shoo - rist"  (or "Hoor-Paar-Kraat")
through the Ceremony and after. It awakens something inside that
corresponds to the form. You are making use of a highly integral
system to assume form. You are evoking something that has always
been there.

1st Variation
(For use of Osiris God-form only)

Use your own imagination for embellishments. Apply the Golden
Dawn method. See yourself lying in a coffin; and after the
Invocation of the Light, see yourself then as standing out of it
with just your feet in the coffin. It is a burial place and
initiatory Temple.

2nd Variation
(For use of either God-form)

After having clothed yourself with the God-form, see yourself as
Osiris (or the Child Horus), and the aura as a ball of Light (or
Egg of Blue). Picture as vividly as you can, and vibrate the
names "Ae - shoo -rist" (or "Hoor-Paar-Kraat") and "Exarp, Hcoma,
Nanta, Bitom," and imagine the ball (or Egg) as vibrating.

12. Perform the Banishing Ritual.
