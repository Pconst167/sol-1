In  the Book of  Revelation,  commentary |   1. To Show What Must Come.
states,  that what John  has  written in |
Scripture,  is  nothing  other  than the |
revelation  of  Jesus Christ  which  God |
gave  to him,  to show  to his  servants |
things  which must shortly come to pass. |
And he sent and signified it,  signified |
it, by his angel unto his servant John.  |
                                         |
Now,  John bear  the Record of God,  and |   2. To Bless the Reader.
the Word of Christ,  and  of  all things |
that  he saw.  In the  first  chapter of |
Revelation it says, "Blessed is the man, |       Rev. 1:3
.. blessed is he that readeth, and they |
that  hear the  words of  this prophecy, |
and those who "keep" the things that are |
written  therein,  for  the  time  is at |
hand."                                   |
                                         |
The Scripture states John writes this to |   3. To Address the Churches.

we  must  understand  that  we're not in |
Asia.  These churches once existed  long |
ago,  being  beneficiaries of  the power |
and the gifts of the gospel. It was ori- |

Some knew him  as  Jesus Christ;  others |
knew him by the name -- Yeshua.          |

here at Mount Carmel. One point I'd like |    a. Record of Christ's life.
to bring out before we continue, is that |
if we take a look at Matthew, Mark, Luke |       The Gospel Writers.
and John,  we see  the  "burden of these |

the burden of mind and spirit, to put in |
a scriptural record,  their personal ex- |

But sad to say, if we take a look of the |    a. Left Juda under threat of
Record of John,  the `Gospel Writer'  of |       death.
John, say Chapter 7. We see in Scripture |
John writes  that after certain  events, |       John 7:1
after  these  things  "Jesus  walked  in |
Galilee:"  he would not walk openly, "he |       Koresh is quoting the Bible,
would not walk  in Jewry,"  he would not |       from the Book of John.
walk amongst the Jews, "because the Jews |
sought to kill him."   We  might  wonder |
why?  Wasn't Christ a such a good man??  |
                                         |
"Now the Jews' Feast of Tabernacles  was |    b. His own brethren doubt him.
at hand. His brethren therefore said un- |       John 7:2
to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, |       John 7:3
that  thy disciples  also  may  see  thy |
works  that thou doeth.  For there is no |       John 7:4
man that doeth any thing in secret,  and |
he himself  seeketh  to be known openly. |
If thou do these things, show thyself to |
the world.  For neither did his brethren |       John 7:5
believe in him." Strange statement isn't |
it?  It's funny how that, when men live, |
and have to deal with realities of life, |
that even a man like Christ, can have to |
meet  with unbelief,  even  from his own |
brethren.                                |
                                         |
"Then Jesus said  unto them,  My time is |    c. Hated by the world.
not yet come:  but  your time  is  alway |       John 7:6
ready." And I'm sure most of all,  bible |
students  will agree,  the time referred |
to, is the time of his crucifixion. They |
wanted to kill  him,  and he didn't want |
to show  himself openly.                 |
                                         |
Then Jesus said unto them... <excuse  me |    d. You are of the world.
uhnn>, (Verse 7) "The world can not hate |       <Koresh seems in pain.>
you; but me it hateth, because I testify |       John 7:7
of it,  that the works thereof are evil. |       John 7:8
Go ye up  unto this feast:  I go not  up |
yet unto this feast;  for my time is not |
yet full come." When he said these words |       John 7:9
to them while he abode still in Galilee. |
                                         |
"But when  his brethren  were  gone  up, |    e. Went to feast in secret.
then went he also up unto the feast, not |       John 7:10
openly,  but as it were in secret."  You |
would wonder why a man like Christ would |
have something  to hide?  I mean surely, |
the angels would protect him, obviously. |
A person  would  think  a  lot of things |
about this strange character, and dispo- |
sition of character.                     |
                                         |
But  we're sure --  being Christians  -- |    f. Caused contention.
that Christ knew what he was doing.  And |       Koresh is Christian?!
"the Jews [sought] him at the feast, and |       John 7:11
said,  Where is he?  And  there was much |       John 7:12
murmuring  among  the people  concerning |
him: [for] some said,  He is a good man: |       Rev. 7:1
others said, Nay; but he deceiveth * the |       * <child cries>
people.  Howbeit  no man spake openly of |       John 7:13
him for fear of the Jews."               |
                                         |
Now we understand *the Jews at that time |    g. Backdrop: Corrupt leaders.
had  their own  religious-political net- |
work,  didn't  they?  They  were  pretty |
strong  in the religious spectrum, * al- |       * <child's voice>
though  they  had  no  actual  political |
power.  They were subject  to  the Roman |
government,  and not  to their own judi- |
cial/levitical laws.                     |
                                         |   2. Taught with Authority.
                                         |
"Now about the midst of the feast  Jesus |    a. The people marvel.
went up  into  the temple,  and  taught. |       John 7:14
And  the  Jews  marvelled,  saying,  How |       John 7:15
knoweth this man letters,  having  never |
learned?" * Now in the days of Israel, * |       * <child whines>
most scholars * and teachers will agree, |       * <child crying>
* that  the schools of Israel,  ordained |       * <tape off & on>
by the Sanhedrin and also the Pharisees, |
were schools  similar  to the uhh,  ones |
of our own theological schools of today. |
                                         |
Of which  the careful student  of Scrip- |    b. Insights to Scripture.
ture observes,  that nowhere is it writ- |
ten in the gospel  that Christ  ever at- |
tended these schools.  But at the age of |
12,  he did enter  into the temple,  and |       Luke 2:41-47
had  a most unique  and interesting dis- |
cussion with  the religious leaders,  of |
which they were  quite amazed at, such a |
young lad's knowledge of Scripture.      |
                                         |
Now this man  was teaching  something -- |    c. For it was God's teachings.
(no doubt Christ that is)  that inspired |
the  people  to  say,  (you know),  "How |       John 7:15 cont.
knoweth  this  man  (you  know)  letters |
having  never learned?"  They  marveled. |
"Jesus answered them and [said], My doc- |       John 7:16
trine  is not  mine,  but his that  sent |
me."  Now, what does that mean? "My doc- |
trine is not mine, but his that sent me. |
If any man,  will" (do the will) "do his |
will,  he shall know  [of] the doctrine, |
whether it be of God, or whether I speak |
of myself."                              |

Now friends,  people that love the Lord, |       There's a short break
this  is where  we begin  to uhhh,  talk |       from the message about
about some serious things.               |       Christ here.
                                         |
I'm sure you're all aware of how...  how |
I'm  involved  in a  very serious  thing |
right now,  and  I'm sure that  a lot of |
you  realize  that I should  be possibly |
scared, concerned. There's women, child- |
ren, and men involved,  in our situation |
here  at Mount Carmel.  But  I am really |
concerned about the lives of my brethren | <- Concern for family.

greater, about the lives of all those in | <- Concern for rest of world.

                                         |
You know, without Christ, without Jesus, |    a. God's law of righteousness.
we have no hope.  Why?  Well, because we |
know  that  the standard  of God's righ- |       Deu. 4,5,6
teousness is Law,  a law of the Ten Com- |
mandments,  a law of statutes  and judg- |
ments.  And which  God gave  unto  Moses |
on Sinai,  saying this is thy righteous- |
ness, O Israel.                          |
                                         |
But you know, God also gave another law. |    b. Sacrifice as a shadow of

ding  a poor and innocent lamb's  blood. |
So that  all who would break  the Law of |
God,  who would seek God for forgiveness |
and pardon,  had to bring a lamb,  some- |
thing innocent, and slay it -- although, |
Israel themselves  never really knew the |
real meaning of this.  Nonetheless, they |
were commanded to do it. Also there were |       Lev. 12:6
other sacrifices, such as: turtle-doves, |       Num. 19:2
goats, oxen, red heifers.                |       Heb. 9:12-14
                                         |
But,  it was  a  very sophisticated  and |    c. Social impacts. (An aside)
very prolific type system of worship. Of |
course,  God  had to  give  these people |
their own country.  He had  to give them |
blessings and things, to be able to per- |
form these,  rituals.  And  naturally of |
course,  having to slay a lamb  for your |
sins or such sacrifices, it would defini-|
tely keep a man on guard, not to sin too |
much,  because  otherwise  he could lose |
the livestock pretty quick, couldn't he? |
                                         |
Well anyway, (thanks be unto God),  from |    d. The Law and The Prophets
as far back as  Deuteronomy 32,  all the |       highlight God's mercy.
way through to Malachi,  there  has been |
other writings,  writings of  the Proph- |       God's writings are His
ets.  Writings who do not  usurp the au- |       Word
thority of Moses, but actually exalt The |
Law of Moses.  But yet  there's an addi- |       God's rock hard law

Heaven -- Who's rich in mercy -- has not |       God's loving mercy
only given to men a Law,  but also a way |
of escape, for those Repentant Souls who |
might fall short  of the glory  of God's |
law.  Which  some scholars  will  agree, |
that the glory of God's law is that it's |
a divine precept of  His  own character. |
God's character is revealed in The Law.  |
                                         |
Now, Christ is the only hope for a world |    e. Is Christ the Word of God?
that sins.  Now, how do we know? Well -- |
The  Prophets  --  have prophesied?  But |
what  if  we're  not familiar  with  the |
prophets?  Well, were the Jews  familiar |
with the prophets when  this Word-of-God |
was made flesh?  When Mary,  The Virgin, |
had  a baby boy,  did everyone  believe, |
that she was really a virgin when Christ |
was conceived?                           |
                                         |
If we search the Scriptures,  we'll find |    f. The Prophet's told.
in certain arguments  the Pharisees con- |
fronted Christ  --  and said to him, "We |       John 8:41
be  not  sons  born of fornication."  So |
obviously, not everyone believed that he |
was a  child of a virgin birth!  If they |       Prophets were ignored
hadn't  looked back to Isaiah chapter 8, |
and  learned  the  mystery  of  Immanuel |       Isa. 7:14
-- that a virgin would conceive and bear |
a son --  then they might not really put |
too much ahhm...  [con]sistency into the |       <tape off & on>
fact that Christ  at that day claimed to |
be born of a virgin.  I mean,  if Isaiah |
the  prophet was  a false prophet,  well |
then naturally they  would conclude that |
anyone  claiming  to have  these  things |
fulfilled would be false, too.           |
                                         |
But of course, Christ,  he did something |    g. Miracles confirm.
more, than to just fulfill prophecy.  He |
did miracles. Miracles of mercy such as: |
healing  the sick,  feeding  the hungry, |
raising the dead.  And if we study we'll |
see that "Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John" |
gives us in somewhat, a full view of the |
oppositions, and also, the confidements, |
that he had in doing these miracles.  He |
gathered many unto him through the means |
of these miracles.                       |
                                         |
But sad to say,  even though he had done |    h. Those healed believed.
so many  miracles,  Scripture says,  yet |
when it came right down to it,  they did |
not  believe in  him.  It's  amazing  to |
think that  even his own disciples  for- |
sook  him -- except Mary Magdalene.  She |
stayed with him to the very end,  didn't |
she?  Last to leave The Cross,  first to |
come to the sepulchre. * Now, we need to |       * <tape off & on>
sit here,  and we need  to ask ourselves |
the question,  `how come the men of that |
generation did not believe in Christ?'   |
                                         |
In Matthew 23,  Christ had to say to the |    i. Christ confirmed by Prophets
Jews "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem"  how often |       Mat. 23:37
I would have gathered you, but you would |
not.  Why?  He tells them that they have |       Not re-gathered, since
forsaken The Prophets.  "Thou that kill- |       they've forsaken the
est the prophets,"  how  often  I  would |       Prophets.  Has Christ

of `gathering Israel' and `the prophets' |
combine together?  Then  he  tells  them |
that their houses, their temple, is left |       Mat. 23:38
to them desolate.                        |
                                         |   4. Christ's Teachings on
                                         |      Last Things.
                                         |
And that in Matthew  24,  as Christ said |    a. What signs of his coming?
on  the Mount of Olives,  his  disciples |       Mat. 24:1-2
came to him secretively to ask him, con- |       Mat. 24:3
cerning these things. What should be the |
sign of thy coming and of the end of the |
world? Well, Christ begins to tell them, |       Mat. 24:4
let no man deceive you,  "For many shall |       Mat. 24:5
come  in my name,  saying,  I am Christ; |
and shall deceive many."                 |
                                         |
A lot of bible students think that verse |    b. Some willingly deceived?
refers to the people coming,  and saying |
that  they themselves are Christ.  Well, |
naturally,  if someone came  claiming to |
be Christ...  Christ covers that subject |
by saying that if any shall say, Lo he's |
"in the desert;" believe him not "go not |       Mat. 24:26
forth." If he is in the secret chambers; |
"believe it not."                        |
                                         |
But he goes on to say, that as lightning |    c. Certain signs.
shines  in  the east,  even to the west, |       Mat. 24:27
so also shall his coming be. And he goes |
on to add,  but "wheresoever the carcase |       Mat. 24:28
is,  there will  the eagles  be gathered |
together."                               |       The carcass of Babylon?
                                         |
Now, unless we knew what was on the mind |    d. Eagle's Nest??
of Christ,  the day he sat with his dis- |
ciples on the Mount of Olives,  and gave |
the  instruction  to  them according  to |
Matthew 24;  unless  we could  look into |
his mind,  we would only have  to specu- |
late, it would only be an opinion to try |
to figure out what it means, "wheresoev- |       Mat. 24:28
er the carcase is, the  eagles..."  What |
carcass?  Whose  carcass?  What  eagles? |
What are the eagles?                     |
                                         |
Well,  Christ tells you of many signs in |    e. Abomination of Desolation.
Matthew 24.  He says, "when ye shall see |       Mat. 24:15
the abomination of desolation, spoken of |
by Daniel the prophet, stand in the Holy |
Place, (of course, it says ye that read- |
eth, let him understand),  those who are |

Apostles,  who by mercy  through Christ, |
were  given  another  chance  to recover |
from  their  folly;  we learned  through |
Romans  that there is a righteousness of |       Rom. 3:21-28

And finally,  we end  up in the  Book of |    b. John's controversy -- The
Revelation, where John, (the last living |       Testimony of Jesus Christ.

we've heard the writings of the apostles.|
But,  sad to say,  the religious leaders |
of  his days,  and  the majority  of the |
populace  of his days,  didn't think so. |
It's funny  how  that is.  It's  kind of |       Mat. 23:27-34

                                         |
Finally, we get to the fourth chapter of |   1. Throne Room.
Revelation. And the student of Scripture |
becomes interested in the subject, which |
according to John says, "After..." these |
things, (of course,  he was referring to |          Rev. 3:20
the last part of the 3rd chapter, of the |       "I stand at the door

                                         |
He says  after  these things, <I fol...> |   2. John Enters Heaven.
"And, behold, a door was open in heaven: |       Rev. 4:1
and  the first voice  which" spake to me |
"as it were of a trumpet,"  talked  with |       Col. 4:3
me;  which says,  "come up hither, and I |
will shew" you that "which must be here- |
after."                                  |
                                         |
Now,  the question to every true  Chris- |   3. Do You Believe?
tian is this:  Is John  telling it  as a |
truth,  or is John lying to us?  We know |
he just gave counsels  to the 7 churches |
of Asia, (which were alive and hopefully |
in good health, when he first gave these |
letters to them).  But nonetheless, they |
being of Asia, are no wise the same peo- |
ple of us today, or even of the oncoming |
years thereafter.                        |

sent to him stated that he'd be taken up |       Rev. 4:1

                                         |
Now what does he behold? In chapter 4 of |   1. John in the Spirit.
Revelation,  he says that  he was in the |
spirit, "immediately I was in the spirit:|       Rev. 4:2
and, behold, a throne was set in heaven."|
And h e states that the throne was occu- |
pied, "one sat on the throne."           |
                                         |
And, He that sat upon the Throne,  which |   2. Is God the throne?

the way  through the Bible,  as far back |
as the days of Genesis, even to the pro- |       Deu. 32:4,15,18

                                         |
Now here we see in Revelation John like- |   3. In & Around the Throne.

                                         |
We continue on in chapter 5, to see that |   1. Scroll.
I beheld, John says,  "in the right hand |       Rev. 5:1
of him that sat on the throne a book" or |
a scroll  --  "sealed with seven seals." |
(Notice,  it's written on the inside and |
the backside.) Well the meaning of these |
things can only be speculated,  until we |
have solid proof, in other words, unless |
we were there  ourselves  to see it,  in |
detail.                                  |
                                         |
But,  what we are allowed to see  in the |   2. Congregation.
Scripture, (as John also beholds) [is] a |
mighty angel.  In this throne room  were |       Rev. 5:2
all these angels,  "[ten] thousand times |       Rev. 5:11
ten  thousand,  and  thousands  of thou- |       Psa. 68:17-18
sands," are called together.             |       Dan. 7:10
                                         |
And,  this  mighty angel  questions  all |   3. Mighty Angel Prosecutes.
those in heaven,  "Who is worthy to open |       Rev. 5:2
this book,  and to loose the seven seals |
thereof?"  Clearly Scripture states, "no |       Rev. 5:3
man in heaven,  [nor in] earth,  neither |
under the earth" (of course `buried'  in |
other  words,  we do  have dead  in this |
world,  you know),  was  worthy  to open |
"neither to look thereon."               |
                                         |
So hey!  God says in Scripture, at least |    a. God's living Book,
John testifies,  in Scripture,  that the |       written in our hearts?

                                         |

the meaning of these things. We see that |
God has a Book, which must be hereafter, |
(sometime after  John's day;  can-not be |

identified as [one] which must be in the |

Now let me review.                       |  E. A Short Review.
                                         |
Notice  how  during  the  6th seal,  the |   1. In Seal 6 -- Who Can Stand?
question is asked  in the time  of God's |       (note this)
apparent wrath,  who  shall be  able  to |
stand? "For the [great] day of his wrath |       Rev. 6:17
is come; and who shall be able to stand?"|       Psa. 76:7
                                         |
Notice, how  that in,  the next chapter, |   2. Sealing the 144,000.
chapter 7,  NOT  an  additional  seal is |       the tribulation harvest
opened, but an answer. John sees that he |
beheld "four angels standing on the four |       Rev. 7:1  9:4
corners of the earth,  holding  the four |
winds of the earth, that the wind should |       Rev. 9:4  8:7
not blow on the earth,  nor on the [sea, |       James 1:11  Deu. 29:23

                                         |
And he saw an  "angel ascending from the |   3. Seal of the Living God
east,  having  the  seal  of  The Living |       Rev. 7:2  9:4  14:1
God:"  What could that seal be?  Who  is |       2 Cor. 1:21,22  3:3

Does  the Living God  have some  kind of |       Deu. 6:8  11:18

                                         |
[When the]  7th seal  opens  --  there's |   1. Trumpets.
silence. And 7 angels and 7 trumpets pre-|       Rev. 8:1  (7 & 8  cf. 14)
pare themselves to sound. And it appears |       Rev. 8:2,6
that some terrible plagues  takes place. |       Rev. 8:7-13  9:1-12
What could these things mean? Well, just |
as there was  an interruption under  the |
6th  seal,  so is there  an interruption |       Rev. 9:13
under the  6th  trumpet.  Under the  6th |
trumpet we learn about  a mighty army of |       Rev. 9:16
200 million. What are they doing?        |
                                         |
Well,  we see,  that during the break of |   2. 7th Angel(?)
this in chapter 10, a Mighty Angel comes |       Rev. 10:1
down from heaven, "clothed with a cloud, |       Rev. 1:7  14:14  Mat. 26:64
.. his face ... as it were  the sun ... |
his feet are pillars of fire" and he has |       Rev. 10:2
"in his hand  a little book opened."  He |       Rev. 5:7
puts his right foot  on the [sea],  left |       Koresh reversed earth & sea
foot on the [earth] and cries and a lion |       Rev. 10:3
roars.  And  when  he had cried,  "seven |       Dan. 12:4,10
thunders uttered their voices." Now what |
are these  7  thunders?  What  do  these |
things mean?  How do we  categorize this |
book?  What  are  we really looking  at? |
Well...                                  |       <side 1 of source tape ends>

by anybody who would dare,  think,  that |
they,  can by  speculation,  or  private |
opinions,  unlock  the  mysteries of the |       Rev. 22:10...
seals  and  what they contain.  Remember |
the  events of  the 7th seal,  contained |       "Seal not the sayings of
from the 7th chapter on  -- the trumpets |        the prophecy of this book"
and the information thereof, just as the |
6th seal contains information thereof.   |
                                         |
Well then, what must be hereafter, after |   5. Hereafter.

What's  he going  to bring,  his reward? |       Rev. 22:12
What is his reward? Is it true in Isaiah |       Isa. 62:11  40:10
40 & 41 that, He's going to  come with a |
strong hand?  Who is the "Behold my ser- |       Isa. 42:1  40:10+

things mean?                             |
                                         |  G. The First Seal.
                                         |
Well,  we  know in  the  1st seal,  that |   1. Rider on the White Horse.
Christ opens it and we hear the noise of |       Rev. 6:1-2
thunder. One of the 4 beasts says, "Come |
and see."  And behold a white horse. "He |
that sat upon him  had  a bow;  [and]  a |       Zec. 9:13
crown was given  unto him:  and  he went |
forth conquering, and to conquer."       |
                                         |
Well,  in order to understand this seal, |   2. Christ's Secret.
we  have  to  find  out  a secret  about |
Christ. * In the counsel  to  the church |       * <tape off & on>
of Philadelphia, we see Christ addresses |
that church in chapter 3  of Revelation, |
with this message:  "And to the angel of |       Rev. 3:7
the church of Philadelphia write;  These |
things saith he that is holy ... he that |
hath the key of David,  he that openeth, |
and no man shutteth;  and shutteth,  and |
no man openeth."                         |
                                         |
Well,  what does he mean to this church, |   3. Key to the Door.
"I ... set before thee an open door, and |       Rev. 3:8
no man can shut it: for thou hast a lit- |
tle strength?"  What  could  this  mean? |
What  is  the  Key-of-David?  Isaiah  22 |       Isa. 22:20
talks about the Key-of-David, but it re- |
fers to  "Eliakim."  But still,  what is |
the Key-of-David?                        |
                                         |
Well, of ancient times, Christ being the |   4. God's Chosen King.
root and offspring of David. David was a |       2 Sam. 7
great  king  in  Israel.  And  David was |       (God's covenant with David)
anointed of God,  being  a shepherd lad. |
But through the power of God he was able |       1 Sam. 17
to  overthrow,  the greatest obstacle in |
his day, Goliath, the Philistine.  sing |

                                         |
Well, what happens is this.  We see that |   5. Psalms Record.
this  David  wrote 150  Psalms  that are |       Luke 24:44...

some scholars will agree, that there are |        - The Prophets
other psalms,  too.  But as  far  as the |        - Psalms
King James,  and the books of that cali- |

                                         |
Well, our  subject is  the 1st seal.  We |   6. Prophet's Account.

We  just  want  to  simply...  see if we |

                                         |

                                         |      The 45th Psalm.
                                         |
Well,  let's turn  in our Bible to Psalm |   1. God's writing.
45,  and let's see if we  can't get some |
kind of hint in  regards to what the 1st |
seal is. *  It states here  (this is the |       * <tape off and on>
King  James  Version)  -- "my  heart  is |       Psa. 45:1
inditing a good matter.  I speak  of the |
things  which I have made,  touching the |
king." What could it possibly mean? What |
does it mean,  "my heart  is inditing  a |       "indite" (rhet.) -- to write
good matter?"  Does that mean  "my heart |       down (a poem, speech, etc.)
is  inditing  a good  matter?"  Is some- |
body's heart  inditing  a  good  matter? |       Heb. 8:10  10:16
"I speak of things  I have made touching |
the  king."  Does that mean by interpre- |       Is this about God's Law (His
tation  "I speak  of  the things  I have |       righteousness),  written  in
made touching the king?"  Is our subject |       our own hearts and minds (as
about a king? Is our subject about some- |       a new covenant)?  Writing as
body's heart?  Is our subject about  "my |       in  Speaking The Word  --  a
tongue is the pen  of a ready writer?"   |       new "Living God" being born?
                                         |
Now, who is talking here? Well, natural- |   2. David Anticipates.
ly  David of Old is talking here -- cor- |
rect? Well, who is the king he's talking |
about? Solomon??  Well, let's see. "Thou |       Psa. 45:2
art  fairer than  the  children of  men: |       (also compare Psa. 72)
grace is poured into thy lips: therefore |
God  has blessed  thee for  ever." Well, |
Solomon was a wise man wasn't he? Ok, it |
says  here,  "Gird  thy  sword  upon thy |       Psa. 45:3
thigh, O most mighty, []  with thy glory |
and  thy majesty."  "And in  thy majesty |       Psa. 45:4
ride prosperously because of truth ..."  |
                                         |
I wonder what Solomon  rides?  Probably, |   3. Rider.
rides a horse, doesn't he? "...and meek- |
ness  and  righteousness;  and thy right |       Rev. 19:11
hand shall teach thee  terrible things." |
Huh?  I guess with a sword  in you right |
hand,  you could learn a lot of terrible |
things. Whoa (in verse 5), "Thine arrows |       Psa. 45:5
are  sharp  in  the heart  of the King's |
enemies;  whereby  the people fall under |
thee." Hmmm. Solomon doesn't seem really |
like  too  nice  of  a guy.  That is  if |
you're enemy.                            |
                                         |
But anyway,  "Thy throne,  O God, is for |   4. Thy Throne, Thy God.
.." (Huh? Wait a minute!)  "Thy throne, |       Psa. 45:6
O God is for ever and..."  (Now,  wait a |
minute.) Is David saying that Solomon is |
God?  No, he's probably just saying that |
God is God. Huh.  Well, why would a pro- |
phecy  about  Solomon  have  to  do with |
God's throne? "Thy throne, O God, is for |       Heb. 1:8
ever and ever:  the sceptre of thy king- |
dom  is a  right sceptre.  Though lovest |       Psa. 45:7
righteousness,  and hateth   wickedness: |
therefore God,  thy God..." (Wait a min- |
ute.) "...therefore God, thy God,"  what |
could  this possibly  mean?  Who is what |
God?  "Thy God,  hath anointed thee with |       Psa. 89:20
the oil of gladness  above thy fellows." |       Heb. 1:9
This is very strange, or is it?          |
                                         |
Well,  let's look at it  again  a little |   5. Key to God's Heart.
closer.  Scripture says that David was a |       "again"
man  after  God's  own  heart. (Although |       1 Sam. 13:14
David transgressed,  and that in no wise |       Acts 13:22
is like  God's Heart.)  But nonetheless, |
David was  a prophet,  and  he  was  in- |
spired.  Could it be that David was used |
by God to write down God's messages that |
would one day be revealed by Christ?  If |       Recall Psa. 45:1:
Christ does have the Key-of-David, would |       "My heart is inditing..."
he not be able to reveal -- the Heart of |       "My tongue is the pen..."
God?                                     |
                                         |
God in heaven looks to be a Rock,  does- |   6. The Law yields to Love.
n't he?  `Oh hard rock God, right. God's |       Rev. 4:3
long, God's hard...'  but wait a minute. |       Song lyrics perhaps??
Through Christ  we can see  that  God is |
not as hard as you think he is.  Look at |       Rev. 4,5,6
God.  Come up hither,  in  the light  of |       Keeping heart and mind
the judgment,  and see the Father on the |       on high.
throne.  See the book in his right hand, |
and  watch him  give it  to Christ,  and |
watch him open  the 1st seal.  And let's |
see about  this man  on  the white horse |
who has a crown and a bow.               |
                                         |
Now, God is the one who has written, "My |   7. From the Heart.
heart is inditing a good matter: I speak |       Psa. 45:1
of things which I have made..." Is God a |
maker? Is he Creator?  What does he want |       Isa. 45:6-12,18
to  talk about? [The] things  he's  made |       When God talks things
touching  the  king.  Who is  the  king? |       happen, as in:
Could  it be  Christ?  "My tongue is the |       "Let there be light!"
pen of a ready writer."  Did God write a |       Rev. 19:15
book?  Does God want  to talk about  His |       Isa. 29:11-12,18
Son according to a Book? Well, what does |       Rev. 21:27
God then think about His Son?            |
                                         |
"Thou art  fairer  than the children  of |   8. Living Word.
men." Well, if that's what  God  thinks? |       Psa. 45:2
Although, Isaiah 53 says, that they will |       Isa. 53:2
see in him no beauty or desire him; God, |
nevertheless  says,  "He is  fairer than |       Gen. 2:7
the children  of men." Why?!  "Grace, is |       John 1:1-5
poured  into  thy  lips."  Huh?  I guess |
whatever Christ says, those who hear it, |
will find grace, won't they.  Therefore, |
"God has blessed thee for ever."         |       All ye who heed the Word.
                                         |
Well. "Gird thy sword upon thy thigh,  O |   9. Inheritance.
most mighty." Is Christ the most mighty? |       Psa. 45:3  Eph. 1:17-23
"With thy glory and thy majesty," I mean |       Isa. 2:21
it seems like in Revelation all of Heav- |
en bowed before the Lamb,  did they not? |
That's a lot  of glory.  "For thou  were |       Rev. 5:12,13
slain to receive  power, honour,  glory, |       Rev. 7:9-12
riches,  wisdom, kingdom,  might," Oooh! |
That's a lot of inheritance there. Espe- |
cially in  the Gospel when  it says,  "I |       John 3:35
have  received  all  *  things  from  my |       * < cell phone rings>
Father.                                  |       John 13:3  Mark 28:18

"And  in  thy majesty  ride prosperously |  10. White Horse or Red Herring?
because of truth." *  So what could this |       Psa. 45:4
truth be? What truth, in the Bible talks |       * <tape off & on>
about riding a horse  prosperously,  and |
its truth? Could it be Revelation? Could |       Rev. 6:2 ??
it be the 1st seal?  Maybe a truth about |       Rev. 19:11
Christ?  Maybe a truth about him being a |       Rev. 19:12
king, (which is a crown)?  Could it be a |
truth, about him having a horse, riding, |
conquering, and to conqueror? Huh.       |       Christ or anti-christ??
                                         |
So because of truth,  the truth of God's |  11. God's Spirit Indwelling.

rides prosperously;  writes in truth, in |
meekness  and  righteousness,  "And  thy |       Isa. 35:5,8,16,17
right  hand  shall  teach thee  terrible |
things."  Oooh. Well, what's that in his |       Rev. 5:1
right hand -- a sword or a book?         |       Heb. 4:12-14
                                         |

Well, if this was a spiritual church, it |
would  seem  kind of  funny,  for God to |       Eph. 3:1-4,9-11  1 Pet. 3:22
tell the spiritual church, to forget her |
own people,  (which would be her denomi- |

would be...,  well I thought  her father |       Eph. 5:6-8

                                         |
Well,  let's break this down.  If Christ |  22. Children for God.
is the  Son of God,  if that's the case, |       Heb. 2:1
and if we all are sons of God  --  if we |       2 Cor. 6:16-18
believe in Christ,  then naturally every |       Hos. 1:10
girl would be a daughter of God wouldn't |
she?  Well,  we look up to the Father on |
the Throne,  of which  we want to exalt. |
We know that He is greater than all. And |
He's  Christ's  Father,  and  He's  also |
everyones  Father.  And  Psalms 83 says, |       Psa. 82:6 (should be)
God says,  I say you are gods,  "and all |
of you are children of the most High."   |
                                         |
Hosea teaches us, that we're to say, "Ye |  23. King and Law.
are not my people." There  it  should be |       Hos. 1:9,10  2:23
said,  "Ye are  the sons  of  the living |
God." So Christ says in the Gospels, "if |       John 10:35
he called them gods,  unto whom the word |
of God came," the Law can not be broken. |
                                         |
Well,  we're ruining  God's Word -- it's |  24. Word and Spirit.
God's Spirit.  This  is  what  makes  us |       Eph. 6:17  Rev. 1:16  19:15

Well even if it is Spiritual we know one |   1. Triangulation.
thing.  We know  -- that the servants of |
God know --  that Psalm 45,  is the very |
prophecy which must be hereafter accord- |
ing to  the 1st seal.  But just  to make |
sure we know it's going to be fulfilled, |
let's  turn in  our  Bible to REVELATION |       Yep. It's a sermon.

caption  of what  we are  really looking |

                                         |
Now  remember, in  the  18th chapter  of |   2. Babylon "The Great."
Revelation,  we  know  that Babylon  the |       Rev. 18

very bad happens,  and then in  verse 23 |
of Chapter 18  --  no more: light of the |       Rev. 18:23

saying, Alleluia;  Salvation, and glory, |

Isaiah 51 talked about judgments of God. |   5. Righteous Judgment.
Says something about, "HEARKEN to me, ye |       Isa. 51:1

seek the LORD: look unto the rock where- |

rock,  he's the only one who can make us |       1 Sam. 2:2

O  my  nation:  for a law  shall proceed |

Now,  we know that [what] the Law of God |   7. Forgive Them.

know  when God  sent  His Son  into  the |
world,  he was the Law  made flesh.  And |       Gal. 3:17
although  he  kept  the  law  perfectly; |
nonetheless,  he also  forgave  based on |
men's  ignorance.  "Father, forgive them |       Luke 23:34  1 Cor. 2:8

"Which did  corrupt  the earth  with her |       Rev. 19:2  17:2

So, we know  Babylon-The-Great  is a big |       Isa. 34:10
whore, right?  I mean,  she's not really |
very  faithful,  when  it comes to God's |
Word,  when  it comes  to knowing  God's |
Truth.  And  I betcha  she's the kind of |
person  that'll claim  to be with a guy, |

you think she made herself ready by deny-|

importance  of the Lamb  opening the 1st |

ready  by denying that Christ had a Key- |

                                         |
Now  let me  emphasize something  to you |   1. A Key-of-David.
again,  when you  read Psalms 1,  always |       Psa. 1:5
keep your mind  up-hither -- remember -- |       In other words, "on high,"
I'm giving you a Key-of-David now.       |       -- look first always for
                                         |          for God.
                                         |
I'll share with you. Every time you read |   2. Revelations and Psalms.
a psalm, like in Psalms 1,  the judgment |
is the one spoken of in Revelation 4 and |
5.  When you read Psalms 2, `the heathen |       Psa. 2:1
that  rage,  that imagine vain  things,' |
they're the ones whose thoughts are con- |
trary to the thoughts of God.  "Against  |       Psa. 2:2
the Lord, and against his anointed, say- |
ing,  Let us break  their  bands asunder |       Psa. 2:3
and cast their cords from us."           |
                                         |
You see,  when  the  Lamb  comes  again, |   3. Breaking the Bands.
there's only one way  to know who he is, |       What's important is that
he has to reveal the 7 seals.  `That men |       the Lamb knows you.
may not  be judged  by the law,  for all |       Rom. 3:23
have broken  the law  and come short  of |       Gal. 3:21-29
glory  of God.'  That they  be might  be |
judged by nothing more than Truth.       |
                                         |
'Cause, notice in Psalms 2, `the heathen |   4. God Judges the Nations.
rage,  and they  imagine  a vain thing.' |       Psa. 2:1-3
They  want  to stop  this  anointed one; |       <tape off & on>
`let us break  his bands asunder.'  What |
do you think that is? How many bands are |
there on the book? There are seven bands |
on the book. Why this is happening today,|       A seal is also a vow.
and He that sits in heaven,  (that's the |
Father you know), sitting on the Throne, |
He laughs.  He laughs while men begin to |       Psa. 2:4
make the worst mistake they've ever made.|
All the nations, from Babylon, to Persia,|       Psa. 2:5
Greece, and Rome, were judged by a judg- |
ment,  and they fell when it became time |
for God to make them fall.               |

Now, yes,  in Psalms 2 it says,  "I will |   5. Children of God.
declare  the decree:  the Lord hath said |       Psa. 2:7
unto me, Thou art my Son;  this day have |
I  begotten thee."  Well,  aren't we all |
sons of God if we hear the words of God? |
                                         |
Now,  the Psalms are not written because |   6. Warnings of Psalms.
Christ  is desiring  to destroy mankind. |
On the contrary.  The warnings of Psalms |
1,  in the light of the Judgment,  is so |
that men might fear, and receive redemp- |
tion.  The same  is  Psalms 2.  Absolute |
terrible warnings are given, such as, `I |       Psa. 2:8-9
will dash them  to pieces  with a rod of |
iron,' right?  We know that Christ would |
never want to do that.                   |
                                         |
But,  finally,  it comes  to a time when |   7. The Time for Judgment.
judgment must begin.  Clearly,  it  says |
`Now therefore  be ye wise,  ye kings of |       Psa. 2:10
the earth,  be  instructed  ye judges of |
the earth.  "Serve  the Lord  with fear, |       Psa. 2:11
rejoice  with trembling.  Kiss  the Son, |       Psa. 2:12
lest he be angry, and ye perish from the |
way,  when  his wrath  is  kindled but a |
little.  Blessed are  all they  that put |
their trust in him."                     |
                                         |
Now, ministers should show you where the |   8. The High Road.
