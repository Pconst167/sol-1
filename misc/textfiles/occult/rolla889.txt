r of 30 million "Gods", but these are 
(according to hindu scholars) sort of signposts, pointers to help you see the 
REAL god, who is in fact Brahman.  Krishna is one of the 30 million, who has 
incarnated at various points on the Earth...very important to Hinduism, but 
not *the* God...

Brahman manifests in two different ways.  Many worship etc. "Saguna Brahman," 
or "God with Attributes," who is a lot like God the Father -- a god who is 
personal, has some form of emotion, helps you out, looks basically human.  
The more *correct* or *exact* vision of God, however, is "Nirguna Brahman" 
(there will be a quiz on terms later), or "God wihout Attributes," who is 
sort of a cosmic electricity, everywhere in the universe, which is not really 
aware in our sense of the word.  Sort of a "essence of God-stuff" viewpont.

very interesting stuff, Hinduism.

66/71 # 110686   What's wrong with Xians
From: S'TALON on Sun Jul 30 12:58am

   There's absolutely nothing wrong with Christians or the Christ. Christ was 
a good being. It is his ministers and priests who abuse the teachings of 
Christ that most people abhor. Also, there is a difference between a 
Christian (like your standard Catholics, Lutherans, Episcopleans etc.) and 
your Bible thumpers (also known as Fundamentalists, Biblicans, Fosterites 
etc.). The thumpers cannot accept another religon, they think their faith is 
the only right one, and throughout history to the present day, they have 
tried to stamp out anything that disagrees with them. Also, they have a 
tendency to be preachy and never getting off your back.

                                              Blessed Be,

                                                  -S'Talon

 P.S. As far as the Jews are concerned, many people did not agree with the 
idea of monotheism and many kings of Isreal and Judah repressed people of 
different faiths. Those who surivived often went to the two Kingdoms' 
enemies, and it is thought that this help from exiles of Isreal as well as 
the corruption that often goes with theocracys and religous rulers that led 
to Isreal's downfall to the Assyrians and Judah's downfall to the Chaldeans. 
They might have fallen anyway, but those two factors made it a hell of a lot 
easier for those two nations to fall.

From: CAVE MAN on Tue Aug  1  4:29am

I beg to differ Tal, in that it is not the aformentioned groups that have 
failed to see the light and follow the Christ they claim. Rather it is the 
other way around, your personal clan does not make you a true follower or 
not, it is your personal interpretation.  I have an aunt who is a witness, 
yet she never hustled any of us kids and i didnt know she was a witness 
untill recently.  Why?, she was too busy living the christian life.  My point 
is, i think it is wrong to lump folks into a cast because of the way they 
were taught when they is the simple method of judging them by thier works.
      I also have to question the ranking of Krishna, Greek. (as if it 
mattered(which it dont)). The Braham came from a lotus that grew from 
Krishna's navel, and at the end of the really big cycle he will return.  He 
is outside of Kali's dance however, which is why he has to return to the 
lotus, because he is too big for Kali to cut down.   [] CAVE MAN []

  I can see that you have read some of the Kabbala but, you missed the whole 
idea of the Kether, Chcokmah, and Binah. You took them as the ""The Christian 
Trinity" which is quite incorrect. Kether being the Crown or "The All 
Archtypal World of the Hidden God".. The Ancient of Days of the bible hangs 
out their, The Ancient of The Ancient Ones, The Long Face, The Arikh-Anpin. 
Then there is Chockmah wich is Wisdom and the King. A fatherly dude he is. He 
should be since he would be considered a "Ahlim" or Elohim. Then you Binah 
which is the Queen and Bride of the King. She is Aima and is also 
Understanding. She is the Mother who has been pefected and assended unto the 
king like the Virgin Mary.
  Now, just from there it is a good arguement for Polytheism based upon the 
so-called trinty of your bringing up.
  Let us take the first line of the Zohar. The first word would be Berashith 
or Brashith which could be broken down as "He who created Six (referring to 
the Sephiroths or worlds or could refer to he who created 6 sephiroths in 6 
days, or He who created his 6 members in 6 days..  In Begining The Alhim or 
Elohim said Let us make man in our won image and our own likeness. The word 
Alhim or Elohim is a feminine noune with a masculine plural. It delibetly 
translated that way. It is defined as "King, Gods". Now how could Adam be 
made in the image of the Elohim, male and female, unless the Elohim were male 
and female also. The word Elohim ia plual from the feminine singular ALH, 
Eloh, by adding IM to the word. But, inasuch as Im is usually the termination 
of the masculine plural, and is here added to a feminine noun, it gives to 
the wod Elohim the sense of female potency united to a masculine idea, and 
thereby capable of producing an offspring.. Now by logic this should prove of 
some value..

71/71 # 110999   The Zohar...
From: SPIKE on Wed Aug  2  5:17pm

Jimi,
     Do you have a feeling we will lose some people with THIS one? <grin>
     First, let me point out that I do NOT adhere to the mystical Judaic 
beliefs in the Zohar.  You point out the Kether, Chokmah and Binah of the one 
God. <well, let's continue anyway>  I see the reference as pertaining to the 
Triune God in a rudimentary, if a little seperatist (three seperate entities 
in one), manner.  The Kether referring to the Body of God, the Incarnation, 
the Creator--Jesus Christ the Messiah, or the Fruit of Jesse, Son of David, 
Son of Man, Son of God.  The Kether is then both a physically manifest figure 
(the pre-incarnations at the burning bush, to Abraham, to Adam, and to 
Joseph; and the full revelation incarnation of Jesus of Nazereth; and the 
final judgemental revelation of Jesus, the Lion of Judah) and part of the 
spiritual unity of the "Godhead/Tri-Unity".  The Chokmah is the "mind of God" 
from which all things spiritual and eternal flow, the Almighty God, or God 
the Father.  The Binah, although the Zohar may use the feminine form, is part 
of the unity of the Godhead as well; this being the Spirit of God placed upon 
man (those without faith or the full revelation of faith) or within man 
(those justified by faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ).  I do believe 
that the Tri-Unity encompasses male and female aspects, but I do not seperate 
these aspects.  As it says in Genesis 2:24, the man and woman shall join as 
one flesh.  I believe that the seperate sexes CAN provide a means of, in 
union, glorifying God--all the more reason for the seperation.
     Oh well, I'm sure we WILL continue...
