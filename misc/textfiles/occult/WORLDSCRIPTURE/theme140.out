                              GIVING AND RECEIVING
                                World Scripture

                              GIVING AND RECEIVING

Passages in this section express the general spiritual principle of giving and
receiving.  When we give to one another, freely and without conditions, sharing
our blessings with others and bearing each other's burdens, the giving
multiplies and we receive far more than what was given.  Even when there is no
immediate prospect of return, Heaven keeps accounts of giving, and in the end
blessing will return to the giver, multiplied manyfold.  We must give first; to
expect to receive without having given is to violate the universal law.  On the
other hand, giving in order to receive--with strings attached, with the
intention of currying favor, or in order to make a name for oneself--is
condemned.  See also The Golden Rule, pp. 172-74.

Give, and it will be given to you... for the measure you give will be the
measure you get back.

If beings knew, as I know, the fruit of sharing gifts, they would not enjoy
their use without sharing them, nor would the taint of stinginess obsess the
heart and stay there.  Even if it were their last bit, their last morsel of
food, they would not enjoy its use without sharing it, if there were anyone to
receive it.

The Buddha said, "When you see someone practicing the Way of giving, aid him
joyously, and you will obtain vast and great blessings."  A shramana asked: "Is
there an end to those blessings?"  The Buddha said, "Consider the flame of a
single lamp.  Though a hundred thousand people come and light their own lamps
from it so that they can cook their food and ward off the darkness, the first
lamp remains the same as before.  Blessings are like this, too."

He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully
will also reap bountifully.  Each one must do as he has made up his mind, not
reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is
able to provide you with every blessing in abundance, so that you may always
have enough of everything and may provide in abundance for every good work.  As
it is written,
                    He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor;
                       his righteousness endures forever.

He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply
your resources and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be
enriched in every way for great generosity.

Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a
proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is enlightened
giving.  Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or
of getting something in return, is selfish giving.

                      17.Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 17.20-21

He who gives his wealth to purify himself,
and confers no favor on any man for recompense,
only seeking the Face of his Lord the Most High;
He shall surely be satisfied. 18Islam.  Qur'an 92.18-21

Enlightening beings are magnanimous givers, bestowing whatever they have with
equanimity, without regret, without hoping for reward, without seeking honor,
without coveting material benefits, but only to rescue and safeguard all living
beings.

If I give this, what shall I [have left to] enjoy?"--
Such selfish thinking is the way of the ghosts;
"If I enjoy this, what shall I [have left to] give?"--
Such selfless thinking is a quality of the gods.

Mencius said, "A man who is out to make a name for himself will be able to give
away a state of a thousand chariots, but reluctance would be written all over
his face if he had to give away a basketful of rice and a bowlful of soup when
no such purpose was served."

                       21.Confucianism.  Mencius VII.B.11

When a greeting is offered you, meet it with a greeting still more courteous,
or at least of equal courtesy.  God takes careful account of all things.

                             22.Islam.  Qur'an 4.86

There was presented to me a papaya,
And I returned for it a beautiful keu gem;
Not as a return for it,
But that our friendship might be lasting.

There was presented to me a peach,
And I returned for it a beautiful yaou gem;
Not as a return for it,
But that our friendship might be lasting.

There was presented to me a plum,
And I returned for it a beautiful kew stone;
Not as a return for it, But that our friendship might be lasting.

                    23.Confucianism.  Book of Songs, Ode 64

Love cannot return unless you give it.  People who love each other can continue
the give and take action of love with more power than they invest.  We can
conclude that the word "eternity" can only be formed through love.

Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life 8.125: This distinction between gods and
demons is made in Satapatha Brahmana 5.1.1.1-2, p. 383. Book of Songs, Ode 64:
It is commonplace for people to give gifts with the intention of securing a
favor in return.  In such calculations, the gift and its return would be of
roughly equal value.  To return a gift of immensely greater value might burden
the recipient with a feeling of indebtedness. This passage, however, describes
an exchange of gifts with a purer motive: friendship that goes beyond the
calculations of obligation.
