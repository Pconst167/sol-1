                                Cosmic Justice
                                World Scripture

                                COSMIC JUSTICE

In this section we treat the principle of cosmic justice and the law of cause
and effect.  The maxim that a person reaps what he has sown, the doctrine of
karma, and belief in divine retribution are different expressions of a common
principle that the world is governed by justice. This section does not
distinguish the specific manner in which justice will be vindicated; e.g.,
through one's fate in this life, through reincarnation into a being of a
different status, or through one's fate in the afterlife. For the latter,
regarding beliefs about heaven and hell, see Chapter 6.

The principle of justice bears the same ambiguous relationship to Ultimate
Reality as does divine Law generally.  In Judaism, Christianity, Islam,
Sikhism, and African traditional religions it is God who executes judgment to
maintain justice, while in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism the principle of
justice is inherent in the fabric of the cosmos and is distinguished from and
subordinate to the ultimate goal of Liberation.  In Chinese religion there is
both an impersonal Tao or Heaven which gives recompense according to principle
and Taoist deities who execute judgment.

More will be said in later chapters about the doctrine of karma, particularly
the accumulated Karma and Inherited Sin, pp. 694-702, as they impinge on the
present.  Karma may function to explain a person's life circumstances by
attributing them to conditions created in past lives; in that sense the
doctrine of karma functions analogously to the doctrine of predestination in
theistic religions.  Yet the Buddhist scriptures caution against interpreting
karma as a deterministic principle, and Hindu texts recognize that it can be
blotted out through grace.1 [1See p. 695].

This collection of texts begins with passages on the principle of cause and
effect, on justice as inherent to the nature of life.  The next group of
passages deals with the problem of the frequent delay between actions and the
ripening of their fruits.  The scriptures affirm that regardless of the delay,
recompense is inescapable, sometimes describing it through the metaphor of
Heaven's net.  One solution to this problem is that recompense occurs in
another life; here we offer several fundamental texts on karma, the impersonal
law by which the deserts of one's deeds are reaped in the next incarnation. The
next group of passages gives another solution, which is to envision that sure
recompense comes only at the Last Judgment. The final group of passages depicts
God, or his angels, as personally deciding and enforcing the judgment for one's
deeds.

Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will
also reap.

Our body in Kali Yuga is a field of action:
As a man sows, so is his reward.
Nothing by empty talk is determined:
Anyone swallowing poison must die.
Brother! behold the Creator's justice:
As are a man's actions, so is his recompense.

An ignorant man committing evil deeds does not realize the consequences. The

Men who acquire wealth by evil deeds, by adhering to principles which are

A man who has committed one of the deadly sins will never again, until his
death, lose the thought of that action; he cannot get rid of it or remove it,
but it follows after him until the time of his death.

        11. Buddhism.  Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines 17.3

I have acted, I have caused others to act, and I have approved of others'
actions.  One should first comprehend that all such actions taking place in the
world are the cause of the influx of karma particles, and then should forswear
them.

it.

Even if they attain to sovereignty, the wicked, engaged in cruel deeds,
condemned by all men, do not enjoy it long, but fall like trees whose roots
have been severed.  O dweller in darkness, as in its proper season the tree
puts forth its flowers, so in the course of time evil actions produce bitter
fruit.

                    14. Hinduism.  Ramayana, Aranya Kanda 29

Good fortune and misfortune take effect through perseverance.  The tao of
heaven and earth becomes visible through perseverance.  The tao of sun and moon
becomes bright through perseverance.  All movements under heaven become uniform
through perseverance.

               15. Confucianism.  I Ching, Great Commentary 2.1.5

As sweet as honey is an evil deed, so thinks the fool so long as it ripens not;
but when it ripens, then he comes to grief.

Verily, an evil deed committed does not immediately bear fruit, just as milk
does not curdle at once; but like a smoldering fire covered with ashes, it
remains with the fool until the moment it ignites and burns him.

                        16. Buddhism.  Dhammapada 69, 71

Let not their conduct grieve you, who run easily to disbelief, for lo! they
injure God not at all.  It is God's will to assign them no portion in the
hereafter, and theirs will be an awful doom....

And let not those who disbelieve imagine that the rein We give them bodes good
for their souls.  We only give them rein that they may grow in sinfulness. And
theirs will be a shameful doom.

                          17. Islam.  Qur'an 3.176, 178

Then I saw the wicked buried; they used to go in and out of the holy place, and
were praised in the city where they had done such things.  Because sentence
against an evil deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is
fully set to do evil.  Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs
his life, yet I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they
fear before him.

Further, as Heaven and Earth are the greatest of things, it is natural, from
the point of view of universal principles, that they have spiritual power.
Having spiritual power it is proper that they reward good and punish evil.
Nevertheless their expanse is great and their net is wide-meshed. There is not
necessarily an immediate response as soon as this net is set in operation.

Everything is given on pledge, and a net is spread for all the living; the shop
is open; and the dealer gives credit; and the ledger lies open; and the hand
writes; and whosoever wishes to borrow may come and borrow; but the collectors
regularly make their daily round, and exact payment from man whether he be
content or not; and they have that whereon they can rely in their demand; and
the judgment is a judgment of truth; and everything is prepared for the feast

Though they dig into Sheol,
from there shall my hand take them;
though they climb up to heaven,
from there I will bring them down.
Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel,
from there I will search out and take them;
and though they hide from my sight at the bottom of the sea,
there I will command the serpent, and it shall bite them.
And though they go into captivity before their enemies,
there I will command the sword, and it shall slay them;
and I will set my eyes upon them for evil and not for good.

                23. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Amos 9.2-4

According as one acts, according as one conducts himself, so does he become.
The doer of good becomes good.  The doer of evil becomes evil. One becomes
virtuous by virtuous action, bad by bad action.

But people say, "A person is made [not of acts, but] of desires only."  [I
say,] as his desire, such is his resolve; as is his resolve, such the action he
performs; what action he performs, that he procures for himself.

On this point there is this verse,

Where one's mind is attached--the inner self
Goes thereto with action, being attached to it alone.
Obtaining the end of his action,
Whatever he does in this world,
He comes again from that world
To this world of action.
So the mind who desires.

Pao-p'u Tzu: Written by Ko Hung (253-333), the Pao-p'u Tzu is among the most
important classics of religious Taoism.  It expounds belief in the Taoist
Immortals, the doctrine of retribution, and the use of alchemical means to
prolong life.  Abot 3.20: The image of the ledger is a frequent one; cf. Abot
4.29, p. 346; Qur'an 17.13-14, 39.68-75, 50.17-19, pp. 345-48; 69.13-37, pp.

Action, which springs from the mind, from speech, and from the body, produces
either good or evil results; by action are caused the conditions of men, the
highest, the middling, and the lowest.

A man obtains the result of a good or evil mental act in his mind; that of a
verbal act in his speech; that of a bodily act in his body.

In consequence of sinful acts committed with his body, a man becomes in the
next birth an inanimate thing; in consequence of sins committed by speech, he
becomes a bird or a beast; in consequence of mental sins he is reborn in a low
caste.

According to what deeds are done
Do their resulting consequences come to be;
Yet the doer has no existence:

So is the nature of actions.

Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.5-6: This classic text describes the principle by
which karma determines the site of reincarnation.  Cf. Vedanta Sutra 1.2.1, p.
338; Svetasvatara Upanishad 5.11-12, p. 696.  Laws of Manu 12.1-9: Cf. Vedanta
Sutra 1.2.1, p. 338; Maitri Upanishad 4.2, p. 696. Garland Sutra 10: This
passage reconciles karma and voidness.  A person is subject to karma only as
long as he dwells in the illusion that he exists as a self.  Intrinsically
empty of self, a person is like a clear mirror whose purity is not affected by
the reflections that impinge upon it.  Thus the person who courses in
enlightenment will not accumulate new karma, though he may still have to work
out the effects of past deeds.  Cf. Majjhima Nikaya i.389-90, p. 345 and
Anguttara Nikaya iii.33, p. 697.

Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more, in
vain would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the penalty on the Day of

And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according
to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of
their hearts were good, that they should also, in the last day, be restored
unto that which is good.

And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.
Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to
its natural frame--mortality raised to immortality, corruption to
incorruption--raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to
endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the
other on the other.

The Exalted One says, "There are no special doors for calamity and happiness
[in men's lot]; they come as men themselves call them.  Their recompenses
follow good and evil as the shadow follows the substance." Accordingly, in
heaven and earth there are spirits that take account of men's transgressions,
and, according to the lightness or gravity of their offenses, take away from
their term of life.  When that term is curtailed, men become poor and reduced,
and meet with many sorrows and afflictions. All people hate them; punishments
and calamities attend them; good luck and occasions for felicitation shun them;
evil stars send down misfortune on them. When their term of life is exhausted
they die.
