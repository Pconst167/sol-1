                                The War Within
                                World Scripture

                                THE WAR WITHIN

Religions have conceptualized the infirmity of the human condition as an
interior war between two opposing natures, one good and the other evil.  As
long as people experience this state of contradiction, they can neither realize
their divine self nor achieve a state of unity and wholeness. Paradoxically,
while people immersed in worldly affairs may not always recognize the war
within themselves, it is precisely in leading a conscientious life, when
striving to do good and be good, that this conflict comes to the fore.

The world's religions conceptualize this conflict in various ways.  The first
group of passages locates the two natures in the fabric of creation itself:
thus Zoroastrianism and Hinduism teach that the earth is a battlefield between
two opposing good and evil powers, and Hinduism and Jainism distinguish between
the divine Self and the material existence in which it is bound.

The monotheistic religions, however, cannot allow a dualism that locates the
conflict in the fabric of creation itself, for that would raise insuperable
problems for the doctrine of the unity of God.  They delimit these warring
powers to the carnal desires within the individual soul, or to the errant
spiritual influences which incite such desires--see Demonic Powers, pp. 435-44.
The next group of scripture passages hold this view: for example, Paul's
observation of the war between spirit and flesh and the Jewish doctrine of the
Good and Evil Inclinations.  Buddhism, which regards material reality as
resultant of mind and deals entirely on the level of psychology, likewise
emphasizes the war within the person, between its innate emptiness and the
fetters caused by craving for selfhood.  We conclude with passages expressing
the more general idea that the human self is often its own worst enemy.

This body is mortal, always gripped by death, but within it dwells the immortal
Self.  This Self, when associated in our consciousness with the body, is
subject to pleasure and pain; and so long as this association continues,
freedom from pleasure and pain can no man find.

                    1. Hinduism.  Chandogya Upanishad 8.12.1

Just as knowledge, in spite of it being intangible, gets obliterated under the
influence of wine, so the self, though originally intangible, gets its
qualities obstructed under the influence of tangible karma particles.  In its
state of bondage, the soul, though intangible, conceives itself to be tangible
[identical with the body].

                          2. Jainism.  Pancadhyayi 2.57

Two birds, united always and known by the same name, closely cling to the same
tree.  One of them eats the sweet fruit; the other looks on without eating.

Seated on the same tree, the jiva moans, bewildered by his impotence. But when
he beholds the other, the Lord worshipped by all, and His glory, he becomes
free from grief.

When the seer beholds the self-luminous Creator, the Lord, the Purusha, the
progenitor of Brahma, then he, the wise seer, shakes off good and evil, becomes
stainless, and reaches the supreme unity.

                    3. Hinduism.  Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.1-3

The First Fundamental Principle is the primary cause of the succession of
deaths and rebirths from beginningless time.  It is the Principle of Ignorance,
the outgoing principle of individuation, manifestation, transformation,
succession and discrimination.  From the working out of this Principle there
has resulted the various differentiation of minds of all sentient beings, and
all the time they have been taking these limited and perturbed and contaminated
minds to be their true and natural Essence of Mind.

The Second Fundamental Principle is the primary cause of the pure unity of
Enlightenment and Nirvana that has existed from beginningless time.  It is the
principle of integrating compassion, the indrawing, unifying principle of
purity, harmony, likeness, rhythm, permanency, and peace.  By the indrawing of
this Principle within the brightness of your own nature, its unifying spirit
can be discovered and developed and realized under all varieties of conditions.

There are two orders of creation: one divine, the other demonic.

                        5. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 16.6

Yes, there are two fundamental spirits, twins which are renowned to be in
conflict.  In thought and in word, in action, they are two: the good and the
bad.  And between these two, the beneficent have correctly chosen, not the
maleficent.

Furthermore, when these two spirits first came together, they created life and
death, and now, in the end the worst existence shall be for the deceitful but
the best thinking [Heaven] for the truthful person.

Of these two spirits, the deceitful one chose to bring to realization the worst
things.  But the very virtuous spirit, who is clothed in the hardest stones,
chose the truth, and so shall mortals who shall satisfy the Wise Lord
continuously with true actions.

                    6. Zoroastrianism.  Avesta, Yasna 30.3-5

The offspring of Prajapati were of two kinds: gods and demons.  Of these the
gods were younger and the demons the older.  They were disputing the possession
of these worlds.  The gods said, "Well, let us overpower the demons at the
sacrifice with the Udgitha chant [chanting the Sama Veda]."

They said to speech, "Chant for us!"  "Very well," she said.  So speech chanted
for them the Udgitha.  Whatever delight is in speech, that she chanted for the
Gods; whatever she speaks well, that is for herself. The demons knew: "By this
singer they will overpower us."  They attacked her and pierced her with evil.
The evil that makes one speak what is improper, that is that evil.

Then they said to the breath, "Chant for us!"...  Whatever delight is in
breath, that he chanted for the gods; whatever fragrance he smells well, that
is for himself.  The demons... pierced him with evil.  The evil that makes one
smell what is improper, that is that evil.

Then they said to the eye, "Chant for us!"...  Whatever delight is in the eye,
that he chanted for the gods; whatever beautiful he sees, that is for himself.
The demons... pierced him with evil.  The evil that makes one see what is
improper, that is that evil.

Then they said to the ear, "Chant for us!"...  Whatever delight is in the ear,
that he chanted for the gods; whatever he hears well, that is for himself.  The
demons... pierced him with evil.  The evil that makes one hear what is
improper, that is that evil.

Then they said to the mind, "Chant for us!"...  Whatever delight there is in
the mind, that he chanted for the gods; whatever he thinks well, that is for
himself.  The demons... pierced him with evil.  The evil that makes one think
what is improper, that is that evil.  Thus they afflicted the senses with evil;
they pierced them with evil.

Then they said to the Life Breath, "Chant for us!" "Very well," he said. So the
Breath chanted for them.  The demons knew, "By this singer they will overpower
us."  They attacked him and wanted to pierce him with evil.  But just as a lump
of earth is scattered when it strikes on a stone, in the same way they were
scattered in all directions and perished.  Therefore the gods increased and the
demons diminished.  He who knows this increases in himself and his enemies
diminish.

Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.1-7: The senses, though created good, are
hopelessly invaded by evil--cf. Samyutta Nikaya xxxv.28, p. 381; only the Life
Breath (prana) remains inviolate.  The prana is channeled through yoga; hence
it is through yoga and meditative disciplines that one can establish an
inviolate foundation of goodness within oneself. Qur'an 17.11: Prayer is an
expression of one's desire and intention; hence it is possible to pray for evil
either out of ignorance or insincerity.  Yet God does not necessarily treat all
prayers alike, for he looks for true piety; cf. Qur'an 2.177, p. 861.  Mohawk

By the fetters of envy and selfishness are all bound--gods, men, demons, nagas,
gandhabbas and every other great class of beings--so that although they wish,
"Would that we might live in friendship, without hatred, injury, emnity or
malignity," they still live in emnity, hating, injuring, hostile, malign.

gathers strength against him daily and seeks to slay him... and were not the
Holy One, blessed be He, to help him, he could not prevail against it."

I know what is good
but I am not inclined to do it;
I know also what is bad,
but I do not refrain from doing it;
I just do as I am prompted to do
by some divine spirit
standing in my heart.

                           18. Hinduism.  Mahabharata

I do not understand my own actions.  For I do not do what I want, but I do the
very thing I hate.  Now if I do what I do not want, I agree that the law is
good.  So then it is no longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me.
For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh.  I can
will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but
the evil I do not want is what I do.  Now if I do what I do not want, it is no
longer I that do it, but sin which dwells within me.

So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.
For I delight in the law of God, in my inmost self, but I see in my members
another law at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of
sin which dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am!  Who will deliver me
from this body of death?

Man should discover his own reality
and not thwart himself.

A person has the self as a friend

But if he rejects his own reality,
the self will war against him.

Mahabharata: These words are spoken by the evil King Duryodhana as he breaks
his promise to the five Pandava brothers to allow them to return from their
exile in the forest to claim five villages.  The 'divine spirit' is really an
evil spirit which affirms his evil intentions. Romans 7.15-24: Christians have
interpreted this passage in two ways: either Paul is describing his inner
struggles prior to his conversion, or he is speaking as a saved Christian who
remains in a state of contradiction.  In the former case, receiving Christ
brings wholeness and spiritual freedom, as the will becomes in accord with the
Good; cf. 1 John 3.9, p. 227.  The latter interpretation stresses that
Christians are still bound by Original Sin and hence must be subject to the
discipline of the Church; cf. Romans 8.23, p. 318; James 4.1-3, p. 416; 1 Peter

The Reactive Mind is a portion of a person's mind which works on a totally
stimulus-response basis, which is not under his volitional control, and which
exerts force and the power of command over his awareness, purposes, thoughts,
body, and actions.  Stored in the Reactive Mind are engrams, and here we find
the single source of aberrations and psychosomatic ills.

Beware! your clinging-to-ego is greater than yourself;
Pay heed! your emotions are stronger than yourself.
Your vicious will is far wickeder than yourself;
Your habitual thought is more characteristic than yourself;
Your ceaseless mental activity is more frantic than yourself.

Although enemies such as hatred and craving
Have neither any arms nor legs,
And are neither courageous nor wise,
How have I been used like a slave by them?

For while they dwell within my mind
At their pleasure they cause me harm,
Yet I patiently endure them without any anger;
But this is an inappropriate and shameful time for patience.

Should even all the gods and anti-gods
Rise up against me as my enemies,
They could not lead nor place me in
The roaring fires of deepest hell.

But the mighty foe, these disturbing conceptions,
In a moment can cast me amidst [those flames]
Which when met will cause not even the ashes
Of the king of mountains to remain.

All other enemies are incapable
Of remaining for such a length of time
As can my disturbing conceptions,
The long-time enemy with neither beginning nor end....

While in cyclic existence, how can I be joyful and unafraid
If in my heart I readily prepare a place
For this incessant enemy of long duration,
The sole cause for the increase of all that harms me?

And how shall I ever have happiness
If in a net of attachment within my mind
There dwell the guardians of the prison of cyclic existence,
These disturbing conceptions that become my butchers and tormentors in hell?

Mencius said, "How can one get a cruel man to listen to reason?  He dwells
happily in danger, looks upon disaster as profitable and delights in what will
lead him to perdition.  If the cruel man listened to reason, there would be no
annihilated states or ruined families....

"Only when a man invites insult will others insult him.  Only when a family
invites destruction will others destroy it.  Only when a state invites invasion
will others invade it.  The T'ai Chia says,

When Heaven sends down calamities,
There is hope of weathering them;
When man brings them upon himself,
There is no hope of escape.

This describes well what I have said."
