                            Divine Father and Mother
                                World Scripture

                            DIVINE FATHER AND MOTHER

Divine love and compassion is often expressed by the relationship of parent and
child.  The Jewish and Christian scriptures call God our Heavenly Father; in
the Lotus Sutra the Buddha is called Father of the World; and similar
statements are found in the Vedas and the Confucian classics.  In many
religious traditions Ultimate Reality is also recognized to be our divine
Mother.  Often God's Fatherhood and Motherhood are identified with Heaven and
Earth, which cooperate in the creation and nurturing of human kind and the
universe.

We may recognize from these scriptures that Ultimate Reality has the attributes
of both Father and Mother.  Even religions that restrict the vision of God to a
patriarchal image only, or religions like Islam that avoid using the language
of parenthood altogether, describe God's love in terms that can be said to
encompass both fatherly love--Creator, Teacher, Guide, and Savior--and motherly
love--Nurturer, Fount of compassion, and Sustainer.1

Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

                      1. Christianity.  Bible, Matthew 6.9

God!  Give us wisdom as a father gives to his sons.
Guide us, O Much-invoked, in this path.
May we live in light.

                         2. Hinduism.  Rig Veda 7.32.26

I tell you, Shariputra,
I, too, am like this,
Being the Most Venerable among many saints,
The Father of the World....
I tell you, Shariputra,
You men
Are all my children,
And I am your Father.
For age upon age, you
Have been scorched by multitudinous woes,
And I have saved you all.

1Islam's reticence about describing God as Father may be understood in light of
its strong rejection of polytheistic religions in which gods beget other gods.
Any language which could be suggestive of divine procreation--and the notion of
a heavenly father could be misinterpreted to give such a mistaken idea--is
avoided in the Qur'an.

Do you thus requite the Lord,
you foolish and senseless people?
Is not he your father, who created you,
who made you and established you?

He found [Israel] in a desert land,
in the howling waste of the wilderness
; He encircled him, he cared for him,
he kept him as the apple of his eye.
Like an eagle that stirs up its nest,
that flutters over its young,
Spreading out its wings, catching them,
bearing them on its pinions,
The Lord alone did lead him,
and there was no foreign god with him.

          4. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Deuteronomy 32.6, 10-12

You are the children of the Lord your God.

              5. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Deuteronomy 14.1

For all who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God.  For you did not
receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the
spirit of sonship.  When we cry, "Abba! Father!" it is the Spirit himself
bearing witness that we are the children of God, and if children, then heirs,
heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided that we suffer with him in
order that we may also be glorified with him.

                    6. Christianity.  Bible, Romans 8.14-17

Lotus Sutra 3: This stanza follows the Parable of the Burning House, in which
the Buddha, as a compassionate father, rescues his children from the burning
house of mundane existence by various means.  The image of existence as burning
goes back to the Buddha himself; cf. the Fire Sermon, p. 382.  The Buddha is
our parent by virtue of his limitless compassion--see Mahaparinirvana Sutra
259, p. 138.  Deuteronomy 14.1:  Some Christians stereotype Judaism as a
religion in which man relates to God as a servant to his master, whereas the
revelation of Christ opened for the first time the more intimate relationship
of a child to his Heavenly Father.  This is the negative side of Paul's joyous
experience of sonship in Romans 8.14-17.  Yet Judaism in its true expression
also seeks the intimacy of a parent-child relationship.  God already revealed
his abiding fatherly love for his people in the Torah of the Jews, in such
passages as Isaiah 1.2, 63.16, 64.8 and Jeremiah 3.19; cf. the Kaddish, p. 54.

kindly."

                          7. Islam.  Hadith of Baihaqi

God Himself told me that the most basic and central truth of the universe is
that God is the Father and we are His children.  We are all created as children
of God.  And He said there is nothing closer, nothing deeper, nothing more
ultimate than when father and son are one: One in love, one in life, and one in
ideal.

                8. Unification Church  Sun Myung Moon, 10-20-73

Why did God create the universe?  The reason is that God wants to realize the
relationship of Father and children centering on love.  So we can come to the
conclusion that the foundation of the universe is the relationship of Father
and children.

We are the children of our Maker
And do not fear that he will kill us.
We are the children of God
And do not fear that he will kill.

What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give
him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?  If you
then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!

Sun Myung Moon, 10-20-73: Our relationship with God includes the dimension of
empathy with the divine heart.  It should mirror--in its intimacy and through
comparable ethical norms--the natural relation of a child to his or her parent.

is likewise father and mother to the people.  Oracle of the Kami of Atsuta:
This notion that people are tied together with the kami and things of nature in
one universal family builds a sense of community and respect for nature.
