                      Transcendent, All-Pervasive Reality
                                World Scripture

                      TRANSCENDENT, ALL-PERVASIVE REALITY

This and the following sections describe the various attributes of Ultimate
Reality.  We have selected passages on the essential nature of Ultimate Reality
as transcendent and beyond all phenomenal existence.  They teach that at the
same time, Ultimate Reality is all-pervasive and immanent, the "ground of
being," the source of the energy within every atom and the life in every
creature.  Yet God's involvement with the world, even His immanence in all
things, in no way limits or affects His essential, absolute nature.  God's
glory fills the world, but the world cannot exhaust God.  Finally, we conclude
with some well-known theophanies which reveal, in a manner far more vivid than
is possible through theological conceptions alone, the transcendence of
divinity and the all-pervasiveness of Truth. Beyond the senses is the mind,
beyond the mind is the intellect, higher than the intellect is the Great Atman
[the totality of all minds], higher than the Great Atman is the Umanifest.
Beyond the Unmanifest is the Person, all-pervading, and imperceptible.

Katha Upanishad 2.3.7-8: The specific meanings of these successive levels of
reality are in some dispute.  The mind is the seat of emotion, perceptions, and
consciousness.  The intellect (budhi) is a finer faculty of enlightened
discrimination.  The Great Atman is understood by some as the Ego, by others as
the collective consciousness of all minds.  The Unmanifest is either the
undifferentiated consciousness of reality or Brahman in his attribute as the
seed of the causal realm.  The Person (Purusha) may be Brahman or the Supreme
Being.  For other Upanishadic discussions of four levels of reality, see Katha
Upanishad 3.13, p. 840; Mandukya Upanishad, p. 834.  Compare the Hadith of the
veils, p. 87; the mystical interpretation of Qur'an 24.35, p. 116; and the
Zohar's discourse on the nut garden, p. 324.

God! there is no God but He,
the Living, the Everlasting.
Slumber seizes Him not, neither sleep;
to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth.
Who is there who shall intercede with Him
save by His leave?
He knows what lies before them
and what is after them,
and they comprehend not anything of His knowledge
save such as He wills.
His throne comprises the heavens and earth;
the preserving of them oppresses Him not;
He is the All-high, the All-glorious.

                    2. Islam.  Qur'an 2.255: The Throne Verse

The Self is one.  Ever still, the Self is
Swifter than thought, swifter than the senses.
Though motionless, he outruns all pursuit.
Without the Self, never could life exist.

The Self seems to move, but is ever still.
He seems far away, but is ever near.
He is within all, and he transcends all.

The Self is everywhere.  Bright is the Self,
Indivisible, untouched by sin, wise,
Immanent and transcendent.  He it is
Who holds the cosmos together.

                        3. Hinduism.  Isha Upanishad 4-8

Some sing of His noble attributes and exalted state.
Some express Him through philosophical intricacies and ratiocination.
Some tell of His giving life and taking it away.
Some sing of His taking away life and giving it back.
Some sing of His transcendence;
To some is He ever manifest.
Millions upon millions discourse endlessly of Him.
Eternally He doles out gifts;
Those receiving them at last can receive no more.
Infinitely the creation receives from Him sustenance.
He is the Ordainer;
By His Ordinance the universe He runs.
Says Nanak, Ever is He in bliss,
Ever fulfilled.

"In what does the Infinite rest?"
"In its own glory--nay, not even in that.  In the world it is said
that cows and horses, elephants and gold, slaves, wives, fields, and houses
are man's glory--but these are poor and finite things.
How shall the Infinite rest anywhere but in itself?
"The infinite is below, above, behind, before, to the right, to the
left. I am all this.  This Infinite is the Self.  The Self is below, above,
behind, before, to the right, to the left.  I am all this.  One who knows,
meditates upon, and realizes the truth of the Self--such a one delights in
the Self, rejoices in the Self.  He becomes master of himself, master of
all worlds. Slaves are they who know not this truth."

Caesar said to Rabbi Gamaliel, "You state that whenever ten Israelites are
assembled, the Shechinah (Divine Presence) is found.  How many Shechinahs are
there then?"  Rabbi Gamaliel summoned the ruler's servant, struck him on the
neck, and asked, "Why did you permit the sun to enter the house of your
master?"  Thereupon the ruler replied, "The sun shines over all the earth."
Rabbi Gamaliel then said, "If the sun, which is only one of the hundred million
servants of the Lord, can shine over all the earth, how much more would this be
true for the Shechinah of the Lord Himself?"

There was something undifferentiated and yet complete,
Which existed before heaven and earth.
Soundless and formless, it depends on nothing and does not change.
It operates everywhere and is free from danger.
It may be considered the mother of the universe.
I do not know its name; I call it Tao.
If forced to give it a name, I shall call it Great.
Now being great means functioning everywhere.
Functioning everywhere means far-reaching.
Being far-reaching means returning to the original point.

Sanhedrin 39a: The saying about ten Israelites refers to the minyan, the
minimum number of men required to start a synagogue.  But the holy spirit
(Shechinah) can come among even two gathered together in God's name; cf. Abot
3.2, p. 271.  Tao Te Ching 25: Cf. Doctrine of the Mean 26, p. 80; I Ching,
Great Commentary 1.10.4, p. 121.  Chun Boo Kyung: God as the cause is one body,
but three in function.  These three spirits appear in the world of phenomena as
three poles: sung (character), myung (life), and chung (energy). Since the
essence of the one is infinite, the three poles are divided and yet undivided.
It is everywhere self-existing and omnipresent.  Another interpretation: the
three ultimate poles are manifest in the invisible world as internal character
or mind, external form or substance, and their unity as substantial beings; and
they are similarly manifest in the visible world as proton, electron, and
neutron.  Cf. Vishnu Purana 1, p. 82.

Divinity is that which was there before the appearance of heaven and earth, and
which gives form to them; that which surpasses the yin and the yang, yet has
the quality of them.  This Divinity is thus the absolute existence, governing
the entire universe of heaven and earth, yet at the same time, it dwells within
all things, where it is called spirit; omnipresent within human beings, it is
called mind.

In other words, human mind communes with the Divinity which is ruler of heaven
and earth; mind and Divinity are one and the same. Divinity is the root origin
of heaven and earth, the spiritual nature of all things, and the source of
human destiny.  Itself without form, it is Divinity which nurtures things with
form.

Buddha abides in the infinite, the unobstructed, ultimate realm of reality, in
the realm of space, in the essence of True Thusness, without birth or death,
and in ultimate truth, appearing to sentient beings according to the time,
sustained by past vows, without ever ceasing, not abandoning all beings, all
lands, all phenomena....

How should enlightening beings see the body of Buddha? (Dharmakaya) They should
see the body of Buddha in infinite places.  Why?  They should not see Buddha in
just one thing, one phenomenon, one body, one land, one being--they should see
Buddha everywhere.  Just as space is omnipresent, in all places, material or
immaterial, yet without either arriving or not arriving there, because space is
incorporeal, in the same way Buddha is omnipresent, in all places, in all
beings, in all things, in all lands, yet neither arriving nor not arriving
there, because Buddha's body is incorporeal, manifesting a body for the sake of
sentient beings.

matter.  He is the essence which is the reality of sensation, but he is not
sensation.  He is the essence which is the reality of intellect, but he is not
intellect.  He is the essence which is the reality of motivation, but he is not
motivation.  He is the essence which is the reality of consciousness, yet he is
not consciousness.  Like the element of space, he does not abide in any of the
four elements.  Transcending the scope of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and
mind, he is not produced in the six sense media...  He abides in ultimate
reality, yet there is no relationship between it and him.  He is not produced
from causes, nor does he depend on conditions.  He is not without any
characteristic, nor has he any characteristic.  He has no single nature nor a
diversity of natures.  He is not a conception, not a mental construction, nor
is he a nonconception.  He is neither the other shore, nor this shore, nor that
between.  He is neither here, nor there, nor anywhere else....

God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle,
Life, Truth, Love.

Science reveals Spirit, Soul, as not in the body, and God as not in man but as
reflected by man.  The greater cannot be in the lesser....  We reason
imperfectly from effect to cause, when we conclude that matter is the effect of
Spirit; but a priori reasoning shows material existence to be enigmatical.
Spirit gives the true mental idea.  We cannot interpret Spirit, Mind, through
matter.  Matter neither sees, hears, nor feels.

The Supreme Being (Purusha) is thousand-headed,

Such is His magnificence, but

Three-fourths of the Supreme Being ascended;

In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high
and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.  Above him stood the seraphim;
each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his
feet, and with two he flew.  And one called to another and said,

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
the whole earth is full of His glory.

And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and
the house was filled with smoke.  And I said, "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I
am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;
for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!"

Then the Buddha, wishing to enable all the enlightening beings to realize the
spiritual power of the boundless realm of the Enlightened One, emitted a light
from between his brows.  That light was called the Treasury of the Light of
Knowledge of All Enlightening Beings Illuminating the Ten Directions.  Its form
was like a cloud of lamps with jewellike light.  It shone throughout all buddha
fields in the ten directions, revealing all the lands and beings therein.  It
also caused all networks of worlds to tremble.  In every single atom it
revealed innumerable Buddhas showering the teachings of all the Buddhas of all
times, in accord with the differences in character and inclination of the
various sentient beings. It clearly showed the Buddha's ocean of transcendent
ways, and also rained infinite clouds of various emancipations, causing the
sentient beings to forever cross over birth and death.  It also showered clouds
of the great vows of t he Buddhas, and clearly showed, in all worlds in the ten
directions, the universally good enlightening beings' congregations at the
sites of enlightenment.  Having done all this, the light swirled around the
Buddha, circling to the right, then went in under his feet.

Jacob... came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun
had set.  Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and
lay down in that place to sleep.  And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up
on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of
God were ascending and descending on it!  And behold, the Lord stood above it
and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac;
the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants; and your
descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to
the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; by you and your
descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.  Behold, I am with
you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land;
for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you."
Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this place;
and I did not know it."  And he was afraid, and said, "How awesome is this
place!  This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of

the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet...  Then I
turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven
golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of
man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden girdle round his breast; his
head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a
flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace,
and his voice was like the sound of many waters; in his right hand he held
seven stars, from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was
like the sun shining in full strength.  When I saw him, I fell at his feet as
though dead.  But he laid his right hand upon me, saying, 'Fear not, I am the
first and the last, and the living one; I died, and behold I am alive for
evermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.  Now write what you see, what
is and what is to take place hereafter.'"

The word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land
of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the Lord was upon him
there.

As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud,
with brightness round about it, and the fire flashing forth continually, and in
the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming bronze.  And from the midst of it
came the likeness of four living creatures.  And this was their appearance:
they had the form of men, but each had four faces, and each of them had four
wings....  As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in
front, the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face
of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at the back.
Such were their faces.  And their wings were spread out above; each creature
had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered
their bodies.  And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go,
they went, without turning as they went.  In the midst of the living creatures
there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving
to and fro among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the
fire went forth lightning.  And the living creatures darted to and fro, like a
flash of lightning.

Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside
the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.  As for the appearance
of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of
chrysolite; and the four had the same likeness, their construction being as it
were a wheel within a wheel.  When they went, they went in any of their four
directions without turning as they went.  The four wheels had rims and they had
spokes; and their rims were full of eyes round about.  And when the living
creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose
from the earth, the wheels rose... for the spirit of the living creatures was
in the wheels.

Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament,
shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.  And under the firmament
their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each creature
had two wings covering its body.  And when they went, I heard the sound of
their wings like the sound of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a
sound of tumult like the sound of a host....

And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in
appearance like sapphire; and seated on the throne was a likeness as it were of
a human form.  And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it
were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about; and
downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were the
appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him. Like the
appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the
appearance of the brightness round about.

Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I
saw it, I fell upon my face.

ever higher, through heaven after heaven and glory after glory, approaching the
divine throne but never reaching even to its footstool.  The faces of the four
living creatures have become, in Christian tradition, symbols for the four
Evangelists.

Arjuna:
O Highest Lord, I wish I could see you,
your form as Lord,
Just as you yourself say you are,
Supreme Divine Being.
O Lord, if you think it is possible
that I might see you--
Then, Lord of mystic power,
show me your changeless self.

The Lord:
Open your eyes and see
my hundreds, my thousands of forms,
In all their variety, heavenly splendor,
in all their colors and semblances.

Look upon the Gods of Heaven, the Radiant Gods,
the Terrifying Gods, the Kind Celestial Twins.
See, Arjuna, countless marvels
never seen before.

Here is my body, in one place, now
the whole world--
All that moves and does not move--
and whatever else you want to see.

Of course, with the ordinary eye
you cannot see me.
I give you divine vision.
Behold my absolute power!

Samjaya:
With these words, Vishnu,
the great Lord of mystic power,
Gave Arjuna the vision
of his highest, absolute form--

His form with many mouths and eyes,
appearing in many miraculous ways,
With many divine ornaments
and divine, unsheathed weapons.

He wore garlands and robes
and ointments of divine fragrance.
He was a wholly wonderful god,
infinite, facing in every direction.

If the light of a thousand suns
should effulge all at once,
It would resemble the radiance
of that god of overpowering reality.

Then and there, Arjuna saw
the entire world unified,
Yet divided manifold,
embodied in the God of gods.

Bewildered and enraptured,
Arjuna, the Pursuer of Wealth,
Bowed his head to the god,
joined his palms, and said,

Arjuna:
Master!  Within you I see the gods,
and all classes of beings,
The Creator
on his lotus seat,
and all seers
and divine serpents.

Far and near, I see you
without limit,
Reaching, containing everything, and
with innumerable mouths and eyes.
I see no end to you, no middle,
and no beginning--
O universal Lord and form of all!

You, Wearer
of Crown, Mace, and Discus,
You are a deluge of brilliant light
all around.
I see you,
who can hardly be seen,
With the splendor of radiant fires and suns,
immeasurable.

You are the one imperishable
paramount necessary core of knowledge,
The world's ultimate foundation;
you never cease to guard the eternal tradition.
You are the everlasting
Divine Being.

There is no telling what is
beginning, middle, or end in you.
Your power is infinite;
your arms reach infinitely far.
Sun and moon are your eyes.
This is how I see you.
Your mouth is a flaming sacrificial fire.
You burn up the world with your radiance.

For you alone fill the quarters of heaven
and the space between heaven and earth.
The world above,
man's world,
and the world in between
Are frightened at the awesome sight of you,
O mighty being!

There I see throngs of gods entering you.
Some are afraid,
they join their palms
and call upon your name.
Throngs of great seers and perfect sages hail you
with magnificent hymns.

The Terrifying Gods, the Gods of Heaven, the Radiant Gods,
also the Celestial Spirits,
the All-Gods, the Celestial Twins,
the Storm Gods, and the Ancestors;
multitudes of heavenly musicians,
good sprites, demons, and perfect sages
All look upon you in wonder.

When the worlds see your form
of many mouths and eyes,
of many arms, legs, feet
many torsos, many terrible tusks,
They tremble,
As do I.

For seeing you
ablaze with all the colors of the rainbow,
Touching the sky,
with gaping mouths and wide, flaming eyes,
My heart in me is shaken.
O God,
I have lost all certainty, all peace.

Your mouths and their terrible tusks
evoke the world in conflagration.
Looking at them
I can no longer orient myself.
There is no refuge.
O Lord of Gods,
dwelling place of the world,
give me Your grace.

Bhagavad Gita 11.3-25 This is the climax of the Bhagavad Gita, when Krishna
allows Arjuna a glimpse of his transcendent form.  This magnificent theophany
continues with a vision of the fate of all the combatants in the Mahabharata
War, who rush headlong to destruction into Krishna's multifold gaping jaws or
sharp tusks; cf. Bhagavad Gita 11.26-34, pp. 1044f.  God is omnipotent and
controls all worldly phenomena; thus with the theophany comes insight into the
future, and Arjuna can have confidence in victory. But such a theophany is
rare, and only given to those who have eyes to see. Once before, in front of
Duryodhana and the assembled lords of the Kauravas, Krishna had displayed his
transcendental form in an effort to make peace; but they utterly ignored it and
showered him with insults (Mahabharata, Udogya Parva 43).
