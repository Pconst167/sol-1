                             HONESTY AND EXPEDIENCY
                                World Scripture

                             HONESTY AND EXPEDIENCY

This section deals with the virtues of honesty and expediency. Expediency is
not always compatible with honesty, and the tension between these two values
creates misunderstandings for the encounter of diverse cultures and religions.

The first group of passages deals with honesty as truth-telling; see also
related passages on Lying and Deceit, pp. 486-88.  The question, What is truth?
does not have a simple answer.  Truth-telling can sometimes mean to report the
facts of a situation, as in the correspondence theory of truth, but most
religious truth deals with ideas and realities beyond the level of fact.  Hence
a second meaning of truth-telling is to be true to the principles and doctrines
of religion, and to teach them truly.  It is an attribute of truthful words
that they be beneficial and instructive, not just factually true.  That is
probably the sense of truth meant by these passages.

The second group of passages deal with honesty as promise-keeping. In the
Abrahamic faiths, promises have often been sealed by oaths, sworn in the name
of God.  But as Jesus' admonition illustrates, oaths can be abused and sworn
falsely, particularly when the person does not truly believe in the God to whom
he swears.  All religions elevate promise-keeping as a central virtue of human
relations.

The last group of passages are on the topic of expediency.  Blunt honesty may
sometimes conflict with what is most helpful for a person; for example, in time
of war it may be necessary to lie to an enemy in order to preserve a life.  In
leading people to recognize the truth of religion, expediency may also be
required, for the truth is sometimes hidden in a package that is outwardly
unseemly.  Thus when Paul preached the gospel among Jews, he observed the
Jewish dietary laws--even though he himself was free from those laws--in order
not to cause offense.  The Buddhist doctrine of Expedient Devices, or Skill in
Means, as expressed in passages from the Lotus Sutra, attempts to reconcile the
various schools of Buddhism by showing that Buddha preached various doctrines
according to people's temperaments and inclinations.  In Nagarjuna this is the
doctrine of the two truths: relative truth and absolute truth.  It is first
necessary to grasp the relative truth of worldly phenomena before one can
comprehend the absolute truth which is beyond appearances.  But once the
aspirant has realized the deeper teaching--the absolute truth--and gone beyond
to realize enlightenment, the various outward forms of the teaching become
insignificant.

The seal of God is truth.

O ye who believe! stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to God, even as
against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, and whether it concerns rich
or poor: for God can best protect both.  Follow not the lusts of your hearts
lest you swerve, and if you distort justice or decline to do justice, verily

When man appears before the Throne of Judgment, the first question he is asked
is not, "Have you believed in God," or "Have you prayed and performed ritual
acts," but "Have you dealt honorably, faithfully in all your dealings with your
fellowman?"

                        15.Judaism.  Talmud, Shabbat 31a

If you plot and connive to deceive men, you may fool them for a while, and
profit thereby, but you will without fail be visited by divine punishment. To
be utterly honest may have the appearance of inflexibility and self-
righteousness, but in the end, such a person will receive the blessings of sun
and moon.  Follow honesty without fail.

              16.Shinto.  Oracle of Amaterasu at the Kotai Shrine

Tzu-chang asked about getting on with people.  The Master said, "Be loyal and
true to your every word, serious and careful in all you do, and you will get on
well enough even though you find yourself among barbarians. But if you are
disloyal and untrustworthy in your speech, frivolous and careless in your acts,
even though you are among your own neighbors, how can you hope to get on well?"

                        17.Confucianism.  Analects 15.5

When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a
pledge, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds
from his mouth.

                   18.Judaism and Christianity.  Numbers 30.2

Fulfil the covenant of God once you have pledged it, and do not break any oaths
once they have been sworn to.  You have set up God as a Guarantee for
yourselves; God knows everything you are doing.

Do not be like a woman who unravels her yarn after its strands are firmly spun.
Nor take your oaths in order to snatch at advantages over one another, to make
one party more numerous than the other.  For God will test you by this.

                           19.Islam.  Qur'an 16.91-92

You have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear
falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn."  But I say to you,
do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, or by the
earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the
great King.  And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white
or black.  Let what you say be simply "Yes" or "No"; anything more than this
comes from evil.

                        21.Judaism.  Talmud, Yebamot 65b

It is always proper to speak the truth.  It is better again to speak what is

The Duke of She addressed Confucius saying, "In my country there was a man
called Upright Kung.  His father appropriated a sheep, and Kung bore witness
against him."  Confucius said, "In my country the upright men are of quite
another sort.  A father will screen his son, and a son his father-- which
incidentally does involve a sort of uprightness."

                        25.Confucianism.  Analects 13.18

For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all, that I
might win the more.  To the Jews I became a Jew, in order to win Jews; to those
under the law I became as one under the law--though not being myself under the
law--that I might win those under the law.  To those outside the law I became
as one outside the law--not being without law toward God but under the law of
Christ--that I might win those outside the law. To the weak I become weak, that
I might win the weak.  I have become all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.

                    26.Christianity.  1 Corinthians 9.19-22

The teaching of the Dharma by the various Buddhas is based on the two truths;
namely, the relative [worldly] truth and the absolute [supreme] truth.

Those who do not know the distinction between the two truths cannot understand
the profound nature of the Buddha's teaching.

Matthew 7.6: A precious truth, a gift of God, should not be given to those who
would treat it with contempt.  Teaching should be given in stages, and to those
who are open to receive it.  Cf. Chuang Tzu 14, p. 620.  1 Corinthians 9.19-22:

Without relying on everyday common practices [relative truths], the absolute
truth cannot be expressed.  Without approaching the absolute truth, Nirvana
cannot be attained.
A wrongly conceived Sunyata can ruin a slow-witted person.  It is like a badly
seized snake or a wrongly executed incantation.
The Wise One once resolved not to teach about the Dharma, thinking that the
slow-witted might wrongly conceive it.

On a certain occasion the venerable Nanda, brother of the Buddha, the son of
the Buddha's aunt, thus addressed a number of monks, "Without zest I follow the
Brahma-life.  I will give up training and go back to the low."
Someone informed the Buddha... who summoned Nanda and said to him, "How is it,
Nanda, that you have no zest for the Brahma-life, that you cannot endure it,
that you will give up the training and return to the low?"
"Sir, when I left my home, a Shakyan girl, the fairest in the land, with hair
half combed, looked back at me and said this, 'May you soon come back again,
young master.'  I am always thinking of her, and hence I have no zest for the
Brahma-life, I cannot endure the Brahma-life, I will give up training and
return to the low."
Then the Exalted One took Nanda by the arm, and together they vanished from the
Jeta Grove and appeared among the devas of the Thirty-Three.  There, as many as
five hundred "dove-footed" nymphs had come to minister to Sakka, lord of the
devas.  The Exalted one said to Nanda, "Nanda, do you see those five hundred
dove-footed nymphs?"
"Yes, sir."
"What do you think, Nanda?  Which are the more lovely, more worth looking at,
more charming, the Shakyan girl, the loveliest in the land, or these five
hundred dove-footed nymphs?"
"O, sir, just as if she were a mutilated monkey with ears and nose cut off,
even so, sir, the Shakyan girl, the loveliest in the land, if set beside these
five hundred nymphs is not worth a fraction of them and cannot be compared with
them.  Why, these five hundred nymphs are far more lovely, far more worth
looking at, far more charming!"  Then the Exalted One, taking Nanda by the arm,
vanished from the devas of the Thirty-three and reappeared in Jeta Grove.
The monks heard the rumor, "They say that Nanda, brother of the Buddha, leads
the Brahma-life for the sake of the nymphs.  They say the Exalted One has
assured him of getting five hundred dove-footed nymphs." Thereupon the monks
who were comrades of Nanda called him "hireling" and "menial."...
Now the venerable Nanda, being thus worried, humiliated, and despised since he
was called a hireling and a menial by his comrades, living alone, remote,
energetic, ardent, making the self strong, in no time attained in this very
world, himself realizing it by full comprehension, that for which the clansman
rightly goes forth from home to homelessness, even that unsurpassed goal of the
Brahma-life, and so abided.  He realized, "Ended is birth, lived is the life,
done is what was to be done; there is no more of being here."  The venerable
Nanda had become one of the arahants....

At the end of that night the venerable Nanda came to the Exalted One, and on
coming to him saluted him and stood at one side and said, "Sir, as to the
Exalted One's standing surety for me for the getting five hundred dove-footed
nymphs, I release the Exalted One, sir, from that promise."
"I also, Nanda, grasping your thought with my own, have seen that this is so...
Since, Nanda, by not grasping, your heart is released from the cankers, I too
am released from my promise."

Udana 21-24: This is a good example of the Buddha's skill in means, to lead
Nanda by means of a small desire to realization of higher truth.  For another
example, see the Tevigga Sutta, p. 187.  On the use of seemingly evil beings to
realize a high purpose, see Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 6, p. 384.

"Suppose, for instance, a good physician, who is wise and perspicacious,
conversant with the medical art, and skillful in healing all sorts of diseases.
He has many sons, say ten, twenty, even up to a hundred.  Because of some
matter he goes abroad to a distant country. After his departure his sons drink
his other poisonous medicines, which send them into a delirium and they lie
rolling on the ground.  At this moment their father comes back to his home.  Of
the sons who drank the poison, some have lost their senses, others are
sensible....  The father, seeing his sons in such distress, in accordance with
his prescriptions, seeks for good herbs altogether perfect in color, scent, and
fine flavor, and then pounds, sifts, and mixes them and gives them to his sons
to take, saying thus, 'This excellent medicine with color, scent, and fine
flavor all perfect, do you take, and it will at once rid you of your distress
so that you will have no more suffering.'  Those amongst the sons who are
sensible, seeing this excellent medicine with color and scent both good, take
it immediately and are wholly delivered from their illness.  The others, who
have lost their senses, seeing their father come, though they are also
delighted, salute him, and ask him to heal their illness, yet when he offers
them the medicine, they are unwilling to take it.  Wherefore?  Because the
poison has entered deeply, they have lost their senses, and even in regard to
this medicine of excellent color and scent they say that it is not good.  The
father reflects thus, 'Alas for these sons, afflicted by this poison, and their
minds all unbalanced!  Though they are glad to see me and implore to be healed,
yet they are unwilling to take such excellent medicine as this.  Now I must
arrange an expedient plan so that they will take this medicine.' "Then he says
to them: 'Know, all of you, that I am now worn out with old age and that the
time of my death has now arrived.  This excellent medicine I now leave here.
You may take it and have no fear of not being better.'  After thus admonishing
them, he departs again for another country and sends a messenger back to inform
them, 'Your father is dead.' And now, when these sons hear that their father is
dead, their minds are greatly distressed and they thus reflect, 'If our father
were alive he would have pity on us, and we should be saved and preserved.  But
now he has left us and died in a distant country.'
"Deeming themselves orphans with no one to rely on, continuous grief brings
them to their senses; they recognize the color, scent, and excellent flavor of
the medicine, and thereupon take it, whence their poisoning is entirely
relieved.  Their father, hearing that the sons are recovered, seeks an
opportunity and returns, showing himself to them all.
"Good sons!  What is your opinion?  Are there any who could say that this good
physician had committed the sin of falsehood?"
"No, World-honored One!"
The Buddha then said: "I also am like the father.  It has been infinite
countless hundred thousand myriad billions of kalpas since I became Buddha.
But for the sake of all living beings, I say expediently, 'I must enter
Nirvana.'  There is none who can lawfully accuse me of falsehood."

Lotus Sutra 16: After having revealed the eternal life of the Buddha, the Lotus
Sutra explains the apparent demise of the historic Sakyamuni Buddha as an
expedient device.  Knowing that if the followers knew of the Buddha's eternal
life span, they might become lazy and not vigorously apply themselves to
attaining Nirvana, the Buddha uses his power of expedient devices to show his
death.  The sutra then illustrates this expedient device by the Parable of the
Good Physician, given here.  For another expedient device, see the Parable of
the Prodigal Son, Lotus Sutra 4, pp. 444f.; on Buddha as the Great Physician,
see Garland Sutra 37, p. 458.
