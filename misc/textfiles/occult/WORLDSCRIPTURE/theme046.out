                        Spiritual Error And The Occult
                                World Scripture

                        SPIRITUAL ERROR AND THE OCCULT

Within the major religions, there is a current of deep distrust for spirits and
their communications.  Since they are not comparable to Ultimate Reality,
spirits are not privy to the highest truth. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam
have a tradition that groups of the angels have fallen into error and
misunderstood the will of God.  Buddhism even regards the Creator god (the
Hindu god Brahma) as one of these subordinate deities, subordinate to the
Dhamma revealed by the Buddha, as shown in the text from the Digha Nikaya
reprinted here.

Spirits are often viewed as fallible, motivated by selfish ends, and liable to
mislead those who rely on them for guidance.  Furthermore, the spiritual world
is also populated by evil spirits, demons, fallen angels, and Satan--see
Demonic Powers, pp. 435-44, as well as intermediate spiritual beings including
the jinn, spirits of the dead, and various classes of ghosts. Therefore, a
person should 'test the spirits to see whether they are of God,' based on the
higher authority of revealed truth. Occult practices, such as seeking
information from mediums, witches, astrologers, and otherwise penetrating the
world of spirits, is condemned in many scriptures because it can lead people
astray through communication with spirits from the lower realms.  Attachment to
revelations from spirits can sometimes rival genuine faith in God.  Belief in
miracles can also lead astray.  Faith, purity, adherence to revealed truth, and
performance of good deeds are superior ways to insure fellowship with spiritual
beings of the highest levels.

Even in his servants he puts no trust,
and his angels he charges with error.

O Lord, how can a god or a demon know all the extent of your glory?  You alone
know what you are, by the light of your innermost nature.

                        2. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 10.14

They say, "The All-merciful has taken to Him a son."  Glory be to Him! Nay, but
they [whom they call 'sons'] are honored servants, that do not outstrip Him in
speech; they perform as He commands.  He knows what is before them and behind
them, and they do not intercede except for the man with whom He is
well-pleased.  They tremble in awe of Him.  If any of them says, "I am a god
apart from Him," such a one We recompense with hell, even as We recompense
those who do evil.

                           3. Islam.  Qur'an 21.26-29

God has taken his place in the divine council;
in the midst of the gods he holds judgment:
"How long will you judge unjustly
and show partiality to the wicked?
Give justice to the weak and the fatherless;
maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute.
Rescue the weak and the needy;
deliver them from the hand of the wicked."
They have neither knowledge nor understanding,
they walk about in darkness,
all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
I say, "You are gods,
sons of the Most High, all of you;
nevertheless you shall die like men,
and fall like any prince."
Arise, O God, judge the earth;
for to thee belong all the nations!

Say, It has been revealed to me that a company of the jinn gave ear.  Then they
said, "We have indeed heard a Qur'an wonderful, guiding to rectitude.  We
believe in it, and we will not associate with our Lord anyone.  He--exalted by
our Lord's majesty!--has not taken to Himself either consort or a son.

"The fool among us spoke against God outrage, and we had thought that men and
jinn would never speak against God a lie.  But there were certain men of
mankind who would take refuge with certain men of the jinn, and they increased
them in vileness, and they thought, even as you also thought, that God would
never raise up anyone.

"And we stretched towards heaven, but we found it filled with terrible guards
and meteors.  We would sit there on seats to hear; but any listening now finds
a meteor in wait for him.  And so we know not whether evil is intended for
those in the earth, or whether their Lord intends for them rectitude.

"And some of us are righteous, and some of us are otherwise; we are sects
differing.  Indeed, we thought that we should never be able to frustrate God in
the earth, neither be able to frustrate Him by flight. When we heard the
guidance, we believed in it; and whosoever believes in his Lord, he shall fear
never paltriness nor vileness.

"And some of us have surrendered, and some of us have deviated. Those who have
surrendered sought rectitude; but as for those who have deviated, they have
become firewood for hell."

Qur'an 21.26-29: This is directed against both polytheism and certain popular
forms of Christianity which take Jesus to be a separate god, the offspring of
God the Father.  Orthodox Christianity denies this: God the Son, second Person
of the Trinity, is not begotten, nor is he "a God apart from" the Father. Jesus
as the incarnation of the Son was always obedient to the Father's will. The
Trinity is One God; it should never be misunderstood as tri-theism.  Cf. Qur'an
5.75, p. 655; also Qur'an 4.116-17, p. 405, and 21.19-20, p. 84.

Once upon a time, Kevaddha, there occurred to a certain monk in this very
company of monks, a doubt on the following point: "Where now do these four
basic elements--extension, cohesion, heat, and motion--pass away, leaving no
trace behind?"  Then that monk worked himself up into such a state of ecstasy
that the way leading to the heaven of the gods became clear to his ecstatic
vision.

Then that monk went up to the realm of the Four Great Kings and asked the gods
there, "Where, my friends, do the four basic elements--extension, cohesion,
heat, and motion--pass away, leaving no trace behind?"  The gods of the heaven
of the Four Great Kings replied, "We do not know that.  But there are the Four
Great Kings, more powerful and glorious than we.  They will know."

Then that monk went up to the Four Great Kings and asked, "Where, my
friends..."  The Four Great Kings replied, "We do not know that.  But there are
the gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three... They will know."

Then that monk, putting the same question and getting the same reply, went to
Sakka, king of the heaven of the Thirty-three... up to the Yama gods... to the
Tusita gods... to the Nimmana-rati gods... to the Vasavatti gods... to the
retinue of the gods of the Heaven of God Almighty....

Finally the monk drew near to God Almighty [Brahma] and asked, "Where, my
friend, do the four basic elements--extension, cohesion, heat, and motion--pass
away, leaving no trace behind?"

And the greatest god replied, "I am the Great God, Almighty, the Supreme One,
the one who cannot be conquered by others, All-seeing, All-powerful, the Ruler,
the Creator, the Excellent, the Almighty, the One who has already practiced
Calm, the Father of all that are and all that are to be!"

The monk said, "I did not ask you as to whether you were indeed all that you
now say you are; but I ask you where do the four basic elements cease, leaving
no trace behind?"  Then the god gave the same reply.  And yet a third time the
monk put the same to question to god as before.

Then, Kevaddha, that greatest god took that monk by the arm and led him aside
and said, "These gods, the retinue of God Almighty, think me, friend, to be
such that there is nothing I cannot see, nothing I have not understood, nothing
I have not realized.  Therefore, I gave no answer to your question in their
presence.  I do not know the answer to your question.  Therefore, you have done
wrong, acted unskillfully, in that, going past the Buddha, you have undertaken
this long search for an answer to this question.  Go back now to the Exalted
One and accept his answer."

Then a blind and dumb demoniac was brought to [Jesus], and he healed him, so
that the dumb man spoke and saw.  And all the people were amazed, and said,
"Can this be the Son of David?"  But when the Pharisees heard it they said, "It
is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons."

eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you."

12.22-24: Jesus performed many miracles for the people.  Yet to the skeptical
leaders they proved nothing; the devil can also do miracles. John 6.26-27: The
common people also were more impressed by the miracle of multiplying the loaves
and fishes (see Mark 6.30-44, p. 638) than by Jesus himself and his message,
and followed him to see the show rather than to receive his wisdom. Miracles
are not conducive to lasting faith.

Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they

Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be uninformed.
You know that when you were heathen, you were led astray to dumb idols, however
you may have been moved.  Therefore I want you to understand that no one
speaking by the Spirit of God ever says "Jesus be cursed!" and no one can say
"Jesus is Lord!" except by the Holy Spirit.

Indeed, even the devas are jealous of a yogin, striving as he does to surpass
them by attaining Brahman.  They therefore try to lead him astray, in various

Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship Me, Arjuna,
even if they do not observe the usual forms.  I am the object of all worship,
its enjoyer and Lord.  But they know not My pure being, and because of this
they must be reborn.

Those who worship the gods will go to the realm of the gods; those who worship
their ancestors will be united with them after death.  Those who worship
phantoms will become phantoms; but My devotees will come to me.

To maintain the existence of a ghost,
Only brings about mischief;
To understand the non-existence of a ghost
Is the way of Buddha;
To know that ghost and Reality are one
Is the way to Liberation.
Knowing that the ghosts are all one's parents
Is the right understanding;
Realizing that the ghost itself is Self-mind
Is glory supreme.
