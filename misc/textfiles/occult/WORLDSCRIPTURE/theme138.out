                                 SERVING OTHERS
                                World Scripture

                                 SERVING OTHERS

The way of serving others is the topic of passages in this section. The purest
service is to help others and to seek the welfare of others without the
expectation of reward.  On the contrary, the way of selfishness brings only
disharmony and failure; the selfish person eventually will find himself alone
and without friends in his time of need.  In the Bhagavad Gita, and paralleled
by passages in the Tao Te Ching, the way of selfless service is described as
the fundamental principle by which God creates and sustains the universe;
whenever a person acts selflessly in the service of others, that act is born of
God.  Another group of passages connects service with true lordship.  While the
conventional rulers abuse their powers by seeking to be served by their
charges, the true leader is a servant to his people; as exemplified by Jesus,
who came "not to be served, but to serve."

Do nothing from selfishness or conceit, but in humility count others better
than yourselves.  Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also
to the interests of others.

                      11.Christianity.  Philippians 2.3-4

God's definition of goodness is total giving, total service, and absolute
unselfishness.  We are to live for others.  You live for others and others live
for you.  God lives for man and man lives for God.  The husband lives for his
wife and the wife lives for her husband.  This is goodness.  And here unity,
harmony, and prosperity abound.

Until now each and everyone throughout the world has been concerned only with
himself.  How pitiful it is!  You have no mind to help others, however hard you
may think it over.  Henceforth, replace your mind indefinitely!  I, Tsukihi,
request it from you all equally.  If you ask what kind of mind it is, it is the
mind to save single-heartedly all people of the world.  Henceforth, if only all
people of the world equally help each other on any and every matter, believe
that I, Tsukhihi, will accept your minds and will work any and every kind of
salvation!

Do not seek to benefit only yourself, but think of other people also.  If you
yourself have an abundance, do not say, "The others do not concern me, I need
not bother about them!"  If you were lucky in hunting, let others share it.
Moreover, show them the favorable spots where there are many sea lions which
can be easily slain.  Let others have their share occasionally.  If you want to
amass everything for yourself, other people will stay away from you and no one
will want to be with you.  If you should one day fall ill, no one will visit
you because, for your part, you did not formerly concern yourself about others.

Grant other people something also.  The Yamana do not like a person who acts
selfishly.

Heaven is eternal and Earth everlasting.
They can be eternal and everlasting because they do not exist for them- selves,
And for this reason can exist forever.
Therefore the sage places himself in the background,
but finds himself in the foreground.
He puts himself away, and yet he always remains.
Is it not because he has no personal interests?
This is the reason why his personal interests are fulfilled.

                           15.Taoism.  Tao Te Ching 7

At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created
together.  "Through selfless service, you will always be fruitful and find the
fulfillment of your desires": this is the promise of the Creator....

Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from the eternal, infinite Godhead. God is
present in every act of service.  All life turns on this law, O Arjuna.
Whoever violates it, indulging his senses for his own pleasure and ignoring the
needs of others, has wasted his life.  But those who realize the God within are
always satisfied.  Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no
longer seek happiness from the external world.  They have nothing to gain or
lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security.

What the outstanding person does, others will try to do.  The standards such
people set will be followed by the whole world.  There is nothing in the three
worlds for Me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue
to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own.  If I ever refrained from
continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example.  If I stopped
working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of
this world and these people.

Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to self- less
work one attains the supreme goal in life.  Do your work with the welfare of
others always in mind.  It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection;
others, too, have followed this path.

The ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare
of the world, without thought to themselves.  By abstaining from work you will
confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work
carefully, guided by compassion.

Guardianship is not to give an order but to give one's self.

      17.African Traditional Religions.  Nyika Proverb (Kenya and Tanzania)

Jesus said, "You know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them, and
their great men exercise authority over them.  It shall not be so among you;
but whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be
first among you must be your slave; even as the Son of man came not to be
served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."

                       18.Christianity.  Matthew 20.25-28

The sage does not accumulate for himself.
The more he uses for others, the more he has himself.
The more he gives to others, the more he possesses of his own.
The Way of Heaven is to benefit others and not to injure.
The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.

                          19.Taoism.  Tao Te Ching 81

If, for my own sake, I cause harm to others,
I shall be tormented in hellish realms;
But if for the sake of others I cause harm to myself,
I shall acquire all that is magnificent.

By holding myself in high esteem
I shall find myself in unpleasant realms, ugly and stupid;
But should this [attitude] be shifted to others
I shall acquire honors in a joyful realm.

If I employ others for my own purposes
I myself shall experience servitude,
But if I use myself for the sake of others
I shall experience only lordliness.
