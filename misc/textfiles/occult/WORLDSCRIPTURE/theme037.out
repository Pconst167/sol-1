                              The Lord Of Spirits
                                World Scripture

                              THE LORD OF SPIRITS

The natural world also includes the spiritual realm.  Often enough, benevolent
spiritual beings, angels, and devas are the objects of worship and
supplication; see Spiritual Benefactors, pp. 366-75.  Yet with deeper religious
insight, it has been revealed that the human being is, in reality, lord of
spirits.  Human beings who have received salvation, who are enlightened, or who
have achieved the highest goal of life, easily outshine the angels in glory and
surpass them in wisdom. Saints and sages, and even ordinary believers who have
strong faith, can command the heavenly hosts to assist them in a righteous
cause.  They can also rebuke and cast out evil spirits in the name of God.
Furthermore, according to the doctrine of reincarnation, even unreconstructed
human beings have more opportunity for spiritual advancement than do angels.
Only when incarnated as human beings may souls have an opportunity progress to
the point of their final liberation.

Do you not know that we are to judge angels?  How much more, matters pertaining
to this life!

Behold, your Lord said to the angels, "I will create a vicegerent on earth."
They said, "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed
blood?--while we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy name?"  He said,
"I know what you know not."

And He taught Adam the names of all things; then He placed them before the
angels, and said, "Tell Me the nature of these, if you are right."

They said, "Glory to Thee!  of knowledge we have none, save what Thou hast
taught us: in truth it is Thou who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."

He said, "O Adam, tell them their natures."  When he had told them, God said,
"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know
what you reveal, and what you conceal."

                            5. Islam.  Qur'an 2.30-33

God created all things with forms, but the invisible God does not have any
form.... However, without form, God could not have dominion over the world of
form.  Therefore, in the created world of material things, God created man, who
[was to be given divine] personality and spirit, to be the master.  God must
have dominion not only over all earthly things, but also over the infinite
spiritual world.  Archangels and all other spiritual beings are invisible
substantial beings [having form].  A certain central form is also necessary in
order to have dominion over the invisible substantial world. Then where was
that form available?  It was only through Adam that God could have such a form.
Accordingly, through Adam's form, God planned to have dominion over both the
spiritual world and the physical world, with Adam as the center.  That was the
purpose of creation.  God had to have a substantial relationship with the
substantial being, Adam, in order to have dominion over all things.

When Moses ascended on high, the ministering angels spoke before the Holy One,
blessed be He, "Sovereign of the Universe!  What business has one born of woman
among us?"  "He has come to receive the Torah," He answered them.  They
replied, "That secret treasure, which has been hidden by You for nine hundred
and seventy-four generations before the world was created, You desire to give
to flesh and blood!  'What is man, that Thou art mindful of him, And the son of
man, that thou visitest him?  O Lord our God, How excellent is thy name in all
the earth!  Who hast set thy glory [the Torah] upon the heavens!'" (Psalm 8.5,
2).

"Reply to them," said the Holy One to Moses....

Moses then spoke before Him, "Sovereign of the Universe!  The Torah which You
give me, what is written in it?"  "I am the Lord your God, which brought you
out of the Land of Egypt" (Exodus 20.2).  He said to the angels, "Did you go
down to Egypt; were you enslaved to Pharaoh; why then should the Torah be
yours?  Again, what is written in it?  'You shall have no other gods' (Exodus
20.3); do you dwell among peoples that engage in idol worship?  Again, what is
written in it?  'Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy' (Exodus 20.8); do
you perform work, that you need to rest?...  Again, what is written in it? 'You
shall not murder.  You shall not commit adultery.  You shall not steal' (Exodus
20.13-15); is there any jealousy among you; is the evil Tempter among you?"
Straightaway the angels conceded to the Holy One, blessed be He, for it is
said, "O Lord our Lord, How excellent is Thy name in all the earth," whereas
"Who hast set Thy glory upon the heavens" is not written (Psalm 8.10).

Myung Moon, 9-30-79, p. 307.  This original blessing of dominion, and God's
purpose in creating men to dwell on earth, was spoiled by the Fall.  Fallen
mankind has come under the false dominion of the archangel Satan.  And God does
not dwell in the personality of fallen man.  Cf. 10-20-73, p. 467; Divine
Principle I.1.2.3.4, p. 253.  Shabbat 88b-89a: This argument between God and
the angels, with Moses acting as God's spokesman, is a midrash on Psalm 8 (p.
310), which proclaims the dominion of humankind.  The angels quote verse 2 of
the psalm to argue that God's glory belongs in the heavens, but after Moses'
arguments, they concede that the psalm concludes in verse 10 with God's name
found only in the earth.  The point seems to be responsibility, which humans
alone possess.  Cf. Qur'an 33.72, p. 311.

Thus I have heard, on a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near
Uruvela, on the bank of the river Neranjara, at the root of the mucalinda tree,
having just won the highest wisdom.  Now on that occasion the Exalted One was
seated for seven days in one posture and experienced the bliss of release.
Then arose a great storm of rain out of due season, and for seven days there
was rainy weather, cold winds, and overcast skies.  So Mucalinda, King of the
snakes, coming forth from his haunt, encircled the body of the Exalted One
seven times with his coils and stood rearing his great hood above the Exalted
One's head, thinking, "Let not heat or cold or the touch of flies, mosquitoes,
wind, or creeping things annoy the Exalted One."

Now after the lapse of those seven days the Exalted One roused himself from
that concentration of mind.  Then Mucalinda, King of the snakes, seeing that
the sky was clear and free of clouds, unwrapped his folds from the Exalted
One's body, and, withdrawing his own form and creating the form of a youth,
stood before the Exalted One, holding up his clasped hands and doing reverence
to him.

Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and
over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you. Nevertheless, do
not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your
names are written in heaven.

"In the ecstasy of Munihood
we have ascended on the wind,

are what you mortals ever see."

The Muni flies through mid-air

spiritual forces.  His homage to the Buddha expresses the Buddha's lordship
over the angelic world.  The scene is well-known in Buddhist iconography.

Blessed is human birth; even the dwellers in heaven desire this birth: for true
wisdom and pure love may be attained only by man.

                     11. Hinduism.  Srimad Bhagavatam 11.13

The universe is peopled by manifold creatures who are, in this round of
rebirth, born in different families and castes for having done various actions.

Sometimes they go to the world of the gods, sometimes to the hells, sometimes
they become demons in accordance with their actions. Sometimes they become
soldiers, or outcastes and untouchables, or worms or moths....

Thus, living beings of sinful actions, who are born again and again in
ever-recurring births, are not disgusted with the round of rebirth, but they
are like warriors, never tired of the battle of life. Bewildered through the
influence of their actions, distressed and suffering pains, they undergo misery
in non-human births.

But by the cessation of karma, perchance, living beings will reach in due time
a pure state and be born as men.
