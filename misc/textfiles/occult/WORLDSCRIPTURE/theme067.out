
UNIVERSAL SALVATION

       The compassion and grace of God know no bounds.  In some passages
from scripture, the extent of God's saving work is predicted eventually to
embrace all humankind.  Thus does the Divine Parent's heart yearn for all
His children.  In Buddhist terms, the essential purpose of absolute Truth
is to liberate all sentient beings, and Mahayana Buddhist scriptures
express the universality of grace in the vow of the Buddha Amitabha.  His
vow is similar to the Bodhisattva Vow to save all beings, and in popular
Buddhism the great Bodhisattvas who attend the Buddha are revered as
manifesting gracious aspects of Ultimate Reality.

       Universal salvation is compatible with the belief that there is
only one valid and true religion.  Salvation may come to all people
through one central point: thus in Abraham 'shall all the families of the
earth be blessed' (Genesis 12.3).  For those who believe in one religion
as the only way, the divine mandate to save all humankind is a powerful
impetus to missionary activity.

       We conclude with several passages which offer salvation to souls in
hell. If salvation is to be available universally, to every soul who has
ever lived regardless of his or her earthly life, the doctrine may appear
at odds with beliefs about hell and the Last Judgment.  If God is most
essentially just, how can the wicked receive salvation?  On the other
hand, if God is most essentially gracious and compassionate, how can He
permit any creature to suffer in hell eternally?  Compassion and justice
must go together.  Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism reconcile these aspects
of Ultimate Reality by regarding all states of hell as purgatories,
designed to mete out punishments for a limited period of time, that evil
karma might be burned up and the soul have a future opportunity to find
the Path.  Christian and Islamic theologians dispute this question among
themselves--some upholding an eternal hell, others looking to universal
salvation.  The Latter-day Saints practice baptism for the dead, thereby
emptying hell of its dead through the efforts of the living.

God it is who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the Religion of
Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the
idolators may be averse.

Turn to me and be saved,
       all the ends of the earth!
    for I am God, and there is no other.
By myself I have sworn,
    from my mouth has gone forth in righteousness
       an irrevocable decree:
"To me every knee shall bow,
       every tongue shall swear."

Miqdad reported that he heard God's messenger say, "There will not remain
on the face of the earth a mud-brick house or a camel's hair tent which
God will not cause the confession of Islam to enter, bringing both mighty
honor and abject abasement.  God will either honor the occupants and put
them among its adherents, or will humiliate them and they will be subject
to it."  Miqdad said, "God will then receive complete obedience."

I testify that Thou art the Lord of all creation, and the Educator of all
beings, visible and invisible.  I bear witness that Thy power hath
encompassed the entire universe, and that the hosts of the earth can never
dismay Thee, nor can the dominion of all peoples and nations deter Thee
from executing Thy purpose.  I confess that Thou hast no desire except the
regeneration of the whole world, and the establishment of the unity of its
peoples, and the salvation of all them that dwell therein.

Behold my servant, whom I uphold,
       my chosen, in whom my soul delights;
I have put my Spirit upon him,
       he will bring forth justice to the nations.
He will not cry or lift up his voice,
       or make it heard in the street;

a bruised reed he will not break,
       and a dimly burning wick he will not quench;
       he will faithfully bring forth justice.
He will not fail or be discouraged
       till he has established justice in the earth;
       and the coastlands wait for his law.

I establish the Vows unexcelled,
And reach the highest path, Bodhi.
Were these Vows unfulfilled,
I would never attain Enlightenment.

I will be the great provider
Throughout innumerable ages.
Should I fail to save all in need,
I would never attain Enlightenment.

Upon my attaining Enlightenment,
If my Name were not heard anywhere
In the ten quarters of the universe,
I would never attain Enlightenment.

Practicing the Holy Way--selflessness,
Depth in right reflection and pure wisdom,
Aspiring toward the highest path,
I will be the teacher of devas and men.

My wondrous power by its great light
Brightens countless lands throughout,
Removes the darkness of the three defilements
And delivers all from suffering and pain.

Those who are wretched shall be in the Fire... they will dwell therein for
all the time that the heavens and the earth endure, except as your Lord
wills; for your Lord is the sure Accomplisher of what He plans.

                         Islam.  Qur'an 11.106-07


For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the
unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the
flesh but made alive in the spirit; in which he went and preached to the
spirits in prison, who formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited
in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark.

                  Christianity.  Bible, 1 Peter 3.18-20


It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten
with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between
the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other--and behold what
is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead.  For we without them
cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect.
Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the
gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of
the fullness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in,
that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of
dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place.

Isaiah 42.1-4: This 'servant song' is understood differently by Jews and
Christians.  Jews interpret the servant to be Israel, and view the passage
as a statement of Israel's vocation to be a light to the world. Christians
understand the fuller meaning of the servant as realized in Christ.
Larger Sukhavativyuha Sutra 9.1-5: This is one of the chief hymns of the
Pure Land school.  One should not interpret this passage as speaking of
God's love in the western sense of the divine Being's love for his
creatures.  Rather, the ideal of the bodhisattva illustrates the Mahayana
Buddhist principle that Ultimate Reality is itself all-embracing,
inclusive of every living being and of the nature of compassion.  One who
truly understands this principle cannot help but feel suffering as long as
there is even one individual who suffers, for that unfortunate individual
is one's very self.  This is the essence of the Bodhisattva Vow; see
Sikshasamuccaya 280-81, pp. 979f., and Garland Sutra 23, p. 980; see also
the Eighteenth Vow of Buddha Amitabha, Larger Sukhavativyuha Sutra 8.18,
p. 639.  Qur'an 11.106-07: Based on this verse, some Muslim theologians
have deduced that the penalties in hell are not eternal, for 'the time
that the heavens and the earth endure' has a limit; in the end they are to
be dissolved and renewed.  1 Peter 3.18-20: This passage is usually
interpreted to mean that Jesus preached to the spirits in hell. Or, if the
doctrine of eternal hell is to be upheld, then the 'prison' may be
interpreted as an intermediate state of purgatory.  Compare Markandeya
Purana 13-15, p. 981.  Doctrine and Covenants 128.18: The baptism for the
dead is an important rite of the Latter-day Saints, bringing salvation to
those who have passed away in ignorance--'those who have died in the
gospel' are Christians ignorant of the new dispensation--and bringing
wholeness and complete salvation to the cosmos.  Notice the Bible
references to Malachi 4.6 and Hebrews 11.39-40.  Cf. Doctrine and
Covenants 76.54-93, p. 322.
