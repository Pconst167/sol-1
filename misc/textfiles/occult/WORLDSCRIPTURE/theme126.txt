
SELF-DENIAL AND NO-SELF


       Self-denial is necessary to overcome the hindrances of egoism,
pride, and selfish desires which obscure the true nature within.   The
person who is always concerned with himself or herself, is trapped in
"the ego-cage of 'I', 'me' and 'mine.'"  Consequently, he can neither
realize his own true self nor relate to Ultimate Reality.  From a Hindu
perspective, denying "I," "me," and "mine" is in fact a way to find the
true "I" that is transcendent and one with Reality.  In the Western per-
spective it is a way to recover the true self, which is loving and comp-
assionate, having been created in the image of God.  Both perspectives
affirm the paradox that "he who loves his life loses it, and he who hates
his life will keep it."  For more on this paradox, see Reversal and
Restoration, pp. 544-50.

       Buddhism also teaches that the path to the religious goal requires
one to deny the self and all egoistic grasping.  But it goes further,
grounding the practice of self-denial on the ontological statement that
any form of a self is unreal.  Buddhism is most sensitive to the insight
that self-denial, when done for the purpose of seeking unity with an Abso-
lute Self or God, can become subtly perverted into a form of pride and
self-affirmation.  Total self-denial should therefore dispense even with
the goal of a transcendent Self.  There is no self, either on earth or in
heaven; all forms are transient, subject to birth and death.  A number of
texts explaining this doctrine of No-self (anatta) are collected here:
more may be found under Formless, Emptiness, Mystery, pp. 85-92 and Orig-
inal Mind, No-mind, pp. 217-23.


He who has no thought of "I" and "mine" whatever towards his mind and
body, he who grieves not for that which he has not, he is, indeed, called
a bhikkhu.

They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away
from the ego-cage of "I," "me," and "mine" to be united with the Lord.
Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality.

If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
and follow me.  For whoever would save his life will lose it; and whoever
loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it.

Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth
and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.  He who
loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep
it for eternal life.

O Son of Man!  If you love Me, turn away from yourself; and if you seek My
pleasure, regard not your own; that you may die in Me and I may eternally
live in you.

Where egoism exists, Thou art not experienced,
Where Thou art, is not egoism.

Yen Yan asked about perfect virtue.  The Master said, "To subdue one's
self and return to propriety is perfect virtue.  If a man can for one day
subdue himself and return to propriety, all under heaven will ascribe per-

The pursuit of learning is to increase day after day.
The pursuit of Tao is to decrease day after day.
It is to decrease and further decrease until one reaches the point of
     taking no action.
No action is undertaken, and yet nothing is left undone.

If you do not deny yourself completely, restoration through indemnity is
impossible.  Indemnity conditions can be realized only by completely deny-
ing yourself.  The standard of absolute denial should be established tow-
ard the individual, the family, the race, the world, the cosmos, and God.

In the evening do not expect [to live till] morning, and in the morning do

Seek not for life on earth or in heaven.  Thirst for life is delusion.

You, who sit on the top of a hundred-foot pole, although you have entered
the Way you are not yet genuine.  Proceed on from the top of the pole, and
you will show your whole body in the ten directions.

Mumon's Comment: If you go on further and turn your body about, no place
is left where you are not the master.  But even so, tell me, how will you
go on further from the top of a hundred-foot pole? Eh?

"All states are without self."  When one sees this in wisdom, then he be-
comes dispassionate towards the painful.  This is the path to purity.

                   Buddhism.  Dhammapada 277-79


       "The body, brethren, is not the self.  If body were the self, this
body would not be subject to sickness, and one could say of body, 'Let my
body be thus; let my body not be thus.'  But inasmuch as body is not the
self, that is why body is subject to sickness, and one cannot say of body,
'Let my body be thus; let my body not be thus.'

       "Feeling is not the self.  If feeling were the self, then feeling
would not be subject to sickness, and one could say of feeling, 'Let my
feeling be thus; let my feeling not be thus.'

       "Likewise perception... the [volitional] activities... and consc-
iousness are not the self.  If consciousness were the self, then con-
sciousness would not be subject to sickness, and one could say of
consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be
thus'; but inasmuch as consciousness is not the self, that is why
consciousness is subject to sickness, and that is why one cannot say of
consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus; let my consciousness not be
thus.'

       "Now what do you think, brethren, is body permanent or impermanent?"
       "Impermanent, Lord."
       "And is the impermanent painful or pleasant?"
       "Painful, Lord."
       "Then what is impermanent, painful, and unstable by nature, is it
          fitting to consider as, 'this is mine, this am I, this is my
          self'?"
       "Surely not, Lord."

       "So also is it with feeling, perception, the activities, and consc-
iousness.  Therefore, brethren, every body whatever, be it past, future,
or present, be it inward or outward, gross or subtle, lowly or eminent,
far or near--every body should be thus regarded, as it really is, by right
insight--'this is not mine; this am not I; this is not my self.'

       "Every feeling whatever, every perception whatever, all activities
whatsoever, every consciousness whatever [must likewise be so regarded].

       "Thus perceiving, brethren, the well-taught noble disciple feels
disgust for body, feels disgust for feeling, for perception, for the acti-
vities, for consciousness.  Feeling disgust he is repelled; being repell-
ed, he is freed; knowledge arises that in the freed is emancipation; so he
knows, 'destroyed is rebirth; lived is the religious life; done is my
task; for life in these conditions there is no hereafter.'"

Mumonkan 33: Implicit in this koan is the instruction to deny not only the
self but also any object of attainment--even the Buddha himself; see Sutta
Nipata 1072-76, p. 532; 919-920, p. 553; Sutra of Hui Neng 2, p. 90.  The
third of the Four Noble Truths speaks of the eradication of desire or
striving, even striving after enlightenment.  Compare Mumonkan 30, p. 116,
which asserts the seeming opposite.  Dhammapada 277-79: The self is right-
ly denied because it truly does not exist; this is the Buddhist teaching
on no-self (anatta).  See Sutta Nipata 1072-76, p. 532; 919-920, p. 553.
Samyutta Nikaya iii.68: Matter (the body), sensation (feelings), cognition
(perception), volition (the activities), and the consciousness which de-
pends upon them are called the five aggregates (skandhas).  The Buddha
taught that these aggregates, which are commonly thought to constitute the
self, are not the self.  They are impermanent and unreal, and so is the
self which is thought to consist of them.  Cf. Majjhima Nikaya i.142-45,
p. 929; Diamond Sutra 14, p. 888; Sutta Nipata 1072-76, p. 532.
