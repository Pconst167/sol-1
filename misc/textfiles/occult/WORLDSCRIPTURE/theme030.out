                                    Equality
                                World Scripture

                                    EQUALITY

The equality of all persons, male and female, rich and poor, of any race,
class, or caste, is proclaimed in the scriptures of all faiths.  This is true
despite the conventions of many cultures that discriminate between people on
the basis of caste, or class, or race, or sex.  Regrettably, such
discrimination is also on occasion supported by certain conventional
interpretations of passages from sacred texts.  Yet with the development of a
more refined religious consciousness, all forms of discrimination are being
overcome, and interpretations of religious texts which have traditionally
undergirded discriminatory attitudes and practices are being shown to be
erroneous.

The essential equality of all people is supported by the doctrines of the
monotheistic faiths, that God is the parent of all humanity and that all human
beings are descended from one pair of original ancestors, Adam and Eve.  In
Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, and Confucianism, this equality is grounded in the
fact that Enlightenment, unity with the Absolute, or the realization of
Goodness is available to all universally.  Distinctions among people,
therefore, should be based only on their conduct, morality, and level of
(spiritual) education, and attainment.

The passages below are grouped under the following themes: (1) equality is
grounded in the One Absolute; (2) a person's value is determined by his
education and attainments, not by birth; and (3) there are no distinctions of
class or caste, (4) nationality, (5) race, or (6) sex.  Further relevant
passages on the equality of people of different creeds may be found in the
Prologue, pp. 57-69.

O mankind!  We created you from a single pair of a male and a female and made
you into nations and tribes, that you might know each other [not that you might

he who is the most righteous.

All the people of the whole world are equally brothers and sisters. There is no
one who is an utter stranger.  There is no one who has known the truth of this
origin.  It is the very cause of the regret of Tsukihi (God).  The souls of all
people are equal, whether they live on the high mountains or at the bottoms of
the valleys.

Not by matted hair, nor by family, nor by birth does one become a brahmin. But
in whom there exist both truth and righteousness, pure is he, a brahmin is he.

I do not call him a brahmin merely because he is born of a brahmin womb or
sprung from a brahmin mother.  Being with impediments, he should address others
as "sir."  But he who is free from impediments, free from clinging--him I call
a brahmin.

Ofudesaki XIII.43-45: All mankind--the wealthy (on high mountains) and the poor
(in the valleys)--emanated from one point, 'this origin:' their common ancestor
was formed by God the Parent at the shrine at Tenri, navel of the
world--compare the Shinto cosmogony in the Kojiki 4-6, 178. There they will
finally return to their common root.  On God's regret, see Ofudesaki
XVII.65-70, p. 460.  Dhammapada 393, 396: The Buddha gave new, spiritual
definitions to Hindu racial and caste terms like Aryian and Brahmin.  An Aryian
is not a member of a light-skinned race, but one who follows the Aryian
Eightfold Path.  A Brahmin is not a member of a privileged caste, but one who
attains the stage of arahant.  Cf. Dhammapada 402-422, pp. 231f.

Is anyone in this world born through the ear?

Asa, M.1 and Sri-ki-Var Mahalla, M.1: At the Sikh communal meal or pangat, all
eat together while sitting in a single line, without distinction of caste,
rank, or wealth.  Kings and beggars, brahmins and garbagemen sit together as
equals, thus destroying caste consciousness; see Kanara, M.5, p. 285.  For
among caste-conscious Hindus, it is taboo for a Brahmin to eat at the same
table with an untouchable.  Vacana 589: See Vacana 716, p. 804.  The discussion
of conception and birth is to mock the Vedic tradition in Rig Veda 10.90.11-12,
p. 275, that brahmins were set apart at the Creation by being born through the
mouth of the cosmic person.  Cf. Itivuttaka 101, p. 575.

Philemon 10-17: Paul, while in prison, had converted Onesimus, a runaway slave,
to Christianity.  Paul finally sends him back to his master, Philemon, with a
letter appealing that he treat Onesimus not as a runaway slave but as a brother
in Christ.  According to Roman law the master had absolute authority over his
slaves, but Paul is appealing to a higher law.  Although Paul writes quite
tactfully in this letter, eventually the principle set up in this passage would
operate to abolish slavery altogether.  Cf. 1 Corinthians 7.20-24, p. 710.
Amos 9.7: The prophet Amos warns Israel not to be overly proud of its position
as God's chosen people.  God has been working to save even Israel's worst
enemies, the Philistines and the Syrians; cf. Matthew 5.45, p. 140; Megilla
10b, p. 514.

Shariputra, "Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your
female state, by nature filthy and an unfit vessel?"

Goddess, "Although I have sought my 'female state' for these twelve years, I
have not yet found it.  Reverend Shariputra, if a magician were to incarnate a
woman by magic, would you ask her, 'What prevents you from transforming
yourself out of your female state?'"

Shariputra, "No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to
transform?"

"Just so, Reverend Shariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you
think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from
transforming herself out of her female state?" Thereupon, the goddess employed
her magical power to cause the elder Shariputra to appear in her form and to
cause herself to appear in his form.  Then the goddess, transformed into
Shariputra, said to Shariputra, transformed into a goddess, "Reverend
Shariputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female
state?"

And Shariputra, transformed into a goddess, replied, "I no longer appear in the
form of a male!  My body has changed into the body of a woman!  I do not know
what to transform!"

The goddess continued, "If the elder could again change out of the female
state, then all women could also change out of their female states.  All women
appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the
form of a woman.  While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form
of women.  With this in mind, the Buddha said, 'In all things, there is neither
male nor female.'"

The sister Soma... when she was returning from her alms-round, after her meal,
entered Dark Wood for noonday rest, and plunging into its depths sat down under
a certain tree.  Then Mara the evil one, desirous of arousing fear, wavering
and dread in her, desirous of making her desist from concentrated thought, went
up to her and addressed her in verse,

That opportunity [for arahantship] the sages may
attain is hard to win.  But with her two-finger wit
that may no woman ever hope to achieve.

Then Soma thought, "Who now is this, human or non-human, that speaks verse?
Surely it is Mara the Evil One who speaks verse, desirous of arousing in me
fear, wavering and dread...."  The sister replied in verses:

To one for whom the question arises:
Am I a woman [in these matters], or
am I a man, or what not am I then?
To such a one is Mara fit to talk.

Then Mara the Evil One thought, "Sister Soma recognizes me!" and sad and
sorrowful he vanished.

Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 7: The point of this story is not that in this
world there should be equality among the sexes.  Rather, Buddhism teaches that
sexual differentiation belongs only to the phenomenal sphere, which is
transient and illusory.  In Reality, beyond all appearances, sexuality is
transcended.  Compare Matthew 22.30, p. 353. A similar story can be found in
chapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra, where the daughter of a dragon king transforms
herself into the form of a man to attain Buddhahood, thereby showing Shariputra
that he should not regard a woman to be a 'filthy vessel' incapable of
receiving the Law.  And in the Surangama Sutra, the bodhisattva Dridamati asks
Gopaka-deva what kind of merit enables a woman to transform her female body
into a male body, and the god replies that the problem is not important for the
aspirant of the Mahayana as the discrimination does not exist in the mind of an
enlightened being. What should the woman's nature signify when consciousness is
tense and firmly set, when knowledge rolls ever on, when she by insight rightly
comprehends the Dhamma? Samyutta Nikaya i.128: For an exemplary female disciple
of Jesus, see Mark 14.3-9, p. 765.
