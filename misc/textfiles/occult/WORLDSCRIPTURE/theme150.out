THE PILLARS OF SOCIETY

The pillars of a nation are those exceptional people who provide its spiritual
and moral anchor and bestow its vision and purpose. These are not ordinarily
its politicians or rulers. Rather, they are the righteous people, saints, and
teachers, ordinary people of courage, principle and conscience, people who
realize the truth within themselves and are willing to take responsibility for
their community. Rarely are they recognized and honored in their lifetime;
sometimes they are tolerated as goads and troublemakers and only appreciated
after their death; most often they are unsung, anonymous people who, because
they are sincere and conscientious, suffer in a world of vanities. These are
people who have a deep realization of truth and are called to serve as
society's internal leaders. Their example and message has a transforming effect
on those who approach them with humility and deference. It is often of far
greater value than the policies and speeches of the governing authorities.

There are [always] thirty righteous men among the nations, by whose virtue the
nations of the world continue to exist.

and, following righteous practices, are never contaminated by desire,
covetousness, and wrath.

Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to
Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.

When the righteous man is in the town, he is its luster, its majesty, and its
glory. When he leaves it, its luster, its majesty, and its glory depart.

4. Judaism. Midrash, Genesis Rabbah 68.6

The perfume of flowers blows not against the wind, nor does the fragrance of
sandalwood, tagara and jasmine, but the fragrance of the virtuous blows against
the wind; the virtuous man pervades every direction.

one who shall revive for it its faith.

7. Islam. Hadith of Abu Dawud 1

The myriad objects owe their existence to the mutual stimulation subsisting
between Heaven and earth. Similarly, the holy sage stimulates men's hearts and
the whole world is thenceforth at peace.

8. Confucianism. I Ching 31: Attraction

Take responsibility for the most difficult problem in your nation. Take
responsibility for the most difficult problem of your church. Take
responsibility for the most difficult problem of the world.

9. Unification Church. Sun Myung Moon, 5-1-81

The bodhisattvas, guardians of the city of Dharma, uphold the true doctrine,
and their great teachings resound like the lion's roar throughout the ten
directions. Without having to be asked, they are the natural spiritual
benefactors of all living beings.

10. Buddhism. Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 1

In the Book of Songs it is said,
He makes no show of his moral worth, Yet all the princes follow in his steps.

can help to bring peace and order in the world.

My saints are under my protection, and only I know them.

made with noise and show are of the least importance."

14. Confucianism. Doctrine of the Mean 33

He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised
reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will
faithfully bring forth justice.

15. Judaism and Christianity. Isaiah 42.2-3

A stranger colonial administrator, however vigilant, Cannot perceive a locality
as clearly as an indigene [village elder]. It is the attitude of the indigine
to the affairs of his locality Which determines that of the stranger to the
same. Malofin, the entire town is in your hand. "Situations do not get spoiled
when elders are around," This is the age-old wise saying.

16. African Traditional Religions. Yoruba Song (Nigeria)

Rabbi Assi and Rabbi Ammi, on an educational inspection tour, came to a town
and asked for its guardians. The councilmen appeared, but the rabbis said,
"These are not guardians, but wreckers of a town! The guardians are the
teachers of the young, and instructors of the old, as is written: 'Except the
Lord keep the city, the watchman wakes but in vain' [Psalm 127.1]."

17. Judaism. Midrash, Lamentations Rabbah, Proem 2

They say, "Why is not this Qur'an sent down to some leading man in either of
the two chief cities?" Is it they who would portion out the Mercy of the Lord?
It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in the life of this
world: and We raise some of them above others in ranks, so that some may
command work from others. But the Mercy of the Lord is better than the wealth
which they amass.
