                                Goodness and Love
                                World Scripture

                               GOODNESS AND LOVE

The following two sections bring together passages describing some personal
attributes of Ultimate Reality.  This section has passages from scripture
discussing God's attributes of goodness and love.  Most of them describe God as
good, loving, beautiful, truthful, compassionate, and faithful in personal
terms.  Theologians have argued that the personality of God is the highest
aspect of God's nature, just as the faculties of intellect, emotion, and will
make human beings the highest achievement of the created order.  The opening
passages depict goodness, compassion, and love as the primary attributes of
Ultimate Reality.  We follow with passages which describe God's gracious
provision to human beings, where God's goodness is especially manifest in His
help for the poor and downtrodden.

In addition, there are passages which describe the absolute goodness of
Ultimate Reality in impersonal terms.  Ultimate Reality is above the fetters of
human cravings and above relative human judgments of good and evil.  This
goodness is universal and all-embracing.  Common metaphors liken this goodness
to the beneficial influences of the rain and the sun to promote growth and
abundance to all nature.

The passages in this section focus on the nature of Ultimate Reality itself as
loving, merciful, and good.  Related themes on various manifestations of divine
love and mercy may be found throughout the anthology: see Grace, pp. 505-12,
Help and Deliverance, pp. 557-68; and themes on human love as a response to
divine love in True Love, pp. 236-41, Husband and Wife, pp. 251-64, Devotion
and Praise, p. 760-66, and Loving Kindness, pp. 967-73.

is eternal, blissful, and the nature of pure delight, is called Nirvana.

            8. Jainism.  Samantabadhra, Ratnakarandasravakacara 131

This is Peace, this is the excellent, namely the calm of all the impulses, the

attributes mentioned in the Fatihah, Qur'an 1, p. 53.  Ashanti Proverb: cf.
Kikuya Prayer, p. 779.  Qur'an 42.19: Cf. Qur'an 2.268-69, p. 508.  Tao Te
Ching 37: Wu wei or Non-action is the Taoist concept comparable to love in
Christianity or mercy in Buddhism.  It is the essence of Ultimate Reality's way
of being and relating to creatures.  It is impartial, and wholly beneficent,
whereas its opposite, action, is partial and leads to division, inequality, and
strife.  Cf. Tao Te Ching 34, p. 141. Ratnkarandasravakacara 31 and Anguttara
Nikaya v.322: Nirvana is the Ultimate Good because it is the complete end of
all the impulses and passions that produce evil.

Then did I recognize Thee in mind,
to be the first and the last, O Lord,
Father of good thought,
when I apprehended Thee in my eye,
True creator of Right,
the Lord over the actions of life!

                    11. Zoroastrianism.  Avesta, Yasna 31.8

The Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds--
Who created me, and it is He who guides me;
Who gives me food and drink,
And when I am ill, it is He who cures me;
Who will cause me to die, and then to live again;
And Who, I hope, will forgive me my faults on the Day of Judgment.

                          13. Islam.  Qur'an 26.77-82

The Dwelling of the Tathagata is the great compassionate heart within all the
living.  The Robe of the Tathagata is the gentle and forbearing heart. The Seat
of the Tathagata is the "spirituality of all existence."

I have no corporeal existence,
but Universal Benevolence is my divine body.
I have no physical power,
but Uprightness is my strength.
I have no religious clairvoyance beyond what is bestowed by Wisdom,
I have no power of miracle other than the attainment of quiet happiness,
I have no tact except the exercise of gentleness.

Lotus Sutra 10:  This is another way of asserting the one ultimate which is
all-embracing.  The twin pillars of Mahayana Buddhism are wisdom (prajna) and
compassion (karuna).  At the level of feeling or experience, compassion is that
which embraces all things.  Wisdom teaches the oneness and inter-connectedness
of all existence; hence it, too, evokes compassion. Hadith of Muslim: Cf.
Atharva Veda 10.8.31, p. 76.

All that is evil, Savitri, God, send away from us,
and send us what is good.
Purified, for spiritual might, under God Savitri's impulsion,
we think of all beautiful things.
The universal God, Lord of goodness, we with hymns elect today,
Savitri, whose power lies in truth.

                        17. Hinduism.  Rig Veda 5.82.5-7

Love is the firstborn, loftier than the gods, the Fathers and men.
You, O Love, are the eldest of all, altogether mighty.
To you we pay homage!

Greater than the breadth of earth and heaven, or of waters and Fire,
You, O Love, are the eldest of all, altogether mighty.
To you we pay homage!

In many a form of goodness, O Love, you show your face.
Grant that these forms may penetrate within our hearts.
Send elsewhere all malice!

                    18. Hinduism.  Atharva Veda 9.2.19-20, 25

One attempting to express God's creation and to contemplate it
Shall find it beyond counting and innumerable.
The Bull of Dharma is born of compassion;
Content of mind holds creation together.
Whoever understands this is enlightened;
How great is the load under which this Bull stands!

Rig Veda 5.28.5-7:  God is recognized to be the source of goodness, truth, and
beauty.  Atharva Veda 9.2.19-20,25: Kama, translated 'Love,' is often
translated Desire.  Specifically, it is desire which seeks fulfillment in love,
comparable to the Western concept of eros.  According to the Rig Veda 10.129,
p. 130, this love is the creative and generative power for all life. Kama
appears in myth as the enemy of asceticism and spiritual attainment, yet he
cannot be destroyed; all life depends upon the working of desire; see Skanda
Purana 1.1.21.82-99, pp. 421f.  Adi Granth, Japuji 16: The underlying source of
the universe within its laws, the 'Bull of Dharma,' is the divine mind,
specifically divine compassion.  The world's pain and suffering is a heavy
burden indeed: cf. pp. 457-62.

O good man! One who acts good is the "true thinking."
The true thinking is compassion.
Compassion is the Tathagata.

O good man!  Compassion is the bodhi path;
The bodhi path is the Tathagata.
The Tathagata is compassion.

O good man!  Compassion is Great Brahma.
Great Brahma is compassion.
Compassion is the Tathagata.

O good man!  Compassion acts as parent to all beings.
The parent is compassion.
Know that compassion is the Tathagata.

O good man!  Compassion is the Buddha Nature of all beings.
Such a Buddha Nature is long overshadowed by illusion.
That is why beings cannot see.
The Buddha Nature is Compassion.
Compassion is the Tathagata.

It is the Way of Heaven to show no favoritism. It is for ever on the side of
the good man.

What is God?  He/she is an existence that absolutely lives for others.

                23. Unification Church.  Sun Myung Moon, 4-16-88

For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty
and the terrible God, who is not partial and takes no bribe.  He executes
justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him
food and clothing.

Mahaparinirvana Sutra 259: Buddhist compassion is closer to the Western concept
of agape love.  It is not desire seeking fulfillment, but rather the
unconditional offering of love, like that of parents to their children. Based
on his compassion, Buddha is called the Father of the world in the Lotus Sutra
3, pp. 144f.  Tao Te Ching 79: By 'favoritism' is meant the perquisites which
the world gives to the rich and powerful.  Cf. Bhagavad Gita 9.29 and
comparable passages, pp. 278-82.  Sun Myung Moon, 4-16-88. Cf. Matthew 5.43.48,
p. 1000.  Deuteronomy 10.17-18: God liberated Israel from slavery; the
foundational experience of God in the Judeo-Christian tradition is as defender
of the poor and powerless.  Cf. 1 Samuel 2.4-9, pp. 545f.

O Rudra, that form of Yours which is benevolent, not fearful, not manifesting
the sinful, with that most beneficent form, You who extend happiness to
humankind from your mountain abode, reveal Yourself to us often.  This Rudra of
blue neck and red complexion, who glides aside, Him the shepherds saw, the
servant maids that bring water saw, and even [the lowliest of] all beings
saw--may He make us happy.

Obeisance to the God who is benevolent as well as terrible, who destroys beings
and is their protector as well.  Obeisance to the small and the puny, to the
big and the aged.  Obeisance to Him who is to be lauded with hymns and who is
there where hymns do not reach.  Obeisance to the redeemer, to the bringer of
peace and happiness, to the producer of well-being and joy. Obeisance to Him
who is auspicious and exceedingly so.

He [God] makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the
just and on the unjust.

The Tao is the refuge for the myriad creatures.
It is that by which the good man protects,
And that by which the bad is protected.

This world is a garden,

Cherishing all, none neglected.

Abundant is the year, with much millet and much rice;
And we have our high granaries,
With myriads, and hundreds of thousands, and millions [of measures in them];
For spirits and sweet spirits,
To present our ancestors, male and female,
And to supply all our ceremonies.
The blessings sent down on us are of every kind.

The scent of the sakaki leaves is fragrant;
Drawing near, I see countless kinsmen
Assembled all around,
Assembled all around.

On divine-dwelling mountain of sacred altar,
The sakaki leaves have grown thick
In the presence of the kami.
Before the kami
They have grown in profusion.

                            31. Shinto.  Kagura-Uta

The great Tao flows everywhere;
It can go left; it can go right.
The myriad things owe their existence to it,
And it does not reject them.
When its work is accomplished,
It does not take possession.
It clothes and feeds all,
But does not pose as their master.
Ever without ambition,
It may be called Small.
All things return to it as their home,
And yet it does not pose as their master,
Therefore it may be called Great.
Because it would never claim greatness,
Therefore its greatness is fully realized.

                          32. Taoism.  Tao Te Ching 34

It is He who sends down to you out of heaven water of which you may drink, and
by which [grow] trees, for you to pasture your herds, and thereby He brings
forth for you crops, and olives, and palms, and vines, and all manner of fruit.

Surely in that is a sign for a people who reflect.

And He subjected for you the night and day, and the sun and moon; and the stars
are subjected by His command.

Surely in that are signs for a people who understand.

And He has multiplied for you in the earth things of diverse hues. Surely in
that is a sign for a people who remember.

It is He who subjected for you the sea, that you may eat of it fresh flesh, and
bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and you may see the ships
cleaving through it; that you may seek of His bounty, and so haply you will be
thankful....

If you count God's blessing, you can never number it; surely God is
All-forgiving, All-compassionate.

Kagura-Uta: The branches of the sakaki tree, called tamagushi, are sacred in
Shinto rites, and worshippers attach to them their offerings of hemp and paper
streamers containing the prayers and fortunes of loved ones.  The branches
symbolize the spirit of the kami bestowing blessings to the world. Shinto
worship incorporates ritual dances (kagura) which seek to bring about harmony
in the universe.  In the Kojiki, the kami are themselves seen performing a
cosmic dance.  Compare the dance of Shiva in Hinduism, which has both a
creative and preservative role.  Cf. One Hundred Poems on the Jewelled Spear,
pp. 780f.  Tao Te Ching 34: This selfless Tao is the way of the sage; cf Tao Te
Ching 2, p. 941.  Qur'an 16.10-18: Cf. Qur'an 6.95-99, pp. 76f.; 30.20-25, p.

Know, Kashyapa!
It is like unto a great cloud
Rising above the world,
Covering all things everywhere,
A gracious cloud full of moisture;
Lightning-flames flash and dazzle,
Voice of thunder vibrates afar,
Bringing joy and ease to all.
The sun's rays are veiled,
And the earth is cooled;
The cloud lowers and spreads
As if it might be caught and gathered;
Its rain everywhere equally
Descends on all sides,
Streaming and pouring unstinted,
Permeating the land.
On mountains, by rivers, in valleys,
In hidden recesses, there grow
The plants, trees, and herbs;
Trees, both great and small,
The shoots of the ripening grain,
Grape vine and sugar cane.
Fertilized are these by the rain
And abundantly enriched;
The dry ground is soaked,
Herbs and trees flourish together.
From the one water which
Issued from that cloud,
Plants, trees, thickets, forests,
According to their need receive moisture.
All the various trees,
Lofty, medium, low,
Each according to its size,
Grows and develops
Roots, stalks, branches, leaves,
Blossoms and fruits in their brilliant colors;
Wherever the one rain reaches,
All become fresh and glossy.
According as their bodies, forms
And natures are great or small,
So the enriching rain,
Though it is one and the same,
Yet makes each of them flourish.

In like manner also the Buddha
Appears here in the world,
Like unto a great cloud
Universally covering all things;
And having appeared in the world,
He, for the sake of the living,
Discriminates and proclaims
The truth in regard to all laws.
The Great Holy World-honored One,
Among the gods and men
And among the other beings,
Proclaims abroad this word:
"I am the Tathagata,
The Most Honored among men;
I appear in the world
Like unto this great cloud,
To pour enrichment on all
Parched living beings,
To free them from their misery
To attain the joy of peace,
Joy of the present world,
And joy of Nirvana....

Upon all I ever look
Everywhere impartially,
Without distinction of persons,
Or mind of love or hate.
I have no predilections
Nor any limitations;
Ever to all beings
I preach the Law equally;
As I preach to one person,
So I preach to all.
Ever I proclaim the Law,
Engaged in naught else;
Going, coming, sitting, standing,
Never am I weary of
Pouring it copious on the world,
Like the all-enriching rain.
On honored and humble, high and low,
Law-keepers and law-breakers,
Those of perfect character,
And those of imperfect,
Orthodox and heterodox,
Quick-witted and dull-witted,
Equally I rain the Law-rain
Unwearyingly."

Lotus Sutra 5: This Parable of the Rain Cloud describes the impartial and equal
care which the Buddha gives to all creatures.  In addition, it speaks to the
specific issue of this sutra, which is the unity of the various paths
(shravaka-vehicle, pratyekabuddha-vehicle, and bodhisattva-vehicle) as stepping
stones in the overarching dispensation of the Buddha--the One Vehicle.
