                                   True Love
                                World Scripture

                                   TRUE LOVE

When the individual realizes Truth and fulfills God's purpose for his life, he
comes to embody universal love.  He delights in the well-being of others and
selflessly works for their benefit.  Love or Compassion, being the core of
Ultimate Reality, is expressed in the love of the saint who can rise above
self-centered attachments and desires.  It is true love, love that is totally
committed to the welfare of the other.  It is love that is universal,
overcoming the ordinary tendency to self-centeredness or favoritism for one's
own.

The ideal of love described in this section is rare in the world. Such love
requires the foundation of integrity, truthfulness, and unity with the Absolute
as described in the previous section on Perfection. Other passages which
describe love as an ethic can be found under Loving Kindness, pp. 826-30.

This section opens with several well-known passages that describe human love as
grounded in divine love: 1 John 4 and 1 Corinthians 13 of the Christian Bible,
from the Bhagavad Gita, and the Buddhist Metta Sutta.  The following passages
describe divine love as universal, flowing impartially to all beings,
insentient to likes and dislikes.

The last three passages discuss true love from the standpoint of love in the
family.  On the one hand, as love for children and love for spouse are the most
intense of human loves, such love is the standard that should be universally
applied to all.  Thus a Buddhist sutra states that the bodhisattva loves
everyone as though they were a loved only child.  On the other hand, even love
of family often succumbs to partiality; as the Confucian passage from the
Doctrine of the Mean cautions, it is not true love if the personal foundation
is not right.

Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God, and he who loves is born
of God and knows God.  He who does not love does not know God; for God is love.

No man has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love
is perfected in us.  By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because
he has given us of his own Spirit.

There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.  For fear has to do
with punishment, and he who fears is not perfected in love.  We love, because
he first loved us.  If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is
a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God
whom he has not seen.

              1. Christianity.  Bible, 1 John 4.7-8, 12-13, 18-20

The infinite joy of touching the Godhead is easily attained by those who are
free from the burden of evil and established within themselves.  They see the
Self in every creature and all creation in the Self.  With consciousness
unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye.

I am ever present into those who have realized Me in every creature. Seeing all
life as My manifestation, they are never separated from Me. They worship Me in
the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from Me.  Wherever they may
live, they abide in Me.

When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his
own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union.

                      2. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 6.28-32

If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy
gong or a clanging cymbal.  And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all
mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove
mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.  If I give away all I have, and if
I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.

Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant
or rude.  Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or
resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.  Love bears
all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they
will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.  For our knowledge is
imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; but when the perfect comes, the
imperfect will pass away.  When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought
like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish
ways.  For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.  Now I know in
part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.  So
faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

He who is skilled in welfare, who wishes to attain that calm state (Nibbana),
should act thus: He should be able, upright, perfectly upright, of noble
speech, gentle, and humble.  Contented, easily supported, with few wants and
simple tastes, with senses calmed, discreet, not impudent, not greedily
attached to families....

[He should always hold this thought,]  "May all beings be happy and secure, may
their hearts be wholesome!  Whatever living beings there be: feeble or strong,
tall, stout or medium, short, small or large, without exception; seen or
unseen, those dwelling far or near, those who are born or those yet unborn--may
all beings be happy!"

Let none deceive another, nor despise any person whatsoever in any place. Let
him not wish any harm to another out of anger or ill-will.  Just as a mother
would protect her only child at the risk of her own life, even so, let him
cultivate a boundless heart towards all beings.  Let his thoughts of boundless
love pervade the whole world: above, below, and across without any obstruction,
without any hatred, without any enmity. Whether he stands, walks, sits or lies
down, as long as he is awake, he should develop this mindfulness.  This, they
say, is the noblest living here.

Now, I am jealous of no one,
Now that I have attained unto the Society of the Saints:
I am estranged with no one: nor is anyone a stranger to me,
Indeed, I am the friend of all.
All that God does, with that I am pleased;
This is the wisdom I have received from the saints.
Yea, the One God pervades all: and, seeing Him,
I am wholly in bloom.

Wadhans 1.1: This is a good test of whether an emotion is godly love or
ordinary love.  Godly love is all-embracing, while ordinary love focuses on one
object exclusively, thereby inciting jealousy.  Godly love seeks to benefit
others, while ordinary love is tinged with selfish desire.  Cf. Asa-ki-Var
21.1, p. 1000; Sun Myung Moon, 9-11-77, p. 274.

He lets his mind pervade one quarter of the world with thoughts of love, and so
the second, and so the third, and so the fourth.  And thus the whole wide
world, above, below, around, and everywhere, does he continue to pervade with
the heart of love, far-reaching, exalted, beyond measure. Just as a mighty
trumpeter makes himself heard--and that without difficulty--in all the four
directions; even so of all things that have the shape of life there is not one
that he passes by or leaves aside, but regards them all with mind set free, and
deep-felt love.  Verily this is the way to a state of union with Brahma.

All humanity should walk the path of love.  True peace and a world of joy
cannot be realized without love.  Happiness is the same.  Can you feel
happiness alone?  You can only feel true happiness when you are able to have a
reciprocal relationship of love with another.

Freedom is the same.  You cannot experience freedom alone; it can only be
achieved through love and within love.  You don't feel tired in the place of
true love.  No matter how exhausted you are, if you are intoxicated with love
and you burst into tears out of love then your tiredness will suddenly
disappear.  When you feel true love you don't feel hungry or tired.  Also you
do not feel afraid of death.

What is meant by saying that the regulation of the family depends on the
cultivation of the personal life is this: Men are partial toward those for whom
they have affection and whom they love, partial toward those whom they despise
and dislike, partial toward those whom they fear and revere, partial toward
those whom they pity and for whom they have compassion, and partial toward
those whom they do not respect.  Therefore there are few people in the world
who know what is bad in those whom they love and what is good in those whom
they dislike.  Hence it is said, People do not know the faults of their sons
and do not know [are not satisfied with] the bigness of their seedlings. This
is what is meant by saying that if the personal life is not cultivated, one
cannot regulate his family.

If you step on a stranger's foot in the marketplace, you apologize at length
for your carelessness.  If you step on your older brother's foot, you give him
an affectionate pat, and if you step on your parent's foot, you know you are
already forgiven.  So it is said, "Perfect ritual makes no distinction of
persons; perfect righteousness takes no account of things [wealth]; perfect
knowledge does not scheme; perfect benevolence knows no [partiality in]
affection; perfect trust dispenses with gold."

Great Learning 8: Confucianism teaches that one should be partial towards one's
own family and relatives--yet only as the starting point for a social ethic
which is an expansion of family relations--cf. Mencius I.A.7, p. 971. To
counter the tendency of partiality to become corrupt, another aspect to
Confucian teaching is the search for a universal objective basis for action in
the world: the cultivation of personal virtue.  Each person should have a
foundation of benevolence within himself or herself in order that love--both to
family and to strangers--may be correct.  Cf. Mencius II.A.6, p. 216; Mencius
VII.B.6, p. 968.  Chuang Tzu 23: Perfect action is spontaneous, heartfelt,
trusting, and intimate; it dispenses with formalities.  It can only exist where
there is true love.  Cf. Tao Te Ching 49, p. 1000.

The bodhisattva, the great being, having practiced compassion, sympathy, and
joy, attains the stage of the best-loved only son.  For example, the father and
mother greatly rejoice as they see their son at peace.  The same is the case
with the bodhisattva who abides in this stage: he sees all beings just as the
parents see their only son.  Seeing him practicing good, he greatly rejoices.
So we call this stage the best-loved.

For example, the father and mother are worried at heart as they see their son
ill.  Commiseration poisons their heart; the mind cannot part with the illness.
So it is with the bodhisattva, the great being, who abides in this stage.  As
he sees beings bound up in the illness of illusion, his heart aches.  He is
worried as in the case of an only son. Blood comes out from all pores of the
skin.  That is why we call this stage as that of an only son.

A child picks up earth, dirty things, tiles, stones, old bones, pieces of wood
and puts them into his mouth, at which the father and mother, apprehensive of
the harms that might arise thereby, take the child with the left hand and with
the right take these out.  The same goes with the bodhisattva: he sees that all
beings are not grown up to the stage of law body and that non-good is done in
body, speech, and mind.  The bodhisattva sees, and with the hand of wisdom has
it extracted.  He does not wish that man should repeat birth and death,
receiving thereby sorrow and worry.

When a father and mother part with their beloved son as the son dies, their
hearts so ache that they feel that they themselves should die together with
him.  The same is the case with the bodhisattva: as he sees a benighted person
fall into hell, he himself desires to be born there, too. [He thinks,] "Perhaps
the man, as he experiences the pain, may gain a moment of repentance where I
can speak to him of the Law in various ways and enable him to gain a thought of
good."

For the father and mother of an only son, in sleep or while awake, or while
walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, their minds always think of the son.
If he does wrong, they give kindly advice and lead the boy that he does not do
evil any more.  The same is the case of the bodhisattva: as he sees beings fall
into the realms of hell, hungry ghosts and animals, or sees them doing good and
evil in the world of man and in heaven, his mind is ever upon them and not
apart from them.  He may see them doing all evil, yet he does not become angry
or punish with evil intent.

Mahaparinirvana Sutra 470-71: The love of a mother for her only child, as
developed in this Mahayana text as the way of the bodhisattva, is similar to
the Theravada concept of compassion as set forth in the Metta Sutta (above).
Cf. Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 5, p. 495.  The 'stage of law body' is the
complete realization of Buddhahood, when one is totally identical with Reality,
the Dharmakaya.
