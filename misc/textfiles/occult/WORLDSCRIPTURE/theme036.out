                                    Dominion
                                World Scripture

                                    DOMINION

Although we humans are part of the natural world, we have a unique position in
it that makes us superior to all other beings.  This is not a matter of
physical size or strength, for on that scale of things we are only
infinitesimal specks on a planet that is itself but a speck in the infinite
reaches of the universe.  Rather, the reason humans are regarded as the crown
of creation is due entirely to our unique spiritual endowment.  Humans have the
ability, unparalleled in the natural world, to know God and to attain  the
transcendent purpose. In the special intimacy which we share with God, humans
are potentially of more value than the entire world of creation.  In this
light, the bounty of creation has been regarded as a gift of divine love.

In the Abrahamic religions, humans are said to have been created as God's
"viceregents" and granted the blessing of dominion over all things.  All things
exist for our benefit, by which we can develop ourselves to become co-creators
with God.  Furthermore, humans are uniquely able to have dominion because we
can understand the nature of all other creatures--symbolized by our giving them
names.  The blessing of dominion was not originally sanction for developing
technology to extract wealth and a comfortable artificial environment at the
expense of nature; in the agricultural societies for which this mandate was
first given, human creativity was seen as essentially in harmony with natural
processes.  Today it may be interpreted as a call for artistic and creative
projects to enhance the beauty and productivity of nature and the quality of
human life.

Do you not see that God has subjected to your use all things in the heavens and
on earth, and has made His bounties flow to you in exceeding measure, both seen
and unseen?

                            1. Islam.  Qur'an 31.20

I will create a vicegerent on earth.

                             2. Islam.  Qur'an 2.30

And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill
the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over
the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."

                3. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Genesis 1.28

When I look at Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers,
the moon and the stars which Thou hast established;
What is man that Thou art mindful of him,
and the son of man that Thou dost care for him?
Yet Thou hast made him little less than God,
and dost crown him with glory and honor.
Thou hast given him dominion over the works of Thy hands;
Thou hast put all things under his feet.

                4. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Psalm 8.3-6

God is He who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down rain from the
skies, and with it brings forth fruits to feed you; it is He who made the ships
subject to you, that they may sail through the sea by His command; and the
rivers He has made subject to you.  And He made subject to you the sun and the
moon, both diligently pursuing their courses; and the night and the day He has
made subject to you.  And He gives you of all that you ask for.  But if you
count the favors of God, never will you be able to number them.  Verily, man is
given up to injustice and ingratitude.

                           5. Islam.  Qur'an 14.32-34

The whole world was created only for the sake of the righteous man.  He weighs
as much as the whole world.  The whole world was created only to be united to
him.

                        6. Judaism.  Talmud, Shabbat 30b

Truly do I exist in all beings, but I am most manifest in man.  The human heart
is My favorite dwelling place.

We did indeed offer the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains;
but they refused to undertake it, being afraid of it.  But man undertook it; he
was indeed unjust and foolish.

                            8. Islam.  Qur'an 33.72

His movement is of Heaven, his stillness of Earth.  With his single mind in
repose, he is king of the world; the spirits do not afflict him; his soul knows
no weariness.  His single mind reposed, the ten thousand things submit--which
is to say that his emptiness and stillness reach throughout Heaven and Earth
and penetrate the ten thousand things.  This is what is called Heavenly joy.
Heavenly joy is the mind of the sage by which he shepherds the world.

                            9. Taoism.  Chuang Tzu 13

Man, as the manifestation of God, is the leader of all things, and no creature
is more honorable than man.  All things upon the earth, following their own
individual names, fashioning their true way, will know that Thou hast brought
them to sight for man's sake.  All things whatsoever, forgetting not their
source, deviating not from their determined pattern, are made to work as well
as to understand their part; humbling themselves and honoring man, without
anger, without haste, without anxiety, without grief, neither linked nor
parted, they are made to work out their true personality.

                 10. Perfect Liberty Kyodan.  The Ritual Prayer

Having created the world and all that lives and moves therein, He, through the
direct operation of His unconstrained and sovereign Will, chose to confer upon
man the unique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love Him--a capacity
that must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary purpose
underlying the whole of creation....  Upon the inmost reality of each and every
created thing He has shed the light of one of His names, and made it a
recipient of the glory of one of His attributes.  Upon the reality of man,
however, He has focused the radiance of all of His names and attributes, and
made it a mirror of His own Self.  Alone of all created things man has been
singled out for so great a favor, so enduring a bounty.

Qur'an 33.72: The 'Trust' means the responsibility to choose good and reject
evil, to live by God's purposes.  Among all created beings, only humans have
free will and the responsibility it confers.  Yet we have abused it.  Cf.
Shabbat 886-89a, p. 313.  Gleanings from the Writings of Baha'u'llah 27: Cf.
Aitareya Upanishad 1.1-3.12, pp. 306f.; Sun Myung Moon, 9-30-79, p. 307;

Rangi and Papa, or Heaven and Earth, were the source from which, in the
beginning, all things originated.  Darkness then rested upon the heaven and
upon the earth, and they still both cleave together, and the children they had
begotten were ever thinking amongst themselves what might be the difference
between darkness and light.  Hence the ancient saying, "There was darkness from
the first division of time, unto the tenth, to the hundredth, to the
thousandth."

At last the beings who had been begotten by Heaven and Earth, worn out by the
continued darkness, consulted amongst themselves, saying, "Let us now determine
what we should do with Rangi and Papa, whether it would be better to slay them
or to rend them apart."  Then spoke Tumatauenga, the fiercest of the children
of Heaven and Earth, "Let us slay them."  But Tane-mahuta, the father of
forests and all things that inhabit them, said, "Nay, not so.  It is better to
rend them apart, and to let heaven stand far above us, and the earth lie
beneath our feet.  Let the sky become a stranger to us, but the earth remain
close to us as a nursing mother."  Five of the brothers consented to this
proposal, but not Tawhiri-ma-tea, the father of winds and storms. He, fearing
that his kingdom was about to be overthrown, grieved greatly at the thought of
his parents being torn apart.

Then Rongo-ma-tane, the god and father of cultivated food, rises up to rend
apart the heavens and the earth; he struggles, but is unable to rend them
apart.  Next Tangaroa, the god and father of fish and reptiles rises up; he
struggles, but he is unable to rend them apart. Next Haumia-tikitiki, the god
and father of the food which springs up without cultivation, rises up and
struggles, but he, too fails.  At last, slowly rises Tane-mahuta, the god and
father of forests, birds, and insects, and he struggles with his parents. With
his head firmly planted on mother earth and his feet upraised and resting
against the skies, he strains his back and limbs with mighty effort and rends
apart Rangi and Papa, all the while insensible to their shrieks and cries. Thus
it is said, "It was the fierce thrusting of Tane which tore the heaven from the
earth, so that they were rent apart, and darkness was made manifest, and so was
the light."

Then there arose in the breast of Tawhiri-ma-tea, the god and father of winds
and storms, a fierce desire to wage war with his brothers, because they had
rent apart their common parents without his consent.  So he rises, follows his
father to the realms above, and hurries to the sheltered hollows in the
boundless skies; there he consults long with his father, and as the vast Heaven
listens to the suggestions of Tawhiri-ma-tea, thoughts and plans are formed in
his breast, and Tawhiri-ma-tea also understands what he should do. Then by
himself and vast Heaven were begotten his numerous brood: the mighty winds,
squalls, whirlwinds, dense clouds, massy clouds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery
clouds, clouds reflecting glowing red light, and the wildly bursting clouds of
thunderstorms.  In the midst of these, Tawhiri-ma-tea sweeps wildly on.  Alas!
alas! then rages the fierce hurricane; and while Tane-mahuta and his gigantic
forests stand unconscious and unsuspecting, the blast of the breath of the
mouth of Tawhiri-ma-tea smites them, the gigantic trees are snapt off right in
the middle.  Alas! they are rent to atoms, dashed to the earth, with boughs and
branches torn and scattered, lying on the earth, left for the insect, for the
grub, and for loathsome rottenness.

Tawhiri-ma-tea next swoops down upon the seas, and lashes in his wrath the
ocean.  Ah! ah! waves steep as cliffs rise, with tops so lofty as to make one
giddy; these soon eddy into whirlpools, and Tangaroa, the god of the ocean and
father of all that dwell therein, flies affrighted through the seas....

Tawhiri-ma-tea next rushed on to attack his brothers Rongo-ma-tane and
Haumia-tikitiki, the gods and progenitors of cultivated and uncultivated food,
but Papa, to save these for her other children, caught them up and hid them in
a place of safety; and so well were they concealed by their mother Earth that
he sought for them in vain.

Tawhiri-ma-tea, having thus vanquished all his other brothers, next rushed
against Tumatauenga, to try his strength against his; he exerted all his force
against him, but he could neither shake him nor prevail against him.  What did
Tumatauenga care for his brother's wrath? He was the only one of the whole
party of brothers who had proposed to kill their parents.  Now, against the
storm winds, he shows himself brave and fierce in war.  His other brothers had
been broken or fled or had been hidden, but Tumatauenga, or man, still stood
erect and unshaken upon the breast of his mother Earth.

Tumatauenga reflected upon the cowardly manner in which his brothers had acted,
in leaving him to show his courage alone, and he determined to turn against
them.  To injure Tane-mahuta, he collected leaves and made snares--ha! ha! the
children of Tane fell before him, none could any longer fly in safety. To take
revenge on his brother Tangaroa, he sought for his offspring leaping and
swimming in the water. He netted nets with flax, dragged with them, and hauled
the children of Tangaroa ashore.  To be revenged upon his brothers
Rongo-ma-tane and Haumia-tikitiki, he soon found them by their distinctive
leaves, and scraping into shape a wooden hoe and plaiting a basket, he dug in
the earth and pulled up all kinds of plants with edible roots.

Thus Tumatauenga deposed four of his brothers, and they became his food. But
one of them, Tawhiri-ma-tea, he could not vanquish by eating him for food, so
this last-born child of Heaven and Earth was left as an enemy for man, and
still this brother ever attacks him in storms and hurricanes, to destroy him
alike on sea and land.

Maori Tradition:  On the primordial androgyne, cf. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
1.4.3, p. 252. On separating light from darkness as the first act of creation,
compare Genesis 1, p. 126.  This story is also interpreted to show the origin
of evil: from the parricide of the primordial family has come division and
strife between man and man.
