                            Prepare Now for Eternity
                                World Scripture

                            PREPARE NOW FOR ETERNITY

Generally, religions do not expound on the reality of a future life merely as a
comfort to the bereaved or as an opiate for those oppressed in this life.
Rather, the fact of a future life enhances the purpose and meaning of this
life.  How a person lives in the world will do much to determine his or her
ultimate destiny.  Indeed, it is often taught that life in the world is the
only chance to prepare for life in eternity.  The link between deed and
retribution is not severed by death; often it is only in the next life that
what has been sown through actions while on earth is completely reaped.
Likewise, a person's qualities of character survive death: as a person was good
or evil in this life, so he will continue to enjoy goodness or be pained by
evil in the next.  Therefore, the wise person lives with an eye to eternity by
accumulating merit, repenting for misdeeds, and seeking to clear up all
accounts before the day of his death.  Generally, the proper preparation for
the life in the hereafter is seen as extending throughout one's life, even from
one's youth.  For one who prepares for death, death is not something to be
feared.  But to those who are heedless of this principle death comes suddenly,
leaving them eternally full of regret. See also Repentance, pp. 901-09.

As the fallow leaf of the tree falls to the ground, when its days are gone,
even so is the life of men; Gautama, be careful all the while!

As the dew-drop dangling on the top of a blade of grass lasts but a short time,
even so the life of men; Gautama, be careful all the while!

A life so fleet, and existence so precarious, wipe off the sins you ever
committed; Gautama, be careful all the while!

A rare chance, in the long course of time, is human birth for a living being;
hard are the consequences of actions; Gautama, be careful all the while!

And we see that death comes upon mankind... nevertheless there was a space
granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a
probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that
endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection
of the dead.

Better is one hour of repentance and good works in this world than all the life
in the world to come, and better is one hour of calmness of spirit in the world
to come than all the life of this world.

If any do wish for the transitory things of life, We readily grant them such
things as We will, to such persons as We will.  But in the end We have provided
hell for them; they will burn therein, disgraced and rejected.  But those who
wish for the things of the hereafter, and strive for them with all due
striving, and have faith--they are the ones whose striving is acceptable to God.

Tzu-lu asked how one should serve ghosts and spirits.  The Master said, "Till
you have learnt to serve men, how can you serve ghosts?"  Tzu-lu then ventured
upon a question about the dead.  The Master said, "Till you know about the
living, how are you to know about the dead?"

When the Master was very ill, Tzu-lu asked leave to perform the Rite of
Expiation.  The Master said, "Is there such a thing?"  Tzu-lu answered saying,
"There is.  In one of the Dirges it says, 'We performed rites of expiation for
you, calling upon the sky-spirits above and the earth-spirits below.'"  The
Master said, "My expiation began long ago!"

Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume
and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasure in
heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in
and steal.  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Men who have not led a religious life and have not laid up treasure in their

[The soul] cannot be taken from its place of deposit; it does not perish
anywhere by fire; if kings of surpassing grandeur are angry they cannot take it
away; and therefore what any man should provide for his children as a legacy is
learning.  Other things are not real wealth.

Relatives and friends and well-wishers rejoice at the arrival of a man who had
been long absent and has returned home safely from afar. Likewise, meritorious
deeds will receive the good person upon his arrival in the next world, as
relatives welcome a dear one on his return.

Giving no pain to any creature, a person should slowly accumulate spiritual
merit for the sake of acquiring a companion in the next world....

For in the next world neither father, nor mother, nor wife, nor sons, nor

O people!  Fear God, and whatever you do, do it anticipating death.  Try to
attain everlasting blessing in return for transitory and perishable wealth,
power and pleasures of this world.

Be prepared for a fast passage because here you are destined for a short stay.
Always be ready for death, for you are living under its shadow. Be wise like
people who have heard the message of God and have taken a warning from it.

Beware that this world is not made for you to live forever, you will have to
change it for hereafter.  God, glory be to Him, has not created you without a
purpose and has not left you without duties, obligations, and
responsibilities....

You must remember to gather from this life such harvest as will be of use and
help to you hereafter.

Both life and death of such as are firm in their penance and rules are good.
When alive they earn merit and when dead they attain beatitude.

Both life and death of such as indulge in sins are bad.  When alive they add to
malice and when dead they are hurled into darkness.

 Here he grieves, hereafter he grieves.  In both states the evil-doer grieves.
He grieves, he is afflicted, perceiving the impurity of his own deeds.

Here he rejoices, hereafter he rejoices.  In both states the well-doer
rejoices.  He rejoices, exceedingly rejoices, perceiving the purity of his own
deeds.

Here he suffers, hereafter he suffers.  In both states the evil-doer suffers.
"Evil have I done"--thinking thus, he suffers.  Having gone to a woeful state,
he suffers even more.

Here he is happy, hereafter he is happy.  In both states the well-doer is
happy.  "Good have I done"--thinking thus, he is happy.  Upon going to a
blissful state, he rejoices even more.

As for that abode of the Hereafter, We assign it to those who seek not
oppression in the earth, nor corruption.  The sequel is for those who ward off
evil.  Whoever brings a good deed, he will have better than the same; while as
for him who brings an ill deed, those who do ill deeds will be requited only
what they did.

Matthew 18.18: Jesus gives the authority to bind and loose to his disciples,
and hence to the church; compare Matthew 16.19, p. 286, where that authority is
given only to Peter.  For Catholics, this passage refers mainly to the
discipline and grace dispensed by the church, which, when determined on earth,
endures in heaven.  But for Protestants, who reject the mediation of a
priesthood, the blessings of Christ are freely available to every believer as
he avails himself of them through the sacraments, prayer, and good deeds. Hence
ultimately it is the individual's own binding or loosing, while on earth, that
will bind or liberate in heaven.  Qur'an 28.83-84: Cf. Majjhima Nikaya
i.389-90, p. 345.

Sooner, do I declare, would a one-eyed turtle, if he were to pop up to the

Rivalry in worldly increase distracts you
Until you visit the graves.
Nay, but you will come to know!
Again, you will come to know!
Would that you knew now with certainty of mind!
For you will behold hell-fire;
Indeed, you will behold it with sure vision.
Then, on that day, you will be asked concerning pleasure.

The untrustworthy lord of death
Waits not for things to be done or undone;
Whether I am sick or healthy,
This fleeting life span is unstable.

Leaving all I must depart alone.
But through not having understood this
I committed various kinds of evil
For the sake of my friends and foes.

Yet my foes will become nothing.
My friends will become nothing.
I too will become nothing.
Likewise all will become nothing.

Just like a dream experience,
Whatever things I enjoy
Will become a memory.
Whatever has passed will not be seen again.

Even within this brief life
Many friends and foes have passed,
But whatever unbearable evil I committed for them
Remains ahead of me....

While I am lying in bed,
Although surrounded by my friends and relatives,
The feeling of life being severed
Will be experienced by me alone.

When seized by the messengers of death,
What benefit will friends and relatives afford?
My merit alone shall protect me then,
But upon that I have never relied.
