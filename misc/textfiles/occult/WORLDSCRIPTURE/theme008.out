                      Eternal -- In A World of Transience
                                World Scripture

                      ETERNAL -- IN A WORLD OF TRANSIENCE

Ultimate Reality is eternal and unchanging.  The monotheistic religious claim
is that God is absolute, eternal, and unchanging; a similar teaching applies to
other religious conceptions of the Absolute: Nirvana, Dhamma, the Dharmakaya,
the Tao, and in the I Ching the ground of Change itself.  The complementary
assertion, which is central to Buddhism and other Eastern religions but also
found in analogous expressions in the monotheistic faiths, is that all beings,
things, and phenomena in the world are transient, impermanent, conditioned, and
hence less than truly Real. These two doctrines are presented together as the
positive and negative poles of a single truth.

Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!

Revelation 4.8 and Targum Jonathan: These two passages illustrate the operation
of midrashic exegesis, where each detail in the word of God is plumbed for its
meaning.  The question, "Why is the word 'holy' repeated three times in Isaiah
6.3 (p. 99)?" is answered by a three-fold description of God's range over time
and space.  Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 4.4.25: Cf. Bhagavad Gita 13.32, p. 115.

All that is on the earth will perish:

In primal time, in all time, was the Creator;
Nothing is real but the Eternal.

The spirit of the valley never dies.
It is called the subtle and profound female.
The gate of the subtle and profound female
Is the root of heaven and earth.
It is continuous, and seems to be always existing.
Use it and you will never wear it out.

Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God
of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?' what
shall I say to them?"  God said to Moses, "I Am Who I Am."  And he said, "Say
this to the people of Israel, 'I Am' has sent me to you."

              9. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Exodus 3.13-15

The divine Mind maintains all identities, from a blade of grass to a star, as
distinct and eternal.  Nothing is real and eternal--nothing is Spirit--but God
and His idea.

Nothing can ever destroy the Buddha Nature.  The nature of self is nothing but
the undisclosed storehouse of the Tathagata.  Such a storehouse can never be
broken, put to fire, or plundered.  Though it is not possible to destroy or see
it, one can know it when one attains the unsurpassed enlightenment.

and cannot be changed.

Tao Te Ching 6: Cf. Tao Te Ching 4, p. 525.  This describes the eternal
feminine spirit; see p. 147.  Exodus 3.13-15: This passage, from Moses'
encounter with God at the burning bush, gives the traditional etymology of the
name of God, the Tetragrammaton YHWH, as The Eternal, 'I Am.'  This verse is
also the foundation of Christian and Jewish theological discussion of God's
unchangeability and eternity.  For another traditional Jewish interpretation of
this passage, see Torah Yesharah, p. 506.  Mahaparinivana Sutra 8.12: Cf. the
concept of Tathatagagarbha in Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala 13, p. 117.  Chuang

Change has neither thought nor action, because it is in the state of absolute
quiet and inactivity, and when acted on, it immediately penetrates all things.
If it were not the most spirit-like thing in the world, how can it take part in
this universal transformation?

Subhuti, if anyone should say that the Tathagata comes or goes or sits or
reclines, he fails to understand my teaching.  Why?  Because "Thus Gone"
(Tathagata) has neither whence nor whither, and therefore He is called
"Tathagata."

Listen each of you to the secret, mysterious, and supernatural power of the
Thus Come One.  All the worlds of gods, men, and demons declare, "Now has
Sakyamuni Buddha, coming forth from the palace of the Sakya clan, and seated at
the place of enlightenment, not far from the city of Gaya, attained to Perfect
Enlightenment."  But, good sons, since in fact I became Buddha, there have
passed infinite, boundless, hundreds, thousands, myriads, millions, trillions
of eons....  From that time forward I have constantly been preaching and
teaching in this universe, and also leading and benefiting the living in other
places in hundreds, thousands, myriads, millions, trillions of numberless
domains.

Diamond Sutra 29: 'Tathagata' is a title given to the Buddha. It means "Comes
thus far," i.e., the one who has arrived at the goal of enlightenment.  Lotus
Sutra 16: See also the parallel passage in verse, pp. 647f, 663.  The language
here has links to the concept of the Day of Brahman--see Bhagavad Gita 8.17-20,
p. 122--and with the thought that there is an historic manifestation of the
Eternal Buddha in every eon, much as with the Hindu doctrine of avatars--see
Bhagavad Gita 4.7-8, p. 662.  In the doctrine of the Trikaya (Three Bodies) of
Mahayana Buddhism, the Eternal Buddha of the Lotus Sutra is the Sambhogakaya
(Glorified Body), while the historical Buddha is the Nirmanakaya (Accommodated
Body).  The Ultimate Buddha, the Dharmakaya, is Reality itself; cf. Lion's Roar
of Queen Srimala 5, p. 652; Garland Sutra 37, p. 96.

The One who, himself without color, by the manifold application of his power
Distributes many colors in his hidden purpose,
And into whom, its end and its beginning, the whole world dissolves--
He is God!

                   19. Hinduism.  Svestasvatara Upanishad 4.1

Of old thou didst lay the foundation of the earth,
and the heavens are the work of thy hands;
They will perish,
but thou dost endure.
They will all wear out like a garment,
thou changest them like raiment, and they pass away.
But thou art the same,
and thy years have no end.

Who knows the Eternal's day
and the Eternal's night,
Each lasting a thousand ages, truly
knows day and night.
At daybreak all things are disclosed;
they arise from the unmanifest.
At dusk they dissolve into
the very same unmanifest.
Again and again, the whole multitude
of creatures is born, and when night falls,
Is dissolved, without their will,
and at daybreak, is born again.
Beyond that unmanifest is
another, everlasting unmanifest
Which has no end, although
every creature perish.
This is called the imperishable
unmanifest and the highest goal.
Who reaches it does not return.
It is my supreme abode.

dissolution.  Cf. Bhagavad Gita 9.4-10, p. 134; Katha Upanishad 1.3.15, p. 581;

The impermanent [objects of the senses] have no reality; reality lies in the
eternal.  Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the

All flesh is grass,

The grass withers, the flower fades,

The grass withers, the flower fades,

A star at dawn, a bubble in a stream;
A flash of lightning in a summer cloud,
A flickering lamp, a phantom, a dream.

The wise man looks upon life as a mere dew drop which quivers upon the tip of a
blade of kusa grass, to be whisked off or blown away by the breeze at any
moment.  The life of an unwise, imprudent, and ignorant person is likewise as
transient as said dew drop.

Who comes, finally comes not.  Who goes, finally goes not.  Why?  Who comes is
not known to come.  Who goes is not known to go.  Who appears is finally not to

                  29. Buddhism.  Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 5

In the world, inclusive of its gods, substance is seen in what is
insubstantial.  They are tied to their psychophysical beings and so they think
that there is some substance, some reality in them.

But whatever be the phenomenon through which they think of seeking their
self-identity, it turns out to be transitory.  It becomes false, for what lasts
for a moment is deceptive.

The state that is not deceptive is Nibbana: that is what the men of worth know
as being real.  With this insight into reality their hunger ends: cessation,
total calm.

Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 5:  This statement is from an exchange between
Manjusri and Vimalakirti when the Bodhisattva visits Vimalalakirti on his sick
bed.  Like any phenomenal existence, they conclude that Vimalakirti's illness
is ultimately unreal.  This is a general statement of the concept of sunya,
that all things are empty of any nature that is independent, discrete, and
permanent.  Also, compare John 14-15, where the going of Jesus is seen as a
coming, but both the going and coming are resolved in a presence.  Sutta Nipata
756-58: Cf. Udana 80, p. 75.
