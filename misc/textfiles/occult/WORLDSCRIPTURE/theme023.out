                                  PERFECTION

This and the following section describe the perfect virtues of the person who
is at one with the Absolute, who is firmly established in Truth, purity, and
integrity, who is without sin or bondage to worldly corruption, who exhibits
the fullness of sanctifying grace. Such a person may be called a saint, a sage,
an arahant, a siddha, a Buddha, a perfect man, or by other names.  There is
remarkable unanimity among religions as to what characterizes the realized or
perfected human being.

Such a person embodies in himself the perfections of Ultimate Reality.
Therefore he is truly in the Image of God, pp. 207-13. Furthermore, the saint
has overcome selfish desires and is purified of any feelings of lust, greed, or
other cravings.  He is unfettered by attachment to worldly concerns for wealth,
power, or reputation.  He is free from bondage to sin and does not have any
desire to commit sin: in Augustine's words, he is free to "love God and do what
you will."  He is unified within himself and has dominion over himself.  He has
risen above the world of change and conditions and therefore attains
immortality.  These characteristics of the saint are described in the passages
collected in this section.

You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

he sees, his hand by which he strikes, and his foot with which he walks."

Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all
ungodliness; and if you shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and love
God with all your might, mind, and strength, then is his grace sufficient
for you, that by his grace you may be perfect in Christ; and if by the
grace of God you are perfect in Christ, you can in no way deny the power of God.

Rabbi Me'ir said, "Whosoever labors in the Torah for its own sake merits many
things; and not only so, but the whole world is indebted to him: he is called
friend, beloved, a lover of the All-present, a lover of mankind; it clothes him
in meekness and reverence; it fits him to become just, pious, upright, and
faithful; it keeps him far from sin, and brings him near to virtue."

In this way [the superior] man comes to resemble heaven and earth; he is not in
conflict with them.  His wisdom embraces all things, and his Tao brings order
into the whole world; therefore he does not err.  He is active everywhere but
does not let himself be carried away.  He rejoices in heaven and has knowledge
of fate, therefore he is free of care.  He is content with his circumstances
and genuine in his kindness, therefore he can practice love.

The Supreme Soul (paramatman) is free from birth, old age, and death; he is
supreme, pure, and devoid of the eight karmas; he possesses infinite
knowledge, intuition, bliss, and potency; he is indivisible,
indestructible, and inexhaustible.  Besides, he is supersensuous and
unparalleled, is free from obstructions, merit, demerit, and rebirth, and
is eternal, steady, and independent.

                  10. Jainism.  Kundakunda, Niyamasara 176-77

The Supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have
conquered themselves.  They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and
pain, praise and blame.

They are completely filled by spiritual wisdom and have realized the Self.
Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human
consciousness.  To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same.
They are equally disposed to family, enemies, and friends, to those who support
them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they
are impartial, they rise to great heights.

The arahant monk, who has destroyed the cankers, lived the life, done what was
to be done, laid town the burden, won the goal, burst the bonds of becoming,
and is freed by the fullness of gnosis, cannot transgress nine standards: a
monk in whom the cankers are destroyed cannot deliberately take the life of any
living thing; cannot, with intention to steal, take what is not given; cannot
indulge in carnal intercourse; cannot intentionally tell a lie; cannot enjoy
pleasures from memories as of yore when a householder; a monk, in whom the
cankers are destroyed, cannot go astray through desire; cannot go astray
through hate; cannot go astray through delusion; cannot go astray through fear.

Clear: The name of a state achieved through auditing, or an individual who has
achieved this state.  A Clear is a being who no longer has a reactive mind.  A
Clear is an unaberrated person and is rational in that he forms the best
possible solutions he can on the data he has and from his viewpoint.

Operating Thetan: It is a state of beingness.  It is a being "at cause [can
assume responsibility] over matter, energy, space, time, form, and life."
Operating comes from "able to operate without dependency on things," and Thetan
is [from] the Greek letter theta, which the Greeks used to represent thought or
perhaps spirit....

Scientology 0-8: According to Scientology, spiritual attainment is on a
graduated scale.  The state of Clear is the level where an individual can
function optimally, without any negative thoughts or desires--the 'reactive
mind'--to confuse his reason.  It is achieved through training by a process of
instruction called 'auditing.'  'Operating Thetan' is an even higher stage, one
of total freedom in the world of being and able to take responsibility for all
things.  Atharva Veda 19.51.1: The human condition of internal conflict and
contradiction--Maitri Upanishad 6.34, p. 390; Bhagavad Gita 6.5-6, p. 391--is
overcome by one in perfect unity; cf. Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.1-3, p. 387.  This
verse also refers to the attainment of tranquillity and unity in meditation;
cf. Bhagavad Gita 6.10-27, p. 845.

While there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the mind may
be said to be in a state of equilibrium (chung).  When those feelings have been
stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues what may be called the
state of harmony (ho).  This equilibrium is the great root from which grow all
the human actings in the world, and this harmony is the universal path which
they all should pursue.  Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in
perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all
things will be nourished and flourish.

and vindication from the God of his salvation.
Such is the generation of those who seek Thee,
who seek the face of the God of Jacob.

Decalogue; see Exodus 20.1-17, p. 166.  This psalm was sung in ancient Israel

qualifications to enter its holy precincts.  Cf. Yasna 60.21, p. 721.  Matthew
5.3-10: These are the first eight of the nine Beatitudes.  They proclaim God's
favor to those who fear Him, who have cast off egoism, and who aspire to do His
will.  'Poor in spirit' refers to those who recognize their spiritual poverty
though they may know countless doctrines and formal teachings--cf. 1
Corinthians 1.18-25, p. 798.  'Those who mourn' expresses the fact that people
in the lower classes of society who suffer grief, poverty, and oppression are
often less bound by attachments to worldly things and more able to receive
God's wisdom--cf. Matthew 19.21-24, p. 939; Luke 18.10-14, p. 902. 'The meek'
are not puffed up with pride and do not act arrogantly towards others.  They
are the little children to whom belongs the Kingdom of heaven--cf. Luke
18.16-17, p. 912.  'Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness' have a deep
sense of empathy with the suffering of others and are not just concerned with
their own situation.  On the 'pure in heart,' cf. 2 Timothy 2.21-22, p. 729.

Arjuna: Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the
Self, O Krishna.  How do they talk?  How sit?  How move about?

Lord Krishna: They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them,
who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart.

Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from
lust and fear and anger.  Established in meditation, they are truly wise.
Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good
fortune nor depressed by bad.  Such are the seers.

Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at
will.  Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them.
These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal.  Even of those who
tread the path, the stormy senses can sweep off the mind.  They live in wisdom
who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in Me.

For him who has completed the journey, for him who is sorrowless, for him who
from everything is wholly free, for him who has destroyed all ties, the fever
of passion exists not.

He whose corruptions are destroyed, he who is not attached to food, he who has
deliverance, which is void [of lust, hate, and ignorance] and signless [without
the signs of lust, etc.], as his object--his path, like that of the birds of
the air, cannot be traced.

He whose senses are subdued, like steeds well-trained by a charioteer, he whose
pride is destroyed and is free from the corruptions--such a steadfast one even
the gods hold dear.

Like the earth, a balanced and well-disciplined person resents not.... He is
like a pool, unsullied by mud; to such a balanced one, life's wanderings do not
arise.

Calm is his mind, calm is his speech, calm is his action, who, rightly knowing,
is wholly freed [from defilements], perfectly peaceful and equipoised.

The man who is not credulous but truly understands the Uncreated (Nibbana), who
has cut off the links, who has put an end to occasion [of good and evil], who
has eschewed all desires, he indeed is a supreme man.

He who possesses virtue in abundance
May be compared to an infant.
Poisonous insects will not sting him.
Fierce beasts will not seize him.
Birds of prey will not strike him.
His bones are weak, his sinews tender, but his grasp is firm.
He does not yet know the union of male and female,
But his organ is aroused.
This means that his essence is at its height.
He may cry all day without becoming hoarse,
This means that his natural harmony is perfect.
To know harmony means to be in accord with the eternal.
To be in accord with the eternal means to be enlightened.

Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, patient,
contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all his heart and all his mind
given to me--with such a one I am in love.

Not frightening the world or by it frightened, he stands above the sway of
elation, competition, and fear--he is my beloved.

He is detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all his
undertakings--he is my devotee, very dear to me.

Running not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieving not, lusting
not, but letting things come and go as they happen--he is very dear to me.

That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed
up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain,
free from selfish attachments, the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever
full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith--such a one is dear to me.

Those who meditate upon this immortal Truth as I have declared it, full of
faith and seeking me as life's supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love
for them is very great.

way, and who has reached the Highest Goal--him I call a brahmin.

He who has no longings pertaining to this world or to the next, who is
desireless [for himself] and emancipated--him I call a brahmin.

He who has no longings, who, through knowledge, is free from doubts, who has
gained a firm footing in the Deathless (Nibbana)--him I call a brahmin.

Herein he who has transcended both good and evil, and the Ties [lust, hatred,
delusions, pride and false views] as well, who is sorrowless, stainless, and
pure--him I call a brahmin.

He who is spotless as the moon, who is pure, serene, and unperturbed, who has
destroyed craving for becoming--him I call a brahmin.

He who has passed beyond this quagmire which is difficult to cross, the ocean
of life (samsara), this delusion, who has crossed over and gone beyond; who is
meditative, free from craving and doubts; who, clinging to naught, has attained
Nibbana--him I call a brahmin.

The fearless, the noble, the hero, the great sage, the conqueror, the
desireless, the cleanser [of defilements], the enlightened--him I call a
brahmin.

Whoever in his self the Supreme Being has lodged,
His name is truly the servant of God:
On his vision has flashed the Lord that is also within the self.
This by utter humility has he obtained.
The servant who ever realizes the Lord to be near,
At the divine Portal finds acceptance.
By divine grace falling on His servant,
Comes to him full realization.
To be with all, yet in his self unattached--
Such a way, says Nanak, to God's servant is known.

One that the Lord's command in mind cherishes,
Is truly to be called Jivan-mukta (liberated while living).
To such a one are joy and sorrow alike;
Ever in joy, never feels he sorrow.
Gold and a clod of earth to him are alike,
As also nectar and foul-tasting poison.
To him are honor and dishonor alike;
Alike also pauper and prince.
One that such a way practices,
Says Nanak, a Jivan-mukta may be called.

attaining enlightenment through the path laid out by the Buddha.  Cf.

The servants of the All-merciful are those who walk in the earth modestly and
who, when the ignorant address them, say, "Peace;" who pass the night prostrate
to their Lord and standing; who say, "Our Lord, turn Thou from us the
chastisement of Gehenna; surely its chastisement is torment most terrible; evil
it is as a lodging place and an abode"; who, when they expend, are neither
prodigal nor parsimonious, but between that is a just stand; who call not upon
another god with God, nor slay the soul God has forbidden except by right,
neither fornicate....

And those who bear not false witness and, when they pass by idle talk, pass by
with dignity; who, when they are reminded of the signs of their Lord, fall not
down thereat deaf and blind; who say, "Our Lord, give us refreshment of our
wives and seed, and make us a model to the godfearing." Those shall be
recompensed with the highest heaven, for that they endured patiently, and they
shall receive therein a greeting and "Peace." Therein they shall dwell forever;
fair is it as a lodging place and an abode.

In order to know Shinto, the people must first be united with the mind of the
kami....  Whoever would serve the kami in worship must cast off his polluted
mind, and stand with pure, bright mind before the deity both morning and
evening, serving the kami warmly and with utmost propriety and awe, in order to
accord with the august mind of the divine.

With propriety never ending, the utmost in truth, without a single falsehood,
correct and rectified without a single error, pure and without a spot of
pollution, without selfish desires, and thus not greedy of personal gain, full
of love and affection.  Such is the mind of the kami.

With the foremost quality of truth, the mind of the divine is purity and
honesty.  Since this is so, the emperor, too, has been in accord with these
virtues since ancient times to the present.  Accordingly, the people as well
should follow the emperor's example of purity and honesty, making their own
minds earnest, meek, and gallant.

and 17.23-38.  Divine Injunctions: The Emperor of Japan has traditionally been
regarded as ikigami--a living god.  In life he is already manifesting the kami
nature, which ordinary people will manifest only after death.  Many of the
founders of the new religions in Japan are equally seen as ikigami.  Their
words and actions have inherent authority and ultimacy.  On the responsibility
of rulers to manifest the most perfect character, see Doctrine of the Mean 33,
p. 1034; Analects 12.19; Bhagavad Gita 3.20-21; Anguttara Nikaya ii.75, p.
1072; and related passages.

Mahamati, when the bodhisattvas face and perceive the happiness of the Samadhi
of perfect tranquilization, they are moved with the feeling of love and
sympathy owing to their original vows [made for the salvation of all beings,
saying, "So long as they do not attain Nirvana, I will not attain it myself"]
and they become aware of the part they are to perform as regards the
inexhaustible vows.  Thus, they do not enter Nirvana.  But the fact is that
they are already in Nirvana, because in them there is no rising of
discrimination. With them the discrimination of grasped and grasping no more
takes place; as they recognize that there is nothing in the world but what is
seen of the Mind itself, they have done away with the thought of discrimination
concerning all things.  They have abandoned adhering to and discriminating
based upon the faculties of cognition (citta), analysis (manas), and judgment
(manovijnana), and external objects, and self-nature.  However, they have not
given up the things promoting the cause of Buddhism.  Because of their
attachment to the inner insight which belongs to the stage of Tathagatahood,
whatever they do all issues from this transcendental knowledge.

What do I mean by a True Man?  The True Man of ancient times did not rebel
against want, did not grow proud in plenty, and did not plan his affairs. Being
like this, he could commit an error and not regret it, could meet with success
and not make a show.  Being like this, he could climb the high places and not
be frightened, could enter the water and not get wet, could enter the fire and
not get burned.  His knowledge was able to climb all the way up to the Way like
this.

The True Man of ancient times slept without dreaming and woke without care; he
ate without savoring and his breath came from deep inside. The True Man
breathes with his heels; the mass of men breathe with their throats. They,
crushed and bound down, gasp out their words as though they were retching.
Deep in their passions and desires, they are shallow in the workings of Heaven.

The True Man of ancient times knew nothing of loving life, knew nothing of
hating death.  He emerged without delight; he went back in without a fuss.  He
came briskly, he went briskly, and that was all.  He did not forget where he
began; he did not try to find out where he would end.  He received something
and took pleasure in it; he forgot about it and handed it back again.  This is
what I call not using the mind to repel the Way, not using man to help out
Heaven.  This is what I call the True Man.

Lankavatara Sutra 80: This describes the bodhisattva who has taken a vow not to
enter Nirvana until he has rescued all beings from suffering--cf.
Sikshasamuccaya 280-81, pp. 979f, and Garland Sutra 23, p. 980.  His attitude
is so totally without self that he is, according to this sutra, already in
Nirvana.  Thus Nirvana is a state of being that can be lived out in the world;
cf. Mulamadhyamaka Karika 25, pp. 91f;  Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti 2, p. 965.
