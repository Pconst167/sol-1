                             Degraded Human Nature
                                World Scripture

                             DEGRADED HUMAN NATURE

In previous chapters, we have gathered passages which testify to humanity's
true status as the highest sentient being; passages which describe the purity
and goodness of the original human nature; passages which describe the
perfection of human existence, filled with divine love and compassion.  Yet in
fact, most people exhibit a character that is more animal-like than divine.
Human nature has fallen far from the ideal of love and holiness which is
exalted by the world's religions.

Many people, influenced by the Darwinian theory of evolution, regard the animal
within human beings as an integral part of human nature, an inheritance from
our ape-like progenitors.  Indeed it is undeniable that the human being, by
virtue of having a body, possesses instinctive and animal-like appetites and
desires.  But the position of most religions is that the essence of the human
being is to be found in his spirit, which should dominate and control the body.
Perhaps the meaning of evolution is that humans are in the process of
transcending the animal stage and evolving to the point where the rational and
ethical sense will be dominant.

Thus, while human behavior often may be instinctual and low, it is not the
expression of the human essence.  It is rather a corruption of human nature and
a regression from realizing the true purpose of life.  In theistic religions,
such behavior is viewed as the result of humankind's separation from God.  A
degraded human being may be regarded as even lower than an animal, for at least
an animal strives to realize its limited purpose, while benighted humans stray
far from theirs.

The scripture passages gathered here approach this theme in three ways. Most
people have deviated from their original nature, their hearts having become
defiled and alienated from communion with God.  The accumulation of sinful
deeds, deluded thoughts, and base passions creates fetters that enslave those
who indulge in them.  Being thus degraded, they have sunk to the level of
beasts and even lower.

God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.

             1. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Ecclesiastes 7.29

Surely We created man of the best stature;
Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low,
Save those who believe and do good works,
and theirs is a reward unfailing.

                            2. Islam.  Qur'an 95.4-6

A little confusion can alter the sense of direction; a great confusion can
alter the inborn nature.

                            3. Taoism.  Chuang Tzu 8

4. Be not like those who forget God, and therefore He made them forget their
own souls!

                              Islam.  Qur'an 59.19

The effect of wrong belief is so dominant that the self does not evince its
inborn inclination to the real path, just as the invasion of a bile-infected
fever brings an aversion to sweet juice.

                      5. Jainism.  Nemichandra, Gomattasara

This consciousness (citta) is luminous, but it is defiled by adventitious
defilements.

                      6. Buddhism.  Anguttara Nikaya i.10

Delusion is a sort of demonic force.  People's original mind is pure but it
becomes perverted due to delusion and other karmas.

Satan said, "I will take of Thy servants a portion marked off; I will mislead
them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them... to deface
the fair nature created by God."  Whoever, forsaking God, takes Satan for a
friend, has of a surety suffered a loss that is manifest.  Satan makes them
promises, and creates in them false desires; but Satan's promises are nothing
but deception.

                           8. Islam.  Qur'an 4.118-20

Your mind, having become diseased and bewildered because of the false
sense-conceptions accumulated since beginningless time, has developed many
desires, attachments and habits.  From these there have arisen, incident to the
ever-changing processes of life, arbitrary conceptions concerning self and
not-self and as to what is true and what is not true. These arbitrary
conceptions have not developed in a normal way from your pure Mind Essence, but
in an abnormal way because of the prior false conceptions that had their origin
in the sense organs, like the sight of blossoms in the air that come to
diseased minds. They falsely appear to have had their origin in the
enlightening and Essential Mind but, in truth, they have arisen because of
diseased conditions.

                          9. Buddhism.  Surangama Sutra

Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save,
or His ear dull, that it cannot hear;
but your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God,
and your sins have hid His face from you so that He does not hear.

              10. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Isaiah 59.1-2

All vices are like chains thrown around the neck.

                  11. Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Sorath, M.1  p. 595

Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a
slave to sin."

                      12. Christianity.  Bible, John 8.34

Through wrong belief, indulgence, negligence, passions and activities the
individual self attracts particles of matter which are fit to turn into karma,
as the self is actuated by passions.  This influx of karma results in bondage.

Denizens of hell are bound by hate,
Hungry ghosts by misery,
And beasts by blindness.
Men by lust are bound,
By jealousy, asuras,
And the devas in heaven by pride.
These Six Fetters are the obstacles to liberation.

                            14. Buddhism.  Milarepa

Bound by the fetters of the fruits of good and evil, like a cripple; without
freedom, like a man in prison... thus they call him.

                      15. Hinduism.  Maitri Upanishad 4.2

The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can
understand it?

              16. Judaism and Christianity,  Bible, Jeremiah 17.9

Mencius said, "Slight is the difference between man and the brutes.  The common
man loses this distinguishing feature, while the gentleman retains it."

                       17. Confucianism.  Mencius IV.B.19

By doing evil the self becomes a rogue, an animal, or inhabitant of hell; and
always beset by thousands of pains, it strays incessantly.

                  18. Jainism.  Kundakunda, Pravacanasara 1.12

Having attained human birth, which is an open gateway to Brahman, one who...
remains attached to the ties of the world is not fit to be called human.
Pleasures of sense may be had in all lives: leave them, then, to the brutes!

                      19. Hinduism.  Srimad Bhagavatam 11.3

That man in whom there never kindles
One spark of the love of God,
Know, Nanak, that his earthly vesture
Is no better than that of a swine or dog!

Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
for the Lord has spoken:
"Sons I have reared and brought up,
but they have rebelled against me.
The ox knows its owner,
and the ass its master's crib;
but Israel does not know,
my people does not understand."

               21. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Isaiah 1.2-3

And recite to them the tiding of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he cast
them off, and Satan followed after him, and he became one of the perverts.  And
had We willed, We would have raised him up, but he inclined towards the earth
and followed his lust.  So the likeness of him is as the likeness of a dog; if
you attack it it lolls its tongue out, or if you leave it it lolls its tongue
out.  That is that people's likeness who cried lies to Our signs.  So relate
the story; haply they will reflect....

We have created for hell many jinn and men; they have hearts, but understand
not with them; they have eyes, but perceive not with them; they have ears, but
they hear not with them.  They are like cattle; nay, rather they are further
astray.  Those--they are the heedless.

                          22. Islam.  Qur'an 7.175-79

If man does worthily, they [i.e., God] say to him, "You were created before the
angels of the service"; if he does not, they say to him, "The fly, the gnat,
and the worm were created before you."

                      23. Judaism.  Midrash, Genesis Rabbah

Greed and evil are king and minister, falsehood their officer; Lust the
counselor who is called for advice--all three hold conclave to chalk out plans.
The subjects, bereft of understanding, are carcasses full of straw.
