                                   Moral Law
                                World Scripture

                                   MORAL LAW

Unlike the laws described by modern science, the immutable divine Law is
inherently moral, and is the basis for human ethics.  The Hindu concept of
Dharma, for example, embraces at once the cosmological, ethical, social, and
legal principles that provide the basis for belief in an ordered universe and
an ordered, prosperous society.  Religion, therefore, cannot easily accept the
modern distinction between fact and value: there are ethical values in human
life that are every bit as absolute as the fact that the earth revolves about
the sun.  The way to salvation lies in following the divine laws and revealed
teachings--e.g., the Tao (Taoism), the Torah (Judaism), the Reading (Islam),
the eternal Dharma (Hinduism and Sikhism), the Dhamma revealed by the Buddha,
or the Word revealed in the Gospel (Christianity).

The Law applies to all people, though not always equally.  Most religions,
including Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity, teach a single standard of law
that applies to all people.  In Hinduism, however, there are different dharmas
for people of different social status (varna), stage of life (ashrama), and
quality of inborn nature (guna), even though this differentiation should not
obscure an underlying unity in the divine principle.  Sometimes religions
distinguish between the law for believers and the law for unbelievers, for the
law of the community of believers is distinctive in that it is covenanted
(contracted) with God.  Regardless of this tendency to pluralism of laws, we
can discern an underlying common ground for the moral law--often called natural
law--which transcends religion or social circumstance.  This common ground will
be explored in the following sections on the Decalogue and the Golden Rule.

This section begins with passages urging people to follow the divine law or
holy teachings.  These laws are liberating.  They define the Way through which
a person sanctifies his life, according to Judaism.  They lay out the road to
heaven, according to Hinduism and Sikhism, or to Nirvana, according to
Buddhism.  They are the keys to happiness and success in life, as depicted
through the parables of the tree and the rock from the scriptures of
Christianity and Islam.

Law or Teaching is often an ambiguous concept, for there are laws that fetter
as well as teachings that liberate.  Christianity, for example, distinguishes
the Mosaic Law which educates but confines from the liberating grace available
through faith in Christ.  Works of law cannot save or liberate, according to
passages from the New Testament, the Upanishads, and the Buddhist scriptures.
Laws and doctrines are of provisional value, a concession to human sin,
according to a text from the Tao Te Ching.  These religions look beyond the
limitations of law to a higher relationship with the Absolute, what the
Christian calls justification by faith, the Hindu experiences as union with
Brahman, and the Buddhist experiences as Enlightenment.  The concluding
passages suggest this limitation of law and works done to fulfill the law.

Liberation comes from living the holy Word.

And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the
Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God
with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and
the statutes of the Lord, which I command you this day for your good?

God has revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent, [with
promises of reward] paired [with threats of punishment], at which creeps the
flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their hearts soften
to God's reminder.  Such is God's guidance, with which He guides whom He will.
And him whom God sends astray, for him there is no guide.

Because perfect wisdom tames and transforms him, wrath and conceit he does not
increase.  Neither enmity nor ill-will take hold of him, nor is there even a
tendency towards them.  He will be mindful and friendly....  It is wonderful
how this perfection of wisdom has been set up for the control and training of
the Bodhisattvas.

Have you not seen how God has struck a similitude?
A good word is as a good tree--
its roots are firm,
and its branches are in heaven;
it gives its produce every season
by the leave of its Lord.
So God strikes similitudes for men;
haply they will remember.
And the likeness of a corrupt word
is as a corrupt tree--
uprooted form the earth,
having no establishment.
God confirms those who believe with the firm word,
in the present life and in the world to come;
and God leads astray the evildoers;
and God does what He will.

Apply it to yourself and by its power you will be freed from dross.

Apply it to the village, and the village will be made secure.
Apply it to the kingdom, and the kingdom shall thereby be made to flourish.
Apply it to an empire, and the empire shall thereby be extended.

Why, is he better who founds his building upon the fear of God and His good
pleasure, or he who founds his building upon the brink of a crumbling bank that
will tumble with him into the fire of hell?  And God does not guide the people
of the evildoers.

The buildings they have built will not cease to be a point of doubt within
their hearts, until their hearts are cut to pieces; God is All-knowing,
All-wise.

Confucius remarked, "The life of the moral man is an exemplification of the
universal moral order (chung yung).  The life of the vulgar person, on the
other hand, is a contradiction of the universal moral order.

"The moral man's life is an exemplification of the universal order, because he
is a moral person who unceasingly cultivates his true self or moral being.  The
vulgar person's life is a contradiction of the universal order, because he is a
vulgar person who in his heart has no regard for, or fear of, the moral law."

The blessed Buddhas, of virtues endless and limitless, are born of the Law of
Righteousness; they dwell in the Law, are fashioned by the Law; they have the
Law as their master, the Law as their light, the Law as their field of action,
the Law as their refuge...

The Law is equal, equal for all beings.  For low or middle or high the Law
cares nothing.  So I must make my thought like the Law.

The Law has no regard for the pleasant.  Impartial is the Law.  So I must make
my thought like the Law....

The Law does not seek refuge.  The refuge of all the world is the Law.  So I
must make my thought like the Law.

The Law has none who can resist it.  Irresistible is the Law.  So I must make
my thought like the Law.

The Law has no preferences.  Without preference is the Law.  So I must make my
thought like the Law.

The Law has no fear of the terrors of birth-and-death, nor is it lured by
Nirvana.  Ever without misgiving is the Law.  So I must make my thought like
the Law.

Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the
law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held
accountable to God.  For no human being will be justified in his sight by works
of the law, since through the law comes knowledge of sin....

What then shall we say?  That the law is sin?  By no means!  Yet, if it had not
been for the law, I should not have known sin.  I should not have known what it
is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."  But sin, finding
opportunity in the commandment, wrought in me all kinds of covetousness.  Apart
from the law sin lies dead.  I was once alive apart from the law, but when the
commandment came, sin revived and I died; the very commandment which promised
life proved to be death to me.  For sin, finding opportunity in the
commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.

                25. Christianity.  Bible, Romans 3.19-20, 7.7-11

For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse, for it is written,
"Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of
the law, and do them."  Now it is evident that no man is justified before God
by the law; for "He who through faith is righteous shall live"; but the law
does not rest on faith, for "He who does them shall live by them."  Christ
redeemed us from the curse of the law....

Is the law then against the promises of God?  Certainly not; for if a law had
been given which could make alive, then righteousness would indeed be by the
law.  But the scripture consigned all things to sin, that what was promised to
faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

Now before faith came, we were confined under the law, kept under restraint
until faith should be revealed.  So that the law was our custodian until Christ
came, that we might be justified by faith.  But now that faith has come, we are
no longer under a custodian; for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God,
through faith.

Dharmasangiti Sutra: This is one sutra in a large Mahayana collection of sutras
called the Sikshasamuccaya.  Romans 3.19-20: The traditional Christian
evangelical purpose of the Old Testament (the Law) is to reveal the high
standards of godly behavior, and thereby to show people how sinful they are, to
elicit repentance, and thus to prepare them for the liberating word of the
Gospel.  But contrast Matthew 5.17-18, p. 662.  Romans 7.7-11: This passage
presents the psychological paradox that religious commandments often incite to
sin.  Furthermore the law, by making one conscious of moral obligations, may
lead to an oppressive sense of guilt.

Finite and transient are the fruits of sacrificial rites.  The deluded, who
regard them as the highest good, remain subject to birth and death.... Attached
to works, they know not God.  Works lead them only to heaven, whence, to their
sorrow, their rewards quickly exhausted, they are flung back to earth.
Considering religion to be observance of rituals and performance of acts of
charity, the deluded remain ignorant of the highest good.  Having enjoyed in
heaven the reward of their good works, they enter again into the world of
mortals.  But wise, self-controlled, and tranquil souls, who are contented in
spirit, and who practice austerity and meditation in solitude and silence, are
freed from all impurity, and attain by the path of liberation to the immortal,
the truly existing, the changeless Self.

                    27. Hinduism.  Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.7-11

People under delusion accumulate tainted merits but do not tread the Path.
They are under the impression that to accumulate merits and to tread the Path
are one and the same thing.
Though their merits for alms-giving and offerings are infinite.
They do not realize that the ultimate source of sin lies in the three poisons
within their own mind.

Galatians 3.10-13: The law becomes oppressive if interpreted in a
perfectionistic manner, as though one could not feel justified unless he kept
the law punctiliously to its smallest detail.  The grace of God in Jesus Christ
is a free unconditional gift; it is especially liberating to those who regard
the law as a burden which they cannot carry and feel oppressed by guilt for
violating it.  This of course does not mean that in Christ one can be
licentious; he should live in the Spirit of good works; cf. Galatians 5.19-23,
p. 465; James 2.14-26, p. 1009.  Galatians 3.21-26: The argument that
'scripture consigned all things to sin' refers to the fundamental human
condition of Original Sin--cf. Romans 3.9-12, p. 383--which persists regardless
of one's efforts to follow the law.  This sinful condition, the 'death' which
resulted from Adam's fall, is only redeemed by faith in Christ, who conquered
death; cf. 1 Corinthians 15.21-22, p. 547.  Mundaka Upanishad 1.2.7-11: Good
works, done to expiate evil karma produce merit according to the law of karma,
cannot help a person escape the wheel of rebirth.  Only through realizing
Brahman is there true liberation.  Sutra of Hui Neng 6: Good works done out of
a desire to earn a place in heaven are tainted by selfishness; hence they still
produce karma and cannot bring about liberation from bondage.  See the previous
note.

On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Uruvela, on the bank of
the river Neranjara at the foot of the Bodhi-tree, having just won the highest
wisdom.  He was seated for seven days in one posture and experienced the bliss
of release.  Then the Exalted One, after the lapse of those seven days, during
the first watch of the night, rousing himself from that concentration of mind,
gave close attention to causal uprising in direct order, thus,
     This being, that becomes; by the arising of this, that arises,
     namely: Conditioned by ignorance, activities; conditioned by
     activities, consciousness; conditioned by consciousness, mind and
     body; conditioned by mind and body, the six sense-spheres;
     conditioned by the six sense-spheres, contact; conditioned by
     contact, feeling; conditioned by feeling, craving; conditioned by
     craving, grasping; conditioned by grasping, becoming; conditioned by
     becoming, birth; conditioned by birth, old age and death, grief,
     lamentation, suffering, sorrow and despair come into being.  Thus is
     the arising of this mass of Ill.

The man of superior virtue is not conscious of his virtue,
And in this way he really possesses virtue.
The man of inferior virtue never loses sight of his virtue,
And in this way he loses his virtue....

Therefore, only when Tao is lost does the doctrine of virtue arise.
When virtue is lost, only then does the doctrine of humanity arise.
When humanity is lost, only then does the doctrine of righteousness arise.
When righteousness is lost, only then arise rules of propriety.
Now, propriety is a superficial expression of loyalty and faithfulness, and the
beginning of disorder.

Udana 1.1: This is a typical statement of Dependent Origination (Skt.
paticcasamuppada).  It is a law which describes the situation of human bondage;
cf. Surangama Sutra, p. 387.  In that sense it is comparable to the statements
by Paul that 'through the law comes knowledge of sin' (Romans 3.20 p. 163).
Yet only by a proper knowledge of ill can ill be overcome, by reversing the
chain of causation: 'If this is not, that does not come to be; from the
stopping of this, that is stopped'--Majjhima Nikaya ii.32, p. 548; cf. Samyutta
Nikaya xii.90, pp. 548f.  Garland Sutra 22: Mahayana Buddhism teaches that from
the vantage point of enlightenment, when all distinctions of subject and object
have been transcended, the laws of cause and effect and dependent origination
are themselves empty and unreal.  Concern with such laws are only provisional
teachings--see Mulamadhamaka Karika 24.8-12, pp. 1021f. Heart Sutra, pp. 589f.
