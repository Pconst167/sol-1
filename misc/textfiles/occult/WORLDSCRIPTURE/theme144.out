                                LOVE YOUR ENEMY
                                World Scripture

                                LOVE YOUR ENEMY

The prescription to love your enemy and to requite evil with good is sometimes
thought of as an impractical and perfectionist ethic, able to be practiced only
by a few exceptional souls.  But, in fact, this doctrine is widely taught in
all religions as a fundamental principle for pursuing relationships with
others.  The person who insists upon vengeance or retribution is not
necessarily committing a crime, but neither will his act of revenge be helpful
to spiritual advancement.  Revenge, which requites evil with evil, only
multiplies evil in the world, while love, by in which one strives to overcome
evil with good, spreads goodness in the world.

True love is unconditional and impartial--thus the metaphor of the sun that
shines down on all life.  It is tested and proven by encounters with those who
are difficult to love.  Where true love prevails, there no enemies are found.

The concluding passages dispute the prescription to love your enemy when it
apparently contravenes the principles of justice and right.  Sometimes the best
way to love an evil person is to make him face justice, or to hinder him from
doing wrong.  Nevertheless, these corrective actions should be done with a
loving heart and with the other person's welfare uppermost in mind.

"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me!"  In those who harbor
such thoughts hatred is not appeased.

"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me!"  In those who do not
harbor such thoughts hatred is appeased.

Hatreds never cease through hatred in this world; through love alone they
cease.  This is an eternal law.

You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your
enemy."  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute
you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his
sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the
unjust.  For if you love those who love you, what reward have you?  Do not even
the tax collectors do the same?  And if you salute only your brethren, what
more are you doing than others?  Do not even the Gentiles do the same?  You,
therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

My Lord!  Others have fallen back in showing compassion to their benefactors as
you have shown compassion even to your malefactors.  All this is unparalleled.

Of the adage, Only a good man knows how to like people, knows how to dislike
them, Confucius said, "He whose heart is in the smallest degree set upon
Goodness will dislike no one."

I should be like the sun, shining universally on all without seeking thanks or
reward, able to take care of all sentient beings even if they are bad, never
giving up on my vows on this account, not abandoning all sentient beings
because one sentient being is evil.

What kind of love is this that to another can shift? Says Nanak, True lovers
are those who are forever absorbed in the Beloved. Whoever discriminates
between treatment held good or bad, Is not a true lover--he rather is caught in
calculations.

                6.Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Asa-ki-Var, M.2, p. 474

The sage has no fixed [personal] ideas.
He regards the people's ideas as his own.
I treat those who are good with goodness,
And I also treat those who are not good with goodness.
Thus goodness is attained.

I am honest with those who are honest,
And I am also honest with those who are dishonest.
Thus honesty is attained.

It may be that God will ordain love between you and those whom you hold as
enemies.  For God has power over all things; and God is Oft-forgiving, Most
Merciful.

The good deed and the evil deed are not alike.  Repel the evil deed with one
which is better, then lo!, he between whom and you there was enmity shall
become as though he were a bosom friend.

But none is granted it save those who are steadfast, and none is granted it
save a person of great good fortune.

A superior being does not render evil for evil; this is a maxim one should
observe; the ornament of virtuous persons is their conduct.  One should never
harm the wicked or the good or even criminals meriting death.  A noble soul
will ever exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or
those of cruel deeds when they are actually committing them--for who is without
fault?

                    17.Hinduism.  Ramayana, Yuddha Kanda 115

The reason why God does not punish even though He may see an enemy and have the
urge to kill him and get revenge, is that He is thinking of the enemy's
parents, wife and children who all love.  Knowing all too well their
unparalleled love toward that person, God cannot strike him with His iron rod.
When you really understand such a heart of God, could you take revenge on your
enemy?  When you know all these things, you would even go and help that person.
In this manner one comes closer to the Great Way of heavenly Principle, that
Great Way which tries to embrace everything centering on love.  When this
happens earth will shake and induce even God to shed tears.  "You truly
resemble me.  How happy I am!"  He will ex- claim.  God always looks at things
in that perspective.  This is how we should understand the teaching to love
one's enemy.  The source of such a power to love your enemy is neither
knowledge, nor money, nor earthly power.  It is only true love.

Someone said, "What do you say concerning the principle that injury should be
recompensed with kindness?"  The Master said, "With what will you then
recompense kindness?  Recompense injury with justice, and recompense kindness
with kindness."

                        19.Confucianism.  Analects 14.36

According to Anas ibn Malik, the Prophet said, "Help your brother whether he is
oppressor or oppressed."

According to Anas, after the Messenger of God said, "Help your brother whether
he is oppressor or oppressed," Anas replied to him, "O Messenger of God, a man
who is oppressed I am ready to help, but how does one help an oppressor?"  "By
hindering him doing wrong," he said.

Ramayana: Cf. Yajur Veda 36.18, p. 210.  Sun Myung Moon, 3-30-90: See Sun Myung
Moon, 10-20-73, pp. 850f.  Analects 14.36: This and the following passage
dispute the notion that to love your enemy always means to do kindness, if that
would not uphold justice.  Confucius is here disputing the proverb from the Tao
Te Ching 63, quoted above.  Yet Confucius also praises the ideal of universal
benevolence in Analects 4.3-4, above. Apparently, even though a man may like an
evildoer and want to help him, sometimes doing him a kindness will not be
helpful; particularly if that 'kindness' only encourages him to do more evil.
Tougher measures may be appropriate, but these, too, should be motivated by
genuine love--by a parental concern for the wrongdoer's welfare.  See also
