                                Husband And Wife
                                World Scripture

                                HUSBAND AND WIFE

The horizontal axis of family life is manifested primarily in the mutual love
between husband and wife.  The bond of marriage is regarded as divinely
ordained in most religious traditions.  As such, it carries with it the promise
of God's blessing, and should be full of love and joy.

But love is not merely a matter of unfettered emotion. Subsequent passages
spell out some of the responsibilities of marriage for both the husband and
wife.  The husband should honor his wife, never oppress or mistreat her, and
always be faithful--and the wife should do likewise.  The scriptures of all
religions also distinguish between roles of the husband and wife: the husband
protects and supports his wife, the head of the household yet deferring to his
wife in domestic affairs.  The wife is obedient to her husband, serves him with
kindness, and takes primary responsibility for raising the children.  While of
late these traditional roles have been questioned, they have served to
strengthen the bonds of family through every generation.  Finally, we include
several passages on the subject of the good wife.

Not those are true husband and wife that with each other [merely] consort:
Truly wedded are those that in two frames, are as one light.

I am He, you are She;
I am Song, you are Verse,
I am Heaven, you are Earth.
We two shall here together dwell,
becoming parents of children.

                       2. Hinduism.  Atharva Veda 14.2.71

Sweet be the glances we exchange,
our faces showing true concord.
Enshrine me in your heart and let
one spirit dwell within us.

I wrap around you this my robe
which came to me from Manu,
so that you may be wholly mine
and never seek another.

Representing heaven and earth, I have created husband and wife.  This is the
beginning of the world.

                           4. Tenrikyo.  Mikagura-uta

In the beginning there was only the Self, one only.  He desired, "May I have a
wife in order to have offspring; may I have wealth in order to perform a
work!"--for desire reaches this far.  Even if one wishes, one cannot obtain
more than this.  As long as one does not attain each of these [desires], he
thinks himself to be incomplete.

He found no joy; so even today, one who is all alone finds no joy.  He yearned
for a second.  He became as large as a man and a woman locked in close embrace.
This self he split into two; hence arose husband and wife.  Therefore, as
Yajnavalkya used to observe, "Oneself is like half of a split pea." That is why
this void is filled by woman.  He was united with her, and thence were born
human beings.

            5. Hinduism.  Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.17 and 1.4.3

Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will
make him a helper fit for him."  So out of the ground the Lord God formed every
beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to
see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature,
that was its name.  The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the
air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a
helper fit for him.  So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man,
and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and
the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and
brought her to the man.  Then the man said,  "This at last is bone of my bones
and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
Man."  Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his
wife, and they become one flesh.

The verse, "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent" (Genesis
24.67), our masters have interpreted to mean that the Divine Presence came into
Isaac's house along with Rebecca.  According to the secret doctrine, the
supernal Mother is together with the male only when the house is in readiness
and at the time the male and female are conjoined. At such time blessings are
showered forth by the supernal Mother upon them.

The point at which Adam and Eve join into one body as husband and wife is also
the point at which God, the subject of love, and man, the object of beauty,
become one union, thus establishing the center of goodness. Here, for the first
time, the purpose of creation is accomplished.  God, our Parent, is able to
abide with perfected men as His children, and peacefully rest for eternity. At
that time, this center would become the object of God's eternal love, and
through this, God would be stimulated with happiness for eternity.  Here God's
Word would be physically incarnated for the first time in human history....
However, the universe lost this center when man fell.

Doctrine of the Mean 12:  Cf. I Ching 54, p. 123.  Divine Principle I.1.2.3.4:
The Blessing, or holy wedding, is the chief sacrament in the Unification
Church.  Blessed marriages are for eternity.  Cf. Divine Principle I.2.2.2, p.
429.  Ketubot 8a: These six benedictions are recited at the wedding ceremony.
The 'building' refers to the creation of Eve from Adam's rib, as well as the
household of the family.  The reference to God as the Creator of humankind
denotes that marriage is God's design for the perpetuation of the human race,
which began with the blessing to Adam and Eve in Eden.  The last benediction
connects the joy of the newlyweds with the eschatological joy at the
fulfillment of God's kingdom in Jerusalem.  Bridal 'canopies' are used at all
Jewish weddings.

And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my
law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and is sealed unto them by the
Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this
power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them--Ye shall
come forth in the first resurrection... and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms,
principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths--then shall it be

Book of Songs, Ode 1: This ode begins by describing a lover's anxiety as he
awaits his bride, and ends with the joy of friends and family at their wedding.
Many interpret the ode as describing the virtue of a bride of King Wen, as
shown by her modest disposition and retiring manner.  The king's anxiety and
long quest to obtain his bride is often remarked.  The sound of male and female
ospreys answering each other at a distance alludes to the distance between the
lovers; the soft duckweed gathered and presented as an offering alludes to
their union.  Confucius cites this ode, see Analects 3.20, p. 921, as a model
of restrained pleasure, of joy not carried to extremes. Cf. Song of Solomon
3:1-5, pp. 763f.

Kaen-kwan went the axle ends of my carriage,
As I thought of the young beauty, and went to fetch her.
It was not that I was hungry or thirsty,
But I longed for one of such virtuous fame to come and be with me.

Dense is that forest in the plain,
And there sit the long-tailed pheasants.
In her proper season that well-grown lady,
With her admirable virtue, is come to instruct me.
We will feast, and I will praise her.

Although I have no good spirits,
We will drink, and perhaps be satisfied.
Although I have no good viands,
We will eat, and perhaps be satisfied.
Although I have no virtue to impart to you,
We will sing and dance.

I ascend that lofty ridge,
And split the branches of the oaks for firewood.
I split the branches of the oaks for firewood
Amid the luxuriance of their leaves.
I see you whose match is seldom to be seen,
And my whole heart is satisfied.

The high hill is seen above;
The great road is easy to travel,
My four steeds advanced without stopping;
The six reins [make music] in my hands like lute-strings.
I see you, my bride,
To the comfort of my heart.

I bind you together to a common yoke.
United, gather round the sacrificial fire

like the gods who preserve their immortality.
Morn and eve may there be the loving heart in you.

It is well for a man not to touch a woman.  But because of the temptation to
immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife
to her husband.  For the wife does not rule over her own body, but the husband
does; likewise the husband does not rule over his body, but the wife does.  Do
not refuse one another except perhaps by agreement for a season, that you may
devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, lest Satan tempt you
through lack of self-control.  I say this by way of concession, not of
command....

clothing, but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable
jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.  So

submissive to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord.  And
you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.

Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ.  Wives, be subject to
your husbands, as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of the wife as
Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.  As the
church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to
their husbands.  Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her, the he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the
washing of water with the word, that he might present the church to himself in
splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and
without blemish.  Even so husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.
He who loves his wife loves himself.  For no man ever hates his own flesh, but
nourishes it and cherishes it, as Christ does the church, because we are
members of his body.  "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother
and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."  This mystery
is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church;
however, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see
that she respects her husband.

The husband who wedded her with sacred texts always gives happiness to his
wife, both in season or out of season.

Though he may be destitute of virtue, or seek his pleasure elsewhere, or devoid
of good qualities, yet a husband must be constantly revered as a god by a
faithful wife.

Women need perform no sacrifice, no vow, no fast; if she obeys her husband, she
will for that reason alone be exalted in heaven.

A faithful wife, who desires to dwell after death with her husband, must never
do anything that might displease him who took her hand, whether he be alive or
dead....

She who, controlling her thoughts, words, and deeds, never slights her lord,
resides after death with her husband in heaven, and is called a virtuous wife.

Sujata, the young wife of an eldest son of a rich merchant, Anathapindika, was
arrogant, did not respect others and did not listen to the instruction of her
husband and his parents.  Consequently, some discord arose in the family. One
day the Blessed One came to visit Anathapindika and noticed this state of
affairs.  He called the young wife, Sujata, to Him and spoke to her kindly,
saying,  "Sujata, there are seven types of wives:

A wife who is pitiless, corrupt in mind,
Neglecting husband and unamiable,
Inflamed by other men, a prostitute bent on murder,
Call that wife a slayer!

A wife who would rob her husband of his gains--
Though little be the profit that he makes,
Whether by craftsmanship, or from his trade, or by the plough--
Call that wife a robber!

The slothful glutton, bent on doing nothing,
A gossip and a shrew with strident voice,
Who brings to low account her husband's zeal and industry--
Call that wife a master!

Who with loving sympathy,
Just as a mother for her only son,
For husband cares, and over his stored-up wealth keeps watch and ward--
Call that wife a mother!

Who holds her husband in the same regard
As younger sister holds the elder born,
The meek in heart, who in his every wish her husband serves--
Call that wife a sister!

And she who is as glad her lord to see
As boon companions long apart to meet,
A gracious character of gentle birth, a fond helpmate--
Call that wife a friend!

If fearless of the lash and stick, unmoved,
All things enduring, calm, and pure in heart,
She bear obedience to her husband's word, from anger free--
Call that wife a handmaid!

Now she who's called: a mistress, slayer, thief,
Who's harsh, immoral, lacking in respect, when death comes--
Will wander in the miseries of hell.

But mother, sister or companion, slave,
In precept long established and restrained, when death comes--
Will wander in the happy heaven world.

These, Sujata, are the seven kinds of wives a man may have; and which of them
are you?"

"Lord," said Sujata, "let the Exalted One think of me as a handmaid from this
day forth."

She gathers the white southernwood,
By the ponds, on the islets.
She employs it,
In the business of our prince.

She gathers the white southernwood,
Along the streams in the valleys.
She employs it,
In the temple of our prince.

With headdress reverently rising aloft,
Early, while yet it is night, she is in the prince's temple.
In her headdress, slowly retiring,
She returns [to her own apartments].

Book of Songs, Ode 13: This song praising the dutiful wife may be describing
how she gathers wood for nurturing silkworms.  But the word 'temple,' although
it could mean any large public building, rather suggests that she is engaged in
religious duties at a royal shrine. Chinese moralists have long referred to
this piece to show how even the most trivial things are accepted in sacrifice,
when presented with reverence and sincerity.

A good wife who can find?
She is far more precious than jewels.
The heart of her husband trusts in her,
and he will have no lack of gain.
She does him good, and not harm,
all the days of her life.
She seeks wool and flax,
and works with willing hands.
She is like the ships of the merchant,
she brings her food from afar.
She rises while it is yet night
and provides food for her household
and tasks for her maidens.
She considers a field and buys it;
with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.
She girds her loins with strength
and makes her arms strong.
She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.
Her lamp does not go out at night.
She puts her hands to the distaff,
and her hands hold the spindle...

She opens her mouth with wisdom,
and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.
She looks well to the ways of her household,
and does not eat the bread of idleness.
Her children rise up and call her blessed;
her husband also, and he praises her,
"Many women have done excellently,
but you surpass them all."
Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain,
but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
Give her of the fruit of her hands,
and let her works praise her in the gates.
