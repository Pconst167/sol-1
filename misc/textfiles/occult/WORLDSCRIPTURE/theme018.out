                               Joy and Happiness
                                World Scripture

                               JOY AND HAPPINESS

The search for happiness is basic to human life, and to the purpose of religion
as well.  This first section brings together passages dealing with the
religious experience of transcendental joy through union with Ultimate Reality
or the realization of one's true mind.  This state may be characterized as
bliss (Skt. ananda) or Nirvana; it is a reality beyond any suffering.
Scriptures of all religions depict and extol the ultimate goal of the religious
journey as a state of intoxicating joy.

The section opens with passages which extol the bliss which is the final goal
of the spiritual life.  A second group of passages assert how heavenly joys are
in every way superior to mundane pleasures, and then various degrees of
happiness are discerned, depending upon the level of one's spiritual awareness.
The highest level is attained only with the complete cessation of self-centered
desires and denial of self in relation to the Absolute.  The last group of
passages recommend that one live in a state of contentment, joy, and praise,
even as one pursues the path to ultimate bliss; a heart filled with bliss is
itself a prerequisite for realizing higher, more refined states of divine
happiness.

Thou dost show me the path of life; in Thy presence there is fulness of joy, in
Thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.

                1. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Psalm 16.11

No person knows what delights of the eye are kept hidden for them--as a reward
for their good deeds.

                            2. Islam.  Qur'an 32.17

No eye has seen, nor ear heard,
nor the heart of man conceived,
what God has prepared for those who love Him.

                   3. Christianity.  Bible, 1 Corinthians 2.9

I created you human beings because I desired to see you lead a joyous life.

                          4. Tenrikyo.  Ofudesaki 14.25

Those who believe, and whose hearts find satisfaction in the remembrance of
God: for without doubt, in the remembrance of God do hearts find satisfaction.

For those who believe and work righteousness, is blessedness, and a beautiful
place of return.

                           5. Islam.  Qur'an 13.28-29

The soul which is free from the defect of karma gets to the highest point of
the universe, knows all and perceives all, and obtains the transcendental bliss
everlasting.

                    6. Jainism.  Kundakunda, Pancastikaya 170

And may the sovereign Good be ours!
According as one desires bliss may one receive bliss
Through Thy most far-seeing Spirit, O Lord,
The wonders of the Good Mind which Thou wilt give as righteousness,
With the joy of long life all the days!

                     7. Zoroastrianism.  Avesta, Yasna 43.2

Lao Tan said, "I was letting my mind wander in the beginning of things."

"What does this mean?" asked Confucius.

Lao Tan said, "It means to attain Perfect Beauty and wander in Perfect
Happiness.  He who attains Perfect Beauty and wanders in Perfect Happiness may
be called the Perfect Man."

                            8. Taoism  Chuang Tzu 21

At any one moment, Nirvana has neither the phenomenon of becoming, nor that of
cessation, nor even the ceasing of operation of becoming and cessation. It is
the manifestation of perfect rest and cessation of changes, but at the time of
manifestation there is not even a concept of manifestation; so it is called the
Everlasting Joy which has neither enjoyer nor non-enjoyer.

                        9. Buddhism.  Sutra of Hui Neng 7

There is no limit to joy.  Happiness has no end.  When you are standing in the
love of God, every cell in your body jumps for joy.  You breathe in and out
with the entire universe.  In this state, your life is fulfilled.  This is how
God means us to live, intoxicated in love and joy.  And through our joy, God
receives His joy.  The joy of man is the joy of God; and the joy of God is the
joy of man.

In spontaneous joy is rising the mystic melody;
In the holy Word my heart feels joy and perpetually disports.
In the cave of spontaneous realization is it in trance,
Stationed on a splendid high cushion.

After wandering to my home [true self] have I returned,
And all of my desires have obtained.
Devotees of God!  completely fulfilled is my self,
As the Master has granted a vision of the Supreme Being,
realized by mystic illumination.

Himself is He King, Himself the multitude;
Himself the supremely liberated, Himself of joys the Relisher;
With Him seated on the throne of eternal justice,
ended is all wailing and crying.
As I have seen, such vision of Him have I conveyed--
Only those who are initiated into this mystery have its joy.
As light is merged into Divine Light, has joy come:
Nanak, servant of God, has beheld the sole, all-pervading Supreme Being.

                   11. Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Majh, M.5, p. 97

When totally free from outer contacts
a man finds happiness in himself,
He is fully trained in God's discipline
and reaches unending bliss.
The experiences we owe to our sense of touch
are only sources of unpleasantness.
They have a beginning and an end.
A wise man takes no pleasure in them.
That man is disciplined and happy
who can prevail over the turmoil
That springs from desire and anger,
here on earth, before he leaves his body.

                      15. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 5.21-23

Diseases have hunger as their worst.  Sufferings have dispositions as their
worst.  Knowing this in proper perspective, freedom (Nibb-ana) is the ultimate
happiness.

Of all gains, good health is the greatest.  Of all wealth, contentment is the
greatest.  Among kinsmen, the trusty is the greatest.  Freedom (Nibb-ana) is
the ultimate happiness.

Having imbibed the essence of solitude and the essence of tranquillity, and
imbibing the joyous essence of righteousness, one becomes free from anguish and
free from evil.

                        16. Buddhism.  Dhammapada 203-05

The bliss of lusts and heaven-world equal not One sixteenth of the bliss of
craving's ending.

                            17. Buddhism.  Udana 11

The felicity that results from the gratification of desire, or that other purer
felicity which one enjoys in heaven, does not come to even a sixteenth part of
that which arises upon the abandonment of all kinds of thirst!

                  18. Hinduism.  Mahabharata, Shantiparva 177

God has promised to believers... beautiful mansions in Gardens of everlasting
bliss.  But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of God: that is the supreme
felicity.

                            19. Islam.  Qur'an 9.72

Upanishad 4.4.6-7, p. 927; Dhammapada 89, p. 225.  Dhammapada 203-05: The joy
of right concentration is also mentioned as the final stage in the Noble
Eightfold Path in Majjhima Nikaya iii.251-52, p. 170.  This is ecstasy, which,
as the word literally indicates, means to turn from the old center--whether
selfishness or a dependence on the illusory or temporal--to a new and ultimate
center.  Cf. Anguttara Nikaya iii.34, p. 531; Sutra 21, p. 205.  Udana 11: Cf.

From Joy there is some bliss, from Perfect Joy yet more, from the Joy of
cessation comes a passionless state, and the Joy of the Innate is finality. The
first comes by desire for contact, the second by desire for bliss, the third
from the passing of passion, and by this means the fourth is realized.

                      20. Buddhism.  Hevajra Tantra 8.32-33

The Self-existent is the essence of all felicity... Who could live, who could
breathe, if that blissful Self dwelt not within the lotus of the heart? He it
is that gives joy.

Of what is the nature of joy?

Consider the lot of a young man, noble, well-read, intelligent, strong,
healthy, with all the wealth of the world at his command.  Assume that he is
happy, and measure his joy as one unit.

One hundred times that joy is one unit of the gandharvas; but no less joy than
gandharvas has the seer to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without
craving.

One hundred times the joy of the gandharvas is one unit of the joy of celestial
gandharvas [angels]; but no less joy than the celestial gandharvas has the sage
to whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.

One hundred times the joy of the celestial gandharvas is one unit of the joy of
the pitris in their paradise... joy of the devas... joy of the devas born out
of sacrifice... joy of the ruling devas... joy of Indra... joy of Brihaspati...
joy of Prajapati... joy of Brahma, but no less joy than Brahma has the seer to
whom the Self has been revealed, and who is without craving.

It is written: He who knows the joy of Brahman, which words cannot express and
the mind cannot reach, is free from fear.  He is not distressed by the thought,
"Why did I not do what is right?  Why did I do what is wrong?"  He who knows
the joy of Brahman, knowing both good and evil, transcends them both.

                    21. Hinduism.  Taittiriya Upanishad 2.7-9

Life is art.
The whole life of man is Self-Expression.
The individual is an expression of God.
We suffer if we do not express ourselves.

The Holy Spirit rests on him only who has a joyous heart.

Rabbi Baruqa of Huza often went to the marketplace at Lapet.  One day, the
prophet Elijah appeared to him there, and Rabbi Baruqa asked him, "Is there
anyone among all these people who will have a share in the World to Come?"
Elijah answered, "There is none."  Later, two men came to the marketplace, and
Elijah said to Rabbi Baruqa, "Those two will have a share in the World to
Come!"  Rabbi Baruqa asked the newcomers, "What is your occupation?" They
replied, "We are clowns.  When we see someone who is sad, we cheer him up. When
we see two people quarreling, we try to make peace between them."

Only by obtaining happiness does one act.

Mother mine! Bliss have I attained in union with the Divine Master:
Spontaneously has union with the Divine Master come about--
In my mind resounds joyous music.
Fairies of the family of jewel harmony have descended to sing holy songs;
Sing all ye the Lord's song, who have lodged it in heart!
Says Nanak, Bliss have I attained on union with the Divine Master.

Let us live happily, without yearning for sensual pleasures amongst those who

Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the lands!
Serve the Lord with gladness!
Come into his presence with singing!
Know that the Lord is God!
It is he that made us, and we are his;
we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter his gates with thanksgiving,
and his courts with praise!
Give thanks to him, bless his name!
For the Lord is good;
his steadfast love endures forever,
and his faithfulness to all generations.
