                              The Kingdom of Heaven
                                World Scripture

                             THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN

The hope for the advent of the millennium, an ideal world, a world without
evil, a world in which God's sovereignty is fully manifest, is present to some
degree in every world religion.  However, this hope is most strongly expressed
in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (and the new religions which show their
influence), where it is not only a hope but the firm promise of God.  Sometimes
the term Kingdom of Heaven denotes a spiritual ideal, a state of bliss beyond
death: see Heaven, pp. 352-61; but that sense of the term does not do justice
to the most thoroughgoing eschatological visions.  We are concerned in this
chapter with the hope of an ideal future that is to be realized in this world.
Furthermore, calling this ideal the Kingdom of Heaven is not meant to connote
that its political system should be a monarchy; rather, it is God who will
reign on earth through the hearts of godly people.

This section assembles passages which regard the Kingdom of Heaven from several
vantage points.  First, it is a world of God's absolute sovereignty; His will
alone will be exalted.  Righteousness, peace, prosperity, and joy will prevail,
gladdening all humanity.  Second, human beings will be perfected in character,
knowing intimately the heart and will of God and rejoicing in the practice of
the heavenly way.  They will have no inward impediments to doing good.  Third,
death will be no more, or the dead will return in a general resurrection.
Fourth, the Kingdom of Heaven will be an ideal community, symbolized by Zion,
the Holy City, the New Jerusalem.  Finally, we offer passages from several new
religions which connect the dawning of this ideal world with the progress of
human civilization in this century.

The sovereignty on that day will be God's.  He will judge between them.

                            1. Islam.  Qur'an 22.56

The Lord will become king over all the earth; on that day the Lord will be one
and His name one.

                  2. Judaism and Christianity.  Zechariah 14.9

The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven,
saying, "The kingdom of this world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of
his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever."

                       3. Christianity.  Revelation 11.15

All Israel shall have part in the World to Come, as it is said, "And the people
shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land forever, the branch of my
planting, the work of my hands that I may be glorified" [Isaiah 60.21].

                      4. Judaism.  Mishnah, Sanhedrin 11.1

On the day when We shall roll up heaven as a scroll is rolled for the writings;
as We originated the first creation, so We shall bring it back again--a promise
binding on Us; so We shall do.  For We have written in the Psalms, after the
Remembrance, "The earth shall be the inheritance of My righteous servants."

                            5. Islam.  Qur'an 21.104

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall
       be satisfied.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is
        the kingdom of Heaven.

We therefore hope in Thee, O Lord our God, that we shall soon behold the
triumph of Thy might, idolatry will be uprooted from the earth, and falsehood
be utterly destroyed.

We hope for the day when the world will be perfected under the dominion of the
Almighty and all mankind learn to revere Thy name; when all the wicked of the
earth will be drawn in penitence unto Thee.

O may all the inhabitants of the world recognize that unto Thee every knee must
bend, every tongue pledge loyalty.  Before Thee, O Lord our God, may they bow
in worship, and give honor to Thy glorious name.

May they all acknowledge Thy kingdom, and may Thy dominion be established over
them speedily and forevermore.  For sovereignty is Thine, and to all eternity
Thou wilt reign in glory.

If kings and barons would but possess themselves of [Tao],
The ten thousand creatures would flock to do them homage;
Heaven and earth would conspire
To send Sweet Dew.
Without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony ....
To Tao all under heaven will come
As streams and torrents flow into a great river or sea.

                          8. Taoism.  Tao Te Ching 32

It shall come to pass in the latter days
       that the mountain of the house of the Lord
shall be established as the highest of the mountains,
       and shall be raised above the hills;
And all the nations shall flow to it;
       and many peoples shall come, saying,
"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
       to the house of the God of Jacob;
That he may teach us his ways
       and that we may walk in his paths."
For out of Zion shall go forth the law,
       and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
He shall judge between the nations,
       and shall decide for many peoples;
They shall beat their swords into ploughshares,
       and their spears into pruning hooks;
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
       neither shall they learn war any more.

Some persons asked the Prophet, "Shall we see God on the day of resurrection?"
He answered, "Do you feel any trouble in seeing the moon on the night when it
is full?  Do you feel any trouble in seeing the sun on a cloudless day?"  They
answered, No.  He said, "In the same way you will see your Lord."

                          15. Islam.  Hadith of Muslim

For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect; but when the
perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.  When I was a child, I spoke like
a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man,
I gave up childish ways.  For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to
face.  Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully.

                    16. Christianity.  1 Corinthians 13.9-12

While the living see, at the kalpa's end,
The conflagration in its burning,
Tranquil remains this realm of mine,
Ever full of gods and men,
Parks and many palaces,
With every sort of gem adorned,
Blooming and fruitful jewel trees,
Where all creatures pleasure take;
The gods strike up their heavenly drums
And music make for evermore,
Showering down celestial flowers
On Buddha and his mighty host.

My Pure Land is not destroyed,
Though all view it as being burned up,
And grief and horror and distress
Thus fill them to the full.
Those creatures, full of sin
By reason of their evil karma,
Throughout kalpas numberless hear not
The name of the most Precious Three.
But those who virtuous deeds shall do,
Are gentle and of upright nature,
These will ever me behold
Here expounding to all the Law.

                          17. Buddhism.  Lotus Sutra 16

"Be holy unto your God" [Numbers 15.40].  As long as you execute the
commandments, you are sanctified, but if you separate yourself from the
commandments, you are profaned.  And God says, "In this world the evil
inclination [within every person's heart] separates you from the commandments,
but in the world to come I will root it out from you, as it is said, 'I will
put my Spirit within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your
flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit within
you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and do them' [Ezekiel 36.26-27]."

Sanhedrin 99a: The variety of conceptions about the World to Come in Judaism is
evidenced by comparing this conservative statement by Rab Samuel with some of
the others in this section which speculate on more radical transformations.
Genesis Rabbah 10.4: The remedy of Torah has already healed the Jews of any
injury from Adam's sin--see Tanhuma, below; Shabbat 145b-146a, p. 476; but
ultimately the entire world must be healed. Cf. 1 Corinthians 15.21-22, p. 476.
1 John 3.2: That is, we shall all become perfect and Christ-like at the Second
Coming of Christ.  Thomas Aquinas described this Beatific Vision as "the
ultimate goal for the redeemed."  Cf. Romans 8.22-23, pp. 278-79; 2 Corinthians
3.18, p. 507. Hadith of Muslim: Cf. Berakot 17a, p. 305; Job 19.25-26, p. 507.
1 Corinthians 13.9-12: We can expect to gain clearer understanding of truth
that can guide us about life in the Kingdom of Heaven.  Cf. John 16.12-13, p.
699; Book of Certitude, 33-41, pp. 932f; Divine Principle I.3.5.2, p. 933.
Lotus Sutra 16: In keeping with the Hindu theory of cycles of cosmic time, 'the
kalpa's end' is not a final consummation but rather the end of an age.
Although the entire phenomenal world is apparently consumed in the
conflagration, for those with eyes to see, the Buddha's Pure Land remains
unharmed.  The Buddha's nature is eternal, and likewise the natures of those
who realize their own Buddha nature.

When God appears, there is goodness, there is justice, there is benevolence,
harmony comes of itself, all creatures find their places, and there is not
conflict, no preying on each other, no disease, no suffering, no poverty.

Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new  covenant
with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I
made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the
land of Egypt, my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband, says
the Lord.  But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel
after those days, says the Lord: I will put my law within them, and I will
write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be my
people.  And no longer shall each man teach his neighbor and each his brother,
saying, "Know the Lord," for they shall all know me, from the least of them to
the greatest, says the Lord; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will
remember their sin no more.

                        20. Judaism.  Jeremiah 31.31-34

In the Kali age, men will be afflicted by old age, disease, and hunger, and
from sorrow there will arise depression, indifference, deep thought,
enlightenment, and virtuous behavior.  Then the age will change, deluding their
minds like a dream, by the force of fate, and when the Golden Age begins, those
left over from the Kali age will be the progenitors of the Golden Age.  All
four classes will survive as a seed, together with those born in the Golden
age, and the seven sages will teach them all dharma. Thus there is eternal
continuity from age to age.

Nectarean Shower of Holy Doctrines: This passage reflects the millenarian hopes
in popular Japanese religion, and is given concrete expression in many of the
new religions.  Cf. Johrei, below.  Jeremiah 31.31-34: Christianity regards
this prophecy as having been fulfilled with the coming of Jesus Christ, who
inaugurated a 'New Covenant'--see 1 Corinthians 11.23-25, p. 735; 2 Corinthians
3.6, p. 697; Galatians 3.21-26, p. 151--from which we get the term New
Testament.  But the perfect knowledge of God and His law, which would be the
full realization of this prophecy, awaits the eschatological future.  Cf. Sun
Myung Moon, 10-20-73, pp. 850f.  Linga Purana 1.40: Here the sufferings of the
old age beget a process which leads to enlightenment and transfiguration of the
age.  The 'seven sages' are the traditional teachers of the Veda.  Yet the
continuity between the ages is required because of the continual operation of
the law of karma; the caste system, too, which is a result of karma, also will
persist.  The image of the survivors as a seed recurs in Vishnu Purana 4.24, p.
942.  See also Laws of Manu 1.81-86, p. 377.

They will practice these virtues: abstain from taking life, abstain from taking
what is not given, abstain from adultery, abstain from lying, abstain from evil
speaking, abstain from abuse and from idle talk, abstain from covetousness,
from ill will, from false opinions, abstain from the three things--incest,
wanton greed, and perverted desires--be filial towards their mothers and
fathers, be pious toward holy men, and respect heads of clans.  And because of
the good they do they will increase in length of life, and in comeliness, so
that the sons of them who lived but forty years will come to live eighty years;
their sons to 160 years; their sons to 320 years; their sons to 640 years...
2,000 years... 4,000 years... 8,000 years... 20,000 years... 40,000 years; and
the sons of those that lived 40,000 years will come to live 80,000 years.

Among such humans there will be only three kinds of disease: appetite,
non-assimilation, and old age.  Among such humans, this world will be mighty
and prosperous, the villages, towns, and royal cities will be so close that a
cock could fly from each one to the next.  Among such humans this India--one
might think it a Waveless Deep--will be pervaded by mankind even as a jungle is
by reeds and rushes.

      22. Buddhism.  Digha Nikaya iii.74-75, Chakkavattisihanada Suttanta

As earthly paradise moves into its advanced stages, people's inner attitudes
towards God will directly affect more and more aspects of daily life. Those
whose souls are closer to God will be so much of the same heart that they can
communicate without verbalizing their thoughts and feelings.  By this stage,
contemplation will have become the mode of existence for everyone.  God will
have given them such highly refined powers of spiritual perception that they
can at last see His will directly and perfectly understand what is in the
hearts and minds of others.

In its ultimate phase, paradise on earth will be so perfect, so unblemished,
that it may be called the Crystal World.  All evil and hatred will have been
cleansed away.  The world will have become the final realization of absolute
goodness and love.  Completely free from even a hint of sin or impurity,
humankind at last will dwell in the heavenly abode longed for through the ages.
This is the Crystal World of unity  with God.

Then comes the end, when he [Christ] delivers the kingdom to God the Father
after destroying every rule and every authority and power.  For he must reign
until he has put all his enemies under his feet.  The last enemy to be
destroyed is death.

Buddha; see Digha Nikaya iii.76, p. 943.  This description of the ideal world
as one of closely packed villages and kingdoms where none will molest its
neighbor is similar to the Taoist ideal as presented in Tao Te Ching 80, p.

to a 'Crystal World' of purity and harmony.  This transformation is said to
have already begun in this century.  Cf. Vishnu Purana 4.24, p. 942.  1

The holy man told them, "I'll give you something to eat that will kill you, but
don't be afraid; I'll bring you back to life again."  They believed him. They
ate something and died, then found themselves walking in a new, beautiful land.
They spoke with their parents and grandparents, and with friends that the white
soldiers had killed.  Their friends were well, and this new world was like the
old one, the one the white man had destroyed.  It was full of game, full of
antelope and buffalo.  The grass was green and high, and though long-dead
people from other tribes also lived in this land, there was peace. All the
Indian nations formed one tribe and could understand each other. Kicking Bear
and Short Bull walked around and saw everything, and they were happy.  Then the
holy man of the Paiutes brought them back to life again.

"You have seen it," he said, "the new land I'm bringing.  The earth will roll
up like a blanket with all that bad white man's stuff, the fences and railroads
and mines and telegraph poles, and underneath will be our old-young Indian
earth with all our relatives come to life again." Then the holy man taught them
a new dance, a new song, a new prayer.  He gave them sacred red paint....  Now
everywhere we are dancing this new dance to roll up the earth, to bring back
the dead.  A new world is coming.

Neither anxiety to pay tribute nor any imposts;
Neither fear of retribution nor of fall from eminence.
In this happy land where my dwelling is,
Abides unending well-being.
All who therein dwell are blessed with eternal kingship;
None is there reckoned inferior to any.
That city knows no decline;
Its citizens are rich and fulfilled.
Unlimited their freedom--
None are alien there;
All in true liberty abide.
Says Ravidas, the emancipated cobbler,
Only a citizen of that City reckon I my friend.

Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first
earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.  And I saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for
her husband; and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the
dwelling of God is with men.  He will dwell with them, and they shall be his
people, and God himself will be with them.  He will wipe away every tear from
their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor
crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away."

And he who sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new."  Also he
said, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true."  And he said to
me, "It is done!  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To
the thirsty I will give from the fountain of the water of life without payment.
He who conquers shall have this heritage, and I will be his God and he shall be
my son."...

And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty
and the Lamb.  And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for
the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb.  By its light shall
all the nations walk; and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory into
it, and its gates shall never be shut by day--and there shall be no night
there; they shall bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.  But
nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or
falsehood, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.

Then an angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal,
flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street
of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its
twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the
tree were for the healing of the nations.  There shall no more be anything
accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his
servants shall worship him; they shall see his face, and his name shall be on
their foreheads.  And night shall be no more; they need no light of lamp or
sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they shall reign for ever and
ever.

Isaiah 51.11: The promised return to Jerusalem is central to the Jewish
messianic hope; it no doubt helped to fuel the Zionist movement and the

have supported the State of Israel for such theological reasons.  Gauri,

It is our duty in this radiant century to investigate the essentials of divine

For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land
[America], and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that
these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the
covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he has covenanted with his
people, O house of Israel...

If they [the Gentiles] will repent and hearken unto my words, and not harden
their hearts, I will establish my church among them and they shall come unto
the covenant and be numbered among this remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have
given this land for their inheritance;

And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and also as many of the
house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be
called the New Jerusalem.

And then shall they shall assist my people that they may be gathered in, who
are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem.

And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also will be in
their midst.

And then shall the work of the Father commence that day, even when this gospel
shall be preached among the remnant of this people.  Verily I say to you, at
that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my
people, yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led
away out of Jerusalem.

Yea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people, with the
Father, to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on
the Father in my name.

Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father, among all nations, in
preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their
inheritance.

And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go out in haste, nor
go by flight, for I will go before them, says the Father, and I will be their
rearward.

Revelation 21.1-22.5: This is the central Christian passage depicting in
symbolic terms the coming millennium, the Kingdom of Heaven.  Cf. Isaiah
62.4-5, pp. 184-85; Revelation 7.9-17, pp. 309f.  On the Tree of Life as a
symbol, see Psalms 1.1-3, pp. 148f.; John 15.4-11, p. 559.  On the Church as
Bride, see Ephesians 5.22-32, p. 233.  The Promulgation of Universal Peace: For
more from this text, see pp. 256f.  Cf. Gleanings from the Writings of
Baha'u'llah 15, p. 449; 111, p. 243.

As we have observed repeatedly, the development of the cultural spheres also
shows that a worldwide cultural sphere is now being formed centered on one
religion.  Nations, too, are moving toward one worldwide structure of
sovereignty, starting from the League of Nations, through the United Nations,
and reaching today for world government.  Regarding economic development, the
world is now on the threshold of forming one common market.  Extremely
well-developed transportation and communication facilities have reduced the
limitations of time and space.  Men are able to communicate with one another on
the earth as easily as if the earth were the garden of a house in which people
of all the different races of the East and the West lived as one family.  All
mankind is crying out for brotherly love.

However, a home is formed around the parents; there alone can true brotherly
love occur.  Therefore, upon the Second Advent of the Lord as the True Parent
of mankind, all men will come to live harmoniously in the garden as one family.

Nephi 21.1-29: 'My Zion,' the new refuge for the dispersed of God's people, is
to be built in America.  The New World figures centrally in the Latter-day
Saints' expectation of the millennium.  Divine Principle I.3.4.3: 'True Parent'
is a messianic title, specifying the Messiah's parental love for all humankind
and his role as the new Adam, the origin of the new lineage of God that is free
from the sin and death which pervades the lineage of the fallen Adam.  Cf. Sun
Myung Moon, 9-11-77, p. 274; 8-26-86, p. 287; 9-3-89, p. 619; 8-20-89. p. 577.
