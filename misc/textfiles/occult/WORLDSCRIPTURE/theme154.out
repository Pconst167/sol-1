World Scripture

GOVERNMENT BY DIVINE LAW

This section deals with the principle that a government is founded upon respect
for God and conformity to divine law. In Islamic nations, government is
expected to enforce the ordinances of the Shariah. For Hinduism and Buddhism,
the way of proper rule is in accordance with the Dharma. For Confucianism, it
is the way of propriety (li) tempered with benevolence, and for Taoism, in
accordance with the Tao. In ancient Israel, the laws of God were written down
for the king to study.

Modern Western constitutional governments, as well, are founded on the
Judeo-Christian principle that government should be subservient to certain
universal laws (e.g., human rights and social duties). In ancient Israel, the
Law of Moses was given on Mount Sinai prior to the formation of the state;
hence it stood above the state and formed the basis for prophetic critiques of
misrule. In the case of the United States, the Constitution came into existence
prior to the establishment of a government and forms the legal basis for its
authority. A constitution is venerated as a statement of the highest principles
of government; and a proper constitution is neither produced by a government to
codify its policies nor easily amended by the people to express the will of the
majority. Furthermore, modern constitutions contain articles which declare that
certain human rights are inalienable and God-given. Governments cannot
disregard the rights of the people because those rights are not the
government's to grant; enshrined in a constitution, they come from a higher
Law.

Step beyond what is human, elect for the Divine Word, and establish your
leadership, along with all the friends you have.

1. Hinduism. Atharva Veda 7.105

If your kingdom exists for the doctrine And not for fame or desire, Then it
will be extremely fruitful. If not, its fruit will be misfortune.

2. Buddhism. Nagarjuna, Precious Garland 327

A king should abandon his own precious life, But not the jewel of
Righteousness, whereby the world is gladdened.

3. Buddhism. Golden Light Sutra 12

Warned by a dream, Emperor Sujin reverenced the gods, and therefore was lauded
as the wise emperor.

4. Shintoism. Kojiki, Preface

If [a ruler] enjoins fear of God, the Exalted and Glorious, and dispenses
justice, there will be great reward for him; and if he enjoins otherwise, it
resounds on him.

5. Islam. Hadith of Muslim

The Creator... projected that excellent form, justice (dharma). This justice is
the controller of the ruler. Therefore there is nothing higher than justice. So
even a weak man hopes to defeat a stronger man through justice, as one does
with the help of a king.

6. Hinduism. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.14

No individual is lost and no nation is refused prosperity and success if
foundations of their thoughts and actions rest upon piety and godliness, and
upon truth and justice.

327: Cf. Abot 4.14, p. 915. Golden Light Sutra 12: The 'jewel of Righteousness'
means the dharma, one of the Three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. This is
from a longer passage, pp. 923f. Kojiki: In other words, the emperor
established harmony with the kami as the basis for his rule. Brihadaranyaka
Upanishad 1.4.14: Cf. Atharva Veda 4.1.3, p. 140. Nahjul Balagha, Khutba 21:

And you will be yourself ruler and president.... You must in everything
reverence the statutes and proceed by them to the happy rule of the people.
They were the reverence of King Wen and his caution; in proceeding by them to
the happy rule of the people, say, "If I can only attain to them."

8. Confucianism. Book of History 5.9.3.8

The Messenger of God said, "The best of your rulers are those whom you love and
who love you, who invoke God's blessings upon you and you invoke His blessings
upon them. And the worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and who hate
you, and whom you curse and who curse you." It was asked, "Should we not
overthrow them with the sword?" He said, "No, as long as they establish prayer
among you."

9. Islam. Hadith of Muslim

Tao is eternal, but has no fame; The Uncarved Block, though seemingly of small
account, Is greater than anything that is under heaven. If kings and barons
would but possess themselves of it, The ten thousand creatures would flock to
do them homage; Heaven and earth would conspire To send Sweet Dew; Without law
or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony.

10. Taoism. Tao Te Ching 32

Book of History 5.9.3.8: These are the rites and rules of propriety, laid down
from ancient times. It includes the principle of benevolence--cf. Mencius
IV.A.3, p. 919. Hadith of Muslim: This hadith speaks of the ruler's attitude
towards God and the believers. To 'establish prayer' means far more than merely
to tolerate religion; it means to uphold the Muslim faith and the laws of the
Shariah. Tao Te Ching 32: The 'Uncarved Block' means to dwell without making
distinctions or playing favorites, at one with the primal Unity. Cf. Chuang Tzu
7, p. 508; Tao Te Ching 18, p. 260; 80, p. 257; Isaiah 2.2-4, p. 946.

When you come to the land which the Lord your God gives you, and you possess it
and dwell in it, and then say, "I will set a king over me, like all the nations
that are round about me"; you may indeed set a king over you, him whom the Lord
your God will choose.... When he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall
write for himself in a book a copy of this law, from that which is in charge of
the Levitical priests, and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all
the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, by keeping
all the words of this law and these statutes, and doing them; that his heart
may not be lifted up above his brethren, and that he may not turn aside from
the commandment, either to the right hand or to the left; so that he may
continue long in his kingdom, he and his children, in Israel.

11. Judaism and Christianity. Deuteronomy 17.14-20

The Celestial Wheel is no paternal heritage of yours. You yourself do good, as
I did, and earn the Wheel. Act up to the noble ideal of the duty which is set
before true world sovereigns.... You, leaning on the Law, honoring, respecting,
and revering it, doing homage to it, hallowing it, being yourself a banner of
the Law, a signal of the Law, having the Law as your master, should provide the
right watch, ward, and protection for your own people, for the army, for the
nobles, for vassals, for brahmins, and householders, for town and country
dwellers, for the religious world, and for beasts and birds. Throughout your
kingdom let no wrongdoing prevail. And whosoever in your kingdom is poor, to
him let wealth be given.

Deuteronomy 17.14-20: This is the 'Law of the King,' part of the Mosaic Law
which regulated the conduct of kings--though there was as yet no kingdom when
Moses received the Law on Mount Sinai. The king would be responsible to read
the Law of Moses and follow it. Cf. Joshua 1.1-9, p. 891; 2 Samuel 23.3-4, p.
907; Jeremiah 18.3-11, p. 916; Leviticus 26.3-20, p. 916; Isaiah 2.2-4, p. 946.
Digha Nikaya iii.60-61: The 'Law' means the Buddha's Dhamma. This is an excerpt
of the longer passage, pp. 257-58.
