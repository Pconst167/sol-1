                                     Murder
                                World Scripture

                                    MURDER

Murder is condemned by all faiths, as by reason itself. Nevertheless, there is
often a line between murder and sanctioned violence, and this line is drawn in
various ways.  In Jainism, and among some Buddhists, Hindus, and Taoists, the
concept of absolute nonviolence (ahimsa) encompasses all animals and living
beings.  In Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, on the other hand, the scriptural
prohibitions against murder are restricted to the killing of human beings.

Some passages in the Christian, Buddhist, Taoist, and Jewish scriptures may be
interpreted as teaching that killing a human being is a sin under any and all
circumstances.  Hence, some in these traditions regard it as wrong to use
violent means to defend against harm--cf. Turn the Other Cheek, pp. 708-10.
Pacifism and objections to capital punishment likewise derive from this
scriptural foundation.  Other passages, a selection of which are given here,
may be interpreted as restricting the definition of murder to an individual
killing for selfish purposes.  They permit killing in self-defense, permit
killing to prevent greater crimes, sanction state enforcement of the death
penalty, and support the waging of war for just cause.  Nevertheless, killing
in such circumstances should still be viewed as evil, albeit the lesser evil.
The inferior morality of killing in self-defense or in retaliation is
highlighted in the two versions of the story of Cain and Abel from the Bible
and the Qur'an.  In the biblical story God grants Cain a mark to protect him
from retaliation, and in the Qur'anic version Abel shows his righteousness by
refusing to defend himself from Cain's aggression.

Related crimes which are treated in the latter part of this section include
infanticide, abortion, and suicide.  Abortion is a topic of much current
controversy in the West--many religious people regard it as a crime analogous
to infanticide--yet there is no mention in the Bible. Abortion is often
condemned in the scriptures of Eastern religions.  We have also selected a few
representative scriptural condemnations of suicide.  However, certain
religions, notably Jainism, approve of religious suicide as an extremely
effective means of penance.

You shall not kill.

                   1. Judaism and Christianity.  Exodus 20.13

The essence of right conduct is not to injure anyone; one should know only
this, that non-injury is religion.

                          2. Jainism.  Naladiyar 14-15

He who commits murder must be considered as the worst offender, more wicked
than a defamer, than a thief, and than he who injures with a staff.

                        3. Hinduism.  Laws of Manu 8.345

Anyone who kills a believer intentionally will have his reward in hell, to
remain there.  God will be angry with him and curse him, and prepare awful
torment for him.

                             4. Islam.  Qur'an 4.92

Only one single man [Adam] was created in the world, to teach that, if any man
has caused a single soul to perish, Scripture imputes it to him as though he
had caused the whole world to perish, and if any man saves alive a single soul,
Scripture imputes it to him as though he had saved the whole world.

All tremble at the rod.  All fear death.  Comparing others with oneself, one
should neither strike nor cause to strike.

All tremble at the rod.  Life is dear to all.  Comparing others with oneself,
one should neither strike nor cause to strike.

Whoever, seeking his own happiness, harms with the rod other pleasure-loving
beings, experiences no happiness hereafter.

Whoever, seeking his own happiness, harms not with the rod other
pleasure-loving beings, experiences happiness hereafter.

                        6. Buddhism.  Dhammapada 129-32

In wars to gain land, the dead fill the plains; in wars to gain cities, the
dead fill the cities.  This is known as showing the land the way to devour
human flesh.  Death is too light a punishment for such men [who wage war].
Hence those skilled in war should suffer the most severe punishments.

Victory breeds hatred, for the defeated live in pain.  Happily live the
peaceful, giving up victory and defeat.

                          8. Buddhism.  Dhammapada 201

A man once came before Raba and said to him, "The ruler of my city has ordered
me to kill a certain person, and if I refuse he will kill me." Raba told him,
"Be killed and do not kill; do you think that your blood is redder than his?
Perhaps his is redder than yours."

                        9. Judaism.  Talmud, Pesahim 25b

We could surmise that murdering an enemy whom all people, as well as yourself,
dislike cannot be a crime.  But even the hated man has the same cosmic value as
you.  Murdering is a crime, because by murdering a person you infringe upon a
cosmic law.

Then they came up and laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.  And behold, one of
those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and
struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  Then Jesus said to
him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will
perish by the sword."

                      11. Christianity.  Matthew 26.51-52

Fine weapons are instruments of evil.
They are hated by men.
Therefore those who possess Tao turn away from them....
Weapons are instruments of evil, not the instruments of a good ruler.
When he uses them unavoidably, he regards calm restraint as the best principle.

Even when he is victorious, he does not regard it as praiseworthy,
For to praise victory is to delight in the slaughter of men.
He who delights in the slaughter of men will not succeed in the empire....
For the slaughter of the multitude, let us weep with sorrow and grief.
For a victory, let us observe the occasion with funeral ceremonies.

                      13. Judaism.  Talmud, Sanhedrin 72a

Do not take life--which God has made sacred--except for just cause.  And if
anyone is slain wrongfully, we have given his heir authority to demand
retribution; but let him not exceed bounds in the matter of taking life, for he
is helped by the law.

                            14. Islam.  Qur'an 17.33

O sons of Abdul Muttalib, let there be no retaliation for the act of murder. Do
not roam about with a drawn sword... and do not start a massacre of my
opponents and enemies.  See that only one man, that is my murderer, is killed
in punishment for the crime of murder, and that nobody else is molested or
harmed or harassed.  The punishment to the man who attempted the murder shall
take place only when I die of the wound delivered by him, and this punishment
shall be only one stroke of the sword to end [his] life.  He should not be
tortured before his death; his hands and feet should not be cut off, because I
have heard the Holy Prophet saying, "Do not cut off the hands and feet of
anybody, be it a biting dog."

                 15. Islam (Shiite).  Nahjul Balagha, Letter 47

Suppose a bodhisattva sees that a vicious robber intends to kill many people
for the sake of wealth; or intends to harm virtuous shravakas, pratyekabuddhas,
or bodhisattvas; or intends to do other things that will cause him to fall into
the Uninterrupted hell.  When seeing this, the bodhisattva will think, "If I
kill that person, I will fall into the hells; if I do not kill him, he will
commit crimes which will lead him to the Uninterrupted hell, where he will
suffer greatly.  I would rather kill him and fall to the hells myself than let
him undergo great suffering in the Uninterrupted hell."

Then, deeply regretting the necessity for this action, and with a heart full of
compassion, he will kill that person.  In doing this, he does not violate the
bodhisattva precepts; instead, he generates many merits.

Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain... and again, she
bore his brother Abel.  Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of
the ground.  In the course of time Cain brought to the Lord an offering of the
fruit of the ground, and Abel brought of the firstlings of the flock and of
their fat portions.  And the Lord had regard for Abel and his offering, but for
Cain and his offering He had no regard.  So Cain was very angry, and his
countenance fell.  The Lord said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your
countenance fallen?  If you do well, will you not be accepted?  And if you do
not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must
master it."

Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let us go out into the field."  And when they
were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him. Then
the Lord said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?"  He replied, "I do not
know; am I my brother's keeper?"  And the Lord said, "What have you done? The
voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.  And now you are
cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's
blood from your hand.  When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to
you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."  Cain
said to the Lord, "My punishment is greater than I can bear. Behold, you have
driven me this day away from the ground; and from your face I shall be hidden;
and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me
will slay me."  Then the Lord said to him, "Not so!  If any one slays Cain,
vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold."  And the Lord put a mark on Cain,
lest any who came upon him should kill him.  Then Cain went away from the
presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

                  17. Judaism and Christianity.  Genesis 4.1-16

And recite for them the story of the two sons of Adam truthfully, when they
offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted of one of them, and not accepted of
the other.  "I will surely slay you," said one.  "God accepts only of the
god-fearing," said the other.

"Yet if you stretch out your hand against me, to slay me, I will not stretch
out my hand against you, to slay you; I fear God, the Lord of all Beings.  I
desire that you should be laden with my sin and your sin, and so become an
inhabitant of the Fire; that is the recompense of the evildoers."

Then his soul prompted him to slay his brother, and he slew him, and became one
of the losers.

Then God sent forth a raven, scratching into the earth, to show him how he
might conceal the vile body of his brother.  He said, "Woe is me! Am I unable
to be as this raven, and so conceal my brother's vile body?" And he became one
of the remorseful.

Therefore We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a human
being, except to retaliate for manslaughter or for corruption done in the land,
it shall be as if he had killed all of humankind; and whoso saves the life of
one, it shall be as if he had saved the lives of all humankind.

He who killed himself with steel would be the eternal denizen of the Fire of

would sip that in the Fire of hell where he is doomed for ever and ever; and he
who killed himself by falling from a mountain would constantly be falling in

"Of what use to you is this evil, difficult life?  Death is better for you than
life," thus having his mind set on the other's death and with the idea that he
should die, praises death in various ways or incites him to commit suicide,
commits an offense entailing loss of monkhood.
