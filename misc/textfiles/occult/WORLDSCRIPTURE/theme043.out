                                HEAVEN AND HELL
                                World Scripture

                                HEAVEN AND HELL

Some conception of heaven and hell is found universally among the religions of
the world.  Descriptions of these abodes are often full of graphic and fanciful
imagery, conveying in metaphor a reality that can hardly be part of the
ordinary experience of mortals.  Are these realms objectively real?  The
scriptures are unanimous in affirming they are. Yet they do not have any
physical location: "up" or "down" is a matter of spiritual geography, not of
astronomy or geology.  The view found in some texts, that heaven or hell is
derived from one's state of mind,1 does not make it any less real.  For the
attitudes and desires of people's hearts, which may be hidden by the external
features of mortal life, are the equivalent of material reality in the realms
of spirit.

A number of the Hindu, Buddhist, and Taoist passages speak of Yama, the Indic
god of the dead.  Yama is not comparable to the devil or Satan who, in
Christian belief, is the author of evil.  In the Vedas, he presides over the
bright realms and is the object of offerings and supplications for the benefit
of the departed.  As the lord of hell in Buddhism, his acts are strictly in
accordance with divine law, meting out punishments according to people's karma,
and in one Taoist text reprinted here he even gives an object lesson to turn
people away from evil.

Some ambiguity plagues the descriptions of heaven and hell in the scriptures of
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which can be interpreted either to describe
the state of the soul upon death or what will be after the future Resurrection.
The Qur'anic passages collected here which describe the opening of Paradise and
hell are a few of many which refer to the last judgment. Most Muslims,
therefore, regard the dead to be sleeping in the grave awaiting that momentous
event.  Yet other passages, such as the hadith describing Muhammad's Night
Journey,2 point to the present reality of Heaven as the dwelling place for the
souls of the righteous. The biblical vision of Heaven from the Revelation and
the passage from the same book about the lake of fire are visions of a future
recompense after the tribulations of the Last Judgment. Those Christians who
hold to a literal interpretation of these verses concur with their Muslim
brothers and sisters that the souls of the dead are asleep in the grave,
awaiting the future opening of Heaven and hell.  But another strand of the
Christian tradition, supported by biblical descriptions of the Sheol in Job
3.17-19, the heavenly Jerusalem in Hebrews 12.22-24, and the story of Lazarus
and the rich man in Luke 16.19-31, teaches that upon death each person
immediately enters his appointed place in Heaven or hell.  The visions in
Revelation are often interpreted in this way, and have spawned such classic
descriptions as Dante's Divine Comedy.  The concept of the World to Come in
Rabbinic Jewish writings is similarly ambiguous: the World to Come may be a
present Heaven or describe a future redemption on earth.3

Neng 6, p. 348.
2. See Qur'an 2.154, p. 330, and 39.42, p. 333.
3. The resolution of these two doctrines comes at the eschatological time of
redemption, when the realization of the Kingdom of God on earth brings with it
a transformation of heaven: 'a new heaven and a new earth'--cf. Revelation
21.1-22.5, pp. 1118f; Isaiah 24.18-23, p. 1098; Qur'an 21.104-05, p. 1111;
69.13-17, pp. 1098f.  The destruction of evil and the triumph of good, when God
becomes all in all, effects liberation for the earthly realms and the spiritual
realms alike.  See also passages which teach that the words "life" and "death"
often refer to a state of grace rather than physical life or death: Luke 9.60,
p. 583; Qur'an 6.122, p. 583; Berakot 18ab, p. 583.  In that light we can also
understand resurrection to mean the enlivening and salvation of those in the
spiritual realms as well as on earth.

                                    HEAVEN

The world's scriptures describe Heaven as a place of rest, or as an exalted
spiritual state, full of divine splendor and communion with the Absolute.
There are also descriptions using more graphic and materialistic imagery:
gardens of delights, with riches and pleasures abounding.  A number of texts
describe it as a place of fellowship with the spirits of the departed or a
fellowship of saints.  We conclude with visions or tours of Heaven: the
Buddhist description of the Pure Land, the vision of throngs surrounding the
divine throne in the Book of Revelation, and Muhammad's Night Journey.

There the wicked cease from troubling,
and there the weary are at rest.
There the prisoners are at ease together;
they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.
The small and the great are there,
and the slave is free from his master.

Chuang Tzu said, "Were I to prevail upon God to allow your body to be born
again, and your bones and flesh to be renewed, so that you could return to your
parents, to your wife, and to the friends of your youth, would you be willing?"

At this, the skull opened its eyes wide and knitted its brows and said, "How
should I cast aside happiness greater than that of a king, and mingle once
again in the toils and troubles of mortality?"

In Gardens of Bliss;
A number of people from those of old,
and a few from those of later times.
They will be on thrones encrusted, reclining on them, facing each other.
Round about them will serve youths of perpetual freshness,
with goblets, shining beakers, and cups filled out of clear-flowing fountains;
No after-ache will they receive therefrom, nor will they suffer intoxication;
And with fruits, any that they may select,
And the flesh of fowls, any that they may desire.
And there will be companions with beautiful, big and lustrous eyes,
Like unto pearls well-guarded:
A reward for the deeds of their past life.
No frivolity will they hear therein, nor any taint of ill,
Only the saying "Peace! Peace!"

Higher than all stands the Realm of Grace--
None can have access there except heroes of supreme might,
Inspired by God-consciousness.
In that sphere abide numberless heroines like Sita of surpassing praise
And beauty indescribable.
Those to God united suffer not mortality nor delusion.
In that sphere abide devotees assembled from the various universes,
Cherishing the holy Eternal ever in their hearts.
In everlasting bliss.
The formless Supreme Being abides in the Realm of Eternity.
Over His creation He casts His glance of grace.
In that realm are contained all the continents and universes,
Exceeding in number all count.
Of creation, worlds upon worlds abide therein--
All obedient to His Will;
He watches over them in bliss,
And has each constantly in mind.

attempt the impossible.

he recovered, his father asked him, "What did you see?"  He replied, "I beheld

and vice versa."  He said to him, "My son, you have seen a corrected world.
But what is the position of us students of Torah there?" He answered, "We are

learning;' and I further heard it said that martyrs occupy an eminence which

Then said the Exalted One, "Well, Hatthaka, do things go on now just the same
as before, when you were in human shape?"

"Yes, Lord, they do.  But there are also some things now going on which I did
not experience when I was in human shape.  Just as, Lord, the Exalted One now
dwells surrounded by brethren and sisters, by lay-brothers and lay-sisters, by
royalties and ministers, by sectarians and their followers--just so do I dwell
surrounded by sons of devas.  Even from a distance, Lord, do sons of the devas
come saying, 'We'll hear the Norm from the lips of Hatthaka, son of a deva.'

"Of three things, Lord, I never got enough.  I died regretful of three things.
What were they?  I never had enough of beholding the Exalted One.  I died
regretting it.  I never had enough of hearing the good Norm.  I died regretting
it.  I never had enough of serving the Order of Brethren.  I died regretting
it."

O Ananda, the world called Sukhavati (the Pure Land), which is the world system
of the Lord Amitabha, is rich and prosperous, comfortable, fertile, delightful,
and crowded with many gods and men.  And in this world, Ananda, there are no
hells, no animals, no ghosts, no devils, and no inauspicious places of rebirth.
And there do not appear in this world such gems as are known in the world
Sukhavati.

And that world Sukhavati, Ananda, is fragrant with many sweet-smelling odors,
rich in manifold flowers and fruits, adorned with jewel trees, and frequented
by flocks of various birds with sweet voices, which have been produced by the
miraculous power of the Tathagata.  The jewel trees have various colors, many
colors, many hundreds of thousands of colors.  They are composed of varying
combinations of the seven precious things: gold, silver, beryl, crystal, coral,
red pearls, and emerald...  Their roots, trunks, branches, leaves, flowers, and
fruits are pleasant to touch, and fragrant. And when these trees, are moved by
the wind, a sweet and delightful sound proceeds from them, which one never
tires of hearing.  Such jewel trees, and clusters of banana trees and rows of
palm trees, all made of precious gems, grow everywhere in this Buddha-land.  On
all sides it is surrounded with golden nets, and all round covered with lotus
flowers made of all the precious things.  Some of the lotus flowers are half a
mile in circumference, others up to ten miles.  And from each jewel lotus issue
thirty-six hundred thousand billions of rays of light.  And at the end of each
ray issue thirty-six hundred thousand billions of Buddhas, with golden-colored
bodies, who bear the thirty-two marks of the great man, and who, in all the ten
directions, go into the countless [lower] realms and there teach the Law.

And many kinds of rivers flow along in this Pure Land.  There are great rivers
there, one mile broad, and up to fifty miles broad and twelve miles deep.  All
these rivers flow along calmly; their water is fragrant with manifold agreeable
odors, and in them are bunches of flowers to which various jewels adhere, and
they resound with various sweet sounds.  And the sound which issues from these
great rivers is as pleasant as that of a musical instrument consisting of
hundreds of thousands of billions of parts, and which, skillfully played, emits
a heavenly music.  It is deep, commanding, distinct, clear, pleasant to the
ear, touching the heart, delightful, and one never tires of hearing it, as if
it always said, "Impermanent, peaceful, calm, and not-self."  Such is the sound
that reaches the ears of those beings. And, Ananda, both banks of those great
rivers are lined with variously scented jewel trees, and from them bunches of
flowers, leaves, and branches of all kinds hang down.  And if those beings wish
to indulge in sports full of heavenly delights on those river-banks, then,
after they have stepped into the water, the water in each case rises as high as
they wish it to--up to the ankles, or to the knees, or to the hips, or to their
sides, or to their ears. And heavenly delights arise.  Again, if beings wish
the water to be cold, for them it becomes cold; if they wish it to be hot, for
them it becomes hot; if they wish it to be hot and cold, for them it becomes
hot and cold, to suit their pleasure.  And those rivers flow along, full of
water scented with the best perfumes, covered with lilies, lotus, and all
manner of beautiful flowers, resounding with the sounds of peacocks, sparrows,
parrots, ducks, geese, herons, cranes, swans, and others, with small islands
inhabited by flocks of birds, easy to ford, free from mud, and with golden sand
on the bottom.  And all the wishes those beings may think of, they will be
fulfilled, as long as they are rightful.

After this I looked, and lo, in heaven an open door!  And the first voice,
which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up hither, and I
will show you what must take place after this."  At once I was in the Spirit,
and lo, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne!  And he who
sat there appeared like jasper and carnelian, and round the throne was a
rainbow that looked like an emerald.  Round the throne were twenty-four
thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clad in white
garments, with golden crowns upon their heads.  From the throne issue flashes
of lightning, and voices and peals of thunder, and before the throne burn seven
torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God; and before the throne
there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.

And round the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures,
full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the
second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a
man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle.  And the four living
creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes round about and
within, and day and night they never cease to sing,

Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
who was and is and is to come!

After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number,
from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the
throne and before the Lamb [Christ], clothed in white robes, with palm branches
in their hands, and crying out with a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God
who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb!"...

Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these, clothed in white
robes, and whence have they come?"  I said to him, "Sir, you know."  And he
said to me, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they
have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

Therefore they are before the throne of God,
and serve him day and night within his temple;
and he who sits upon the throne will shelter them with his presence.
They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;
the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.
For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
and he will guide them to springs of living water;
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."

Anas ibn Malik said, "Abu Dharr recounted that the Messenger of God said,
'While I was at Mecca, the roof of my house opened and Gabriel entered.  He
opened my chest, washed me with the water of Zamzam, brought a golden basin
full of faith and wisdom and emptied all of it into my chest.  After that he
closed it, took me by the hand and raised me towards the lowest heaven.  When I
arrived at the lowest heaven, Gabriel said to the door-keeper "Open."  "Who is
there?" he asked.  "Gabriel," the angel replied.  "Is there anyone with you?"
responded the door-keeper.  "Yes," replied Gabriel, "Muhammad is with me."
"Has he been commanded?" added the door-keeper.  "Yes," said the angel. When
the door-keeper had opened to us, we rose up within the lowest heaven, and
suddenly we saw a man sitting, having some spirits on his right and others on
his left.  Every time he looked to the right he smiled, but as soon as he
looked to the left he wept.  He said, "Welcome virtuous prophet and virtuous
son."  "Who is this?" I asked Gabriel.  "This man," he replied, "is Adam, and
those spirits on the right are destined to Paradise, while the spirits on his
left are destined to hell.  That is why, when he looks to the right, he smiles,
and when he looks to the left, he weeps."

"'Then Gabriel raised me up to the second heaven and said to the door-keeper,
"Open."  He asked the same questions as the first, and then opened to us.'"
Anas recounted that Abu Dharr said that the Prophet found in the various
heavens Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus, and Abraham, but he was not certain which
were the positions they occupied.  What he does say is that Muhammad found Adam
in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth heaven.

Anas adds, "When Gabriel came with the Prophet into the presence of Idris, the
latter said, 'Welcome virtuous prophet.'" "When I asked 'Who is this?'" the
Prophet went on, "Gabriel answered me, 'It is Idris.'  Then I went into the
presence of Moses, who said, 'Welcome virtuous prophet and virtuous brother.'
'Who is this?' I asked.  'Moses' replied the angel.  I then went into the
presence of Jesus, who exclaimed, 'Welcome virtuous prophet and virtuous
brother.' 'Who is it?' I said.  'Jesus' replied Gabriel.  I went after that
into the presence of Abraham, who said, 'Welcome virtuous prophet and virtuous
brother.'  'Who is it?' I asked. 'It is Abraham,' the angel said to me."

Ibn Hazm records that Ibn `Abbas and Abu Habba al-Ansari said that the Prophet
used the following words, "Then the angel raised me until he brought me to a
height where I heard the beating of wings....  Then Gabriel led me away and
brought me to the lote-tree of the Boundary, which is covered with unspeakably
beautiful colors.  Next I entered Paradise. There are domes of pearls, and the
sun there is made of musk."
