                                  Eternal Truth

                                 ETERNAL TRUTH

This section begins with passages on the pre-existence of the Word, Truth,
Wisdom, or Principle before the creation of the universe, and its function in
guiding the creative process.  They are followed by passages on the pervading
reality of Truth which operates through the specific laws of the cosmos.
Sometimes this Truth may be grasped by ordinary reason as the impersonal laws
which govern the cosmos.  Other passages describe the essence of Truth as that
which is comprehended only in Christ, or in Buddha, or in the mind of the sage.
It does not partake of anything evil or immoral, according to Confucianism, and
hence is only accessible to the moral person.  Analogously for Christians, the
Word is manifested completely only in Christ, the perfect man.  Finally, this
spiritual Word, according to Buddhism, is hidden from surface phenomena and may
be understood only when the external world is not grasped or discriminated. It
is 'Mind-only,' a theme that finds echoes in contemporary metaphysical
movements such as Christian Science.

He has created the heavens and the earth with truth.

From the bosom of the sacred Word he brought forth the world.  On high, below,
he abides in his own laws.

Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne; steadfast love and
faithfulness go before thee.

                3. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Psalm 8914

God moves according to universal law.  Universal law does not work for the sake
of oneself, but for the public good.  Universal law embodies the spirit of
sacrifice and service towards others.

By Truth is the earth sustained,
and by the sun are the heavens;

and Soma is set in the sky.

God ordained the measures of the creation fifty thousand years before He
created the heavens and the earth, while His throne was on the waters.

                          6. Islam.  Hadith of Muslim

This, [in the beginning] was the only Lord of the Universe.  His Word was with
him.  This Word was his second.  He contemplated.  He said, "I will deliver
this Word so that she will produce and bring into being all this world."

                   7. Hinduism.  Tandya Maha Brahmana 20.14.2

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God; all things were made through him, and without
him was not anything made that was made.  In him was life, and the life was the
light of men.

                      8. Christianity.  Bible, John 1.1-4

Universal Order and Truth
were born of blazing spiritual fire,
and thence night was born, and thence
the billowy ocean of space.

From the billowy ocean of space
was born Time--the year
ordaining days and nights,
the ruler of every moment.

In the beginning, as before,
the Creator made the sun,
the moon, the heaven and the earth,
the firmament and the realm of light.

Absolute; cf. Rig Veda 1.64.45, p. 806.  John 1.1-4: In Greek philosophy, the
Word is the logos or plan by which God created the universe. The Bible asserts
that Christ is himself the Word, the model and plan for creation; cf.
Colossians 1.15-17.  The Buddhist doctrine of the Dharmakaya, by which the
Buddha is one with the eternally abiding reality of the universe, is similar
except that there is no creation; cf. Lion's Roar of Queen Srimala 5, p. 652;
Samyutta Nikaya iii.120, p. 651.

The Lord created me at the beginning of his work,
the first of his acts of old.
Ages ago I was set up,
at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
When there were no depths I was brought forth,
when there were no springs abounding with water.
Before the mountains had been shaped,
before the hills, I was brought forth.
Before he had made the earth with its fields,
or the first of the dust of the world.
When he established the heavens, I was there,
when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
When he made firm the skies above,
when he established the fountains of the deep,
When he assigned to the sea its limit,
so that the waters might not transgress his command,
when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
Then I was beside him, like a master workman;
I was daily his delight,
rejoicing before him always;
rejoicing in his inhabited world,
and delighting in the sons of men.

             10. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Proverbs 8.22-31

"Then I was beside Him, as a nursling (amon); and I was daily all [His]
delight" (Proverbs 8.30).... 'Amon' is a workman (uman).  The Torah thus
declares, "I was the working tool of the Holy One, blessed be He."  In human
practice, when a mortal king builds a palace, he builds it not with his own
skill but with the skill of an architect.  The architect moreover does not
build it out of his head, but employs plans and diagrams to know how to arrange
the chambers and the doors.  Thus God consulted the Torah and created the world.

Rig Veda 10.190.1-3: Tapas, the 'spiritual fire' harnessed and concentrated
through meditation, is regarded as the source of all creative energy; cf.
Mundaka Upanishad 1.1.8, p. 132; Prasna Upanishad 1.4-5, p. 176.  Truth and
Order were the first productions of tapas.  In the third stanza, the words 'as
before' indicates recurrent creation. Proverbs 8.22-31: Wisdom is personified
here and in Proverbs 8.1-11, pp. 788f.  For Christians wisdom is the
preexistent Word that is incarnate in Christ; for Jews wisdom is Torah, as in
the following passage, which is a midrash (rabbinic interpretation) on this
one. On the pre-existence of wisdom, cf. 1 Corinthians 2.6-7, p. 538.
Regarding the term 'master workman,' the Hebrew word 'amon' is rare, and some
translate it 'little child,' which seems better to fit the context.  See the
next passage.  Genesis Rabbah 1.1: See previous note.

I pay homage to the Perfection of Wisdom!  She is worthy of homage.  She is
unstained, the entire world cannot stain her.  She is a source of light, and
from everyone in the triple world she removes darkness, and she leads away from
the blinding darkness caused by the defilements and by wrong views.  In her we
can find shelter.  Most excellent are her works.  She makes us seek the safety
of the wings of Enlightenment.  She brings light to the blind, she brings light
so that all fear and distress may be forsaken....  She is the mother of the
Bodhisattvas, on account of the emptiness of her own marks.  As the donor of
the jewel of all the Buddha-dharmas she brings about the ten powers [of a
Buddha].  She cannot be crushed.  She protects the unprotected, with the help
of the four grounds of self-confidence.  She is the antidote to
birth-and-death.  She has a clear knowledge of the own-being of all dharmas,
for she does not stray away from it.  The Perfection of Wisdom of the Buddhas,
the Lords, sets in motion the Wheel of the Law.

        12. Buddhism.  Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines 7.1

The Tao has its reality and its signs but is without action or form.  You can
hand it down but you cannot receive it; you can get it but you cannot see it.
It is its own source, its own root.  Before heaven and earth existed it was
there, firm from ancient times.  It gave spirituality to the spirits and to
God; it gave birth to heaven and to earth.  It exists beyond the highest point,
and yet you cannot call it lofty; it exists beneath the limit of the six
directions, and yet you cannot call it deep.  It was born before heaven and
earth, and yet you cannot say it has been there for long; it is earlier than
the earliest time, and yet you cannot call it old.

By Divine Law are all forms manifested;
Inexpressible is the Law.
By Divine Law are beings created;
By Law are some exalted.
By Divine Law are beings marked with nobility or ignominy;
By the Law are they visited with bliss or bale.
On some by His Law falls grace;
Others by His Law are whirled around in cycles of births and deaths.
All by the Law are governed,
None is exempt.
Says Nanak, Should man realize the power of the Law,
He would certainly disclaim his ego.

                  14. Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Japuji 2, M.1, p. 1

The moral law is to be found everywhere, and yet it is a secret.

The simple intelligence of ordinary men and women of the people may understand
something of the moral law; but in its utmost reaches there is something which
even the wisest and holiest men cannot understand.  The ignoble natures of
ordinary men and women of the people may be able to carry out the moral law;
but in its utmost reaches even the wisest and holiest of men cannot live up to
it.

Great as the Universe is, man is yet not always satisfied with it. For there is
nothing so great but the mind of the moral man can conceive of something still
greater which nothing in the world can hold.  There is nothing so small but the
mind of the moral man can conceive of something still smaller which nothing in
the world can split.

The Book of Songs says,

The hawk soars to the heavens above
Fishes dive to the depths below.

That is to say, there is no place in the highest heavens above nor in the
deepest waters below where the moral law is not to be found.  The moral man
finds the moral law beginning in the relation between man and woman; but ending
in the vast reaches of the universe.

The question as to when the union of soul with karma occurred for the first

The ten thousand things all come from the same seed, and with their different

ring and no one can comprehend its principle.  This is called Heaven the
Equalizer.

The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal

What, brethren, is causal happening?
"Conditioned by rebirth is decay and death."
Whether, brethren, there be an arising of Tathagatas or whether there be no
such arising, this nature of things just stands, this causal status, this
causal orderliness, the relatedness of this to that.

Concerning the prime, rare, hard-to-understand dharmas, only a Buddha and a
Buddha can exhaust their reality, namely, the suchness of the dharmas, the
suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their
substance, the suchness of their powers, the suchness of their functions, the
suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of
their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the absolute identity of
their beginning and end.

In the Book of Songs it is said,

The ordinance of God,
How inscrutable it is and goes on for ever.

That is to say, this is the essence of God.  It is again said,

How excellent it is,
The moral perfection of King Wen.

That is to say, this is the essence of the noble character of the Emperor Wen.
Moral perfection also never dies.

reveals the eternal truth by his own personal example and way of life--the
manifestation of God's love and truth.  This and the following passages
describe the truth as that which is comprehended by the mind of a saint.  Lotus
Sutra 2: There is one ultimate reality which embraces everything--'suchness.'
This is also expressed through the universality of the Buddha nature and the
all-encompassing Dharmakaya which is the Buddha's body.  There is nothing real
apart from Reality itself. Doctrine of the Mean 26.10: In other words, the
truth of Heaven and the moral perfection of the sage are alike; both continue
for ever.

"What is meant by an eternally-abiding reality?  The ancient road of reality,
Mahamati, has been here all the time, like gold, silver, or pearl preserved in
the mine.  The Dharmadhatu (Absolute Truth) abides forever, whether the
Tathagata appears in the world or not.  As the Tathagata eternally abides so
does the Reason of all things.  Reality forever abides, reality keeps its
order, like the roads in an ancient city.

For instance, a man who is walking in a forest and discovering an ancient city
with its orderly streets may enter into the city, and having entered into it,
he may have a rest, conduct himself like a citizen, and enjoy all the pleasures
accruing therefrom.  What do you think, Mahamati? Did this man make the road
along which he enters into the city, and the various things in the city?"

"No, Blessed One."

"Just so, what has been realized by myself and the other Tathagatas is this
Reality, this eternally-abiding reality, the self-regulating reality, the
Suchness of things, the Realness of things, the truth itself.

The world of the ignorant is observed as the continuation of birth and death,
whereby dualisms are nourished, and because of the perversion [the truth] is
not perceived.

There is just one truth, which is Nirvana--it has nothing to do with
intellection.  The world seen as subject to discrimination resembles a plantain
tree, a dream, a mirage.

The Mind as norm is the abode of self-nature which has nothing to do with the
realm of causation; of this norm, which is perfect existence and the highest
Absolute, I speak.

Of neither existence nor non-existence do I speak, but of Mind-only which has
nothing to do with existence and non-existence, and which is thus free from
intellection.

Suchness, emptiness, Absolute Truth... these I call Mind-only.

                  26. Buddhism.  Lankavatara Sutra 61, 63, 64

The universe, like man, is to be interpreted by Science from its divine
Principle, God, and then it can be understood; but when explained on the basis
of physical sense and represented as subject to growth, maturity, and decay,
the universe, like man, is, and must continue to be, an enigma.

Adhesion, cohesion, and attraction are properties of Mind.  They belong to
divine Principle, and support the equipoise of that thought-force, which
launched the earth in its orbit and said to the proud wave, "Thus far and no
farther."

Spirit is the life, substance and continuity of all things.  We tread on
forces.  Withdraw them, and creation must collapse.  Human knowledge calls them
forces of matter; but divine Science declares that they belong wholly to divine
Mind, are inherent in this Mind, and so restores them to their rightful home
and classification.
