                           Immanent And Near At Hand
                                World Scripture

                           IMMANENT AND NEAR AT HAND

This section brings together passages on God's immanence.  God is described in
the Qur'an as "nearer than the jugular vein," knowing all a person's thoughts
and desires, and abiding within the human heart.  In the Bible, God's immanence
is expressed in the revelation to Elijah, where instead of a grand
manifestation in earthquake or thunder, God's self-revelation is as 'a still
small voice.'  They may speak of God coming near or dwelling in the heart only
when there is receptivity, humility, and faith.  In the scriptures of the
Abrahamic religions, while God is near at hand, He is rarely identified with
the soul itself; that could be seen as tantamount to idolatry.

Other traditions teach more thoroughgoing notions of divine immanence. Sufis
interpret the Qur'anic parable of the Lamp as expressing the presence of God in
the human heart as a light, illuminating the lamp of the body.  In Hinduism,
Sikhism, and Jainism the divine immanence is described ontologically: Ultimate
Reality is the Self (Atman).  In Buddhism the divine immanence is described
psychologically: Essence of Mind or Suchness (Tathata) is realized by a mind
dwelling in Perfect Wisdom and expressing a mind of enlightenment (bodhi),
Dhamma nature or Buddha nature. But there is no ontological self which could be
immanent.  These various doctrines of divine immanence avoid a simple
identification of God with the individual soul.  The ordinary individual soul
(jiva) is beclouded and deluded by an egoistic sense of self; in contrast, the
divine Self within, or Suchness, can only be realized through enlightenment.

The complete realization of the God within is a potential and a goal; passages
which describe it as a state of existence are often referring to the ideal
realized by an attained person.  This ideal will be treated more fully in
Chapter 3.  Yet as many of these selections point out, even the ordinary
beclouded mind is intrinsically pure and contains the germ of divinity.

We indeed created man; and We know what his soul whispers within him, and We
are nearer to him than the jugular vein.

                            1. Islam.  Qur'an 50.16

Ever is He present with you--think not He is far:
By the Master's teaching recognize Him within yourself.

[God] is not far from each one of us, for "In him we live and move and have our
being."

The Master said, "Is Goodness indeed so far away?  If we really wanted
Goodness, we should find that it was at our very side."

Brahman shines forth, vast, self-luminous, inconceivable, subtler than the
subtle.  He is far beyond what is far, and yet here very near at hand. Verily,
He is seen here, dwelling in the cave of the heart of conscious beings.

                      5. Hinduism,  Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.7

For thus says the high and lofty One
who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy,
"I dwell in the high and holy place,
and also with him who is of a contrite and humble spirit,
to revive the spirit of the humble,
and to revive the heart of the contrite."

                6. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, Isaiah 57.15

"If I [God] am there, all are there, and if I am not there, who is there?"
Hillel also used to say, "To the place where I wish to be, there do my feet
bring me.  If you come to my house, I will come to your house; if you do not
come to my house, I will not come to your house."  As it says, "In all places
where I cause my Name to be mentioned, I will come to you and bless you."

Great Deng is near, and some say far, O Divinity!
The Creator is near, and some say he has not reached us!
Do you not hear, O Divinity?
The black bull of the rain has been released from the moon's byre,
Do you not hear, O Divinity?

Why do you go to the forest in search of God?
He lives in all and is yet ever distinct;
He abides with you, too,
As a fragrance dwells in a flower,
And reflection in a mirror;
So does God dwell inside everything;
Seek Him, therefore, in your heart.

                 9. Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Dhanasri, M.9, p. 684

The supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it
dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action.  As
radiation pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be
tainted though it dwells in every creature.

                       10. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 13.32

Within our Essence of Mind the Trikaya (Three Bodies) of Buddha are to be
found, and they are common to everybody.  Because the mind labors under
delusions, he knows not his own inner nature; and the result is that he ignores
the Trikaya within himself, erroneously believing that they are to be sought
from without.  Within yourself you will find the Trikaya which, being the
manifestation of the Essence of Mind, are not to be sought from without.

Dinka Song: The intention of the song in suggesting that 'some say far' is to
urge Divinity to come near and help.  Dhanasri, M.9: Cf. Suhi, M.5, p. 399.
Sutra of Hui Neng 6: 'Essence of Mind' as Hui Neng uses the term denotes the
original mind which is intrinsically the same as Buddha nature; cf. other
passages from this sutra on pp. 217-19.  But 'Essence of Mind' is tathata,
which can also be translated Essence of all things.  These indeed are not
different, as the essence of things can be grasped only by mind; cf.
Lankavatara Sutra 61-64, p. 155.  For more on the Mahayana doctrine of the
Trikaya, the Buddha's three bodies: cf. p. 650; Lotus Sutra 16, p. 121;

God said to Elijah... "Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord." And
behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and
broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind;
and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and
after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the
fire a still small voice.

             13. Judaism and Christianity.  Bible, 1 Kings 19.11-12

God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.
The parable of His Light
is as if there were a Niche,
and within it a Lamp;
the Lamp enclosed in Glass:
The glass as it were a brilliant star:
Lit from a blessed Tree,
An Olive neither of the East nor of the West,
Whose oil is well-nigh luminous,
though fire scarce touched it.
Light upon Light!
God guides whom He will to His Light:
God sets forth parables for men, and God knows all things.

                            14. Islam.  Qur'an 24.35

In the golden city of the heart dwells
The Lord of Love, without parts, without stain.
Know him as the radiant light of lights.

There shines not the sun, neither moon nor star,
Nor flash of lightning, nor fire lit on earth.
The Lord is the light reflected by all.
He shining, everything shines after him.

1 Kings 19.11-12: God is manifest in His Word, communicated to the heart. He is
not in the storm or the earthquake or other manifestations of power in nature.
This is a radical critique of nature-religion as it was practiced by the
Canaanites.  Qur'an 24.35: Islamic mystics since Ghazali have interpreted these
verses as expressing God's inner illumination of the human soul.  The Niche,
Glass, Lamp, Tree, and Oil correspond to the five faculties of the soul,
namely: (1) the sensory faculty; (2) the imagination; (3) the discriminative
intellect; (4) the faculty of ratiocination capable of abstract knowledge, and
(5) the transcendent prophetic spirit that may apprehend divine truth.  The
human soul is thus a graded succession of lights, 'Light upon light,' whose
source is God.  Cf. Katha Upanishad 2.3.7-8, p. 93.  Mumonkan 30: Compare "That
art thou," Chandogya Upanishad 6.8.7, p. 208.  But Mumonkan 33, p. 899, asserts
the seeming opposite !

That mind which gives life
To all the people
in the world
Such is the very mind
which nourishes me!

I am the nucleus of every creature, Arjuna; for without Me nothing can exist,
neither animate nor inanimate....  Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or
spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of My
essence.

                     19. Hinduism.  Bhagavad Gita 10.39, 41

At whose behest does the mind think?  Who bids the body live?  Who makes the
tongue speak?  Who is that effulgent Being that directs the eye to form and
color and the ear to sound?

The Self (Atman) is ear of the ear, mind of the mind, speech of speech.  He is
also breath of the breath, and eye of the eye.  Having given up the false
identification of the Self with the senses and the mind, and knowing the Self
to be Brahman, the wise, on departing this life, become immortal.

                      20. Hinduism.  Kena Upanishad 1.1-2

Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is not born, does not die, does not pass away to
become reborn.  The Tathagatagarbha excludes the realm with the characteristic
of the constructed.  The Tathagatagarbha is permanent, steadfast, eternal.
Therefore the Tathagatagarbha is the support, the holder, the base of
constructed [Buddha natures] that are nondiscrete, not dissociated, and knowing
as liberated from the stores of defilement; and furthermore is the support, the
holder, the base of external constructed natures that are discrete,
dissociated, and knowing as not liberated.

Lord, if there were no Tathagatagarbha, there would be neither aversion towards
suffering nor longing, eagerness, and aspiration towards Nirvana. What is the
reason?  Whatever be these six perceptions [i.e., the five senses plus the
mind], and whatever be this other perception [perhaps intellectual cognition?],
these seven natures are unfixed, momentary, and lack experience of suffering;
hence these natures are unfit for aversion towards suffering or for longing,
eagerness, and aspiration towards Nirvana. Lord, the Tathagatagarbha has
ultimate existence without beginning or end, has an unborn and undying nature,
and experiences suffering; hence it is worthy of the Tathagatagarbha to have
aversion towards suffering as well as longing, eagerness, and aspiration
towards Nirvana. Lord, the Tathagatagarbha is neither self nor sentient being,
nor soul, nor personality....  Lord, this Tathagatagarbha is the embryo of the
illustrious Dharmadhatu, the embryo of the Dharmakaya, the embryo of the
supramundane Doctrine, the embryo of the intrinsically pure Doctrine.

One Hundred Poems about the World: See note on p. 497.  Sun Myung Moon,
2-12-61: 'Heart' is the irrepressible impulse to love others, which is the
inner motivation for all God's actions.  In humans, heart lies at the root of
the mind, motivating intellect, emotion, and will.  In prayer one can touch the
heart of God and feel its affective aspect: joy when His beloved children
respond to Him and deep sorrow for those who are lost in sin.  Cf. Sun Myung
