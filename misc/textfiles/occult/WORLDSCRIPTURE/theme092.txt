
SYNERGY

       While Theravada Buddhism and Jainism regard progress toward
enlightenment as entirely a matter of individual effort, in the theistic
religions human efforts are undertaken in the context of God's grace.  The
relationship between effort and grace is what Thomas Aquinas called
synergy: effort calls forth grace, and grace prompts effort.  A number of
texts stress human initiative as calling forth grace--"God helps those who
help themselves"; conversely, others describe grace as preceding and
overshadowing human effort.  The concluding text describe the conjoint
action of human effort and divine providence, including the paradoxical
nature of their relationship.  For texts that regard salvation as by grace
alone, see Grace, pp. 505-12.

Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace.  But
if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you.

If you wish to find the true way,
Right action will lead you to it directly;
But if you do not strive for Buddhahood
You will grope in the dark and never find it.

In the Book of Changes it is said, "He is blessed by Heaven.  Good
fortune. Nothing that does not further."

The Master said, To bless means to help.  Heaven helps the man who is
devoted; men help the man who is true.  He who walks in truth and is
devoted in his thinking, and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by
Heaven. "He has good fortune, and there is nothing that would not further"
[Hexagram 42: Increase].

Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it
will be opened to you.  For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks
finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.  Or what man of you, if
his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?  Or if he asks for
fish, will give him a serpent?  If you, then, who are evil, know how to
give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in
heaven give good things to those who ask him!

                   Christianity.  Bible, Matthew 7.7-11


God has declared: I am close to the thought that My servant has of Me, and
I am with him whenever He recollects Me.  If he remembers Me in himself, I
remember him in Myself, and if he remembers Me in a gathering I remember
him better than those in the gathering do, and if he approaches Me by as
much as one hand's length, I approach him by a cubit....   If he takes a
step towards me, I run towards him.

the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.

For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own
doing, it is the gift of God--not because of works, lest any man should
boast.  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good
works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.

Lo! this is an admonishment, that whosoever will may choose a way unto his
Lord; yet you will not, unless God wills.  Lo! God is Knower, Wise.  He
makes whom He will to enter His mercy, and for evildoers has prepared a
painful doom.

O My servants, everyone of you is in error, except the one I have guided,

you is hungry, except him whom I have fed, so ask food of Me and I will
feed you.  O My servants, everyone of you is naked except him whom I have
clothed, so ask clothing of Me and I will clothe you.  O My servants, you
sin day and night, and I pardon your sins; so ask pardon of Me and I will

All undertakings in this world depend both on the ordering of fate and on
human exertion; but among these two the ways of fate are unfathomable; in
the case of man's work action is possible.

All by Thee is accomplished, Thine is the might,
Thou watcheth Thy handiwork,
With chess pieces raw and ripe.
All that into the world have come, must depart hence--
All shall by turns go.
Why put out of mind the Lord, master of life and death?
By one's own hands is one's affairs set straight.

             Sikhism.  Adi Granth, Asa-ki-Var, M.1, p. 473-74


Lord Mahavira!  Your word sometimes supports the view of providence, at
other times calls events spontaneously occurring or ascribes destiny to
external factors.  At times you hold the deeds of individuals to be the
mold of their desert, at other times find that another's deeds project
their moral reflection on the individual.  The miracle is that none blames
you for these paradoxical utterances!

Asa-ki-Var, M.1: The image of God in heaven moving chess pieces which
determine man's destiny on earth is evocative of absolute predestination.
Yet that is all the more reason to be mindful of God, Master of the game;
for who knows on what basis he decides his moves, or whether he will not
choose to move the pieces again?
