We are also planning a Thelemic camping trip "under the stars" in late 
July, as well as further initiations in August. In the meantime, we are 
fortunate to have a transmission, through the vechile of Frater Onan in 
Omnibus, of such a unique nature, we are considering the creation of a 
literature Class.

HYMN TO SPAM

"What is this stuff
That doth Jiggle in the breeze
and smells like that which
I avoid when I walk in the stables"
                 Hysterica of Estrus

O meaty mass of fleshy flesh
Who with the dark and wild
And wanton world doth mesh
In sizzling ecstacy, tasty and mild!

From Ellay to the halls of Priam,
To the Salty fields of Elysium,
Come to me, glorious Spam,
Thou cooked, broiled, and pressed ham!

Io Spam! Io Spam!
Come with eggs and toast,
With bacon and duckling roast,
Come wild! Come sliced!
Come mashed! Come diced!
Io Spam! Spam! Io! Io!

With this key thy veil I rend!
Thy starry blue tin I twist and bend!
That the thee in thee might
Become the ne in me tonight!

And the thee in me I feel
as the thee in me I peel;
With glee and abandon I stab
My trident into thy Quivering Flab!
Io Spam! Spam Io! Io! Io!

With fervor and awe you relent
Before my furious murderous intent;
I whip I mash I slash I cream
Thy body to consummate this dream.
Io Spam! Io Spam! Spam! Spam! Io! Io!

I dice I beat I flake I shake
I cover thee with Shake and Bake;
Spam! O Sweet Sweet Spam!
Never again will I slam my ham!
Io Spam! Io Spam! Io!
O yeah, Spam my baby...
Come to papa, Spam.
Oooooh....Spam...I never dreamed...
IIOOOOO!!SPAAAAAM!!!*
