                    FOR HE WILL CALL THE LEAVES IN THE FALL
                                       
                I rear my shaggy head, sleepy from my long rest
                                       
                         TO FLY THEIR COLORS BRIGHTLY
                                       
               to a challenge of spiced air and rattling breath
                                       
                    WHEN HEAT IS LOST HE PAINTS WITH FROST
                                       
           Clean cold gives me life and I rise and cry out with joy
                                       
                          HIS SILVER TOUCHES LIGHTLY
                                       
                            As his gaze caresses me
                                       
                   HE GREETS THE DAY IN THE DANCE OF THE MAY
                                       
   Desire stirs in me and I pull my limbs free of sleep and dance behind him
                                       
                         WITH RIBBONS ROUND ABOUT HIM
                                       
     I will color him with the rainbow and sprinkle stars before his feet
                                       
                    WE EAT THE CORN AND DRINK FROM HIS HORN
                                       
                   I will brew sweet mead to pour before him
                                       
                          WE WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT HIM
                                       
                      and my love will be the libation.

                   OH SHE WILL BRING THE BUDS IN THE SPRING
                                       
                 I am called from deepest tide to highest hill
                                       
                          AND LAUGH AMONG THE FLOWERS
                                       
         I fly on whisper's wing, careering to the sound of laughter.
                                       
                     IN SUMMER'S HEAT HER KISSES ARE SWEET
                                       
                  I will touch the sun and bring her its gold
                                       
                           SHE SINGS IN LEAFY BOWERS
                                       
                 To weave amongst the silver notes of the song
                                       
                    SHE CUTS THE CANE AND GATHERS THE GRAIN
                                       
         i am hers for the reaping, spilling my blood to give her life
                                       
                       WHEN FRUITS OF FALL SURROUND HER
                                       
             Becoming flesh with her flesh, body and body together
                                       
                      HER BONES GROW OLD AND WINTERY COLD
                                       
      When she draws into herself to prepare for the turning of the wheel
                                       
                        SHE WRAPS HER CLOAK AROUND HER
                                       
                                I will be there

                                                                      __ Shadow
