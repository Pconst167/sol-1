Title: A Picture of a Faith-Holder

@INTL 93:9609/0 93:9004/0
One of the most perceptive fiction writers of our time is Gordon R.
Dickson, originator of Dickson's Law, which I have found to be of
immense spiritual and practical value.

In his book, "The Final Encyclopedia", Dickson introduces and develops
the character of a Faith-Holder by the name of James Child-of-God,
second-in-command of a group of partisan warriors resisting the
Occupying Forces on the world of Harmony.

This is a fascinating character, as Dickson portrays him: a harsh old
man, who has spent his entire life fighting against those whom he
regards as the enemies of God.  Not of his world, but of God.  The
current leader of his command is a young woman he raised from childhood
while fighting and running and fighting again.

Child-of-God was married for two and a half years, before the militia
of the Occupying Forces killed his wife in a running battle.

Child-of-God is now an old man, and the command has been fleeing the local
militia for weeks.  Finally, the old man's constitution gives out, and
he elects to remain behind, while he still has the strength to give the
militia a fight that can delay them significantly in their pursuit of
the command.

The hero of the book, Hal Mayne, briefly stays behind to help set up
barricades and a field-of-fire for Child-of-God.  At this point, let's
take a look at these last moments in an old warrior's life:

<From "FINAL ENCYCLOPEDIA", by Gordon R. Dickson:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

"Go," said Child, without looking up at him.  "There's nothing more for
thee to do here.  Thy duty is at the Command."

Hal looked at him for a second more, then turned to go.

"Stop," Child said.

Hal turned back.  The older man was looking away from the firing aperture
and up at him.

"What is thy true name, Howard?"  Child asked.

Hal stared at him.

"Hal Mayne."

"Look at me, Hal Mayne," Child said.  "What dost thou see?"

"I see...." Hal ran strangely out of words.

"Thou seest," said Child, in a stronger voice, "one who has served the
Lord God all his life in great joy and triumph and now goeth to that
final duty which by divine favor is his alone.  Thou wilt tell the
Command and Rukh Tamanni this, in just those words, when thou returnest
to them.  Thou wilt testify exactly as I say?"

"Yes," said Hal.  He repeated the message Child had given him.

"Good," said Child.  He lay gazing at Hal for a seond longer.  "Bless
thee in God's name, Hal Mayne.  Convey to the others that in God's
name, also, I bless the Command and Rukh Tamanni and all who fight or
shall fight under the banner of the Lord.  Now go.  Care for those
whose care is in your hands."

He turned to fix his eyes once more on the forest as seen through the
firing slot in his barricade.  Hal turned away also, but in a different
direction, leaving James Child-of-God upon a small rise in a rain-
saddened wood, awaiting his enemies--solitary, as he had always been;
but also, as he had always been, not alone.

Thus Gordon R. Dickson's description of a Christian Faith-Holder and
a Christian warrior--well done.
