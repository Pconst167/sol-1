Introduction
     
     The belief that there is a connection between satanism and 
crime is certainly not new.  In fact, one of the oldest theories 
of crime causation is demonology.  Heightened concern about 
satanic or occult activity has appeared periodically throughout 
history.  Concern in the late 1970s focused primarily on 
"unexplained" deaths and mutilations of animals, and in recent 
years has focused on child sexual abuse and the human sacrifice of 
missing children.  In 1999 it will probably focus on the impending 
"end of the world."
     Today, satanism and a wide variety of other terms are used 
interchangeably in reference to certain crimes.  This discussion 
will analyze the nature of "satanic, occult, ritualistic" crime 
and focus on appropriate LAW ENFORCEMENT responses to it.
     Recently a flood of law enforcement seminars and conferences 
have dealt with the occult.  These training conferences have 
various titles, such as "Occult in Crime," "Satanic Cults," 
"Ritualistic Crime Seminar," "Satanic Influences in Homicide," 
"Occult Crimes, Satanism and Teen Suicide," and "Ritualistic Abuse 
of Children."
     The typical conference runs from one to three days and often 
includes many of the same presenters and instructors.  A wide 
variety of topics are usually discussed during this training 
either as individual presentations by different instructors or 
grouped together by one or more instructors.  Typical topics 
covered include the following:

     1.  Historical overview of satanism, witchcraft, and paganism 
         from ancient to modern times.
     2.  Nature and influence of fantasy role-playing games, such 
         as Dungeons and Dragons.
     3.  Lyrics, symbolism, and influence of rock and roll, Heavy 
         Metal, and Black Metal music.
     4.  Teenage "stoner" gangs, their symbols, and their 
         vandalism.
     5.  Teenage suicide by adolescents dabbling in the occult.
     6.  Crimes committed by self-styled satanic practitioners to 
         include grave and church desecrations and robberies, 
         animal mutilations, and even murders.
     7.  Ritualistic abuse of children as part of bizarre 
         ceremonies and human sacrifices.
     8.  Organized, Traditional, or Multigenerational satanic 
         groups involved in organized conspiracies, such as taking 
         over day care centers, infiltrating police departments, 
         and trafficking in human sacrifice victims.
     9.  The "Big Conspiracy" theory, which implies that satanists 
         are responsible for such things as Adolph Hitler, World 
         War II, abortion, pornography, Watergate, Irangate, and 
         infiltration of the Department of Justice, the Pentagon 
         and the White House.

     During the conference, these nine areas are linked together 
through the liberal use of the word "satanism" and some common 
symbolism (pentagrams, 666, demons, etc.).  The implication often 
is that all are part of one continuum of behavior, one big problem 
or some common conspiracy.  The information presented is a mixture 
of fact, theory, opinion, fantasy, and paranoia, and because some 
of it can be proven or corroborated (desecration of cemeteries, 
vandalism, etc.), the implication is that it is all true and 
documented.  The distinctions between the different areas are 
blurred even if occasionally a presenter tries to make them.  This 
is complicated by the fact that almost any discussion of satanism 
and witchcraft plugs into the religious belief systems of those in 
the audience.  Faith, not logic and reason, controls the 
religious beliefs of most people.  As a result, some normally 
skeptical law enforcement officers accept the information 
disseminated at these conferences without critically evaluating 
it or questioning the sources.  Little said at such conferences 
will change the religious beliefs of the attendees.  Such 
conferences illustrate the ambiguity and wide variety of terms 
involved in this issue.


Definitions

     The words satanic, occult, and ritualistic are often used 
interchangeably.  It is difficult to precisely define Satanism 
(with a capital S), and no attempt will be made to do so here.  
However, it is important to realize how the word satanism (with a 
small s) is used by many people.  Simply put, for some people, 
satanism is any religious belief system other than their own.  The 
Ayatolla Khomeini referred to the United States as the "Great 
Satan."  In the British Parliament, a Protestant leader called the 
Pope the anti-Christ.  In a book titled prepare For War, the 
author, Rebecca Brown, M.D., has a chapter entitled "Is Roman 
Catholicism Witchcraft?"  Dr. Brown also lists among the 
"doorways" to satanic power and/or demon infestation the 
following:  fortune tellers, horoscopes, fraternity oaths, 
vegetarianism, yoga, self-hypnosis, relaxation tapes, acupuncture, 
biofeedback, fantasy role-playing games, adultery, homosexuality, 
pornography, judo, karate, and rock music.  Dr. Brown states that 
the rock music "was a carefully masterminded plan by none other 
than Satan himself."  The ideas expressed in this book may seem 
extreme and even humorous.  This book, however, has been listed as 
serious recommended reading in law enforcement training material 
on this topic.

     In books, lectures, handout material, and conversations, the 
author has heard all of the following referred to as satanism:

Church of Satan       Stoner Gangs       New Age
Ordo Templi Orientis  Heavy Metal Music  Astrology
Temple of Set         Rock Music         Channeling
Demonology            KKK                Transcendental Meditation
Witchcraft            Nazis              Holistic Medicine
Paganism              Scientology        Buddhism
Santeria              Unification Church Hinduism
Voodoo                The Way            Mormonism
Rosicrucians          Hare Krishna       Islam
Freemasonry           Rajneesh           Orthodox Church
Knights Templar       Religious Cults    Roman Catholicism

     At law enforcement training conferences, witchcraft, 
santeria, and paganism are frequently referred to as forms of 
satanism.  It may be a matter of definition, but these three
things are *not* forms of traditional Satanism.  The worship of
lunar goddesses and nature and the practice of fertility rituals
is not satanism.  Santeria is a combination of 17th century Roman 
Catholicism and African paganism.  The occult simply refers to the 
action or influence of supernatural powers or some secret 
knowledge of them, and it is not the same as Satanism nor is it 
necessarily evil.
     Many individuals define satanism from a totally Christian 
perspective, using this word to describe the power of evil in the 
world.  With this definition, any crimes, especially those which 
are particularly bizarre, repulsive, or cruel, can be viewed as 
satanic in nature.  Yet, it is just as difficult to precisely 
define satanism as it is to precisely define Christianity or any 
complex spiritual belief system.


What is Ritualistic Crime?

     The biggest confusion, however, is over the word ritualistic.  
During law enforcement training conferences on this topic, 
ritualistic almost always comes to mean satanic or at least 
spiritual.  Ritual can refer to a prescribed religious ceremony, 
but in its broader meaning refers to any customarily repeated act 
or series of acts.  The need to repeat these acts can be cultural, 
sexual, or psychological as well as spiritual.
     Cultural rituals could include such things as what a family 
eats on Thanksgiving Day or when and how presents are opened at 
Christmas.  The initiation ceremonies of fraternities, sororities, 
gangs, and other social clubs are other examples of cultural 
rituals.
     Since 1972, the author has lectured about sexual ritualism, 
which is nothing more than repeatedly engaging in an act or series 
of acts in a certain manner because of *sexual* need.  In order to 
become aroused and/or gratified, a person must engage in the act 
in a certain way.  This sexual ritualism can include such things 
as the physical characteristics, age, or gender of the victim, the 
sequence of acts, the bringing or taking of specific objects, and 
the use of certain words or phrases.  This is more than the 
concept of M.O. (Method of Operation) known to most police 
officers.  M.O. is something done by an offender because of a 
need.Deviant acts, such as urinating on, defecating on, or even 
eviscerating a victim, are far more likely to be the result of 
sexual ritualism than religious or "satanic" ritualism.
     From a criminal investigative perspective, two other forms of 
ritualism must be recognized.  The Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R) defines Obsessive- 
Compulsive Disorder (OCD) as "repetitive, purposeful, and 
intentional behaviors that are performed in response to an 
obsession, or according to certain rules or in a stereotyped 
fashion."  Such compulsive behavior frequently involves rituals.  
Although such behavior usually involves noncriminal activity such 
as excessive hand washing or checking that doors are locked, in 
some cases this compulsive ritualism can be part of criminal 
activity.  Ritual can also stem from psychotic hallucinations and 
delusions.  A crime can be committed in a precise manner because a 
voice told the offender to do it that way or because a divine 
mission required it.
     To make this more confusing, cultural, religious, sexual, and 
psychological ritualism can overlap.  Some psychotic people engage 
in excessive religiosity and hear the voice of God or Satan 
telling them to do things of a religious nature.  Psychopathic 
offenders who feel little, if any, guilt over their crimes may 
need little justification for their antisocial behavior.  As human 
beings, however, they may have fears, concerns and anxiety over 
getting away with their criminal acts.  It is difficult to pray to 
God for success in doing things that are against His Commandments.  
A negative spiritual belief system may fulfill their human need 
for assistance from and belief in a greater power.  Compulsive 
ritualism (e.g. excessive cleanliness or fear of disease) can be 
introduced into sexual behavior.  Even many "normal" people have a 
need for order and predictability and therefore may engage in 
family or work rituals.  Under stress or in times of change, this 
need for order and ritual may increase.
     Ritualistic crime may fulfill the cultural, spiritual, sexual 
and psychological needs of an offender.  The ritual behavior may 
also fulfill basic criminal needs to manipulate victims, get rid 
of rivals, send a message to enemies, and intimidate co- 
conspirators.
     The important point for the criminal investigator is to 
realize that most criminal ritualistic behavior is not motivated 
simply by satanic or religious ceremonies.  At some conferences, 
presenters have attempted to make a big issue of distinguishing 
between "ritual," "ritualized," and "ritualistic" abuse of 
children.  These subtle distinctions, however, seem to be of no 
significant value to the criminal investigator.


What is Ritualistic Abuse of Children?

     It is not an easy question to answer.  Most people today use 
the term to refer to abuse of children that is part of some evil 
spiritual belief system, which almost by definition must be 
satanic.
     Dr. Lawrence Pazder, author of 'Michelle Remembers, defines 
ritualized abuse of children as "repeated physical, emotional, 
mental, and spiritual assaults combined with a systematic use of 
symbols and secret ceremonies designed to turn a child against 
itself, family, society, and God."  He also states that "the 
sexual assault has ritualistic meaning and is not for sexual 
gratification."
     This definition may have value for academics, sociologists, 
and therapists, but it creates potential problems for law 
enforcement.  Certain acts engaged in with children (kissing, 
touching, appearing naked, etc.) may be criminal if performed for 
sexual gratification.  If the ritualistic acts were in fact 
performed for spiritual indoctrination, potential prosecution can 
be jeopardized.  The mutilation of a baby's genitals for sadistic 
sexual pleasure is a crime.  The circumcision of a baby's genitals 
for religious reasons is most likely NOT a crime.  The intent of 
the acts is important for criminal prosecution.
     The author has been unable to precisely define ritualistic 
abuse and prefers not to use the term.  It is confusing, 
misleading, and counterproductive.  Certain observations, however, 
are important for investigative understanding.
     Not all spiritually motivated ritualistic activity is 
satanic.  Santeria, witchcraft, voodoo, and most religious cults 
are not satanism.  In fact, most spiritually or religiously-based 
abuse of children has nothing to do with satanism.  Most child 
abuse that could be termed ritualistic by various definitions is 
probably physical and psychological rather than sexual in nature.
     Not all such ritualistic activity with a child is a crime.  
Almost all parents with religious beliefs indoctrinate their 
children into that belief system.  Is circumcision for religious 
reasons child abuse?  Does having a child kneel on a hard floor 
reciting the rosary constitute child abuse?  Does having a child 
chant a satanic prayer or attend a black mass constitute child 
abuse?  Does a religious belief in corporal punishment constitute 
child abuse?  Does group care of children in a commune or cult 
constitute child abuse?   Does the fact that any acts in question
were performed with parental permission affect the nature of the 
crime?  Many ritualistic acts, whether satanic or not, are simply 
not crimes.
     When a victim describes and investigation corroborates what 
sounds like ritualistic activity, several possibilities must be 
considered.  The ritualistic activity may be part of the excessive 
religiosity of a mentally ill, psychotic offender.  It may be a 
misunderstood part of sexual ritualism.  The ritualistic activity 
may be incidental to any real abuse.  The offender may be involved 
in ritualistic activity with a child and also may be abusing a 
child, but one may have little or nothing to do with the other.
     The offender may be deliberately engaging in ritualistic 
activity with a child as part of child abuse.  The motivation, 
however, may be not to indoctrinate the child into a belief 
system, but to lower the inhibitions of, to control and 
manipulate, and/or to confuse the child.  In all the turmoil over 
this issue, it would be a very effective strategy for any child 
molester to deliberately introduce ritualistic elements into his 
crime to confuse the child and therefore the criminal justice 
system.
     The ritualistic activity and the child abuse may be integral 
parts of some spiritual belief system.  In that case, the greatest 
risk is to the children of the practitioners.  But this is true of 
all cults, not just satanic cults.  A high potential of abuse 
exists for any children raised in a group isolated from the 
mainstream of society, especially if the group has a charismatic 
leader whose orders are unquestioned and blindly obeyed by the 
members.  Sex, money, and power are most often the main 
motivations of the leaders of such cults.


What Makes a Crime Satanic, Occult, or Ritualistic?

     Some would answer that it is the spiritual beliefs of, or 
the membership in, a cult or "church" by the perpetrator.  If that 
is the criteria, why not label the crimes committed by 
Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in the same way?  Are the 
atrocities of Jim Jones, in Guyana, Christian crimes?
     Some would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols 
in the possession or home of the perpetrator.  What does it mean 
then to find a crucifix, Bible, rosary, etc., in the home or 
possession of a bank robber, embezzler, child molester, or 
murderer?  If different criminals possess the same symbols, are 
they necessarily part of one big conspiracy?
     Others would answer that it is the presence of certain 
symbols such as pentagrams, inverted crosses, and 666 at the crime 
scene.  What does it mean then to find a cross spray painted on a 
wall or carved into the body of a victim?   What does it mean for 
a perpetrator to leave a Bible tied to his murder victim?  What 
about the possibility that an offender deliberately left such 
symbols to make it look like a "satanic" crime?
     Some would argue that it is the bizarreness or cruelness of 
the crime: body mutilation, amputation, drinking of blood, eating 
of flesh, use of urine or feces.  Does this mean that all 
individuals involved in lust murder, sadism, anthropophagy, 
urophilia, and coprophilia are satanists or occult practitioners?  
What does this say about the bizarre crimes of psychotic killers 
such as Ed Gein or Richard Trenton Case, both of whom mutilated 
their victims as part of their psychotic delusions?
     A few might even answer that it is the fact that the crime 
was committed on a date with satanic or occult significance 
(Halloween, May Eve, etc.) or the fact that the perpetrator claims 
that Satan told him to commit the crime.  What does this mean for 
crimes committed on Thanksgiving or Christmas?  What does this say 
about crimes committed by perpetrators who claim that God or Jesus 
told them to do it?  One note of interest is the fact that in 
handout and reference material collected by the author, the number 
of dates with satanic or occult significance ranges from 8 to 110.  
This is compounded by the fact that it is sometimes stated that 
satanists can celebrate these holidays on several days on either 
side of the official date or that the birthday of a practitioner 
can be a holiday.  The exact names and exact dates of the 
holidays and the meaning of symbols listed may also vary depending 
on who prepared the material.  The handout material is often 
distributed without identifying the author or documenting the 
original source of the information.  It is then frequently 
photocopied by attendees and passed on to other police officers 
with no one really knowing who says it is valid or from where it 
came.
     Most, however, would probably answer that what makes a crime 
satanic, occult, or ritualistic is the motivation for the crime.  
It is a crime that is spiritually motivated by a religious belief 
system.  How then do we label the following true crimes?

     a.  Parents defy a court order and send their children to an 
         unlicensed Christian school.
     b.  Parents refuse to send their children to any school 
         because they are waiting for the second coming of Christ.
     c.  Parents beat their child to death because he or she won't 
         follow their Christian beliefs.

     d.  Parents violate child labor laws because they believe the 
         Bible requires such work.
     e.  Individuals bomb an abortion clinic or kidnap the doctor 
         because their religious belief system says abortion is 
         murder.
     f.  A child molester reads the Bible to his victims in order 
         to justify his sex acts with them.
     g.  Parents refuse life-saving medical treatment for a child 
         because of their religious beliefs.
     h.  Parents starve and beat their child to death because 
         their minister said the child was possessed by demonic 
         spirits.

     Some people would argue that the Christians who committed the 
above crimes misunderstood and distorted their religion while 
satanists who commit crimes are following theirs.  But who decides 
who is misinterpreting a religious belief system?  The individuals 
who committed the above-described crimes believed that they were 
following their religion as they understood it.  Religion was and 
is used to justify such things as the Crusades, the Inquisition, 
Apartheid, segregation, violence in Northern Ireland, India, and 
Lebanon.
     Who decides exactly what "satanists" believe?  In this 
country, we can't agree on what Christians believe.  At many law
enforcement conferences 'The Satanic Bible' is used for this, and 
it is often contrasted or compared with the Christian Bible.  'The 
Satanic Bible' is, in essence, a 150-page paperback book written 
by one man in 1969.  To compare it to a book written by over 30 
authors over a period of thousands of years is ridiculous, even 
ignoring the possibility of Divine revelation in the Christian 
Bible.  What satanists believe certainly isn't limited to other 
peoples' interpretation of a few books.  More importantly, it is 
subject to some degree of interpretation by individual believers 
just as Christianity is.
     The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been 
committed in the name of God, Jesus, and Mohammed than has ever 
been committed in the name of Satan.  Most people don't like that 
statement, but few can argue with it.
     Although defining a crime as satanic, occult, or ritualistic 
would probably involve a combination of the criteria set forth 
above, the author has been unable to clearly define such a crime.  
Each potential definition presents a different set of problems 
when measured against an objective, rational, and constitutional 
perspective.  Each offender in a group may have a different 
motivation for the crime.  The author has discovered that the 
*facts* of so called "satanic crimes" are often significantly 
different from what is described at law enforcement training 
conferences or in the media.  The actual involvement of satanism 
or the occult in these cases usually turns out to be secondary, 
insignificant, or nonexistent.


The Law Enforcement Perspective

     The perspective with which one looks at satanic, occult,
or ritualistic crime is extremely important.  Sociologists, 
therapists, religious leaders, parents, and just plain citizens 
each have their own valid concerns and views about this issue.  
This discussion, however, will deal ONLY with the law enforcement 
perspective.
     The law enforcement perspective must focus on crime and 
clearly recognize that just because an activity is "satanic" does 
not necessarily mean it is a crime or that it is not a legitimate 
religious practice protected by the First Amendment.  Within the 
personal religious belief system of a law enforcement officer, 
Christianity may be good and satanism evil.  Under the 
Constitution, however, both are neutral.
     This is an important, but difficult, concept for many law 
enforcement officers to accept.  They are paid to uphold the 
Constitution and enforce the penal code, not the Ten Commandments.  
The apparent increasing numbers of teenagers and some adults 
dabbling in satanism and the occult may be cause for concern for 
parents, school officials, and society.  What, however, law 
enforcement can or should do about it is another matter.  Police 
interference with free exercise of constitutional rights 
potentially creates major problems and conflicts.
     What is the justification for law enforcement officers giving 
presentations on satanism and the occult to citizen groups, PTA's 
or school assemblies?  Is it public relations, a safety program, 
crime prevention?  If it is crime prevention, how much crime can 
be linked to satanic or occult activity?  The author is not 
suggesting that such presentations should never be done but only 
that law enforcement agencies should carefully consider the legal 
implications and the justification.  Is the fact that satanism or 
the occult is or can be a negative influence on some people enough 
justification for such law enforcement intervention?
     When you combine an emotional issue such as the sexual abuse 
of children with an even more emotional issue such as people's 
religious beliefs, it is difficult to maintain objectivity and 
remember the law enforcement perspective.  Some police officers 
may even feel that all crime is caused by evil, all evil is caused 
by Satan, and therefore, all crime is satanic crime.  This may be 
a valid religious perspective, but it is of no value in the 
investigation of crime.
     Many of the police officers who lecture on satanic or occult 
crime do not even investigate such cases.  Their presentations are 
more a reflection of their personal religious beliefs than 
documented investigative information.  In the United States, they  
are entitled to this personal perspective, but introducing 
themselves as police officers and then speaking as religious 
advocates causes confusion.  As difficult as it might be, police 
officers must separate the religious and law enforcement 
perspectives when they are lecturing or investigating in their 
official capacities as law enforcement officers.  Many law 
enforcement officers begin their presentations by stating that 
they are not addressing or judging anyone's religious beliefs, and 
then proceed to do exactly that.
     Some police officers have resigned rather than curtail or 
limit their involvement in this issue as ordered by their 
departments.  Maybe such officers deserve credit for recognizing 
that they could no longer keep the perspectives separate.
     Law enforcement officers who believe that the investigation 
of satanic/occult crime puts them in conflict with supernatural 
forces of evil should probably not be assigned to these cases.  
If, however, such officers must be or are assigned, they will need 
the power of their own spiritual belief system in order to deal 
with the superstition and religious implications of these cases.  
The religious beliefs of officers should provide spiritual 
strength and support for them, but not affect the objectivity and 
professionalism of the investigation.
     The law enforcement perspective requires avoiding the 
paranoia that has crept into this issue and into some of the law 
enforcement training conferences.  Paranoia is characterized by 
the gradual development of an intricate, complex, and elaborate 
system of thinking based on and often proceeding logically from 
misinterpretation of an actual event.  It typically involves 
hypervigilance over the perceived threat, the belief that danger 
is around every corner, and the willingness to take up the 
challenge and do something about it.  Another very important 
aspect of this paranoia is the belief that those who do not
recognize the threat are evil and corrupt.  In this extreme view, 
you are either with them or against them.  You are either part of 
the solution or part of the problem.
     Concern over satanic crime and ritualistic abuse of children 
is a very polarizing issue.  After one presentation on this topic, 
a student wrote in a critique that the author was obviously an 
"agnostic cultist."  The term "clean" is sometimes used to refer 
to law enforcement officers who have not been infiltrated by the 
satanists.  Does the fact that some police officers or military 
personnel practice satanism or paganism mean that law enforcement 
and the military have been infiltrated?  The word "infiltrated" 
is only used when talking about an unpopular spiritual belief 
system.  Protestants, Catholics, and Jews don't "infiltrate" the 
police and military.
     Overzealousness and exaggeration motivated by the religious 
fervor of those involved in law enforcement training is more 
acceptable than that motivated by ego and profit.  Some people are 
deliberately distorting and hyping this issue for personal 
notoriety and profit.  Satanic and occult crime has become a 
growth industry.  Speaking fees, books, video and audio tapes, 
prevention material, television and radio appearances all bring 
ego and financial rewards.
     Law enforcement officers must be objective fact finders.  It 
is not their job to *believe* the children.  It is their job to 
*listen* to the children.  THe law enforcement perspective can't 
ignore the lack of physical evidence (no bodies or even hairs, 
fibers, or fluids left by violent murders); the difficulty in 
successfully committing a large-scale conspiracy crime (the more 
people involved in any crime conspiracy, the harder it is to get 
away with it); and human nature (intragroup conflicts resulting in 
individual self-serving disclosures are bound to occur in any 
group involved in organized kidnapping, baby breeding and human 
sacrifice).  When and if members of a destructive cult commit 
murders, they are bound to make mistakes, leave evidence, and 
eventually make admissions in order to brag about their crimes or 
to reduce their legal liability.
     Bizarre crime and evil can occur without organized satanic 
activity.  The law enforcement perspective requires that we 
distinguish between what we know and what we're not sure of.

     The facts are:
     a.  Some individuals believe in and are involved in satanism 
         and the occult.
     b.  Some of these individuals commit crime.
     c.  Some groups of individuals share this belief and
         involvement in satanism and the occult.
     d.  Some of these groups commit crime together.
     The unanswered questions are:
     a.  What is the connection between the belief system and the 
         crimes committed?
     b.  Is there some organized conspiracy of satanic and occult
         believers responsible for inter-related serious crime
         (e.g., molestation, murder)?

     After all the hype and hysteria is put aside, the realization 
sets in that most satanic/occult activity involves the commission 
of NO crimes, and that which does, usually involves the commission 
of relatively minor crimes such as trespassing, vandalism, cruelty 
to animals, or petty thievery.  The law enforcement problems most 
often linked to satanic or occult activity are:

     1.  Vandalism
     2.  Desecration of churches and cemeteries
     3.  Thefts from churches and cemeteries
     4.  Teenage gangs
     5.  Animal mutilations
     6.  Teenage suicide
     7.  Child abuse
     8.  Kidnapping
     9.  Murder and human sacrifice

     Valid evidence shows some "connection" between satanism and 
the occult and the first six problems set forth above.  The 
"connection" to the last three problems is far more uncertain.
     Even in those areas where there seems to be a "connection," 
the nature of the connection needs to be explored.  The author's 
experience indicates that involvement in satanism and the occult 
is a justification for crime, not a motivation for crime.  A 
teenager's excessive involvement in satanism and the occult is 
usually a symptom of a problem and not the cause of a problem.  
Blaming satanism for a teenager's vandalism, theft, suicide, or 
even act of murder is oversimplifying a complex problem.
     The law enforcement investigator must objectively evaluate 
the legal significance of any criminal's spiritual belief system.  
In most cases, including those involving satanists, it will have 
little or no legal significance.  If a crime is committed as part 
of a spiritual belief system, it should make no difference which 
belief system it is.  The crime is the same whether a child is 
abused or murdered as part of a Christian, Hare Krishna, Moslem, 
or any other belief system.  We generally don't label crimes with 
the name of the perpetrator's religion.  Why then are the crimes 
of child molesters, rapists, sadists, and murderers who happen to 
be involved in satanism and the occult labeled as satanic or 
occult crimes?  If criminals use a spiritual belief system to 
rationalize and justify or to facilitate and enhance their 
criminal activity, should the focus of law enforcement be on the 
belief system or on the criminal activity?
     Several documented murders have been committed by individuals 
involved in one way or another in satanism or in the occult.  In 
some of these murders, the perpetrator has even introduced 
elements of the occult (e.g., satanic symbols at crime scene).  
Does that automatically make these satanic murders?  It is the 
author's opinion that the answer is no.  Ritualistic murders 
committed by serial killers or sexual sadists are not necessarily 
satanic or occult murders.Ritualistic murders committed by psychotic killers who hear the voice
of satan are no more satanic murders than murders committed by
psychotic killers who hear the voice of Jesus are Christian murders.
     Rather, a satanic murder can be defined as one committed by 
two or more individuals who rationally plan the crime and whose 
PRIMARY motivation is to fulfill a prescribed satanic ritual 
calling for the murder.  By this definition, the author has been 
unable to identify even one documented satanic murder in the 
United States.  Although such murders may have and can occur, they 
appear to be few in number.  In addition, the commission of such 
killings would probably be the beginning of the end for such a 
group.  It is highly unlikely that they could continue to kill 
several people, every year, year after year, and not be 
discovered.
     A brief typology of satanic and occult practitioners is 
helpful in evaluating criminal activity.  The following typology 
is adapted from the investigative experience of Officer Sandi 
Gallant of the San Francisco Police Department, who began to study 
the criminal aspects of occult activity long before it became 
popular.  No typology is perfect, but the author uses this 
typology because it is simple and offers investigative insights.  
The typology divides satanic practitioners into three categories.  
Practitioners in any of these three categories can participate in 
satanic/occult activity alone or in groups.

     1.  Youth Subculture -- Most teenagers involved in fantasy 
         role-playing games, heavy metal music, or satanism and 
         the occult are going through a stage of adolescent 
         development and commit no significant crimes.  The 
         teenagers who have more serious problems are usually 
         those from dysfunctional families or those who have poor
         communication within their families.  These troubled 
         teenagers turn to satanism and the occult to overcome a 
         sense of alienation, to obtain power and/or to justify 
         their antisocial behavior.  For these teenagers, it is 
         the symbolism, not the spirituality, that is important.
         It is either the psychopathic or the oddball, loner
         teenager who is the most likely to get into serious
         trouble.  Extreme involvement in the occult is a
         symptom of a problem, not the cause.  This is not to
         say, however, that satanism and the occult isn't a
         strong negative catalyst for a troubled teenager.
         Probably the worst thing, however, that society
         could do about this problem is to hysterically warn
         teenagers to avoid this "mysterious, powerful and
         dangerous" thing called satanism.  This approach
         will drive many teenagers right to it.  Some
         rebellious teenagers will do whatever will most
         shock and outrage society in order to flaunt their
         rejection of society.

     2.  Dabblers (Self-styled) - For these practitioners,
         there is little or no spiritual motivation.  They
         mix satanism, witchcraft and paganism.  Symbols mean
         whatever they want them to mean.  Molesters,
         rapists, drug dealers and murders may dabble in
         the occult and may commit their crimes in a
         ceremonial or ritualistic way.  This category has
         the potential to be the most dangerous, and most of
         the "satanic" killers fall into this category.
         Again, this extreme involvement in satanism and the
         occult is a symptom of a problem and a rationalization 
         and justification of antisocial behavior.  Satanic/occult 
         practices (as well as those of other spiritual belief 
         systems) can be used as a mechanism to facilitate
         criminal objectives.

     3. Traditional (Orthodox, Multigenerational) - These are
        the true believers.  They are usually very careful of
        outsiders.  Because of constitutional issues, such
        groups are difficult for law enforcement to penetrate.
        Although there is much we don't know about these groups,
        as of now there is little or no hard evidence that they
        are involved in serious, organized criminal activity.
        In addition, instead of being self-perpetuating master
        crime conspirators, true believers probably have a
        similar problem with their teenagers rebelling against
        their belief system.

     Many police officers ask what to look for during the search 
of the scene of suspected satanic activity.  The answer is simple: 
look for evidence of a crime.  A pentagram is no more criminally 
significant than a crucifix unless it corroborates a crime or a 
criminal conspiracy.  If a victim's description of the location or 
the instruments of the crime includes a pentagram, then the 
pentagram would be evidence.  But the same would be true if the 
description included a crucifix.  In spite of what is sometimes 
said or suggested at law enforcement training conferences, police 
have no authority to seize any satanic or occult paraphernalia
they might see during a search.  A legally valid reason must exist 
for doing so.  It is not the job of law enforcement to prevent 
satanists from engaging in noncriminal beliefs or rituals.


Conclusions

     There must be a middle ground in this issue.  Concern about 
satanic or occult activity should not be a big joke limited to 
religious fanatics.  On the other hand, law enforcement is not now 
locked in a life-and-death struggle against the supernatural 
forces of ancient evil.  Law enforcement officers need to know 
something about satanism and the occult in order to properly 
evaluate their possible connections to the motivations for 
criminal activity.  They must know when and how beliefs, symbols, 
and paraphernalia can be used to corroborate criminal activity.  
From a community relations perspective, they must also learn to 
respect spiritual beliefs that may be different or unpopular but 
that are not illegal.  The focus must be on the objective 
investigation of violations of criminal statutes.
     Until hard evidence is obtained and corroborated, the 
American people should not be frightened into believing that 
babies are being bred and eaten, that 50,000 missing children are 
being murdered in human sacrifices, or that satanists are taking 
over America's day care centers.  No one can prove with absolute 
certainty that such activity has NOT occurred.  The burden of 
proof, however, as it would be in a criminal prosecution, is on 
those who claim that it has occurred.  As law enforcement agencies 
evaluate and decide what they can or should do about satanic and 
occult activity in their communities, they might want to also 
consider how to deal with the hype and hysteria of the "anti- 
satanists."  The overreaction to the problem can clearly be worse 
than the problem.
     In general, the law enforcement perspective can best be 
maintained by investigators repeatedly asking themselves what they 
would do if the acts in question were part of Protestant, Catholic 
or Jewish activity.  If a law enforcement agency wants to evaluate 
the group spiritual framework within which a crime is committed, 
it is more appropriate, accurate, and objective to refer to such 
crimes as cult crimes rather than as satanic, occult, or 
ritualistic crimes.  The "Sects, Cults and Deviant Movements" 
seminar put on by The Institute of Police Technology and 
Management at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, 
Florida, is a good example of this more objective, broad-based 
approach.  Satanic cults have no more law enforcement significance 
than many other potentially destructive cults that exist in this 
country.
