BIDE YE WICCAN LAWS YE MUST         NINE WOODS IN THE CAULDRON GO        
IN PERFECT LOVE AND PERFECT TRUST   BURN THEM FAST AND BURN THEM SLOW    
                                                                         
LIVE YE MUST AND LET TO LIVE        ELDER BE THE LADY'S TREE             
FAIRLY TAKE AND FAIRLY GIVE         BURN IT NOT OR CURSED YE'LL BE       
                                                                         
CAST THE CIRCLE THRICE ABOUT        WHEN THE WHEEL BEGINS TO TURN        
TO KEEP UNWELCOME SPIRITS OUT       LET THE BELTANE FIRES BURN           
                                                                         
TO BIND THE SPELL WELL EVERY TIME   WHEN THE WHEEL HAS TURNED A YULE     
LET THE SPELL BE SPAKE IN RHYME     LIGHT THE LOG THE HORNED ONE RULES   
                                                                         
SOFT OF EYE AND LIGHT OF TOUCH      HEED YE FLOWER, BUSH AND TREE        
SPEAK YE LITTLE AND LISTEN MUCH     BY THE LADY BLESS`D BE               
                                                                         
DEOSIL GO BY THE WAXING MOON        WHERE THE RIPPLING WATERS GO         
CHANTING OUT THE WICCAN RUNE        CAST A STONE AND THE TRUTH YE'LL KNOW
                                                                         
WIDDERSHINS GO BY THE WANING MOON   WHEN YE HAVE AND HOLD A NEED         
CHANTING OUT THE BANEFUL TUNE       HARKEN NOT TO OTHER'S GREED          
                                                                         
WHEN THE LADY'S MOON IS NEW         WITH A FOOL NO SEASON SPEND          
KISS THE HAND TO HER TIMES TWO      NOR BE COUNTED AS HIS FRIEND         
                                                                         
WHEN THE MOON RIDES AT HER PEAK     MERRY MEET AND MERRY PART            
THEN THY HEART'S DESIRE SPEAK       BRIGHT THE CHEEK AND WARM THE HEART  
                                                                         
HEED THE NORTH WIND'S MIGHTY GALE   MIND THE THREEFOLD LAW YE SHOULD     
LOCK THE DOOR AND TRIM THE SAIL     THREE TIMES BAD AND THREE TIMES GOOD 
                                                                         
WHEN THE WIND COMES FROM THE SOUTH  WHEN MISFORTUNE IS ENOW'             
LOVE WILL KISS THEE ON THE MOUTH    WEAR THE STAR UPON THY BROW          
                                                                         
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM THE WEST   TRUE IN LOVE MUST YE EVER BE         
DEPARTED SOULS WILL SAFELY REST     LEST THY LOVE BE FALSE TO THEE       
                                                                         
WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM THE EAST   THESE EIGHT WORDS THE REDE FULFILL   
EXPECT THE NEW AND SET THE FEAST    "AN YE HARM NONE, DO WHAT YE WILL."
