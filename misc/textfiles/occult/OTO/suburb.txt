Living here in Northern Massachusetts, home of the supposedly
open minded folk of the East coast and spending my spare time
running a Pagan BBS, I thought we were comfortably far off from
the recent media blitzs of National tv, the Christian Networks
and the recent controversey in CA with the OTO. Then I opened
up the local sales-flyer paper we get each week, The Minuteman
Chronicle Sunday, circulation of 101,672 in the Lowell/Billerica
region, to a blood Dripping headline:

        Satan in The Suburbs

To one side was the green blobed quote:

       "Look at me, Satan's Child. Born
        of evil, thus defiled. Brought to
        Life through satanic birth. Come
        look at me and I'll show you
        things that will open your eyes...."
          Fron the song 'Possesed' by the group Venom.

Blazened in spectacular four color newsink, were a listing of
Symbols:
    An Anhk (labeled as Egyptian ANCH Cross, and with a
           sidelabeling of 'The Cross of Satan represents Life')
    A Peace Symbol (labeled as The Cross Of Neri, and with a
           sidelabeling of 'Cross upside down with the arms
           broken')
    A Dagger, upright (labeled as 'The Sword of power' and a
           sidelabeling of 'Aggressive force used in Satanic
           rituals')

This in a local shoppers flyer, distributed for free to all the
homes in the area (Oct. 29th, 1989 date on issue) that usually
has local town meeting results, real estate ads and the weeks
grocery coupons - in otherwords no real hard news or 'bad news'!
Mouth agape I read on... 2 full pages of the paper's worth of
print (in a paper of only 36 pages, 22 of which are fully ads)
claiming expose, local devil worshipers suspected, how to id a
devil worshiper etc...My stomache turned at their misinformation
and obvious madness of all this.
   THis area supports an ADF proto-Grove, a Wiccan Group, the
college is about to allow the formation of a Pagan STudents Group
and two very visbile (media wise) Masonic Temples, and a population
that is less than 50% Christian (We have in the area a large
immigrant population from the Orient which sport their own beliefs
and places of worship). This sort of 'reporting' should not even
begin to be visible here...
   I want people here, and thru the Nets, to see the sort of
material thats showing up, and see why we must start pulling our
groups and selves together into a true feeling of community and
protect ourselves before we are all destroyed seperatley or
forced to do as was done before and slip back into the shadows
to hide from these fanatics....My next few posts will be from
this paper, which is published by Beacon Communications, 20 Main
ST., Acton MA 01720, editor Bill Lindsay. If anyone wants to help
sway them by writing to the editorial department, they insist you
send them full address info and a phone number you can be reached
thru. Perhaps a flood of letters from us each time the media does
this sort of thing will help bring some changes....

       SATAN IN THE SUBURBS
by Elizabeth Banks, Senior Reporter

Alchol and drug abuse is no surprise in area high schools, but
police are now confronted with troublesome evidence of satanism
in some suburban communities.
   Dead animals in Acton, graffiti in Maynard, heavy metal music
blaring themse of Satan and the occult - all these are evidence
of cults and devil worship, say area police.
   But, there are signs parents can look for, and some teens are
more susceptible than others to the rituals of satanic worship,
according to Wesley Simons, director of Burlington's Community
Life Center, a teen counseling center.
   Teenagers most prone to satanism, Simmons said in a recent
interview, are those who have no close relationship with either
family members or friends. And, he added, "These are angry kids."
   Anger and isolation are the two characteristics, Simons stated,
"that predispose an association withh angry acts."
   Another sign, SImmons warned, is involvement with "Overtly
satanic acts" such as the use of symbols, rituals, animal killings,
reading occult books, listening to heavy metal music, and 
sometimes, playing the fantasy game "Dungeons and Dragons."
   "Emotional factors feed this behhavior," Simmons stressed. If
the emotional problems are not present, he added, teenagers may
just "dabble" with the symbolism of satanism such as the satanic
alphabet, heavy metal music, or related games.
   Even with strong close relationships heavy involvement could
happen, Simmons said, but "most likely it won't happen."
   Cult practices and satanism are not limited too teenagers,
police say. Because satanic acts are performed in secrecy police
often lack concrete evidence of criminal acts. However, police
now say that abducted childeren or runaways may be victims of
satanic rituals used as a guise for sexually abusing children.
   One case, reported last March by Lowell police, involved a
cult of local 13 and 14 year-olds. Two members reportedly drove
two recruits to a New York town where they were subjected to 
satanic rituals involving bloodletting and animal sacrifices.
   In other suburban communities police report evidence of satanic
worship ranging from graffiti on buildings depicting satanic
symbols to shrines in wooded areas, to animal mutilations. While
most incidents go no further than graffiti and are perceived as
harmless, there are enough isolated incidents of more serious
activities to concern police in some towns.
   "Its here," said Inspector Ken Duane, Chelmsfords juvenile
officer, simply said "We have no actual documented facts, but we've
found little shrines in the woods with rocks and candles." There
was also one isolated incident of a mutilated dog he said.
   Duane reports dealing with teenagers involved in satanic
activites, but extreme involvement does not take place "to a huge
degree. Police," he added "definately see a connection between
drug use and satanic worship. Anyone on drugs is capable of
anyuthing."

[Continued from last post]
 
   Recently, there was "talk" of organizing a satanic group
between Chelmsford and Tyngsboro teens, Duane said. But police
managed to break up the groups and "get some of the leaders
off the streets."
   "We also see a connection between Heavy metal music and
drugs," he stated. "These kids wear black T-shirts with Satanic
symbols," Duane said.
   In Chelmsford, as in many other suburban communities, satanic
graffiti is evident throughout the town. Police, Duane said, do
not know id it should be taken seriously, or if teens"are just
fooling around."
   Acton police also report signs of satnaic activity. Suspicions
began when animals began disappearing and mutilated animals were
discovered. But none of this, police say, could be directly
related to satanic activity.
   Again, while no direct proof exists, graffiti is presently
located at ACton-Boxborough Regional Hhigh School depicting the
numbers 666, the sign of Satan. In other areas of town, police
have located upside down crosses.
   In Burlington, Simmons reports counseling two local teens
involved in satanism. While he believs neither was seriously
involved, one was "into" "Dungeons and Dragons".
   There are also reports of suspicious graffiti in Billerica,
Lexington and Maynard.
   The Rev. Gary Heikkila of Maynard's Mission Evangelical Church
began investigating satanism after receiving a "strange letter".
This letter, he said, "talked about finding a mutilated animal
in the Gardner area and otehr things that seemed far out, but
worthy oof investigation."
   Convinced that many Christians are ignorant of Satanic worship.
Heikkila spoke with cult experts in preperation for a speech
which he would later deliver to the Maynard Community.
   Through his research, Heikkila said he learned "that Satanism
is much more than Halloween. These people have violent impulses
that prey upon angry, powerless people who lead secret lives and
are attracted to heavy metal music," he said.
   "I'm convinced that satanisim is linked to pornography, child
abuse and murder," Heikkila stressed.
   Further study of satanic worship put Heikkila in touch with a
cult expert in Dallas. "Various types of satanism are on a 
meteoric rise," he was told. "Satanism is predicted to be the
cult of the 90's," he added.
   THrough his church, Heikkila said a local woman came to him
and said she found paraphernalia involved in satanic worship in her
grand-daughter's closet. And, he learned of covens meeting in
Boxboro.
   "There are definately telltale signs," Heikkila continued.
Teenagers involved in satanism report keeping a "Book of Shadows".
These he explained contain suicide notes.
   Some young people, Heikkila cnotinued, are preoccupied with
death, while others have satanic symbols either tattoed or cut into
their skin with razors.
   Particularly troubling to Heikkila is the influence of the Church
of Satan, organized in California in 1966 by Anton Lavey, also
known as the Black Pope. This church, Heikkila said, "is amazing -
its almost like science fiction - but its very real."
     [Continued NEXT Post]

[Continued From Last Post]
 
Laveys teachings are "absolutely contrary to everything Christins
would accept." he continued. "(Lavey) teaches Satan is the best
friend the church has ever had."
   And, according to Heikkila, bookstores report Lavey's Satanic
Bible sells out shortly after shipments are received.
   Taking his research to Gardner, Heikkila made contact with a
musician from a heavy metal or black metal band. The band, he
said is involved in satanism and the music reflects it.
   Because Heikkila was disturbed by what he learned was 
happening in his own and surrounding communities, he delivered a 
speech about satanic worship. Shortly after, he reports, someone
attempted to burn down his church. During their investigation,
police found gasoline and matches next to the church building.
   While there is no proof that satanists were involved in the
arson attempt, Heikkila also reports receiving threatening 
letters.
   "I recieved some unsigned letters saying some terrible things
would happen," Heikkila said. "I would shudder to think about
them happening."
   Police urge anyone, whether a parent or concerned citizen, to
report signs of possibl satanic worship. In response to what is
seen as a growing national problem, an organization called BADD
(Bothered About Dungeons & Dragons) was founded in 1983 by Pat
Pauling, whose son killed himself after becoming involved in the
Fantasy game.
   The organization provides a reading and resource list as well
as information about preventive programs in "teen devil worship"
information can be obtained by writing BADD Inc PO Box 5513,
Richmond VA 23220.
   Additional information is available from the National Coalition
on TV Violance, c/o Thomas Radecki, MD PO BOX 2157, Champaign IL
61820.
   Locally anyone with information about cults or seeking 
information about cults and satanic worship may call the Cult
Victimization Hotline in Concord at (508) 369 5437.

   Theres more folks - this was just the largest of the articles,
all done up by the same reporter and the same sources of info as
mentioned herein....agains, maybe a real letter writing campaign
might help, not only to the paper, but to the organizations they
are plugging so they understand that we aren't satanists! Any other
suggestions are welcome too! I'll try to post a few more from this
batch of misinformed and unsubstantiated articles (with lots of
photos too - all of Graffitti for various rock groups including
Aerosmith! can't include these here,but they're not much to look
at).

SIGNS, SYMBOLS and SIGNIFICANT DATES
------------------------------------
By Elizabeth Banks, Senior Reporter
 
   As a tool in recogniziong and identifying possible satanic
behavior, a chart depicting satanic signs and symbols is available
from BADD INC or the National Coalition on Tv Violence.
   Also available is a list of satanic holidays and magic colors.

   According to these organizations signs of Satan include a
horned hand - the satanic salute - the numbers 666, the letters
FFF,or a lightning bolt. And Satan is sometimes written backwards
in "ancient writing" where 'A's are written as triangles.
   The traditional "peace sign" in satanism is the symbol of the
Cross of Neri. An upside down cross, often associated with Heavy
metal music, symbolizes a denial of Christianity.
   Another "common" symbol is a five pointed star. Two points
represent devil horns and the remaining three symbolize the denial
of the Christian Trinity.
   For members of covens, simple lines and arrows, often painted on
traffic signs, point the way to secret meetings. One area police
officer reports seeing such directional signals and several
suburban towns.
   Particularly appealing to some teenagers, are satanic alphabets
derived from the ancient runes. Using these alphabets, satanic
worships can communicate in secret.
   In satanism the most meaningful holiday is ones own birthday.
THis date is revered by other cult members.
   In order of importance other significant holidays are : 
Halloween (Oct 31) May Eve (April 30) the Summer Solstice (June 22)
and the Winter Solstice (Dec 22). One tehse days, police report
using extra surveillance for signs of satanic worship and rituals.
   Colors are also found to play a role in the occult. Black, often
the color of ceremonial robes, means darkness, sorrow, evil or the
devil. Red, symbolizing blood, can also mean energy, or physical
life. Green is a soothing color, depicting nature and vegitation.

******************************************************************
   And so the misinformation goes on. Is there any way to deal 
with this drivel legally? Its obnoxious, stirs the people up
against the wrong folk and is about as far off as they can get
from what satanists believe...
