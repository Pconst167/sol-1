                             THE SATANIC CREDO

                   We believe in one Prince,
                   Satan, Lord of this Earth
                   And in one Law,
                   Force and Fire,
                   Which Triumphs over all.

                   We believe in one Temple,
                   The Temple of Satan,
                   And in one word,
                   which triumphs over all,
                   The word of Ecstasy.

                   And we give praise to our Lord Satan,
                   The Flame-giver.

                   And look forward to his reign
                   And the pleasures that are to come!

                         Sanctus Satanas, Sanctus!
