psychologically immature and the emotionally unstable should not
attempt this! Those who refuse to face reality will most likely
wind up destroying themselves.

Prepare to surrender yourself to the will of the Aeon!

We will address the Prince of darkness in His original form as
"Set," Egyptian God of the Psyche. This allows the mystic an
untarnished appreciation of this most ancient and revered diety.
Once you begin to see "beneath the skin," the true nature of Satan
reveals Itself.

This is not a "formal" ritual--it is a meditative exercize.


Physical Preparations
=====================

The altar should be draped w/ a black cloth and the Pentagram of Set
should be present.

Place a chair in front of the altar, making sure that the pentagram
is at eye level. A sterno holds the Black Flame. Black candles can
provide additional light, but should be used sparingly.

Relax, while gazing into the pentagram, attempt to "project" your
consciousness into the symbol. Repeat these words - "I join with
Set."

Once you have convinced yourself that you are "there" mentally,
imagine yourself merging, becoming one with th personality behind
the symbol. With total self-confidence, keep asserting "I am Set!"
Chant it softly. Feel it. Believe it. Do this no more than an hour
or so.

Whe you are finished, put out the candles and go to bed. (The best
time for this is before sleeping.)

NOTE: It is up to the mage whether or not to banish. (Be careful!)
