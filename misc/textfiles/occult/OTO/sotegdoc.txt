                       SERVANTS OF THE ELDER GODS 

        SOTEG is formed for the purpose of promoting friendship,
ethicality, and brotherly/sisterly love between those who walk
nontraditional spiritual paths.  It is not intended to supplant any
other particular path, but to provide an alternative for those who
wish to form or participate in a support group of like minded people. 
It welcomes and encourages its membership participating with other
groups of similar, or at least non-contradictory paths.  It is even
conceivable that some of the SOTEG may call themselves "Christian,
Buddhist", etc.  A cornerstone of the SOTEG is a combination of
tolerance and acceptance of other Paths as valid for those who
participate in them with an adherence to the Wiccan Rede, and a
celebration of the mystery of "The descent of the Goddess".
1. All who desire to do so may call themselves a Servant of the Elder
   Gods.
2. Two or more people who call themselves SOTEG may form a group for
   whatever purpose they deem fit; i.e. Religious, Magical, Study,   
   etc.
3. Any group so formed, should name itself with a name indicative of
   its purpose; i.e. SOTEG study group of CO. Springs, for example, or
   SOTEG association of Mages, etc.
   a. The use of the word "Coven" is reserved for religious group use
      only.
4. Coven Organization
     a. A "Coven" is a group of the SOTEG organized for the purposes  
        of worshipping the Elder Gods and Goddesses in a balanced     
        manner, i.e. we of the SOTEG worship the Lord and Lady as a   
        balanced pair of Deities.
     b. A coven is considered to have met when such meeting was called
        by the currently elected Priest and Priestess calls such a     
        meeting and at least 50% of the members of the coven attend. 
        In no case shall a meeting be considered a gathering of the   
        Coven without at least three people present.
     c. Coven Officers will consist of at least three:  Priest,       
        Priestess, and Scribe.  Others may be elected as the need     
        arises by the general membership of Initiates.
     d. Within a consecrated Circle and during Ritual, the authority  
        of the Priestess and Priest is absolute.  Any other governance 
        of the Coven may require is by consensus of the members.
     e. After dedication, a student of SOTEG may participate in any    
        general Circle ritual held by the sponsoring Coven, and       
        special Circles by invitation of the Priest or Priestess      
        presiding.  In fact, such participation in celebration of     
        Sabats and Esbats should be encouraged as part of his training 
        and leading to his/her initiation into full membership of the 
        Coven, however a Dedicant has no voice in the daily governance 
        of the Coven. 
     f. After a suitable time of instruction decided by the Coven, a  
        Dedicant may be presented for Initiation to full Coven        
        membership.  After the receiving of the Coven Initiation, the 
        Initiate is eligible to vote in all matters of Coven          
        governance, and has all if the rights and responsibilities of 
        Coven membership.  An Initiate Can elect to remain (or become) 
        a Solitary Practitioner of the Craft at any time, providing   
        he/she gives written notice to the presiding Priest or        
        Priestess of the Coven and it is recorded by the Scribe of    
        said Coven.
     g. Any Initiate of the SOTEG can leave a Coven and start a new   
        Coven if they abide by the rules stated herein.
                       SERVANTS OF THE ELDER GODS (cont.) 
5. Ritual Observance
     a. Holidays
          The traditional eight holidays of Wicca will be observed at
          appropriate times, to be determined by the Coven involved;
          i.e. many celebrate Holidays on the "Closest" calendrical
          weekend, others select the Nearest Full Moon, etc.
     b. Esbats
          The selection of Esbat observance is left to the SOTEG coven
          concerned, and the convenience of it's membership.
     c. Dedication and Initiation
          A Dedication Ritual should be performed to indicate a
          students dedication to learning about the Craft and to
          introduce him/her to the Coven as a student, as well as to
          give them a taste of Circle Ritual and to prepare them for
          participation in Sabat Circles as a Dedicant.  An Initiation
          Ritual is to admit the Dedicant to Full Membership in the
          Coven, with all the Rights, Privileges, and Responsibilities
          appurtenant thereto.
     d. Ritual Sources
          SOTEG is based on an eclectic approach to Wiccan Worship,
          therefore, the approach to Ritual Sources, is "if it works
          use it, and if it doesn't work for you and /or your group
          don't use it".  These principles are , of course, to be
          applied within the framework of the principles of a balanced
          approach to worship of the Lord and Lady, the Wiccan Rede,
          and the utmost respect for your fellow Man.
6. There is no degree system or "hierarchy" involved in SOTEG, merely
   a recognition of individual "specialties", for those who desire   
   such recognition.  In other words, "Dedicant" and "Initiate" are   
   stages of development and not "degrees" per se.
     a.  Specialties currently recognized are:
       1. Priest or Priestess - indicating experience and ability in
          leading ritual on the eight Sabats and Circle worship
          at other times.  Recognition for this specialty is depen-
          dent on demonstrated ability by the individual concerned on
          at least one each of these occasions.  A group in need of
          one of this specialty may appoint someone as an "Acting"
          Priest or Priestess until such person becomes fully
          qualified. An "Acting" Priest or Priestess may be confirmed
          to this specialty, depending on Coven determination.
       2. Mage - indicating experience and ability in working
          Thaumaturgical magic and spell-work.  Recognition for this
          specialty is dependent on demonstrated ability by the
          individual concerned on at least three occasions.
       3. Healer - indicating experience and ability in working with
          healing of others, whether by magical/psychic means, herbal
          and naturopathic, medical, or other means.  This capability
          must be demonstrated either by a certificate of
          training/accomplishment (mundane methods such as first-aid,
          nursing, etc), or successful application upon at least three
          occasions.
       4. Counselor - Indicating expertise in interpersonal
          relationships and the healing of persons with psychological
          or social dysfunctions. This specialty is allowed only upon
          the documentation of three successes and the agreement of
          two others of the SOTEG in writing.

          the SOTEG.

          dedicants, proven by their acceptance and initiation.
     b. These specialties are listed as a requirement for a            
        "journeyman" status in those specialties and are a             
         recognition for Continuous practice in those specialties.     
         Some Covens may wish to grant a "Master" level to these       
         activities in recognition of exemplary service, expertise,    
         and knowledge for a period of five or more years in a        
         specialty.

                       The Charge of the Goddess 
 
Priestess: 
           Whenever  ye have need of any thing, once in the month, and 
     better  it  be  when  the moon is full, then shall ye assemble in 
     some  secret  place  and adore the spirit of She, who is Queen of 
     all  witches.  There  shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn 
     all  sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets; to these will 
     She teach things that are yet unknown.  And ye shall be free from 
     slavery;  and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall be naked 
     in  your  rites;  and ye shall dance, sing, feast, make music and 
     love,  all  in Her praise. For Hers is the ecstasy of the spirit, 
     and  Hers  also  is  joy  on  earth; for Her law is love unto all 
     beings. Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever towards it; let 
     naught  stop  you  or turn you aside. For Hers is the secret door 
     which opens upon the land of youth and Hers is the cup of wine of 
     life,  and  the cauldron of Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
     immortality.  She  is the gracious goddess, who gives the gift of 
     joy  unto the heart of man. Upon earth, She gave the knowledge of 
     the  spirit  eternal;  and  beyond  death,  She  gives  peace and 
     freedom,  and  reunion  with those who have gone before. Nor does 
     She  demand  sacrifice,  for  behold,  She  is  the mother of all 
     living, and Her love is poured out upon the earth. 
 
          She who is the beauty of the green earth, and the white moon 
     among the stars, and the mystery of the waters, and the desire of 
     the  heart of man, calls unto thy soul. Arise, and come unto Her. 
     For  She  is  the soul of nature, who gives life to the universe. 
     from Her all things proceed, and unto Her all things must return; 
     and before Her face, beloved of gods and men, let thine innermost 
     divine  self  be enfolded in the rapture of the infinite. Let Her 
     worship  be within the heart that rejoiceth; for behold, all acts 
     of  love and pleasure are Her rituals. And therefore let there be 
     beauty  and  strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, 
     mirth  and  reverence  within  you. And thou who thinkest to seek 
     Her,  know  thy  seeking and yearning shall avail thee not unless 
     thou  knowest  the  mystery; that if that which thou seekest thou 
     findest  not  within  thee,  then thou wilt never find it without 
     thee.  For behold, She has been with thee from the beginning; and 
     She is that which is attained at the end of desire.                            The Charge of the God 
Priest:    
       Listen to  the words  of the Horned God, the Guardian of all
        things wild  and free,  and Keeper  of the  Gates of  Death,
         whose Call all must answer:

                         I am the fire within your heart...
                             The yearning of your Soul.
                            I am the Hunter of Knowledge
                          and the Seeker of the Holy Quest
                       I - who stand in the darkness of light
                         am He whom you have called Death.
                     I - the Consort and Mate of Her we adore,
                                call forth to thee.
                             Heed my call beloved ones,
               come unto me and learn the secrets of death and peace.
                              I am the corn at harvest
                            and the fruit on the trees.
                            I am He who leads you home.
                                 Scourge and Flame,
                                 Blade and Blood -
                         these are mine and gifts to thee.

                          Call unto me in the forest wild
                                and on hilltop bare
                        and seek me in the Darkness Bright.
                             I - who have been called;
                                        Pan,
                                       Herne,
                                      Osiris ,
                                     and Hades,
                            speak to thee in thy search.
                                Come dance and sing;
                                come live and smile,
                                    for behold:
                                this is my worship.
                      You are my children and I am thy Father.
                                On swift night wings
                      it is I who lay you at the Mother's feet

                       The Charge of the Goddess 
 
Priestess: 
           Whenever  ye have need of any thing, once in the month, and 
     better  it  be  when  the moon is full, then shall ye assemble in 
     some  secret  place  and adore the spirit of She, who is Queen of 
     all  witches.  There  shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn 
     all  sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets; to these will 
     She teach things that are yet unknown.  And ye shall be free from 
     slavery;  and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall be naked 
     in  your  rites;  and ye shall dance, sing, feast, make music and 
     love,  all  in Her praise. For Hers is the ecstasy of the spirit, 
     and  Hers  also  is  joy  on  earth; for Her law is love unto all 
     beings. Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever towards it; let 
     naught  stop  you  or turn you aside. For Hers is the secret door 
     which opens upon the land of youth and Hers is the cup of wine of 
     life,  and  the cauldron of Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
     immortality.  She  is the gracious goddess, who gives the gift of 
     joy  unto the heart of man. Upon earth, She gave the knowledge of 
     the  spirit  eternal;  and  beyond  death,  She  gives  peace and 
     freedom,  and  reunion  with those who have gone before. Nor does 
     She  demand  sacrifice,  for  behold,  She  is  the mother of all 
     living, and Her love is poured out upon the earth. 
 
          She who is the beauty of the green earth, and the white moon 
     among the stars, and the mystery of the waters, and the desire of 
     the  heart of man, calls unto thy soul. Arise, and come unto Her. 
     For  She  is  the soul of nature, who gives life to the universe. 
     from Her all things proceed, and unto Her all things must return; 
     and before Her face, beloved of gods and men, let thine innermost 
     divine  self  be enfolded in the rapture of the infinite. Let Her 
     worship  be within the heart that rejoiceth; for behold, all acts 
     of  love and pleasure are Her rituals. And therefore let there be 
     beauty  and  strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, 
     mirth  and  reverence  within  you. And thou who thinkest to seek 
     Her,  know  thy  seeking and yearning shall avail thee not unless 
     thou  knowest  the  mystery; that if that which thou seekest thou 
     findest  not  within  thee,  then thou wilt never find it without 
     thee.  For behold, She has been with thee from the beginning; and 
     She is that which is attained at the end of desire.                            The Charge of the God

                            I am the Hunter of Knowledge
                          and the Seeker of the Holy Quest
                       I - who stand in the darkness of light
                         am He whom you have called Death.

                                call forth to thee.

                            I am He who leads you home.

                                and on hilltop bare
                        and seek me in the Darkness Bright.

                                        Pan,
                                       Herne,

                            speak to thee in thy search.
                                Come dance and sing;
                                come live and smile,
                                    for behold:
                                this is my worship.
                      You are my children and I am thy Father.
                                On swift night wings
                      it is I who lay you at the Mother's feet
                         to be reborn and to return again.
                            Thou who thinks to seek me,
                          know that I am the untamed wind,
                    the fury of storm and passion in your Soul.
                          Seek me with pride and humility,
                      but seek me best with love and strength.
                                For this is my path,
                        and I love not the weak and fearful.
                         Hear my call on long Winter nights
                   and we shall stand together guarding Her Earth

                            Tool Blessing Ritual 

A purification of objects for ritual use and their transformation into
magical items.  [The area is prepared by placing a quantity of each element
in the proper quarter, as well as preparing the altar in the usual way. If
available, a cauldron (empty) is placed in the center of the circle. 
Candles are placed at each of the four corners and lit, progressing deosil
from the east.  Salt and water are blessed, and the celebrants are purified
with them. A magic circle is cast, and watchtowers summoned.  The god is
then drawn down as follows: 

[The priest stands before the alter in the Osiris position, arms crossed
across chest and feet together.  The Priestess kneels before him with face
and arms upraised.] 

PS:  Hephaestus, forger of magic,
     descend upon this the body of thy priest and servant,
     lend us the strength of your arms.
     Prometheus, shape of man,
     descend upon this the body of thy priest and servant,
     lend us your fire and foresight
     Morpheus, weaver of dreams,
     descend upon this the body of thy priest and servant,
     lend us your subtlety and vision

P:   I am he, the shape-god,
     forger, builder, artisan, smith.
     With strength and craft I form the world.

[The Priest helps the Priestess to rise, and she stands in the center of
the circle in the god position, extending her arms outward and down, palms
facing forward.  The Priest kneels before her with head bowed.]

P:   Clotho, spinner of the strand of life
     Descend upon this the body of thy priestess and servant.
     Lend us your wheel of making.
     Hecate, caster of spells,
     Descend upon this the body of thy priestess and servant.
     Lend us the power of your magic.
     Aphrodite, goddess of love,
     Descend upon this the body of thy priestess and servant.
     Grant us eros, philos, aristos, agape.  

PS:  I am she, the weaver-goddess,
     Painter, poet, sculptor, witch.
     With art and love I form the world.

[The priestess extends her hands to the priest, and helps him rise. The
priest cups both hands and scoops from the cauldron, then offers to the
priestess.]

P:   Drink now from the cauldron of Cerridwen, whose draughts bring
knowledge, peace, and life.
[The priestess sips from the cupped hands, after which the priest drinks.
The objects to be blessed are taken from the altar by the priest and moved
widdershins to the west quarter, and immersed in the water there.]

P:   Spirits of the west, in water born
     In cool waters cleanse these tools
     And wash from them all hurt and harm
     This I ask, this charge I lay,
     By oak and ash and bitter thorn.

[The objects are moved by the priestess to the south quarter and moved
above the flames there.]

PS:  Spirits of the south, in fire born
     In shining flames purify these tools
     And burn from them all impurities
     This I ask, this charge I lay,
     By oak and ash and bitter thorn.

[The objects are moved to the east quarter by the priest and moved through
the incense smoke.]

P:   Spirits of the east, in sweet air born
     In swirling winds polish these tools
     And sweep from them all phantasm and illusion
     This I ask, this charge I lay,
     By oak and ash and bitter thorn.

[The objects are moved to the altar by the priestess, and placed upon the
pentacle.]

Ps:  Spirits of the north, in cool earth born
     In mother earth ground these tools
     And take from them all spirits dark
     This I ask, this charge I lay,
     By oak and ash and bitter thorn.

[The person consecrating the tools now offers an impromptu or prepared
charge to the items, stating their purpose and mode of use.  They are then
taken up by the priestess and moved to the east quarter.]

PS:  Spirits of the east, from the bright air come,
     Fill these tools with the swirling energies of the whirlwind
     Make them float like the breeze
     Spirits of air, hearken unto me,
     As I do will, so more it be.
[The tools are now taken up by the priest and moved to the south quarter.]

P:   Spirits of the south, from wild fire come,
     Fill these tools with the burning energies of the flames
     Make them glow with bright fire
     Spirits of fire, hearken unto me,
     As I do will, so more it be.
[The tools are now taken up by the priestess and moved to the west
quarter.]

P:   Spirits of the west, from soothing water come,
     Fill these tools with the calming energies of the warm rain
     Make them flow like the tide
     Spirits of water, hearken unto me,
     As I do will, so more it be.
[The tools are now taken up by the priestess and moved to the altar.]

PS:  Spirits of the north, from firm earth come,
     Fill these tools with the ordering energies of the growing crops
     Make them flourish like grapes on the vine
     Spirits of earth, hearken unto me,
     As I do will, so more it be.

[The priest takes the tools from the altar and steps backwards. The
priestess stands at the altar facing south towards the priest. The priest
extends his right arm in parallel to the ground, between he and the
priestess, with the tools in his hand.]

P:   I am the god, ever desiring.  I am the stag in the woods,
     I am the sun in the noonday sky, I am the lover in the dark.
     I offer passion, strength, devotion, and the swiftness of the hunt.

[The priestess extends her right arm in like fashion, and places her hand
over that of the priest.]

PS:  I am the goddess, ever nurturing.
      I am the tempting beauty of the maid,
      I am the quiet strength of the mother,
      I am the infinite wisdom of the crone.
      I offer life, love, warmth, and the fruitfulness of the fields.
  
 
[Both step towards each other, and turn their hands and arms so the fingers
point upwards, and the palms facing their own chest, cupping the other's
palm between and holding the tools.  They clasp each other with their left
arms.]

P&PS: Male and female, yin and yang, light and dark, action and stillness.
      Apart we are forever incomplete, but together we form one.
      In our joining we are blessed.  In our union, the limitless energy
      of universe is released and captured here.
P:    As I do will
PS:   As I do will
P&PS: As we do will, so mote it be.

[The priest and priestess kiss, then release grasps.  If the number and
size of the tools precludes them being held in one hand simultaneously, the
latter charging section should be repeated for each.  The tools are
replaced on the altar.Cakes and wine are blessed and consumed, and a period
of relaxation and rest follows.  The watchtowers are then dismissed, and
the circle opened.

                           SOLITARY MOON RITE 
                    By: Ellen Reed, Coven of Sothistar

This rite may be used for either New or Full Moon.  The difference is in
your meditation and mental attitude in preparation.  Remember that the New
Moon is a time of outward work and thought, building to the peak which is
the Full Moon.  At  the Full Moon, you should be preparing to lessen the
outward flow of energy, bit by bit, until the period before New Mo on,
during which you are passive, building a pool of energy within you, in
preparation for the New Moon.

The altar should be placed in the center of the ritual area.  On it should
be placed a rose or stick of incense on the eastern side, a red votive
candle to the South; a cup of water on the West, and a bowl of salt or
living plant on the North.

Around your ritual area, you should place an unlighted candle at the
cardinal point of each direction.

To begin your rite, enter your darkened temple, carrying one burning
candle, white or lavender, with you.  Place it on the center of your altar,
sit, and meditate on the meaning of the rite.  When you feel the time is
right, stand, and go to the eastern point, carrying with you, the burning
taper.  Light the votive at the eastern point and go to the southern,
picturing, as you do, an arc of pure strong light curving from one candle
to the next.  Continue to the West, and then
 to the North, lighting the candles as you go, and then walk to your
eastern candle again, having formed a circle of pro tective light
surrounding the area in which you worship.

Return to the center of the circle, replace the candle on the altar, and
say:

My Lady of the Moon, who is called Diana, Artemis, Levanah, Isis and by any
other names, I come to you to bring you my love and my devotion.  May you
grant me the joy of your presence.

Mentally divide the room into four quadrants by visualizing a line of
silvery moonlight from the southeast to the northw est, and from the
northeast to the southwest.  Go the East, taking with you the rose or
incense.  Say:

Sweet Goddess, the gentle breeze is the touch of your loving hand, the wind
of storm a reminder of your strength.  The s ound of the trees in the wind
is your voice, and the fragrance of flowers borne on the wind is your gift
of beauty.

Place the rose next to the votive candle, then stand there as you picture
the quadrant filling with moonlight.  See the moonlight streaming quietly
and gently into the room, filling the quadrant
from center point to the edge of your circle.


When this is complete, take the red candle to the South.  Place the gift
and see the quadrant fill with moonlight.  Say:

Most loved Lady, the light of the candle is a guide along our path leading
to you; its warmth the reassurance of your presence and your love.  The
light of the Sun is the knowledge you impart to us, driving out ignorance
and those things which can survive only in darkness.

At the West:

Lovely One, the quiet pool is the serenity of your being.  The vast sea
where life began on this planet is the vast sea of your being whence all
life came; its waves are the ebb and flow of the universe you rule.

At the North:

Goddess of all, the fertility of the earth is a sign of your fertility,
whence all life rose.  The solidity and permanence are still of it are
still less than yours.  The Earth's fertility feeds our bodies, and your
fertility feeds our souls.

Go to the center of your temple, which is now filled with moonlight. 
Everything in the circle is touched by it, blessed by it, including you. 
Sit down and feel this moonlight around you.  Know that it is the Goddess. 
Realize that you are in the center of a sphere of light that is half above
and half above and half below where you sit.  Begin to breathe slowly and
evenly, deep breaths that penetrate your whole body.  When this rhythmic
breathing becomes natural, imagine that the moonlight by which you are
surrounded enters you, fills you entirely. 
With each exhalation of your breath, some of the essence of yourself leaves
your body, and with each inhalation, the light enters you.  You are being
filled ever so gently with this beautiful light.  This light, which is the
presence, the being of the Goddess, is within you as well as without.  With
each breath, you are less yourself and more the Goddess.

When you are filled with light, filled with the Goddess, the shell of your
body fades away.  You have no body; there is nothing to separate you from
the entire being of the Goddess.  Nothing exists but the being of which you
are apart.  You have ceased to be a separate entity.  You are nothing and
everything.  All that was, that is, and all that will be, you are.

Enjoy this feeling as long as you like.  When you feel it is time, picture
the outer shell of your physical body reformi ng, becoming solid again.  It
is being built out of the Universe of which you are a part. 
  
Now, as you continue your slow deep breathing, see the moonlight flowing
out of your body, as gently and slowly as it entered.  As it flows out,
realize there is a difference.  Because you have become one with the
Goddess, with the Universe, your being has changed.  As the moonlight flows
out of your body, it takes with it a part of that which was yourself, now
part of the Goddess, and leaves behind a part of the Goddess, forever now
part of you.  You become yourself again, 
solid as you were, but changed.  You are surrounded by the presence of the
Goddess, which now contains a part of yourself .

Move again to the East.  As you speak, and after, picture the moonlight in
that quadrant flowing back to its source, lea ving that quadrant as it was.

Do this at each quadrant, until all the moonlight has returned to the Moon.
At the East:

 My Lady, guide my thoughts.  Let them lead always closer to you.

At the South:

 Gracious Goddess, guide my actions.  Let them always help and never harm
others or myself.

At the West:

 Lovely One, guide my emotions:  Let them be healing and touched always by
you.

At the North:

 Sweet Goddess, let my mind always be fertile and storng, that I may grow
always toward you.

Return to the East to complete the circle and say:

Queen of Heaven, I thank you for your presence, both now and always.  My
love and devotion are yours.  Blessed be!

All spirits who have joined me tonight may depart, with my love. Return to
your proper places.

Walk again around your circle, but this time counterclockwise, extin-
guishing the quadrant guards as you go, and at the same time, mentally
erasing the white line which surrounded your circle.  When the candles are
out and the circle gone, rap on your altar and say:

The rite is ended.
