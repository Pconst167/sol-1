      I have begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangle, as thou
   knowest, upon the Scarlet Woman called Hilarion, as it was
   mysteriously foretold unto me in "The Book of the Law."  Now
   therefore that thou art come to the Age of Understanding, do
   thou give ear unto my Wisdom, for that therein lieth a simple
   and direct Way for every Man that he may attain to the End.
      Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual
   Experience and Perfection have no necessary connection with
   Advancement in our Holy Order.  But for each Man is a Path:
   there is a Constant, and there is a Variable.  Seek ever
   therefore in thy Work of the Promulgation of the Law to
   discover in each Man his own true Nature, that

   he may in due Season accomplish it not only for himself, but
   for all who are bound unto him.  There are very many for whom
   in their present Incarnations this Great Work may be
   impossible; since their appointed Work may be in Satisfaction
   of some Magical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or in
   Fulfilment of some Defect.  As is written:  Suum Cuique.
   (Jedem das Seine.)
      Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels, I yearn
   greatly towards thee, o my Son, and I strive strongly with my
   Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make plain thy Way before thee;
   and thus in many Chapters will I write for thee those things
   that may profit thee.
       Sis benedictus.

      Do thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the
   Holy Qabalah.  Know that herein the Relations between Numbers,
   though they be mighty in Power and prodigal of Knowledge, are
   but lesser Things.  For the Work is to reduce all other
   conceptions to these of Number, because thus thou wilt lay
   bare the very Structure of thy Mind, whose rule is Necessity
   rather than Prejudice.  Not until the Universe is thus laid
   naked before thee canst thou truly anatomize it.  The
   Tendencies of thy Mind lie deeper far than any Thought, for
   they are the Conditions and the Laws of Thought; and it is
   these that thou must bring to Nought.
      This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies thereof
   most awful, most sublime.  It is for the Great Souls to enter
   on this Rigour and Austerity.  To them the Gods themselves do
   Homage; for it is the Way of Utmost Purity.

      Know, son, that the true Principle of Self-Control is
   Liberty.  For we are born into a World which is in Bondage to
   Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, even as the Enemies to
   the Bed of Procrustes.  Each of us, as he grows, learns
   Repression of himself and his true Will.  "It is a lie, this
   folly against self.":  these Words are written in "The Book of""
   ""the Law".  So therefore these Passions in ourselves which we
   understand to be Hindrances are not part of our True Will, but
   diseased Appetites, manifest in us through false early
   Training.  Thus the Tabus of savage Tribes in such matter as
   Love constrain that True Love which is born in us; and by this
   Constraint come ills of Body and Mind.  Either the Force of
   Repression carries it, and creates Neuroses and Insanities; or
   the Revolt against that Force, breaking forth with Violence,
   involves Excesses and Extravagances.  All these Things are
   Disorders, and against Nature.  Now then learn of me the
   testimony of History and literature as a great Scroll of
   Learning.  But the Vellum of the Scroll is of Man's Skin, and

   its Ink of his Heart's Blood.

      The Fault, that is Fatality, in Love, as in every other
   Form of Will, is Impurity.  It is not the Spontaneity there-of
   which worketh Woe, but some Repression in the Environment.
      In the Fable of Adam and Eve is this great Lesson taught by
   the Masters of the Holy Qabalah.  For Love were to them the
   eternal Eden, save for the Repression signified by the Tree of
   the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Thus their Nature of Love was
   perfect; it was their Fall from that Innocence which drove
   them from the Garden.
      In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but family
   Feud, which imported nothing to that Love, was its Bane; and
   the Rashness and Violence of their Revolt against that
   Repression, slew them.
      In the pure Outrush of Love in Desdemona for Othello was no
   Flaw; but his Love was marred by his consciousness of his Age
   and his Race, of the Prejudices of his Fellows and of his own
   Experience of Woman-Frailty.

           {epsilon } GESTA DE AMORE.

      Now as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of Love, so
   also doeth History, and the Lesson is ever the same.
      Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were destroyed by
   the System of Repression in which they chanced to move.
      Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social
   Artificialities; and Paolo slain on account of Things external
   to his Love of Francesca.
      Then, per contra, Martin Luther, being a Giant of Will, and
   also the Eighth Henry of England, as a mighty King, bent them
   to overturn the whole World that they might have satisfaction
   of their Loves.
      And who shall follow them?  For even now we find great
   Churchmen, Statesmen, Princes, Dramamakers, and many lesser
   Men, overwhelmed utterly and ruined by the conflict between
   their Passions and the Society about them.  Wherein which
   Party errs is no matter of Moment for our Thought; but the
   Existence of the War is Evidence of Wrong done to Nature.

      Therefore, o my Son, be thou wary, not bowing before the
   false Idols and ideals, yet not flaming forth in Fury against
   them, unless that be thy will.
      But in this Matter be prudent and be silent, discerning
   subtly and with acumen the nature of the Will within thee; so
   that thou mistake not Fear for Chastity, or Anger for Courage.
   And since the fetters are old and heavy, and thy Limbs
   withered and distorted by reason of their Compulsion, do thou,
   having broken them, walk gently for a little while, until the
   ancient Elasticity return, so that thou mayst walk, run, and
   leap naturally and with Rejoicing.
      Also, since these Fetters are as a Bond almost universal,
   be instant to declare the Law of Liberty, and the full
   Knowledge of all Truth that appertaineth to this Matter; for
   if in this only thou overcome, then shall all Earth be free,
   taking its Pleasure in Sunlight without Fear or Phrenzy. Amen.

      Understand,o my Son, in thy Youth, these Words which some
   wise One, now nameless, spake of old; except ye become as
   little Children ye shall in no wise enter into the Kingdom of
   Heaven.  This is to say that thou must first comprehend thine
   original Nature in every Point, before thou wast forced to bow
   before the Gods of Wood and Stone that Men have made, not
   comprehending the Law of Change, and of Evolution Through
   Variation, and the independent Value of every living Soul.
      Learn this also, that even the Will to the Great Work may
   be misunderstood of Men; for this Work must proceed naturally
   and without Overstress, as all true Works.  Right also is that
   Word that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, and the
   violent take it by Force.  But except thou be violent by
   Virtue of thy true Nature, how shalt thou take it?  Be not as
   the Ass in the Lion's Skin; but if thou be born Ass, bear
   patiently thy Burdens, and enjoy thy Thistles; for an Ass
   also, as in the Fables of Apuleius and Matthaiss, may come to
   Glory in the Path of his own Virtue.

      Sayest thou (methinks) that here is a great Riddle, since
   by Reason of much Repression thou hast lost the Knowledge of
   thine original Nature?
      My son, this is not so; for by a peculiar Ordinance of
   Heaven, and a Disposition occult within his Mine, is every Man
   protected from this Loss of his own Soul, until and unless be
   be by Choronzon disintegrated and dispersed beyond power of
   Will to repair; as when the Conflict within him, rending and
   burning, hath made his Mind utterly desert, and his Soul
   Madness.
      Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost;
   though it be buried beneath a life-old midden of Repressions,
   for it persisteth vital within thee (is it not the true Motion
   of thine inmost Being?)  and for all thy conscious Striving
   cometh forth by Night and by Stealth in Dream and Phantasy.
   Now is it naked and brilliant, now clothed in rich Robes of
   Symbol and Hieroglyph; but always travelleth it with thee upon

   thy Path, ready to acquaint thee with thy true Nature, if thou
   attend unto its Word, its Gesture, or its Show of Imagery.

      Therefore deem not that thy lightest Fancy is
   insignificant.  Thy most unconscious Acts are Keys to the
   Treasure-Chamber of thine own Palace, which is the House of
   the Holy Ghost.  Consider well thy conscious Thoughts and
   Acts, for they are under the Dominion of thy Will, and moved
   in Accord with the Operation of thy Reason; this indeed is a
   necessary work, enabling to comprehend in what manner thou
   mayst adjust thyself to thine Environment.  Yet is this
   Adaptation but Defence for the most Part, or at the best
   Subterfuge and Stratagem in the Tactics of thy Life, with but
   an accidental and subordinate Relation to thy true Will,
   whereof by Consciousness and by Reason thou mayst be ignorant,
   unless by Fortune great and rare thou be already harmonized in
   thyself, the Outer with the Inner, which Grace is not common
   among Men, and is the Reward of previous Attainment.
      Neglect not simple Introspections, therefore; but give yet

   greater Heed unto those Dreams and Phantasies, those Gestures
   and Manners unconscious, and of undiscovered Cause, which
   betoken thee.

       {kappa } DE SOMNISS.                  {alpha } CAUSA PER
   ACCIDENS.


      As all diseases have two conjunct causes, one immediate,
   external and exciting, the other constitutional, internal, and
   predisposing, so it is with Dreams, which are Dis-Eases, or
   unbalanced States of Consciousness, Disturbers of Sleep as
   Thoughts are of Life.
      This exciting Cause is commonly of two kinds: videlicet,
   imprimis, the physical Condition of the Sleeper, as a Dream of
   Water caused by a shower without, or a Dream of Strangulation
   caused by a Dyspnoea, or a Dream of Lust caused by the seminal
   Congestions of an unclean Life, or a Dream of falling or
   flying caused by some unstable Equilibrium of Body.
      Secundo, the psychic condition of the Sleeper, the Dream
   being determined by recent Events in his Life, usually those
   of the Day previous, and especially such Events as have caused

   Excitement of Anxiety, the more so if they be unfinished or
   unfulfilled.
      But this exciting Cause is of a superficial Nature, as it
   were a Cloke or a Mask; and thus it but lendeth Aspect to the
   other Cause, which lieth in the Nature of the Sleeper himself.

     {kappa } DE SOMNIIS.                     {beta } CAUSA PER
   NATURAM.


      The deep, constitutional, or predisposing Cause of Dreams
   lieth within the Jurisdiction of the Will itself.  For that
   Will, being alway present, albeit (it may be) latent,
   discovereth himself when no longer inhibited by that conscious
   Control which is determined by Environment, and therefore oft
   times contrary to himself.  This being so, the Will declareth
   himself, as it were in a Pageant, and showeth himself thus
   apparelled, unto the Sleeper, for a Warning or Admonition.
   Every Dream, or Pageant of Fancy, is therefore a Shew of Will;
   and Will being no more prevented by Environment or by
   Consciousness, cometh as a Conqueror.  Yet even so he must
   come for the most Part throned upon the Chariot of the
   exciting Cause of the Dream, and therefore is his Appearance
   symbolic, like a Writing in Cipher, or like a Fable, or like a
   Riddle in Pictures.  But alway does he triumph and fulfil

   himself therein, for the Dream is a natural Compensation in
   the inner World for any Failure of Achievement in the outer.

   HORRORIS.

      Now then if in a Dream the Will be always triumphant, how
   cometh it that a Man may be ridden of the Nightmare?  And of
   this the true Explanation is that in such a case the Will is
   in Danger, having been attacked and wounded or corrupted by
   the Violence of some Repression.  Thus the Consciousness of
   the Will is directed to the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh
   comfort in an Externalisation, or shew, of that Antagonism.
   And because the Will is sacred, such dreams excite an Ecstacy
   or Phrenzy of Horror, Fear or Disgust.  Thus the true Will of
   Oedipus was toward the bed of Jocasta, but the Tabu, strong
   both by Inheritance and by Environment, was so attached to
   that Will that his Dream concerning his Destiny was a Dream of
   Fear and of Abhorrence, his Fulfilment thereof (even in
   Ignorance) a spell to stir up all the subconscious Forces of
   all the People about him, and his Realization of the Act a

   madness potent to drive him to self-inflicted Blindness and
   fury-haunted Exile.

      {mu } DE SOMNIIS.                         {delta } SEQUENTIS.


       Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will cannot err; for
   this is thine appointed course in Heaven, in whose order is
   Perfection.
      A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all
   Warnings; for it signifieth that thy Will, which is Thy Self
   in respect of its Motion, is in Affliction and Danger.  Thus
   thou must instantly seek out the Cause of that subconscious
   Conflict, and destroy thine Enemy utterly by bringing thy
   conscious Vigour as an Ally to that true Will.  If then there
   be a Traitor in the Consciousness, how much the more is it
   necessary for thee to arise and extirpate him before he wholly
   infect thee with the divided Purpose which is the first Breach
   in that Fortress of the Soul whose Fall should bring it to the
   shapeless Ruin whose Name is Choronzon!

       {nu } DE SOMNIIS.                     {epsilon } CLAVICULA.


      The Dream delightful is then a Pageant of the Fulfilment of
   the true Will, and the Nightmare a symbolic Battle between it
   and its Assailants in thyself.  But there can be only one true
   Will, even as there can be only one proper Motion in any Body,
   no matter of how many Forces that Motion be the Resultant.
   Seek therefore this Will, and conjoin with it thy conscious
   Self; for this is that which is written; "Thou hast no right
   but to do thy Will.  Do that, and no other shall say nay."
   Thou seest, o my Son, that all conscious Opposition to thy
   Will, whether in Ignorance, or by Obstinacy, or through Fear
   of others, may in the end endanger even thy true Self, and
   bring thy Star into Disaster.
      And this is the true Key to Dreams; see that thou be
   diligent in its Use, and unlock therewith the secret Chambers
   of thine Heart.

       Concerning they Travellings in thy Body of Light, or
   Astral journeys and Visions so-called, do thou lay this Wisdom
   to thy Heart, o my Son, that in this Practice, whether Things
   Seen and Heard be Truth and Reality, or whether they be
   Phantoms in the Mind, abideth this Supreme Magical Value,
   namely:  Whereas the Direction of such Journeys is consciously
   willed, and determined by Reason, and also unconsciously
   willed, by the true Self, since without It no Invocation were
   possible, we have here a Cooperation of Alliance between the
   Inner and the Outer Self, and thus an Accomplishment, at least
   partial, of the Great Work.
      And therefore is Confusion or Terror in any such Practice
   an Error fearful indeed, bringing about Obsession, which is a
   temporary or even it may be a permanent Division of the
   Personality, or Insanity, and therefore a defeat most fatal

   and pernicious, a Surrender of the Soul to Choronzon.

      Now, o my Son, that thou mayst be well guarded against thy
   ghostly Enemies, do thou work constantly by the Means
   prescribed in our Holy Books.
      Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his
   four Stations, for thereby thou doest affirm thy Place in
   Nature and her Harmonies.
      Neglect not the Performance of the Ritual of the Pentagram,
   and of the Assumption of the Form of Hoor-pa Kraat.
      Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by the
   Rite of the Gnostic Catholic Church, or that of the Phoenix.
      Neglect not the Performance of the Mass of the Holy Ghost,
   as Nature herself prompteth thee.
      Travel also much in the Empyrean in the Body of Light,
   seeking ever Abodes more fiery and lucid.
      Finally, exercise constantly the Eight Limbs of Yoga., And

   so shalt thou come to the End.

       And now concerning Meditation let me disclose unto thee
   more fully the Mystery of the Key of Dreams and Phantasies.
      Learn first that as the Thought of the Mind standeth before
   the Soul and hindereth its Manifestation in consciousness, so
   also the gross physical Will is the Creator of the Dreams of
   common Men, and as in Meditation thou doest destroy every
   Thought by mating it with its Opposite, so must thou cleanse
   thyself by a full and perfect Satisfaction of that bodily will
   in the Way of Chastity and Holiness which has been revealed
   unto thee in thy Initiation.
      This inner Silence of the Body being attained, it may be
   that the true Will may speak in True Dreams; for it is written
   that He giveth unto His Beloved in Sleep.

      Now know this also that at the End of that secret Way lieth
   a Garden wherein is a Rest House prepared for thee.
      For to him whose physical Needs of whatever Kind are not
   truly satisfied cometh a Lunar or physical Sleep appointed to
   refresh and recreate by Cleansing and Repose; but on him that
   is bodily pure the Lord bestoweth a Solar or Lucid Sleep,
   wherein move Images of pure Light fashioned by the True Will.
   And this is called by the Qabalists the Sleep of Shiloam, and
   of this doeth also Porphyry make mention mention, and Cicero,
   with many other Wise Men of Old Time.
      Compare, o my Son, with this Doctrine that which was taught
   thee in the Sanctuary of the Gnosis concerning the Death of
   the Righteous; and learn moreover that these are but
   particular Cases of an Universal Formula.

      My Son, if thou fast ahwile, there shall come unto thee a
   second State of physiological Being, in which is a delight
   passive and equable, without Will, a contentment of Weakness,
   with a Feeling of Lightness and of Purity.  And this is
   because the Blood hath absorbed, in its Need of Nutriment, all
   foreign Elements.  Such also is the Case with the Mind which
   hath not fed itself on Thought.  Consider the placid and
   ruminent Existence of such Persons as read little, are removed
   from worldy Struggle by some sufficient Property of small and
   unexciting Value, stably invested, and by Age and Environment
   are free from Passion.  They live, according to their own
   Nature, without Desire, and they oppose no Resistance to the
   Operations of Time.  Such are called Happy, and in their Way
   of Vegetable Life it is so; for they are free of any Poison.

                 {sigma } DE MOTU VITAE.


      Learn then, o my Son, that all Phenomena are the effect of
   Conflict, even as the Universe itself is a Nothing expressed
   as the Difference of two Equalities, or, an thou wilt, as the
   Divorce of Nuith and Hadith.  So therefore every Marriage
   dissolveth a more material, and createth a less material
   Complex; and this is our Way of Live, rising ever from Ekstacy
   to Ekstacy.  So then all high Violence, that is to say, all
   Consciousness, is the spiritual Orgasm of a Passion between
   two lower and grosser Opposites.  Thus Light and Heat result
   from the Marriage of Hydrogen and Oxygen; Love from that of
   Man and Woman, Dhyana or Ekstacy from that of the Ego and the
   non-Ego.
      But be thou well grounded in this Thesis corollary, that
   one or two such Marriages do but destroy for a Time the
   Exacerbation of any Complex; to deracinate such is a Work of

   long Habit and deep Search in Darkness for the Germ thereof.
   But this once accomplished, that particular Complex is
   destroyed, or sublimated for ever.

                    {tau } DE MORBIS SANGUINIS.


      Now then understand that all Opposition to the Way of
   Nature createth Violence.  If thine excretory System do its
   Function not at its fullest, there come Poisons in the Blood,
   and the Consciousness is modified by the conflicts or
   Marriages between the elements heterogeneous.  Thus if the
   Liver be not efficient, we have Melancholy; if the Kidneys,
   Coma; if the Testes or Ovaries, loss of Personality itself.
   Also, an we poison the Blood directly with Belladonna, we have
   Delirium vehement and furious; with Hashish, Visions
   phantastic and enormous; with Anhiolonium, Ekstacy of colour
   and what not; with diverse Germs of Disease, Disturbances of
   Consciousness varying with the Nature of the Germ.  Also with
   Ether, we gain the Power of analysing the Consciousness into
   its Planes; and so for many others.
      But all these are, in our mystical Sense, Poisons; that is,

   we take two Things diverse and opposite, binding them together
   so that they are compelled to unite; and the Orgasm of each
   Marriage is an Ekstacy, the Lower dissolving in the Higher.

                       {upsilon } DE CURSU AMORIS.


      I continue then,  o my son, and reiterate that this Formula
   is general to all Nature.  And thou wilt note that by repeated
   Marriage cometh Toleration, so the Ekstacy appeareth no more.
   Thus his half grain of Morphia, which first opened his Gates
   of Heaven, is nothing worth to the Self-poisoner after a Year
   of dayly Practice.  So too the Lover findeth no more Joy in
   Union with his Mistress, so soon as the original Attraction
   between them is satisfied by repeated Conjunctions.  For this
   Attraction is an Antagonism; and the greater this Antinomy,
   the more fierce the Puissance of the Magnetism, and the
   Quality of Energy disengaged by the Coition.
      Thus in the Union of Similars, as of Halogens with each
   other, is no strong Passion of explosive Force, and the Love
   between two Persons of the like Character and Taste is placid
   and without Transmutation to higher Planes.

      O my Son, how wonderful is the Wisdom of this Law of Love!
   How vast are the Oceans of uncharted Joy that lie before the
   Keel of thy Ship!  Yet know this, that every Opposition is in
   its Nature named Sorrow, and the Joy lieth in the Destruction
   of the Dyad.  Therefore, must thou seek ever those Things
   which are to thee poisonous, and that in the highest Degree,
   and make them thine by Love.  That which repels, that which
   disgusts, must thou assimilate in this Way of Wholeness.  Yet
   rest not in the Joy of the Destruction of each complex in thy
   Nature, but press on to that ultimate Marriage with the
   Universe whose Consummation shall destroy thee utterly,
   leaving only that Nothingness which was before the Beginning.
      So then the Life of Non-Action is not for thee; the
   Withdrawal from Activity is not the Way of the Tao; but rather
   the Intensification and making universal every Unit of thine
   Energy on every Plane.

      Go forth, o my Son, o Son of the Sun, rejoicing in thy

   from the crass to the subtle, from the coarse to the fine.
   Conquer every Repulsion in thy self, subdue every Aversion.
   Assimilate all Poison, for therein only is there Profit.  Seek
   constantly therefore to know what is painful and to cleave
   thereunto, for by Pain cometh true Pleasure.  Those who avoid
   Pain physical or mental remain little Men, and there is no
   Virtue in them.  Yet be thou ware lest thou fall into the
   Heresy which maketh Pain, and Self-sacrifice as it were Bribes
   to corrupt God, to secure some future Pleasure in an imagined
   After-life.  Nay, also of the other Part, fear not to destroy
   thy Complexes, thinking dreadfully thereby to lose the Power
   of creating Joy by their Distinction.  Yet in each Marriage be
   thou bold to affirm the spiritual Ardour of the Orgasm, fixing

      Say not then that this Way is contrary to Nature, and that
   in Simplicity of Satisfaction of thy Needs is perfection of
   thy Path.  For to thee, who hast aspired, it is thy Nature to
   perform the Great Work, and this is the final Dissolution of
   the Cosmos.  For though a Stone seem to lie still on a
   Mountain Top, and have no care, yet hath it an hidden Nature,
   a Task Ineffable and Stupendous; namely, to force its Way to
   the Centre of Gravity of the Universe, and also to burn up its
   Elements into the final Homogeneity of Matter.  Therefore the
   Way of Quiet is but an Illusion of Ignorance.  Whoever thou
   mayst be now, thy Destiny is that which I have declared unto
   thee; and thou art most fixed in the true Way when, accepting
   this consciously as thy Will, thou gathereth up thy Powers to
   move thy Self mightily within it.

      But, o my Son, although thine ultimate Nature be Universal,
   thine immediate Nature is Particular.  Thy Way to the Centre
   is not oriented as that of any other Being, and thine elements
   are no kin, but alien, to his.  For Shame!  Is it not the most
   transcendent of all the Wisdoms of this Cosmos, that no two
   Beings are alike?  Lo!  This is the Secret of all Beauty, and
   maketh Love not only possible, but necessary, between every
   Thing and every other Thing.  So then, lest thou in thine
   Ignorance take the false Way, and divigate, must thou learn
   thine own particular and peculiar Nature in its Relation to
   all others.  For though it be Illusion, it is by the true
   Analysis of Falsehoods that we are able to destroy them, just
   as the Physician must understand the Disease of his Patient if
   he is to choose the fitting Remedy.  Now therefore will I make
   yet more clear unto thee the Value of thy Dreams and

   Phantesies and Gestures of thine unconscious Body and Mind, as
   Symptoms of thy particular Will, and show thee how thy mayst
   come to their Interpretation.

      All Disturbances, o my Son, are Variations from
   Equilibrium; and just as thy conscious Thoughts, Words, and
   Acts are Effects of the Displacement of the conscious Will, so
   is it in the Unconscious.  For the most Part, therefore, all
   Dreams, Phantasies, and Gestures represent that Will
   subliminal; and if the physical Part of that Will be
   unsatisfied, its Utterance will predominate in all these
   automatic Expressions.  Do thou then note what Modifications
   thereof follow such Changes in the conscious Foundation of
   that Part of thy Will as thou mayst make in thy Experiments
   therewith, and thus separate, as sayeth Trismegistus, the fine
   from the coarse, Fire from Earth, or, as we may say, assign
   each Effect to its true Cause.  Seek then to perfect a
   conscious Satisfaction of every Part of that Will, so that the
   unconscious Disturbances be at last brought to Silence.  Then

   will the Residuum be as an Elixir clarified and perfected, a
   true Symbol of that other hidden Will which is the Vector of
   thy Magical Self.

      Learn moreover that thy Self includeth the whole Universe

   an Aggrandisement of that Self.  Yet the greater Part of this
   Universe is common Knowledge, so that thy Self is interwoven
   with other Selves, save for that Part peculiar to thy Self.
   And as thou growest, so also this peculiar Part is ever of
   less Proportion to the Whole, until when thou becomest
   infinite, it is a Quantity infinitesimal and to be neglected.
   Lo!  When the All is absorbed within the I, it is as if the I

      Of the Way of the Tao I have already written to thee, o my

   everything by doing nothing.  I will first have thee to
   understand that the Universe being as above said an Expression
   of Zero under the Figure of the Dyad, its Tendency is
   continually to release itself from that strain by the Marriage
   of Opposites whenever they are brought into Contact.  Thus thy
   true Nature is a Will to Zero, or an Inertia, or Doing
   Nothing; and the Way of Doing Nothing is to oppose no Obstacle
   to the free Function of that true Nature.  Consider the
   Electrical Charge of a Cloud, whose Will is to discharge
   itself in Earth, and so release the Strain of its Potential.
   Do this by free conduction, there is Silence and Darkness;
   oppose it, there is Heat and Light, and the Rending asunder of
   that which will not permit free Passage to the Current.

   the Stress.  If thou ease not Nature, she will being thee to
   Dis-Ease.  Free thereof every Function of thy Body and of
   every other Part of thee according to its true Will.  This
   also is most necessary, that thou discover that true Will in
   every Case, for thou art born into Dis-Ease; where are many
   false and perverted Wills, monstrous Growths, Parasites,
   Vermin are they, adherent to thee by Vice of Heredity, or of

   Struggle.
      Consider also him that willeth to exceed in Speed or in

      Now then the one by natural, and the other by voluntary,

      In the Body every Cell is subordinated to the general
   physiological Control, and we who will that Control do not ask
   whether each individual Unit of that Structure be consciously
   happy.  But we do care that each fulfil its Function, and the
   Failure of even a few Cells, or their Revolt, may involve the
   Death of the whole Organism.  Yet even here the Complaint of a
   few, which we call Pain, is a Warning of general Danger.  Many
   Cells fulfil their Destiny by swift Death, and this being
   their Function, they in no wise resent it.  Should Haemoglobin
   resist the Attack of Oxygen, the Body would perish, and the
   Haemoglobin would not even save itself.  How, o my Son, do
   thou then consider deeply of these Things in thine Ordering of
   the World under the Law of Thelema.  For every Individual in
   the State must be perfect in his own Function, with
   Contentment, respecting his own Task as necessary and holy,

   not envious of another's.  For so only mayst thou build up a
   Free State, whose directing Will shall be singly directed to
   the Welfare of all.

      Say not, o my Son, that in this Argument I have set Limits
   to individual Freedom.  For each Man in this State which I
   purpose is fulfilling his own true Will by his eager
   Acquiescence in the Order necessary to the Welfare of all, and
   therefore of himself also.  But see thou well to it that thou
   set high the Standard of Satisfaction, and that to everyone
   there be a surplus of Leisure and of Energy, so that, his Will
   of Self-Preservation being fulfilled by the Performance of his
   Function in the State, he may devote the remainder of his
   Powers to the Satisfaction of the other Parts of his Will.

      Long, o my Son, hath been this Digression from the plain
   Path of my Word concerning Children; but it was most needful
   that thou shouldst understand the Limits of true Liberty.  For
   that is not the Will of any Man which ultimateth in his own
   Ruin and that of all his Fellows; and that is not Liberty
   whose Exercise bringeth him to Bondage.  Thou mayst therefore
   assume that it is always an essential Part of the Will of any
   Child to grow to Manhood or to Womanhood in Health, and his
   Guardians may therefore prevent him from ignorantly acting in
   Opposition thereunto, Care being always taken to remove the
   Cause of the Error, namely, Ignorance, as aforesaid.  Thou
   mayst also assume that it is Part of the Child's Will to train
   every Function of the Mind; and the Guardians may therefore
   combat the inertia which hinders its Development.  Yet here is
   much Caution necessary, and it is better to work by exciting

      Now in this Training of the Child there is one most dear
   Consideration, that I shall impress upon thee as in Conformity
   with our Holy ?Experience in the Way of Truth.  And it is
   this, that since that which can be thought is not true, every
   Statement is in some Sense false.  Even on the Sea of pure
   Reason, we may say that every Statement is in some Sense
   disputable, there fore in every Case, even the simplest, the
   Child should be taught not only the Thesis, but also its
   opposite, leaving the Decision to the Child's own Judgment and
   good Sense, fortified by Experience.  And this Practice will
   develop its Power of Thought, and its Confidence in itself,
   and its Interest in all Knowledge.  But most of all beware
   against any Attempt to bias its Mind on any point that lieth
   without the Square of ascertained and undisputed Fact.
   Remember also, even when thou art most sure, that so were they

   sure who gave instruction to the young Copernicus.  Pay
   Reverence also to the Unknown unto whom thou presumeth to

      It is important that thou shouldst understand as early as
   may be what is the true Will of the Child in the Matter of his
   Career.  Be thou well ware of all Ideals and Day-dreams; for
   the Child is himself, and not thy Toy.  Recall the comic
   Tragedy of Napoleon and the King of Rome; build not an House
   for a wild Goat, nor plant a Forest for the Domain of a Shark.
   But be thou vigilant for every Sign, conscious or unconscious
   of the Will of the Child, giving him then all Opportunity to
   pursue the Path which he thus indicates.  Learn this, that he,
   being young, will weary quickly of all false Ways, however
   pleasant they may be to him at the Outset; but of the true Way
   he will not weary.  This being in this Manner discovered, thou
   mayst prepare it for him perfectly; for no Man can keep open
   all Roads for ever.  And to him making his Choice explain how
   one may not travel far on any Road without a general Knowledge

   of Things apparently irrelevant.  And with that he will
   understand, and bend him wisely to his Work.

      I would have thee to consider, o my son, that Word of
   Publius Vergilius Maro, that was the greatest of all the
   Magicians of his time: in medio tutissimus ibis.   Which Thing
   has also been said by many wise Men in other Lands; and the
   Holy Qabalah confirmeth the same, placing Tipheret, which is
   the Man, and the Beauty and Harmony of Things, and Gold in the
   Kingdom of the Metals, and the Sun among the Planets, in the
   Midst of the Tree of Life.  For the Centre is the Point of
   Balance of all Vectors.  So then if thy wilt live wisely,
   learn that thou must establish this Relation of Balance with
   every Thing soever, not omitting one.  For there is nothing so
   alien from thy Nature that it may not be brought into
   harmonious Relation therewith; and thy Stature of Manhood
   waxeth great even as thou comest to the Perfection of this
   Art.  And there is nothing so close Kin to thee it may not be
   hurtful to thee if this Balance is not truly adjusted.  Thou

   hast need of the whole Force of the Universe to work with thy
   Will; but this Force must be disposed about the Shaft of that
   Will so that there is no Tendency to Hindrance or to
   Deflection.  And in my Love of thee I will adorn this Thesis
   with Example following.

      consider Love.  Here is a Force destructive and corrupting
   where by many Men have been lost.  Yet without Love Man were
   not Man.  Therefore thine Uncle Richard Wagner made of our
   Doctrine a musical Fable, wherein we see Amfortas, who yielded
   himself to Seduction, wounded beyond Healing; Klingsor, who
   withdraw himself from a like Danger, cast out for ever from
   the Mountain of Salvation'; and Parsifal, who yielded not,
   able to exercise the true Power of Live, and thereby to
   perform the Miracle of Redemption.  Of this also have I myself
   written in my Poema called Adonis.  It is the same with Food
   and Drink, with Exercise, with Learning itself, the Problem is
   ever to bring the Appetite into right Relation with the Will.
   Thus thou mayst fast or feast; there is no Rule than that of
   Balance.  And this Doctrine is of general Acceptation among
   the better Sort of Men; therefore on thee will I rather

   impress more carefully the other Part of my Wisdom, namely,
   the Necessity of extending constantly thy Nature to new Mates
   upon every Plane of Being, so that thou mayst become the

      I say in sooth, my son, that this Extension of thy Nature

   Nature to grow continually.  Now there is no Part of Knowledge
   which is foreign to thee; yet Knowledge itself is of no avail
   unless it be assimilated and co-ordinated into Understanding.
   Grow therefore, easily and spontaneously, developing all Parts
   equally, lest thou become a Monster.  And if one Thing tempt
   thee overmuch, correct it by Devotion to its Opposite until
   Equilibrium be re-established.  But seek not to grow by sudden
   Determination toward Things that be far from thee; only, if
   such a Thing come into thy Thought, construct a Bridge
   thereunto, and take firmly the first Step upon the Bridge.  I
   shall explain this.  Dost thou speculate upon the Motives of
   the Stars, and on their Elements, their Size and Weight?  Then
   thou must first gain Knowledge of Doctrine mathematical, of

   Laws physical and chemical.  So then first, that thou mayst
   understand clearly the Nature of thine whole Work, map out thy

   and persecute the Torchbearers.  Do thou therefore analyse
   most fully all those Ideas which Men avoid; for the Truth
   shall dissolve Fear.  Rightly indeed Men say that the Unknown
   is terrible; but wrongly do they fear lest it become the

   beware, save where thou hast already full knowledge, that thou
   mayest learn Use and Control, not falling into Abuse and

   Causes and Effects.  For thy Mind hath been built up of these
   Elements, so that in these Books thou mayst bring into the

   it were the Mortar in the House of thy Mind, without which is
   no Cohesion or Individuality possible, so that the Lack

   Yes, o my Son, in these Writings thou mayst study to come to

   the true Comprehension of thine own Nature, and that of the
   whole Universe, in the Dimension of Time, even as the

   Variety of the Universe, its Harmony and its Beauty, with the
   Knowledge of that which compelleth it.  Yet this is not equal
   to the former two in Power to reveal thee to thy Self; and its
   first Use is to instruct thee in the true Method of
   Advancement in Knowledge, which is fundamentally, the
   Observation of the Like and the Unlike.  Also, it shall arouse
   in thee the Ekstacy of Wonder; and it shall bring thee to a
   proper Understanding of Art Magick.  For our Magick is but one
   of the powers that lie within us undeveloped and unanalysed;
   and it is by the Method of Science that it must be made clear,

      Give Ear attentively, o my Son, while I expound unto thee
   the true Doctrine of Magick.  Every force acteth, in due
   Proportion, on all Things with which it is connected.  Thus a
   burning Forest causes chemical Change by Combustion, and
   giveth Heat and Motion to the Air about it by the Operation of
   physical Laws, and exciteth thought and Emotion in the Man
   whom it reacheth through his Organs of Perception.  Consider
   (even though it were by Legent) the Fall of the apple of Isaac
   Newton, its Effect upon the Spiritual Destinies of Man!
   Consider also that no Force cometh ever to the end of its
   work!  The Air that is moved by my Breath is a Disturbance or
   Change of Equilibrium that cannot be fully compensated and
   brought to naught, though the Aeons be endless.  Who then
   shall deny the Possibility of Magick?  Well said Frazer, the
   most learned Doctor of the College of the Holy Trinity in the

   University of Cambridge, that Science was but the Name of any
   Magick which failed not of its intended Effect.

      Lo!  I put forth my Will, and my Pen moveth upon the Paper,

   the Inertia of the Pen.  I cannot break down the Wall opposite
   me by Cause that I cannot come into mechanical Relation with
   it; or the Wall at my Side, by Cause that I am not strong
   enough to overcome its Inertia.  To win that Battle I must
   call Time and Pick-axe to mine aid.  But how could I retard
   the Motion of the Earth in Space?  I am myself Party of its
   Momentum.  Yet every Stroke of my Pen affecteth that Motion by
   changing the Equilibrium thereof.  The Problem of every Act of
   Magick is then this: to exert a Will sufficiently powerful to
   cause the required Effect, through a Menstruum or Medium of
   Communication.  By the common Understanding of the Word
   Magick, we however exclude such Media as are generally known

   and understood.  Now then, o my Son, will I declare unto thee

      All Things are interwoven.  The most spiritual Thought in
   thy Soul (I speak as a Fool) is also a most material Change in
   Blood or Brain.  Anger maketh the Blood acid; Hate poisoneth
   Mother's milk; even as I showed formerly in reverse, how
   Disturbance of physical Function altereth the States of
   Consciousness.  Now no Man doubteth the Power of the Will of
   Man, whether it be his love that begetteth Children or causes
   wars wherein many Men be slain, whether it be his Eloquence
   that moveth a Mob or his Vanity that destroyeth a People.
   Only in all such Cases we understand how Nature worketh,
   though known Laws physical or psychical.  That is, there is a
   State of unstable Equilibrium, so that one Machine setteth
   another in Motion as soon as the first Disturbance ariseth.
   Therefore, it is not proper to regard all Consequence of a
   Will as its Effect.  Without the Revolution there could have
   been no great Effect of the Will of Napoleon; and moreover his

   Will was broken in the End, to the present Misfortune (as it
   seems to many beside myself) of Mankind.  This Magick
   therefore, dependeth greatly on the Art to set many other
   Wills in sympathetic Motion; and the greatest Magus may not be
   the most successful in a mean conception of a Limit of Time.
   He may need to strike many Blows before he breaketh down his

   if every Act has an Effect on every Plane, how canst thou do
   this unless thou be connected with all Planes?  For this
   Reason must thou know thoroughly not only thy Body and thy
   Mind, but thy Body of Light and all its subtler Principles
   soever.  But I will have thee consider most especially what
   powers thou hast within thee which are certainly capable of
   great Effects, yet which are constantly wasted.  Think then
   whether, if these Powers, frustrate of their End upon one
   Plane, might not be turned to high Purpose and assured Success

   plant Corn, which in due Season being eaten is again
   transmuted into Will.  Thus thou mayst in many Ways impress
   any particular Will upon the proper Substance, so that by due
   Use thou comest at last to its Accomplishment.  So general is
   this Formula, in Truth, that all conscious Actions may be

   shalt best learn by thine own Experience, and thine

      But concerning the Medium by whose sensitive Nature our
   Magick Force is transmitted to the Object of our Working,
   doubt not.  For already in other Galaxies of Physics have we
   been compelled to postulate an Aethyr wholly hypothetical in
   order to explain the Phenomena of Light, Electricity, and the
   like; nor doeth any Man demand Demonstration of the Existence
   of that Aethyr other than its Conformity with general Law.
   Thou therefore, Creator and Transmitter of thine own Energy,
   needest not to ask whether by this or by some other Means thou
   performest thy Work.  Yet I know not why this Aethyr of the
   Mathematicians and the Physicians should not be one with the
   Astral Light, or Plastic Medium or Aub, Aud, Aur (these three
   being a Trinity) of which our own Sages have spoken.  And this
   Meditation may bring forth much Knowledge physical, which is
   good, for that which is above is like that which is beneath,

   and the Study of any Law leadeth to the Understanding of all
   Law.  So mayst thou learn in the End that there is no Law
   beyond Do what thou wilt.

      And how then (mayest thou) shall I reconcile this Art
   Magick with that Way of the Tao which achieveth all Things by
   doing nothing?  But this have I already declared to thee in
   Part, showing that thou canst do no Magick save it be thy
   Nature to do Magick and so the true Nothing for thee.  For to
   do nothing signifieth to interfere with nothing so that for a
   Magician to do no Magick is to commit Violence on himself.
   Yet learn also that all Action is in some sense Magick, being
   an essential Part of that Great Magical Work which we call
   Nature.  Then thou hast no free Will?  Verily, thou hast said.
   Yet nevertheless it is thy necessary Destiny to act with that
   free Will.  Thou canst do nothing save in accordance with that
   true Nature of thine and of all Things, and every Phenomenon
   is the Resultant of the Totality of Forces; Amen.  Then thou
   needest take no Thought and make no Effort?  Thou sast sooth;

   yet, art thou not compelled to Thought and Effort in the Way
   of Nature?  Yea, I, thy Father, work for thee solicitously,

   and every Part of the Play is Play.  All pain is but sharp

      Consider for an Example the Game and Play of the Chess,
   which is a Pastime of Man, and worthy to exercise him in
   Thought, yet by no means necessary to his Life, so that he
   sweepeth away Board and Pieces at the least Summons of that
   which is truly dear to him.  Thus unto him this Game is as it
   were an Illusion.  But insofar as he entereth into the Game he
   abideth by the Rules thereof, though they be artificial and in
   no wise proper to his Nature; for in this Restriction is all
   his Pleasure.  Therefore, though he hath All-Oower to move the

   thou perceivest it, the Law of its Being (or By-coming) is a
   Law of Truth.  Learn then that all Relations are true upon
   their own Plane, and that it would be a Violation of Nature to
   adjust them skewwise.  Thus, albeit thou hast found thy Self,
   and knowest Thy Self immortal and immutable beyond Time and
   Space, free of Causality, so thoroughly that even thy Mind
   partaketh constantly thereof, thou hast in no wise altered the
   Relations of thy Body with its Syndromics in the World whereof

   proceedeth from their Original One Nature, there is Action and
   Reaction of the one upon the other, as I have already set

   sayeth is recognized as the Expression of their own Thought by
   Men, they translate this into Act, so that, in the Parlance of
   the Folk vulgar and ignorant, "that which he foretold is come
   to pass".  Now then the Poet is Interpreter of the Hieroglyphs
   of the Hidden Will of Man in many a matter, some light, some
   deep, as it may be given unto him to do.  Moreover, it is not
   altogether in the Word of any Poem, but in the quintessential
   Flavour of the Poet, that thou mayst seek this Prophecy.  And
   this is an Art most necessary toe every Statesman.  Who but

   He then is called the Logos, or Logos Aiones, that is to say,

   Soul, as Men ill translate it, meaning a Substance incapable
   of Change.  Thus, He, like Lao-Tze, based all upon a Movement,
   instead of a fixed Point.  And His Way of Truth was Analysis,
   made possible by great Intention of the Mind toward itself,
   and that well fortified by certain tempered Rigour of Life.
   And He most thoroughly explored and Mapped out the Fastnesses
   of the Mind, and gave the Keys of its Fortresses into the Hand

   or, as they then phrased it, with God.  And He discovered unto

   followeth, is darkened and confused by His Nearness to our own
   Time, so that I say not save with Diffidence that His Word
   ALLH may mean this or that.  But I am bold concerning His
   Doctrine of the Unity of God, for God is Man, and he said
   therefore: Man is One.  And His Will was to unite all Men in
   One reasonable Faith: to make possible international Co-
   operation in Science.  Yet, because He arose in the Time of
   the greatest possible Corruption and Darkness, when every
   Civilisation and Every Religion had fallen into Ruin, by the
   malice of the great Sorcerer of Nazareth, as some say, He is

   still hidden in the Dust of the Simoom, and we may not

      O my son!  me seemeth in certain Hours that I am myself
   fallen on a Time even more fearful and fatal than did
   Mahommed, peace be upon Him!  But I read clearly the Word of
   the Aeon, that is A B R A H A D A B R A, wherein is the whole
   Mystery of the great Work, as thou knowest.  And I have "The""
   ""Book of the Law", that was given unto me by Him thou wottest
   of; and it is the Interpretation of the Secret Will of Man on
   every Plane of his By-coming; and the Word of the Law is T H E

   L E M A.  'Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."
   Now because "Love is the law, love under will." do I write
   this Epistle for thee, that thou mayst fulfil this inmost Will
   of Mankind, making them capable of Light, Live, Love and
   Liberty by the Acceptance of this Law.  And the Hindrance
   thereunto is but as the Shell of its Egg to an Eaglet, ad
   Thing foreign to itself, a Protection till the Hour strike,
   and then --- no more!

      Here I reach forth mine Hands against thee in the Sign of
   the Enterer, o son of my Bowels, for with all my Magical Might
   I will that thou fight manfully and labour with Diligence
   (with Sword and Trowel; say I) in this Work.  For this is the
   first and last of all, that thou bid every Man do What he
   will, in accord with his own true Nature.  Therefore also
   blast thou that Lie that Man is of a fallen and evil Nature.
   For the Word of Sin is Restriction, the Doubt of his own
   Godhead, the Suppression of, which is the Blasphemy against,
   his own Holy Spirit.  Saith not "The Book of the Law" that
   "...It is a lie, this folly against self. ..."?  Therefore to
   every Man, in every Circumstance, say thou: Do what thou wilt;
   and teach him, if he yet waver, how to discover his true
   Nature, earnestly and with Ardour, even as I have striven to
   teach thee --- yea, and more also!

   Nature Herself?  "...thou hast no right but to do thy will.
   Do that, and no other shall say nay."  For if that Will be
   true, its Fulfilment is of a Surety as Daylight following
   Sunrise.  It is as certain as the Operation of any other Law
   of Nature; it is Destiny.  Then, if that Will be obscured, if
   thou turn from it to Wills diseased or perverse, how canst
   thou hope?  Fool!  Even thy Turns and Twists are in the Path

      Listen attentively, my Son, while I with heavy Heart make
   Confession to thee of mine own Frailty.  Thou knowest that I
   made Renunciation of my Wage, taking this Body immediately
   after my Death, the Death of Eliphas Levi Zahed, as Men say,
   that I might attain to this great Work.  It is now twenty
   Years, as Men count years, that I came to my first
   Understanding of my true Nature, and aspired to that Work.
   Now then at first I made no Error.  I abandoned my chosen
   Career; I poured out my whole Fortune without one Thought; I
   gave my Life utterly to the Work, without keeping back the
   least imaginable Thing.  So then I made swift Strides along
   the Path.  But in the Dhyanas that were granted unto me in
   kKandy, in the Island of Lanka, I used up my whole Charge of
   Magical Energy; and for two Years I fell away from the Work.

      Now it may be well that such Periods of Recuperation are
   necessary to such souls as mine; and so no Ill.  But I fell
   from my Will, and sought other Ends in Life; and so the Hand
   came upon me, and tore away that which I desired, as thou
   knowest; also it is written in the Temple of Solomon the King.
   Yet consider also these two Years as a necessary Preparation
   for that greatest of all Events which befell me in El-Kahira,
   in the Land of Khem, the Choice of me as the Word of the Aeon.
   Now then for a while I worked with my Will, though not wholly;
   and again the Hand reached forth and smote me.  This, albeit
   my Slackness was but as a Boy playing Truant, not a revolt
   against my Self.  Wherefore, despite all, I made much Progress
   in short Time.

      Now then, well schooled, I strove no more against my
   Nature, and worked with all my Will.  Thou knowest well how
   greatly I was rewarded.  Yet in this last Initiation to the
   Grade of Magus, wherein three-and-seventy Days, as Men count
   Days, is but One Day, the Ordeal grew so fierce and
   intolerable that I gave back a Step.  I did not utterly
   renounce the Work, but I swore not to continue unless mine
   Agony were abated.  But after fifteen Days, I came to myself
   in a certain Ordeal, wherein I knew myself finally, that I
   could do no other than take up that fearful Burden that had
   broken my Spirit.  And for these fifteen Days have I not
   suffered infinite Things?  Was not the Tree of my Work frozen,
   one Branch withered, and on blasted?  Look no more, o my son,

      And after?  This Dawn (for I have toiled through the Night
   in my great Love and Care of thee) how is it with me?  it is
   well.  For I have found myself; I have found my Will; the
   Obstacles that daunted me are seen to be by the Shadows of
   Shadows.  Grace be unto Lady B A B A L O N.
      Thus it is written in "The Book of the Law":  "Remember all
   ye that existence is pure joy; that all the sorrows are but as
   shadows; they pass & are done; but there is that which
   remains."
      Learn then that it is in the contemplation of Division that
   Sorrow is, for Division is the Formula of Choronzon.  It is
   therefore discreet for thee to unite each element of Sorrow
   with its Opposite; in whose Triumph of Hymen is Ekstacy, until
   by Apprehension of the new great Opposite the Idea is again
   seen as Sorrow.  This then is the Issue from Sorrow; and thou

   mayst understand that I now also am confident in the Necessity
   of this my Fall to prepare the formula of my Exaltation.
   Therefore, my Son, thus Hail Me: Blessing and worship to the

      O my Son, learn this concerning Magick, that the Yang
   moveth, and thus giveth itself up Eternally; but the Yin
   moveth not, seeking ever to enclose or restrict, reproducing
   in its own likeness what Impressions soever it  made thereon,
   yet without Surrender.  Now the Tao absorbeth all without
   Reproduction; so then let the Yang turn thereto, and not unto
   the Yin.  And that thou mayst understand this, I say: It is a
   Mystery of O.T.O.  For the Sun ariseth not and entereth to
   strike upon the High Altar of the Minster by the Great Western
   Gates, but by the Rose Oriel doth he make Way and Progress in
   His Pageant.  O my Son, the Doors of Silver are wide open, and
   they tempt thee with their Beauty: but by the narrow Portal of
   Pure Gold shalt thou come nobly to thy Sanctuary.  Behold!
   Thou knowest not how perfect is this Magick; it is the
   dearest-bought and holiest of our Arcana.  What then is like

      Here now is another Formula of Power, good to invoke any
   Being to manifest in thyself.  First, invoke him by the Power
   of all thy Spells and conjurations, with Mind concentrated and
   Will vehement, toward him, as I have written in many Books.
   But because thou are NEMO, thou mayst safely invoke him, no
   matter of what Nature, within thy Circle.  Now then do thou
   confer on him as a Guerdon of his Obedience the Dignity of a
   Soul seeking Incarnation, and so precede to consecrate thine
   Act by performing the Mass of the Holy Ghost.  Then shall that
   Spirit make himself Body from those Elements, and thou
   partaking thereof makest thine own Body his Machinery of
   Manifestation, and thus mayst thou work with any Spirit
   soever; yet this shall serve thee most in common Life.  Also

   the Qualities are well defined in the Cards of the Tarot, so
   that thou hast a clear-cut Means of developing thy Powers
   according to the Needs of the Time.  But learn also this, to
   work constantly under the Guidance of thine Holy Guardian
   Angel, so that thy Workings be alway in Harmony and Accord

      Now then to thee who art long since Master of High Magick,
   it will be easy to shew how the Mass of the Holy Ghost, sung
   even in Ignorance, may work many a Wonder by Virtue of the
   Force generated being compelled to manifest on other than its
   own Plane.  Here then is a Theory of the Mystery of the Aeon,
   that I, being the Logos appointed thereunto, did create an
   Image of my little Universe in the Mind of the Woman of
   Scarlet; that is, I manifested my whole Magical Self in her
   Mind.  Thus then in Her, as in a Mirror, have I been able to
   interpret myself to myself.  Thou also in thine own Way hast
   the Power to create such an Image; but be thou sure and alert,
   testing constantly the Persons in that Image by the Holy
   Qabalah and by the true Signs of Brotherhood.  For each Person
   therein shall be a Part of thyself, made individual and
   perfect, able to instruct thee in thy Path.  Yet often there

   shall be others, that are to aid thee in thy Working, or to
   oppose it.  And in this Matter thou shalt read especially the
   Record of thy Father His Workings with Soror Ahita (blessed be
   Her Name unto the Ages) and certain others to Boot.

      Now at last, o my son, may I being thee to understand the
   Truth of this Formula that is hidden in the Mass of the Holy
   Ghost.  For Horus that is Lord of the Aeon is the Child
   crowned and conquering.  The formula of Osiris was, as thou
   knowest, a Word of Death, that is, the Force lay long in
   Darkness, and by Putrifaction came to Resurrection.  But we
   take living Things, and pour in Life and Nature of our own
   Will, so that instantly and without Corruption the Child (as
   it were the Word of that Will) is generated; and again
   immediately taketh up his Habitation among us to manifest in
   Force and Fire.  This Mass of the Holy Ghost is then the true
   Formula of the Magick of the Aeon of Horus, blessed by He in
   His Name Ra-Hoor-Khuit!  And thou shalt bless also the Name of
   our Father Merlin, Frater Superior of the O.T.O., for that by
   seven Years of Apprenticeship in His School did I discover

   this most excellent Way of Magick.  Be thou diligent, o my
   son, for in this wondrous Art is no more Toil, Sorrow, and
   Disappointment, as it was in the dead Aeon of the Slain Gods.

      Here then is the Schedule for all the Operations of Magick.
   First, thou shalt discover thy true Will, as I have already
   taught thee, and that Bud thereof which is the Purpose of this
   Operation.
      Next, formulate this Bud-Will as a Person, seeking or
   constructing it, and naming it according to thine Holy
   Qabalah, and its infallible Rule of Truth.  Third, purify and
   consecrate this Person, concentrating upon him and against all
   else.  This Preparation shall continue in all thy daily Life.
   Mark well, make ready a new Child immediately after every
   Birth.  Fourth, make an especial and direct Invocation at thy
   Mass, before the Introit, formulating a visible Image of this
   Child, and offering the Right of Incarnation.  Fifth, perform
   the Mass, not omitting the Epiklesis, and let there be a
   Golden Wedding Ring at the Marriage of thy Lion with thine

   Eagle.  Sixth, at the Consumption of the Eucharist accept this
   Child, losing thy Consciousness in him, until he be well
   assimilated with thee.  Now then do this continuously, for by
   Repetition cometh forth both Strength and Skill, and the
   Effect is cumulative, if thou allow no Time to dissipate
   itself.

      Behold moreover, my Son, the Oeconomy of this Way, how it
   is according to the Tao, fulfilling itself wholly within thine
   own Sphere.  And it is utterly in Tune with thine own Will on
   every Plane, so that every Part of thy Nature rejoiceth with
   every other Part, communicating Praise.  Now then learn also
   how this Formula is that of the Word ABRAHADABRA.  First, HAD
   is the Triangle erect upon twin Squares.  Of Hadit need I not
   to write, for He hath hidden Himself in "The Book of the Law".
   This Substance is the Father, the Instrument is the Son, and
   the Metaphysical Ekstacy is the Holy Ghost, whose Name is
   HRILIU.  These are then the Sun, Mercury, and Venus, whose
   sacred letters are R ({HB:Resh }), B ({HB:Bet }), and D ({HB:Dalet }).  But the
   last of the Diverse Letters is H ({HB:Heh }), which in the Tarot
   is the Star whose Eidolon is D ({HB:Dalet }); and herein is that
   Arcanum concerning the Tao of which I have already written.

   Of this will I not write more plainly.  But mark this, that
   our Trinity is our Path inwards in the Solar System, and that
   H being of our Lady Nuith starry, is an Anchor to this Magick
   which else were apt to deny our wholeness of Relation to the
   Outer as to the Inner.  My son, ponder these Words, and profit
   by them; for I have wrought cunningly to conceal or to reveal,
   according to thine Intelligence, o my Son!

      Now of those Operations of Magick by which thou seekest to
   display unto some other Person the Righteousness of thy Will I
   make haste to instruct thee.  First, if thou have a reasonable
   Link with him by Word or Letter, it is most natural simply to
   create in thyself, as I have taught, a Child or Bud-Will, and
   let that radiate from thee through the Channels aforesaid.
   But if thou have no Link, the Case is otherwise and is not
   easy.  Here thou mayst make Communication through others, as
   it were by Relays; or thou mayst act directly upon his Aura by
   Magical Means, such as the Projection of the Scin-Laeca.  But
   unless he be sensitive and well-attuned, thou mayst fare but
   ill.  Yet even in this Case thou mayst attain much Skill by
   Practice with Intelligence.  In the End it is better
   altogether to work wholly within thine own Universe, slowly
   and with firm Steps advancing from the Centre, and dealing,

   one by one, with those unharmonized Parts of the Not-Self
   which lie close to thee.  This therefore closeth the Circle of
   my Speech, for now I am returned to that which I spake
   aforetime concerning the general Method of love, and thy
   Development by that Way.

      But now give Ear most eagerly, thou Son of my Loins, for I
   will now discourse unto thee of thine Own Attainment, without
   which all is but Idleness.  Know first that conscious Thought
   is but phenomenal, the Noise of thy Machine.  Now Chemistry,
   or Al-Chem-y meaneth the Egyptian Science, and the true Magick
   of Egypt hath this for its Foundation.  We have in our House
   many Substances which act directly upon the Blood, and many
   Practices of Virtue similar, to simulate, compose, purify,
   analyse, direct, or concentrate the Thought.  Confer "CCXX". 11,
   22.  But this Action is subtle and of man Modes, and dependeth
   heavily on the Conditions of the Experiment, whereof the first
   is thine own Will therein.  Therefore I say unto thee that
   this is thy Work immediate and necessary, to discover openly
   thy Will unto thyself, and to fortify and enkindle it by all
   One-Pointedness of Thought and Action, so that thou mayst

   direct it inwards unto its Core, that is Thyself in thy Name
   HADIT.  For thereby is thy Will made white with Heat, so that
   no Dross may cling to it.  But this Work is the Great Work,
   and standeth alone.

      This Great Work is the Attainment of the Knowledge and

   thyself most heartily and well for that Battle of Love by all
   means of Magick.  Make thyself puissant, wise, radiant in
   every System, and balance thyself well in thine Universe.
   Then with a pure Will tempered in the thousand Furnaces of thy
   Trials, burn up thyself within thy Self.  In the Preparation
   thou shalt have learnt how thou mayst still all Thoughts, and
   reach Ekstacy of Trance in many Modes.  But in these Marriages
   thy conscious Self is Bridegroom, and the not-Self Bride,
   while in this Great Work thou givest up that conscious Self as
   Bride to thy true Self.  This Operation is then radically
   alien from all others.  And it is hard, because it is a total
   Reversal of the Current of the Will, and a Transmutation of

   its Formula and Nature.  Here, o my son, is the One Secret of
   Success in this Great Work:  Invoke often.

   the Formula of the Serpent with the Head of the Lion, and all
   this Magick is wrought by the Radiance and Creative Force
   thereof.  And this Force leapeth continually from Plane to
   Plane, and breaketh forth from his Bonds, so that Constraint
   is Labour.  Now then learn that the Yin hath also a Formula of
   Force.  And the Nature of the Yin is to be still, and to
   encircle of limit, and it is as a Mirror, reflecting diverse
   Images without Change in its own Kind.  So then it seeketh
   never to overlap the Barriers of its Plane; for this Reason it
   is well to use it in Operations of a very definite and
   restricted Type.  But although it be inert, yet is it most
   subject to Change; for its Number is four Score and one, which

   is the Moon; and these are A L O ,, the Gods elemental before
   H descending in their midst made them Creative.  So then thou

   Therefore the Prime Use of this Art is to build up thine own

   Eagle, then mayst thou work many an admirable Effect upon
   thine Environment.  Thou knowest how great is the Fame of
   Witch-Women (old and without Man) to cause Events, although
   they create nothing.  It is this Straitness of the Channel
   which giveth Force to the Stream.  Beware, o my Son, lest thou
   cling overmuch to this Mode of Magick; for it is lesser than
   that Other, and if thou neglect That Other, then is thy Danger
   fearful and imminent, for it is the Edge of the Abyss of

   Menstruum for his Serpents.  Now to Fire belong Cocaine, which
   fortifieth the Will, loosing him from bodily Fatigue,
   Morphine, which purifieth the Mind, making the Thought safe,
   and slow, and single, Heroin which partaketh as it seemeth, of
   the Nature of these twain aforesaid albeit in Degree less
   notable than either of them, and Alcohol, which is Food, that
   is, Fuel, for the whole Man.  To Water, attribute Hashish and
   Mescal, for they make Images, and they open the hidden Springs
   of Pleasure and of Beauty.  Morphine, for its Ease, hath also
   part in Water.  Air ruleth Ethyl Oxide, for it is as a Sword,
   dividing asunder ever Part of thee, making easy the Way of

   Analysis, so that thou comest to learn thyself of what
   Elements thou art compact.  Lastly, of the Nature of Earth are
   the direct Hypnotics, which operate by Repose, and restore thy
   Strength by laying thee as a Child in the Arms of the Great

   Word following:  The Right Use of these Agents is to gain a
   Knowledge preliminary of thine own Powers, and of High States,
   so that thou goest not altogether blindly and without Aim in
   thy Quest, ignorant of the Ways of thine own inner Being.
   Also, thou must work always for a definite End, never for
   Pleasure or for Relaxation, except thy wilt, as a good Knight

   is sworn to do.  And thou being Hero and Magician art in Peril
   of abusing the fiery Agents only, not those of Earth, Air or

      But in the Sacrament of the Gnosis, which is of the Spirit,
   is there naught hurtful, for its Elements are not only Food,

   Liberty, and at its Manifestation thy Lion is consecrated by
   pure Light of Ekstacy.  Also, as this is the strongest so also
   it is the most sensitive of all Things soever, and both proper

   wilt shall be the whole of the Law.  See thou constantly to it
   that this be not broken; especially in the Section thereof (if
   I dare say so) which readeth Mind thine own Business.  This is
   of Application equally to all, and the most dangerous Man (or
   Woman, as has occurred, or I err) is the Busy-body.  Oh how
   ashamed are we, and moved to Indignation, seeing the Sins and
   Follies of our Neighbours!  Of all the Occasions of this
   Grievance the most common is the Desire of Sex unsatisfied;
   and thou knowest already, even in thy young Experience, how in
   that Delirium the Weal of the Whole Universe appeareth of no
   Account.  Do thou wean thy Babes from that Simplicity, and
   instil the Sense of true Proportion.  For verily this is a Way

   of Madness, Love, unless it be under Will.  And the Cure of
   this Madness is not so good as its Prevention, so that thou
   shouldst be beforehand with these Children, shewing them the
   right Importance of Love, how it should be a sacred Rite,
   exalted above Personality, and a Fire to enlighten and serve
   Man, not to devour him.

      And thus, if any Babe of thine be ill at ease, look closely
   first whether this Love be not the Root of his Distemper.
   Watch also Idleness, for whoso presseth eagerly forward in
   Will heedeth little the Affairs of this Fellows.  O my Son, if
   every Man doth his own Will, there is no more to Say!  But the
   Busy-body nor mindeth his own Business, nor leaveth others to
   mind theirs.  Be thou instant therefore with such an one, to
   cure him by enlightening his Will, and speeding him therein.
   Remember also that if one speak ill of another, the Fault is
   first of all in himself, for we know naught but that which is
   within us.  Did not the great Witch-Finder end by confessing
   that he also was a Sorcerer?  We become that which obsesseth
   us, either through extreme Hate or Extreme Love.  Knowest thou
   not how the one is a Symbol of the other?  For this Reason,
   since Love is the Formula of Life, we are under Bond to

   assimilate (in the End) that which we fear or hate.  So then
   we shall be wise to mould all Things within ourselves in
   Quietness and Modulation.  But above all must we use all to
   our own End, adapting with Adroitness even our Weakness to the
   Work.

      Therefore, watch heedfully the Fault of another, that thou
   mayst correct it in thyself.  For if it were not in thee, thou
   couldst not perceive it or understand it.  Lo, in thine
   Ekstacy of Love, thou callest upon the Universe to bear
   Witness that to this End alone was it created; it is
   unthinkable that thou shouldst love another, and
   incomprehensible that any Man should grieve.  Yet ere the Moon
   change her Quarter, thou art free of thy Lunes, and lovest
   another, and it may be grievest in thyself while he that
   amazed thee hath joined the Company of the Rejoicing.  Watch
   then, and heed thyself; and pay no Heed to thy Fellows,
   insofar as they impede thee not.  And let this be the Rule.
   For every Will is pure and every Orbit free; but Error
   bringeth Confusion.  See therefore that none leave his Path,
   lest he foul that of his Brother; and remember also that with

   Speed cometh Ease of Control.  Let each Man therefore urge
   briskly his Chariot in a right Line toward the Centre; for two
   Radii cannot cross.  And beware most of this Love, because it
   lieth so close to Will that Dis-ease thereof easily imparteth
   his Error to the Whole Way of the Magician.

   the past Aeon was of the Dying god, and was based upon

   alike in the Day and in the Year; and so also was the Mystery
   of Man.  Now already are we well assured by Science how the
   Death of the Sun is in Truth but the Shifting of a Shadow; and
   in this Aeon (o my son, I lift up my Voice and I make

   is the Law, because every Change is an Act of Love under will.
   So then He that is Adept Exempt, whether in our Holy Order or
   another, may not remain in the Pillar of Mercy, because it is
   not balanced, but is unstable.  Therefore is the Choice given
   unto him, whether he will destroy his Temple, and give up his
   Life, extending it to Universal Life, or whether he will make
   a Fortress about that Temple, and abide therein, in the false
   Sphere of Daath, which is in the Abyss.  And to the Adepts of
   our Holy Order this Choice is terrible; by Cause that they
   must abandon even Him whose Knowledge and Conversation they
   have attained.  Yet, o my Son, they have much Help of our
   Order in this Aeon, because the general Formula is Love, so
   that their habit itself urges them to the Bed of our Lady

   restrict and deny Love, fear Death.  Percutiantur.

   static Standards either in Thought or in Action Resist not
   even the Change that is the Rottenness of Choronzon, but
   rather speed it, so that the elements may combine by Love
   under Will.  Since the Black Brothers and their Cults set
   themselves against Change, do thou break them asunder.  Yea,
   though of bad come worse, continue in that Way; for it is as
   if thou didst open an Abscess, the first Effect being noisome
   exceedingly, but the last Cleanness.  Heed not then, whoso

      I have already written unto thee, my Son, of the Paradox of
   Liberty, how the Freedom of thy Will dependeth upon the
   Bending of all thy forces to that one End.  But now also learn
   how great is the Oeconomy of our Magick, and this will I
   declare unto thee in a Figure of the Holy Qabalah, to wit, the
   Formula of the Tetragrammaton.  Firstly, the Operation of Yod
   and He is not Vau only, but with Vau appeareth also a new He,
   as a By-OProduct, and She is mysterious, being at once the
   Flower of the three others, and their Poison.  Now by the
   Operation of Vau upon that He is no new Creation, but the
   Daughter is set upon the Throne of Her Mother, and by this is
   rekindled the Fire of Yod, which, consuming that Virgin, doth
   not add a Fifth Person, but balanceth and perfecteth all.  For

   this Shin, that is the Holy Spirit, pervadeth these, and is
   immanent.  Thus in three Operations is the Pentagram
   formulated.  But in the Figure of that Star these Operations
   are not indicated, for the five Lines of Force connect not
   according to any of them; but five new Operations are made
   possible; and these are the Works proper to the perfected man.
   First, the Work which lieth level, the Vau with the He, is of
   the Yang and the Yin, and maketh One the Human with the
   Divine, as in the Attainment of the Master of the Temple.  Yet
   this Work hath his Perversion, which is of Death.  Thus then
   for thee four Works, they pertain all to the Natural Formula
   ofthe Cross and Rose.

      O my Son, behold now the Virtue and Mystery of the Silver
   Star!  For of these four Works not one leadeth to the Crown,
   because Tetragrammaton hath his Root only in Chokmah.  So
   therefore the Formula of the Rosy Cross availeth no more in
   the Highest.  Now then in the Pentagram are two Lines that
   invoke Spirit, though they lead not thereunto, and they are
   the Works of He with He, and of Yod with Vau.  Of thee twain
   the former is a Work Magical of the Nature of Music, and it
   draweth down the Fire of the HIGHER by Seduction or
   Bewitchment.  And the latter is a Work opposite thereunto,
   whose Effect forumlateth itself by direct Creation in the
   Sphere of its Purpose and Intent.  But there remain yet two of
   the Eight Works, namely, the straight Aspiration of the Chiah

   or Creator in thee to the Crown, and the Surrender of the
   Nephesh or Animal soul to the Possession thereof; and these be
   the twin principal Formulae of the Final Attainment, being
   Archetypes of the Paths of Magick (the one) and Mysticism (the
   other) unto the End.  From each of these Eight Works is
   derived a separate Mode of practical Use, each after his Kind;
   and it should be well for thine Instruction if thou study upon
   these my Words, and found upon them a System.  O my son,
   forget not therein the Arcanum of their Balance and
   Proportion; fort herein lieth the Mystery of their Holiness.

      Thus far then concerning the Pentagram, how it is of the
   Cross, and its Virtue of the Highest; but the Hexagram is for
   the most Part a Detail of the Formula of the Rose and Cross.
   Already have I shewed unto thee how the Most Holy Trinity is
   the Yang; but the Spirit, and the Water (or Fluid) and the
   Blood, that bear Witness in the Inferior, are of the Yin.
   Thus the Operation of the Hexagram lieth wholly within the
   Order of our Plane, uniting indeed any soul with its Image,
   but not transcendentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vau
   that springeth from the Union of the Yod and the He.  Thus is
   it but a Glyph of that first Formula, not of the others.  But
   of all these Things shalt thou thyself make Study with ardent
   Affection; for therein lie many Mysteries of practical Wisdom
   in our Magick Art.  And this is the Wonder and Beauty of this
   Work, that for every Man is his own Palace.  Yea, this is

   Life, that the Secrets of our Order are not fixed and dead, as
   are the Formulae of the Outer.  Know that in the many thousand
   Times that I have performed the Ritual of the Pentagram or the
   Invocation of the Heart girt with a Serpent, or the Mass of
   the Phoenix, or of the Holy Ghost, there has not been one Time
   wherein I did not win new Light, or Knowledge or Power or

      My Son, I am enflamed with Love.  I burn up eagerly in the
   Passion that thus mightily consumeth me.  Yet in myself I know
   not at all That which constraineth me, and enkindleth my Soul
   in Ekstacy.  There is Silence in my Soul, and the Fear round
   about me, as I were Syrinx in the Night of the Forest.  This
   is a great Mystery that I endure, a Mystery too great for the
   mortal Part of me.  For but now, when I cried out upon the
   Name Olun, which is the secret Name of my Lady that hath come
   to me --- most strangely! --- then I was rapt away altogether
   subtly yet fiercely into a Trance that hath transformed me
   with Attainment, yet without Trace in Mind.  O my son!  there
   is the Transfiguration of Glory, and there is the Jewel in the
   Lotus-flower; yea, also is many other whereof I am Partaker.

   But this last Passion, that my Lady Olun hath brought unto me
   upon this last Day of the Winter of the thirteenth Year of the
   Aeon, even as I wrote these Words unto thee, is a Mystery of
   Mysteries beyond all these.  Oh my son, thou knowest well the

      Four Seasons, or it may be night five, ago, I thy Father
   was in the City called New-Orleans, and being in Travail of
   Spirit I did invoke the God that giveth Wisdom, bearing the
   Word of the All-Father by his Caduceus.  Then, suddenly, as I
   began (as it were a Gust of Fire whirled forth against that
   Idea) cam the Wit of mine utter Identity, so that I ceased
   crying Mercurius Sum.  Also instantly I knew in myself that
   there was a Mystery hidden, and translating into the Greek
   Tongue, exclaimed '{Epsilon }{Pi }{Mu }{Eta }{Sigma } '{Epsilon }{Iota }{Mu }{Iota },
   whose Numeration did I make in my Mind forthwith, and it is
   Four Hundred and Eighteen, like unto the Word of the Aeon.  So
   by this I knew that my Work was well wrought in Truth.  Thus
   then also was it with this my Lady; for after many Questions I
   obtained from the wizard Amalantrah that Name Olun, that is
   One Hundred and Fifty and Six even as that of our Lady

   BABALON; and then, being inspired, I wrote down Her Earth-name
   in Greek, {Mu }{Alpha }{Rho }{Iota }{Epsilon }, which is also that this Name
   (as I have learned) is in the Phoenician Tongue, who^len;
   which by Interpretation is That which is Infinite, and Space;
   so that all is consonant with NUITH Our Lady of the Stars.
   Thus, o my Son, is the Word of Truth echoed throughout all
   Worlds; and thus have the Wise mighty Assurance in their Way.
   See, o my Son, that thou work not without this Guard
   inflexible, lest thou err in thy Perceptions.

   Thou wilt mark also that great Men are commonly great Lovers;

      My son, be fervent!  Be firm!  Be stable!  Be quick to make
   Impurity, how one Course of Ideas seeketh to infringe upon
   another, to quell the Virtue thereof.  Gold is pure, but to
   drink molten Gold were Impurity to thy Body, and its
   Destruction.  Law is a Code of the Customs of a People; if it
   intrude thereon to alter them, it is an Impurity of
   Oppression.  So also Diet is to be in Accord with Digestion;
   Ethics were an Impurity therein.  Love is an Expression of the
   Will of the Body, yea, and more also, of That which created
   the Body; and its Operation is commonly between One and One,
   so that the Interference of a Third Person is Impurity, and
   not to be endured.  Nay, even the thought of Third Person hath
   but ordinary not Part in Love; so that, as thou seest
   constantly in thy Life, Love being strong, taketh no heed of
   others, and some after Interference bringeth Misfortune.  Now

   then shell we therefore cast out Love, or accept Impurity

   write unto thee concerning the Virtue of this Rite, and many

   Truths, or true Relations, should be communicated in a magical

   awaken thy Wisdom, that it may manifest in thy conscious Mind.
   And this Way is of Use even when the Ceremonies, as those of
   the Christians, are corrupt and deformed; but in such a Case
   thou shalt seek out the true ancient Significance thereof.
   For there is that within thee which remembereth Truth, and is

   O my Son, our Work is to shine by Fore and Virtue of our own
   Natures without Consciousness or consideration.  Now,
   notwithstanding that our Radiance is constant and undimmed, it
   may be that Clouds gathering about us conceal our Glory from
   the Vision of other Stars.  These Clouds are our Thoughts; not
   those true Thoughts which are but conscious Expressions of our
   Will, such as manifest in our Poesy, or our Music, or other
   Flower-Ray of our Life quintessential.  Nay, the Cloud-Thought
   is born of Division and of Doubt; for all Thoughts, except
   they be creative emanations, are Witnesses to Conflict within

   us.  Our settled Relations with the Universe do not disturb
   our Minds, as, by Example, our automatic Functions, which
   speak to us only in the Sign of Distress.  Thus all

   which is the Root of Choronzon.

      So then, o my Son, there is my Wisdom, that the Voice of
   the Soul in its true Nature Eternal and Unchangeable,
   comprehending all Change, is Silence; and the Voice of the
   Soul, dynamic, in the Way of its Will, is song.  Nor is there
   any Form of utterance that is not, as song is, the Music
   proper to that Motion, according to the Law.  Thus, as thy
   Cousin Arthur Machen hath rejoiced to make plain unto Men in
   his Book called "Hieroglyphics", the first Quality of Art is its
   Ekstacy.  So, night to all Men at one Time or other, cometh
   Joy of Creation, with the Belief that their Utterance is holy
   and beautiful, glorious with Banners.  This would indeed be
   the Case, an we could discern their Thought from their Words;
   but because they have no technical Skill to express

   Thus, in a great War, all Speech soever may be understood as
   if it were of Reference thereunto; also, a Guilty Person, or a
   Melancholic may see in every Stranger an Officer of Justice,
   or one of them that are banded together to persecute him, as
   the Case may be.  But consider moreover that the Mysterious is
   always the Terrible, for Vulgar Minds.  How then when a New
   Word is spoken?  Either it is not heard, or it is
   misunderstood; and it evoketh Fear and Hate as a Reaction
   against Fear.  Then Men take him and set him at naught, and

   and any other Thing.  Learn well to apprehend this Mystery,
   for it is the Great Gate of the College of Understanding,
   whereby each and all of thy Senses become constant and
   perpetual Witnesses of the One Eucharist, whereunto also they
   are Ministers.  So then to thee every Phenomenon soever is the

   it is a necessary Rubric in this Ritual of Perfection.  Turn
   not therefore away thine Eyes, for that they are too pure to
   behold Evil; but look upon Evil with Joy, comprehending it in
   the Fervour of this Light that I have enkindled in thy Mind.
   Learn also that every Thing soever is Evil, if thou consider

   thou apprehend the Mystery of Change, for it is by Virtue of
   Change that this Truth of Beauty and Holiness is made

   things are in thine own Self, is the Unconscious.  How then?
   Because Men were already aware how this Unconscious, or
   Libido, is opposed, for the most Part , to the conscious Will.
   In the Salve-Ages this is a Truth Universal, or well night to
   it; for in such Times are Men compelled to Uniformity by the
   Constraint of Necessity herself.  Yea, of old it was a
   continual Siege of every Man of every Clan, of every
   Environment; and to relax guard was then Self-murdr, or also
   Treachery.  so then no Man might chose his way, until he were

   stepping stealthily, a certain Security against the grossest

   and enlarged the class of the Learned, until, as it is this
   day, only a small proportion of any man's work must needs go
   to the satisfaction of first will essential and common, the
   provision of shelter, food, and protection.  Verily, also thou
   seest many women made free to live as they will, even o the
   admiration and delight of the Sage whose eye laugheth to
   contemplate mischief.  Thus the duty of every Unit towards the
   whole is diminished, and also the necessity to conform with
   those narrow laws which preserve primitive tribes in their
   struggle against environment.  Thus the State need suppress
   only such heresies as directly threaten its political

   stability, only such modes of life as work manifest and proven

   variation in type must appear as a disaster; yea, intelligence
   itself must perforce prove its value to the brute, or he
   distrusteth it and destroyeth it.  Yet as thou knowest, that
   variation which is fitted to the environment is the salvation
   of the species.  Only among men, his fellows turn ever upon
   the Saviour, and rend him, until those who follow him in
   secret, and it may be unconsciously, prove their virtue and
   his wisdom by their survival when his persecutors perish in
   their folly.  But we, being secure against all primary enemies
   to the individual, or the common weal, may, nay, we must, if
   we would attain the summit for our race, devote all spare
   leisure, wealth, and energy to he creation of variation from
   the Norm, and thus by clear knowledge bought of experiment and
   of experience, move with eyes well open upon our true path.

   So therefore Our Law of Thelema is justified also of biology
   and of social science.  It is the true Way of Nature, the
   right strategy in the way of man with his environment, and the
   life of his soul.

      Sayst thou, o my son, that not thus, but by forced
   training, one cometh to perfection.  This indeed is sooth,
   that by artificial selection and well-watched growth and
   environment, one hath dogs, horses, pigeons, and the like,
   which excel their forebears in strength, in beauty, in speed,
   as one will.  Yet is this work but a false magical artifice,
   temporary and of illusion; for thy masterpieces are but
   monsters, not true variations, and if thou leave them, they
   revert swiftly to their own proper and authentic type, because
   that type was fitted by experience to its environment.  So
   every variation must be left free to perpetuate itself of
   perish, not cherished for its beauty, or guarded for its
   appeal to thine ideal, or cut off in thy fear thereof.  For
   the proof of its virtue lieth in the manifestation of its
   power to survive, and to reproduce itself after its kind.

   Nurse not the weakness of any man, nor swaddle and cosset him,
   not though he were poet or artist because of his value to thy

   enfeebled also.

      Now then thou seest that this Hell, or concealed place
   within thee, is no more a fear or hindrance to men of a free
   race, but the treasure house of the assimilated wisdom of the
   ages, and the knowledge of the True Way.  Thus are we just and
   wise to discover this secret in ourselves, to conform the
   conscious mind therewith.  For that mind is compact solely
   (until it be illuminated) of impressions and judgments, so
   that its will is but directed by the sum of the shallow
   reactions of a most limited experience.  But thy true will is
   the wisdom of the ages of thy generations, the expression of
   that which hath fitted thee exactly to thine environment.
   Thus thy conscious mind is oftentimes foolish, as when thou
   admirest an ideal, and wouldst attain it, but thy true will
   letteth thee, so that there is conflict, and the humiliation
   of that mind.  Here will I call to witness the common event of

   "Good Resolutions" that defy the lightning of destiny, being
   puffed up by the mind of an indigestible ideal putrefying
   within thee.  Thence cometh colic, and presently the poison is
   expelled, or else thou diest.  But resolutions of true will
   are mighty against circumstance.

      Learn moreover concerning this Hell, or hidden wisdom, that
   is within thee, that it is modified, little by little, through
   the experience of the conscious mind, which feedeth it.  For
   that wisdom is the expression, or rather symbol and
   hieroglyph, of the true adjustment of thy being to its
   environment.  Now, then, this environment being eroded by
   time, this wisdom is no more perfect, for it is not absolute,
   but standeth in relation to the Universe.  So then a part
   thereof may become useless, and atrophy as (I will instance
   this case) Man's wit of smell; and the bodily organ
   corresponding degeneratheth therewith.  But this is an effect
   of much time, so that in thy hell thou art like to find
   elements vain, or foolish, or contrary to thy present weal.
   Yet, o my Son, this hidden wisdom is not thy true will, but
   only the levers (I may say so) thereof.  Notwithstanding,

   there lieth therein a faculty of balance, whereby it is able
   to judge whether any element in itself is presently useful and
   benign, or idle and malignant.  Here then is a root of
   conflict between the conscious and the unconscious, and a
   debate concerning the right order of conduct, how the will may
   be accomplished.

      O my Son, in this case is there darkness, yet this comfort
   as a lamp therein, that there is no error in the will, but
   only doubt as to the means of success, else were we as
   children afeared of Night.  Thus we have need of naught but to
   consider the matter by wit of reason, and of prudence, and on
   common sense, and of experience, and of science, adjusting
   ourselves so far as we may.  Here is the key of success, and
   its name is the skill to make right use of circumstance. This,
   then is the virtue of the mind, to be the Wazir of the will, a
   true counsellor, through intelligence of the Universe.  But o,
   my Son, do thou lay this word beneath thine heart, that the
   mind hath no will, nor right thereto, so the Usurpation
   bringeth forth a fatal conflict in thyself.  For the mind is
   sensitive, unstable as air, and may be led foolishly in leash
   by a stronger mind that worketh as the cunning tool of a will.

   Therefore thy safety and defence is to hold thy mind to his
   right function, a faithful minister to thine own true will,
   but election of nature.  Heed well this, o my Son, for thy
   mind passive is rightly a mirror to reflect all things clearly
   without prejudice, and to remain unstained by them.

      Therefore consider this again in a figure, that thy mind is
   as the marshal of an army, to observe the dispositions of the
   enemy, and to order his own forces rightly, according to that
   information; but he hath no will, only obedience to the word
   of his king to outwit and to overcome the Opposite.  Nor doth
   that king make war by his own whim, if he be wise and true,
   but solely because of the necessity of his country, and its
   nature, whereof he is but executive officer and interpreter,
   its voice as the Marshal is its arm.  Thus then do thou
   understand thyself, not giving place to thy mind to dispute
   thy will, nor through ignorance and carelessness allowing the
   enemy to deceive thee, nor by fear, by imprudence and
   foolhardiness, by hesitation and vacillation, by disorder and
   the lack of firm correctness, by failure in elasticity or in
   obstinacy, each at its moment, suffering defeat in the hour of

   shock.  So, then, o my Son, this is thy work, to know the word
   of thy will without error, and to make perfect every faculty
   of thy mind, in right order and readiness to impose that word
   as law upon the Universe.  So mote it be!

      Is it not a marvel how he that worketh with his will and is
   in constant touch with the reality external, maketh his mind
   to serve him?  How eagerly runneth it and returneth,
   gathering, arranging, clarifying, classifying, organizing,
   comparing, setting in array, with skill and might and energy
   that faileth never!  Nay, my son, in this way thou canst be
   pitiless with thy mind, and it will not rebel against thee, or
   neglect thine Ordinance.  But now consider him that worketh
   not with his will, how his mind is idle, not reaching out
   after reality, but debating within itself of its own affairs,
   like a democracy, introspective.  Then this mind, not reacting
   equally and with elasticity to the world, is lost in its own
   anarchy and civil war, so that although it works not, it is

   overcome by weakness of division, and becometh Choronzon.  And
   unto these words I call to my witness the madness of the soul

   no truth, nor apprehension of truth, nor possibility of truth,
   only, if thou entrust this jewel unto them, they forthwith use
   it to thy loss and destruction.  But they are ware of thine
   own love of truth, and thy respect thereunto, so therefore
   they tempt thee, flattering with their lips, that thou betray
   thyself to them.  And they feign falsely, with every wile, and
   cast about for thy soul, until either in love or in wrath or
   in some other folly thereof, thou speak truth, profaning thy
   sanctuary.  So was it ever, and herein I call to my witness
   Samson of Timmath, that was lost by this error.  Now for any
   woman, any lie sufficeth; and think not in thine extremity

      The nature of woman, o my Son, is as thou hast learned in
   our most Holy Qabalah; and she is the clothing in sex of man,
   the magical image of his will to love.  Therefore was it said
   by thine uncle Wolfgang von Goethe:  Das Ewigweibliche zieht
   uns hinan.  But therefore also hath she no nature of truth,
   because she is but the Eidolon of an excitement and a going of
   thy star, and appertaineth not unto its essence and stability.
   So then to thee she is but matter and to her thou art but
   energy, and neither is competent to the formula of the other.
   Therefore also thy will is itself imperfection, as I have
   shewed thee aforetime, thou art not in the way of love except
   thou be dressed in that robe of thine which thou callest
   woman.  And thou canst not lure her to this action proper to
   her by thy truth; but thou shalt, as our grammar sayeth,
   assume the mask of the spirit, that thou mayst evoke it by

   sympathy.  But thou shalt appear in thy glory only when she is
   in thy power, and bewildered utterly by ecstasy.  This is a
   mystery, o my Son, and of old times it was declared in the
   fable of Scylla and Charybdis, which are the formula of the
   rock and the whirlpool.  Now then meditate thou strictly upon
   this most worthy and adorable arcanum, to thy profit and
   enlightenment.

      Let it be a treasure in thine heart, o my Son, this mystery

   with virile flight to thine august inheritance.  Behold the
   Beatific Vision is of two orders, and in the formula of the
   Rosy Cross it is of the Heart and is called Beauty; but in the
   formula of the silver star (id est, of the eye within the
   triangle) it is of the mind, and is called wonder.  Otherwise
   spoken, the former is of Art, a sensuous and creative
   perception; but the latter of science, and intellectual and
   intelligible insight.  Or again, in our Holy Qabalah, the one
   is of Tiphereth, the other of Binah, and in pure philosophy,
   this is a contemplation of the Cosmos, causal and dynamic, and
   that of its effect in static presentation.  Now this rapture
   of art is a virtue or triumph of Love in his most universal

   comprehension, but the ecstasy of science is a continual
   orgasm of light; that is, of the mind.  Thou sayest, o my
   Father, how may I attain to this fulness and perfection?  Art
   thou there, o my Son?  It is well, and blessed be the bed

   of the discharge between two vehicles of extreme difference of
   potentials.  But as I shewed formerly concerning love, how
   each such discharge bringeth either component more nigh to
   equilibrium, so is it in this other matter, and by experience
   thou comest constantly to integration of love (or what not)
   within thyself, just as all effort becometh harmonious and
   easy by virtue of practice.  Rememberest thou the first time
   thou was thrown into water, thy fear and thy struggles, and
   the vehemence of thy joy when first thou didst swim without
   support?  Then, little by little all violence dieth away,
   because thou art adjusted to that condition.  Therefore the

   fury of thine early victory in these arts magical and sciences
   is but the sign of thine own baseness and unworthiness, since
   the contrast or differential is so overwhelming to thee; but,
   becoming expert and adept, thou art balanced in the glory, and

   mine hand when I was in Gaul the beloved, at Montigny that is

   ventured herself from beneath the Cross Austral that she might
   seek me, to inspire and comfort me, and this was my reward
   from the masters, and consolation in the years of my sorrow.
   But the way that leadeth to the other form of this vision of
   beatitude, to with, science is Gana Yoga or Raja Yoga, of
   which I have written only here and there, as one who should
   throw great stones upon the earth in disorder, by default of
   building them nobly into a pyramid.  And of this do I heartily
   repent me, and ask of the God Thoth that he may give me

   (albeit at the eleventh hour) virtue and with that I may
   compose a true book upon these ways of union.  Thy first step,
   therefore, o my Son, is to attain unto Samadhi, and to urge
   thyself perpetually to repetition of thy successes therein,
   for it hat been said by philosophers of old that practice
   maketh perfect, and that manners, being the constant habit of
   life, maketh man.

   her eagerness of purity doth encompass me with its soft
   tenderness, and twineth about me with sweet scent so that my
   mind is enkindled with a gentle flame, luminous and subtle,
   and I write unto thee as in a dream; for in this enchantment
   of her devotion I am caught up cunningly into beautitude, with
   great joy of the Gods that have bestrewn my way with flowers,
   ay many flowers and herbs of magick and of holiness withal to
   match their beauty.  Nay, o my son, I will cease this epistle
   unto thee for awhile, that I may rest in the pleasure of this
   contemplation, for it is solace ineffable, and recreation like
   unto sleep among the mountains.  Yea, can I wish thee more

   like unto this to draw thee with her simplicity, and her
   embroidered silence?

      Think it not strange, my Son, that I, praising adultery,
   should praise also constancy and delight therein.  For this is
   to state ill thy question.  Herein is truth and wisdom
   concerning this matter, that so long as love be not wholly
   satisfied, and equilibrated by entire fulfilment and exchange,
   constancy is a point of thy concentration and adultery a
   division in thy will.  But when thou hast the summit and
   perfection of any work, of what worth is it to continue
   therein?  Hast thou two stomachs, as has a cow, to chew the
   cud of a digested love?  Yet, o my Son, this constancy is not
   of necessity a stagnation.  Hay, behold the body of our lady
   Nuith, therein are found twin suns, that revolve constantly
   about each other.  So also it may be in love, that two souls,
   meeting, discover each in the other such wealth and richness
   of light and love, and in one phase of life (or incarnation)

   or even in may, they exhaust not that treasure.  Or will I say
   that such are not in their degree and quality thrice
   fortunate.  But to persist in dulness, in satiety, and in
   mutual irritation and abhorrence, is contrary to the way of
   nature.  So therefore there is no rule in any such case, but
   the law shall give light to every one that hath it in his
   heart, and by that wisdom let him govern himself.

      Moreover, say not thou in thy syllogism that, since every
   change soever, be it the creation of a symphony, or a poem, or
   the putrefaction of a carcass, is an art of love, and since we
   are to make no difference between any thing and any other
   thing, therefore all changes are equal in respect of our
   praise.  For though this be a right conclusion in the term of
   thy comprehension as a master of the Temple, yet it is false
   in the eyes of the mind that hath not attained this
   understanding.  So therefore any change (or phenomenon)
   appeareth noble or base to the imperfect mind, according to
   its consonance and harmony with the will that governeth the
   mind.  Thus if it be thy will to delight in rythm and Oeconomy
   of words, the advertisement of a commodity may offend thee;
   but if thou art in need of that merchandise, thou wilt rejoice
   therein.  Praise then or blame aught, as seemeth good unto

   thee; but with this reflection, that thy judgment is relative
   to thine own condition, and not absolute.  This also is a
   point o tolerance, whereby thy shalt avoid indeed those things
   that are hateful or noxious to thee, unless thou canst (in our
   mode) win them by love, by withdrawing thine attention from
   them; but thou shalt not destroy them, for that they are
   without doubt the desire of another.

      Understand then heartily, o my son, that in the light of
   this my wisdom all things are one, being of the body or our
   Lady Nuith, proper, necessary and perfect.  There is then none
   superfluous or harmful, and there is none honourable or
   dishonourable more than another.  Lo!  In thine own body, the
   vile intestine is of more worth to thee than the noble hand or
   the proud eye, for thou canst lose these and live, but not
   that.  Esteem therefore a thing in relation to thine own will,
   preferring the ear if thou love musick, and the palate if thou
   live wine, but the essential organs of life above these.  Have
   respect also to the will of thy fellow, not hindering him in
   his way save as he may overly jostle thee in thine.  For by
   the practice of this tolerance thou shalt come sooner to the
   understanding of this equality of all things in our Lady
   Nuith, and so the high attainment of universal love.  Yet in

   thy partial and particular action, as thou art a creature of
   illusion, do thou maintain the right relation of one thing to
   another; fighting if thou be a soldier, or building if thou be
   a mason.  For if thou hold not fast this discipline and
   proportion, which alloweth its true will to every part of thy

      Alas, my son!  this hath been fatal constantly to many a
   man of noble aspiration, that these words were hidden from his
   understanding.  For there is a balance in all things and the
   body hath charter to fulfil his nature, even as the mind hath.
   So to repress one function is to destroy that proportion which
   is wholesome, and wherein indeed all health and sanity have
   consistency.  Verily, it is the art of life to develop each
   organ of body and mind, or, as I may say, each weapon of the
   will to its perfection, neither distorting any use, nor
   suffering the will of one part to tyrannize over that of
   another.  And this doctrine (be it accursed!) that pain and
   repression are wholesome and profitable in themselves is a lie
   born of sin and of ignorance, the false vision of the Universe
   and of its laws that is the basis of the averse formula of the
   Slain God.  It is true that on occassion one limb must be

   sacrificed to save the whole body, as when one cutteth away
   one hand that is bitten by a viper, or as when a man giveth
   his life to save his city.  But this is a right and natural
   subordination of the superficial and particular to the
   fundamental and general will, and moreover it is a case
   extraordinary, relating to accident or extremity, not in any
   wise a rule of life, or a virtue in its absolute nature.

   they make pretence to know a man's thought better than he doth
   himself, and to direct his will with more wisdom than he, and
   to make plans for his happiness.  And of all these the worst
   is he that sacrificeth himself for the weal of his fellows.
   He that is so foolish as not to follow his own will, how shall
   be be so wise as to pursue that of another?  If mine horse

   and comfort from his confidence that thou wilt not hinder him
   by thy superfluity of compassion.  Let me not begin to tell
   thee of the mischiefs that I have seen, whose root was in

      It is now expedient that I instruct thee concerning the
   Four Powers of the Sphinx, and firstly, that this most arcane
   of the Mysteries of Antiquity was never at any Period the Tool
   of the Slavegods, but a Witness of Horus through the dark Aeon
   of Osiris to His Light and Truth, His Force and Fire.  Thou
   canst by no means interpret the Sphinx in Terms of the Formula
   of the Slain God.  This did I comprehend even when as Eliphas
   Levi Zahed I walked up and down the Earth, seeking a
   Reconciliation of these Antagonisms, which was a Task
   impossible, for in that Plane they have Antipathy.  (Even so
   may no Man form a Square Magical of Four Units.)  But the
   Light of the New Aeon revealeth this Sphinx as the true Symbol
   of this our Holy Art of Magick under the Law of Thelema.  In
   Her is the equal Development and Disposition of the Forces of
   Nature, each in its Balanced Strength; also Her True Name has

   the Digamma for Phi, and endeth in Upsilon, not in Xi, so that
   Her Orthography is {Sigma }{Digamma }{Iota }{Nu }{Upsilon } whose Numeration is
   Six Hundred and Three Score and Six.  For the Root thereof is
   {Sigma }{Digamma }, which signifieth the Incarnation of the Spirit; and
   of Kin are not only the Sun, Our Father, but Sumer, where Man
   knew himself Man, and Soma, the Divine Potion that giveth Men
   Enlightenment, and Scin, Light Astral, and Scire also, by a
   far Travelling.  But especially is this Root hidden in Sus,
   that is of the Sow, Swine, because the Most Holy must needs
   take its Delight under the Omphalos of the Unclean.  But this
   was hidden by Wisdom in Order that the Arcanum should not be
   profaned during the Aeon of the Slain God.  But now it has
   been given unto me to understand the Heart of Her Mystery,
   wherefore, o my Son, by Right of the Great Love that I bear
   unto thee, I will inform thee thereof.

      Firstly, this Sphinx is a Symbol of the Coition of Our Lady
   BABALON with me THE BEAST in its Wholeness.  For as I am of
   the Lion and the Dragon, so is She of the Man and the Bull, in
   our Natures, but the Converse thereof in our Offices, as thou
   mayst understand by the Study of the Book of the Vision and
   the Voice.  It is thus a Glyph of the Satisfaction and
   Perfection of the Will and of the Work,  the completion of the
   True Man as the Reconcilor of the Highest with the Lowest, so
   for our Convenience conventionally to distinguish them.  This
   then is the Adept, who doth Will with solid Energy as the
   Bull, doh dare with fierce Courage as the Lion, doth know with
   swift Intelligence as the Man, and doth keep Silence with
   soaring Subtilty as the Eagle or Dragon.  Moreover, this
   Sphinx is an Eidolon of the Law, for the Bull is Life, the
   Lion is Light, the Man is Liberty, the Serpent Love.  Now then

   this Sphinx, being perfect in true Balance, yet taketh the
   Aspect of the Feminine Principle that so She may be partner of
   the Pyramid, that is the Phallus, pure Image of Our Father the
   Sun, the Unity Creative.  The Signification of this Mystery is
   that the Adept must be Whole, Himself, containing all Things
   in true Proportion, before he maketh himself Bride of the One
   Universal Transcendental, in its most Secret Virtue.  And now
   therefore, o my Son, comprehending this Mystery by thine
   Intelligence, I will write further unto thee of these your
   Beasts of Power.

      Concerning the Bull, this is thy Will, constant and
   unwearied, whose Letter is Vau, which is Six, the Number of
   the Sun.  He is therefore the Force and the Substance of thy
   Being; but besides this, he is the Hierophant in the Taro, as
   if this were said: "that thy Will leadeth thee unto the Shrine
   of Light."  And in the Rites of Mithras the Bull is slain, and
   his Blood poured upon the Initiate, to endow him with that
   Will and that Power of Work.  Also in the land of Hind is the
   Bull sacred to Shiva, that is God among that Folk, and is unto
   them the Destroyer of all Things that be opposed to Him.  And
   this God is also the Phallus, for this Will operateth through
   Love even as it is written in our Own Law.  Yet again, Apis
   the Bull of Khem hath Kephra the Beetle upon His tongue, which
   signifieth that it is by this Will, and by this Work, that the
   Sun cometh unto Dawn from Midnight.  All these Symbols are

   most similar in their Nature, save as the Slaves of the Slave-
   gods have read their own Formula into the Simplicity of Truth.
   For there is naught so plain that Ignorance and Malice may not
   confuse and misinterpret it, even as the Bat is dazzled and
   bewildered by the Light of the Sun.  See then that thou
   understand this Bull in Terms of the Law of this our Aeon of
   Life.

      Of this, Lion, o my Son, be it said that this is the
   Courage of thy Manhood, leaping upon all Things, and seizing
   them for their Prey.  His letter is Teth, whose Implication is
   a Serpent, and the Number thereof Nine, whereof is Aub, the
   secret Fire of Obeah.  Also Nine is of Jesod, uniting Change
   with Stability.  But in the "Book of Thoth" He is the Atu called
   Strength, whose Number is ELEVEN which is Aud, the Lifht Odic
   of Magick.  And therein is figured the Lion, even THE BEAST,
   and Our Lady BABALON with Her Hands upon His Mouth, that She
   may master Him.  Here I would have thee to mark well how these
   our Symbols are cognate, and flow forth the one into the
   other, because each Soul partaketh in proper Measure of the
   Mystery of Holiness, and is kin with his Fellow.  But now let
   me show how this Lion of Courage is more especially the Light
   in thee, as Leo is the House of the Sun that is the Father of

   Light.  And it is thus: that thy Light, conscious of itself,
   is the Source and Instigator of thy Will, enforcing it to
   spring forth and conquer.  Therefore also is his Nature strong
   with hardihood and Lust of Battle, else shouldst thou fear
   that which is unlike thee, and avoid it, so that thy
   Separateness should increase upon thee.  For this Cause he
   that is defective in Courage becometh a Black Brother, and to
   Dare is the Crown of all thy Virtue, the Root of the Tree of
   Magick.

      Lo!  In the firs of thine Initiations, when first the

   brought unto the Throne of Horus, the Lord of the Lion, and by
   Him enheartened against Fear. Moreover, in Minutum Mundum, the
   Map of the Universe, it is the Path of the Lion that bindeth
   the two Highest Faculties of thy Mind.  Again, it is Mau, the
   Sun at Brightness of high Noon, that is called the Lion, very
   lordly, in our Holy Invocation.  Sekhet our Lady is figured as
   a lioness, for that She is that Lust of Nuith toward Hadith
   which is the Fierceness of the Night of the Stars, and their
   Necessity; whence also is She true Symbol of thine own Hunger
   of Attainment, the Passion of thy Light to dare all for its
   Fulfilling.  It is then the Possession of this Quality which
   determineth thy Manhood; for without it thou art not impelled
   to Magick, and thy Will is but the Salve's Endurance and

   Patience under the Lash.  For this Cause, the Bull being of
   Osiris, was it necessary for the Masters of the Aeons to
   incarnate me as more especially a lion, and my Word is first
   of all a Word of Enlightenment and of Emancipation of the
   Will, giving to every Man a Sprint within Himself to determine
   His Will, that he may do that Will, and no more another's.

   the Lion should become conscious by means of the Man; for
   without this thou art but an Automaton.  This Man moreover
   maketh thee to understand and to adjust thyself with
   Environment, else being devoid of Judgment, thou goest blindly
   upon an headlong Path.  For every Star in his Orbit holdeth
   not his Way obstinately, but is sensitive to every other Star,
   and his true Nature is to do this.  Oh how many are they whom
   I have seen persisting in a fatal Course, in Sway of the
   Belief that their dead Rigidity was Exercise of Will.  And the

      Threefold is the Nature of Live, Eagle, Serpent, and

   Lion of Light and of Courage within him, seemeth to himself
   encircled by Fire, and, driving his Sting into himself, he
   dieth.  Such are the Black Brothers, that cry: I am I, they
   that deny Love, restricting it to their own Nature.  But the
   Serpent is the secret Nature of Man, that is Life and Death,
   and maketh his Way through the Generations in Silence.  And
   the Eagle is that Might of Live which is the Key of Magick,
   uplifting the Body and its Appurtenance unto high Ekstacy upon
   his Wings.  It is by Virtue thereof that the Sphinx beholdeth
   the Sun unwinking, and confronteth the Pyramid without Shame.
   Our Dragon, therefore, combining the Natures of the Eagle and

      See now our Sphinx, with what Subtility and Art is She made
   Whole!  Here is thy Light, the Lion, the Necessity of thy
   Nature, fortified by thy Life, the Bull, the Power of Works,
   and guided by thy Liberty, the Man, the Wit to adapt Action to
   Environment.  These are three Virtues in One, necessary to all
   proper Motion, as I may say in a Figure, the Lust of the
   Archer, the propulsive Force of his Arm, and the equilibrating
   and directing Control of his Eye.  Of these three if one fail,
   the Mark is not hit. But hold!  Is not a Fourth Element
   essential in the Work?  Yea, soothly, all were vain without
   the Engine, Arrow and Bow.  This Engine is thy Body, possessed
   by thee and used by thee for thy Work, yet not Part of thee,

   mark thou well how all these interfuse, so that thou mayst

      But now concerning Silence, o my Son, I will have a further
   Word with thee.  For thereby we mean not the Muteness of him
   that hath a dumb Devil.  This Silence is the Dragon of thine
   unconscious Nature, not only the Ekstacy or Death of thine Ego
   in the Operation of its Organ, but also, in its Unity with thy
   Lion, the Truth of thy Self.  Thus is thy Silence the Way of
   the Tao, and all Speech a deviation thereform.  This Lion and
   Dragon are therefore of thy Self, and the Man and the Bull the
   Feminine Counterparts thereof, being the Grace of Our Lady
   BABALON that She bestoweth upon thee in thine Adultery with
   Her.  They are then as a Vesture of Honour, and a Reward, that
   are won by the Intensity of thy Light and of thy Love.  So
   perperly we esteem Men by the Measure of their Intelligence
   and their Strength, since they are equal in their essential
   Godhead, so far as concerneth the Quality thereof.  See thou

   closely moreover into it, that if thou be well favoured of Our
   Lady, thy Lion and thy Dragon grow in like Measure, forthe
   Excess of the Feminine is Dead Weight.  The Intellectual
   without Virility is a Dreamer of Follies, and the laborious
   Giant without Courage is a Slave.

      The Nature of this Silence is shewn also by the God

   and the Egg, that is, the Holy Ghost.  This is the most secret
   of all Energies, the Seed of all being, and therefore must He
   be sealed up in an Ark from the Malice of the Devourers.  If
   then by thine Art thou canst conceal thyself in thine own
   Nature, this is Silence, this, and not Nullity of
   Consciousness else were a Stone more perfect in Adeptship that
   thou.  But, abiding in thy Silence, thou art in a City of
   Refuge, and the Waters prevail not against the Lotus that
   enfoldeth thee.  This Ark or Lotus is then the Body of Our
   Lady BABALON, without which thou weret the Prey of Nile and of
   the Crocodiles that are therein.  Now, o my Son, mark thou
   well this that I will write for thine Advertisement and
   Behoof, that this Silence, though it be Perfection of Delight,

   is but the Gestation of thy Lion, and in thy Season thou must

   this is the Root of the while Mystery of Evil.  For he hath in
   him the Magick Power, which if he use not, he is self-
   poisoned, even as any Organ of the Body that refuseth its
   Function.  So then his Cure is in his Ally the Lion, that
   feareth not the Crocodiles, nor hideth himself, but leapeth
   eagerly forward.  The Path of the Mystic hath this Pitfall;
   for though he unite himself with his God, his Mode is to
   withdraw from that which him seemeth is not God.  Whereby he
   affirmeth and confirmeth the Demon, that is Duality.  Be thou
   instant therefore, o my Son, to turn from every Act of Love at

   Strength and Stability to my Spiritual Essence.  Uranus was
   ascending in the Lion, to fortify my Magical Will with
   Courage, and to turn it to the Salvation of Man.  In the
   Waterman was Saturnus, to make mine Intelligence sober,
   profound, and capable of Labour.  Jupiter, with Mercury His
   Herald, was in Scorpio, harmonizing me and my Word according
   to the Essence of my Nature.  Then of the others, Mars was
   exalted in the Goat, for physical Endurance of Toil; Sol was
   conjoined with Venus in the Balance, for judgment in Art and
   in Life, and for Equability of Temple.  Lastly, the Moon was

   And at this was she confounded and brought into Bewilderment;
   but after a great While, fumbling in her Mind, made Answer,
   like a Scarecrow in a Field, so was it for Rags and Tatters of

   for his Disciple in Magick.  And he was instant with me in
   this Matter, and vehement, adjuring his Gods that this (which

   concerning the Nature of Woman.  But I being but a Youth, and

   Men, but pass only as Images upon a Speculum.  So then a Woman
   advanceth never in Magick, but remaineth the same, rightly or
   wrongly ordered according to the Force that moveth Her.  Here
   therefore is the Limit of Her Aspiration in Magick, to abide
   joyous and obedient beneath the Man that her Instinct shall

   her Fitness a Man-soul.  For this Cause hath Man esteemed
   Constancy and Patience as Qualities preeminent in Good women,

   Her Ordeal therefore is principally to resist Moods, which

   Fifteenth, and put his Image in the Front of my Book, the
"   ""Ritual of High Magick", which was the second Part of my Thesis
   for the Grade of Major Adept, when I was clothed about with
   the Body called Alphonse Louis Constant.  Now the Goat flieth
   not as doth the Eagle; but consider this also that it is the
   true Nature of Man to dwell upon the Earth, so that his
   Flights are oft but Phantasy; yea, the Eagle also is bound to
   his Eyrie, nor feedeth upon Air.  Therefore this goat, making
   each leap with Fervour, yet all Times secure in his own

   Element, is a true Hieroglyph of the Magician.  Mark also,
   this Path sheweth One continuous in Exaltation upon a Throne,
   and so is it the Formula of the Man, as the other was of the
   Woman.

      I say furthermore that this Path is of the Circle, and of
   the Eye of Horus that sleepeth not, but is vigilant.  The
   Circle is all-perfect, equal every Way, but the Vesica hath
   bitter Need, and seeketh thy Medicine, that is of right
   compounded for High Purpose, to ease her Infirmity.  Thus is
   thy Will frustrated, and thy Mind distracted, and thy Work
   lamed, if it be not brought to Naught.  Also thy Puissance in
   thine Art isminished, by a full Moiety, as I do esteem it.
   But the Eye of Horus hath no Need, and is free in his Will,
   not seeking a Level, or requiring a Medicine, and is fit and
   worthy to be the Companion and the Ally of thee in thy Work,
   as a Friend to thee, not Mistress and not Slave, that seek
   ever with Slyness and Deceit to encompass their own Ends.
   There is moreover a Reason in Physics for my Word; study thou
   this matter in the Laws of the Changes of Nature.  For Things

   increase mutually the Potential of their particular Natures.

   for Seven Years' Space, eating Grass as doth an Ox.  Now this
   Ox is the Letter Aleph, and is that Atu of Thoth whose Number
   is Zero, and whose name is Maat, Truth, or Maut, the Vulture,
   the All-Mother, being an Image of Our Lady Nuith, but also it

      Now for the Chief of that which was granted unto me, it was
   the Apprehension of those willed Changes or Transmutations of
   the Mind which lead into Truth, being as Ladders unto Heaven,
   or so I called them at that Time, seeking for a Phrase to
   admonish the Scribe that attended on my Words, to grave a
   Balustre upon the Stele of of my Working.  But I make Effort
   in vain, o my Son, to record this matter in Detail; for it is
   the quality of the Grass to quicken the Operation of Thought
   it may be Thousandfold, and moreover to figure each Step in
   Images complex and overpowering in Beauty, so that one hath no
   Time wherein to conceive, much less to utter, any Word for a
   Name or any of them.  Also, such was the multiplicity of these
   Ladders, and their Equivalence, that the Memory holdeth no
   more any one of them, but only a certain Comprehension of the
   Method, wordless by Reason of its Subtilty.  Now therefore

   must I make by my Will a Concentration mighty and terrible of
   my Thought, that I may bring forth this Mystery in Expression.
   For this Method is of Virtue and Profit, by it mayst thou come
   easily and with Delight to the Perfection of Truth, it is no
   Odds from what Thought thou makest the first Leap in thy

      I believe generally, on Ground both of Theory and
   Experience, so little as I have, that a Man must first be
   initiate, and established in Our Law, before he may use this
   Method.  For in it is an Implication of our Secret
   Enlightenment, concerning the Universe, how its Nature is
   utterly Perfection.  Now every Thought is a Separation, and
   the Medicine of that is to marry Each One with its
   Contradiction, as I have shewed formerly in many Writings.
   And thou shalt clap the one to the other with Vehemence of
   Spirit, swiftly as Light itself, that the Ecstasy be
   spontaneous.  So therefore it is Expedient that thou have
   travelled already in this Path of Antithesis, knowing
   perfectly the Answer to every Griph or Problem, and thy Mind
   ready therewith.  For by the Property of this Grass all
   passeth with Speed incalculable of Wit, and an Hesitation

   should confound thee, breaking down thy ladder, and throwing
   back thy Mind to receive Impression from Environment, as at
   thy first beginning.  Verily; the nature of this Method is
   Solution, and the Destruction of every Complexity by Explosion
   of Ecstasy, as every Element thereof is fulfilled by its
   Correlative, and is annihilated (since it loseth separate
   Existence) in the Orgasm that is consummated within the Bed of
   thy Mind.

      Thou knowest right well, o my Son, how a Thought is
   imperfect in two Dimensions, being separate from its
   Contradiction, but also constrained in its Scope, because by
   that Contradiction we do not (commonly) complete the Universe,
   save only that of its Discourse.  Thus if we contrast health
   with Sickness, we include in their Sphere of Union no more
   than one Quality that may be predicated of all Things.
   Furthermore, it is for the most Part not easy to find or to
   formulate the true Contradiction of any Thought as a positive
   Idea, but only as a Formal Negation in vague Terms, so that
   the ready Answer is but the Antithesis.  Thus to "White" one
   putteth not the Phrase "all that which is not white", for this
   is void, formless, neither clear, simple, nor positive in
   conception; but one answereth "BBlack", for this hath an Image
   of his Significance.  So the Cohesion of Antitheticals

   destroyeth them only in Part, and one becometh instantly
   conscious of the Residue that is unsatisfied or unbalanced,
   whose Eidolon leapeth in thy Mind with Splendour and Joy
   unspeakable.  Let not this deceive thee, for its Existence
   proveth its Imperfection, and thou must call forth its Mate,
   and destroy them by Love, as with the former.  This Method is
   continuous and proceedeth ever from the Gross to the Fine, and
   from the Particular to the General, dissolving all Things into
   the One Substance of Light.

      Lean now that Impression of Sense have Opposites readily
   conceived, as long to short, or light to dark; and so with
   Emotions and Perceptions, as Love to Hate, or false to true;
   but the more violent is the Antagonism, the more is it bound
   in Illusion, determined by Relation.  Thus the Word "Long"
   hath no Meaning save it be referred to a Standard; but Love is
   not thus obscure, because Hate is its Twin, partaking
   bountifully of a Common Nature therewith.  Now, hear this; it
   was given unto me in my Visions of the Aethyrs, when I was in
   the Wilderness of Sahara, by Tolga, that above the Abyss,
   contradiction is Unity, and that Nothing could be true save by
   Virtue of the Contradiction that is contained in itself.
   Behold, therefore, in this method thou shalt come presently to
   Ideas of this Order, that include in themselves their own
   Contradiction, and have no Antithesis.  Here then is thy Lever
   of Antinomy broken in thine Hand; yet, being in true Balance,

   propel thee, and the Emancipation from the Fetters of Thought

      This is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this Holy Herb,

   escaped the Focus of the Lens of mine Understanding.  Yea, o

   of an Artist in his Presentation thereof, when else we were
   blind thereunto; lacking his Mode of Light.  Yet were that Art

      How shall the measure our Statue and our Success by that
   Cannon of Relation and Illusion, and their ignorance of our

   outweigheth an Age of Darkness.  What is Happiness but the
   Issue of the Harmony of our Consciousness with our Truth, and
   the Conformity of Will with Action?  To the Initiate is
   Certainty of his Fulfilment, which to the Profane is but the
   Effect of Hazard, and he feareth to lose what he loveth, or
   thinketh he loveth.  But we, loving only in Light, suffer not
   by Fear or by Bereavement, because to us every Event is
   Welcome, being right, necessary and proper to our particular
   Path.  The Knowledge of this one Matter is the End of Dread
   and of Regret; make it the Governor of thy Mind, to rule its

      O my Son, is it not a marvel, this Light whereof we are the

   Hadith, so that the Gnostic Sacrament of the Cosmos is

   comprehend its Mystery, and its Order in this High Mass
   eternally celebrated among us, acknowledging the Perfection of
   the Rite, neither confusing the Parts thereof, nor
   discriminating in Worship between them.  So unto us is every
   Phenomenon a Shew of Godliness, proceeding continually in a
   Pageant that returneth unto itself, identical in the Phase of
   Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia of Ineffable
   Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of Beauty in
   Variety inexhaustible.  Shall the Initiate bestir him, to
   better so prime a Perfection?  Nay, this Will that was his is

   accomplished; he hath attained the Summit; so without Hope or
   Fear he abideth, and leaveth his Vehicle of Illusion and

      Thou hast made Question of me concerning Death, and this is
   my Opinion, of which I say not: this is the Truth.  First in
   the Temple called Man is the God, his Soul, or Star,
   individual and eternal, but also inherent in the Body of Our
   Lady Nuith.  Now this Soul, as an Officer in the High Mass of
   the Cosmos, taketh on the Vesture of his Office, that is,
   inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Illusion, a Body and Mind.  And
   this Tabernacle is Subject to the Law of Change, for it is
   complex, and diffuse reacting to every Stimulus or Impression.
   If then the mind be attached constantly to the Body, Death
   hath no Power to decompose it wholly, but a decaying Shell of
   the dead Man, his Mind holding together for a little his Body
   of Light, haunteth the Earth, seeking a new Tabernacle (in its
   Error that feareth Change) in some other Body.  These Shells
   are broken away utterly from the Star that did enlighten them,

   and they are Vampires, obsessing them that adventure
   themselves into the Astral World without Magical Protection,
   or invoke them, as do the Spiritists.  For by Death is Man
   released only from the Gross Body, at the first, and is
   complete otherwise upon the Astral Plane, as he was in his
   Life.  But this Wholeness suffereth Stress, and its Gidrirs
   are loosened, the weaker first and after that the stronger.

      consider now in this Light what shall come to the Adept, to
   him that hath aspired constantly and firmly to his Star,
   attuning the Mind unto the Musick of its Will.  In him, if his
   Mind be knit perfectly together is itself, and conjoined with
   the Star, is so strong a Confection that it breaketh away
   easily not only from the Gross Body, but the fine.  It is this
   Fine Body which bindeth it to the Astral, as did the Gross to
   the Material World so then it accomplisheth willingly the
   Sacrament of a second Death and leaveth the Body of Light.
   But the Mind, cleaveth closely, by Right of its Harmony, and
   Might of its Love, to its Star, resisteth the Ministers of
   Disruption, for a Season, according to its Strength.  Now, if
   this Star be of those that are bound by the Great Oath,
   incarnating without Remission because of Delight in the Cosmic
   Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle in the appointed Way, and

   indwelleth the Foetus of a Child, and quickeneth it.  And if
   at this Time the mind of its Former Tabernacle yet cling to
   it, then is there Continuity Character, and it may be Memory
   between the two Vehicles.  This is, briefly and without
   Elaboration, the Way of Asar in Amenti, according to mine

   setteth us to Magick, the Pain of the Conscious Mind.  Having
   then Wit to find the Cause of this Pain in the Sense of
   Separation, and its Cessation by the Union of Live, it is the
   Summit of our Holy Art to present the whole Being of our Star
   to Our Lady in the Nuptial of our Bodily Death.  We are then
   to make our whole Engine the true and real Appurtenance of our
   Force, without Leak, or Friction, or any other Waste or
   Hindrance to its Action.  Thou knowest well how an Horse, or
   even a Machine propelled by a Man's feet, becometh as it were
   as Extension of the Rider, though his Skill and Custom.  Thus
   let thy Star have profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating it, and

   this even in Life, but most especially in Death.  Also thou
   oughtest to increase thy Vehicle in Mass by true Growth in

      There is a certain Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis
   concerning Will that it should flow freely in its Way: namely
   that for such as I am it is well, because I am endowed by
   Nature with a Lust insatiable in any Kind, so that the
   Universe itself seemeth incapable to appease it.  For I have
   poured myself out unceasingly, in Bodily Passion, and in
   Battles with Men, and with Wild Beasts, and with Mountains and
   Deserts, and in Poetry and other Writings of the Musick of
   mine Imagination, and in Books of our own Mysteries, and in
   Works Magical, and so forth, so that in Mine Age I am become
   verily a Slave to mine own Genius and my Law is that unless I
   sleep or create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim the Reward
   and the Recreation of my Death.  But (I hear thee say it) this
   is not the Case of All, or even of many Men; but their Act of
   Will is satisfied easily at its first Guerdon.  Should not

   then their Wisdom be to resist themselves for a Space, as
   Water heaped up by a Dam gathereth Force, and Hunger feedeth
   upon Abstinence?  Also, there is that which I have written in
   a former Chapter of the right Use of Discipline; and thirdly,
   this free Flowing is without Subtility of Art, as it were an

      Here therefore will I write down the Answer to this
   Indictment of our Wisdom; that every Act of Will is to be made
   in its Perfection, which State is to be attained according to
   these Conditions: firs, those of its own Law; second, those of
   its Environment.  Judge thine own Case individually, each as
   it pleadeth; for there is no Cannon or Code, since every Star
   hath its own Law diverse from every other.  Now there is the
   Restraint of Conflict which is Impotance and Disruption; the
   the Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by
   Repose and by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his Armies,
   and feedeth them, and looketh to their Furniture and to their
   Spirit, before he joineth the Battle.  Also, there is the
   Restraint of Art, which includeth that other of Discipline,
   and its Nature is to adorn the Will and to admire its Strength
   and its Beauty, and to enjoy its Victory by Anticipation in

   full Confidence, not fearful of Time that robbeth them that
   are ignorant concerning him, how he is but Mirage and
   Illusion, incapable to besiege the Fortress of the Soul.  Work
   thou thy Will, as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphas
   Levi Zahed, knowing thyself Omnipotent, and thine Habitation

      Subtler than the Serpent of Hermes, o my Son, is this Way
   of Restraint of Art, and thou shalt meet therein with the God
   Pan, and have him to thy Playmate.  So shalt thou devise
   Comedy and Tragedy, as it were Settings for the Jewel of thy
   Will, to enhance the Beauty thereof, and to refine thy
   Pleasures.  This is that which is written in "The Book of the""

   joy.  Be not animal; refine thy rapture!  If thou drink, drink
   by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed by

   thy tamed Devil of Sin, and use the Pain thereof to sharpen
   the taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and thy Tongue keen to the
   Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is opposite to
   this in his Preference; or as a skilled Match of Love

   aboundeth in Pinchings, Slappings, Bitings and the like, to
   intensify the Bout and to prolong it.  But this is Risk and
   Peril unless thou be wholly Master, one in thy Will; for there
   is Poison in these dead Snakes, to destroy thee if thou lend
   them of thy Life by so little as one Doubt of thyself, as a

      In this Mystery of the Restraint of Art is also the Secret

   this is the Play of Her Love, that She veileth Her Beauty in

   and allurements in Her Dance.  Now, o my Son, the full

   if this be prepared by the Experience of this Art in thine own
   Case.  But to them that understand not, and have Grief and
   Separation, being deceived by this Play so that they deem it
   the Division of Hate, She can but speak in Simplicity by that
   Word written in "The Book of the Law": "To me!"  For until thou

   Cruelty indeed, except thou know it to be but a Sauce to wet

      O my Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but

   Delight, that Sin should appear, and also (Mark thou well!)
   the Misapprehension of its Nature.  Therefore the Pain of any
   Sinner in his Division and His Separation is to Her a little
   Spasm of Pleasure.  But as for him, let him apprehend this
   Doctrine, and dissolve himself in Her Love.  Thou then, being
   Initiate and Illuminated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own
   Sorrow, or rather that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy
   that thou hast in thy True Self, the Star among the Stars of

   the Apprehension of their Images in mind through Sense; as,
   how is Colour Real or Material to a blind may or a Law

   things therefore exist in one form or another; but the Reality
   of any, though in itself absolute, is in regard of its

   Ornament.  For it is the Child of my Love toward thee, and the
   Expression through mine Art of my Will so far as that
   regardeth thee.  Now every Child is made of the Essence of his
   Father, so that every Creation is a Likeness or image of the
   Creator, but modified by the Mother, that is to say, the
   Material whereon he begetteth it.  So then this Letter is a
   Projection of mine own Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in
   thy Regard; and it shall be unto thee as a clear Vision of thy
   Father, and of the Word of the Aeon that he hath uttered unto
   Man.  But also, because this Word is the Formula of the Aeon,
   that is the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, the Equation that
   expresseth its Energy and its Motion, it shall serve every Man
   in his Measure as a Text-Book or Comment upon the Theorick and
   Praxis of Magick.  By it may he discover his true Nature, and

   its Will, and apply his Force and his Intelligence to the
   right Fulfilment thereof.  It shall be a beacon to enlighten
   him, to comfort him, and to direct him; and it shall be a
   Witness and Memorial of my Word and of my Work, as of mine
   Attainment unto Wisdom.

      There is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ with
   mine own Hand and Style, slowly and heedfully (as is contrary
   with my custom) being the Fruit of the Tree of my Mediation,
   well-ripened by the Sun of mine Illumination.  With much Toil
   have I done this, being oftentimes seated without Motion save
   of the Hands, while Earth rolled from Twilight unto Twilight,
   so that my Body became cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse.
   Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, have I been given to
   Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably the Mass of
   the Holy Ghost, in the Concentration of my Will to impart this
   Wisdom unto thee, and to reveal the Mysteries of Truth.  Now
   of all these this is the Root, that Truth is not fixed with
   the Rigour of Death, but vital with Lust of Change, and
   enflamed with the Love of its opposite.  Thus even Falsehood
   is not alien to Truth, for the Perfection of Nature

   comprehendeth all.  But all these Things are written in "The""
   ""Book of the Law", after which do I limp painfully; afar off,
   upon the poor Crutch of mine Understanding of its Word; yea, I
   am well assured that in that Book are writ all Things soever;
   but we, being mostly without Wit are not able to distinguish
   them.  For the Stature of Aiwass is beyond our Measure, seeing
   that he was able to comprehend the whole Mystery of Nuith and
   of Hadith, and yet to declare Their Message in the Language of
   Man.

      O my Son, in this the Colophon of my Epistle will I recall
   the Title and Superscription thereof; that is, "The Book of""
   ""Wisdom or Folly".  I proclaim Blessing and Worship to Nuith Our
   Lady and Her Lord Hadith, for the Miracle of the Anatomy of
   the Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as it is shewn in the Design Minutum
   Mundum, the Tree of Life.  For though Wisdom be the Second
   Emanation of his Essence, there is a Path to separate and to
   join them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that is One
   indeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full
   Orthography; to signify the Most Holy Trinity, and by
   Metathesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death.  This is
   also the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the Root-Sound of
   OMNE, or, in Greek, PAN, and it is a Number of the Sun.  Yet
   is the Atu of Thoth that correspondeth thereunto marked with
   ZERO, and its Name is MAT, whereof I have spoken formerly, and

   its Image is the Fool.  O my Son, gather thou all these Limbs
   together in One Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit,
   that it may live; then do thou embrace it with Lust of they
   Manhood, and go in unto it, and know it; so shall ye be One
   Flesh.  Now at last in the Reinforcement and Ecstasy of this
   Consummation thou shalt with by what Inspiration thou didst
   choose thy Name in the Gnosis, I mean PARZIVAL, "der reine
   Thor", the True Knight that won Kingship in Monsalvat, and
   made whole the Wound of Amfortas, and ordered Kundry to right
   Service, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle of
   the Sangral; yea















   also upon himself did he accomplish his Work in the End:
   "Hochsten Heiles Wunder!  Erlosung dem Erloser !"  This is the
   last Word of the Song that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for
   Worship of this Mystery.  Understand thou this, o my son, as I
   take leave of thee in this Epistle, that the Summit of Wisdom
   is the opening of the Way that leadeth unto theCrown and
   Essence of all, to the Soul of the Child Horus, the Lord of
   the Aeon.  This Way is the Path of the Pure Fool.  Amoun.

      And who is this Pure Fool?  Lo, in the Sagas of Old Time,
   Legend of Scald, of Brad, of Druid, cometh He not in Green
   Like Spring?  O thou Great Fool, thou Water that art Air, in
   whom all Complex is resolved!  Yes, thou in ragged Raiment,
   with the Staff of Priapus and the Wineskin!  thou standest up
   on the Crocodile, like Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat
   leapeth upon thee!  Yea, and more also I have known Thee who
   Thou art, Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy Name I A O !
   Now at the End of all do I come to the Being of Thee, beyond
   By-coming, and I cry aloud my Word, as it was given unto Man
   by thine Uncle Alcofribas Masior, the Oracle of the Bottle of
   BACBUC, and this Word is T R I N C.


                    Love is the law, love under will.
