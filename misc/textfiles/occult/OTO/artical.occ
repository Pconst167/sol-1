        There are doubtlessly readers of this article that believe I have 
        no ethics.  Those readers are intitled to there opinion however 
        shallow I may feel that opinion is.

        I am the High Priest of Covenant Of The Doves, the comments I make 
        here are necessarily my personal ethics and viewpoint and not that 
        of my High Priestess or members of the Coven.  Even as a leader 
        of a coven, I have no right or power to speak for another  
        person.  They do however necessarily govern my actions as a High 
        Priest.

        The only way I know to state my ethical viewpoint is by a 
        annotated resitation of the Laws of the Craft of the Wise as they 
        pertain to ethics and have been revealed to me by my teachers, 
        the writings of others and that which the Lord and Lady have made 
        clear to me through their visions and actions.

        I bear the mundane name Crowley that has a certain significance 
        in the craft community beyond my personal contributions.  Yes, I 
        am prowed of the legacy of that name as members of my family have 
        played important parts in history.  Aleister Crowley was by no 
        means the most important of them nor the least.  

        Aleister Crowley, the Current Lord Crowley and myself all bear 
        common accestors to Sir Ambrose Crowley, Lord Mayor of London (at 
        the time of Cromwell) and author of the 'Law Book of the Crowley 
        Iron Works' which is considered to be the bases of British 
        statutory law.  This, I hope  will clear up confusion about my 
        relationship to Aleister Crowley.

        The name Hearth Witch is far more dear to me than Crowley, as it 
        represents a true understanding of what the WICCA is.  When an 
        astronaut looks out of the window of his space capsule and sees 
        the body of our Lady looking back at him.  The astronaut knows, 
        in that moment that technology, and the centuries of mans' labor 
        that put him there, are pale when compared to the wonders of our 
        Lady.

        I feal that it is necessary to explain some of the structure of 
        the Covenant of the Doves.  We say that we have one degree but 
        that is not strictly true. There are 4 things that happen to a 
        person on the pathway.  We cannot call them degrees as they do 
        not happen in the same order to each person.

             1.   Dedication to the coven.

             2.   Initiation by the God and Goddess

             3.   Worldly recognition of their Initiation by the Gods
                  and their ability to act as a Priest or Priestess

             4.   Birth or Adoption into the family which is as permanent 
                  and unrevokable as the Initiation of the Lord and Lady.

        THE WITCH 'LAW'

                 Do not what you desire -
                    do what is necessary.
                 Take all you are given -
                    give all of yourself.
                 "What I have - - - I hold."
                 When all else is lost, and not until then,
                    prepare to die with dignity. 

        There are two kinds of law, Law of Tribe and the Law of Goddess 
        (ie: natural law).  The Law of Tribe requires the services of a 
        Priesthood.  The Law of the Goddess require no Priesthood as they 
        are self-inforcing.  If you see an apparent violation of the law 
        of the Goddess, there are only two possible explanations.   The 
        law is not of the Goddess but of man, or you do not understand 
        that law of the Goddess.  If you see a ball fall up, either 
        someone is deceiving you, or you are in a spacecraft or similar 
        artificial  environment that is manifesting some of the "fine 
        print" in the law of the Goddess.  This partial telling of the 
        laws contain both the law of the tribe and that of the Goddess.  
        It is left to the wisdom of the student to learn which is which. 

        THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COVEN

        The High Priestess must be an ordained Nymph or a Crone.
        The High Priest must be an ordained Magician.

        The High Priestess is the final word on the quality of Worship as 
        the High Priest is the final word on the quality of Magick within 
        the WICCA Circles.

        The High Priest's relationship is:  Father, Brother, and Lover.

        The Priestess's relationship is: Mother, Sister, and Lover.

        THE PRIEST AND PRIESTESS ARE THE LEADERS OF THE COVEN IN THE 
        MUNDANE WORLD, NOT IT'S DICTATORS. MEMBERS MUST BE GIVEN A VOICE 
        IN THE ACTIONS OF THE COVEN.

        The Covenant of the Doves is necessarily a theocracy not a 
        democracy.  Meetings are opened to all who are dedicated and 
        sometimes to concered outsiders.  Whatever the business, it is 
        open to discussion by all.  There are no votes taken because when 
        it is all said and done, there are only two people in the coven 
        that bear the responsibility for the actions of this coven, the 
        High Priestess and the High Priest.  So, the final decision is 
        theirs ALONE.  

        When the Circle is cast by The Priest and Priestess, they are 
        necessarily the ABSOLUTE RULERS OF THE COVEN.  No witch shall 
        enter the Circle with out PERFECT LOVE AND PERFECT TRUST in all 
        members of the Circle.  The only question of the order of the 
        Priest or Priestess is: if told to jump, it is permissable to ask 
        how high -- on the way up.  

        IF ONE DISAGREES WITH THE DESISION OF THE LEADERS OF ANY COVEN OR 
        CIRCLE.  IT IS THERE RIGHT AND DUTY TO LEAVE THE COVEN.  THERE IS 
        NO OTHER LAWFUL RECOURSE.

        LEADERS MUST BE EVERMINDFUL THAT MEMBERS WILL SOON LEAVE AN 
        UNJUST LEADER.

        THE LAW OF THE COVEN

        THE CIRCLE IS A PLACE THAT IS NOT A PLACE, BETWEEN THE WORLDS.  

        A COVEN IS A FULLY AUTONOMOUS UNIT ANSWERABLE TO NO POWER BEYOND 
        ITS OWN, SAVE THE LORD AND LADY.

        IN ANY DISPUTE WITHIN THE FAMILY (COVEN) OR TRIBE, NO ONE MAY 
        INVOKE ANY LAW BUT THOSE OF THE FAMILY AND TRIBE.

        It being known that the Circle is a "place that is not a place, 
        between the worlds", and that what is between the Worlds does not 
        concern the World.  Dicussion of actions taking place within a 
        consecrated circle is appropriate for dicussion only within that 
        Circle, or by Elders of the Craft in a Council of Elders Convened 
        by the High Priest and High Priestess of the coven involved as 
        only Elders can or should have any direct knowledge of actions 
        that take place within the Circle of another Coven.  

        With the fragmentation of the WICCA since the burning times, the 
        identification of Elders of the Craft is at best ambiguous.  The 
        only working definition that I can feel comfortable with is:  
        Those members of the WICCA community that the High Priest and 
        High Priestess of the Coven recognize as their peers regardless 
        of what rank they hold in other circles.

        THE WORD OF A WITCH NEED NO BOND OR CONTRACT.  IT IS NECESSARILY 
        TRUE AND FREE OF EQUIVOCATION.

        We make it clear to all around us that we do not tolerate lieing.  
        If it is on the part of a friend or an acquaintance, we will 
        cease contact with them, if necessary.  If it is a member of the 
        craft, we do not willingly stand in the same circle with them.  
        If they are a student, this is one of the few areas that we will 
        invoke banishment as a punishment (or, if there are extenuating 
        circumstances and the person is of extreme value to the coven and 
        the Craft, we will consider corporal punishment or an equivalent 
        alternative proposed by the student to balance the wrong done to 
        the Coven, in lieu of banishment).  If they are an Initiate, it 
        is necessarily more harmful to the family, and therefore, more 
        serious. 

        PERFECT LOVE AND PERFECT TRUST (my fingers wanted to type love is 
        the law)

        Perfect love and perfect trust are not words spoken in blind 
        faith. They do not mean a blanket trust.  Perfect love and 
        perfect trust are what was in the hearts of the few, and most 
        dear, that when they heard rumors, first came to us and said 
        "what are these rumors about...".  These people knew that as 
        falible as we are, these rumors were not a reflection of our 
        will.  These people sought to know what happened, not to satisfy 
        any of their own devices or to judge us, but to share our pain 
        and the load.  These people are of different traditions and 
        levels of worldly Craft learning, but these people will always 
        hold a place in my heart second only to my brothers and sisters 
        that are literally of the My Family.

        THERE ARE THREE KINDS OF SECRETS IN THE WICCA CIRCLE AND ALL ARE 
        INVIOLATE EXCEPT IN AN ELDER CIRCLE, AND THEN ONLY TO THE EXTENT 
        THAT THEY ARE RELATIVE TO CRAFT BUSINESS AND HELD IN THAT ELDER 
        CIRCLE.

        1.   Secrets that are within the Circles that are private 
             to the members of that coven.
         
             (ie: when Charlie has a few drinks he.....
         
        2.   The secret held by the High Priestess and High Priest of 
             the inside and outside Circle affairs of the coven members, 
             due to their office.

        3.   The social and magick practices of the Craft that cannot be
             talked of outside of the Wicca without being taken out of 
             context and sensationalized.

        THERE ARE AS MANY WAYS TO LOVE THE GODDESS AS SHE HAS NAMES. 
         
        All ways of loving the Goddess are correct.  None are Wrong as 
        long as they are based in love.

        Say not "they are wrong" say "they are a different path from 
        mine".

        Until you know in your heart that you have found your path, do 
        not deny any wicca path that you have not walked.  
         
        When you find your path, still walk other paths with your 
        brothers and sisters in joy and love.

        "THE WICCA SHALL BE NAKED IN THERE RITE"

        All mankind is naked before God and Goddess.

        NO STRANGER NOT BORN IN THE FAMILY SHALL LEAD THE FAMILY OR A 
        TOTEM OF THE FAMILY.

        NO ONE WHO RALLIES AGAINST HIS FAMILY OR TRIBE SHALL BE KEPT IN 
        BANISHMENT PAST 14 YEARS AFTER THE EVENT, IF THAT UNDO THE HARM 
        CAUSED.

        NO ONE WHO EXTENDED THEMSELVES IN THE SUPPORT OF THEIR FAMILY OR 
        TRIBE SHALL BE BANISHED FOR OLD AGE OR THE ACTIONS OF INFIRMITY.

        IT IS NECESSARY THAT SKRYING, VISIONS, ASPECTING AND ALL OTHER 
        APPARENT VISIONS OF OUR LORD AND LADY BE QUESTIONED.  IT IS 
        ESSENTIAL TO OUR REBIRTH THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT OUR OWN 
        WISHFUL THINKING OR PRIDE, IF THERE BE THE LEAST DOUBT, THE 
        VISION MUST BE DENIED.  

        If a true vision is denied by the initiated, the Lady will 
        underline the truth in the vision in an unquestionable form.  If 
        this underlining comes as a punishment, it is still a small price 
        to pay when compared to the consequences of a false vision.

        IF EVER ANY OF THE TRIBE NEED A HOUSE OR LAND AND NONE WILL SELL, 
        THEN CRAFT MAY BE USED TO INCLINE THE OWNERS TO SELL, PROVIDED IT 
        HARMETH HIM NOT, AND THE FULL PRICE IS PAID WITHOUT HAGGLING.

        NEVER BARGAIN OR CHEAPEN ANYTHING YOU BUY BY THE ART.

        NO MAN, WOMAN, HIGH PRIESTESS, OR HIGH PRIEST CAN SAY WHAT "HARMS 
        NONE".

        The answer to this is for the Gods, not man.  A just action may 
        well harm someone in some way in the mundane world (every action 
        has an equal and opposite reaction).  It is always best to give 
        the action and the power to the Goddess, and abide by her will.  
        If it cannot be given to her after due consideration, then one 
        must act in the most just form that is possible, freely taking on 
        to our selves all adverse reaction of an error in judgment.

        NO ONE MAY DO ANYTHING WHICH WILL ENDANGER ANY OF THE TRIBE OR 
        BRING THEM INTO CONTACT WITH THE LAW OF THE LAND.

        THE ART MAY ONLY BE USED IN ERNEST AND NEVER FOR SHOW OR VAIN 
        GLORY.

        NO PERSON MAY BE WARNED OF HIS FATE MORE THAN THREE TIMES.

        MAIDEN: (Youngsters still new to the Craft, or older ones who do 
        ritual work and do not mind publicity.) Young people oriented to 
        cope with, and the ability to handle publicity.  Some knowledge 
        of occult and the Craft both in its practical and religious 
        aspects is necessary.  Childless women, virgins;  Warm friendly 
        people with good powers of projection.

        NYMPHS - (Do the bulk of ritual work, young adults.) Creative 
        people, artists, dancers, singers, etc.  Very mature, rational 
        and responsible.  Intuitive and uninhibited.  Knowledge of Craft 
        and occultism, etc. necessary.  Dislikes publicity.

        CRONES: (executive branch - teachers of neophytes, makes judg- 
        ments, etc.) Must be sober and serious, but with a sense of 
        humor, very mature in most all ways, intuitive of the true nature 
        and inner working of things. Older folks, intellectual, Masters 
        of there Craft, and dislike publicity.

        No woman shall be a Maiden who has not been in her courses.

        No woman shall be ordained unless she has passed her 17th year, 
        nor shall she have her ordination recognized until that time.

        No woman shall have her ordination recognized unless she is in 
        her courses, has ten fingers, ten toes, two eyes, two ears, a 
        nose.  Her generative organs and breasts must be complete.  The 
        honorable loss of limbs or the effects of torture following 
        ordination shall not invalidate the ordination.

        No woman shall be a Nymph who has not coupled.

        No man shall be a Magician who has not healed.

        In their youth, let those who cannot swing the axe till the 
        field.  Those who cannot till the field carry water.  Those who 
        cannot carry water, nor till the field, nor chase, nor battle, 
        nor be of service to their family or tribe, let them leave it.

        None shall be kept as a child forever.  Better that they be 
        banished if they cannot grow in mind.

        INITIATION

        NO PERSON MAY BE CALLED TO INITIATION MORE THAN THREE TIMES.

        NO PERSON MAY BE INITIATED WHO HAS LESS THAN 20 YEARS OF LIFE 
        LEFT TO THEM AT THE TIME OF INITIATION.

        No High Priestess or High Priest of the WICCA can cause an 
        initiation to take place.  Initiation is in the hands of the Lord 
        and Lady.  The teacher can only provide the environment that will 
        aide in the initiation if the God and Goddess so will it.

        If one questions the validity of their own initiation, there can 
        be but one answer, the initiation did not take place.  An 
        initiation by the Gods will be remembered.

        Let your judgment on matters which you make be fit to the size of 
        the case, not to your feelings.  Let your heart not rule your 
        mind, nor mind your heart, but bear a balance as has been taught 
        you.

        Not all are chosen for the tribe, nor are all in the tribe of one 
        family, nor are all in the family to be initiated, nor are all 
        the initiated to be ordained.  Your yoke is to be as strong as 
        you can bear, but no stronger.
