                           Ordo Sinistra Vivendi

                   (formerly Order of the Left Hand Path)



                              An Introduction



THE SINISTER WAY



        The OSV is an esoteric warrior Order embracing both the Left Hand

and Right Hand paths within the context of what it terms The Sinister Way.

        Because Westerners have been dualised by Judaeo-Christianity, they

incorrectly see the LH and RH paths as representing "evil" and "good"

respectively. The original meanings of the two paths however are:

        LHP: Anima/Yin, feminine principle of the universe, intuitive,

receptive, dark.

        RHP: Animus/Yang, male, logic, active, light principle.

        Rather than moral dualities, they reflect how nature operates via

interacting polarities. When an individual or a culture incorporate both

polarities as a totality, there is balance.





SATAN

        The sinister Way recognises the need to restore balance through

opposition (heresy); to create through destruction.

        The best-known archetype of opposition to stasis is Satan, from

Hebrew "adversary and accuser". This is the entropic force which energises

the universe, functioning in a state of perpetual flux - chaotically,

rather than in an orderly & predictable manner.





SINISTRA VIVENDI - THE SINISTER WAY

        Sinister from Latin translates as "on the left", signifying that

which goes against the norm. The OSV uses the term to signify the

universe's entropic force.





SYMBOL

        The goat and pentagram symbol of the OSV as shown on the cover,

symbolises the carnality of man: man as animal, rather than as separated

from nature which the spiritual dogmas believe. The goat is an

individualist rather than herd-like. Even Christianity recognises the

symbolism, with man separated into "goats" on the left, & Christian sheep

on the right. It's also Pan, the half-man, half-animal god. The self-

devouring world serpent is a universal archetype symbolising the entropic

force: creation - destruction - renewal.





MAN AS ANIMAL

        Anti-nature dogmas such as Christianity state that man is separate

from nature. Satanism holds that man is part of nature, an animal whose

behaviour is genetically based. This  the modern sciences of genetics and

sociobiology verify. The instinct is still the dominating force for human

and all other animal behaviour. Therefore, the individual cannot be more

than what he is genetically-endowed with; although he can be less than his

genetic potential if repressed by influences which aren't in accord with

his true nature (Will).

        Satanism unfolds the real nature of the individual; what the Greeks

called physis.





SATANIC ETHOS

        The Satanist frees himself from the bondage of dogma; he unfolds

that which he is. But he is the antithesis of the self-destructive nihilist

the pseudo- satanists proclaim themselves to be. What animal consumes drugs

and alcohol to the point of illness or death? What animal deliberately

weakens itself? Only man does this, with his so-called 'higher

consciousness' seeking to over-ride his animal instinct.

        What is evil? That which weakens. What is good? That which

strengthens, the individual, to paraphrase the Satanic philosopher

Nietzsche.





FAUSTIAN SOUL

        The Satanic 'soul' can be described as 'Faustian'. We stand for

wisdom undefiled and unfettered by any dogma. Our desire for knowledge, and

to see the scope of human thought extended unto infinity, is insatiable. We

desire to see humanity play amongst the stars.

        Professor R.S. Knox's description of the Faustian soul in his

introduction to the 1924 edition of Marlowe's Doctor Faustus states: "The

Faustus legend becomes for us a symbol of humanity's splendid struggle to

reach for the stars, the tragedy of infinite aspiration."
