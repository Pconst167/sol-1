                 SATANIC, OCCULT RITUALISTIC CRIME:
                    A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE

                            INTRODUCTION


The belief  that there is a  connection between satanism and  crime is
certainly  not  new.  In  fact,  one  of  the  older theories of crime
causation is demonology. Concern about  satanic or occult activity has
peaked from time to time throughout history. Concern in the late 1970s
focused primarily on "unexplained"  deaths and mutilations of animals,
and in recent years has focused  on child sexual abuse and the alleged
human sacrifice of missing children. In 1999 it will probably focus on
the impending "end of the world."

Today,  satanism  and   a  wide  variety  of  other   terms  are  used
interchangeably in  reference to certain crimes.  This discussion will
analyze the  nature of "satanic, occult,  ritualistic" crime and focus
on appropriate LAW ENFORCEMENT responses to it.

Recently  a flood  of law  enforcement seminars  and conferences  have
dealt with  satanic and ritualistic crime.  These training conferences
have  various  titles,  such  as  "Occult  in Crime," "Satanic Cults,"
"Ritualistic Crime Seminar," "Satanic Influences in Homicide," "Occult
Crimes,  Satanism  and  Teen   Suicide,"  and  "Ritualistic  Abuse  of
Children."

The typical  conference runs from one  to three days and  many of them
include the same presenters and  instructors. A wide variety of topics
are  usually  discussed  during  this  training  either  as individual
presentations by  different instructors or grouped  together by one or
more instructors. Typical topics covered include the following:

        1. Historical  overview of satanism,  witchcraft, and paganism
        from ancient to modern times.

        2. Nature and influence of fantasy role-playing games, such as
        Dungeons and Dragons.

        3. Lyrics,  symbolism, and influence  of rock and  roll, Heavy
        Metal, and Black Metal music.

        4. Teenage "stoner" gangs, their symbols, and their vandalism.

        5. Teenage suicide by adolescents dabbling in the occult.

        6.  Crimes  committed  by  self-styled  satanic practitioners,
        including grave and church  desecrations and robberies, animal
        mutilations, and even murders.

        7. Ritualistic abuse of children as part of bizarre ceremonies
        and human sacrifices.

        8. Organized, Traditional, or Multigenerational satanic groups
        involved in  organized conspiracies, such  as taking over  day
        care centers, infiltrating police departments, and trafficking
        in human sacrifice victims.

        9. The  "Big Conspiracy" theory, which  implies that satanists
        are responsible  for such things  as Adolph Hitler,  World War
        II, abortion,  pornography, Watergate, and  Irangate, and have
        infiltrated the  Department of Justice, the  Pentagon, and the
        White House.

During the  conferences, these nine areas  are linked together through
the  liberal use  of the   word "satanism"  and some  common symbolism
(pentagrams, 666, demons, etc.). The implication often is that all are
part  of a  continuum of  behavior, a  single problem  or some  common
conspiracy. The  information presented is  a mixture of  fact, theory,
opinion, fantasy, and  paranoia, and because some of  it can be proven
or  corroborated  (desecration  of  cemeteries,  vandalism, etc.), the
implication is  that it is  all true and  documented. The distinctions
among the different areas are blurred even if occasionally a presenter
tries to  make them. This is  complicated by the fact  that almost any
discussion of satanism  and witchcraft is interpreted in  the light of
the religious beliefs  of those in the audience.  Faith, not logic and
reason,  governs the  religious beliefs  of most  people. As a result,
some   normally  skeptical   law  enforcement   officers  accept   the
information  disseminated  at  these  conferences  without  critically
evaluating  it  or  questioning  the  sources.  Nothing  said  at such
conferences will  change the religious beliefs  of the attendees. Such
conferences  illustrate  the  ambiguity  and  wide  variety  of  terms
involved in this issue.



                             DEFINITIONS

The  words  satanic,  occult,  and  ritualistic  crime  are often used
interchangeably. It is difficult to  precisely define Satanism (with a
capital S), and no attempt will be  made to do so here. However, it is
important to realize how the word satanism (with a small s) is used by
many people.  Simply put, for  some people, satanism  is any religious
belief system other than their own. The Ayatollah Khomeini referred to
the United States  as the "Great Satan." In  the British Parliament, a
Protestant leader  called the Pope  the anti-Christ. In  a book titled
Prepare  For  War,  the  author,  Rebecca  Brown,  M.D., has a chapter
entitled "Is Roman Catholicism Witchcraft?" Dr. Brown also lists among
the  "doorways"   to  satanic  power  and/or   demon  infestation  the
following:    fortune   tellers,    horoscopes,   fraternity    oaths,
vegetarianism,  yoga,  self-hypnosis,  relaxation  tapes, acupuncture,
biofeedback,  fantasy  role-playing  games,  adultery,  homosexuality,
pornography, judo, karate, and rock  music. Dr. Brown states that rock
music  "was a  carefully masterminded  plan by  none other  than Satan
himself." The ideas  in this book may seem  extreme and even humorous.
This book, however, has been recommended as a serious reference in law
enforcement training material on this topic.

In books,  lectures, handout material,  and conversations, the  author
has heard all of the following referred to as satanism:

Church of Satan         Stoner Gangs            New Age
Ordo Templi Orientis    Heavy Metal Music       Astrology
Temple of Set           Rock Music              Channeling
Demonology              KKK                     Transcendental Meditation
Witchcraft              Nazis                   Holistic Medicine
Paganism                Scientology             Buddhism
Santeria                Unification Church      Hinduism
Voodoo                  The Way                 Mormonism
Rosicrucians            Hare Krishna            Islam
Freemasonry             Rajneesh                Orthodox Church
Knights Templar         Religious Cults         Roman Catholicism

At  law   enforcement  training  conferences,   witchcraft,  santeria,
paganism,  and  the  occult  are  frequently  referred  to as forms of
satanism. It may  be a matter of definition, but  these things are not
necessarily  the same  as traditional  Satanism. The  worship of lunar
goddesses  and nature  and the  practice of  fertility rituals  is not
satanism. Santeria is a combination  of 17th century Roman Catholicism
and African paganism.

Occult means simply "hidden." All  unreported or unsolved crimes might
be  regarded as  occult, but  in this  context the  term refers to the
action or  influence of supernatural powers,  some secret knowledge of
them, or  an interest in  paranormal phenomena. Occult  does not imply
satanism,  evil,  wrongdoing,  or   crime.  Indeed,  historically  the
principal crimes deserving of consideration as "occult crimes" are the
frauds  perpetrated by  fortune tellers  and "psychics"  who for a fee
arrange visitations  with dead loved  ones and commit  other financial
crimes against the gullible.

Many individuals define satanism from a totally Christian perspective,
using this word to describe the power  of evil in the world. With this
definition,  any  crimes,  especially  those  which  are  particularly
bizarre, repulsive, or cruel, can be viewed as satanic in nature. Yet,
it  is just  a difficult  to  precisely  define satanism  as it  is to
precisely  define  Christianity  or   any  complete  spiritual  belief
system.

What is Ritualistic Crime?

The biggest  confusion, however, is over  the word ritualistic. During
law enforcement training conferences on this topic, ritualistic almost
always comes to  mean satanic or at least  spiritual. Ritual can refer
to a prescribed religious ceremony,  but in its broader meaning refers
to any customarily repeated act or  series of acts. The need to repeat
these  acts  can  be  cultural,  sexual,  or  psychological as well as
spiritual.

Cultural rituals  could include such things  as what a family  eats on
Thanksgiving Day or when and how presents are opened at Christmas. The
initiation  ceremonies of  fraternities, sororities,  gangs, and other
social clubs are other examples of cultural rituals.

Since 1972, the  author has lectured about sexual  ritualism, which is
nothing more than repeatedly engaging in an act or series of acts in a
certain manner  because of a sexual  need. In order to  become aroused
and/or gratifies,  a person must engage  in the act in  a certain way.
This  sexual  ritualism  can  include  such  things  as  the  physical
characteristics, age, or gender of the victim, the particular sequence
of acts,  the bringing or taking  of specific objects, and  the use of
certain  words or  phrases. This  is  more  than the  concept of  M.O.
(Method of Operation) known to most police officers. M.O. is something
done by an offender because it  works. Sexual ritual is something done
by an offender because of a  need. Deviant acts, such as urinating on,
defecating on, or  even eviscerating a victim, are  far more likely to
be  the  result  of  sexual  ritualism  than  religious  or  "satanic"
ritualism.

From  a  criminal  investigative   perspective,  two  other  forms  of
ritualism must be recognized. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental  Disorders  (DSM-III-R)  defines  Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
(OCD) as  "repetitive, purposeful, and intentional  behaviors that are
performed in response  to an obsession, or according  to certain rules
or  in a  stereotyped  fashion."  Such compulsive  behavior frequently
involves rituals. Although such  behavior usually involves noncriminal
activity  such as  excessive hand  washing or  checking that doors are
locked,  occasionally compulsive  ritualism  can  be part  of criminal
activity. Certain gamblers or firesetters, for example, are thought by
some  authorities to  be motivated  in part  through such compulsions.
Ritual can  also stem from  psychotic hallucinations and  delusions. A
crime can  be committed in a  precise manner because a  voice told the
offender to do it that way or because a divine mission required it.

To  make  this  more   confusing,  cultural,  religious,  sexual,  and
psychological  ritualism  can  overlap.   Some  psychotic  people  are
preoccupied  with religious  delusions and  hear the  voice of  God or
Satan telling them  to do things of a  religious nature. Offenders who
feel  little,  if   any,  guilt  over  the  crimes   may  need  little
justification for their antisocial behavior. As human beings, however,
they may have fears, concerns and anxiety over getting away with their
criminal acts.  It is difficult  to pray to  God for success  in doing
things that are against His  Commandments. A negative spiritual belief
system may fulfill their human need  for assistance from and belief in
a greater  power  or  to  deal  with  their  superstitions. Compulsive
ritualism  (e.g., excessive  cleanliness or  fear of  disease) can  be
introduced into sexual behavior. Even many "normal" people have a need
for  order and  predictability and  therefore may  engage in family or
work rituals. Under stress or in  times of change, this need for order
and ritual may increase.

Ritualistic  crime may  fulfill  the  cultural, spiritual,  sexual and
psychological  needs of  an  offender.  Crimes may  be ritualistically
motivated or  may have ritualistic  elements. The ritual  behavior may
also fulfill  basic criminal needs  to manipulate victims,  get rid of
rivals, send a message to enemies, and intimidate co-conspirators. The
leaders of a group may want to play upon the beliefs and superstitions
of those around them and try  to convince accomplices and enemies that
they, the leaders, have special or "supernatural" powers.

The important point  for the criminal investigator is  to realize that
most ritualistic criminal behavior is  not motivated simply by satanic
or  religious   ceremonies.  At  some   conferences,  presenters  have
attempted  to  make  na  issue  of  distinguishing  between  "ritual,"
"ritualized,"  and  "ritualistic"  abuse  of  children.  these  subtle
distinctions,  however, seem  to be   of no  significant value  to the
criminal investigator.


What Is Ritualistic Abuse of Children?

It is not  an easy question to answer. Most  people today use the term
to  refer to  abuse of  children that  is part  of some evil spiritual
belief system, which almost by definition must be satanic.

Dr. Lawrence Pazder, author  of Michelle Remembers, defines ritualized
abuse  of  children  as  "repeated  physical,  emotional,  mental, and
spiritual  assaults  combined  with  a  systematic  use of symbols and
secret  ceremonies designed  to turn  a child  against itself, family,
society,  and  God."  He  also  states  that  :the  sexual assault has
ritualistic meaning and is not for sexual gratification."

This  definition  may  have  value  for  academics,  sociologists, and
therapists,  but it  creates potential  problems for  law enforcement.
Certain acts  engaged in with  children (kissing, touching,  appearing
naked, etc.) may be criminal if performed for sexual gratification. If
the   ritualistic  acts   were   in   fact  performed   for  spiritual
indoctrination, potential prosecution can be jeopardized, particularly
if the  acts can be  defended as constitutionally  protected religious
expression. The  mutilation of a  baby's genitals for  sadistic sexual
pleasure  is  a  crime.  The  circumcision  of  a  baby's genitals for
religious reasons is  most likely NOT a crime. The  intent of the acts
is important for criminal prosecution.

The author has  been unable to precisely define  ritualistic abuse and
prefers  not  to  use  the  term.  It  is  confusing,  misleading, and
counterproductive.  Certain observations,  however, are  important for
investigative understanding.

Not  all  spiritually  motivated   ritualistic  activity  is  satanic.
Santeria,  witchcraft,  voodoo,  and  most  religious  cults  are  not
satanism.  In fact,  most spiritually-  or religiously-based  abuse of
children has nothing to do with  satanism. Most child abuse that could
be  termed ritualistic  by various  definitions is  more likely  to be
physical  and  psychological  rather  than  sexual  in  nature.  If  a
distinction  needs to  be made  between satanic  and nonsatanic  child
abuse, the indicators for that distinction must be related to specific
satanic symbols, artifacts, or doctrine  rather than the mere presence
of any ritualistic element.

Not all  such ritualistic activity  is satanic. Santeria,  witchcraft,
voodoo,  and most  religious cults   are not  satanism. In  fact, most
spiritually or  religiously-based abuse of children  has nothing to do
with satanism.  Most child abuse  that could be  termed ritualistic by
various definitions  is more likely  to be physical  and psychological
rather  than sexual  in nature.  If  a  distinction needs  to be  made
between satanic  and nonsatanic child  abuse, the indicators  for that
distinction must be related to specific satanic symbols, artifacts, or
doctrine rather than the mere presence of any ritualistic element.

Not all such ritualistic activity with  a child is a crime. Almost all
parents with  religious beliefs indoctrinate their  children into that
belief system. Is circumcision for religious reasons child abuse? Does
having a  child kneel on a  hard floor reciting the  rosary constitute
child abuse?  Does having a child  chant a satanic prayer  or attend a
black mass constitute child abuse? Does a religious belief in corporal
punishment constitute  child abuse? Does  group care of  children in a
commune or cult constitute child abuse? Does the fact that any acts in
question were performed with parental  permission affect the nature of
the crime? Many  ritualistic acts, whether satanic or  not, are simply
not crimes.

When  a victim  describes and  investigation corroborates  what sounds
like ritualistic  activity, several possibilities  must be considered.
The ritualistic activity may be a part of the excessive religiosity of
a mentally ill, psychotic offender. It  may be a misunderstood part of
sexual ritualism.  The ritualistic activity  may be incidental  to any
real abuse. The offender may  be involved in ritualistic activity with
a child and  also may be abusing  a child, but one  may have little or
nothing to do with the other.

The offender may be deliberately engaging in ritualistic activity with
a child as part of child abuse. The motivation, however, may be not to
indoctrinate  the  child  into  a  belief  system,  but  to  lower the
inhibitions  of,  to  control  and  manipulate,  and/or to confuse the
child.  In  all  the  turmoil  over  this  issue,  it  would be a very
effective strategy  for any child  molester to deliberately  introduce
ritualistic elements to  his crime to confuse the  child and therefore
the criminal  justice system. The  ritualistic activity and  the child
abuse may be  integral parts of some spiritual  belief system. In that
case, the greatest  risk is to the children  of the practitioners. But
this is true of all cults, not just satanic cults. A high potential of
abuse  exists for  any children  raised in  a group  isolated from the
mainstream  of  society,  especially  if  the  group has a charismatic
leader  whose  orders  are  unquestioned  and  blindly  obeyed  by the
members. Sex, money, and power are  most often the main motivations of
the leaders of such cults.

What Makes a Crime Satanic, Occult, or Ritualistic?

Some  would  argue  that  it  is  the  offender's spiritual beliefs or
membership in  a cult or  "church." If that  is the criteria,  why not
label the crimes committed by  Protestants, Catholics, and Jews in the
same  way?  Are  the  atrocities  of  Jim  Jones, in Guyana, Christian
crimes?

Some would  answer that it is  the presence of certain  symbols in the
possession or home of the perpetrator.  What does it mean then to find
a crucifix, Bible, rosary,  etc., in the possession or  home of a bank
robber, embezzler, child molester, or murderer? If different criminals
possess  the  same  symbols,  are  they  necessarily  part  of one big
conspiracy?

Others would answer that it is the presence of certain symbols such as
pentagrams, inverted crosses, and 666 at the crime scene. What does it
mean then to  find a cross spray-painted on a  wall or carved into the
body of a victim? What does it mean for a perpetrator to leave a Bible
tied to his murder victim? What about the possibility that an offender
deliberately left such symbols to make it look like a "satanic" crime?

Some would argue that it is the bizarreness or cruelness of the crime:
body mutilation,  amputation, drinking of blood,  eating of flesh, use
or urine  or feces. Does  this mean that  all individuals involved  in
lust   murder,   sadism,   vampirism,   cannibalism,   urophilia,  and
coprophilia are satanists or occult  practitioners? What does this say
about  the bizarre  crimes of  psychotic killers  such as  Ed Gein  or
Richard Trenton Chase, both of whom mutilated their victims as part of
their psychotic delusions?

A few  might  even  answer  that  it  is  the  fact that the crime was
committed on  a date with  satanic or occult  significance (Halloween,
May Eve, etc.) or the fact that the perpetrator claims that Satan told
him to commit  the crime. what does this mean  for crimes committed on
Thanksgiving or  Christmas? What does this  say about crimes committed
by perpetrators  who claim that God  or Jesus told them  to do it? One
note of  interest is the fact  that in handout and  reference material
collected by  the author, the number  of dates with satanic  or occult
significance ranges from 8 to 110. This is compounded by the fact that
it is sometimes stated that  satanists can celebrate these holidays on
several days on either side of the official date or that the birthdays
of practitioners can also be holidays. The exact names and exact dates
of  the holidays  and the  meaning  of  symbols listed  may also  vary
depending on who prepared the  material. The handout material is often
distributed without identifying the author or documenting the original
source  of  the  information.  It  is  then  frequently photocopied by
attendees and  passed on to other  police officers with no  one really
knowing its validity or origin.

Most, however, would probably answer  that what makes a crime satanic,
occult, or ritualistic is the motivation  for the crime. It is a crime
that is spiritually  motivated by a religious belief  system. How then
do we label the following true crimes?

        a. Parents  defy a court order  and send their children  to an
        unlicensed Christian school.

        b. Parents refuse to send their children to any school because
        they are waiting for the second coming of Christ.

        c. Parents  beat their child to  death because he or  she will
        not follow their Christian beliefs.

        d. Parents  violate child labor laws  because they believe the
        Bible requires such work.

        e. Individuals  bomb an abortion  clinic or kidnap  the doctor
        because their religious belief system says abortion is murder.

        f. A child molester reads the Bible to his victims in order to
        justify his sex acts with them.

        g. Parents  refuse life-saving medical  treatment for a  child
        because of their religious beliefs.

        h. Parents starve and beat  their child to death because their
        minister said the child was possessed by demonic spirits.

Some people  would argue that  the Christians who  committed the above
crimes misunderstood and distorted  their religion while satanists who
commit crimes are following theirs. But who decides what constitutes a
misinterpretation of  a religious belief  system? The individuals  who
committed the above-described crimes, however misguided, believed that
they were following their religion as they understood it. Religion was
and  is used  to justify  such social  behavior as  the Crusades,  the
Inquisition, Apartheid, segregation, and violence in Northern Ireland,
India, and Lebanon.

Who  decides exactly  what "satanists"  believe? In  this country,  we
cannot even agree on what  Christians believe. At many law enforcement
conferences  The Satanic  Bible is  used  for  this, and  it is  often
contrasted or compared with the Christian Bible. The Satanic Bible is,
in essence, a  150-page paperback book written by one  man in 1969. To
compare  it to  a book  written by  over 30  authors over  a period of
thousands  of years  is ridiculous,  even ignoring  the possibility of
Divine  revelation  in  the  Christian  Bible.  What satanists believe
certainly  isn't limited  to other  peoples' interpretation  of a  few
books.   More  importantly,   it  is   subject  to   some  degree   of
interpretation by individual believers just as Christianity is.

The fact is that far more crime  and child abuse has been committed by
zealots in  the name of  God, Jesus, and  Mohammed than has  ever been
committed in the name of Satan. Many people don't like that statement,
but few can argue with it.

Although  defining a  crime as  satanic, occult,  or ritualistic would
probably involve  a combination of  the criteria set  forth above, the
author has been unable to clearly  define such a crime. Each potential
definition presents a different set  of problems when measured against
an objective, rational, and  constitutional perspective. Each offender
in a group  may have a different motivation for  the crime. The author
has discovered that the facts  of so-called "satanic crimes" are often
significantly  different from  what  is  described at  law enforcement
training  conferences  or  in  the  media.  The  actual involvement of
satanism  or  the  occult  in  these  cases  usually  turns  out to be
secondary, insignificant, or nonexistent.


                   THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE

The  perspective   with  which  one  looks   at  satanic,  occult,  or
ritualistic  crime is  extremely important.  Sociologists, therapists,
religious leaders,  parents, and just  plain citizens each  have their
own  valid  concerns  and  views  about  this  issue. This discussion,
however, will deal ONLY with the law enforcement perspective.

The  law  enforcement  perspective  must  focus  on  crime and clearly
recognize  that  just  because  an  activity  is  "satanic"  does  not
necessarily  mean  it  is  a  crime  or  that  it  is not a legitimate
religious  practice  protected  by  the  First  Amendment.  Within the
personal  religious  belief  system  of  a  law  enforcement  officer,
Christianity may  be good and  satanism evil. Under  the Constitution,
however, both are neutral.

This is an important, but  difficult, concept for many law enforcement
officers  to accept.  They are   paid to  uphold the  Constitution and
enforce  the  penal  code,  not  the  Ten  Commandments.  The apparent
increasing numbers  of teenagers and some  adults dabbling in satanism
and the occult may be cause for concern for parents, school officials,
and society. What, however, law enforcement  can or should do about it
is  another   matter.  Police  interference  with   free  exercise  of
constitutional   rights   potentially   creates   major  problems  and
conflicts.

What  is  the  justification   for  law  enforcement  officers  giving
presentations on satanism and the  occult to citizen groups, PTA's, or
school assemblies? Is it public  relations, a safety program, or crime
prevention? If it is crime prevention, how much crime can be linked to
satanic  or  occult  activity  and  what  do  such presentations do to
prevent the crime? Law  enforcement agencies should carefully consider
the legal  implications and justification  for such presentations.  Is
the fact that satanism or the occult is or can be a negative influence
on some people enough justification for such law enforcement efforts?

When  you combine  an emotional  issue  such  as the  sexual abuse  of
children with an even more  emotional issue such as people's religious
beliefs, it is difficult to  maintain objectivity and remember the law
enforcement perspective.  Some police officers may  even feel that all
crime is caused  by evil, all evil is caused  by Satan, and therefore,
all crime is satanic crime. This may be a valid religious perspective,
but it is  of no relevance to the investigation  of crime for purposes
of prosecution.

Many of the police officers who  lecture on satanic or occult crime do
not  even  investigate  such  cases.  Their  presentations  are more a
reflection  of  their  personal   religious  beliefs  than  documented
investigative  information.  They  are  absolutely  entitled  to their
beliefs,  but  introducing  themselves  as  current  or  former police
officers and then speaking as religious advocates causes confusion. As
difficult as it might be,  police officers must separate the religious
and  law   enforcement  perspectives  when   they  are  lecturing   or
investigating  in   their  official  capacities   as  law  enforcement
officers. Many  law enforcement officers begin  their presentations by
stating  that they  are not  addressing or  judging anyone's religious
beliefs, and then proceed to do exactly that.

Some police officers have resigned  rather than curtail or limit their
involvement  in this  issue as  ordered by  their departments. Perhaps
such officers deserve credit for recognizing that they could no longer
keep the perspectives separate.

Law  enforcement  officers  who  believe  that  the  investigation  of
satanic/occult crime puts them in conflict with supernatural forces of
evil should probably not be assigned to these cases. If, however, such
officers must  be or are assigned,  they will need the  power of their
own spiritual belief system in order to deal with the superstition and
religious  implications  of  these  cases.  the  religious  beliefs of
officers should  provide spiritual strength and  support for them, but
not affect the objectivity and professionalism of the investigation.

The law  enforcement perspective requires  avoiding the paranoia  that
has  crept  into  this  issue  and  into  some  of the law enforcement
training conferences. Paranoid belief systems are characterized by the
gradual development  of intricate, complex,  and elaborate systems  of
thinking    based   on    and   often    proceeding   logically   from
misinterpretation  of  actual   events.  Paranoia  typically  involves
hypervigilance over  the perceives threat,  the belief that  danger is
around every corner, and the willingness  to take up the challenge and
do something about it. Another  very important aspect of this paranoia
is the belief that those who do  not recognize the threat are evil and
corrupt. In  this extreme view,  you are either  with them or  against
them. You are either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Concern over satanic crime and ritualistic abuse of children is highly
polarizing. After one presentation on this topic, a student wrote in a
critique  that the  author was  obviously an  "agnostic cultist." Some
zealots even use the term "clean" to refer to law enforcement officers
who  have  not  been  infiltrated  by  the  satanists.  If some police
officers or military personnel practice satanism or paganism does that
mean that law enforcement and  the military have been infiltrated? The
word "infiltrated" is only used when talking about an unpopular belief
system. Protestants,  Catholics, and Jews  are no longer  though of as
"infiltrating"  the police  and military,  but not  long ago Jews were
thought by many to have done so.

Overzealousness and exaggeration motivated  by the religious fervor of
those  involved in  law enforcement  training is  more acceptable than
that motivated by ego or profit.  There are those who are deliberately
distorting and  hyping this issue  for personal notoriety  and profit.
Satanic and occult crime has  become a growth industry. Speaking fees,
books,  video and  audio  tapes,  prevention material,  television and
radio appearances all bring egoistic and financial rewards.

Law  enforcement officers  must be  objective fact  finders. It is not
their job to  believe children or other complainants.  It is their job
to listen.  The law enforcement  perspective can't ignore  the lack of
physical evidence (no bodies or even  hairs, fibers, or fluids left by
violent murders);  the difficulty in successfully  committing a large-
scale  conspiracy  crime  (the  more  people  involved  in  any  crime
conspiracy, the  harder it is to  get away with it);  and human nature
(intragroup conflicts resulting in individual self-serving disclosures
would be bound to occur in any group involved in organized kidnapping,
baby  breeding  and  human  sacrifice).   If  an  when  members  of  a
destructive  cult commit  murders, they  are bound  to make  mistakes,
leave evidence, and eventually make  admissions in order to brag about
their crimes or to reduce their  legal liability. The discovery of the
murders in  Matamoros, Mexico in  April, 1989 and  the results of  the
subsequent investigation are good examples of these dynamics.

Bizarre crime  and evil can occur  without organized satanic activity.
The law  enforcement perspective requires that  we distinguish between
what we know and what we're not sure of. The facts are:

        a. Some  individuals believe in  and are involved  in satanism
        and the occult.

        b. Some of these individuals commit crime.

        c.  Some  groups  of   individuals  share  these  beliefs  and
        involvement in satanism and the occult.

        d. Some members of these groups commit crime together.

The unanswered questions are:

        a. What  is the connection  between the belief  system and the
        crimes committed?

        b.  Is there  an organized  conspiracy of  satanic and  occult
        believers responsible  for inter-related serious  crime (e.g.,
        molestation, murder)?

After all the hype and hysteria  is put aside, the realization sets in
that  most  satanic/occult  activity  involves  the  commission  of NO
crimes,  and  that  which  does  usually  involves  the  commission of
relatively  minor crimes  such as  trespassing, vandalism,  cruelty to
animals, or  petty thievery. The  law enforcement problems  most often
linked to satanic or occult activity are:

        1. Vandalism
        2. Desecration of churches and cemeteries
        3. Thefts from churches and cemeteries
        4. Teenage gangs
        5. Animal mutilations
        6. Teenage suicide
        7. Child abuse
        8. Kidnapping
        9. Murder and human sacrifice

Valid evidence shows some "connection" between satanism and the occult
and the  first six problems set  forth above. The "connection"  to the
last three problems is far more uncertain.

Even  where  there  seems  to  be  a  "connection,"  the nature of the
connection needs  to be explored. It  is easy to blame  involvement in
satanism and the occult for behaviors that have complex motivations. A
teenager's excessive involvement in satanism and the occult is usually
a symptom  of  a  problem  and  not  the  cause  of a problem. Blaming
satanism for  a teenager's vandalism,  theft, suicide, or  even act of
murder is like blaming a criminal's  offenses on his tattoos: both are
often signs  of the same rebelliousness  and lack of self  esteem that
contribute to the commission of crimes.

The law  enforcement investigator must objectively  evaluate the legal
significance  of  any  criminal's  spiritual  beliefs.  In most cases,
including those involving  satanists, it will have little  or no legal
significance. If  a crime is committed  as part of a  spiritual belief
system, it  should make no difference  which belief system it  is. The
crime is the same  whether a child is abused or murdered  as part of a
Christian,  Hare  Krishna,  Moslem,  or  any  other  belief system. we
generally  don't  label  crimes  with  the  name  of the perpetrator's
religion.  Why  then  are  the  crimes  of  child  molesters, rapists,
sadists, and murderers  who happen to be involved  in satanism and the
occult  labeled  as  satanic  or  occult  crimes?  If  criminals use a
spiritual belief  system to rationalize  and justify or  to facilitate
and  enhance  their  criminal  activity,   should  the  focus  of  law
enforcement be on the belief system or on the criminal activity?

Several documented murders have been committed by individuals involved
in one  way or another  in satanism  or  the occult. In  some of these
murders, the  perpetrator has even  introduced elements of  the occult
(e.g., satanic  symbols at crime scene).  Does that automatically make
these satanic murders?  It is the author's opinion  that the answer is
no. Ritualistic murders committed by  serial killers or sexual sadists
are  not necessarily  satanic or  occult murders.  Ritualistic murders
committed by psychotic killers who hear the voice of satan are no more
satanic murders  than murders committed by  psychotic killers who hear
the voice of Jesus are Christian murders.

Rather, a  satanic murder can  be defined as  one committed by  two or
more  individuals  who  rationally  plan  the  crime and whose PRIMARY
motivation is to  fulfill a prescribed satanic ritual  calling for the
murder.  By this  definition, the  author has  been unable to identify
even one documented satanic murder in the United States. Although such
murders may  have and can occur,  they appear to be  few in number. In
addition,  the  commission  of  such  killings  would  probably be the
beginning of the end for such a group. It is highly unlikely that they
could continue  to kill several  people, every year,  year after year,
and not be discovered.

A brief  typology of  satanic and  occult practitioners  is helpful in
evaluating what  relationship, if any,  such practices have  to crimes
under  investigation.  The  following  typology  is  adapted  from the
investigative experience of Office Sandi  Gallant of the San Francisco
Police Department, who  began to study the criminal  aspects of occult
activity long  before it became  popular. No typology  is perfect, but
the  author  uses  this  typology  because  it  is  simple  and offers
investigative  insights. Most  practitioners  fall  into one  of three
categories, any of which can be practiced alone or in groups.

        1.  Youth  Subculture  -  Most  teenagers  involved in fantasy
        role-playing games,  heavy metal music, or  satanism are going
        through  a  stage  of  adolescent  development  and  commit no
        significant  crimes.  The  teenagers  who  have  more  serious
        problems  are  usually  those  from  dysfunctional families or
        those who have poor communication within their families. These
        troubled teenagers turn to satanism and the occult to overcome
        a sense  of alienation, to  obtain power, or  to justify their
        antisocial behavior. for these teenagers, it is the symbolism,
        not  the spirituality,  that is  important. It  is either  the
        psychopathic or the oddball, loner teenager who is most likely
        to get into serious trouble. Extreme involvement in the occult
        is a symptom of a problem, not the cause. This is not to deny,
        however, that satanism and  the occult are negative influences
        for a troubled teenager. But to hysterically warn teenagers to
        avoid this  "mysterious, powerful and  dangerous" thing called
        satanism  will   drive  many  teenagers  right   to  it.  Some
        rebellious  teenagers will  do  whatever  will most  shock and
        outrage society  in order to  flaunt their rejection  of adult
        norms.

        2. Dabblers (Self-styled) -  for these practitioners, there is
        little  or   no  spiritual  motivation.   They  mix  satanism,
        witchcraft and paganism. Symbols  mean whatever they want them
        to mean.  Molesters, rapists, drug  dealers and murderers  may
        dabble  in  the  occult  and  may  commit  their  crimes  in a
        ceremonial or ritualistic way. This category has the potential
        to be  the most dangerous,  and most of  the "satanic" killers
        fall into this category. Their involvement in satanism and the
        occult  is a  symptom of  a problem  and a rationalization and
        justification of antisocial behavior. Satanic/occult practices
        (as well  as those of  other spiritual belief  systems) can be
        used as a mechanism to facilitate criminal objectives.

        3. Traditional  (Orthodox, Multigenerational) -  These are the
        true believers. They are usually wary of outsiders. Because of
        this and constitutional issues,  such groups are difficult for
        law enforcement to penetrate. Although  there is much we don't
        know about these groups, as of  now there is little or no hard
        evidence that they are involved in serious, organized criminal
        activity.  In  addition,  instead  of  being self-perpetuating
        master  crime  conspirators,  true  believers  probably have a
        similar problem  with their teenagers  rebelling against their
        belief system.

Many police  officers ask what  to look for  during the search  of the
scene of  suspected satanic activity.  The answer is  simple: look for
evidence  of a  crime. A  pentagram is  no more criminally significant
than  a  crucifix  unless  it  corroborates  a  crime  or  a  criminal
conspiracy.  If  a  victim's  description   of  the  location  or  the
instruments  of the  crime includes  a pentagram,  then the  pentagram
would  be evidence.  But the  same would  be true  if the  description
included a crucifix.

There  is  no   way  any  one  law  enforcement   officer  can  become
knowledgeable  about all  the symbols  and rituals  of every spiritual
belief system that might become  part of a criminal investigation. the
officer  needs   only  to  be   trained  to  recognize   the  possible
investigative  significance  of  such  signs,  symbols,  and  rituals.
Knowledgeable religious scholars, academics, and other true experts in
the  community  can  be  consulted  if  a  more  detailed  analysis is
necessary. Any  analysis, however, may have  only limited application,
especially   to  cases   involving  teenagers,   dabblers,  and  other
self-styled practitioners.  The fact is,  signs, symbols, and  rituals
can mean anything that practitioners want them to mean and/or anything
that observers interpret them to mean. The meaning of symbols can also
change  over  time,  place,  and  circumstances.  Is  a swastika spray
painted on a wall an ancient  symbol of prosperity and good fortune, a
recent  symbol of  Naziism and  anti-Semitism, or  a current symbol of
paranoia and adolescent  defiance? The peace sign, which  in the 1960s
was a familiar antiwar symbol, is now supposed to be a satanic symbol.

In spite  of what is  sometimes said or  suggested at law  enforcement
training conferences, police have no authority to seize any satanic or
occult paraphernalia they  might see during a search.  A legally valid
reason must exist  for doing so. It is not  the job of law enforcement
to prevent  satanists from engaging in  noncriminal teaching, rituals,
or other activities.


                             CONCLUSIONS

There must be a middle ground  in this issue. Concern about satanic or
occult  activity  should  not  be  a  big  joke  limited  to religious
fanatics. On  the other hand, law  enforcement is not now  locked in a
life-and-death  struggle against  the supernatural  forces of  ancient
evil. Law  enforcement officers need to  know something about satanism
and  the   occult  in  order  to   properly  evaluate  their  possible
connections to  and motivations for criminal  activity. They must know
when  and  how  beliefs,  symbols,  and  paraphernalia  can be used to
corroborate criminal activity. From a community relations perspective,
they  must  also  learn  to  respect  spiritual  beliefs  that  may be
different or unpopular but that are  not illegal. The focus must be on
the objective investigation of violations of criminal statutes.

Until hare evidence is obtained  and corroborated, the American people
should not be frightened into believing that babies are being bred and
eaten,  that  50,000  missing  children  are  being  murdered in human
sacrifices,  or  that  satanists  are  taking  over America's day care
centers. No one  can prove with absolute certainty  that such activity
has NOT  occurred. The burden of  proof, however, as it  would be in a
criminal prosecution, is  on those who claim that  it has occurred. As
law enforcement agencies  evaluate and decide what they  can or should
do about satanic and occult  activity in their communities, they might
also  consider  how  to  deal  with  the  hype  and  hysteria  of  the
"anti-satanists." The overreaction to the problem can clearly be worse
than the  problem. An unjustified  crusade against those  perceived as
satanists  could result  in  wasted  resources, unwarranted  damage to
reputations, and disruption of civil liberties.

In general, the law enforcement  perspective can best be maintained by
investigators repeatedly  asking themselves what they  would do if the
acts  in  question  were  part  of  Protestant,  Catholic,  or  Jewish
activity.  If a  law enforcement  agency wants  to evaluate  the group
spiritual  framework within  which a  crime is  committed, it  is more
appropriate, accurate, and  objective to refer to such  crimes as cult
crimes  rather than  as satanic,  occult, or  ritualistic crimes.  The
"Sects, Cults and  Deviant Movements" seminar put on  by The Institute
of Police Technology and Management at the University of North Florida
in Jacksonville,  Florida, is a  good example of  this more objective,
broad-based  approach.  Satanic  cults  have  no  more law enforcement
significance than many other  potentially destructive cults that exist
in this country.
