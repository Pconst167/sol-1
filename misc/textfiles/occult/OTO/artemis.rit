O Thou Beautiful
     Lady of the Moon,
Virgin Artemis,
     Mysterious and Triune,
Who bearest a bow 
     And a quiver of splendour
With elegant arrows
     Made of glittering silver,
Sister of Apollo
     And daughter of Zeus,
Most Mysterious Woman,
     Mystick and Abstruse,
Who art Selene above
     Waxing in the sky,
And Hecate below
     Waning with a sigh,
And Artemis on earth
     Protecting child birth,
Thou Triple Goddess
     Of the Ageless Moon,
Lady of the Nocturnal
     And Mystick Swoon,
Virgin Artemis
     Of Lunar Delight,
Admirable Queen 
     Of the Starry Night,
Lover of youth
     And Guardian of Truth,
Holy Priestess
     And Virgin Huntress,
Mighty Protectress,
     Full Moon in Darkness,
Holy Virgin,
     Holy Guardian,
Blessed Goddess
     Of the Cypress Garden,
We invoke thy
     Lunar Ecstasy,
And we invoke thy
     Mystick Trance!
We invoke thy
     Magick Sovereignty,
And we invoke thy
     Secret Guidance!
Come, O come, Lady Artemis,
     Our beloved Moon,
And fill us with your Mystick
     And Wondrous Swoon!
We invoke thee to enrich
     Our souls with thy Mystick Power,
Come, O come, in this,
     Thine holy hour!
