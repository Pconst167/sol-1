   There is no doubt that this person has resorted to mouth breathing, which
has  aggravated  the throat trouble,  but by consistent continuance  of  the
treatment here outlined she will soon experience less difficulty in  breath-
ing  and  it  will then be an easy matter to learn to  breathe  through  the
proper channels, the nostrils.

   A  healer  having Leo on the Ascendant and whose Saturn is not  in  Virgo

NO.28.   ACCIDENTS TO HEAD, POOR OXYGENATION

   GOOD ASPECTS:  Saturn sextile Jupiter, trine Mars and Uranus.

   BAD ASPECTS:   Jupiter opposition Mars and Uranus; Moon opposition Venus;

   This is the horoscope of a man born on March 16, 1865, at 3 P.M.,  in En-
gland,  and it affords a good example of how accidents are also  crises  are
shown  in the horoscope.   The main affliction comes from the fact that  the
Sun  and Mercury are in close conjunction in the Eighth House,  occupied  by
Pisces.   This  itself is unfortunate for the reasoning faculty.   They  are
both  square  to Jupiter in Sagittarius, which also has a  strong  influence
upon the mind.  But worst of all, they are square to Mars, the planet of dy-
namic  energy,  impulse,  etc.,  and  Uranus,  the  planet of lightning-like

action,  which precludes forethought.   When action is dictated by intuition
generated under good aspects,  all is well and the person is better off than
when  he  is  forced  to  use  the  comparatively  slow  reason.   But  when

it  is  generated  under  the  adverse  aspects  of  the  square and opposi-
tion,  it results in such rattle-brained foolhardiness and absolute lack  of
thought and intelligence that the person is generally mentally  incompetent.
So we see at the very first glance that we have here  before us a person who


[PAGE 652]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

on account of weak mentality is apt to get into trouble and accidents.   But
the injuries which he has received in consequence of his lack of forethought
were all to the head and as the horoscope does not show any serious  afflic-
tion  to Aries,  which rules the head,  except that Mars and Mercury,  which
rule the two hemispheres of the cerebrum, are square, what then caused these
accidents,  we may ask.   The answer is found in the progression of the Sun,
which corresponds with the time when this person was injured,  the Moon also
bearing its part in bringing about these accidents.   In 1876,  when he  was
eleven years of age,  the Sun and Moon were both in conjunction with Neptune
in the sign Aries and at that time he met with an accident which caused  the
first injury to his head.   In 1896 the progressed Sun was in opposition  to
Saturn  from Aries;  you will notice that Saturn is retrograde so  that  al-
though  he is in the last degrees of Libra his influence is thrown  backward
into that sign and works as an opposition between Libra and Aries, affecting
the head.   The Sun was also parallel to Saturn and this is one of the  most
inimical influences in the whole gamut,  for it destroys all vitality of the
person who is under its sway for a number of years.  (One of the writers can
testify to this from personal experience,  having felt it for ten or  twelve
years.)  At the same time the progressed Moon was in opposition to Mars  and
Uranus  and  square  to  the  Sun and Mercury at birth; thus there were very


[PAGE 653]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

severe afflictions at that time and the poor man suffered a considerable in-
jury.

   The third accident came in 1908, at the age of forty-three.  At that time
the  Sun  was in opposition to the Moon's radical place and  the  progressed
Moon was in conjunction with Uranus and Mars, square to the Sun and Mercury,
radix.   The opposition of the Sun to the Moon occurred from  Taurus,  which
governs the lower part of the head, where he was hurt.

   In  consequence of these various accidents the man is now suffering  from
chronic headaches and he is on the verge of insanity.   Various doctors have
been  called on for advice but no one is able to put his finger on the  seat
of  the  trouble.   Consulting our ephemeris we find that during  the  man's
lifetime  Saturn  will continue to retrograde further back into  Libra,  and
that  his influence in Aries is becoming stronger with every  year.   Saturn
always causes bruises and depression;  we are therefore satisfied that there
must be a depression of the skull and an examination should be made to  find
this and have it removed.   But he square of the Sun and Mercury to Mars and
Uranus in Gemini,  which rules the lungs, shows also that there is something
the matter with the oxygenation of the system, and Saturn in Libra indicates
that there is a scarcity of urine.  These defects can be remedied by breath-
ing exercises and through regulating the diet.  When that is done there will
be at least a large measure of relief.

   As  the  hour of birth of the person in this horoscope is not  known,  we
place Aries in the First House, Taurus in the second, etc.

   Mercury and the Moon are significators of the mind,  and we find them  in
opposition.   This  in itself is not a sign of good mentality.   We  further
find that Jupiter in the mercurial  sign Gemini is square to Uranus in Virgo


[PAGE 655]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

16-20 and Mars is also in the sign Virgo,;  thus all the significators point
to a weak and even an erratic mentality.  In the last few years Mercury has,
moreover, progressed past the natal places of Uranus and Mars, thus accentu-
ating the trouble.

   A  person may,  however,  have a weak mind and yet it may not become  en-
tirely unbalanced,  provided there are no other malefic aspects between  the
natal planets or the progressed positions.   The person may be constitution-
ally  below the stature of the normal mind,  and still retain unto the  last
sufficient hold upon himself or herself so that it does not become an actual
disease.

   When we look for the signs of disability in a horoscope like the present,
we turn to the aspects for our information.  Saturn, it appears,  as in con-
junction with the Dragon's Tail ( 26-10 ),  and this adds to his malefic in-
fluence;  he is further in conjunction with Neptune in 18 degrees of Taurus,
and also with the fixed star Alcyone in 29 degrees of Taurus.   As Saturn is
the planet of obstruction and Taurus rules the throat we naturally look  for
some  obstruction in that region,  and we find that a concretion  has  taken
place,  a growth,  a crystallization known as Goitre,  a disease which  also
further  bears out the indications in the former aspects which we have  dis-
cussed.

   Were  it  not  for good aspects which we  have  not  hitherto  mentioned,
namely,  the  sextile of Saturn to Mercury and its trine to the  Moon,  this
person would certainly have become  an  inmate of an insane asylum, but this


[PAGE 656]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

is  one of the few cases where Saturn really helps in a material sense,  for
even  his good aspects will obstruct when coming to the other  planets;  but
when this obstruction is applied to the Moon,  the flightiest planet of all,
and to Mercury,  the one next to her in swiftness and instability,  both  of
then significators of the mind,  Saturn does really help to hold the flighty
mind in check,  and such a weak mental condition as the one found here  will
be vastly benefited by these aspects,  whereas if there are no evil  aspects
the  sextile of Mercury and Saturn will strengthen the mind in  a  wonderful
degree.

   As  Saturn in Taurus always affects the functions of the  opposite  sign,
Scorpio, namely elimination, it is of great importance to see that both kid-
neys and bowels act freely with a person like this.   Nothing but  distilled
water should be taken into the system on any account.  As the muscles of the
beck are always strained in hill and star climbing,  a person with this dis-
ease  should  be housed on a level and on the lower floor of the  house.   A
vegetarian diet consisting of uncooked food is preferable to any other,  and
it  is particularly necessary to get the vegetable salts which may tone  the
body  and bring the standard of general health as high as possible;  lettuce
is the best single vegetable for this purpose.

   This is the horoscope of a young man born on September 6,  1900,  at 6:00
A.M.,  and the disability complained of is weakness in the back  and  limbs,
which  prevents  him  for  moving  about  normally.  Astrologically  we find


[PAGE 658]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

that this is due to several causes.   In  the  first place,  there  are four
Common signs on the angles,  the Sixth  House  sign,  Virgo,  being  on  the
Ascendant which governs the condition of the body.   It is  a vital point in
that  respect.  This  in itself shows his somewhat  indolent  nature  and  a
tendency to give up very easily.   We also find  Mercury, the  ruler  of the
Ascendant,  in the Twelfth House,  denoting hospitals  and chronic  illness;
he is square to Jupiter and Uranus,  which are placed  in  Sagittarius,  the
sign  which  governs the hips and the great  sciatic  nerve.  The  Sun,  the
giver  of  life,  is  also  square  to Uranus,  the planet of  irregularity,
which is conjoined with Jupiter in Sagittarius.   And  finally, Saturn,  the
ruler of the bony structure and its articulations, is placed  in Sagittarius
in opposition to Neptune, in Gemini.   All  these  configurations  naturally
tend  to bring about the conditions complained of  if  nothing  is  done  to
prevent;  but  in  this  case,  with  four  Common,  flexible  signs  on the
angles,  with the life-giving Sun sextile to Mars, the planet of dynamic en-
ergy,  and with the Moon sextile to Jupiter,  the planet governing the arte-
rial blood,  it is quite possible to obtain relief by means obtain relief by
means of exercises which will remove the sluggish conditions.

   But  we  also find other weaknesses of a serious nature  latent  in  this
horoscope.   Uranus is in conjunction with nebulous star Antares  in  Sagit-
tarius 8 degrees,  square to the Sun and Mercury.  This implies a grave dan-
ger  to  the  sight  and also to the hearing because of Mercury being in the


[PAGE 659]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

Twelfth House.   These conditions can certainly be overcome if the ounce  of
prevention is applied.   We take it that because the man is not able to oth-
erwise occupy himself he is an inveterate reader and this will bring trouble
if  persisted in.   Massage of the head in the region of the eyes and  ears,
and  exercise of the limbs and body will aid in restoring this young man  to
health.   A healer with Taurus on the Ascendant whose Saturn is not  in  the
patient's Sixth House will probably have the most persistence in the perfor-
mance of his work.

NO. 31--EYE AND EAR TROUBLE, POOR CIRCULATION

   Mercury,  the significator of mind,  rises BEFORE the Sun and is  in  the
Twelfth House,  conjunction Neptune, its higher octave.  This shows that the
mind  is naturally inclined toward the higher and more spiritual  things  of
life,  through Jupiter square Mercury from the house of mind indicates  that
under  severe afflictions this woman may at times follow the example of  Job
and  reason  with God concerning the hard fate she has to bear.   The  Moon,
which is the other significator of mind, square Venus, shows us that consid-
erable sorrow may be expected in this life;  but the conjunction of  Mercury
with the mystical Neptune in the Twelfth House gives her a certain degree of
spiritual development,  which brings much comfort through her communion with
the  higher  worlds,  compensating her for her isolation.   Jupiter  is  the
Midheaven  trine  to  the Ascendant causes her to look upon life from a more

hopeful  angle than even people who are not at all afflicted (in  comparison
with her), and the strength of her hope is bound to help her in a degree be-

and melancholy is thereby made more unhappy or unhealthy, so also the person
who  constantly keeps an optimistic spirit is bound to gain  thereby  corre-
spondingly in health and happiness.   The Sun on the Ascendant,  even though
it is afflicted by a square of Uranus,  is nevertheless a valuable asset  in
recuperation.  The Sun sextile Saturn will give her a persistence,  a  tena-


[PAGE 661]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

of life, that will not let go despite all discouragements.

   This  woman has been deaf since she was five years of age and  this  dis-
ability is indicated by the position of Mercury in the Twelfth House, by his
conjunction with Neptune, and his square to Jupiter.  This latter aspect in-
dicates  that it is sluggish circulation of the blood which  is  responsible
for  the  disability.   These aspects of Mercury also make  her  dumb,  par-
ticularly because Mercury is in Taurus, which governs the vocal organs.  She
has nevertheless learned to talk,  showing that there is no organic disabil-
ity but only a functional weakness.

   But these are not all of the poor woman's afflictions.   You will  notice
that the Sun is in Taurus 29.  In other words, it is in conjunction with the
Pleiades,  a  nebular spot in the Zodiac.  It is also square to  Uranus  and
parallel to Mars.   Therefore the eyes are sorely afflicted;  one is  almost
blind,  the other not much better, so that there is danger that she may lose
her sight entirely.

   On  account  of her afflictions and the position in which  she  has  been
placed,  this woman has been unable to get an education.   Nevertheless,  by
persistence indicated by Saturn sextile the Sun,  she has accomplished much.
She writes a really beautiful letter which tells how she was in  comfortable
circumstances up to 1906,  when the earthquake in San Francisco deprived her
of her all,  and still she has not given up hope.  Her mental attitude,  in-
spired by her Sun conjunction Ascendant and sextile Saturn,  is justified in


[PAGE 662]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

quite  a large measure.   The trouble comes from Saturn,  the planet of  ob-
struction,  in Aries, the sign which governs the head, and the square of Ju-
piter,  the planet which governs arterial circulation, to Mercury in Taurus,
the  sign which governs the throat.  There were also signs of  malnutrition,
indicated  by  the presence of Mars in Cancer,  the sign which  governs  the
stomach,  square Venus, which governs the venous circulation.  If the system
could be given the proper amount and kind of food and the head and neck mas-
saged  with special attention to manipulations of the ears and eyes,  condi-
tions  might be considerably relieved and further progress of  deterioration
stopped.   An Aquarian whose Saturn is not in Libra or Scorpio would have  a
most beneficial effect in this case.

   Regarding  the mentality of this person, we find that the conjunction  of
Saturn and Mercury, particularly in the Eighth House sign,  Scorpio,  clouds
the  mind with gloom.   The Moon,  which is the other significator of  mind,
conjunction  Mars  in  the  Ninth  House  sign,  Sagittarius, would have the

tendency  is  somewhat softened and toned down by the presence of  Venus  in
conjunction with these planets, and we may therefore conclude that this per-
son is apt to be very much depressed in mind  whenever  misfortune overtakes


[PAGE 664]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

him;  that he rebels,  at least inwardly, very strongly against the blows of
fate, though Venus may prevent him from expressing his disappointments.

   With regard to the ailments to which this person is subject,  we find  in
the first place that Jupiter square to Mercury and Saturn,  the latter being
in  Scorpio,  which rules the rectum, gives a tendency to  constipation  and
hemorrhoids.  This configuration also interferes with the circulation of the
arterial blood.  His disability is further enhanced by the square of Jupiter
to the Sun,  the latter planet being ruler of the organ which circulates the
vital fluid.

   But  there is a great misfortune in this life,  compared with  which  the
troubles  previously mentioned pale into insignificance.   The Sun and  Mars
are  in conjunction with the fixed star Antares in eight degrees  of  Sagit-
tarius,  and this configuration always brings trouble to the eyes, though it
may not result in blindness from birth.  In the present case the crisis came
when  the Sun had progressed to the opposition of Uranus,  at the same  time
striking the square to Neptune.   In that year the Moon also was in conjunc-
tion with Neptune in the sign Aries, which rules the head.  This kindled the
double fire of Mars and the Sun at birth,  with the result that inflammation
of the eyes made the man blind beyond hope of recovery.

   It  may  seen  strange  that the  writers  selected  this  horoscope  for
analysis,  as the patient is beyond help, but if offers certain points which
it will be  well  for the student to impress upon his mind.  You will notice


[PAGE 665]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

that Mars is trine to Neptune,  and that the Sun is only about seven degrees
from  a trine to Neptune.   The culmination of the latter aspect will  occur
before even the vital body is brought to birth.  This is a very good indica-
tion  that  THE SPIRITUAL SIGHT MAY BE AWAKENED in this person and  that  it
will compensate,  or more than compensate, for the loss of the physical fac-
ulty.   There is,  however, as you will also note, the square of Neptune and
Uranus which makes for mediumship; on that account it would be advisable for
this  person  to  be  very closely on his guard during  the  time  when  the
spiritual  faculty is being developed,  and until he is perfectly  safe  and
balanced in the other world;  and it would be a great privilege for a healer
receiving  such a case to aid a person stricken by the misfortune of  blind-
ness to cultivate the latent faculty shown by the horoscope.

or  "SPUNKEY,"  as once happened to the writer when he was broken down  from
overwork.  He went to a hospital to get nursing and quiet, and had to engage
a regular doctor to comply with the rules.  He knew that his condition would


[PAGE 667]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

not change till the Moon did, and lay patiently waiting, though the case was
approaching a crises, for his mind was too lethargic to set to work;  HE EX-
PECTED THE MOON TO DO IT ALL at the proper time.   But on the day of the New
Moon his doctor came in with another, and both had faces a yard long.   They
did not think he had another hour to live;  and he laughed,  but it made him
"mad,"  and he commenced to work on himself with the result that the dropsi-
cal swelling which had almost reached his heart, was gone in a few hours and
he was out in the sunshine getting a dose of new life.   Before a month  had
elapsed  he  had  not only left the hospital behind,  but  had  written  THE
ROSICRUCIAN  PHILOSOPHY.   There is no doubt that the fluid could  not  have
been eliminated before the change of the Moon,  but the co-operation of  his
mental  attitude was necessary to help the lunar forces,  and combined  with
proper action it brought results.   Similarly in every case,  the right  at-
titude of the mind must be cultivated or cure is impossible.

   This figure shows an unfortunate person,  for the mind is in a bad state.
Saturn is square to the Sun, Moon and Venus.  The Moon,  which signifies the
instinctual mind, is in opposition to the Sun and Venus, robbing life of all
joy,  making her pessimistic and prone to look only on the dark side.   Mer-
cury,  the planet of reason,  is square to Neptune,  the planet of spiritual
perception,  all these testimonies tell us that nothing we may say is likely
to make her cheer up.


[PAGE 668]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

   Such a poor person is a burden to herself and her associates all  through
life, so they shun her while she is able to take care of herself, that is to
say, while the body is in comparative health; but the afflictions which make
her mentally miserable also have their effect on the body,  for as we  mould
the  lines  of  our  face to an exact expression of  our  habitual  mode  of
thought,  so are also our other organs shaped and built by this  force,  and
the evil effects show themselves as disease.  The Sun,  Venus and mercury in
the  Eighth House indicate that when sickness comes she is going to  let  it
take its course, and will make no effort to fight for life.

   The  nature of her sickness is seen to be heart trouble,  from  the  fact
that the Sun is on the cusp of Leo, which governs the heart,  in conjunction
with Venus,  which governs the venous circulation,  and opposed by the Moon,
which  rules  the  liquids of the body.  The Sun,  Venus and  the  Moon  are
squared by Saturn, the planet of obstruction, and thus we see that there was
a natal tendency to poor heart action and faulty elimination of liquids.

   In  1913 the Sun progressed to the conjunction of Uranus and  Mars.   The
aspects  of the Sun are always effective for three years,  one and  one-half
years before the aspect is exact, and a like period after.  Therefore it was
still active in 1914,  when the Moon progressed to the conjunction of Saturn
and thus enlivened this square to the Sun, Moon and Venus.  Neptune, the wa-
tery planet, also reached the natal  Sun  by  transit, and the poor soul was


[PAGE 669]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

released by the total obstruction of the liquids; in other words,  the drop-
sical condition stopped the heart.

   The  main effort in such cases should be to get the person to fight.   If
she could have been made to see that it was her gloomy outlook on life  that
was responsible for her sickness and that if she did not fight here and now,
she  would have a harder fate to face next time,  it might have helped.   No
person who is naturally pessimistic can change over night,  but he can do  a
whole lot to cultivate optimism if given years,  and we should strive to in-
culcate  this attitude of mind in all,  BESIDES TRYING TO BE  CHEERFUL  OUR-
SELVES, for that is a healer's greatest asset.

                    NO. 34.--SEX, EYE AND THROAT TROUBLE

   The type of mind is denoted particularly here by the square of Saturn  to
the Sun.   This occurs from Cardinal signs,  Saturn being essentially digni-
fied and therefore very powerful, while the Sun is in Libra, the sign of its
debility and greatest weakness.  Life and joy come from the Sun,  while Sat-
urn gives gloom and death.   Therefore we readily see that this person  must
be subject to gloom and melancholy.   The sextile of Uranus to Mercury,  the
significator  of mind,  tells that the person is endowed with an almost  un-
canny  lightining-like intuition,  and the square of Uranus to the Moon  and
Venus shows that she is indiscreet and too weak for her own good.


[PAGE 670]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

You will notice that this square occurs from the Fixed signs,  Leo and Scor-
pio,  and it is therefore a condition which would be very difficult to over-
come.   Leo governs the heart,  and Scorpio the generative organs,  and thus
her secret is told in the horoscope in unmistakable terms.

When such secrets of the soul are revealed by this sacred science,  it shows
us  also  the hidden springs which are causes of the acts we  are  only  too
prone to condemn,  and it teaches us that we should pity rather than censure
a soul impelled by such an almost irresistible force as here revealed.


[PAGE 671]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

The act itself should, of course, never be condoned, but the tenderest kind-
ness  and  the greatest effort to succor should be given to the one  who  is
thus Aquarius.

   The horoscope is,  as you know,  the clock of destiny,  and the  position
taken by the planets at birth give certain tendencies for life.   From  that
natal  position the planets move on to different positions with  every  year
that passes,  as the hands of a clock move around its face;  thus they bring
to pass events foreshown at birth.   Now you will notice that the Sun is  in
eleven  degrees of Libra in this horoscope, so at nineteen years of age  the
Sun entered the sign Scorpio.  At twenty-two it reached the conjunction with
the  Moon and Venus and a couple of years later the square with  Uranus  was
reached.   During this period the unfortunate tendency spoken  of  developed
and the seeds of disease were sown which resulted in a number of operations,
both in the lower regions and in the throat,  for you must remember that the
opposite is always afflicted.   The generative organ can never be hurt with-
out in some measures it counterpart,  the larynx and throat,  also being af-
fected.   During the years which intervened between that time and  1914  the
Sun had pursued its path through Scorpio,  and reached the affliction of Ju-
piter,  which occurs from the sign Leo in 23 degrees.   This square was also
augmented  by the fact that the Moon in its circle around the horoscope  had
been going through Taurus,  so that was an opposition of the progressed  Sun
and Moon, both of them squaring  the  planet  Jupiter at the same time.  The


[PAGE 672]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

Sun's  square to Jupiter will for a few years be an affliction to this  poor
person.   Uranus at birth was also on the Ascelli in Leo,  the nebulous spot
that is so dangerous to the eyes, and from there it squares the Moon.  This,
also,  is another danger which faces this person,  for ,  as you  know,  eye
trouble is very often the accompaniment of indiscretion.

   Now  comes the question as to what can be done for this poor person.   As
we have often stated, the first effort should be toward instilling hope into
the  mind.   Persons suffering with melancholy are  always  centering  their
thoughts upon self, always seeing their own desperate position which appears
to them more hopeless than that of any other.   If their interest can be di-
verted from self then the battle is more than half won;  that should be  the
first consideration of the healer.

   A simple diet should be prescribed and no highly seasoned dishes  permit-
ted a person of this nature.   The sextile of Uranus to the Sun and  Mercury
and  the trine of Neptune to Jupiter shows that an appeal along  the  higher
lines,  an appeal to the better and noble nature will not meet with a rebuff
and  it is possible on account of these positions to elevate  this  person's
ideas  and  ideals so that she may become a servant of humanity  instead  of
driftwood upon the ocean of life.   You will note that all the good  aspects
are from Cardinal and Fixed signs,  that the Common signs are void of  plan-
ets, hence there is a great deal of hope.  There  is  energy in this person,


[PAGE 673]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

and  when this energy has been turned in the right direction,  when she  has
become thoroughly aroused, then the great sinner may become the great saint,
and a blessing to humanity.

[PAGE 674]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

   This is the horoscope of a woman born May 21, 1883, at 5 A.M.,  Longitude
88 West, Latitude 44, North.  The student will at once note that five of the
nine planets are placed in the Twelfth House, which governs sorrow, trouble,
and self-undoing.  This has been a characteristic feature in the life.   She
is a competent worker in her vocation, stenography and bookkeeping, but has,
nevertheless, found herself unable to obtain employment at various times and
has been at those times on the verge of starvation.   This is due to the op-
position  of  Saturn and Neptune from the Twelfth House to the Moon  in  the
Sixth, the house of employment.  Jupiter, though exalted in the Second House
and sextile Venus, is unable to offset this.

   With  respect to the mental qualities we find that Mercury is  square  to
Uranus,  and the Moon in opposition to Neptune.   This makes her  skeptical,
critical,  very peculiar and spasmodic in her mental processes,  with an ex-
tremely morbid imagination.  Uranus is placed in the Fifth House,  governing
courtship  and the relations among the sexes prior to marriage,  and  there-
fore,  squared to Mercury,  it indicates an unconventional turn of the mind,
with  a tendency to promiscuous relations,  involving public  criticism  and
slander.   That in itself is an extremely unfortunate configuration and con-
dition in a life,  but it is only one of a number of afflictions which point
in  the  same direction,  for in the Twelfth House,  the  house  of  sorrow,
trouble,  and  self-undoing,  we  find  Mars,  the planet of dynamic energy,


[PAGE 675]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

conjoined with Venus,  the planet of love, in the fiery sign Aries,  another
inflammatory sex condition; and last, but not least, we note Neptune in Tau-
rus, opposition to the Moon in Scorpio, which governs the generative organs.
This  latter  is the worst of all for it makes the mind almost  insane  upon
this subject, conjuring up before the imagination morbid pictures, and where
the  configuration occurs from the Sixth and Twelfth Houses it is a  certain
indication of inveterate self-abuse.   Naturally such practices in time  un-
dermine the health and disease shows itself in the weakest parts of the body
according to the indications of the horoscope.   In the present case we find
Saturn  on the cusp of Gemini in conjunction with the Sun.   Gemini  is  the
sign which rules the lungs,  and the conjunction as we see is almost  exact,
wanting only 26 minutes.  Thus the cold,  crystallizing saturnine forces are
hardening the lungs and producing the disease we know as tuberculosis, which
is  slowly sapping her vitality and carrying her toward an early grave.   It
may  be  noted in passing that her mother succumbed to tuberculosis  at  the
very moment when she gave birth to this child.   Mars by progression has now
arrived close to the place of Neptune at birth.   This will unfortunately in
all  probability accentuate the morbid craving indicated by Neptune  opposi-
tion  to the Moon,  so that if left to herself the end will not be very  far
off.

   Tuberculosis though serious is not, however, necessarily fatal if she can


[PAGE 676]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

be put under restraint so that it becomes impossible for her to gratify  the
passion for solitary vice that saps her vitality.   Thus the spells of gloom
which  are also resultant from the conjunction of Saturn and the Sun in  the
Twelfth  House can be overcome if she can be given a brighter  outlook  upon
life.   Then the usual measures employed against tuberculosis  may  probably
save her.    The occult has an intense attraction for her,  indicated by the
exact trine of Neptune and Uranus,  also by Uranus sextile to the Moon.   By
playing  upon those strings and giving her a new interest in life it may  be
possible  to win her away from her present morbid channels of  thought.   At
any  rate  salvation from the evil configurations should  always  be  sought
through the good aspects and substituting the higher for the lower may  help
this poor soul out of her condition.  Very little can be done physically un-
til the mental condition is changed.  A healer with either Libra or Aquarius
rising and whose Saturn is not in Libra or Scorpio would be beneficial,  but
much firmness is needed here and therefore probably the Fixed sign would  be
preferable.

   This is the horoscope of a young man born in Boynton,  Missouri,  October
11,  1889, at 6:00 P.M.  It is a strange case which has puzzled all the doc-
tors who have been consulted.  About five years ago the joins in arms,

legs  and neck commenced to grow stiff, so that by degrees he became  unable
to move.   At the same time there appeared, instead of the nails,  a strange
horny growth on fingers and toes; this grows to a certain length or stage of
development and then it begins to suppurate.  This facilities the removal of


[PAGE 678]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

growth and when that has been completed the suppuration ceases,  but immedi-
ately  a new growth begins to form.  Lately the jaws have also commenced  to
grow stiff, so that now the young man can no longer eat with comfort.

   The  very first glance at the horoscope shows us Uranus,  the  planet  of
spasmodic action, in conjunction with the Sun, and in the sign Libra,  which
rules  the  kidneys.   WE also note that Uranus is parallel with  Mars,  the
planet of dynamic energy;  this shows at once that the action of the kidneys
is  spasmodic and irregular so that instead of the poisons being  eliminated
from  the body by these organs they are retained and  naturally  contaminate
the  whole  system.   But we also find that this patient is  poisoned  to  a
greater extend than ordinarily by a venereal disease contracted about  seven
to  eight years ago;  this is shown as a tendency in the natal horoscope  by
the conjunction of Venus,  the planet of love, with Mars,  the planet of dy-
namic energy,  in the Fifth House, which governs courtship and the relations
of  the sexes before marriage.   Saturn is also there with  his  obstructive
hand  and square to Neptune,  the planet which governs strange  and  unusual
conditions.   Neptune is in the sign Gemini,  which rules the hands and fin-
gers.   About seven years ago,  when the Moon was in Pisces by  progression,
the  sign which governs the toes,  it was in opposition to Venus,  Mars  and
Saturn  and square to Neptune.   We base our judgment that the  disease  was
contracted at that time  on  the  fact  that  the  afflicting planets are in


[PAGE 679]                                     THIRTY-SIX EXAMPLE HOROSCOPES

Common or flexible signs; hence it could have been avoided much effort.   As
it  is,  the  most drastic measures for purification of the  blood  must  be
adopted;  the patient should be brought to California,  treated  with  daily
sun-baths  to facilitate copious perspiration, and given nothing  but  water
and fruit juices until the system has been cleansed.

                               PLANETARY HOURS

   Measures  for  the alleviation of pain and disease cannot always  be  de-
ferred  to a propitious time,  but where that is possible the  student  will
find that remedial treatments given under the propitious planetary rays  are
much  more efficient and successful than when applied haphazard.   Therefore
the following hints may be found valuable.

   Surgeons who have watched and tabulated these matters inform us that  the
operations  performed while the Moon is increasing in light (see  Page  521)
are generally more successful,  less liable to cause complications and  more
quickly  healed  than operations performed with the Moon  is  decreasing  in
light.

   When a surgical operations seems unavoidable consult the ephemeris and if
the  Moon is going through the sign which rules that part of the body  where
the  operation  is to be performed defer it for a day to two till  the  Moon
gets  well into the next sign.   This will minimize the danger of  complica-
tions,  and  not  infrequently  the symptoms change  so  that  operation  is
avoided.


[PAGE 680]                                          THE MESSAGE OF THE STARS

   Always  look to the benefics and the good aspects in a horoscope for  di-
rections concerning how and when to treat.   Suppose the Sun,  the giver  of
life, is square to Saturn, the planet of stagnation and death.  The tendency
is to rob the person of vitality and if he is taken ill recuperation will be
very slow.   Then, to give the most effective and energizing treatment apply
the  principle of the day and hour rulers as given in our SIMPLIFIED  SCIEN-
TIFIC  ASTROLOGY;  choose the Sun's day (Sunday) and the hours ruled by  the
Sun  on any day.   Treatments on Mars' day (Tuesday) and the hours ruled  by
Mars on any day,  will also build up wonderfully.   Similarly with the other
planets, their virtues and power is greatest during the days ruled by them.

   But the so-called malefics also have their virtues.   Poultices  intended
to draw suppuration from a wound, or bring a boil to a head are most effica-
cious  on the hot and inflammatory Mars' day (Tuesday),  or in the hours  of
Mars on any day,  but applications made to disperse a swelling are most suc-
cessful when applied on the day of Saturn, the planet of suppression,  or in
his hours on any day.

   Treatments received on the day and in the hours of the planets which  are
well  aspected in the patient's horoscope are always more powerful and  ben-
eficial  than they would be if given in the hours and on the days  ruled  by
planets afflicted when he was born.

   We  have  now given an exposition of the methods we use in  diagnosis  of
disease.   This we trust will enable the student to work out the subject  of
himself in greater detail.   And as he uses it unselfishly to aid  suffering
human beings,  the spiritual qualities will be developed in him so that  THE
MESSAGE  OF  THE STARS revealed in each horoscope will be as an  open  book.
Thus used, this wonderful science will aid him to lay up treasures in heaven
as nothing else in the world can do.   And we pray God that this book may be
the means of fostering soul growth in all who aspire to follow the dual com-
mandment of Christ:

   "PREACH the Gospel and HEAL the sick."
