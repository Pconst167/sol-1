                              CREED OR CHRIST

No man loves God who hates his kind,
    Who tramples on his brother's heart and soul;
Who seeks to shackle, cloud, or fog the mind
    By fears of hell has not perceived our goal.

God-sent are all religions blest;
    And Christ, the Way, the Truth, the Life,
To give the heavy laden rest
    And peace from sorrow, sin, and strife.

Behold the Universal Spirit came
    To ALL the churches, not to one alone;
On Pentecostal morn a tongue of flame
    Round EACH apostle as a halo shone.

Since then, as vultures ravenous with greed,
    We oft have battled for an empty name,
And sought by dogma, edict, cult, or creed,
    To send each other to the quenchless flame.

Is Christ then twain?  Was Cephas, Paul,
    To save the world, nailed to the tree?
Then why divisions here at all?
    Christ's love enfolds both you and me.

His pure sweet love is not confined
    By creed which segregate and raise a wall.
His love enfolds, embraces human kind,
    No matter what ourselves or Him we call.

Then why not take Him at His word?
    Why hold to creeds which tear apart?
But one thing matters, be it heard
    That brother love fill every heart.

There's but one thing the world has need to know.
    There's but one balm for all our human woe:
There's but one way that leads to heaven above--
    That way is human sympathy and love.

                                  -Max Heindel.


[PAGE 5]                                                  A WORD TO THE WISE


                            A WORD TO THE WISE.


    The  founder  of the Christian Religion stated an occult maxim  when  He
said:   "Whosoever  shall not receive the kingdom of God as a  little  child
shall  not  enter  therein"  (Mark  X:15).   All  occultists  recognize  the
far-reaching importance of this teaching of Christ,  and endeavor to  "live"
it day by day.

    When  a new philosophy is presented to the world it is met in  different
ways by different people.

    One  person will grasp with avidity any new philosophical effort  in  an
endeavor to ascertain how far IT SUPPORTS HIS OWN IDEAS.  To such an one the
philosophy itself is of minor importance.   Its prime value will be its vin-
dication of HIS ideas.  If the work comes up to expectation in that respect,
he  will enthusiastically adopt it and cling to it with a  most  unreasoning
partisanship; if not, he will probably lay the book down in disgust and dis-
appointment, feeling as if the author had done him an injury.

    Another adopts an attitude of skepticism as soon as he discovers that it
contains something which HE has not previously read, heard, or originated in
his own thought.   He would probably resent as extremely unjustified the ac-
cusation  that his mental attitude is the acme of self-satisfaction and  in-
tolerance;  such is nevertheless the case; and thus he shuts his mind to any
truth which may possibly be hidden in that which he off-hand rejects.

    Both these classes stand in their own light.   "Set"  ideas render  them
impervious to rays of truth.  "A little child"  is  the very opposite of its



[PAGE 6]                                                  A WORD TO THE WISE

elders in that respect.   It is not imbued with an overwhelming sense of su-
perior  knowledge,  nor does it feel compelled to look wise or to  hide  its
nescience  of any subject by a smile or a sneer.   It is  frankly  ignorant,
unfettered  by preconceived opinions and therefore EMINENTLY TEACHABLE.   It
takes everything with that beautiful attitude of trust which we have  desig-
nated "child-like faith," wherein there is not the shadow of a doubt.  There
the child holds the teaching it receives until proven or disproven.

    In all occult schools the pupil is first taught to forget all else  when
a new teaching is being given,  to allow neither preference nor prejudice to
govern,  but  to keep the mind in a state of calm,  dignified  waiting.   As
skepticism  will  blind us to truth in the most effective  manner,  so  this
calm,  trustful attitude of the mind will allow the intuition,  or "teaching
from  within,"  to become aware of the truth contained in  the  proposition.
That is the only way to cultivate an absolutely certain perception of truth.

    The pupil is not required to believe off-hand that a given object  which
he has observed to be white, is really black,  when such a statement is made
to  him;  but  he must cultivate an attitude of mind  which  "believeth  all
things"  AS POSSIBLE.  That will allow him to put by for the time being even
what are generally considered "established facts,"  and investigate if  per-
chance there be another viewpoint hitherto unobserved by him whence the  ob-
ject referred to would appear black.  Indeed,  he would not allow himself to
look upon anything as "AN ESTABLISHED FACT,"  for he realizes thoroughly the
importance  of keeping his mind in the fluidal state of  ADAPTABILITY  which
characterizes  the little child.   He realizes in every fibre of  his  being
that "now we see through a glass,  darkly,"  and Ajax-like he is ever on the
alert, yearning for "Light, more Light."


[PAGE 7]                                                  A WORD TO THE WISE

    The  enormous advantage of such an attitude of mind  when  investigating
any given subject, object or idea must be apparent.  Statements which appear
positively  and unequivocally contradictory,  which have caused  an  immense
amount of feeling among the advocates of opposite sides, may nevertheless be
capable of perfect reconciliation,  as shown in one such instance  mentioned
in  the present work.   THE BOND OF CONCORD IS ONLY DISCOVERED BY  THE  OPEN
MIND,  however, and though the present work may be found to differ from oth-
ers,  the writer would bespeak an impartial hearing as the basis  of  SUBSE-
QUENT judgment.  If the book is "weighed and found wanting," the writer will
have no complaint.  He only fears a hasty judgment based upon lack of knowl-
edge of the system he advocates--a hearing wherein the judgment is "wanting"
in consequence of having been denied an impartial "weighing."  He would fur-
ther submit,  that the only opinion worthy of the one who expresses it  MUST
BE BASED UPON KNOWLEDGE.

    As  a further reason for care in judgment we suggest that to many it  is
exceedingly difficult to retract a hastily expressed opinion.   Therefore it
is urged that the reader withhold all expressions of either praise or  blame
until  study  of the work has reasonably satisfied him of its merit  or  de-
merit.

    The Rosicrucian Cosmo-conception is not dogmatic, neither does it appeal
to any other authority than the reason of the student.  It is not controver-
sial,  but is sent forth in the hope that is may help to clear some  of  the
difficulties  which  have  beset the minds of students of  the  deeper  phi-
losophies  in  the past.   In order to avoid  serious  misunderstanding,  it
should be firmly impressed upon the mind of the student, however, that there



[PAGE 8]                                                  A WORD TO THE WISE

is no infallible revelation of this complicated subject,  which includes ev-
erything under the sun and above it also.

    An  infallible exposition would predicate omniscience upon the  part  of
the writer,  and even the Elder Brothers tell us that they are sometimes  at
fault  in  their judgment,  so a book which shall say the last word  on  the
World-Mystery  is out of the question,  and the writer of the  present  work
does  not  pretend to give aught but the most elementary  teachings  of  the
Rosicrucians.

    The Rosicrucian Brotherhood has the most far-reaching,  the most logical
conception of the World-Mystery of which the writer has gained any knowledge
during  the many years he has devoted exclusively to the study of this  sub-
ject.   So far as he has been able to investigate, their teachings have been
found in accordance with facts as he knows them.   Yet he is convinced  that
the  Rosicrucian  Cosmo-conception is far from being the last  word  on  the
subject;  that  as we advance greater vistas of truth will open  to  us  and
make clear many things which we now "see through a glass,  darkly."   At the
same time he firmly believes that all other philosophies of the future  will
follow the same main lines, for they appear to be absolutely true.

    In view of the foregoing it will be plain that this book is not  consid-
ered by the writer as the Alpha and Omega, the ultimate of occult knowledge,
and even though is entitled "The Rosicrucian Cosmo-conception,"  the  writer
desires to strongly emphasize that is not to be understood as a "faith  once
for all delivered"  to the Rosicrucians by a founder of the Order or by  any
other  individual.   It is emphatically stated that THIS WORD EMBODIES  ONLY
THE  WRITER'S  UNDERSTANDING  OF THE ROSICRUCIAN  TEACHINGS  concerning  the
World-Mystery,  strengthened  by  his  personal  investigations of the inner



[PAGE 9]                                                  A WORD TO THE WISE

Worlds, the ante-natal and post-mortem states of man, etc.  The responsibil-
ity upon one who wittingly or unwittingly leads others astray is clearly re-
alized by the writer, and he wishes to guard as far as possible against that
contingency, and also to guard others against going wrong inadvertently.

    What  is said in this work is to be accepted or rejected by  the  reader
according to his own discretion.   All care has been used in trying to  make
plain  the teaching;  great pains have been taken to put it into words  that
shall  be easily understood.   For that reason only one term has  been  used
throughout  to convey each idea.   The same word will have the same  meaning
wherever  used.   When any word descriptive of an idea is  first  used,  the
clearest definition possible to the writer is given.  None but English terms
and  the simplest language have been used.  The writer has tried to give  as
exact  and definite descriptions of the subject under consideration as  pos-
sible;  to eliminate all ambiguity and to make everything clear.  How far he
has  succeeded must be left to the student to judge;  but having used  every
possible  means  to  convey the teaching, he feels  obliged  to  guard  also
against the possibility of this work being taken as a verbatim statement  of
the  Rosicrucian  teachings.   Neglect of this precaution might  give  undue
weight to this work in the minds of some students.   That would not be  fair
to  the  Brotherhood  nor  to  the reader.   It  would  tend  to  throw  the
responsibility  upon  the Brotherhood for the mistakes which must  occur  in
this as in all other human works.  Hence the above warming.



[PAGE 10]                                                 A WORD TO THE WISE

    During the four years which have elapsed since the foregoing  paragraphs
were written,  the writer has continued his investigations of the  invisible
worlds,  and  experienced the expansion of consciousness relative  to  these
realms of nature which comes by practice of the precepts taught in the West-
ern  Mystery  School.    Others  also  who  have  followed  the  method   of
soul-unfoldment  herein  described  as particularly suited  to  the  Western
peoples,  have  likewise been enabled to verify for themselves  many  things
here taught.  Thus the writer's understanding of what was given by the Elder
Brothers  has  received some corroboration and seems to have  been  substan-
tially correct,  therefore he feels it a duty to state this for the  encour-
agement of those who are still unable to see for themselves.

    If we said that the vital body is built of PRISMS instead of points,  it
would have been better,  for it is by refraction through these minute prisms
that  the colorless solar fluid changes to a rosy hue as observed  by  other
writers beside the author.

    Other new and important discoveries have also been made;  for  instance,
we know now that the Silver Cord is grown anew in each life,  that one  part
sprouts  from  the seed atom of the desire body in the great vortex  of  the
liver,  that the other part grows out of the seed atom of the dense body  in
the  heart,  that both parts meet in the seed atom of the vital body in  the
solar  plexus,  and that this union of the higher and lower vehicles  causes
the quickening.  Further development of the cord between the heart and solar
plexus during the first seven years has an important bearing on the  mystery
of childlife, likewise its fuller growth from the liver to the solar plexus,
which  takes  place during the second septenary period,  is  a  contributory
cause  of  adolescence.   Completion of the Silver Cord  marks  the  end  of
childlife,  and  from that time the solar energy which  enters  through  the
spleen  and is tinted by refraction through the prismatic seed atom  of  the
vital body located in the solar plexus,  commences to give a distinctive and
individual coloring to the aura which we observe in adults.

                                INTRODUCTION

   The Western world is undoubtedly the vanguard of the human race, and, for
reasons  given in the following pages,  it is held by the  Rosicrucian  that
neither Judaism nor "popular Christianity,"  but true Esoteric  Christianity
is to be its world-religion.

   Buddha,  great, grand and sublime, may be the "light of Asia," but Christ
will yet be acknowledged the "Light of the World."  As the sun outshines the
brightest star in the heavens,  dispels every vestige of darkness and  gives
life and light to all beings, so, in a not too distant future, will the true
religion  of  Christ supersede and obliterate all other  religions,  to  the
eternal benefit of mankind.

   In our civilization the chasm that stretches between mind and heart yawns 
deep and wide and,  as the mind flies on from discovery to discovery in  the
realms of science,  the gulf becomes ever deeper and wider and the heart  is
left further and further behind.  The mind loudly demands and will be satis-
fied with nothing less than a materially demonstrable explanation of man and
his fellow-creatures that make up the phenomenal world.  The heart feels in-
stinctively that there is something greater,  and it years for that which it
feels  is a higher truth than can be grasped by the mind alone.   The  human
soul would fain soar upon ethereal pinions of intuition;  would fain love in
the eternal found of spiritual light and love;  but modern scientific  views
have  shorn  its wings and it sits fettered and mute,  unsatisfied  longings
gnawing at its tendrils as the vulture of Prometheus' liver.




[PAGE 18]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Is this necessary?   Is there no common ground upon which head and  heart
may meet,  each assisting the other,  each by the help of the other becoming
more effective in the search for universal truth,  and each receiving  equal
satisfaction?

   As surely as the pre-existing light created the eye whereby the light  is
seen;  as surely as the primordial desire for growth created  the  digestive
and assimilative system for the attainment of that end; as surely as thought
existed  before the brain and built and still is building the brain for  its
expression;  as surely as the mind is now forging ahead and wringing her se-
crets from nature by the very force of its audacity, just so surely will the
heart find a way to burst its bonds and gratify its longings.  At present it
is shackled by the dominant brain. Some day it will gather strength to burst
its prison bars and become a power greater than the mind.

   It  is  equally  certain that there can be no  contradiction  in  nature,
therefore  the heart and the mind must be capable of uniting.   To  indicate
this common ground is precisely the purpose of this book.  To show where and
how the mind,  helped by the intuition of the heart,  can probe more  deeply
into the mysteries of being than either could do alone; where the heart,  by
union with the mind, can be kept from going astray; where each can have full
scope  for action,  neither doing violence to the other and where both  mind
and heart can be satisfied.

   Only when that co-operation is attained and perfected will man attain the
higher,  truer  understanding of himself and of the world of which he  is  a
part; only that can give him a broad mind and a great heart.



[PAGE 19]                                                       INTRODUCTION

   At every birth what appears to be a new life comes among us.   We see the
little form as it lives and grows,  becoming a factor in our lives for days,
months or years.   At last there comes a day when the form dies and goes  to
decay.   The life that came, whence we know not, has passed to the invisible
beyond,  and in sorrow we ask ourselves, Whence came it?   What was it here?
and Whither has it gone?

    Across  every threshold the skeleton form of Death throws  his  fearsome
shadow.   Old or young, well or ill, rich or poor, all,  all alike must pass
out into that shadow and throughout the ages has sounded the piteous cry for
a solution of the riddle of life--the riddle of death.

    So  far  as the vast majority of people are concerned  the  three  great
questions,  Whence have we come?   Why are we here?   Whither are we  going?
remain  unanswered  to  this  day.   It has unfortunately  come  to  be  the
popularly accepted opinion that nothing can be definitely known about  these
matters  of deepest interest to humanity.   Nothing could be more  erroneous
than such an idea.   Each and every one,  without exception,  may become ca-
pable of obtaining first-hand,  definite information upon this subject;  may
personally investigate the state of the human spirit,  both before birth and
after death.  There is no favoritism, nor are special gifts required.   Each
of us has inherently the faculty for knowing all of  these  matters;  but!--
Yes, there is a "but," and a "BUT" that must be written large.  These facul-
ties are present in all,  though latent in most people.  It requires persis-
tent  effort to awaken them and that seems to be a powerful  deterrent.   If
these faculties,  "awake and aware,"  could be had for a monetary  consider-
ation,  even if the price were high,  many people would pay it to gain  such
immense advantage over their  fellow-men,   but   few   indeed   are   those



[PAGE 20]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

willing  to live the life that is required to awaken them.   That  awakening
comes only by patient, persistent effort.  It cannot be bought;  there is no
royal road to it.

    It  is conceded that practice is necessary to learn to play  the  piano,
and that it is useless to think of being a watchmaker without being  willing
to serve an apprenticeship.   Yet when the matter of the soul,  of death and
the beyond,  of the great causes of being, are the questions at issue,  many
think  they  know as much as anyone and have an equal right  to  express  an
opinion, though they may never have given the subject an hour's study.

    As  a matter of fact,  no one unless qualified by study of  the  subject
should expect serious consideration for an opinion.   In legal cases,  where
experts  are called to testify,  they are first examined as to their  compe-
tency.   The weight of their testimony will be nil, unless they are found to
be  thoroughly proficient in the branch of knowledge regarding  which  their
testimony is sought.

    If, however,  they are found to be qualified--by  study  and  practice--
to  express an expert opinion,  it is received with the utmost  respect  and
deference;  and  if the testimony of one expert is  corroborated  by  others
equally proficient,  the testimony of each additional man adds immensely  to
the weight of the previous evidence.

    The irrefutable testimony of one such man easily counterbalances that of
one or a dozen or a million men who know nothing of that whereof they speak,
for nothing, even though multiplied by a million, will still remain nothing.
This is as true of any other subject as of mathematics.

    As previously said,  we recognize these facts readily enough in material
affairs,  but when things beyond the world of sense, when the super-physical
world is under discussion; when the relations of God to man,  the inner-most



[PAGE 21]                                                       INTRODUCTION

mysteries of the immortal spark of divinity, loosely termed the soul, are to
be  probed,  then each clamors for as serious consideration of his  opinions
and ideas regarding spiritual matters as is given to the sage, who by a life
of patient and toilsome research has acquired wisdom in these higher things.

    Nay,  more;  many will not even content themselves with  claiming  EQUAL
consideration for their opinions,  but will even jeer and scoff at the words
of the sage,  seek to impugn his testimony as fraud,  and,  with the supreme
confidence  of deepest ignorance,  asseverate that as THEY know  nothing  of
such matters, it is absolutely impossible that anyone else can.

    The  man  who  realizes his ignorance has taken the  first  step  toward
knowledge.

    The path to first-hand knowledge is not easy.  Nothing worth having ever
comes without persistent effort.  It cannot be too often repeated that there
are no such things as special gifts of "luck."   All that anyone is or  has,
is the result of effort.   What one lacks in comparison with another is  la-
tent in himself and capable of development by proper methods.

    If the reader, having grasped this idea thoroughly, should ask,  what he
must do to obtain this first-hand knowledge,  the following story may  serve
to impress the idea, which is the central one in occultism:

    A young man came to a sage one day and asked,  "Sire,  what must I do to
become wise?"  The sage vouchsafed no answer.  The youth after repeating his
question a number of times, with a like result, at last left him,  to return
the  next  day with the same question.  Again no answer was  given  and  the
youth returned on the third day, still repeating  his  question,  "Sire what



[PAGE 22]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

must I do to become wise?"

    Finally the sage turned and went down to a near-by river. He entered the
water,  bidding the youth follow him.  Upon arriving at a  sufficient  depth
the  sage took the young man by the shoulders and held him under the  water,
despite his struggles to free himself.  At last,  however,  he released  him
and when the youth had regained his breath the sage questioned him:

    "Son, when you were under the water what did you most desire?"

    The youth answered without hesitation, "Air, air!  I wanted air!"

    "Would you not rather have had riches, pleasure, power or love,  my son?
Did you not think of any of these?"  queried the sage.

    "No,  sire!   I wanted air and though only of air," came the instant re-
sponse.

    "Then,"  said the sage,  "To become wise you must desire wisdom with  as
great intensity as you just now desired air.   You must struggle for it,  to
the exclusion of every other aim in life.  It must be your one and only  as-
piration, by day and by night.  If you seek wisdom with that fervor, my son,
you will surely become wise."

    That is the first and central requisite the aspirant to occult knowledge
must possess--an unswerving desire,  a burning thirst for knowledge;  a zeal
that  allows no obstacle to conquer it;  but the supreme motive for  seeking
this occult knowledge must be an ardent desire to benefit humanity, entirely
disregarding  self  in order to work for others.   Unless  prompted  by  the
motive, occult knowledge is dangerous.

    Without   possessing  these  qualifications--especially  the  latter--in
some measure,  any attempt to tread the arduous path of occultism would be a



[PAGE 23]                                                       INTRODUCTION

hazardous undertaking.   Another prerequisite to this first-hand  knowledge,
however,  is the study of occultism at second-hand.   Certain occult  powers
are necessary for the first-hand investigation of matters connected with the
pre-natal and post-mortem states of man,  but no one need despair of acquir-
ing information about this conditions because of undeveloped occult  powers.
As a man may know about Africa either by going there personally or by  read-
ing descriptions written by travelers who have been there,  so may he  visit
the superphysical realms if he will but qualify himself therefor,  or he may
learn  what  others who have so qualified themselves report as a  result  of
their investigations.

    Christ  said,  "The Truth shall make you free,"  but Truth is not  found
once and forever.   Truth is eternal,  and the quest for Truth must also  be
eternal.   Occultism knows of no "faith once for all delivered."   There are
certain  basic  truths which remain,  but which may be looked at  from  many
sides,  each giving a different view,  which complements the previous  ones;
therefore,  so far as we can see at present,  there is no  such  achievement
possible as arriving at the ultimate truth.

    Wherein  this work differs from some philosophical works the  variations
are caused by difference of viewpoint,  and all respect is paid to the  con-
clusions reached and the ideas set forth by other investigators.   It is the
earnest hope of the writer that the study of the following pages may help to
make the student's ideas fuller and more rounded than they were before.


[PAGE 24]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION


                                 CHAPTER I


                      THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS


     The  first  step  in Occultism is the study of  the  invisible  Worlds.
These Worlds are invisible to the majority of people because of the dormancy
of  the finer and higher senses whereby they may be perceived,  in the  same
way  that  the  Physical World about us is perceived  through  the  physical
senses.   The majority of people are on a similar footing in regard  to  the
super-physical Worlds as the man who is born blind is to our world of sense;
although  light and color are all about him,  he is unable to see them.   To
him they are non-existent and incomprehensible,  simply because he lacks the
sense of sight wherewith to perceive them.   Objects he can feel;  they seem
real; but light and color are beyond his ken.

     So with the greater part of humanity.   They feel,  and see objects and
hear sounds in the Physical World, but the other realms, which the clairvoy-
ant  calls the higher Worlds,  are as incomprehensible to them as light  and
color  are  to the blind man.   Because the blind man cannot see  color  and
light, however, is no argument against their existence and reality.  Neither
is  it an argument,  that because most people cannot see the  super-physical
Worlds  no one can do so.   If the blind an obtains his sight,  he will  see
light and color.   If the higher senses of those blind to the super-physical
Worlds are awakened by proper methods,  they also will be able to behold the
Worlds which are now hidden from them.



[PAGE 25]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

     While many people make the mistake of being incredulous concerning  the
existence or reality of the super-sensuous Worlds,  there are also many  who
go to the other extreme,  and,  having become convinced of the verity of in-
visible Worlds, think that when a person is clairvoyant all truth is at once
open  to him;  that when one can "see,"  he at once "knows all about"  these
higher Worlds.

     This  is  a  great mistake.  We readily recognize the fallacy of such a 
contention in matters of everyday life.  We  do not think that a man who was 
born blind, but has obtained his sight, at once "knows all about" the Physi-
cal World.   Nay, more;  we know that even those of us who have been able to 
see  the  things  about  us  all  our  lives are far from having a universal 
knowledge  of  them.   We  know  that it requires arduous study and years of 
application  to  know  about  even that infinitesimal part of things that we 
handle in our daily lives, and reversing the Hermetic aphorism,  "as  above,
so below,"  we gather at once that it must be the same  in the other Worlds.
At the same time it is also true that there are much greater facilities  for 
acquiring knowledge  in  the super-physical Worlds than in our present dense 
physical condition, but not so great as to eliminate the necessity for close 
study and the possibility of  making a mistake in observation.  In fact, all 
the testimony of reliable and qualified observers prove that much  more care 
in observation is needed there than here. 

     Clairvoyants must first be trained before their observations are of any
real  value,  and the more proficient they become the more modest  they  are
about telling of what they see;  the more they defer to the versions of oth-
ers, knowing how much there is  to learn and realizing how little the single



[PAGE 26]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

investigator can grasp of all the detail incident to his investigations.

     This  also accounts for the varied versions,  which superficial  people
think are an argument against the existence of the higher Worlds.  They con-
tend that if these Worlds exist,  investigators must necessarily bring  back
identical descriptions.  If we take an illustration from everyday life,  the
fallacy of this becomes apparent.

     Suppose  a  newspaper sends twenty reporters to a city with  orders  to
"write it up."   Reporters are,  or ought to be,  trained observers.   It is
their business to see everything and they should be able to give as good de-
scriptions  as can be expected from any source.   Yet it is certain that  of
the twenty reports,  no two would be exactly alike.   It is much more likely
that  they would be totally different.  Although some of them might  contain
leading features in common,  others might be unique in quality and  quantity
of description.

     Is it an argument against the existence of the city that these  reports
differ?   Certainly not!   It is easily accounted for by the fact that  each
saw  the  city from his own particular point of view and  instead  of  these
varying  reports being confusing and detrimental,  it is safe to say that  a
perusal of them all would give a fuller,  better understanding and  descrip-
tion  of the city than if only one were read and the others were  thrown  in
the wastebasket.  Each report would round out and complement the others.

     The same is true regarding accounts made by investigators of the higher
Worlds.  Each has his own peculiar way of looking at things and can describe
only what he sees from his particular point of view.   The account he  gives
may differ from those of others, yet all be equally truthful from each indi-
vidual observer's viewpoint.




[PAGE 27]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

     It  is sometimes asked,  Why investigate these Worlds?   Why is it  not
best  to take one World at a time; to be content for the present  time  with
the lessons to be learned in the Physical World, and, if there are invisible
Worlds  why not wait until we reach them before investigating?   "Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof!"  Why borrow more?

     If we knew without doubt that at some time,  sooner or later,  each one
of us must be transported to a far country where, under new and strange con-
ditions,  we must live for many years, is it not reasonable to believe  that
if we had an opportunity to learn of that country in advance of our  removal
to it we would gladly do so?   Knowledge would render it much easier for  us
to accommodate ourselves to new conditions.

     There is only one certainty in life and that is--Death! As we pass into
the beyond and are confronted by new conditions,  knowledge of them is  sure
to be of the greatest help.

     But that is not all.   To understand the Physical World,  which is  the
world  of effects,  it is necessary to understand the super-physical  World,
which is the world of causes.   We see street cars in motion and we hear the
clicking  of telegraph instruments,  but the mysterious force  which  causes
phenomena remains invisible to us.   We say it is electricity,  but the name
gives us no explanation.   We learn nothing of the force itself;  we see and
hear only its effects.

     If  a dish of cold water be placed in an atmosphere of  a  sufficiently
low  temperature ice crystals immediately begin to form and we can  see  the
process  of their formation.   The lines along which the water  crystallizes
were in it all the time as lines of force but they were invisible until  the
water congealed.  The beautiful "frost flowers" on a windowpane  are visible



[PAGE 28]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

manifestations  of currents of the higher Worlds which operate upon  us  all
the time, unrecognized by most of us, but none the less potent.

     The higher Worlds are thus the worlds of causes, of forces; and we can-
not really understand this lower World unless we know the others and realize
the forces and causes of which all material things are but the effects.

     As  to  the reality of these higher Worlds compared with  that  of  the
Physical World,  strange as it may seem,  these higher Worlds,  which to the
majority appear as mirages, or even less substantial,  are,  in truth,  much
more  real and the objects in them more lasting and indestructible than  the
objects in the Physical World.   If we take an example we shall readily  see
this.   An architect does not start to build a house by procuring the  mate-
rial and setting the workmen to laying stone upon stone in a haphazard  way,
without  thought or plan.   He "thinks the house out."   Gradually it  takes
form in his mind and finally there stands a clear idea of the house that  is
to be--a thought-form of a house.

     This house is yet invisible to all but the architect.   He makes it ob-
jective on paper.   He draws the plans and from this objective image of  the
thought-form the workmen construct the house of wood,  iron,  or stone,  ac-
curately corresponding to the thought-form originated by the architect.

     Thus  the  thought-form becomes a material  reality.   The  materialist
would assert that it is much more real, lasting and substantial that the im-
age in the architect's mind.  But let us see.  The house could not have been
constructed without the thought-form.   The material object can be destroyed
by dynamite,  earthquake,  fire, or decay, but the thought-form will remain.
It  will  exist  as  long  as  the architect lives and from it any number of



[PAGE 29]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

houses similar to the one destroyed may be constructed.  Not even the archi-
tect himself can destroy it.   Even after his death this thought-form can be
recovered  by  those who are qualified to read the memory of  nature,  which
will be dealt with later.

     Having thus seen the reasonableness of such Worlds existing around  and
about us, and having satisfied ourselves of their reality, their permanency,
and of the utility of a knowledge concerning them, we shall now examine them
severally and singly, commencing with the Physical World.


               CHEMICAL REGION OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD

     In the Rosicrucian teaching the universe  is divided into seven differ-
ent Worlds, or states of matter, as follows:

                      1-World of God.
                      2-World of Virgin Spirits.
                      3-World of Divine Spirit.
                      4-World of Life Spirit.
                      5-World of Thought.
                      6-Desire World.
                      7-Physical World.

     The division is not arbitrary but necessary,  because the substance  of
each  of these Worlds is amenable to laws which are practically  inoperative
in others.   For instance, in the Physical World, matter is subject to grav-
ity,  contraction and expansion.   In the Desire World there is neither heat
nor cold, and forms levitate as easily as they gravitate.  Distance and time
are also governing factors of existence in the Physical World,  but are  al-
most non-existent in the Desire World.

     The matter of these worlds also varies in density,  the Physical  World
being the densest of the seven.

     Each World is subdivided into seven Regions or sub-divisions of matter.



[PAGE 30]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

In the Physical World,  the solids,  liquids and gases form the three denser
subdivisions,  the remaining four being ethers of varying densities.  In the
other Worlds similar subdivisions are necessary, because the matter of which
they are composed is not of uniform density.

     There are still two further distinctions to be made.   The three  dense
subdivisions of the Physical World--the solids,  liquids  and gases--consti-
tute what is termed the Chemical Region. The substance in this Region is the 
basis of all dense Form.

     The Ether is also physical matter.  It is not homogeneous,  as material
science alleges,  but exists in four different states.   It is the medium of
ingress for the quickening spirit which imparts VITALITY to the Forms in the
Chemical  Region.   The four finer or etheric subdivisions of  the  Physical
World constitute what is known as the Etheric Region.

     In the World of Thought the three higher subdivisions are the basis  of
abstract thought,  hence they,  collectively,  are called the Region of  Ab-
stract Thought.  The four denser subdivisions supply the mind-stuff in which
we embody and concrete our ideas and are therefore termed the Region of Con-
crete Thought.

     The careful consideration given by the occultist to the characteristics
of the Physical World might seem superfluous were it not that he regards all
things from a view point differing widely from that of the materialist.  The
latter recognizes three states of matter--solids, liquids, and gases.  These
are all chemical,  because derived from the chemical constituents of  Earth.
From this chemical matter all the FORMS of mineral, plant,  animal,  and man
have been built, hence they are as truly  chemical  as  the substances which




[PAGE 31]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

are commonly so termed.   Thus whether we consider the mountain or the cloud
that  envelops its top,  the juice of the plant or the blood of the  animal,
the spider's thread, the wing of the butterfly or the bones of the elephant,
the  air  we  breathe or the water we drink--all are  composed of  the  same
chemical substance.

     What  is it then which determines the conformation of this  basic  sub-
stance into the multiplex variety of Forms which we see about us?  It is the
One Universal Spirit,  expressing Itself in the visible world as four  great
streams of Life, at varying stages of development.   This fourfold spiritual
impulse molds the chemical matter of the Earth into variegated forms of  the
four Kingdoms--mineral, plant,  animal, and man.  When a form has served its
purpose as a vehicle of expression for the three higher streams of life, the
chemical forces disintegrate that form so that the matter may be returned to
its primordial state, and thus made available for the building of new forms.
The  spirit  or life which molds the form into an expression of  itself  is,
therefore,  as extraneous to the matter it uses as a carpenter is apart from
and personally independent of the house he builds for his own occupancy.

     As all the forms of mineral, plant, animal, and man are chemical,  they
must  logically  be as dead and devoid of feeling as chemical matter  in  it
primitive state, and the Rosicrucian asserts that they are.

     Some scientists contend that there is feeling in all tissue,  living or
dead,  to whatever kingdom it belongs.  They include even the substances or-
dinarily classed as mineral in their category of objects having feeling, and
to  prove their contentions they submit diagrams with curves of  energy  ob-
tained from tests.  Another  class of investigators teach   that there is no




[PAGE 32]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

feeling even in the human body,  except in the brain,  which is the SEAT  of
feeling.   They say it is the brain and not the finger which feels the  pain
when  the latter is injured.   Thus is the house of Science divided  against
itself  on  this as on most other points.   The position taken  by  each  is
partly right.  It depends upon what we mean by "feeling."  If we mean simply
response to impacts, such as the rebound of a rubber ball that is dropped to
the ground, of course it is correct to attribute feeling to mineral,  plant,
and animal tissue; but if we mean pleasure and pain, love and hate,  joy and
sorrow, it would be absurd to attribute them to the lower forms of life,  to
detached tissue,  to minerals in their native state,  or even to the  brain,
because such feelings are expressions of the self-conscious immortal spirit,
and  the brain is only the keyboard of the wonderful instrument  upon  which
the human spirit plays its symphony of life,  just as the musician expresses
himself upon his violin.

     As there are people who are quite unable to understand that there  must
be and are higher Worlds, so there are some who,  having become slightly ac-
quainted  with  the higher realms,  acquire the habit of  undervaluing  this
Physical World.   Such an attitude is as incorrect as that of the  material-
ist.   The  great and wise Beings who carry out the will and design  of  God
placed us in this physical environment to learn great and important  lessons
which could not be learned under other conditions, and it is our duty to use
our  knowledge of the higher Worlds in learning to the best of  our  ability
the lessons which this material world has to teach us.

     In one sense the Physical World is a sort of model school or experiment
station to teach us to work correctly in the others.   It does this  whether
or not we know of the existence of those other worlds,  thereby  proving the




[PAGE 33]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

great  wisdom of the originators of the plan.   If we had knowledge of  none
but the higher Worlds, we would make many mistakes which would become appar-
ent only when physical conditions are brought to bear as criterion.   To il-
lustrate:   Let us imagine the case of an inventor working out his idea of a
machine.  First he builds the machine in thought, and in his mind he sees it
complete  and in operation,  performing most beautifully the work it is  de-
signed to do.   He next makes a drawing of the design,  and in doing so per-
haps finds that modifications in his first conception are necessary.   When,
from  the drawings,  he has become satisfied that the plan is  feasible,  he
proceeds to build the actual machine from suitable material.

     Now it is almost certain that still further modifications will be found
necessary before the machine will work as intended.  It may be found that it
must  be entirely remodeled,  or even that it is altogether useless  in  its
present form, must be discarded and a new plan evolved.  But mark this,  for
here is the point:   the new idea or plan will be formulated for the purpose
of eliminating the defects in the useless machine.   Had there been no mate-
rial  machine constructed,  thereby making evident the faults of  the  first
idea, a second and correct idea would not have been formed.

     This applies equally to all conditions of life--social, mercantile, and
philanthropic.   Many plans appear excellent to those conceiving  them,  and
may  even look well on paper,  but when brought down in the actual  test  of
utility  they often fail.   That however, should not discourage us.   It  is
true that "we learn more from our mistakes than from our successes," and the
proper light in which to regard this Physical World is as a school of  valu-
able experience, in which we learn lessons of the utmost importance.






[PAGE 34]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION


                  THE ETHERIC REGION OF THE PHYSICAL WORLD.

     As  soon as we enter this realm of nature we are in the invisible,  in-
tangible World,  where our ordinary senses fail us,  hence this part of  the
Physical World is practically unexplored by material science.

     Air is invisible, yet modern science knows that it exists.  By means of
instruments its velocity as wind can be measured;  by compression it can  be
made visible as liquid air.  With either, however, that is not so easy.  Ma-
terial  science  finds that it is necessary to account in some way  for  the
transmission of electricity,  with or without wires.  It is forced to postu-
late  some substance of a finer kind that it knows,  and it calls that  sub-
stance "ether."  It does not really know that ether exists, as the ingenuity
of the scientist has not,  as yet,  been able to devise a vessel in which it
is  possible to confine this substance, which is altogether too elusive  for
the  comfort of the "wizard of the laboratory."   He cannot measure,  weigh,
nor analyze it by any apparatus now at his disposal.

     Truly,  the achievements of modern science are marvelous.  The best way
to  learn the secrets of nature, however,  is not by inventing  instruments,
but by improving the investigator himself.  Man has within himself faculties
which eliminate distance and compensate for lack of size to a degree as much
greater than the power of telescope and microscope as theirs exceeds that of
the  naked eye.   These senses or faculties are the means  of  investigation
used by occultists.  They are their "open sesame" in searching for truth.

     To the trained clairvoyant ether is as tangible as are the solids,  li-
quids, and gases of the Chemical Region to ordinary beings. He sees that the



[PAGE 35]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

vital forces which give life to the mineral forms of plant,  animal and  man
flow into these forms, by means of the four states of ether.   The names and
specific functions of these four ethers are as follows.

  (1) Chemical Ether--This ether is both positive and negative in manifesta-
tion.   The forces which cause assimilation and excretion work  through  it.
Assimilation is the process whereby the different nutritive elements of food
are incorporated into the body of plant, animal and man.  This is carried on
by forces with which we shall become acquainted later.   They work along the
positive pole of the chemical ether and attract the needed elements,  build-
ing them into the forms concerned.   These forces do not act blindly nor me-
chanically, but in a selective way (well-known to scientists by its effects)
thereby accomplishing their purpose,  which is the growth and maintenance of
the body.

     Excretion is carried on by forces of the same kind,  but working  along
the  negative pole of the chemical ether.  By means of this pole they  expel
from  the body the materials in the food which are unfit for use,  or  those
which  have outlived their usefulness in the body and should  be  expurgated
from the system.   This, like all other processes independent of man's voli-
tion,  is also wide,  selective, and not merely mechanical in its operation,
as seen, for instance, in the case of the action of the kidneys,  where only
the urine is filtered through when the organs are in health; but it is known
that when the organs are not in health,  the valuable albumen is allowed  to
escape with the urine, the proper selection not being made because of an ab-
normal condition.



[PAGE 36]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

     (2)  Life Ether--As the chemical ether is the avenue for the  operation
of the forces the object of which is the maintenance of the individual form,
so  the life ether is the avenue for the operation of the forces which  have
for their object the maintenance of the species--the forces of propagation.

     Like  the  chemical ether,  the life ether also has  its  positive  and
negative  pole.   The forces which work along the positive  pole  are  those
which  work  in  the female during gestation.   They enable her  to  do  the
positive,  active work of bringing forth a new being.  On the other hand the
forces which work along the negative pole of the life ether enable the  male
to produce semen.

     In the work on the impregnated ovum of the animal and man,  or upon the
seed  of the plant,  the forces working along the positive pole of the  life
ether produce male plants,  animals and men;  while the forces which express
themselves through the negative pole generate females.

      (3)  Light  Ether--This ether is both positive and negative,  and  the
forces which play along its positive pole are the forces which generate that
blood heat in the higher species of animal and in man,  which makes them in-
dividual sources of heat.   The forces which work along the negative pole of
the light ether are those which operate through the senses,  manifesting  as
the passive functions of sight, hearing,  feeling,  tasting,  and  smelling.
They also build and nourish the eye.

     In the cold-blooded animals the positive pole of the light ether is the
avenue of the forces which circulate the blood, and the negative forces have
the same functions in regard to the eye as in the case of the higher animals
and man.  Where eyes are lacking, the forces working in the negative pole of
the  light ether are perhaps building or nourishing other sense  organs,  as
they do in all that have sense organs.




[PAGE 37]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

     In  plants the forces which work along the positive pole of  the  light
ether  cause the circulation of the juices of the plant.   Thus  in  winter,
when  the  light ether is not charged with sunlight as in  summer,  the  sap
ceases  to flow until the summer sun again invests the light ether with  its
force.  The forces which work along the negative pole of the light ether de-
posit the chlorophyll,  the green substance of the plant and also color  the
flowers.   In fact,  all color, in all kingdoms is deposited by means of the
negative pole of the light ether.  Therefore animals have the deepest  color
on  the back and flowers are deepest colored on the side turned towards  the
light.   In the polar regions of the earth,  where the rays of the  sun  are
weak,  all color is lighter and in some cases is so sparingly deposited that
in winter it is withdrawn altogether and the animals become white.

     (4)   Reflecting Ether--It has heretofore been stated that the idea  of
the house which has existed in the mind can be recovered from the memory  of
nature,  even after the death of the architect.   Everything that  has  ever
happened  has  left  behind it an ineffaceable picture  in  this  reflecting
ether.   As  the giant ferns of the childhood of the Earth have  left  their
pictures  in the coal beds,  and as the progress of the glacier of a  bygone
day may be traced by means of the trail it has left upon the rocks along its
path,  even so are the thoughts and acts of men ineffaceably recorded by na-
ture in this reflecting ether,  where the trained seer may read their  story
with an accuracy commensurate with his ability.

     The  reflecting ether deserves its name for more than one  reason,  for
the pictures in it are but REFLECTIONS of the memory  of  nature.   The real



[PAGE 38]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

memory of nature is found in a much higher realm.   In this reflecting ether
no thoroughly trained clairvoyant cares to read, as the pictures are blurred
and  vague compared to those found in the higher realm.   Those who read  in
the reflecting ether are generally those who have no choice,  who,  in fact,
do  not know what they are reading.   As a rule ordinary psychometrists  and
mediums obtain their knowledge through the reflecting ether.  To some slight
extent  the pupil of the occult school in the first stages of  his  training
also reads in the reflecting ether,  but he is warned by his teacher of  his
insufficiencies of this ether as a means of acquiring accurate  information,
so that he does not easily draw wrong conclusions.

     This ether is also the medium through which thought makes an impression
upon the human brain.   It is most intimately connected with the fourth sub-
division of the World of Thought.   This is the highest of the four subdivi-
sions  contained in the Region of Concrete Thought and the homeworld of  the
human mind.   There a much clearer version of the memory of nature is  found
than in the reflecting ether.

                              THE DESIRE WORLD

     Like the Physical World,  and every other realm of nature,  the  Desire
World has the seven subdivisions called "Regions,"  but unlike the  Physical
World,  it does not have the great divisions corresponding to  the  Chemical
and Etheric Regions.   Desire stuff in the Desire World persists through its
seven subdivisions or regions as material for the embodiment of desire.   As
the  Chemical Region is the realm of form and as the Etheric Region  is  the
home of the forces carrying on life activities in those forms, enabling them




[PAGE 39]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

to live,  move and propagate, so the forces in the Desire World,  working in
the quickened dense body, impel it to move in this or that direction.

     If  there were only the activities of the Chemical and Etheric  Regions
of the Physical World, there would be forms having life,  able to move,  but
WITH  NO INCENTIVE FOR SO DOING.   This incentive is supplied by the  cosmic
forces active in the Desire World and without this activity playing  through
every fibre of the vitalized body,  urging action in this direction or that,
there would be no experience and no moral growth.  The functions of the dif-
ferent  ethers would take care of the growth of the form,  but moral  growth
would  entirely lacking.   Evolution would be an impossibility,  both as  to
form and life,  for it is only in response to the requirements of  spiritual
growth  that forms evolve to higher states.  Thus we at once see  the  great
importance of this realm of nature.

     Desires,  wishes, passions, and feelings express themselves in the mat-
ter of the different regions of the Desire World as form and feature express
themselves in the  Chemical Region of the Physical World.   They take  forms
which last for a longer or shorter time,  according to the intensity of  the
desire, wish, or feeling embodied in them.  In the Desire World the distinc-
tion between the forces and the matter is not so definite and apparent as in
the Physical World.   One might almost say that here the ideas of force  and
matter are identical or interchangeable.  It is not quite so, but we may say
that to a certain extent the Desire World consists of force-matter.

     When speaking of the matter of the Desire World,  it is true that it is
one degree less dense that the matter of the Physical World,  but we  enter-
tain an entirely wrong idea if we imaging it is finer physical matter.  That



[PAGE 40]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

idea,  though held by many who have studied occult philosophies, is entirely
erroneous.   The wrong impression is caused principally by the difficulty of
giving  the  full and accurate description necessary for a  thorough  under-
standing of the higher worlds.  Unfortunately,  our language is  descriptive
of material things and therefore entirely inadequate to describe the  condi-
tions  of  the super-physical realms,  hence all that is  said  about  these
realms must be taken tentatively,  as similes,  rather than as accurate  de-
scriptions.

     Though the mountain and the daisy, the man,  the horse,  and a piece of
iron,  are composed of one ultimate atomic substance, we do not say that the
daisy  is  a finer form of iron.  Similarly it is impossible to  explain  in
words the change or difference in physical matter when it is broken up  into
desire-stuff.   If there were no difference it would be amenable to the laws
of the Physical World, which it is not.

     The law of matter of the Chemical Region is inertia-the tendency to re-
main IN STATU QUO.  It  takes a certain amount of force to overcome this in-
ertia  and cause a body which is at rest to move,  or to stop a body in  mo-
tion.   Not so with the matter of the Desire World.   That matter itself  is
almost living.   It is in unceasing motion, fluid, taking all imaginable and
unimaginable  forms with inconceivable facility and rapidity,  at  the  same
time  coruscating  and scintillating in a thousand ever-changing  shades  of
color, incomparable to anything we know in this physical state of conscious-
ness.   Something very faintly resembling the action and appearance of  this
matter  will be seen in the play of colors on an abalone shell when held  in
the sunlight and moved to and fro.

   That is what the Desire World is--ever-changing light and color--in which
the  forces  of  animal  and  man intermingle with the forces of innumerable



[PAGE 41]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

Hierarchies  of spiritual beings which do not appear in our Physical  World,
but are as active in the Desire World as we are here.   Some of them will be
dealt with later and their connection with man's evolution described.

     The  forces  sent out by this vast and varied hose of Beings  mold  the
ever-changing  matter  of the Desire World into  innumerable  and  differing
forms of more or less durability, according to the kinetic energy of the im-
pulse which gave them birth.

     From  this slight description it may be understood how difficult it  is
for a neophyte who has just had his inner eyes opened to find his balance in
the World of Desire.   The trained clairvoyant soon ceases to wonder at  the
impossible descriptions sometimes brought through by mediums.   They may  be
perfectly honest,  but the possibilities of parallax,  and of getting out of
focus are legion,  and of the subtlest nature,  and the real wonder is  that
they ever communicate anything correctly.  All of us had to learn to see, in
the  days of our infancy,  as we may readily find by watching a young  babe.
It  will  be found that the little one will reach for objects on  the  other
side of the room or the street,  or for the Moon.   He is entirely unable to
gauge distances.  The blind man who has been made to see will, at first, of-
ten close his eyes to walk from one place to another,  declaring,  until  he
has  learned to use his eyes,  that it is easier to walk by feeling than  by
sight.   So the one whose inner organs of perception have been vivified must
also be trained in the use of his newly acquired faculty.  At first the neo-
phyte  will try to apply to the Desire World the knowledge derived from  his
experience in the Physical World, because he has not yet learned the laws of
the world into which he is entering.  This is the source of a vast amount of




[PAGE 42]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

trouble  and  perplexity.   Before he can understand,  he must become  as  a
little child,  which imbibed knowledge without reference to any previous ex-
perience.

     To  arrive at a correct understanding of the Desire World it is  neces-
sary  to  realize that it is the world of feeling,  desires,  and  emotions.
These  are  all under the domination of two great forces--Attraction and Re-
pulsion, which act in a different way in the three denser Regions of the De-
sire World  from that in which they act in the three finer or upper Regions, 
while the central Region may be called neutral ground.

     This central Region is the Region of feeling.   Here interest in or in-
difference to an object or an idea sways the balance in favor of one of  the
two  previously mentioned forces,  thereby relegating the object or idea  to
the  three  higher or the three lower Regions of the Desire World,  or  else
they will expel it.  We shall see presently how this is accomplished.

     In  the finest and rarest substance of the three higher Regions of  the
Desire  World  the  force of Attraction alone holds sway,  but  it  is  also
present  in  some degree in the denser matter of the  three  lower  Regions,
where it works against the force of Repulsion, which is dominant there.  The
disintegrating force of Repulsion would soon destroy every form coming  into
these three lower Regions were it not that it is thus counteracted.   In the
densest or lowest Region,  where it is strongest,  it tears and shatters the
forms  built  there in a way dreadful to see,  yet it is  not  a  fatalistic
force.   Nothing in nature is vandalistic.  All that appears so is but work-
ing towards good.  So  with  this  force in its work in the lowest Region of




[PAGE 43]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

the  Desire  World.   The forms here are demoniac creations,  built  by  the
coarsest passions and desires of man and beast.

     The tendency of every form in the Desire World is to attract itself all
it  can of a like nature and grow thereby.   If this tendency to  attraction
were predominate in the lowest Regions, evil would grow like a weed.   There
would be anarchy instead of order in the Cosmos.  This prevented by the pre-
ponderating power of the force of Repulsion in this Region.   When a  coarse
desire  form is being attracted to another of the same nature,  there  is  a
disharmony in their vibrations, whereby one has a disintegrating effect upon
the other.   Thus, instead of uniting and amalgamating evil with evil,  they
act  with  mutual destructiveness and in that way the evil in the  world  is
kept within reasonable bounds.   When we understand the working of the  twin
forces in this respect we are in a position to understand the occult  maxim,
"A lie is both murder and suicide in the Desire World."

     Anything happening in the Physical World is reflected in all the  other
realms of nature and,  as we have seen,  builds its appropriate form in  the
Desire World.  When a true account of the occurrence is given,  another form
is  built,  exactly  like  the first.  They  are  then  drawn  together  and
coalesce, strengthening each other.  If, however, an untrue is given, a form
different from and antagonistic to the first, or true one,  is created.   As
they deal with the same occurrence,  they are drawn together,  but as  their
vibrations  are different they act upon each other with mutual  destructive-
ness.  Therefore, evil and malicious lies can kill anything that is good, if
they are strong enough and repeated often enough.  But, conversely,  seeking
for the good in evil will,  in time,  transmute the evil into good.   If the
form that is built to minimize the evil is weak, it will have no effect  and





[PAGE 44]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

will be destroyed by the evil form,  but if it is strong and frequently  re-
peated  it will have the effect of disintegrating the evil and  substituting
the good.  That effect, be it distinctly understood, it not brought about by
lying, nor denying the evil, but by looking for the good.  The occult scien-
tist  practices  very  rigidly this principle of looking  for  good  in  all
things, because he knows what a power it possesses in keeping down evil.

     There  is  a story of Christ which illustrates this point.   Once  when
walking with His disciples they passed the decaying and ill-smelling carcass
of a dog.   The disciples turned in disgust,  commenting upon the nauseating
nature  of this sight;  but Christ looked at the dead body and said  "Pearls
are not whiter than its teeth."  He was determined to find the good, because
He  knew the beneficial effect which would result in the Desire  World  from
giving it expression.

     The lowest Region of the Desire World is called "the Region of  Passion
and Sensual Desire."   The second subdivision is best described by the  name
of "Region of Impressionability."  Here the effect of the twin forces of At-
traction and Repulsion is evenly balanced.  This is a neutral Region,  hence
all  our impressions which are built of the matter of this Region  are  neu-
tral.   Only when the twin feelings,  which we shall meet in the fourth  Re-
gion,  are brought to bear, do the twin forces come into play.  The mere im-
pression of anything,  however, in and of itself,  is entirely separate from
the feeling it engenders.   The impression is neutral and is an activity  of
the  second  Region of the Desire World,  where pictures are formed  by  the
forces of sense-perception in the vital body of man.

     In the third Region of the Desire World,  the force of Attraction,  the
integrating, upbuilding force, has already gained the upper  hand  over  the




[PAGE 45]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

force of Repulsion,  with its destructive tendency.  When we understand that
the mainspring in this force of Repulsion is self-assertion,  a pushing away
of all others that it may have room,  we shall understand that it gives  way
most easily to a desire for other things, so that the substance of the third
Region of the Desire World is principally dominated by the force of  Attrac-
tion towards other things,  but in a selfish way,  and therefore this is the
Region of Wishes.

     The  Region  of  Coarse Desires may be likened to  the  solids  in  the
Physical World; the Region of Impressionability to the fluids; and the fluc-
tuating,  evanescent nature of the Region of Wishes will make  that  compare
with  the gaseous portion of the Physical World.   These three Regions  give
the  substance  for  the forms which make for  experience,  soul-growth  and
evolution,  purging the altogether destructive and retaining  the  materials
which may be used for progress.

     The fourth Region of the Desire World is the "Region of Feeling."  From
it  comes  the feeling concerning the already described forms and  upon  the
feeling engendered by them depends the life which they have for us and  also
their effect upon us.   Whether the objects and ideas presented are good  or
bad in themselves is not important this stage.   It is our feeling,  whether
of Interest or Indifference that is the determining factor as to the fate of
the object or idea.

     If the feeling with which we meet an impression of an object or an idea
is Interest, it has the same effect upon that impression as sunlight and air
have upon a plant.  That idea will grow and flourish in our lives.   If,  on
the other hand, we meet an impression or idea with Indifference,  it withers
as does a plant when put in a dark cellar.




[PAGE 46]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

     Thus from this central Region of the Desire World come the incentive to
action,  or the decision to refrain therefrom (though the latter is also ac-
tion in the eyes of the occult scientist),  for at the present stage of  our
development the twin feelings,  Interest and Indifference furnish the incen-
tive  to action and are the springs that move the world.   At a later  stage
these feelings will cease to have any weight.   Then the determining  factor
will be DUTY.

     Interest starts the forces of Attraction or Repulsion.

     Indifference simply withers the object or idea against which it is  di-
rected, so far as our connection with it is concerned.

     If  our  interest  in an object or an idea  generates  Repulsion,  that
naturally causes us to expurgate from our lives any connection with the  ob-
ject  or idea which roused it;  but there is a great difference between  the
action of the force of Repulsion and the mere feeling of Indifference.  Per-
haps an illustration will make more clear the operation of the twin Feelings
and the twin Forces.

     Three men are walking along a road.  They see a sick dog; it is covered
with sores and is evidently suffering intensely from pain and thirst.   This
much is evident to all three men-their senses tell them that.   Now  Feeling
comes.  Two of them take an "interest" in the animal, but in the third there
is a feeling of "indifference."   He passes on, leaving the dog to its fate.
The  others remain;  they are both interested,  but each manifests it  in  a
quite  different way.   The interest of one man is sympathetic and  helpful,
impelling him to care for the poor beast, to assuage pains and nurse it back
to health.   In him the feeling of interest has aroused the force of Attrac-
tion.  The  other  man's  interest  is  of a different kind.  He sees only a




[PAGE 47]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

loathsome sight which is revolting to him and wishes to rid himself and  the
world of it as quickly as possible.   He advises killing the animal outright
and  burying it.   In him the feeling of interest generates the  destructive
force of Repulsion.

     When the feeling of Interest arouses the force of Attraction and it  is
directed  toward low objects and desires, these work themselves out  in  the
lower  Regions of the Desire World, where the counteracting force of  Repul-
sion  operates,  as  previously described.   From the  battle  of  the  twin
forces--Attraction and Repulsion--results all the pain and  suffering  inci-
dent to wrongdoing or misdirected effort, whether intentional or otherwise.

     Thus we may see how very important Feeling we have concerning anything,
for upon that depends the nature of the atmosphere we create for  ourselves.
If we love the good,  we shall keep and nourish as guardian angels all  that
is good about us;  if the reverse,  we shall people our path with demons and
our own breeding.

     The names of the three upper Regions of the Desire World are "Region of
Soul-Life,"  "Region of Soul-Light,"  and "Region of Soul-Power."   In these
abide  Art,  Altruism,  Philanthropy,  and all the activities of the  higher
soul-life.   When  we  think of these Regions  as  radiating  the  qualities
indicated  by  their names,  into the forms of the three lower  Regions,  we
shall  understand  correctly the higher and lower  activities.   Soul-power,
however,  may for a time be used for evil purposes as well as for good,  but
eventually the force of Repulsion destroys vice and the force of  Attraction
builds virtue upon its shattered ruins.  All things,  in the ultimate,  work
together for GOOD.

     The Physical and the Desire Worlds are not separated from each other by




[PAGE 48]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

space.   They are "closer than hands and feet."  It is not necessary to move
to get from one to the other, nor from one Region to the next.  Just as sol-
ids,  liquids,  and gases are all together in our bodies,  inter-penetrating
one  another,  so are the different Regions of the Desire  World  within  us
also.  We may again compare the lines of force along which ice-crystals form
in water to the invisible causes originating in the Desire World,  which ap-
pear in the Physical World and give us the incentive to action,  in whatever
direction it may be.

     The  Desire  World,  with it  innumerable  inhabitants,  permeates  the
Physical  World,  as  the lines of force do the water--invisible, but every-
where present and potent as the cause of everything in the Physical World.

                            THE WORLD OF THOUGHT

     The  World  of  Thought  also consists  of  seven  Regions  of  varying
qualities and densities,  and, like the Physical World, the World of Thought
is divided into two main divisions--the Region of Concrete Thought, compris-
ing the four densest Regions; and the Region of Abstract Thought, comprising
the three Regions of finest substance.  This World of Thought is the central
one of the five Worlds from which man obtains his vehicles.  Here spirit and
body meet.  It is also the highest of the three Worlds in which man's evolu-
tion is being carried forward at the present time, the two higher Worlds be-
ing practically in abeyance as yet, so far as man is concerned.

     We know that the materials of the Chemical Region are used in  building
all physical forms.   These are forms are given life and the power of motion
by the forces at work in the Etheric Region,  and some of these living forms
are stirred into activity by means of the twin Feelings of the Desire World.




[PAGE 49]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

The Region of Concrete Thought furnishes the mind-stuff in which ideas  gen-
erated in the Region of Abstract Thought clothe themselves as THOUGHT-FORMS,
to act as regulators and balance wheels upon the impulses engendered in  the
Desire World by impacts from the phenomenal World.

     Thus we see how the three Worlds, in which man is at present  evolving,
complement one another,  making a whole that shows forth the Supreme  Wisdom
of the Great Architect of the system to which we belong,  and Whom we rever-
ence by the holy name of God.

     Taking  a more detailed view of the several divisions of the Region  of
Concrete  Thought we find that the archetypes of PHYSICAL form no matter  to
what kingdom they may belong,  are found in its lowest subdivision,  or  the
"Continental Region."  In this Continental Region are also the archetypes of
the continents and the isles of the world, and corresponding to these arche-
types  are  they fashioned.   Modifications in the crust of the  Earth  must
first be wrought in the Continental Region.   Not until the archetypal model
has been changed can the Intelligences which we (to hide our ignorance  con-
cerning them) call the "Laws of Nature," bring about the physical conditions
which  alter the physical features of the Earth according to  the  modifica-
tions designed by the Hierarchies in charge of evolution.  They plan changes
as an architect plants the alteration of a building before the workmen  five
it concrete expression.   In like manner are changes in the FLORA and  FAUNA
due to metamorphoses in their respective archetypes.

     When we speak of the archetypes of all the different forms in the dense
world it must not be thought that these archetypes are merely models in  the
same sense in which we speak of an object constructed  in  miniature,  or in




[PAGE 50]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

some  material  other than that appropriate for its proper  and  final  use.
They are not merely likenesses nor models of the forms we see about us,  but
are  CREATIVE archetypes;  that is,  they fashion the forms of the  Physical
World in their own likeness or likenesses,  for often many work together  to
form one certain species,  each archetype giving part of itself to build the
required form

     The second subdivision of the Region of Concrete Thought is called  the
"Oceanic Region."  It is best described as flowing, pulsating vitality.  All
the  forces that work through the four ethers which constitute  the  Etheric
Region are there seen as archetypes.   It is a stream of flowing life,  pul-
sating through all forms, as blood pulsates through the body,  the same life
in  all forms.   Here the trained clairvoyant sees how true it is that  "all
life is one."

     The  "Aerial Region"  is the third division of the Region  of  Concrete
Thought.  Here we find the archetype of desires, passions, wishes, feelings,
and  emotions such as we experience in the Desire World.   Here all the  ac-
tivities  of  the Desire World appear as atmospheric conditions.   Like  the
kiss of summer breeze come the feelings of pleasure and joy to the clairvoy-
ant sense;  as the sighing of the wind in the tree-tops seem the longings of
the  soul and like flashes of lighting the passions of warring nations.   In
this  atmosphere of the Region of Concrete Thought are also pictures of  the
emotions of man and beast.

     The "Region of Archetypal Forces"  is the fourth division of the Region
of  Concrete Thought.   It is the central and most important region  in  the
five Worlds wherein man's entire evolution is carried on.   On the one  side
of  this  Region are the three higher Regions of the World of  Thought,  the
World of Life Spirit and the World of Divine Spirit.  On  the  other side of




[PAGE 51]                                   THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS

this Region of Archetypal Forces are the three lower Regions of the World of
Thought,  the Desire and the Physical Worlds.   Thus this Region  becomes  a
sort of "crux," bounded on one side by the Realms of Spirit, on the other by
the Worlds of Form.  It is a focusing point, where Spirit reflects itself in
matter.

     As the name implies,  this Region is the home of the Archetypal  Forces
which  direct  the  activity of the archetypes in  the  Region  of  Concrete
Thought.   From  this Region Spirit works on matter in a  formative  manner.
Diagram  1 shows the idea in a schematic way,  the forms in the lower  World
being  reflections of the Spirit in the higher Worlds.   The  fifth  Region,
which is the one nearest to the focusing point on the Spirit side,  reflects
itself in the third Region,  which is nearest the focusing point on the Form
side.   The sixth Region reflects itself in the second and the  seventh  re-
flects itself in the first.

     The  whole of the Region of Abstract thought is reflected in the  World
of  Desire;  the World of Life Spirit in the Etheric Region of the  Physical
World; and the World of Divine Spirit in the Chemical Region of the Physical
World.

     Diagram 2 will give a comprehensive idea of the seven Worlds which  are
the sphere of our development, but we must carefully keep in mind that these
Worlds  are  not placed one above another,  as shown in the  diagram.   They
inter-penetrate--that  is to say,  that as in the case where the relation of
the Physical World and the Desire World was compared,  where we likened  the
Desire  World to the lines for force in freezing water and the water  itself
to the Physical World, in the same way we may think of the lines of force as

being any of the seven Worlds, and the water,  as in our illustration, would 
correspond to the next denser World in the scale.   Another illustration may 
perhaps make the subject clearer.

     Let  us  use  a spherical sponge to represent  the   dense   earth--the
Chemical Region.   Imagine that sand permeates every part of the sponge  and
also forms a layer outside the sponge.   Let the sand represent the  Etheric
Region,  which in a similar manner permeates the dense earth and extends be-
yond its atmosphere.

     Let  us  further imagine this sponge and sand immersed in  a  spherical
glass  vessel filled with clear water,  and a little larger than the  sponge
and sand.   We place the sponge and sand in the center of the vessel as  the
yolk is place in the center of an egg.   We have now a space of clear  water
between  the sand and the vessel.   The water as a whole will represent  the
Desire World,  for just as the water percolates between the grains of  sand,
through very pore of the sponge,  and forms that clear layer,  so the Desire
World  permeates both the dense Earth and the ether and extends beyond  both
of these substances.

     We know there is air in water,  and if we think of the air in the water
(in our illustration), as representing the World of Thought, we shall have a
fir mental picture of the way in which the World of Thought, being finer and
more subtle, inter-penetrates the two denser Worlds.

     Finally,  imagine that the vessel containing the sponge, sand and water
is  placed in the center of a large spherical vessel;  then the air  in  the
space  between  the two vessels would represent that part of  the  World  of
Thought which extends  beyond the Desire World.

     Each   of   the   planets  in  our  solar   system   has   three   such
inter-penetrating Worlds,  and if we think of each of the planets consisting

of three Worlds as being individual  sponges,  and  of the fourth World, the 
World of Life Spirit, as being the water in a large vessel where these three 
fold separate sponges swim,  we shall understand  that  as  the water in the 
vessel fills  the  space  between  the sponges  and percolates through them,
so the World  of Life Spirit  pervades inter-planetary space and inter-pene-
trates the individual planets.  It forms a common bond between them, so that 
as it  is  necessary to have a boat and be able to control it, if we wish to 
sail from America to Africa, so it is necessary  to have a vehicle correlat-
ed  to the World of Life Spirit  under  our conscious control in order to be 
able to travel from one planet to another.

     In  a manner similar to that in which the World of Life  Spirit  corre-
lates us to the other planets in our own solar system does the World  Divine
Spirit  correlate us to the other solar systems.   We may regard  the  solar
systems as separate sponges, swimming in a World of Divine Spirit,  and thus
it will be apparent that in order to travel from one solar system to another
it would be necessary to be able to function consciously in the highest  ve-
hicle of man, the Divine Spirit.

                                CHAPTER II.

                             THE FOUR KINGDOMS.

     The  three Worlds of our planet are at present the field  of  evolution
for  a number of different kingdoms of life,  at various stages of  develop-
ment.   Only four of these need concern us at present,  viz.:   the mineral,
plant, animal, and human kingdoms.

     These four kingdoms are related to the three Worlds in different  ways,
according  to  the progress these groups of evolving life have made  in  the
school of experience.   So far as form is concerned the dense bodies of  all
the  kingdoms are composed of the same chemical substances-the solids,  liq-
uids, and gases of the Chemical Region.  The dense body of a man is as truly
a chemical compound as is the stone, although the latter is ensouled by min-
eral life only.  But even when speaking from the purely physical standpoint,
and laying aside all other considerations for the time being, there are sev-
eral important differences when we compare the dense body of the human being
with  the  mineral  of  the Earth.  Man moves,  grows,  and  propagates  his
species--the mineral, in its native state, does none of these things.

     Comparing  man with the forms of the plant kingdom,  we find that  both
plant and man have a dense body, capable of growth and propagation.  But Man
has  faculties not possessed by the plant.  He feels,  has the power of  mo-
tion, and the faculty of perceiving things exterior to himself.




[PAGE 57]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

     When  we compare man with the animal with the animal we see  that  both
have   the  faculties  of  feeling,   motion,   growth,   propagation,   and
sense-perception.   In addition,  man has the faculty of speech,  a superior
structure of the brain, and also hands--which are a very great physical  ad-
vantage.   We may note especially the development of the thumb,  which makes
the hand much more valuable than even that of the anthropoid.   Man has also
evolved  a definite language in which to express his feelings and  thoughts,
all of which places the dense body of the human being in a class by  itself,
beyond the three lower kingdoms.

     To account for these differences in the four kingdoms we must go to the
invisible Worlds,  and seek the causes which give one kingdom that which  is
denied to another.

     To function in any world, and express the qualities peculiar to it,  we
must first possess a vehicle made of its material.   In order to function in
the  dense Physical World it is necessary to have a dense body,  adapted  to
our  environment.   Otherwise  we should be ghosts,  as  they  are  commonly
called,  and be invisible to most physical beings.   So we must have a vital
body  before we can express life, grow,  or externalize the other  qualities
peculiar to the Etheric Region.

     To show feeling and emotion it is necessary to have a vehicle  composed
of the materials of the Desire World,  and a mind formed of the substance of
the Region of Concrete Thought is necessary to render thinking possible.

     When we examine the four kingdoms in relation to the Etheric Region, we
find that the mineral does not possess a separate vital body, and at once we
see the reason why it cannot grow, propagate, or show sentient life.

     As  an hypothesis necessary to account for other known facts,  material
science  holds  that  in  the densest solid,  as  in  the  rarest  and  most




[PAGE 58]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

attenuated gas,  no two atoms touch each other; that there is an envelope of
ether around each atom;  that the atoms in the universe float in an ocean of
ether.

     The  occult scientist knows this to be true of the Chemical Region  and
that the mineral does not possess a separate vital body of ether.  And as it
is  the planetary ether alone which envelops the atoms of the mineral,  that
makes the difference described.  It is necessary, as we have shown,  to have
a separate,  vital BODY,  desire BODY,  etc.,  to express the qualities of a
particular realm,  because the atoms of the World of Desire, of the World of
Thought and even of the Higher Worlds,  inter-penetrate the Mineral as  well
as  the  dense human body,  and if the inter-penetration  of  the  planetary
ether,  which  is  the ether that envelops the atoms of  the  mineral,  were
enough to make it feel and propagate its inter-penetration by the  planetary
World of Thought would also be sufficient to make it think.   This it cannot
do,  because it lacks a SEPARATE vehicle.  It is penetrated by the planetary
ether only,  and is therefore incapable of individual growth.  Only the low-
est of the four states of ether--the chemical--is active in the mineral. The
chemical forces in minerals are due to that fact.

     When we consider plant,  animal, and man in relation to the Etheric Re-
gion we note that each has a separate, vital body, in addition to being pen-
etrated by the planetary ether which forms the Etheric Region.   There is  a
difference,  however,  between the vital bodies of the plants and the  vital
bodies of animal and man.   In the vital body of the plant only the chemical
and the life ethers are fully active.   Hence the plant can grow by the  ac-
tion of the chemical ether and propagate its species through the activity of
the life ether of the separate,  vital body which it  possesses.   The light




[PAGE 59]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

ether is present, but is partially latent or dormant and reflecting ether is
lacking.  Therefore it is evident that the faculties of sense-perception and
memory,  which are the qualities of these ethers, cannot be expressed by the
plant kingdom.

     Turning  our attention to the vital body of the animal we find that  in
it the chemical,  life and light ethers are dynamically active.   Hence  the
animal  has  the faculties of assimilation and growth,  caused  by  the  ac-
tivities of the chemical ether;  and the faculty of propagation by means  of
the life ether--these being the same as in plants.  But in addition,  it has
the  faculties  of generating internal heat and  of  sense-perception.   The
fourth ether,  however,  is inactive in the animal,  hence it has no thought
nor memory.   That which appears as such will be shown later to be of a dif-
ferent nature.

     When  we analyze the human being,  we find that in him all four  ethers
are dynamically active in the highly organized vital body.   By means of the
activities  of the chemical he is able to assimilate food and to  grow;  the
forces  at work in the life ether enable him to propagate his  species;  the
forces in the light ether supply the dense body with heat,  work on the ner-
vous  system and muscles,  thus opening the doors of communication with  the
outside  world by way of the senses;  and the reflecting ether  enables  the
spirit to control its vehicle by means of thought.   This ether also  stores
past experience as memory.

     The vital body of plant, animal, and man,  extends beyond the periphery
of  the  dense  body as the Etheric Region,  which is the vital  body  of  a
planet,  extends beyond its dense part,  showing again the truth of the Her-
metic axiom "As above, so below."   The  distance  of  this extension of the




[PAGE 60]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

vital  body of man is about an inch and a half.   The part which is  outside
the  dense  body  is  very  luminous and about  the  color  of  a  new-blown
peach-blossom.   It is often seen by persons having very slight  involuntary
clairvoyance.   The writer has found, when speaking with such persons,  that
they frequently are not aware they see anything unusual and do not know what
they see.

     The  dense  body  is built into the matrix of this  vital  body  during
ante-natal life,  and with one exception, it is an exact copy,  molecule for
molecule,  of the vital body.   As the lines of force in freezing water  are
the avenues of formation for ice crystals,  so the lines of force in the vi-
tal body determine the shape of the dense body.   All through life the vital
body  is the builder and restorer of the dense form.   Were it not  for  the
etheric heart the dense heart would break quickly under the constant  strain
we put upon it.  All the abuses to which we subject the dense body are coun-
teracted,  so  far as lies in it power,  by the vital body,  which  is  con-
tinually fighting against the death of the sense body.

     The exception mentioned above is that the vital body of a man is female
or  negative,  while that of a woman is male or positive.   In that fact  we
have the key to numerous puzzling problems of life.  That woman gives way to
her emotions is due to the polarity noted, for her positive, vital body gen-
erates an excess of blood and causes her to labor under an enormous internal
pressure that would break the physical casement were not a safety-valve pro-
vided  in the periodical flow,  and another in the tears which  relieve  the
pressure on special occasions--for tears are "white bleeding."

     Man  may have and has as strong emotions as woman,  but he  is  usually
able to   suppress them without tears,  because his negative vital body does
not generate more blood than he can comfortably control.

     Unlike  the higher vehicles of humanity,  the vital body (except  under
certain circumstances,  to be explained when the subject of "Initiation"  is
dealt with) does not ordinarily leave the dense body until the death of  the
latter.   Then the chemical forces of the dense body are no longer  held  in
check  by  the evolving life.   They proceed to restore the  matter  to  its
primordial  condition by disintegration so that it may be available for  the
formation of other forms in the economy of nature.   Disintegration is  thus
due to the activity of the planetary forces in the chemical ether.

     In texture the vital body may be crudely compared to one of those  pic-
ture  frames made of hundreds of little pieces of wood which  interlock  and
present  innumerable points to the observer.   These points enter  into  the
hollow centers of the dense atoms,  imbuing them with vital force that  sets
them vibrating at a higher rate than that of the mineral of the earth  which
is not thus accelerated and ensouled.

     When a person is drowning, or falling from a height,  or freezing,  the
vital body leaves the dense body,  the atoms of which become temporarily in-
ert in consequence, but at resuscitation it re-enters the dense body and the
"points"  are again inserted in the dense atoms.   The inertia of the  atoms
causes  them to resist the resumption of vibration and that is the cause  of
the intense prickly pain and the tingling sensation noted at such times, but
not ordinarily, for the same reason that we become conscious of the starting
or stopping of a clock, but are oblivious to its tick when it is running.

     There  are  certain  cases where the vital body partly leaves the dense



[PAGE 62]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

body, such as when a hand "goes to sleep."  Then the etheric hand of the vi-
tal body ay be seen hanging below the dense arm like a glove and the  points
cause  the peculiar pricking sensation felt when the etheric hand  re-enters
the  dense hand.   Sometimes in hypnosis the head of the vital body  divides
and  hangs  outside the dense head,  one half over each  shoulder,  or  lies
around the neck like the collar of a sweater.  The absence of prickly sensa-
tion at awakening in cases like this is because during the hypnosis part  of
the hypnotist's vital body had been substituted for that of the victim.

     When anesthetics are used the vital body is partially driven out, along
with the higher vehicles,  and if the application is too strong and the life
ether  is driven out,  death ensues.   This same phenomenon may also be  ob-
served in the case of materializing mediums.  In fact the difference between
a  materializing medium and an ordinary man or woman is just this:   In  the
ordinary man or woman the vital body and the dense body are,  at the present
stage of evolution,  quite firmly interlocked, while in the medium they  are
loosely connected.   It has not always been so, and the time will come again
when  the vital body may normally leave the dense vehicle,  but that is  not
normally  accomplished at present.   When a medium allows his or  her  vital
body  to be used by entities from the Desire World who wish to  materialize,
the vital body generally oozes from the left side--through the spleen, which
is its particular "gate."   Then the vital forces cannot flow into the  body
as they do normally, the medium becomes greatly exhausted,  and some of them
resort to stimulants to counteract the effects,  in time becoming  incurable
drunkards.

     The vital force from the sun,  which surrounds us as a colorless fluid,
is absorbed by the vital body through the etheric counterpart of the spleen,




[PAGE 63]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

wherein  in undergoes a curious transformation of color.   It  becomes  pale
rosehued and spreads along the nerves all over the dense body.  It is to the
nervous  system  what  the force of electricity is to  a  telegraph  system.
Thought there be wires,  instruments,  and telegraph operators all in order,
if the electricity is lacking, no message can be sent.  The Ego,  the brain,
and the nervous system may be in seemingly perfect order,  but if the  vital
force  be lacking to carry the message of the Ego through the nerves to  the
muscles,  the dense body will remain inert.   This is exactly  what  happens
when  part of the dense body becomes paralyzed.   The vital body has  become
diseased and the vital force can no longer flow.  In such cases,  as in most
sickness, the trouble is with the finer invisible vehicles.  In conscious or
unconscious  recognition  of this fact, the most successful  physicians  use
suggestion--which  works upon the higher vehicles--as aid to  medicine.  The
more  a physician can imbue his patient with faith and  hope,  the  speedier
disease will vanish and give place to perfect health.

     During the health the vital body specializes a superabundance of  vital
force,which,  after passing through a dense body, radiates in straight lines
in  every direction from the periphery thereof, as the radii of a circle  do
from  the  center;  but during ill-health, when the vital body  becomes  at-
tenuated,  it is not able to draw to itself the same amount of force and  in
addition  the dense body is feeding upon it.   Then the lines of  the  vital
fluid which pass out from the body are crumpled and bent,  showing the  lack
of force behind them.  In health the great force of these radiations carries
with  it  germs and microbes which are inimical to the health of  the  dense
body, but in sickness, when the vital force is weak, these emanations do not




[PAGE 64]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

so  readily  eliminate disease germs.  Therefore the danger  of  contracting
disease  is much greater when the vital forces are low than when one  is  in
robust health.

     In  cases where parts of the dense body are amputated,  only the  plan-
etary ether accompanies the separated part.  The separate vital body and the
dense  body  disintegrate synchronously after death.   So with  the  etheric
counterpart  of the amputated limb.   It will gradually disintegrate as  the
dense  member decays,  but in the meantime the fact that the man still  pos-
sesses the etheric limb accounts for his assertion that he can feel his fin-
gers or suffers pain in them.  There is also a connection with a buried mem-
ber,  irrespective of distance.  A case is on record where a man felt severe
paid, as if a nail had been driven into the flesh of an amputated limb,  and
he persisted until the limb was exhumed,  when it was found that a nail  had
been driven into it at the time it was boxed for burial.   The nail was  re-
moved and the pain instantly stopped.   It is also in accordance with  these
facts that people complain of pain in a limb for perhaps two or three  years
after the amputation.   The pain will then cease.   This is because the dis-
ease remains in the still undetached etheric limb, but as the amputated part
disintegrates, the etheric limb follows suit and thus the pain ceases.

     Having  noted the relations of the four kingdoms to the Etheric  Region
of the Physical World,  we will next turn our attention to their relation to
the Desire World.

     Here  we  find that both minerals and plants lack the  separate  desire
body.   They  are permeated only by the planetary desire  body,  the  Desire
World.  Lacking the separate vehicle, they are incapable of feeling, desire,
and emotion, which  are  faculties   pertaining   to   the   Desire   World.





[PAGE 65]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

When  a stone is broken,  it does not feel;  but it would be wrong to  infer
that there is no feeling connected with such an action.  That is the materi-
alistic view,  or the view taken by the uncomprehending multitude.   The oc-
cult scientist knows that there is no act, great or small, which is not felt
throughout  the  universe,  and even though the stone,  because  it  has  no
separate desire body,  cannot feel, the Spirit of the Earth feels because it
is Earth's desire body that permeates the stone.   When a man cuts his  fin-
ger, the finger, having no separate desire body, does not feel the paid, but
the man does, because it is his desire body which permeates the finger.   If
a plant is torn up by the roots,  it is felt by the Spirit of the Earth as a
man would feel if a hair were torn from his head.   This Earth is a  living,
feeling  body,  and all the forms which are without separate  desire  bodies
through which their informing spirits may experience feeling,  are  included
in  the  desire  body of the Earth and THAT desire body  has  feeling.   The
breaking of a stone and the breaking off of flowers are productive of  plea-
sure to the Earth,  while the pulling our of plants by the root causes paid.
The  reason is given in the latter part of this work,  for at this stage  of
our study the explanation would be incomprehensible to the general reader.

     The planetary Desire World pulsates through the dense and vital  bodies
of animal and man in the same way that it penetrates the mineral and  plant,
but in addition to this,  animal and man have separate desire bodies,  which
enable  them to feel desire,  emotion and passion.   There is a  difference,
however.  The desire body of the animal is built entirely of the material of
the denser regions of the Desire World, while in the case of even the lowest
of  human  races  a  little  matter  of  the  higher Regions enters into the




[PAGE 66]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

composition of the desire body.   The feelings of animals and the lowest hu-
man races are almost entirely concerned with the gratification of the lowest
desires and passions which find their expression in the matter of the  lower
Regions of the Desire World.   Hence,  in order that they may have such emo-
tions to educate them for something higher, it is necessary that they should
have the corresponding materials in their desire bodies.   As man progresses
in  the school of life,  his experiences teach him,  and his desires  become
purer and better.  Thus by degrees the material of his desire body undergoes
a corresponding change.   The purer and brighter material of the higher  Re-
gions of the Desire World replaces the murky colors of the lower part.   The
desire  body also grows in size,  so that in a saint it is truly a  glorious
object to behold, the purity of its colors and its luminous transparency be-
ing beyond adequate simile.  It must be seen to be appreciated.

     At present the materials of both the lower and the higher Regions enter
into the composition of the desire bodies of the great majority of  mankind.
None  are so bad that they have not some good trait.   This is expressed  in
the  materials of the higher Regions which we find in their  desire  bodies.
But, on the other hand, very, very few are so good that they do not use some
of the materials of the lower Regions.

     In   the  same  way  that  the  planetary  vital  and   desire   bodies
inter-penetrate the dense material of the Earth,  as we saw in the illustra-
tion of the sponge,  the sand and the water,  so the vital and desire bodies
inter-penetrate the dense body of plant, animal,  and man.   But during  the
life  of man his desire body is not shaped like his dense and vital  bodies.
After death it assumes that shape.   During life it has the appearance of  a

luminous ovoid which, in waking hours,  completely surrounds the dense body,
as the albumen does the yolk of an egg.   It  extends from twelve to sixteen
inches beyond the  dense body.   In  this  desire body there are a number of
sense centers, but, in the great  majority of people,  they are latent.   It
is the awakening of  these centers  of  perception  that  corresponds to the
opening of the  blind  man's eyes in  our  former illustration.   The matter
in the human desire body is in incessant  motion  of  inconceivable rapidity.
There is in it no settled place for any particle, as in the dense body.  The
matter  that  is  at  the head one moment may be at the feet in the next and 
back again.   There are no  organs in the desire body, as in  the  dense and
vital bodies,  but there are centers of perception,  which, when active, ap-
pear as vortices,  always remaining in the same  relative  position  to  the
dense body, most of them about the  head. In the majority of people they are
mere eddies and are of no use as  centers of perception.   They may be awak-
ened in all, however, but different methods produce different results.

     In  the  involuntary  clairvoyant developed  along  improper,  negative
lines,  these vortices turn from right to left, or in the opposite direction
to the hands of a clock--counterclockwise.

     In the desire body of the properly trained voluntary clairvoyant,  they
turn in the same direction as the hands of a clock--clockwise, glowing  with
exceeding splendor,  far surpassing the brilliant luminosity of the ordinary
desire  body.   These centers furnish him with means for the  perception  of
things in the Desire World and he sees, and investigates as he wills,  while
the person whose centers turn counter-clockwise  is like a mirror, which re-
flects  what passes before it.   Such a person is incapable of reaching  out
for information.   The  reason for this belongs to a later chapter,  but the




[PAGE 68]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

above is one of the fundamental differences between a medium and a  properly
trained  clairvoyant.   It   is impossible for most  people  to  distinguish
between  the two;  yet there is one infallible rule that can be followed  by
anyone:   NO  GENUINELY DEVELOPED SEER WILL EVER EXERCISE THIS  FACULTY  FOR
MONEY OR ITS EQUIVALENT;  NOT WILL HE USE IT TO GRATIFY CURIOSITY;  BUT ONLY
TO HELP HUMANITY.

     No  one  capable of teaching the proper method for the  development  of
this faculty will every charge so much a lesson.   Those demanding money for
the exercise of,  or for giving lessons in these things never have  anything
worth paying for.   The above rule is a safe and sure guide,  which all  may
follow with absolute confidence.

     In a far distant future man's desire body will become as definitely or-
ganized  as are the vital and dense bodies.   When that stage is reached  we
shall all have the power to function in the desire body as we do know in the
dense  body,  which  is the oldest and best organized  of  these  bodies  of
man--the desire body being the youngest.

     The  desire body is rooted in the liver,  as the vital body is  in  the
spleen.

     In all warm-blooded creatures, which are the highest evolved,  and have
feelings, passions and emotions, which reach outward into the world with de-
sire, which may be said to really live in the fuller meaning of the term and
not  merely vegetate--in all such creatures the currents of the desire  body
flow outward from the liver.  The desire stuff is continually welling out in
streams  or currents which travel in curved lines to every point of the  pe-
riphery of the ovoid and then return to the liver through a number of vorti-
ces, much as boiling water is continually welling outward from the source of
heat and returning to it after completing its cycle.




[PAGE 69]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

     The  plants are devoid of this impelling,  energizing principle,  hence
they cannot show life and motion as can the more highly developed organisms.

     Where  there  is vitality and motion,  but no RED blood,  there  is  no
separate desire body.   The creature is simply in the transition stage  from
plant  to  animal  and therefore it moves entirely in the  strength  of  the
group-spirit.

     In the COLD-blooded animals which have a liver and RED blood,  there is
a separate desire body and the group-spirit directs the currents INWARD, be-
cause  in their case the separate spirit (of the individual fish or  reptile
for instance) is entirely outside the dense vehicle.

     When the organism has evolved so far that the separate spirit can  com-
mence to draw into its vehicles then it (the individual spirit) commences to
direct the currents OUTWARD,  and we see the beginning of passionate  exist-
ence and warm blood.  It is the warm, red blood in the liver of the organism
sufficiently evolved to have an Indwelling spirit which energizes the outgo-
ing currents of desire stuff that cause the animal or the man to display de-
sire and passion.   In the case of the animal the spirit is not yet entirely
INdwelling.   It does not become so until the points in the vital  body  and
the  dense body come into correspondence, as explained in Chapter XII.   For
this reason the animal is not a "liver," that is,  he does not live as  com-
pletely as does man, not being capable of as fine desires and emotions,  be-
cause not as fully  conscious.   The mammalia of today are on a higher plane
than was man at the animal stage of his evolution,  because they have  warm,
red blood,  which man did not have at that stage.  This difference in status
is  accounted for by the spiral path of evolution,  which also accounts  for
the fact that man is a higher type of humanity than the present  Angels were




[PAGE 70]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

in  their human stage.   The present mammalia,  which have in  their  animal
stage  attained  to the possession of warm,  red blood,  and  are  therefore
capable of experiencing desire and emotion to some extent will, in the Jupi-
ter  Period,  be a purer and better type of humanity than we are now,  while
from among our present humanity there will be some,  even in the Jupiter Pe-
riod,  who will be openly and avowedly wicked.  Moreover, they will not then
be able to conceal their passions as is now possible,  but will be unabashed
about their evil doing.

     In the light of this exposition of the connection between the liver and
the  life of the organism,  it is noteworthy that in several  European  lan-
guages (English,  German, and the Scandinavian tongues) the same word signi-
fies the organ of the body (the liver) and also "one who lives."

     When  we turn our attention to the four kingdoms in their  relation  to
the  World of Thought we find that minerals,  plants and animals lack a  ve-
hicle correlating them to that World.   Yet we know some animals think,  but
they  are the highest domesticated animals which have come into close  touch
with man for generations and have thus developed a faculty not possessed  by
other animals, which have not had that advantage.  This is on the same prin-
ciple that a highly wire will "induce" a weaker current of electricity in  a
wire brought close to it;  or that a man of strong morals will arouse a like
tendency  in a weaker nature,  while one morally weak will be overthrown  if
brought within the influence of evil characters.   All we do,  say,  or are,
reflects  itself  in our surroundings.   This is why  the  highest  domestic
animals think.   They are the highest of their kind,  almost on the point of
individualization,  and man's thought vibrations have "induced"  in  them  a
similar activity of a lower order.  With the  exceptions  noted,  the animal




[PAGE 71]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

kingdom  has not acquired the faculty of thought.   The are not  INDIVIDUAL-
IZED.  This is the great and cardinal difference between the human and other
kingdoms.   Man is an individual.  The animals,  plants and minerals are di-
vided into species.   They are not individualized in the same sense than man
is.

     It  is true that we divide mankind into races,  tribes and nations;  we
note the difference between the Caucasian, ,  the Negro,  the Indian,  etc.;
but  that is not to the point.   If we wish to study the characteristics  of
the lion or the elephant or any other species of the lower animals, all that
is  necessary is to take any member of that species for that purpose.   When
we learn the characteristics of one animal,  we know the characteristics  of
the species to which it belongs.   All members of the same animal tribe  are
alike.   That is the point.   A lion,  or its father,  or it son,  all  look
alike;  there  is no difference in the way they will act under  like  condi-
tions.  All have the same likes and dislikes; one is the same as another.

     Not so with human beings.  If we want to know about the characteristics
of  Negroes,  it is not enough that we examine one  single  individual.   It
would be necessary to examine each individually,  and even then we will  ar-
rive  at  no knowledge concerning Negroes as a whole,  simply  because  that
which  was a characteristic of the single individual does not apply  to  the
race collectively.

     If we desire to know the character of Abraham Lincoln it will avail  us
nothing to study his father,  his grandfather,  or his son,  for they  would
differ entirely.   Each would have his own peculiarities quite distinct from
the idiosyncrasies of Abraham Lincoln.

     On the other hand,  minerals,  plants, and animals are described if  we
devote our attention to the description of one of each species;  while there




[PAGE 72]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

are as many species among human beings as there are individuals.  Each indi-
vidual person is a "species,"  a law unto himself,  altogether separate  and
apart  from any other individual,  as different from his fellow men  as  one
species in the lower kingdom is from another.  We may write the biography of
a  man,  but an animal can have no biography.   This is because there is  in
each  man an individual,  INDWELLING spirit which dictates the thoughts  and
actions  of each individual human being;  while there is one  "group-spirit"
COMMON  TO  ALL the different animals or plants of the  same  species.   The
group-spirit  works on the all FROM THE OUTSIDE.   The tiger which roams  in
the wilds of the Indian jungle and the tiger penned up in the cage of a  me-
nagerie are both expressions of the same group-spirit.   It influences  both
alike from the Desire World,  distance being almost annihilated in the inner
Worlds.

     The group-spirits of the three lower kingdoms are variously located  in
the higher Worlds,  as we shall see when we investigate the consciousness of
the  different kingdoms;  but to properly comprehend the positions of  these
group-spirits in the inner Worlds it is necessary to remember and to clearly
understand  what has been said about all the forms that are in  the  visible
world having crystallized from models and ideas in the inner Worlds,  as il-
lustrated  by  the  architect's house and the inventor's  machine.   As  the
juices  of the soft body of the snail crystallize into the hard shell  which
it  carries upon its back,  so the Spirits in the higher Worlds have,  in  a
similar manner, crystallized our from themselves the dense,  material bodies
of the different kingdoms.

     Thus the so-called "higher"  bodies,  although so fine and cloudy as to
be invisible, are not by any means "emanations" from the dense body, but the




[PAGE 73]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

dense  vehicles of all kingdoms correspond to the shell of the snail,  which
is crystallized from its juices, the snail representing the spirit;  and the
juices  of its body in their progress towards  crystallization  representing
the mind,  desire body and vital body.  THESE VARIOUS VEHICLES WERE EMANATED
BY  THE  SPIRIT FROM ITSELF for the purpose of  gaining  experience  through
them.   It  is the spirit that moves the dense body where it  will,  as  the
snail moves its house,  and not the body that controls the movements of  the
spirit.   The more closely the spirit is able to enter into touch  with  its
vehicle  the better can it control and express itself through that  vehicle,
and vice versa.  That is the key to the different states of consciousness in
the different kingdoms.  A study of diagrams 3 and 4 should give a clear un-
derstanding  of the vehicles of each kingdom,  the manner in which they  are





                                 DIAGRAM 3:

     Showing the vehicles of each kingdom,  and the manner in which such ve-
hicles are correlated to the different worlds.

correlated to the different Worlds and the resulting state of consciousness.

     From diagram 3 we learn that the separate Ego is definitely  segregated
within  the  Universal Spirit in the Region of Abstract Thought.   It  shows
that  only man possesses the complete chain of vehicles correlating  him  to
all divisions to the three Worlds.  The animal lacks one link of  chain--the
mind;  the plant lacks two links; the mind and the desire body; and the min-
eral lacks three links of the chain of the vehicles necessary to function in
a self-conscious manner in the Physical World-the mind,  the desire and  the
vital bodies.

     The reason for the various deficiencies is that the Mineral Kingdom  is
the expression of the latest stream of evolving life;  the Plant Kingdom  is
ensouled by a life wave that has been longer upon the path of evolution; the




[PAGE 75]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

life wave of the animal kingdom has a still longer past; while Man,  that is
to say,  the life now expressing itself in the human form, has behind it the
longest journey of all the four kingdoms, and therefore leads.  In time, the
three  life-waves which now animate the three lower kingdoms will reach  the
human, and we shall have passed to higher stages of development.

     To  understand the degree of consciousness which results from the  pos-
session  of the vehicles used by the life evolving in the four kingdoms,  we
turn our attention to diagram 4, which shows that man, the Ego, the Thinker,
has descended into the Chemical Region of the Physical World.   Here he  has
marshaled all his vehicles, thereby attaining the state of waking conscious-
ness.   He learning to control his vehicles.   The organs of neither the de-
sire body nor the mind are yet evolved.  The latter is not yet even a  body.
At present it is simply a link,  a sheath for the use of the Ego as a focus-
ing point.  It is the last of the vehicles that have been built.  The spirit
works gradually from finer into coarser substance,  the vehicles also  being
built in finer substance first, then in coarser and coarser substance.   The
dense  body was built first and has now come into its fourth stage  of  den-
sity;  the vital body is in its third stage and the desire body in its  sec-
ond,  hence it is still cloud-like, and the sheath of mind is filmier still.
As  those vehicles have not,  as yet, evolved any organs,  it is clear  that
they ALONE would be useless as vehicles of consciousness.  The Ego, however,
enters  INTO the dense body and connects these organless vehicles  with  the
physical sense centers and thus attains the waking state of consciousness in
the Physical World.

     The  student should particularly note that it is because of their  con-
nection with the splendidly organized mechanism of the dense body that these

[PAGE 76]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

higher  vehicles become of value at present.   He will thus avoid a  mistake
frequently made by people who,  when they come into the knowledge that there
are  higher bodies,  grow to despise the dense vehicle;  to speak of  it  as
"low"  and "vile"--turning their eyes to heaven and wishing that they  might
soon  be  able  to leave this earthly lump of clay and fly  about  in  their
"higher vehicles."

     These  people generally do not realize the difference between  "higher"
and "perfect."  Certainly, the dense body is the lowest vehicle in the sense
that it is the most unwieldy, correlating man to the world of sense with all
the  limitations  thus implied.   As stated, it has an  enormous  period  of
evolution  back  of it;  is in it fourth state of development  and  has  now
reached a great and marvelous degree of efficiency.  It will, in time, reach
perfection,  but even at present it is the best organized of man's vehicles.
The vital body is in its third stage of evolution, and less completely orga-
nized than the dense body.  The desire body and the mind are,  as yet,  mere
clouds--almost entirely unorganized.  In the very lowest human beings  these
vehicles  are not even definite ovoids;  they are more or less undefined  in
form.

     The  dense body is a wonderfully constructed instrument and  should  be
recognized as such by everyone pretending to have any knowledge of the  con-
stitution of man.   Observe the femur, for instance.   This bone carries the
entire  weight of the body.   On the outside it is built of a thin layer  of
compact  bone,  strengthened  on  the inside by  beams  and  cross-beams  of
cancellated bone, in such a marvelous manner that the most skilled bridge or
construction  engineer could never accomplish the feat of building a  pillar
of equal strength  with  so little weight.  The bones of the skull are built




[PAGE 77]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

in  a  similar manner,  always the least possible material is used  and  the
maximum  of strength obtained.   Consider the wisdom manifested in the  con-
struction  of the heart and then question if this superb mechanism  deserves
to be despised.   The wise man is grateful for his dense body and takes  the
best possible care of it,  because he knows that it is the most valuable  of
his present instruments.

     The animal spirit has in its descent reached only the Desire World.  It
has not yet evolved to the point where it can "enter" a dense body.   There-
fore  the animal has no individual INdwelling spirit,  but  a  group-spirit,
which  directs it FROM WITHOUT.   The animal has the dense body,  the  vital
body and the desire body,  but the group-spirit which directs it is outside.
The vital body and the desire body of an animal are not entirely within  the
dense  body,  especially  where the head is concerned.   For  instance,  the
etheric  head  of a horse projects far beyond and above the  dense  physical
head.   When, as in rare cases it happens, the etheric head of a horse draws
into  the head of the dense body,  that horse can learn to read,  count  and
work examples in elementary arithmetic.  To this peculiarity is also due the
fact that horses, dogs, cats and other domesticated animals sense the Desire
World,  though  not  always  realizing the difference  between  it  and  the
Physical World.   A horse will shy at the sight of a figure invisible to the
driver;  a cat will go through the motions of rubbing itself against  invis-
ible legs.  The cat sees the ghost, however without realizing that it has no
dense legs available for frictional purposes.  The dog,  wiser than a cat or
horse, will often sense that there is something he does not understand about
the  appearance of a dead master whose hands it cannot lick.   It will  howl
mournfully and slink into a corner with its tail between its legs.  The fol-
lowing illustration may perhaps be of service to show the difference between




[PAGE 78]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the man with his indwelling spirit and the animal with its group-spirit.

     Let  us imagine a room divided by means of a curtain,  one side of  the
curtain representing the Desire World and the other the Physical.  There are
two men in the room,  one in each division; they cannot see each other,  nor
can they get into the same division.  There are,  however,  ten holes in the
curtain and the man who is in the division representing the Desire World can
put his ten fingers through these holes into the other division,  represent-
ing the Physical World.  He now furnishes an excellent representation of the
group-spirit  which  is  in the Desire World.   The  fingers  represent  the
animals belonging to one species.  He is able to move them as he wills,  but
he  cannot  use them freely nor as intelligently as the man who  is  walking
about in the Physical division uses his body.   The latter sees the  fingers
which are thrust through the curtain and he observes that they all move, but
he does not see the connection between them.   To him it appears as if  they
were  all separate and distinct from one another.   He cannot see that  they
are  fingers of the man behind the veil and are governed in their  movements
by  his intelligence.   If he hurts one of the fingers,  it is not only  the
finger that he hurts,  but chiefly the man on the other side of the curtain.
If  an  animal  is  hurt,  it  suffers, but  not  to  the  degree  that  the
group-spirit does.  The finger has no individualized consciousness; it moves
as the man dictates--so do the animals moves as the  group-spirit  dictates.
We hear of "animal instinct" and "blind instinct."   There is no such vague,
indefinite thing as "blind"  instinct.   There is nothing "blind"  about the
way the group-spirit guides  its  members--there  is Wisdom,   spelled  with




[PAGE 79]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

capitals.   The trained clairvoyant,  when functioning in the Desire  World,
can communicate with these spirits of the animal species and finds them much
more intelligent than a large percent of human beings.   He can see the mar-
velous  insight  they  display in marshaling the  animals  which  are  their
physical bodies.

     It is the spirit of the group which gathers its flocks of birds in  the
fall  and compels them to migrate to the south,  neither too early  nor  too
late to escape the winter's chilly blast;  that directs their return in  the
spring,  causing them to fly at just the proper altitude,  which differs for
the different species.

     The  group-spirit  of the beaver teaches it to build its dam  across  a
stream at exactly the proper angle.   It considers the rapidity of the flow,
and all the circumstances, precisely as a skilled engineer would do, showing
that  it  is  as  up-to-date  in every  particular  of  the   craft  as  the
college-bred,   technically-educated  man.    It  is  the  wisdom   of   the
group-spirit  that directs the building of the hexagon cell of the bee  with
such geometrical nicety;  that teaches the snail to fashion its house in  an
accurate,  beautiful  spiral;  that teaches the ocean  mollusk  the  art  of
decorating its iridescent shell.   Wisdom, wisdom everywhere!  So grand,  so
great  that one who looks with an observant eye is filed with amazement  and
reverence.

     At  this  point  the thought will naturally occur that  if  the  animal
group-spirit  is so wise,  considering the short period of evolution of  the
animal as compared with that of man, why does not the latter display  wisdom
to a much greater degree and why must man be taught to build dams and  geom-
etrize, all of which the group spirit does without being taught?





[PAGE 80]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

        The  answer  to  that  question  has  to  do  with  the  descent  of
the Universal Spirit into matter of ever-increasing density.   In the higher
Worlds,  where its vehicles are fewer and finer,  it is in closer touch with
cosmic  wisdom  which  shines out in a manner  inconceivable  in  the  dense
Physical World, but as the spirit descends, the light of wisdom becomes tem-
porarily more and more dimmed, until in the densest of all the Worlds, it is
held almost entirely in abeyance.

     An  illustration will make this clearer.  The hand is man's most  valu-
able servant;  its dexterity enables it to respond to his slightest bidding.
In some vocations,  such as bank teller, the delicate touch of the hand  be-
comes so sensitive, that it is able to distinguish a counterfeit coin from a
genuine in a way so marvelous that one would almost think the hand were  en-
dowed with individual intelligence.

     Its greatest efficiency is perhaps reached in the production of  music.
It is capable of producing the most beautiful, soul-stirring melodies.   The
delicate,  caressing  touch  of the hand elicits the  tenderest  strains  of
soul-speech  from  the instrument,  telling of the sorrows,  the  joys,  the
hopes,  the fears and the longings of the soul in a way that nothing but mu-
sic can do.  It is the language of the heaven world, the spirit's true home,
and comes to the divine spark imprisoned in flesh as a message from its  na-
tive  land.   Music  appeals to all, regardless of  race,  creed,  or  other
worldly  distinction.   The  higher and more spiritual  the  individual  the
plainer does it speak to him and even "the savage breast"  is not unmoved by
it.

     Let us now imagine a master musician putting on thin gloves and  trying
to play his violin.  We note at once that the delicate touch is less subtle;
the soul of the music is gone.  If he puts another and  a  heavier  pair  of




[PAGE 81]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

gloves over the first pair,  his hand is hampered to such an extent that  he
may occasionally create a discord instead of the former harmony.   Should he
at  last put on,  in addition to the two pairs of gloves  already  hampering
him, a pair of still heavier mittens, he would, temporarily, be entirely un-
able to  play,  and one who had not heard him play previously to the time he
put  on the gloves and the mittens, would naturally think that he had  never
been able to do so, especially if ignorant of the hampering of his hands.

     So it is with the Spirit;  every step down,  every descent into coarser
matter is to it what the putting on of a pair of gloves would be to the  mu-
sician.   Every step down limits its power of expression until it has become
accustomed to the limitations and has found its focus,  in the same way that
the  eye must find its focus after we enter a house on a bright summer  day.
The  pupil of the eye contracts to its limit in the glare of the sun and  on
entering the house all seems dark; but, as the pupil expands, and admits the
light, the man is enabled to see as well in the dimmer light of the house as
he did in the sunlight.

     The purpose of man's evolution here is to enable him to find his  focus
in the Physical World,  where at present the light of wisdom seems obscured.
But when in time we have "found the light," the wisdom of man will shine for
forth  in  his  actions,  and  far  surpass  the  wisdom  expressed  by  the
group-spirit of the animal.

     Besides,  a distinction must be made between the group spirit  and  the
virgin  spirits  of  the life wave now expressing itself  as  animals.   The
group-spirit  belongs  to a different evolution and is the guardian  of  the
animal spirits.

     The dense body in which we function is composed of numerous cells, each
having separate cellconsciousness, though of a very low order.   While these
cells from part of our body they  are  subjected  to  an  dominated  by  OUR




[PAGE 82]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

consciousness.  An animal group-spirit functions in a SPIRITUAL BODY,  which
is  its lowest vehicle  This vehicle consists of a varying number of  virgin
spirits   imbued  for  the  time  being  with  the  consciousness   of   the
group-spirit.   The latter directs the vehicles built by the virgin  spirits
in  its charge,  caring for them and helping them to evolve their  vehicles.
As its wards evolve,  the group-spirit also evolves,  undergoing a series of
metamorphoses, in a manner similar to that in which we grow and gain experi-
ence  by taking into our bodies the cells of the food we eat,  thereby  also
raising their consciousness by enduing them with ours for a time.

     Thus while a separate, self-conscious Ego is within each human body and
dominates the actions of its particular vehicle,  the spirit of the separate
animal is not yet individualized and self-conscious,  but forms part of  the
vehicle of a self-conscious entity belonging to a  different  evolution--the
group-spirit.

     The  group-spirit dominates the actions of the animals in harmony  with
cosmic  law,  until  the  virgin spirits in its  charge  shall  have  gained
self-consciousness  and  become human.   Then they will  gradually  manifest
wills of their own,  gaining more and more freedom from the group-spirit and
becoming responsible for their own actions.  The group-spirit will influence
them, however (although in a decreasing degree), as race, tribe,  community,
or family spirit until each individual has become capable of acting in  full
harmony with cosmic law.   Not until that time will the Ego be entirely free
and independent of the group-spirit, which will then enter a higher phase of
evolution.

     The position occupied by the group-spirit in the Desire World  gives to




[PAGE 83]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

the  animal  a consciousness different form that of man,  who has  a  clear,
definite waking consciousness.  Man sees things OUTSIDE of himself in sharp,
distinct outlines.  Owing to the spiral path of evolution, the higher domes-
tic animals,  particularly the dog,  horse, cat and elephant see objects  in
somewhat  the same way,  though perhaps not so clearly defined.   All  other
animals have an internal "picture consciousness"  similar to the dream-state
in man.   When such an animal is confronted by an object,  a picture is  im-
mediately perceived WITHIN,  accompanied by a strong impression that the ob-
ject  is inimical or beneficial to its welfare.   If the feeling is  one  of
fear, it is associated with a suggestion from the group-spirit how to escape
the threatened danger.  This negative state of consciousness renders it easy
for the group-spirit to guide the dense bodies of its charges by suggestion,
as the animals have no will of their own.

     Man is not so easily managed from without,  either with or without  his
consent.  As evolution progresses and man's will develops more and more,  he
will become non-amenable to outside suggestion and free to do as he  pleases
regardless of suggestions from others.  This is the chief difference between
man and the other kingdoms.   They act according to law and the dictates  of
the  group-spirit (which we call instinct), while man is becoming  more  and
more a law unto himself.   We do not ask the mineral whether or not it  will
crystallize,  nor the flower whether it will or will not bloom, nor the lion
whether it will or will not cease to prey.  They are all, in the smallest as
in the greatest matter,  under the absolute domination of the  group-spirit,
being without free will and initiative which, in some degree,  are possessed
by every human being.   All  animals  of the same species look nearly alike,




[PAGE 84]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

because  they emanate from the same group-spirit,  while among  the  fifteen
hundred  millions of human beings who people the Earth no two  look  exactly
alike,  not even twins when adolescent,  because the stamp that is put  upon
each by the indwelling individual Ego makes the difference in appearance  as
well as in character.

     That  all  oxen thrive on grass,  and all lions eat flesh,  while  "one
man's  meat  is  another  man's  poison"  is  another  illustration  of  the
all-inclusive influence of the group-spirit as contrasted with the Ego which
makes  each  human being require a different proportion of food  from  every
other.   Doctors note with perplexity the same peculiarity in  administering
medicine.   Its acts differently upon different individuals,  while the same
medicine will produce identical effects on two animals of the same  species,
owing  to the fact that animals all follow the dictates of the  group-spirit
and Cosmic Law--always act similarly in identical circumstances.  Man  alone
is,  in some measure,  able to follow his own desires within certain limits.
That  his mistakes are many and grievous, is granted,  and to many it  might
seem better if he were forced into the right way, but if this were done,  he
would  never learn to do right.  Lessons of discrimination between good  and
evil  cannot be learned unless he is free to choose his own course  and  has
learned to eschew the wrong as a veritable "womb of pain."   If he did right
only because he had no choice,  and had no chance to do otherwise,  he would
be but an automaton and not an evolving God.   As the builder learns by  his
mistakes,  correcting past errors in future buildings,  so man,  by means of
his blunders, and the pain they cause him, is attaining to a higher (because
self-conscious) wisdom than the animal,  which acts wisely because it is im-
pelled to action by the group-spirit.  In time the animal will become human,




[PAGE 85]                                                  THE FOUR KINGDOMS

have  liberty  of choice and will make mistakes and learn by them as  we  do
now.

     Diagram 4 shows that the group-spirit of the plant kingdom has its low-
est vehicle in the Region of Concrete Thought.  It is two steps removed from
its  dense vehicle and consequently the plants have a  consciousness  corre-
sponding  to that of DREAMLESS SLEEP.  The group-spirit  of the mineral  has
it  slowest vehicle in the Region of Abstract Thought and it is,  therefore,
three steps removed from its dense vehicle;  hence it is in a state of  deep
unconsciousness similar to the TRANCE condition.

     We have now shown that man is an individual indwelling spirit,  an  Ego
separate  from all other entities,  directing and working in one set of  ve-
hicles from WITHIN ,  and that plants and animals are directed from  WITHOUT
by a group-spirit having jurisdiction over a number of animals or plants  in
our Physical World.  They are separate only in appearance.

     The  relations  of plant,  animal and man to the life currents  in  the
Earth's atmosphere are symbolically represented by the cross.   The  Mineral
Kingdom is not represented,  because as we have seen,  it possesses no indi-
vidual vital body, hence cannot be the vehicle for currents belonging to the
higher realms.   Plato,  who was an Initiate, often gave occult truths.   He
said "The World-Soul is crucified."

     The  lower limb of the cross indicates the plant with its root  in  the
chemical mineral soil.  The group-spirits of plants are at the center of the
Earth.   They are (it will be remembered) in the Region of Concrete Thought,
which inter-penetrates the Earth,  as do all the other Worlds.   From  these
group-spirits flow streams or currents in all directions to the periphery of




[PAGE 86]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the Earth, passing outward through the length of plant or tree.

     Man is represented by the upper limb;  his is the INVERTED PLANT.   The
plant takes its food through the root.  Man takes his food through the head.
The  plant stretches its generative organs towards the sun.   Man,  the  in-
verted plant,  turns his towards the center of the earth.  The plant is sus-
tained  by the spiritual currents of the group-spirit in the center  of  the
earth,  which enter into it by way of the root.  Later it will be shown that
the highest spiritual influence comes to man from the sun,  which sends  its
rays through man,  the inverted plant, from the head downwards.   The  plant
inhales  the  poisonous  carbon-dioxide  exhales  by  man  and  exhales  the
life-giving oxygen used by him.

     The animal, which is symbolized by the horizontal limb of the cross, is
between  the plant and the man.   Its spine is in a horizontal position  and
through  it play the currents of the animal group-spirit which encircle  the
Earth.   No animal can be made to remain constantly upright, because in that
case the currents of the group-spirit could not guide it, and if it were not
sufficiently individualized to endure the spiritual currents which enter the
vertical human spine,  it would die.  It is necessary that a vehicle for the
expression of an individual Ego shall  have  three things--an upright  walk,
that  it  may come into touch with the currents just mentioned;  an  upright
larynx,  for only such a larynx is capable of speech (parrots and  starlings
are examples of this effect of the upright larynx); and,  owing to the solar
currents,  it must have warm blood.   The latter is of the utmost importance
to the Ego, which will be logically explained and illustrated later.   These
requisites are simply mentioned here as the last words on the status of  the
four kingdoms in relation to each other and to the Worlds.

                      MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

                ACTIVITIES OF LIFE; MEMORY AND SOUL-GROWTH

    Our study thus far of the seven Worlds or states of matter has shown  us
that each serves a definite purpose in the economy of nature,  and that God,
the  Great Spirit,  in Whom we actually and in fact "live and move and  have
our being," is the Power that permeates and sustains the whole Universe with
Its  Life;  but while that Life flows into and is immanent in every atom  of
the  six  lower  Worlds  and  all  contained  therein, in  the  Seventh--the
highest--the Triune God alone IS.

    The  next highest or sixth realm is the World of Virgin  Spirits.   Here
those  sparks from the divine "Flame: have their being before they  commence
their long pilgrimage through the five denser Worlds for the purpose of  de-
veloping latent potentialities into dynamic powers.  As the seed unfolds its
hidden  possibilities by being buried in the soil,  so these virgin  spirits
will,  in time,  when they have passed through matter (the school of experi-
ence), also become divine "Flames," capable of bringing forth universes from
themselves.

    The five Worlds constitute the field of man's evolution, the three lower
or denser being the scene of the present phase of his development.   We will
now consider his as related to these five Worlds by means of his appropriate
vehicles, remembering the two grand divisions into which two of these Worlds
are  divided,  and  than  man  has  a  vehicle  for each of these divisions.

                 THE SEVENFOLD CONSTITUTION OF MAN




    In   the   waking  state  these  vehicles  are   all   together.    They
inter-penetrate one another as the blood, the lymph, and other juices of the
body inter-penetrate.  Thus is the Ego enabled to act in the Physical World.

    We ourselves,  as Egos, function directly in the subtle substance of the
Region of Abstract Thought,  which we have specialized within the  periphery
of  our individual aura.   Thence we view the impressions made by the  outer
world upon the vital body through the senses, together with the feelings and
emotions generated by them in the desire body, and mirrored in the mind.

    From  these mental images we form our conclusions,  in the substance  of
the  Region  of Abstract Thought,  concerning the subjects with  which  they
deal.  Those conclusions are ideas.  By the power of will we project an idea
through the mind, where it takes concrete shape as a thought-form by drawing
mind-stuff around itself from the Region of Concrete Thought.




[PAGE 89]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

    The mind is like the projecting lens of a stereopticon.  It projects the
image  in  one of three directions,  according to the will of  the  thinker,
which ensouls the thought-form.

    (1)   It  may  be projected against the desire body in  an  endeavor  to
arouse feeling which will lead to immediate action.

    (a)  If the thought awakens Interest, one of the twin forces, Attraction
or Repulsion, will be stirred up.

    If Attraction, the centripetal force, is aroused, it seizes the thought,
whirls it into the desire body, endows the image with added life and clothes
it with desire-stuff.  Then the thought is able to act on the etheric brain,
and propel the vital force through the appropriate brain centers and  nerves
to the voluntary muscles which perform the necessary action.  Thus the force
in  the thought is expended and the image remains in the ether of the  vital
body as memory of the act and the feeling that caused it.

    (b)   Repulsion is the centrifugal force and if that is aroused  by  the
thought  there will be a struggle between the spiritual force (the  will  of
the man) within the thought-form,  and the desire body.   This is the battle
between  conscience  and  desire,  the higher and  the  lower  nature.   The
spiritual force, in spite of resistance will seek to clothe the thought-form
in the desire-stuff needed to manipulate the brain and muscles.   The  force
of Repulsion will endeavor to scatter the appropriated material and oust the
thought.   If the spiritual energy is strong it may force its way through to
the  brain centers and hold its clothing of desire-stuff while  manipulating
the vital force, thus compelling action, and will then leave upon the memory
a vivid impression of the struggle and the victory.  If the spiritual energy
is exhausted before action has resulted, it will be overcome by the force of




[PAGE 90]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Repulsion,  and will be stored in the memory, as are all other thought-forms
when they have expended their energy.

    (c)  If the thought-form meets the withering feeling of Indifference  it
depends upon the spiritual energy contained in it whether it will be able to
compel action,  or simply leave a weak impress upon the reflecting ether  of
the vital body after its kinetic energy has been exhausted.

    (2)  Where no immediate action is called for by the mental images of im-
pacts  from  without,  these may be projected directly upon  the  reflecting
ether, together with the thoughts occasioned by them, to be used at some fu-
ture time.   The spirit, working through the mind, has instant access to the
storehouse of conscious memory and may at any time resurrect any of the pic-
tures  found there,  endue them with new spiritual force,  and project  them
upon  the  desire body to compel action.  Each time such a picture  is  thus
used it will gain in vividness, strength and efficiency, and will compel ac-
tion  along  its particular line grooves,  and produces  the  phenomenon  of
thought, "gaining" or "growing" upon us by repetition.

    (3)  A third way of using a thought-form is when the thinker projects it
toward another mind to act as a suggestion, to carry information,  etc.,  as
in  thought-transference,  or it may be directed against the desire body  of
another person to compel action, as in the case of a hypnotist influencing a
victim at a distance.   It will then act in precisely the same manner as  if
it were the victim's own thought.   If in line with his proclivities it will
act as per paragraph 1a.   If contrary to his nature,  as described in 1b or
1c.

    When  the work designed for such a projected thought-form has  been  ac-
complished, or its energy expended in vain attempts to achieve  its  object,




[PAGE 91]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

it gravitates back to its creator,  bearing with it the indelible record  of
the  journey.   It success or failure is imprinted on the negative atoms  of
the reflecting ether of its creator's vital body,  where it forms that  part
of the record of the thinker's life and action which is sometimes called the
sub-conscious mind.

    This record is much more important than the memory to which we have con-
scious  access,  for  the  latter is made up  from  imperfect  and  illusive
sense-perceptions and is the voluntary memory or conscious mind.

    The involuntary memory or sub-conscious mind comes into being in a  dif-
ferent way,  altogether beyond our control at present.  As the ether carries
to the sensitive film in the camera an accurate impression of the  surround-
ing landscape,  taking in the minutest detail regardless of whether the pho-
tographer has observed it or not,  so the ether contained in the air we  in-
spire  carries  with  it  an  accurate  and  detailed  picture  of  all  our
surroundings.  Not only of material things, but also the conditions existing
each moment within our aura.   The slightest thought,  feeling or emotion is
transmitted to the lungs, where it is injected into the blood.  The blood is
one of the highest products of the vital body as it is the carrier of  nour-
ishment to every part of the body,  and the direct vehicle of the Ego.   The
pictures  it  contains are impressed upon the negative atoms  of  the  vital
body, to serve as arbiters of the man's destiny in the POST MORTEM state.

    The  memory (or so-called mind), both conscious and  sub-conscious,  re-
lates WHOLLY to the experiences of this life.  It consists of impressions of
events on the vital body.  These may be changed or even eradicated, as noted
in the explanation concerning the forgiveness of sins which is given  a  few




[PAGE 92]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

pages further on,  which change or eradication depends upon the  elimination
of these impressions from the ether of the vital body.

    There  is also a superconscious memory.  That is the storehouse  of  all
faculties  acquired and knowledge gained in previous lives,  though  perhaps
latent in the present life.   This record is indelibly engraven on the  life
spirit.   It manifests ordinarily,  thought not to the full extent,  as con-
science and character which ensoul all thought-forms,  sometimes as counsel-
lor,  sometimes compelling action with resistless force,  even  contrary  to
reason and desire.

    In  many  women,  in whom the vital body is positive,  and  in  advanced
people of either sex where the vital body has been sensitized by a pure  and
holy life,  by prayer and concentration, this superconscious memory inherent
in the life spirit is occasionally,  to some extent,  above the necessity of
clothing  itself in mind stuff and desire matter in order to compel  action.
It  does not always need to incur the danger of being subjected to and  per-
haps overruled by a process of reasoning.   Sometimes,  in the form of intu-
ition  or teaching from within,  it impresses itself directly upon  the  re-
flecting ether of the vital body.  The more readily we learn to recognize it
and follow its dictates, the oftener it will speak, to our eternal welfare.

    By their activities during waking hours the desire body and the mind are
constantly destroying the dense vehicle.  Every thought and movement  breaks
down tissue.   On the other hand, the vital body faithfully endeavors to re-
store harmony and build up what the other vehicles are tearing down.   It is
not able,  however, to entirely withstand the powerful onslaughts of the im-
pulses and thoughts.  It gradually loses ground and at last  there  comes  a




[PAGE 93]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

time  when it collapses.   Its "points" shrivel-up,  so to say.   The  vital
fluid ceases to flow along the nerves is sufficient quantity;  the body  be-
comes drowsy,  the Thinker is hampered by its drowsiness and forced to with-
draw,  taking the desire body with him.   This withdrawal of the higher  ve-
hicle  leaves  the  dense  body interpenetrated by the  vital  body  in  the
senseless state we call sleep.

    Sleep,  however, is not by any means an inactive state, as people gener-
ally suppose.   It it were,  the body would be no different on awakening  in
the morning from its condition when it went to sleep at night;  its  fatigue
would be just as great.   On the contrary,  sleep is a period of intense ac-
tivity and the more intense it is the greater its value,  for it  eliminates
the  poisons resulting from tissue destroyed by the mental and physical  ac-
tivities  of the day.   The tissues are re-built and the rhythm of the  body
restored.  The more thoroughly this work is done the greater the benefit ac-
cruing from sleep.

    The Desire World is an ocean of wisdom and harmony.   Into this the  Ego
takes the mind and the desire body when the lower vehicles have been left to
sleep.  There the first care of the Ego is the restoration of the rhythm and
harmony of the mind and the desire body.   This restoration is  accomplished
gradually  as  the harmonious vibrations of the Desire  World  flow  through
them.   There is an essence in the Desire World corresponding to  the  vital
fluid which permeates the dense body by means of the vital body.  The higher
vehicles,  as  it  were,  steep themselves in this  elixir  of  life.   When
strengthened,  they commence work on the vital body, which was left with the
sleeping dense body.  Then the vital body begins  to  specialize  the  solar




[PAGE 94]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

energy  anew,  rebuilding the dense body,  using particularly  the  chemical
ether as its medium in the process of restoration.

    It is this activity of the different vehicles during sleep which   forms
the basis for the activity of the following day.   Without that there  would
be  no  awakening,  for the Ego was forced to abandon his  vehicles  because
their weariness rendered them useless.  If the work of removing that fatigue
were  not  done,  the bodies would remain asleep,  as sometimes  happens  in
natural trance.  It is just because of this harmonizing, recuperative activ-
ity that sleep is better than doctor or medicine in preserving health.  Mere
rest is nothing is comparison with sleep.  It is only while the  higher  ve-
hicles are in the Desire World that there is a total suspension of waste and
an influx of restoring force.  It is true that during rest the vital body is
not  hampered in its work by tissue being broken down by active  motion  and
tense muscles,  but still it must contend with the wasting energy of thought
and it does not then receive the OUTSIDE recuperative force from the  desire
body as during sleep.

    It happens,  however, that at times the desire body does not fully with-
draw,  so that part of it remains connected with the vital body, the vehicle
for  sense perception and memory.   The result is that restoration  is  only
partly accomplished and that the senses and actions of the Desire World  are
brought  into the physical consciousness as dreams.   Of course most  dreams
are confused as the axis of perception is askew, because of the improper re-
lation of one body to another.   The memory is also confused by this  incon-
gruous relation of the vehicles and as a result of the loss of the restoring
force, dream-filled sleep is restless and the body feels tired on awakening.

    During the life the threefold spirit,  the Ego,  works  on  and  in  the




[PAGE 95]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

threefold  body,  to which it is connected by the link of mind.   This  work
brings the threefold soul into being.  The soul is the spiritualized product
of the body.

[PAGE 96]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    As  proper food feeds the body in a material sense,  so the activity  of
the spirit in the dense body,  which results in RIGHT ACTION,  promotes  the
growth of the Conscious Soul.   As the forces from the sun play in the vital
body and nourish it, that it may act on the dense body, so the memory of ac-
tions done in the dense body-the desires,  feelings and emotions of the  de-
sire body and the thoughts and ideas in the mind-cause the growth of the In-
tellectual  Soul.   In like manner the HIGHEST DESIRES and EMOTIONS  of  the
desire body form the Emotional Soul.

    This threefold soul in turn enhances the consciousness of the  threefold
spirit.

    The Emotional Soul, which is the extract of the desire body, adds to the
efficiency  of the Human Spirit,  which is the spiritual counterpart of  the
desire body.

    The Intellectual Soul gives added power to the Life Spirit,  because the
Intellectual  Soul is extracted from the vital body,  which is the  material
counterpart of the Life Spirit.

    The Conscious Soul increases the consciousness of the Divine Spirit  be-
cause it (the Conscious Soul) is the extract of the dense body, which latter
is the counterpart of the Divine Spirit.

                            DEATH AND PURGATORY

    So  man  builds and sows until the moment of death  arrives.   Then  the
seed-time and the periods of growth and ripening are past.  The harvest time
has  come,  when the skeleton spectre of Death arrives with his  scythe  and
hour-glass.   That is a good symbol.  The skeleton symbolizes the relatively
permanent part of the body.  The scythe represents the fact that this perma-
nent part,  which is about to be harvested by the spirit, is the fruitage of




[PAGE 97]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

the life now drawing to a close.  The hour-glass in his hand indicates  that
the hour does not strike until the full course has been run in harmony  with
unvarying laws.  When that moment arrives a separation of the vehicles takes
place.  As his life in the Physical World is ended for the time being, it is
not necessary for man to retain his dense body.  The vital body, which as we
have explained,  also belongs to the Physical World,  is withdrawn by way of
the head, leaving the dense body inanimate.

    The higher vehicles--vital body, desire body and mind-are seen to  leave
the  dense  body with a spiral movement, taking with them the  SOUL  of  one
dense  atom.   Not the atom itself,  but THE FORCES  that played through  it.
The  results of the experiences passed through in the dense body during  the
life  just ended have been impressed upon this particular atom.   While  all
the other atoms of the dense body have been renewed from time to time,  this
permanent atom has remained.   It has remained stable,  not only through one
life,  but it has been a part of every dense body ever used by a  particular
Ego.   It  is  withdrawn at death only to reawaken at the  dawn  of  another
physical life,  to serve again as the nucleus around which is built the  new
dense  body  to  be  used  by the same Ego.   It  is  therefore  called  the
"Seed-Atom."  During life the seed-atom is situated in the left ventricle of
the  heart,  near the apex.   At death it rises to the brain by way  of  the
pneumogastric nerve,  leaving the dense body,  together with the higher  ve-
hicles, by way of the sutures between the parietal and occipital bones.

    When  the higher vehicles have left the dense body they are  still  con-
nected with it by a slender,  glistening,  silvery cord shaped much like two




[PAGE 98]                                   THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

figure sixes reversed, one upright and one horizontally placed, the two con-
nected at the extremities of the hooks.  (See diagram 5 1/2.)

    One  end is fastened to the heart by means of the seed-atom,  and it  is
the rupture of the seed-atom which causes the heart to stop.   The cord  it-
self  is not snapped until the panorama of the past life,  contained in  the
vital body, has been reviewed.

    Care should be taken,  however,  not to cremate or embalm the body until
at least three days after death, for while the vital body is with the higher
vehicles,  and they are still connected with the dense body by means of  the
silver cord,  any POST MORTEM examination or other injury to the dense  body
will be felt, in a measure, by the man.



                            DIAGRAM 5 1/2: 

                           THE SILVER CORD




    Cremation  should be particularly avoided in the first three days  after
death, because it tends to disintegrate the vital body, which should be kept
intact  until the panorama of the past life has been etched into the  desire
body.

    The silver cord snaps at the point where the sixes unite, half remaining
with the dense body and the other half with the higher vehicles.   From  the




[PAGE 99]                                    MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

time the cord snaps the dense body is quite dead.

    In the beginning of 1906 Dr.  McDougall made a series of experiments  in
the Massachusetts General Hospital, to determine, if possible,  whether any-
thing  not ordinarily visible left the body at death.   For this purpose  he
constructed a pair of scales capable of registering differences of one-tenth
of an ounce.

    The dying person and his bed were placed on one of the platforms of  the
scale,  which was then balanced by weights placed on the opposite  platform.
In  every  instance it was noted that at the precise moment when  the  dying
person  drew the last breath,  the platform containing the  weights  dropped
with startling suddenness,  lifting the bed and the body,  thus showing that
something invisible,  but having weight,  had left the body.   Thereupon the
newspapers  all  over the country announced in glaring  headlines  that  Dr.
McDougall had "weighed the soul."

    Occultism hails with joy the discoveries of modern science,  as they in-
variably corroborate what occult science has long taught.   The  experiments
of  Dr.  McDougall showed conclusively that something invisible to  ordinary
sight left the body at death,  as trained clairvoyants had seen,  and as had
been  stated  in  lectures and literature for many  years  previous  to  Dr.
McDougall's discovery.

    But this invisible "something"  is not the soul.   There is a great dif-
ference.   The reporters jump at conclusions when they state that the scien-
tists have "weighed the soul."    The soul belongs to higher realms and  can
never be weighed on physical scales,  even though they registered variations
of one-millionth part of a grain instead of one-tenth of an ounce.




[PAGE 100]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    IT WAS THE VITAL BODY WHICH THE SCIENTIST WEIGHED.   It is formed of the
four ethers and they belong to the Physical World.

    As we have seen,  a certain amount of this ether is "superimposed"  upon
the  ether  which envelops the particles of the human body and  is  confined
there during physical life,  adding in a slight degree to the weight of  the
dense body of plant, animal and man.  In death it escapes; hence the diminu-
tion  in weight noticed by Dr.  McDougall when the persons with whom he  ex-
perimented expired.

    Dr.  McDougall  also  tried his scales in weighing  dying  animals.   No
diminution was found here, though one of the animals was a St.  Bernard dog.
That was taken to indicate that animals have no souls.  A little later, how-
ever,  Professor La V.  Twining,  head of the Science Department of the  Los
Angeles Polytechnic School, experimented with mice and kittens, which he en-
closed in hermetically sealed glass flasks.  His scales were the most sensi-
tive  procurable and were enclosed in a glass case from which  all  moisture
had been removed.  It was found that all the animals observed lost weight at
death.   A good sized mouse,  weighing 12.886 grams,  suddenly lost 3.1 mil-
ligrams at death.

    A  kitten used in another experiment lost one hundred  milligrams  while
dying and at its last gasp it suddenly lost an additional sixty  milligrams.
After that it lost weight slowly, due to evaporation.

    Thus the teaching of occult science in regard to the possession of vital
bodies  by  animals was also vindicated when sufficiently fine  scales  were
used,  and the case where the rather insensitive scales did not show diminu-
tion  in the weight of the St.  Bernard dog shows that the vital  bodies  of
animals are proportionately lighter than in man.




[PAGE 101]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

    When the "silver cord"  is loosened in the heart,  and man has been  re-
leased from his dense body,  a moment of the highest importance comes to the
Ego,  and it cannot be too seriously impressed upon the relatives of a dying
person  that it is a great crime against the departing soul to give  expres-
sion to loud grief and lamentations, for it is just then engaged in a matter
of supreme importance and a great deal of the value of the past life depends
upon how much attention the soul can give to this matter.  This will be made
clearer when we come to the description of man's life in the Desire World.

    It is also a crime against the dying to administer stimulants which have
the  effect of forcing the higher vehicles back into the dense body  with  a
jerk,  thus imparting a great shock to the man.   It is not torture to  pass
out, but it is torture to be dragged back to endure further suffering.  Some
who have passed out have told investigators that they had, in that way, been
kept  dying for hours and had prayed that their relatives would cease  their
mistaken kindness and let them die.

    When the man is freed from the dense body,  which was the heaviest  clog
upon his spiritual power (like the heavy mitten on the hand of the  musician
in our previous illustration),  his spiritual power comes back in some  mea-
sure,  and he is able to read the pictures in the negative pole of  the  re-
flecting  ether of his vital body,  which is the seat of  the  sub-conscious
memory.

    The whole of his past life passes before his sight like a panorama,  the
events being presented IN REVERSE ORDER.  The incidents of the days  immedi-
ately preceding death come first and so on back through manhood or womanhood
to youth, childhood and infancy.  Everything is remembered.




[PAGE 102]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    The man stands as a spectator before this panorama of his past life.  He
sees  the pictures as they pass and they impress themselves upon his  higher
vehicles,  but he has no feeling about them at this time.   That is reserved
until the time when he enters into the Desire World,  which is the world  of
feeling  and emotion.   At present he is only in the Etheric Region  of  the
Physical World.

    This panorama lasts from a few hours to several days, depending upon the
length of time the man could keep awake, if necessary.  Some people can keep
awake only twelve hours, or even less; others can do so, upon occasion,  for
a  number  of days,  but as long as the man can remain awake,  the  panorama
lasts.

    This  feature  of life after death is similar to that with  takes  place
when one is drowning or falling from a height.  In such cases the vital body
also leaves the dense body and the man sees his life in a flash,  because he
loses consciousness at once.  Of course the "silver cord" is not broken,  or
there could be no resuscitation.

    When the endurance of the vital body has reached its limit, it collapses
in the way described when we were considering the phenomenon of sleep.  Dur-
ing physical life, when the Ego controls its vehicles,  this collapse termi-
nates  the waking hours;  after death the collapse of the vital body  termi-
nates  the  panorama and forces the man to withdraw into the  Desire  World.
The  silver  cord breaks at the point where the sixes unite (see  diagram  5
1/2), and the same division is made as during sleep, but with this important
difference,  that  thought the vital body returns to the dense body,  it  no
longer interpenetrates it,  but simply hovers over it.   It remains floating
over the grave,  decaying synchronously with the dense vehicle.   Hence,  to
the trained clairvoyant, a graveyard is a nauseating sight and if only  more





[PAGE 103]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

people could see it as he does, little argument would be necessary to induce
them  to change from the present unsanitary method of disposing of the  dead
to  the more rational method of cremation,  which restores the  elements  to
their  primordial condition without the objectionable features  incident  to
the process of slow decay.

    In leaving the vital body the process is much the same as when the dense
body is discarded.   The life forces of one atom are taken,  to be used as a
nucleus for the vital body of a future embodiment.  Thus,  upon his entrance
into the Desire World the man has the seed-atoms of the dense and the  vital
bodies, in addition to the desire body and the mind.

    If the dying man could leave all desires behind,  the desire body  would
very quickly fall away from him, leaving him free to proceed into the heaven
world,  but that is not generally the case. Most people,  especially if they
die in the prime of life, have many ties and much interest in life on earth.
They  have not altered their desires because they have lost  their  physical
bodies.   In fact often their desires are even augmented by a  very  intense
longing to return.  This acts in such a manner as to bind them to the Desire
World in a very unpleasant way, although unfortunately,  they do not realize
it.   On the other hand, old and decrepit persons and those who are weakened
by long illness and are tired of life, pass on very quickly.

    The matter may be illustrated by the ease with which the seed falls  out
of  the ripe fruit,  no particle of the flesh clinging to it,  while in  the
unripe fruit the seed clings to the flesh with the greatest tenacity.   Thus
it  is especially hard for people to die who were taken out of their  bodies
by  accident while at the height of their physical health and strength,  en-
gaged in numerous ways in the activities of physical life;  held by the ties




[PAGE 104]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

of wife, family, relatives, friends, pursuits of business and pleasure.

    The suicide, who tries to get away from life, only to find that he is as
much  alive as ever,  is in the most pitiable plight.   He is able to  watch
those whom he has,  perhaps, disgraced by his act, and worst of all,  he has
an unspeakable feeling of being "hollowed out."   The part in the ovoid aura
where  the dense body used to be is empty and although the desire  body  has
taken  the form of the discarded dense body,  it feels like an empty  shell,
because the creative archetype of the body in the Region of Concrete Thought
persists  as an empty mold,  so to speak,  as long as the dense body  should
properly have lived.  When a person meets a natural death, even in the prime
of life,  the activity of the archetype ceases,  and the desire body adjusts
itself  so as to occupy the whole of the form,  but in the case  of  suicide
that awful feeling of "emptiness" remains until the time comes when,  in the
natural course of events, his death would have occurred.

    As  long as the man entertains the desires connected with earth life  he
must stay in his desire body and as the progress of the individual  requires
that  he pass on to higher Regions, the existence in the Desire  World  must
necessarily  become purgative,  tending to purify him from his  binding  de-
sires.  How this is done is best seen by taking some radical instances.

    The miser who loved his gold in earth life loves it just as dearly after
death;  but in the first place he cannot acquire any more, because he has no
longer a dense body wherewith to grasp it and worst of all,  he cannot  even
keep what he hoarded during life.  He will, perhaps,  go and sit by his safe
and watch the cherished gold or bonds; but the heirs appear and with, it may
be, a stinging jeer at the "stingy old fool" (whom they do not see,  but who




[PAGE 105]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

both  sees  and hears them),  will open his safe,  and though he  may  throw
himself over his gold to protect it, they will put their hands through  him,
neither knowing nor caring that he is there,  and will then proceed to spend
his hoard, while he suffers in sorrow and impotent rage.

    He will suffer keenly,  his sufferings all the more terrible on  account
of  being entirely mental,  because the dense body dulls even  suffering  to
some extent.   In the Desire World, however, these sufferings have full sway
and  the  man  suffers until he learns that gold may be a  curse.   Thus  he
gradually  becomes contented with his lot and at last is freed from his  de-
sire body and is ready to go on.

    Or take the case of the drunkard.  He is just as fond of intoxicants af-
ter death as he was before.  It is not the dense body that craves drink.  It
is made sick by alcohol and would rather be without it.   It vainly protests
in different ways,  but the desire body of the drunkard craves the drink and
forces the dense body to take it,  that the desire body may have the  sensa-
tion  of pleasure resulting from the increased vibration.   That desire  re-
mains after the death of the dense body,  but the drunkard has in his desire
body neither mouth to drink not stomach to contain physical liquor.   He may
and does get into saloons,  where he interpolates his body into to bodies of
the drinkers to get a little of their vibrations by induction,  but that  is
too weak to give him much satisfaction.  He may and also does sometimes  get
inside a whiskey cask,  but that is of no avail either for there are in  the
cask  no such fumes as are generated in the digestive organs of  a  tippler.
It has no effect upon him and he is like a man in an open boat on the ocean.
"Water,  water everywhere, but not a drop to drink;" consequently he suffers



[PAGE 106]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

intensely.  In time, however, he learns the uselessness of longing for drink 
which  he cannot obtain.   As with so many of our desires in the Earth life,  
all desires in the Desire World die for want of opportunity to gratify them.  
When the  drunkard  has been purged,  he is ready,  so far as this habit  is  
concerned, to leave  this  state  of  "purgatory" and ascend into the heaven 
world. 

    Thus  we  see that it is not an avenging Deity that makes  purgatory  or
hell for us, but our own individual evil habits and acts.   According to the
intensity  of our desires will be the time and suffering entailed  in  their
expurgation.   In the cases mentioned it would have been no suffering to the
drunkard to lose his worldly possessions.   If he had any,  he did not cling
to them.   Neither would it have caused the miser any paid to have been  de-
prived  of intoxicants.   It is safe to say that he would not have cared  if
there  were not a drop of liquor in the world.   But he did care  about  his
gold, and the drunkard cared about his drink and so the unerring law gave to
each  that which was needed to purge him of his unhallowed desires and  evil
habits.

    This  is the law that is symbolized in the scythe of the reaper,  Death;
the law that says,  "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap."   It
is the law of cause and effect,  which rules all things in the three Worlds,
in every realm of nature--physical, moral and mental.   Everywhere it  works
inexorably,  adjusting all things,  restoring the equilibrium wherever  even
the  slightest action has brought about a disturbance,  as all action  must.
The  result may be manifested immediately or it may be delayed for years  or
for lives, but sometime, somewhere, just and equal retribution will be made.
The student should particularly note that its work is absolutely impersonal.




[PAGE 107]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

There is in the universe neither reward nor punishment.   All is the  result
of invariable law.   The action of this law will be more fully elucidated in
the next chapter,  where we shall find it associated with another Great  Law
of the Cosmos,  which also operates in the evolution of man.  The law we are
now considering is called the law of Consequence.

    In the Desire World it operates in purging man of the baser desires  and
the  correction  of the weaknesses and vices which hinder his  progress,  by
making  him suffer in the manner best adapted to that purpose.   If  he  had
made others suffer, or has dealt unjustly with them, he will be made to suf-
fer in that identical way.   Be it noted, however, that if a person has been
subject to vices,  or has done wrong to others,  but has overcome his vices,
or repented and, as far as possible, made right the wrong done,  such repen-
tance,  reform  and restitution have purged him of those special  vices  and
evil acts.   The equilibrium has been restored and the lesson learned during
that embodiment, and therefore will not b a cause of suffering after death.

    In the Desire World life is lived about three times as rapidly as in the
Physical  World.   A  man  who has lived to be fifty years  of  age  in  the
Physical  World would live through the same life events in the Desire  World
in about sixteen years.   This is, of course,  only a general gauge.   There
are  persons who remain in the Desire World much longer than their  term  of
physical  life.   Others again,  who have led lives with few gross  desires,
pass  through in a much shorter period, but the measure above given is  very
nearly correct for the average man of present day.




[PAGE 108]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION


    It  will be remembered that as the man leaves the dense body  at  death,
his  past  life passes before him in pictures;  but at that time he  has  no
feeling concerning them.

    During his life in the Desire World also these life pictures roll  back-
wards,  as before;  but not the man has all the feelings that it is possible
for him to have as, one by one, the scenes pass before him.   Every incident
in his past life is now lived over again.  When he comes to a point where he
has  injured someone,  he himself feels the pain as the injured person  felt
it.   He lives through all the sorrow and suffering he has caused to  others
and  learns just how painful is the hurt and how hard to bear is the  sorrow
he  has caused.   In addition there is the fact already mentioned  that  the
suffering  is  much keener because he has no dense body to  dull  the  pain.
Perhaps that is why the speed of life there is tripled--that  the  suffering
may lose in duration what it gains in sharpness.  Nature's measures are won-
derfully just and true.

    There  is another characteristic peculiar to this phase of  post  mortem
existence which intimately connected with the fact (already mentioned)  that
distance is almost annihilated in the Desire World.  When a man dies,  he at
once  seems to swell out in his vital body;  he appears to himself  to  grow
into  immense proportions.   This feeling is due to the fact,  not that  the
body really grows, but that the perceptive faculties receive so many impres-
sions from various sources,  all seeming to be close at hand.   The same  is
true  of the desire body.   The man seems to be present with all the  people
with  whom on earth he had relations of a nature which  require  correction.
If he has injured one man in San Francisco and another in New York,  he will
feel as if part of him were in each place.   This gives him a peculiar feel-
ing of being cut to pieces.





[PAGE 109]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

    The  student will now understand the importance of the panorama  of  the
past life during the purgative existence, where this panorama is realized in
definite  feelings.   If it lasted long and the man  were  undisturbed,  the
full,  deep, clear impression etched into the desire body would make life in
the  Desire World more vivid and conscious and the purgation  more  thorough
than if,  because of distress at the loud outbursts of grief on the part  of
his relatives,  at the death bed and during the three-day period  previously
mentioned  the man had only vague impression of his past life.   The  spirit
which  has etched a deep clear record into its desire body will realize  the
mistakes  of the past life so much more clearly and definitely than  if  the
pictures  were  blurred on account of the individual's attention  being  di-
verted  by the suffering and grief around him.   His feeling concerning  the
things  which cause his present suffering in the Desire World will  be  much
more definite if they are drawn from a distinct panoramic impression than if
the duration of the process were short.

    This sharp,  clear-cut feeling is of immense value in future lives.   It
stamps  upon the seed-atom of the desire body an ineffaceable impression  of
itself.   THE  EXPERIENCES WILL BE FORGOTTEN IN SUCCEEDING  LIVES,  BUT  THE
FEELING  REMAINS.   When opportunities occur to repeat the  error  in  later
lives,  this Feeling will speak to us clearly and unmistakably.   It is  the
"still,  small voice"  which warns us,  though we do not know why;  but  the
clearer and more definite the panoramas of past lives has been, the oftener,
stronger and clearer shall we hear this voice.  Thus we see how important it
is  that we leave the passing spirit in absolute quietness after death.   By
so doing we help it to reap the greatest possible benefit from the life just
ended and to avoid perpetuating the same mistakes in future lives, while our




[PAGE 110]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

selfish,  hysterical lamentations may deprive it of much of the value of the
life it has just concluded.

    The mission of purgatory is to eradicate the injurious habits by  making
their  gratification impossible.   The individual suffers exactly as he  has
made others suffer through his dishonesty,  cruelty,  intolerance,  or  what
not.   Because of this suffering he learns to act kindly, honestly, and with
forbearance toward others in future.  Thus,  in consequence of the existence
of this beneficent state,  man learns virtue and right action.   When he  is
reborn he is free from evil habits, at least every evil act committed is one
of free will.   The tendencies to repeat the evil of past lives remain,  for
we  must learn to do right consciously and of our own will.   Upon  occasion
these  tendencies tempt us,  thereby affording us an opportunity of  ranging
ourselves on the side of mercy and virtue as against vice and cruelty.   But
to indicate right action and to help us resist the snares and wiles of temp-
tation,  we have the feeling resulting from the expurgation of  evil  habits
and the expiation of the wrong acts of past lives.   If we heed that feeling
and  abstain from the particular evil involved,  the temptation will  cease.
We have freed ourselves from it for all time.   If we yield we shall experi-
ence  keener suffering than before until at last we have learned to live  by
the Golden Rule, because the way of the transgressor is hard.   Even then we
have not reached the ultimate.  To good to others because we want them to do
good to us is essentially selfish.  In time we must learn to do good REGARD-
LESS of how we are treated by others; as Christ said,  we must love even our
enemies.

    There  is an inestimable benefit in knowing about the method and  object
of this purgation, because we are thus enabled to forestall it by living our




[PAGE 111]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

purgatory  here and now day by day,  thus advancing much faster  than  would
otherwise  be  possible.   An exercise is given in the latter part  of  this
work,  the object of which is purification as an aid to the  development  of
spiritual sight.  It consists of thinking over the happenings of the day af-
ter retiring at night.   We review each incident of the day,  in reverse or-
der,  taking  particular note of the moral aspect,  considering  whether  we
acted  rightly or wrongly in each particular case regarding actions,  mental
attitude and actions, mental attitude and habits.  By thus judging ourselves
day by day, endeavoring to correct mistakes and wrong actions,  we shall ma-
terially  shorten or perhaps even eliminate the necessity for purgatory  and
be able to pass to the first heaven directly after death.   If in this  man-
ner,  we consciously overcome our weaknesses, we also make a  very  material
advance in the school of evolution.  Even if we fail to correct our actions,
we derive an immense benefit from judging ourselves,  thereby generating as-
pirations toward good, which in time will surely bear fruit in right action.

    In  reviewing the day's happenings and blaming ourselves for  wrong,  we
should  not forget to impersonally approve of the good we have done and  de-
termine to do still better.   In this way we enhance the good by approval as
much as we abjure the evil by blame.

    Repentance and reform are also powerful factors in shortening the purga-
torial existence, for nature never wastes effort in useless processes.  When
we realize the wrong of certain habits or acts in our past life,  and deter-
mine to eradicate the habit and to redress the wrong committed,  we are  ex-
punging the pictures of them from the sub-conscious memory and they will not
be there to judge us after death.  Even though  we  are  not  able  to  make




[PAGE 112]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

restitution for a wrong,  the sincerity of our regret will suffice.   Nature
does not aim to "get even," or to take revenge.   Recompense may be given to
our victim in other ways.

    Much  progress ordinarily reserved for future lives will be made by  the
man  who thus takes time by the forelock,  judging himself  and  eradicating
vice  by reforming his character.  This practice is  earnestly  recommended.
It is perhaps the most important teaching in the present work.

                              THE BORDERLAND.

    Purgatory  occupies  the three lower Regions of the Desire  World.   The
first  heaven  is in the upper Regions.  The central Regions is  a  sort  of
borderland--neither heaven nor hell.  In this Region we find people who  are
honest and upright; who wronged no one, but were deeply immersed in business
and  thought  nothing of the higher life.  For them the Desire  World  is  a
state  of the most indescribable monotony.  There is no "business"  in  that
world  nor is there,  for a man of that kind,  anything that will  take  its
place.   He has a very hard time until he learns to think of  higher  things
than  ledgers and drafts.   The men who thought of the problem of  life  and
came to the conclusion that "death ends it all;" who denied the existence of
things outside the material-sense world--these men also feel  this  dreadful
monotony.   They had expected annihilation of consciousness,  but instead of
that they find themselves with an augmented perception of persons and things
about them.   They had been accustomed to denying these things so vehemently
that they often fancy the Desire World an hallucination,  and may frequently
be heard exclaiming in the deepest despair, "When will it end?  When will it
end?"




[PAGE 113]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

    Such people are really in a pitiable state.   They are generally  beyond
the  reach  of any help whatever and suffer much longer than  almost  anyone
else.   Besides, they have scarcely any life in the Heaven world,  where the
building of bodies for future use is taught,  so they put all their crystal-
lizing thoughts into whatsoever body they build for a future life,  and thus
a body is built that has the hardening tendencies we see,  for instance,  in
consumption.   Sometimes the suffering incident to such decrepit bodies will
turn the thoughts of the entities ensouling them to God, and their evolution
can proceed;  but in the materialistic mind lies the greatest danger of los-
ing  touch  with the spirit and becoming an outcast.   Therefore  the  Elder
Brothers  have been very seriously concerned for the last century  regarding
the  fate of the Western World and were it not for their special  beneficent
action  in its behalf,  we should have had a social cataclysm compared  with
which the French Revolution were child's play.   The trained clairvoyant can
see  how narrowly humanity has escaped disasters of a nature so  devastating
that continents would have been swept into the sea.   The reader will find a
more extended and thorough exposition of the connection of materialism  with
volcanic  outbursts  in Chapter XVIII,  where the list of the  eruptions  of
Vesuvius  would seem to corroborate the statement of such a connection,  un-
less  it  is credited to "coincidence," as the sceptic generally  does  when
confronted with facts and figures he cannot explain.

                             THE FIRST HEAVEN.

    When  the purgatorial existence is over the purified spirit  rises  into
the first heaven,  which is located in the three highest Regions of the  De-
sire World,  where  the  results  of  its sufferings are incorporated in the




[PAGE 114]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

seed-atom  of  the desire body,  thus imparting to it the quality  of  right
feeling,  which acts as an impulse to good and a deterrent from evil in  the
future.   Here the panorama of the past again unrolls itself  backward,  but
this  time it is the good acts of life that are the basis of feeling.   When
we  come  to scenes where we helped others we realize anew all  the  joy  of
helping  which  was  ours  at the time, and in  addition  we  feel  all  the
gratitude  poured out to us by the recipient of our help.   When we come  to
scenes where we were helped by others, we again feel all the gratitude  that
we then felt toward our benefactor.   Thus we see the importance of appreci-
ating  the  favors  shown  us  by  others,   because  gratitude  makes   for
soul-growth.   Our happiness in heaven depends upon the joy we gave  others,
and the valuation we placed upon what others did for us.

    It  should be ever borne in mind that the power of giving is not  vested
chiefly  in the monied man.   Indiscriminate giving of money may even be  an
evil.  It is well to give money for a purpose we are convinced is good,  but
service is a thousandfold better.  As Whitman says,

Behold!  I do not give lectures, or a little charity;
When I give, I give myself.

A   kind  look,   expression  of  confidence,   a  sympathetic  and   loving
helpfulness--these  can be given by all regardless of wealth.  Moreover,  we
should particularly endeavor to help the needy one to help himself,  whether
physically,  financially,  morally, or mentally, and not cause him to become
dependent upon us or others.

    The ethics of giving,  with the effect on the giver as a spiritual  les-
son,  are  most beautifully shown in Lowell's "The Vision of  Sir  Launfal."
The young and ambitious knight,  Sir Launfal,  clad  in  shining  armor  and




[PAGE 115]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

astride a splendid charger,  is setting out from his castle to seek The Holy
Grail.  On his shield gleams the cross, the symbol of the benignity and ten-
derness  of Our Savior,  the meek and lowly One,  but the knight's heart  is
filled  with pride and haughty disdain for the poor and needy.   He meets  a
leper  asking alms and with a contemptuous frown throws him a coin,  as  one
might cast a bone to a hungry cur, but

The leper raised not the gold from the dust,
"Better to me the poor man's crust,
Better the blessing of the poor,
Though I turn empty from his door.
That is not true alms which the hand can hold;
He gives only worthless gold
Who gives from a send of duty;
But he who gives from a slender mite,
And gives to that which is out of sight--
That thread of all-sustaining Beauty
Which runs through all and doth all unite,--
The hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms,
The heart outstretches its eager palms,
For a god goes with it and makes it store
To the soul that was starving in darkness before.

    On his return sir Launfal finds another in possession of his castle, and
is driven from the gate.

An old bent man, worn out and frail,
He came back from seeking the Holy Grail;
Little he recked of his earldom's loss,
No more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross,
But deep in his heart the sign he wore,
The badge of the suffering and the poor.

    Again he meets the leper, who again asks alms.  This time the knight re-
sponds differently.

And Sir Launfal said:  "I behold in thee
An image of Him Who died on the tree;
Thou also hast had they crown of thorns,
Thou also hast had the world's buffets and scorns,




[PAGE 116]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION


And to thy life were not denied
The wounds in the hands and feet and side;
Mild Mary's Son, acknowledge me;
Behold, through him I give to Thee!"

    A look in the leper's eye brings remembrance and recognition, and

The heart within him was ashes and dust;
He parted in twain his single crust,
He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,
And gave the leper to eat and drink.

    A transformation takes place:

The leper no longer crouched by his side,
But stood before him glorified,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

And the Voice that was softer that silence said,
"Lo, it is I, be not afraid!
In many lands, without avail,
Thou has spent thy life for the Holy Grail;
Behold, it is here!--This cup which thou
Did'st fill at the streamlet for me but now;
This crust is by body broken for thee,
This water the blood I shed on the tree;
The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,
In whatso we share with another's need;
Not what we five, but what we share--
For the gift without the giver is bare;
Who gives himself with his alms feeds three--
Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me."

    The first heaven is a place of joy without a single drop of  bitterness.
The spirit is beyond the influence of the material, earthly conditions,  and
assimilates  all  the good contained in the past life as it  lives  it  over
again.  Here all ennobling pursuits to which the man aspired are realized in
fullest measure.   It is a place of rest,  and the harder has been the life,
the more keenly will rest be enjoyed.   Sickness,  sorrow,  and pain are un-
known quantities.   This is the Summerland of the spiritualists.  There  the
thoughts  of  the  devout  Christian   have   built   the   New   Jerusalem.




[PAGE 117]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

Beautiful houses,  flowers,  etc.,  are the portion of those who aspired  to
them;  they build them themselves by thought from the subtle  desire  stuff.
Nevertheless these things are just as real and tangible to them as our mate-
rial  houses  are to us.   All gain here the satisfaction which  earth  life
lacked for them.

    There  is  one class there who lead a particularly  beautiful  life--the
children.  If we could but see them we would quickly cease our grief.   When
a  child dies before the birth of the desire body,  which takes place  about
the  fourteenth year,  it does not go any higher than the first heaven,  be-
cause it is not responsible for its actions,  any more than the unborn child
is responsible for the pain it causes the mother by turning and twisting  in
her womb.  Therefore the child has not purgatorial existence.  That which is
not quickened cannot die,  hence the desire body of a child,  together  with
the mind,  will persist until a new birth, and for that reason such children
are very apt to remember their previous life as instanced in the case  cited
elsewhere.

    For  such children the first heaven is a waiting-place where they  dwell
from one to twenty years,  until an opportunity for a new birth is  offered.
Yet it is more than simply a waiting-place,  because there is much  progress
made during this interim.

    When a child dies there is always some relative awaiting it, or, failing
that there are people who loved to "mother"  children in the earth life  who
find delight in taking care of a little waif.  The extreme plasticity of the
desire  stuff makes it easy to form the most exquisite living toys  for  the
children,  and their life is one beautiful play; nevertheless their instruc-
tion is not neglected.  They are formed into classes according to their tem-
peraments, but  quite regardless of age.   In the Desire World it is easy to




[PAGE 118]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

give  object-lessons in the influence of good and evil passions  on  conduct
and happiness.   These lessons are indelibly imprinted upon the child's sen-
sitive and emotional desire body, and remain with it after rebirth,  so that
many a one living a noble life owes much of it to the fact that he was given
this  training.   Often when a weak spirit is born,  the Compassionate  ones
(the  invisible  Leaders who guide our evolution) cause it to die  in  early
life that it may have this extra training to fit it for what may be  perhaps
a  hard life.   This seems to be the case particularly where the etching  on
the  desire body was weak in consequence of a dying person having been  dis-
turbed by the lamentations of his relatives, or because he met death by  ac-
cident or on the battle-field.  He did not under those circumstances experi-
ence  the  appropriate intensity of feeling in his  POST MORTEM   existence,
therefore,  when  he is born and dies early life,  the loss is  made  us  as
above.   Often the duty of caring for such a child in the heaven life  falls
to those who were the cause of the anomaly.  They are thus afforded a chance
to  make up for the fault and to learn better.   Or perhaps they become  the
parents  of  the  one they harmed and care for it during the  few  years  it
lives.   It  does not matter then if they do lament  hysterically  over  its
death,  because there would be no pictures of any consequence in  a  child's
vital body.

    This heaven is also a place of progression for all who have been  studi-
ous,  artistic, or altruistic.  The student and the philosopher have instant
access to all the libraries of the world.   The painter has endless  delight
in ever-changing color combinations.  He soon learns that his thought blends
and shapes these colors at will.   His creations glow and scintillate with a
life  impossible of attainment to one works with the dull pigments of Earth.




[PAGE 119]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

He is,  as it were,  painting with living, glowing materials and able to ex-
ecute  his designs with a facility which fills his soul with  delight.   The
musician has not yet reached the place where his art will express itself  to
the fullest extent.   The Physical World is the world of FORM.   The  Desire
World,  where we find purgatory and the first heaven,  is  particularly  the
world of COLOR.;  but the World of Thought, where the second and third heav-
ens are located, is the sphere of TONE.  Celestial music is a fact and not a
mere figure of speech.  Pythagoras was not romancing when spoke of the music
of the spheres,  for each one of the heavenly orbs has its definite tone and
together they sound the celestial symphony which Goethe also mentions in the
prolog  to his "Faust,"  where the scene is laid in heaven.   The  Archangel
Raphael says,

The Sun intones his ancient song
    'Mid rival chant of brother spheres.
His prescribed course he speeds along
    In thund'rous way throughout the years.

    Echoes of that heavenly music reach us even here in the Physical  World.
They are our most precious possession,  even though they are as elusive as a
will-o'-the-wisp,  and cannot be permanently created,  as can other works of
art--a statue,  a painting, or a book.  In the Physical World tone dies  and
vanishes the moment after it is born.  In the first heaven these echoes are,
of course, much more beautiful and have more permanency, hence there the mu-
sician hears sweeter strains than ever he did during earth life.

    The experiences of the poet are akin to those of the musician,  for  po-
etry  is the soul's expression of it innermost feelings in words  which  are
ordered according to the same laws of harmony and  rhythm  that  govern  the




[PAGE 120]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

outpouring of the spirit in music.  In addition,  the poet finds a wonderful
inspiration  in the pictures and colors which are the chief  characteristics
of the Desire World.   Thence he will draw the material for use in his  next
incarnation.   In like manner does the author accumulate material  and  fac-
ulty.   The philanthropist works out his altruistic plans for the upliftment
of  man.   If he failed in one life,  he will see the reason for it  in  the
first  heaven and will there learn how to overcome the obstacles  and  avoid
the errors that made his plan impracticable.

    In  time a point is reached where the result of the pain  and  suffering
incident to purgation, together with the joy extracted from the good actions
of  the past life,  have been built into the seed-atom of the  desire  body.
Together  these  constitute what we call conscience,  that  impelling  force
which  warns  us against evil as productive of pain and inclines  us  toward
good as productive of happiness and joy.  Then man leaves his desire body to
disintegrate,  as he left his dense body and vital body.   He takes with him
the  forces only of the seed-atom,  which are to form the nucleus of  future
desire  bodies,  as it was the persistent particle of his past  vehicles  of
feeling.

    As stated above, the forces of the seed-atom are withdrawn.   To the ma-
terialist  force and matter are inseparable.   The occultist  knows  differ-
ently.  To him they are not two entirely distinct and separate concepts, but
the two poles of one spirit.

    MATTER is crystallized spirit.
    FORCE is the same spirit not yet crystallized.

    This has been said before,  but it cannot be too strongly impressed upon
the mind.  In this connection the illustration of the snail is very helpful.
Matter,  which  is  crystallized  spirit,  corresponds to the snail's house,




[PAGE 121]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

which is crystallized snail.  The chemical force which moves matter,  making
it  available for the building of form, and the snail which moves its  house
are also good correspondences.  That which is now the snail will in time be-
come the house,  and that which is now force will in time become matter when
it has crystallized further.   The reverse process of resolving matter  back
into spirit is also going on continually.  The coarser phase of this process
we  see as decay when a man is leaving his vehicles behind and at that  time
the spirit of an atom is easily detachable from the coarser spirit which has
been manifesting as matter.

                             THE SECOND HEAVEN

    At  last  the  man,  the Ego, the threefold spirit,  enters  the  second
heaven.   He  is  clad  in the sheath of  mind,  which  contains  the  three
seed-atoms--the quintessence of the three discarded vehicles.

    When the man dies and loses his dense and vital bodies there is the same
condition as when one falls asleep.  The desire body, as has been explained,
has no organs ready for use.   It is now transformed from an ovoid to a fig-
ure resembling the dense body which has been abandoned.   We can easily  un-
derstand that there must be an interval of unconsciousness resembling  sleep
and then the man awakes in the Desire World.   It not infrequently  happens,
however, that such people are, for a long time, unaware of what has happened
to them.   They do not realize that they have died.  They know that they are
able to move and think.  It is sometimes even a very hard matter to get them
to believe that they are really "dead."  They realize that something is dif-
ferent, but they are not able to understand what it is.




[PAGE 122]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    Not so, however, when the change is made from the first heaven, which is
in the Desire World,  to the second heaven,  which is in the Region of  Con-
crete Thought.   Then the man leaves his desire body.   He is perfectly con-
scious.   He passes into a great stillness.   For the time being  everything
seems  to fade away.   He cannot think.  No faculty is alive,  yet he  knows
that he IS.  He has a feeling of standing in "The Great Forever;"  of stand-
ing  utterly alone,  yet unafraid;  and his soul is filled with a  wonderful
peace, "which passeth all understanding."

    In occult science this is called "THE GREAT SILENCE."

    Then comes the awakening.  The spirit is now in its  home-World--heaven.
Here the first awakening brings to the spirit the sound of "the music of the
spheres."   In  our Earth life we are so immersed in the little  noises  and
sounds of our limited environment that we are incapable of hearing the music
of the marching orbs, but the occult scientist hears it.   He knows that the
twelve signs of the Zodiac and the seven planets from the sounding-board and
strings of "Apollo's seven-stringed lyre."  He knows that were a single dis-
cord to mar the celestial harmony from that grand Instrument there would  be
"a wreck of matter and a crash of worlds."

    The power of rhythmic vibration is well known to all who have given  the
subject even the least study.  For instance, soldiers are commanded to break
step  when crossing a bridge,  otherwise their rhythmic tramp would  shatter
the strongest structure.   The Bible story of the sounding of the ram's horn
while marching around the walls of the city of Jericho is not nonsensical in
the eyes of the occultist.  In some cases similar things have happened with-
out the world smiling in supercilious incredulity.   A few years ago, a band




[PAGE 123]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

of musicians were practicing in a garden close to the very solid wall of  an
old castle.   There occurred at a certain place in the music a prolonged and
very piercing tone.   When this note was sounded the wall of the castle sud-
denly  fell.   The musicians has struck the keynote of the wall and  it  was
sufficiently prolonged to shatter it.

    When it is said that this is the world of tone,  it must not be  thought
that there are no colors.   Many people know that there is an intimate  con-
nection between color and tone;  than when a certain note is struck,  a cer-
tain  color  appears simultaneously.   So it is also in  the  Heaven  World.
Color  and  sound are both present;  but the tone is the originator  of  the
color.   Hence it is said, that this is particularly the world of tone,  and
it is this tone that builds all forms in the Physical World.   The  musician
can hear certain tones in different parts of nature, such as the wind in the
forest, the breaking of the surf on the beach, the roar of the ocean and the
sounding  of many waters.   These combined tones make a whole which  is  the
key-note of the Earth--its "tone."    As geometrical figures are created  by
drawing a violin bow over the edge of a glass plate containing sand,  so the
forms we see around us are the crystallized sound-figures of the  archetypal
forces which play into the archetypes in the Heaven World.

    The  work done my man is the Heaven World is many-sided.   It is not  in
the least an inactive,  dreamy not illusory existence.   It is a time of the
greatest  and  most important activity in preparing for the  next  life,  as
sleep is an active preparation for the work of the following day.

    Here  the quintessence of the three bodies is built into  the  threefold
spirit.  As much of the desire body  as the man had worked upon during life,




[PAGE 124]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

by purifying his desires and emotions, will be welded into the human spirit,
thus giving an improved mind in the future.

    As  much  of the vital body as the life spirit had worked  upon,  trans-
formed,  spiritualized,  and thus saved from the decay to which the rest  of
the vital body is subject,  will be amalgamated with the life spirit to  in-
sure a better vital body and temperament in the succeeding lives.

    As much of the dense body as the divine spirit has save by right  action
will be worked into it and will bring better environment and opportunities.

    The  spiritualization of the vehicle is accomplished by  cultivation  of
the faculties of observation,  discrimination and memory,  devotion to  high
ideals, prayer, concentration, persistence and right use of the life forces.

    The second heaven is the real home of man--the  Ego, the Thinker.   Here
he dwells for centuries,  assimilating the fruit of the last earth life  and
preparing the earthly conditions which will be best suited for his next step
in progress.   The sound or tone which pervades this Region,  and is  every-
where apparent as color, is his instrument, so to speak.   It is this harmo-
nious sound vibration which, as an elixir of life, builds into the threefold
spirit  the quintessence of the threefold body,  upon which it  depends  for
growth.

    The  life in the second heaven is an exceedingly active one,  varied  in
many different ways.   The Ego assimilates the fruits of the last earth life
and prepares the environment for a new physical existence.  It is not enough
to  say that the new conditions will be determined by conduct and action  in
the life just closed.   It is required that the fruits of the past be worked
into  the World which is to be the next scene of activity while the  Ego  is
gaining  fresh physical experiences and gathering further fruit.   Therefore
all the denizens of the Heaven World work upon the models of the Earth,  all




[PAGE 125]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

of  which are in the Region of Concrete Thought.   They alter  the  physical
features  of the Earth,  and bring about the gradual changes which vary  its
appearance,  so that on each return to physical life a different environment
has been prepared, wherein new experiences may be gained.   Climate,  FLORA,
and FAUNA are altered by man under the direction of higher Beings, to be de-
scribed later.   Thus the world is just what we ourselves,  individually and
collectively, have made it; and it will be what we make it.  The occult sci-
entist  sees  in  everything  that happens a cause  of  a  spiritual  nature
manifesting  itself,  not omitting the prevalence and alarmingly  increasing
frequency  of  seismic disturbances,  which it traces to  the  materialistic
thought of modern science.

    It  is  true that purely physical causes can bring  about  such  distur-
bances,  but is that the last word on the subject?   Can we always  get  the
full  explanation by merely recording what appears on the  surface?   Surely
not!   We see two men conversing on the street and one suddenly strikes  the
other,  knocking him down.   One observer may say that an angry knocked  the
man down.   Another may scoff at this answer and declare that he saw the arm
lifted,  the muscles contract,  the arm shooting out and coming  in  contact
with the victim, who was knocked down.  That is also true, but it is safe to
say that had there not FIRST been the angry thought, the blow would not have
been struck.   In like manner the occultist says that if materialism had not
been, seismic disturbances would not have occurred.

    Man's work in the Heaven World is not confined solely to the alternation
of the surface of the Earth which is to be the scene of his future struggles
in  the  subjugation  of the Physical World.  He is also actively engaged in




[PAGE 126]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

learning  how to build a body which shall afford a better means  of  expres-
sion.  It is man's destiny to become a Creative Intelligence and he is serv-
ing his apprenticeship all the time.   During his heaven life he is learning
to build all kinds of bodies--the human included.

    We have spoken of the forces which work along the positive and  negative
poles  of the different ethers.   MAN HIMSELF IS PART OF THAT FORCE.   Those
whom we call dead are the ones who help us to live.  They in turn are helped
by the so-called "nature spirits,"  which they command.   Man is directed in
this work by Teachers from the higher creative Hierarchies, which helped him
to build his vehicles before he attained self-consciousness, in the same way
he  himself now builds his bodies in sleep.   During heaven life they  teach
him consciously.  The painter is taught to build an accurate eye, capable of
taking in a perfect perspective and of distinguishing colors and shades to a
degree inconceivable among those not interested in color and light.

    The mathematician has to deal with space, and the faculty for space per-
ception is connected with the delicate adjustment of the three semi-circular
canals which are situated inside the ear, each pointing in one of the  three
dimensions in space.   Logical thought and mathematical ability are in  pro-
portion  to  the accuracy of the adjustment of these  semi-circular  canals.
Musical ability is also dependent upon the same factor,  but in addition  to
the  necessity for the proper adjustment of the  semi-circular  canals,  the
musician requires extreme delicacy of the "fibres of Corti,"  of which there
are about ten thousand in the human ear,  each capable of interpreting about
twenty-five gradations of tone.   In the ears of the majority of people they
do not respond to more than from  three  to  ten of the possible gradations.




[PAGE 127]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

Among  ordinary  musical people the greatest degree of efficiency  is  about
fifteen sounds to each fivre; but the master musician, who is able to inter-
pret and bring down music from the Heaven World, requires a greater range to
be able to distinguish the different notes and detect the slightest  discord
in the most complicated chords.   Persons who require organs of such exceed-
ing delicacy for the expression of their faculties are specially taken  care
of, as the higher state of their development merits and demands.  None other
ranks  so high as the musician,  which is reasonable when we  consider  that
while the painter draws his inspiration chiefly from the world of color--the
nearer Desire World--the musician attempts to bring us the atmosphere of our
heavenly home world (where,  as spirits, we are citizens),  and to translate
them into the sounds of earth life.  His is the highest mission,  because as
a  mode of expression for soul life,  music reigns supreme.   That music  is
different from and higher than all the other arts can be understood when  we
reflect  that a statue or painting, when once created,  is permanent.   They
are drawn from the Desire World and are therefore more easily  crystallized,
while music,  being of the Heaven World, is more elusive and must be re-cre-
ated each time we hear it.  It cannot be imprisoned,  as shown by the unsuc-
cessful  attempts to do so partially by means of such mechanical devices  as
phonographs  and piano-players.   The music so reproduced loses much of  the
soul-stirring sweetness it possesses when it comes fresh from its own world,
carrying  to the soul memories of its home and speaking to it in a  language
that no beauty expressed in marble or upon canvas can equal.

    The instrument through which man senses music is the most perfect  sense
organ in the human body.  The eye is not by any means true,  but the ear is,




[PAGE 128]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

in the sense that it hears every sound without distortion, while the eye of-
ten distorts what it sees.

    In addition to the musical ear,  the musician must also learn to build a
long,  fine  hand with slender fingers and sensitive  nerves,  otherwise  he
would not be able to reproduce the melodies he hears.

    It is a law of nature that no one can inhabit a more efficient body that
he is capable of building.  He first learns to build a certain grade of body
and  afterwards he learns to live in it.   In that way he discovers its  de-
fects and is taught how to remedy them.

    All  men  work  unconsciously at the building  of  their  bodies  during
ante-natal life until they have reached the point where the quintessence  of
former bodies--which they have saved--is to be built in. Then they work con-
sciously.   It will therefore be seen that the more a man advances  and  the
more he works on his vehicles, thus making them immortal,  the more power he
has to build for a new life.   The advanced pupil of an occult school  some-
times  commences to build for himself as soon as the work during  the  first
three  weeks (which belongs exclusively to the mother) has  been  completed.
When  the period of unconscious building has passed the man has a chance  to
exercise  his  nascent  creative  power,  and  the  true  original  creative
process--"Epigenesis"--begins.

    Thus  we see that man learns to BUILD his vehicles in the Heaven  World,
and to use them in the Physical World.   Nature provides all phases of expe-
rience in such a marvelous manner and with such consummate wisdom that as we
learn  to  see deeper and deeper into her secrets we are more and  more  im-
pressed  with our own insignificance and with an ever-growing reverence  for
God, whose visible symbol nature is.  The  more we learn of her wonders, the




[PAGE 129]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

more we realize that this world system is not the vast perpetual motion  ma-
chine unthinking people would have us believe.  It would be quite as logical
to  think  that if we toss a box of loose type into the air  the  characters
will have arranged themselves into the words of a beautiful poem by the time
they reach the ground.   The greater the complexity of the plan the  greater
the  argumental weight in favor of the theory of an intelligent  Divine  Au-
thor.

                              THE THIRD HEAVEN

    Having  assimilated all the fruits of his last life and altered the  ap-
pearance of the Earth in such a manner as to afford him the necessary  envi-
ronment for his next step towards perfection; having also learned by work on
the bodies of others, to build a suitable body through which to express him-
self in the Physical World and having at last resolved the mind into the es-
sence  which builds the three-fold spirit,  the naked individual spirit  as-
cends  into  the  higher  Region  of the World of Thought--the third heaven, 
Here, by the ineffable harmony of this higher world,  it is strengthened for
its next dip into matter.

    After  a time comes the desire for new experience and the  contemplation
of a new birth.   This conjures up a series of pictures before the vision of
the  spirit--a panorama  of the new life in store for it.   But,  mark  this
well--this panorama contains only principal events. The spirit has free will
as  to detail.   It is as if a man going to a distant city had a  time-limit
ticket,  with initial choice of route.   After he has chosen and  begun  his
journey it is not sure that he can change to another route during the  trip.
He may stop over in as many places as he wishes, within his time limit,  but
he cannot go back.  Thus as he proceeds on his journey,  he becomes more and





[PAGE 130]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

more limited by his past choice.  If he had chosen a steam road,  using soft
coal,  he must expect to be soiled and dusty.   Had he chosen a road burning
anthracite or using electricity he would have been cleaner.   So it is  with
the man in a new life.   He may have to live a hard life,  but he is free to
choose whether he will live it cleanly or wallow in the mire.   Other condi-
tions are also within his control, subject to limits of his past choices and
acts.

    The pictures in the panorama of the coming life,  of which we have  just
spoken,  begin at the cradle and end at the grave.  This is the opposite di-
rection  to that in which they travel in the after-death  panorama,  already
explained,  which passes before the vision of the spirit immediately follow-
ing its release from the dense body.  The reason for this radical difference
in  the two panoramas is that in the before-birth panorama the object is  to
show the returning Ego how certain CAUSES or acts always PRODUCE certain EF-
FECTS.   In the case of the after-death panorama the object is the  reverse,
i.e.,  to show how each event in the past life was the EFFECT of some  CAUSE
further back in the life.   Nature,  or God,  does nothing without a logical
reason,  and the further we search the more apparent it becomes to  us  that
Nature is a wise mother, always using the best means to accomplish her ends.

    But  it may be asked,  Why should we be reborn?   Why must we return  to
this  limited and miserable earth existence?  Why can we not get  experience
in  those  higher  realms without coming to Earth?   We are  tired  of  this
dreary, weary earth life!

    Such queries are based upon misunderstandings of several kinds.   In the
first  place,  let us realize and engrave it deep upon the  tablets  of  our
memory that THE PURPOSE OF LIFE IS NOT  HAPPINESS,  BUT  EXPERIENCE.  Sorrow




[PAGE 131]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

and  pain are our most benevolent teachers, while the joys of life  are  but
fleeting.

    This seems a stern doctrine and the heart cries out passionately at even
the  thought that it may possibly be true.   Nevertheless,  it is true,  and
upon examination it will be found not such a stern doctrine after all.

    Consider the blessings of pain.   If we could place our hand upon a  hot
stove  and feel no pain,  the hand might be allowed to remain until  it  and
perhaps the arm were burned away,  without our knowing anything about it un-
til too late to save them.   It is the pain resulting from the contact  with
the hot stove  which makes us snatch our hand away before serious damage  is
done.   Instead of losing the hand,  we escape with a blister which  quickly
heals.   This is an illustration from the Physical World.  We find that same
principle  applies in the Moral and Mental Worlds.   If we outrage  morality
the  pangs of conscience bring us pain that will prevent us  from  repeating
the act and if we do not heed the first lesson,  nature will give us  harder
and harder experiences until at last the fact is forced into our  conscious-
ness that "the way of the transgressor is hard."   This will continue  until
at last we are forced to turn in a new direction and take a step onward  to-
ward a better life.

    Experience is "knowledge of the effects which follow acts."  This is the
object of life,  together with the development of "Will," which is the force
whereby we apply the results of experience.  Experience must be gained,  but
we  have the choice whether we gain it by the hard path of personal  experi-
ence  or  by observation of other people's acts,  reasoning  and  reflecting
thereon, guided by the light of whatever experience we have already had.





[PAGE 132]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    This is the method by which the occult student should learn,  instead of
requiring the lash of adversity and pain.  The more willing we are to  learn
in  that  way,  the less we shall feel the stinging thorns of "the  path  of
pain" and the more quickly shall we gain "the path of peace."

    The choice is ours,  but so long as we have not learned all there is  to
learn in this world,  we must come back to it.  We cannot stay in the higher
worlds  and  learn there until we have mastered the lessons of  earth  life.
That would be as sensible as to send a child to kindergarten one day and  to
college the next.   The child must return to the kindergarten day after  day
and  spend years in the grammar school and the high school before its  study
has developed its capacity sufficiently to enable it to understand the  les-
sons taught in college.

    Man  is also in school--the school of experience.  He must  return  many
times before he can hope to master all the knowledge in the world of  sense.
No one earth life, however rich in experience,  could furnish the knowledge,
so nature decrees that he must return to Earth, after intervals of rest,  to
take  up his work where he dropped it, exactly as a child takes up its  work
in school each day,  after the intervening sleep of night.   It is not argu-
ment against this theory to say that man does not remember his former lives.
We cannot recall all the events of our present lives.   We do not  recollect
our labors in learning to write, yet we have acquired a knowledge of the art
of writing,  which proves that we did learn.   All the faculties we  possess
are a proof that we acquired them sometime,  somewhere.   Some people do re-
member their past,  however,  as a remarkable instance related at the end of
the next chapter will show, and is but one among many.

    Again, if their were no return to Earth, what is the use of living?  Why




[PAGE 133]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

strive for anything?  Why should a life of happiness in an eternal heaven be
the reward for a good life?   What benefit could come from a good life in  a
heaven where everybody is already happy?  Surely in a place where  everybody
is happy and contented there is no need for sympathy, self-sacrifice or wise
counsel!   No one would need them here; but on Earth there are many who need
those very things and such humanitarian and altruistic qualities are of  the
greatest  service  to struggling humanity.  Therefore the Great  Law,  which
works for Good,  brings man back to work again in the world for the  benefit
to himself and others, with his acquired treasures,  instead of letting them
go to waste in a heaven where no one needs them.

                          PREPARATIONS FOR REBIRTH

    Having  thus seen the necessity for repeated embodiments,  we will  next
consider the method by which this purpose is accomplished.

    Previous to taking the dip into matter,  the threefold spirit is  naked,
having  only the forces of the four seed-atoms (which are the nuclei of  the
threefold body and the sheath of mind).   Its descent resembles the  putting
on of several pairs of gloves of increasing thickness,  as previously illus-
trated.  The forces of the mind of the last life are awakened from their la-
tency in the seed-atom.  This begins to attract to itself materials from the
highest subdivision of the Region of Concrete Thought,  in a manner  similar
to that in which a magnet draws to itself iron filings.

    If we hold a magnet over a miscellaneous heap of filings of brass,  sil-
ver,  gold,  iron, lead and other metals, we shall find that it selects only
iron filings and that even of them it will  take no  more  than its strength




[PAGE 134]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

enables it to lift.   Its attractive power is of a certain kind and is  lim-
ited to a certain quantity of that kind.  The same is true of the seed-atom.
It can take, in each Region, nothing except the material for which it has an
affinity and nothing beyond a certain definite quantity even of that.   Thus
the  vehicle built around this nucleus becomes an exact counterpart  of  the
corresponding vehicle of the last life minus the evil which has been  expur-
gated  and plus the quintessence of good which has been incorporated in  the
seed-atom.

    The material selected by the threefold spirit forms itself into a  great
bell-shaped  figure,  open at the bottom and with the seed-atom at the  top.
If  we conceive of the illustration spiritually we may compare it to a  div-
ing-bell  descending  into a sea composed of fluids of  increasing  density.
These  correspond to the different subdivisions of each World.   The  matter
taken into the texture of the bell-shaped body makes it heavier,  so that it
sinks  into  the next lower subdivision and it takes from  that  its  proper
quota of matter.   Thus it becomes still heavier and sinks yet deeper  until
it  has  passed  through the four subdivisions of  the  Region  of  Concrete
Thought  and  the sheath of the new mind of the man is complete.   Next  the
forces in the seed-atom of the desire body are awakened.   It places  itself
at the top of the bell,  INSIDE,  and the materials of the seventh Region of
the Desire World draw around it until it sinks to the sixth Region,  getting
more  material there,  and this process continues until the first Region  of
the Desire World is reached.  The bell has now two layers-the sheath of mind
outside and the new desire body inside.

    The seed-atom of the vital body is next aroused into activity,  but here
the  process of information is not so simple as in the case of the mind  and
the  desire  body,  for  it  must  be  remembered  that  those vehicles were




[PAGE 135]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

comparatively unorganized,  while the vital body and the dense body are more
organized and very complicated.  The material, of a given quantity and qual-
ity, is attracted in the same manner and under the operation of the same law
as  in the case of the higher bodies, but the building of the new  body  and
the placement in the proper environment is done by four great Beings of  im-
measurable wisdom,  which are the Recording Angels,  the "Lords of Destiny."
They  impress the reflecting ether of the vital body in such a way that  the
pictures  of the coming life are reflected in it.   It (the vital  body)  is
built  by the inhabitants of the Heaven World and the elemental  spirits  in
such a manner as to form a particular type of brain.  But mark this, THE RE-
TURNING EGO ITSELF INCORPORATES THEREIN THE QUINTESSENCE OF ITS FORMER VITAL
BODIES  AND IN ADDITION TO THIS ALSO DOES A LITTLE ORIGINAL WORK.   This  is
done that in the coming life there  may be some room for original and  indi-
vidual expression, not predetermined by past action.

    It is very important to remember this fact.   There is too great a  ten-
dency  to  think that all which now exists is the result of  something  that
previously existed,  but if that were the case there would be no margin left
for new and original effort and for new causes.   The chain of cause and ef-
fect is not a monotonous repetition.  THERE IS AN INFLUX OF NEW AND ORIGINAL
CAUSES ALL THE TIME.  That is the real backbone of evolution--the only thing
that  gives it meaning and makes it other than an unrolling of latent  actu-
alities.  This is "Epigenesis"--the free-will that consists of  the  freedom
the  inaugurate  something entirely new,  not merely a  choice  between  two
courses of action.  This is the important factor which alone can explain the
system  to  which  we  belong  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  Involution  and




[PAGE 136]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Evolution is themselves are insufficient; but coupled with Epignesis we have
a full triad of explanation.

    The fate of an individual generated under the law of Consequence,  is of
great  complexity and involves association with Egos in and out of  physical
existence, at all times.  Even those living at one time may not be living in
the same locality,  so that it is impossible for one individual's destiny to
be  all  worked out in one lifetime or in one place.  The Ego  is  therefore
brought into a certain environment and family with which it is some way  re-
lated.   As regards the fate to be worked out,  it is  sometimes  immaterial
into which one of several environmental the Ego is reborn,  and when such is
the case, it is allowed its choice as far as possible, but once an Ego is so
placed the agents of the Lords of Destiny watch unseen,  that no act of free
will shall frustrate the working out of the portion of fate selected.  If we
do aught of such as to circumvent that part, they will make another move, so
as  to enforce fulfillment of the destiny.   It cannot be too often  reiter-
ated,  however,  that this does not render man helpless.   It is merely  the
same law that governs after we have fired a pistol.   We are then unable  to
stop the bullet, or even to deflect it from its course in any way.   Its di-
rection was determined by the position in which the pistol was held when  we
fired.   That  could have been changed at any time before  the  trigger  was
pulled,  as up to that time we had full control.  The same is true regarding
new  actions  which make future destiny.   We may,  up to a  certain  point,
modify  or even altogether counteract certain causes already set in  motion,
but once started, and no further action taken, they will get beyond our con-
trol.   This is called "ripe" fate and it is this kind that is meant when it
is  said  that  the  Lords of Destiny check every attempt to shirk it.  With





[PAGE 137]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

regard to out past we are to a great extent helpless,  but in regard to  fu-
ture action we have full control,  except insofar as we are hampered by  our
past actions.   By and by, however, as we learn that we are the cause of our
own  sorrow or joy,  we shall awake to the necessity of ordering  our  lives
more  in harmony with the laws of God and thus rise above these laws of  the
Physical World.  That is the key to emancipation; as Goethe says:

                From every power that all the world enchains
                Man frees himself when self-control he gains.

    The vital body,  having been molded by the Lords of Destiny,  will  give
form to the dense body,  organ of organ.  This matrix or mold is then placed
in  the womb of the future mother.   The seed-atom for the dense body is  in
the  triangular head of one of the spermatozoa in the semen of  the  father.
This  alone makes fertilization possible and here is the explanation of  the
fact  that  so  many times sex-unions are  unfruitful.   The  chemical  con-
stituents  of  the seminal fluid and the ova are the same at all  times  and
were these the only requirements,  the explanation of the phenomenon of  in-
fertility,  if  sought in the material, visible world alone,  would  not  be
found.   It becomes plain, however, when we understand that as the molecules
of  water freeze only along the lines of force in the water and manifest  as
ice  crystals instead of freezing into a homogeneous mass,  as would be  the
case if there were no lines of force previous to coagulation,  so there  can
be no dense body built until there is a vital body in which to build the ma-
terial;  also there must be a seed-atom for the dense body,  to act as gauge
of  the  quality and quantity of the matter which is to be built  into  that
dense body.  Although  at  the  present  stage of development there is never





[PAGE 138]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

full harmony in the materials of the body, because that would mean a perfect
body, yet the discord must not be so great as to be disruptive of the organ-
ism.

    Thus while heredity in the first place is true only as regards the mate-
rial of the dense body and not the soul qualities,  which are entirely indi-
vidual,  the  incoming Ego also does a certain amount of work on  its  dense
body,  incorporating in it the quintessence of its past physical  qualities.
No  body is an exact mixture of the qualities of its parents,  although  the
Ego  is restricted to the use of the materials taken from the bodies of  the
father and mother.   Hence a musician incarnates where he can get the  mate-
rial to build the slender hand and the delicate ear,  with it sensitive  fi-
bres of Corti and its accurate adjustment of the three semicircular  canals.
The arrangement of these materials, however, is, to the extent named,  under
the  control of the Ego.   It is as though a carpenter were given a pile  of
boards to use in building a house in which to live,  but is left to his  own
judgement as to the kind of house he wishes to build.

    Except  in the case of a very highly developed being,  this work of  the
Ego  is  almost  negligible at the present stage of  man's  evolution.   The
greatest scope is given in the building of the desire body,  very little  in
that  of  the vital body and almost none in the dense body;  yet  even  this
little is sufficient to make each individual an expression of his own spirit
and different from the parents.

    When  the impregnation of the ovum has taken place,  the desire body  of
the  mother works upon it for a period of from eighteen to twenty-one  days,
the Ego remaining outside in its desire body and mind sheath,  yet always in
close touch with the mother.   Upon the expiration of that time the Ego  en-
ters the mother's body.  The bell-shaped  vehicles draw themselves down over




[PAGE 139]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

the  head  of the vital body and the bell closes at the bottom.   From  this
time the Ego broods over its coming instrument until the birth of the  child
and the new earth life of the returning Ego commences.
[PAGE 139 cont'd]                            MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

                          BIRTH OF THE DENSE BODY

    The  vehicles of the new-born do not at once become active.   The  dense
body is helpless for a long time after birth.  Reasoning from analogy we can
readily  see that the same must be the case with the higher  vehicles.   The
occult  scientist sees it,  but even without clairvoyance reason  will  show
that  this  must  be  so.   As the dense body is  slowly  prepared  for  the
separate,  individual life within the protecting cover of the womb,  so  the
other  bodies are gradually born and nurtured into activity,  and while  the
times given in the following description are but approximate,  they are nev-
ertheless  accurate enough for general purposes and show the connection  be-
tween the Microcosm and the Macrocosm--the individual and the world.

    In  the  period  immediately  following  birth  the  different  vehicles
inter-penetrate one another, as, in our previous illustration, the sand pen-
etrates the sponge and the water both sand and sponge.  But, though they are
all  present,  as in adult life,  they are MERELY PRESENT.   None  of  their
positive faculties are active.   The vital body cannot use the forces  which
operate along the positive pole of the ethers.   Assimilation,  which  works
along the positive pole of the chemical ether,  is very dainty during child-
hood  and  what  there is of it is due to the macrocosmic  vital  body,  the
ethers  of which act as a womb for the child's vital body until the  seventh
year, gradually ripening it  during  that  period.  The propagative faculty,




[PAGE 140]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

which works along the positive pole of the life ether, is also latent.   The
heating  of  the  body--which  is  carried on along the positive pole of the 
light ether--and the  circulation  of the blood are due to  the  macrocosmic  
vital body,  the ethers acting on  the child and slowly developing it to the  
point where it can control these functions itself.  The forces working along  
the negative pole of the ethers are so much the more active.   The excretion  
of solides,  carried on  along  the  negative  pole  of  the chemical  ether  
(corresponding  to   the  solid  subdivision  of  the  Chemical  Region), is  
too unrestrained,  as is also the excretion of fluid,  which is  carried  on 
along the  negative pole of the life ether (corresponding to the  second  or  
fluid subdivision of the Chemical  Region).  The  passive  sense-perception,  
which  is   due   to  the  negative  forces  of the  light  ether,  is  also  
exceedingly prominent.  The child is very impressionable and it is "all eyes 
and ears." 

    During the earlier years the forces operating along the negative pole of
the reflecting ether are also extremely active.  In those years children can
"see" the higher Worlds and they often prattle about what they see until the
ridicule of their elders or punishment for "telling stories" teaches them to
desist.

    It is deplorable that the little ones are forced to  lie--or at least to
deny  the truth--because  of the incredulity of their "wise"  elders.   Even
the  investigations  of the Society for Physical Research have  proven  that
children  often  have invisible playmates, who frequently visit  them  until
they  are  several years old.   During those years the clairvoyance  of  the
children is of the same negative character as that of the mediums.

    It is the same with the forces working in the desire body.   The passive
feeling of physical pain is present,  while the feeling of emotion is almost




[PAGE 141]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

entirely absent.   The child will, of course,  show emotion on the slightest
provocation,  but the duration of that emotion is but momentary.   It all on
the surface.

    The  child also has the link of mind,  but is almost incapable of  indi-
vidual  thought  activity.   It is exceedingly sensitive to  forces  working
along the negative pole and is therefore imitative and teachable.

    Thus  it  is  shown that all the negative qualities are  active  in  the
new-born  entity,  but before it is able to use its different vehicles,  the
positive qualities must be ripened.

    Each vehicle is therefore brought to a certain degree of maturity by the
activity of the corresponding vehicle of the macrocosm, which acts as a womb
for it until that degree is reached.

    From  the first to the seventh year the vital body grows and slowly  ma-
tures  within  the  womb of the macrocosmic vital body and  because  of  the
greater  wisdom  of this vehicle of the macrocosm the child's body  is  more
rounded and well-built than in later life.

                          BIRTH OF THE VITAL BODY.

    While  the macrocosmic vital body guides the growth of the child's  body
it is guarded from the dangers which later threaten it when the unwise indi-
vidual vital body takes unchecked charge.  This happens in the seventh year,
when the period of excessive, dangerous growth begins, and continues through
the next seven years.  During this time the macrocosmic desire body performs
the function of a womb for the individual desire body.

    Were the vital body to have continual and unrestrained sway in the human
kingdom, as it has in the plant, man would grow to an enormous size.   There
was a time in the far distant past when  man  was  constituted like a plant,




[PAGE 142]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

having only a dense body and a vital body.   The traditions of mythology and
folk-lore all over the world concerning giants in olden times are absolutely
true, because then men grew as tall trees, and for the same reason.

                         BIRTH OF THE DESIRE BODY.

    The  vital body of the plant builds leaf after leaf,  carrying the  stem
higher  and higher.   Were it not for the macrocosmic desire body  it  would
keep on in that way indefinitely,  but the macrocosmic desire body steps  in
at a certain point and checks further growth.   The force that is not needed
for further growth is then available for other purposes and is used to build
the  flower  and the seed.   In like manner the human vital body,  when  the
dense body comes under its sway,  after the seventh year,  makes the  latter
grow very rapidly,  but about the fourteenth year the individual desire body
is  born  from the womb of the macrocosmic desire body and is then  free  to
work on its dense body.   The excessive growth is then checked and the force
theretofore  used for that purpose becomes available for  propagation,  that
the human plant may flower and bring forth.  Therefore the birth of the per-
sonal desire body marks the period of puberty.  From this period the attrac-
tion  towards  the  opposite  sex  is  felt,  being  especially  active  and
unrestrained in the third septenary period of  life--from the fourteenth  to
the twenty-first year, because the restraining mind is then still unborn.

                             BIRTH OF THE MIND.

    After the fourteenth year, the mind is in turn brooded over and nurtured
by  the macrocosmic mind,  unfolding its latent possibilities and making  it
capable of original  thought.  The  forces  of  the  individual's  different




[PAGE 143]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

vehicles have now been ripened to such a degree that he can use them all  in
his evolution, therefore at the twenty-first year the Ego comes into posses-
sion of its complete vehicle.   It does this by means of the blood-heat  and
by  developing individual blood.   This is done in connection with the  full
development of the light ether.

                     THE BLOOD THE VEHICLE OF THE EGO.

    In infancy,  and up to the fourteenth year,  the red marrow-bones do not
make  all  the blood corpuscles.   Most of them are supplied by  the  thymus
gland,  which is largest in the fetus and gradually diminishes as the  indi-
vidual blood-making faculty develops in the growing child.  The thymus gland
contains, as it were, a supply of blood corpuscles given by the parents, and
consequently the child, which draws its blood from that source, does not re-
alize its individuality.   Not until the blood is made by the child does  it
think of itself as "I," and when the thymus gland disappears,  at the age of
fourteen, the "I" feeling reaches its full expression, for then the blood is
made and dominated entirely by the Ego.   The following will make clear  the
idea and its logic:

    It  will  be  remembered that assimilation and growth  depend  upon  the
forces  working along the positive pole of the vital body's chemical  ether.
That is set free at the seventh year, together with the balance of the vital
body.   Only the chemical ether is fully ripe at that time;  the other parts
need  more  ripening.   At the fourteenth year the life ether of  the  vital
body,  which has to do with propagation, is fully ripe.   In the period from
seven  to fourteen years of age the excessive assimilation has stored up  an
amount  of force which goes to the sex organs and is ready at the  time  the
desire body is set free.




[PAGE 144]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    This  force  of  sex  is stored in the blood during  the  third  of  the
seven-year periods and in that time the light ether, which is the avenue for
the  blood-heat,  is developed and controls the heart,  so that the body  is
neither too hot nor too cold.  In early childhood the blood very often rises
to  an abnormal temperature.   During the period of excessive growth  it  is
frequently the reverse, but in the hot-headed,  unrestrained youth,  passion
and temper very often drive the Ego out by over-heating the blood.   We very
appropriately call this an ebullition or boiling over of temper and describe
the effect as causing the person to "lose his head," i.e.,  become incapable
of  thought.   That is exactly what happens when passion,  rage,  or  temper
overheats the blood, thus drawing the Ego outside the bodies.   The descrip-
tion is accurate when,  of a person in such a state,  we say,  "He has  lost
control of himself."   The Ego is outside of his vehicles and they are  run-
ning amuck,  bereft of the guiding influence of thought, part of the work of
which  is to act as a brake on impulse.   The great and terrible  danger  of
such outbursts is that before the owner re-enters his body some  disembodied
entity may take possession of it and keep him out.   This is called  "obses-
sion."   Only  the man who keeps cool and does not allow excess of  heat  to
drive  him out can think properly.   As proof of the assertion that the  Ego
cannot  work  in the body when the blood is either tool hot or too  cold  we
will  call  attention to the well-known fact that excessive heat  makes  one
sleepy and, if carried beyond a certain point, it drives the Ego out,  leav-
ing the body in a faint,  that is,  unconscious.   Excessive cold has also a
tendency to make the body sleepy or unconscious.   It is only when the blood
is at or near the normal temperature that the Ego can use it as a vehicle of
consciousness.




[PAGE 145]                                   MAN AND THE METHOD OF EVOLUTION

    To further show the connection of the ego with the blood we may  mention
the burning blush of shame,  which is an evidence of the manner in which the
blood  is  driven to the head, thus over-heating the  brain  and  paralyzing
thought.   Fear is the state when the Ego wants to barricade himself against
some outside danger.  He then drives the blood to the center and grows pale,
because the blood has left the periphery of the body and has lost heat, thus
paralyzing thought.   His blood "freezes," he shivers and his teeth chatter,
as when the temperature is lowered by atmospheric conditions.   In fever the
excess of heat causes delirium.

    The  full-blooded person,  when the blood is not too hot,  is active  in
body and mind, while the anemic person is sleepy.  In one the Ego has better
control; in the other less.  When the Ego wants to think it drives blood, at
the proper heat,  to the brain.   When a heavy meal centers the activity  of
the Ego upon the digestive tracts, the man cannot think; he is sleepy.

    The old Norsemen and the Scots recognized that the Ego is in the  blood.
No  stranger  could become associated with them as a relative until  he  had
"mixed blood"  with them and thus become one of them.   Goethe,  who was  an
Initiate,  also showed this in his "Faust."  Faust is about to sign the com-
pact with Mephistopheles and asks, "Why not sign with ordinary ink?  Why use
blood?"   Mephisto answers,  "Blood is a most peculiar essence."   He knows,
that who has the blood has the man; that without the warm blood,  no Ego can
find expression.

    The proper heat for the real expression of the Ego is not present  until
the mind is born from the macrocosmic  Concrete Mind,  when  the  individual





[PAGE 146]                                  THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

is  about twenty-one years old.   Statutory law also recognizes this as  the
earliest age when the man is deemed fit to exercise a franchise.

    At  the  present stage of human development the man goes  through  these
principal stages in each life cycle, from one birth to the next.

                    REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE.

    Only  three theories worthy of note have ever been brought  forward  to
solve the riddle of Life and Death.

    In the previous chapter we have, to some extent, explained one of these
three theories--that  of Rebirth,  together with it companion law,  the law
of  Consequence.   It may not be out of place to compare the theory of  Re-
birth  with the other two theories advanced,  with a view  to  ascertaining
their relative and foundation in nature.   To the occultist there can be no
question.   He does not say what he "believes"  in it any more than we need
to say that we "believe"  as to the blooming of the rose or the flowing  of
the river,  or the operation of any of the visible workings of the material
world,  which are continually going on before our eyes.   We do not say  of
these things that we "believe;" we say that we "know," because we see them.
So the occult scientist can say "I know"  in regard to Rebirth,  the law of
Consequence and their corollaries.   He sees the Ego and can trace its path
after it has passed out of the dense body at death until it has  reappeared
on earth through a new birth.   Therefore to him no "belief"  is necessary.
For the satisfaction of others,  however,  it may be well to examine  these
three theories of life and death in order to arrive at an intelligent  con-
clusion.



[PAGE 148]                                THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

     Any  great law of nature must necessarily be in harmony with  all  her
other  laws.   Therefore it may be very helpful to the inquirer to  examine
these theories in their relation to what are admitted by all parties to  be
"known laws of nature," as observed in that part of our universe with which
we are more familiar.  To this end we will first state the three theories:

(1) The Materialistic Theory holds that life is a journey from the womb  to
    the  tomb;  that mind is the result of certain correlations of  matter;
    than  man  is  the highest intelligence in the Cosmos;  and,  that  his
    intelligence perishes when the body disintegrates at death.

(2) The Theory of Theology asserts that at each birth a newly-created  soul
    enters  the arena of life fresh from the hand of God,  passing from  an
    invisible state through the gate of birth into visible existence;  that
    at  the end of one short span of life in the material world  it  passes
    out through the gate of death into the invisible beyond,  whence it re-
    turns  no more;  that  its happiness or misery there is determined  for
    all eternity by its actions during the infinitesimal period intervening
    between birth and death.

(3) The  Theory  of Rebirth teaches that each soul is an integral  part  of
    God,  enfolding all divine possibilities as the seed enfolds the plant;
    that  by means of repeated existences in an earthly body  of  gradually
    improving quality,  the latent possibilities are slowly developed  into
    dynamic powers;  that none are lost by this process,  but that all man-
    kind  will ultimately attain the goal of perfection and  re-union  with
    God.




[PAGE 149]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

The first of these theories is monistic.  It seeks to  explain all facts of
existence as processes within the material world.   The two other  theories
agree  in  being dualistic,  that is,  they ascribe some of the  facts  and
phases of existence to a super-physical,  invisible state,  but they differ
widely on other points.

    Bringing  the materialistic theory into comparison with the known  laws
of  the universe,  we find that the continuity of force is as  well  estab-
lished as the continuity of matter and both are beyond the need of elucida-
tion.   We also know that matter and force are inseparable in the  Physical
World.  This is contrary to the materialistic theory, which holds that mind
perishes at death.   When nothing can be destroyed,  mind must be included.
Moreover we know that mind is superior to matter, for it molds the fact, so
that  it becomes a reflection or mirror of the mind.   We  have  discovered
that  the particles of our bodies are constantly changing;  that  at  least
once  in  seven years there is a change in every atom of  matter  composing
them.   If the materialistic theory were true, the consciousness ought also
to undergo an entire change, with no memory of that which preceded, so that
at  no  time could man remember any event more than seven years.   We  know
that is not the case.   We remember the events of our childhood.   Many  of
the most trivial incidents though forgotten in ordinary consciousness, have
been  distinctly recalled in a swift vision of the whole life  by  drowning
persons,  who have related the experience after resuscitation.  Similar ex-
periences  in states of trance are also common.   Materialism is unable  to
account for these phases of sub- and super-consciousness.  It ignores them.
At the present stage of scientific investigation,  where leading scientists
have  established  beyond  a doubt the existence of  these  phenomena,  the
policy  of ignoring them is a serious defect in a theory claiming to  solve
the greatest problem of life--Life itself.



[PAGE 150]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    We may therefore safely pass from the materialistic theory as being in-
adequate to solve the mystery of life and death and turn to a consideration
of the next theory.

    One of the greatest objections to the orthodox theological doctrine, as
it is expounded, is its entire and confessed inadequacy.  Of the myriads of
souls  which have been created and have inhabited this Globe since the  be-
ginning of existence, even if that beginning dates back no further than six
thousand years, the insignificant number of only "one hundred and forty and
four thousand"  are to be saved!   The rest are to be tortured forever  and
ever!   The devil gets the best of it all the time.  One cannot help saying
with Buddha, "If God permits such misery to exist He cannot be good, and if
He is powerless to prevent it, He cannot be God."

    Nothing  in nature is analogous to such a method of creation  in  order
that destruction may follow.  It is represented that God desires ALL should
be saved and is averse to the destruction of any,  having for their  salva-
tion "given His only Son," and yet this "glorious plan of salvation"  fails
to save!

    If a trans-Atlantic liner with two thousand souls on board sent a wire-
less message that she was sinking just off Sandy Hook, would it be regarded
as a "glorious plan of salvation"  if a fast motor-boat capable of rescuing
only two or three people, were sent to her aid?   Certainly not!   It would
more likely be denounced as a "plan of destruction"  if adequate means were
not provided for the saving of at least majority of those in danger.

    But the theologians'  plan of salvation is vastly worse than this,  be-
cause two or three of  two thousand is an immensely greater proportion than




[PAGE 151]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

the orthodox theological plan of saving only 144,000 out of all the myriads
of souls created.  We may safely reject this theory also,  as being untrue,
because unreasonable.  If God were allwise He would have evolved a more ef-
ficacious plan.  So He has, and the above is only the theory of the theolo-
gian. The teaching of the Bible is very different, as will appear later.

    We  turn now to consider the doctrine of Rebirth,  which  postulates  a
slow process of development, carried on with unwavering persistence through
repeated embodiments in forms of increasing efficiency whereby all are,  in
time, brought to a height of spiritual splendor at present inconceivable to
us.   There  is  nothing unreasonable nor difficult to  accept  in  such  a
theory.  As we look about us we find everywhere in nature this striving for
perfection in a slow,  persistent manner. We find no sudden process of cre-
ation  or destruction,  such as the theologian postulates,  but we do  find
"Evolution."

    Evolution  is "the history of the progression of the Spirit  in  Time."
Everywhere, as we see about us the varied phenomena in the universe, we re-
alize that the path of evolution is a spiral.  Each loop of the spiral is a
cycle.   Each  cycle merges into the next, as the loops of the  spiral  are
continuous, each cycle being the improved product of those preceding it and
the creator of those more developed states which succeed it.

    A straight line is but the extension of a point.   It occupies but  one
dimension in space.   The theory of the materialist and that of the theolo-
gian  would be analogous to this line.   The materialist makes the line  of
life start at birth,  and to be consistent,  the death hour must  terminate
it.  The theologian  commences his line with the creation of  the soul just




[PAGE 152]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

previous to birth.   After death the soul lives on,  it fate  irretrievably
determined by the deeds of a few short years.   There is no coming back  to
correct mistakes.  The line runs straight on, implying a modicum of experi-
ence and no elevation for the soul after death.

    Natural  progression does not follow a straight line such as these  two
theories  imply;  nor  even  a  circular  path,  for  that  would  imply  a
never-ending  round of the same experiences and the use of only two  dimen-
sions in space.  All things move in progressive cycles and in order to take
full  advantages  of all the opportunities for advancement offered  by  our
three-dimensional universe,  it is necessary that the evolving life  should
take the three-dimensional path--the spiral--which goes ever onward and up-
ward.

    Whether we look at the modest little plant in our garden,  or go to the
redwood  district of California and examine one of the giant Sequoias  with
its thirty-foot diameter, it is always the same--every branch, twig or leaf
will be found growing in either a single or a double spiral, or in opposite
pairs,  each balancing either,  analogous to ebb and flow,  day and  night,
life and death and other ALTERNATING activities in nature.

    Examine  the vaulted arch of the sky and observe the fiery  nebulae  or
the path of the Solar-Systems--everywhere the spiral meets the eye.  In the
spring the Earth discards its white blanket and emerges from its period  of
rest its winter sleep.   All activities are exerted to bring forth new life
everywhere.   Time  passes.   The corn and the grape are ripened  and  har-
vested.  Again the busy summer fades into the silence and inactivity of the
winter.  Again the snowy coverlet enwraps the Earth.  But her sleep  is not




[PAGE 153]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

forever; she will wake again to the song of the new spring, which will mark
for her a little further progress along the pathway of time.

    So with the Sun.  He rises in the morning of each day, but each morning
he is further along on his journey through the year.

    Everywhere the spiral--ONWARD, UPWARD, FOREVER!

    Is it possible that this law, so universal in all other realms,  should
be inoperative in the life of man?  Shall the earth wake each year from its
winter  sleep;  shall the tree and the flower live again and man  die?   It
cannot  be!   The same law that wakes the life in the plant to  new  growth
will wake the human being to new experience, to further progress toward the
goal  of perfection.   Therefore the theory of Rebirth,  which teaches  re-
peated  embodiment in gradually improving vehicles,  is in  perfect  accord
with  evolution and the phenomena of nature,  which the other two  theories
are not.

    Regarding life from an ethical viewpoint,  we find that the law of  Re-
birth  coupled with the companion law of Consequence,  is the  only  theory
that will satisfy a sense of justice,  in harmony with the facts of life as
we see them about us.

    It is not easy for the logical mind to understand how a "just and  lov-
ing"  God can require the same virtues from the milliards whom He has  been
"pleased to place in differing circumstances" according to no apparent rule
nor  system,  but willy-nilly,  according to His own capricious mood.   One
lives in luxury;  the other on "kicks and crusts."   One has a moral educa-
tion and an atmosphere of high ideals; the other is placed in squalid  sur-
roundings  and taught to lie and steal and that the more he does  of  both,
the more of a success he is.   It is just to require the same of both?   Is
it right to reward one for living a good life when  he  was  placed  in  an





[PAGE 154]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

environment  that made it extremely difficult for him to go astray,  or  to
punish the other,  who was handicapped to such an extent that he never  had
an  idea of what constitutes true morality.   Surely not!   Is it not  more
logical  to think that we may have misinterpreted the Bible than to  impute
to God such a monstrous plan and method of procedure?

    It  is  useless to say that we must not inquire into the  mysteries  of
God;  that they are past our finding out.   The inequalities of life can be
satisfactorily  explained by the twin laws of Rebirth and  Consequence  and
made to harmonize with the conception of a just and loving God,  as  taught
by Christ Himself.

    Moreover,  by  means  of these twin laws a  way  to  emancipation  from
present  undesirable  position or environment is show,  together  with  the
means of attaining to any degree of development, no matter how imperfect we
may be now.

    What we are, what we have, all our good qualities are the result of our
own actions in the past.  What we lack in physical, moral, or mental excel-
lence may yet be ours in the future.

    Exactly  as we cannot do otherwise than take up our lives each  morning
where  we laid them down the preceding night,  so by our work  in  previous
lives  have we made the conditions under which we now live and  labor,  and
are at present creating the conditions of our future lives.  Instead of be-
moaning  the lack of this or that faculty which we covet,  we must  set  to
work to acquire it.

    If one child plays beautifully on a musical instrument,  with hardly an
effort at learning,  while another,  despite persistent effort,  is a  poor
player in comparison, it merely shows that one  expended  the  effort  in a




[PAGE 155]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

previous life and is easily regaining a former proficiency,  while the  ef-
forts of the other have been started only in the present life,  and in con-
sequence we see the uphill work.  But, if the latter persist, he may,  even
in the present life,  become superior to the former unless the former  con-
stantly improves.

    That we do not remember the effort made in acquiring a faculty by  hard
work  is immaterial,  it does not alter the fact that the  faculty  remains
with us.

    Genius  is the hall-mark of the advanced soul,  which by hard  work  in
many  previous  lives has developed itself in some way  beyond  the  normal
achievements of the race.  It reveals a glimpse of the degree of attainment
which will be the common possession of the coming Race.   It cannot be  ac-
counted for by heredity,  which applies only in part to the dense body  and
not to qualities of the soul.   If genius could be accounted for by  hered-
ity, why is there not a long line of mechanical ancestry previous to Thomas
Edison,  each  more  capable than his predecessor?   Why  does  not  genius
propagate  itself?   Why is not  Siegfried the son,  greater  than  Richard
Wagner, the father?

    In cases where the expression of genius depends upon the possession  of
specially  constructed  organs,  requiring ages  of  development,  the  Ego
naturally  is reborn in a family the Egos of which have,  for  generations,
labored to build a similar organism.  That is why twenty-nine musicians  of
more  or  less genius were born in the Bach family during a period  of  two
hundred and fifty years.   That genius is an expression of the soul and not
of  the  body is shown by the fact that it did not  gradually  improve  and
reach efflorescence in the person of John Sebastian Bach, but that the pro-
ficiency which reached its highest expression in him towered high above an-
cestors and descendants alike.




[PAGE 156]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    The  body is simply an instrument, the work it yields  being  dependent
upon  the Ego which guides it,  as the quality of the melody  is  dependent
upon the musician's skill,  aided by the TIMBRE of the instrument.   A good
musician cannot fully express himself on a poor instrument,  and even  upon
the same instrument,  all musicians do not and cannot play alike.   Because
an Ego seeks rebirth as the son of a great musician it does not necessarily
follow that he must be a still greater genius,  as would be the case if the
physical heredity were a fact and genius were not a soul-quality.

    The  "Law of Attraction"  accounts in quite as satisfactory manner  for
the facts we ascribe to heredity.   We know that people of like tastes will
seek another.  If we know that a friend is in a certain city, but are igno-
rant  of  his address,  we will naturally be governed by the law  of  asso-
ciation  in our efforts to find him.   If he is a musician,  he  will  most
likely  be found where musicians are wont to assemble;  if he is a  student
inquiry will be made at public libraries, reading-rooms and book stores, or
if he is a sporting man we would seek him at race tracks, pool-rooms or sa-
loons.   It is not probable that the musician or the student would frequent
the  latter places and it is safe to say that our search for  the  sporting
man would not be successful if we sought him in a library or at a classical
concert.

    Similarly,  the Ego ordinarily gravitates to the most  congenial  asso-
ciations.   It is constrained to do so by one of the twin forces of the De-
sire World--the force of Attraction.

    The  objection may be urged that there are people of entirely  opposite
tastes,  or bitter enemies even,  in the same family, and if the law of As-
sociation governed why should they be attracted thereto?



[PAGE 157]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

    The explanation of such cases is that during the Ego's earth lives many
relations have been established with various people.   These relations were
pleasant or otherwise, involving on one hand obligation which were not liq-
uidated at the time;  or on the other involving the infliction of an injury
and  a feeling of very strong hate between the injured and his enemy.   The
law of Consequence requires an exact adjustment of the score.   Death  does
not "pay it all" any more than moving to another city will liquidate a mon-
etary debt.  The time comes when the two enemies will meet again.   The old
hate has brought them together in the same family,  because it is the  pur-
pose of God that all shall love one another;  therefore hate must be trans-
formed into love and though, perchance, they may spend many lives "fighting
it out," they will at some time learn the lesson and become friends and mu-
tual  benefactors  instead of enemies.   In such cases the  Interest  these
people had in one another set in action the force of Attraction,  and  that
brought  them  together.   Had they simply been mutually  Indifferent  they
could not have become associated.

    Thus do the twin laws of Rebirth and Consequence solve,  in a  rational
manner,  all the problems incident to human life as man  steadily  advances
toward the next stage in evolution--the Superman.  The  trend of humanity's
progress  is  onward and upward forever,  says  this  theory--not  as  some
people  think who have confounded the doctrine of Rebirth with the  foolish
teaching of some Indian tribes who believe that man is reborn in animals or
plants.   That would be retrogression.   No authority for this doctrine  of
retrogression  can  be  found  in  nature  or  in  the  sacred books of any




[PAGE 158]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

religion.   In one (and one only) of the religious writings of India is  it
touched upon.   In the Kathopanishad (ch.  v,  verse 9)  it is stated  that
"Some men,  according to their deeds,  go into the womb and others into the
'sthanu.'"  "Sthanu"  is a Sanskrit word, which means "motionless,"  but it
also means ~a pillar," and has been interpreted to mean that some men,  be-
cause of their sins, go back to the motionless plant kingdom.

    Spirits  incarnate only to gain experience;  to conquer the  world;  to
overcome the lower self and attain self-mastery.   When we realize this  we
shall understand that there comes a time when there is no further need  for
incarnation because the lessons have all been learned.  The teaching of the
Kathopanishad  indicates  that instead of remaining tied to  the  wheel  of
birth  and  death,  man will at some time go into the motionless  state  of
"Nirvana."

    In the Book of Revelation we find these worlds:   "Him that  overcometh
will I make a PILLAR in the temple of my God AND HE SHALL GO NO MORE  OUT,"
referring to entire liberation from concrete existence.   Nowhere is  there
any authority for the doctrine of the transmigration of souls.   A man  who
has evolved so far as to have an individual, separate soul cannot turn back
in his progress and enter the vehicle of animal or plant, which are under a
group-spirit.   The  individual  spirit  is a  higher  evolution  that  the
group-spirit and the lesser cannot obtain the greater.

    Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his beautiful poem, "The Chambered Nautilus,"
has  embodied this idea of constant progression in gradually improving  ve-
hicles,  and  final liberation.   The nautilus builds its spiral  shell  in
chambered sections,  constantly leaving the smaller ones, which it has out-
grown, for the one last built:

****************************************
Year after year beheld the silent toil
That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year's dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more.

Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap forlorn!
From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn!
While on mine ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:

Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul!
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave they low-vaulted past!
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
'Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!

    The necessity,  previously referred to,  of obtaining an organism of  a
specific  nature,  brings to mind an interesting phase of the twin laws  of
Rebirth and Consequence.   These laws are connected with the motion of  the
Cosmic bodies, the Sun, the planets and the signs of the  Zodiac.  All move
in  harmony  with these laws,  guided in their orbits by  their  indwelling
spiritual Intelligences--the Planetary Spirits.

    On  account of the precession of the equinoxes the Sun  moves  backward
through the twelve signs of the Zodiac at the rate of approximately one de-
gree of space in 72 years,  and through each sign (30 degrees of space)  in
about 2,100 years, or around the whole circle in about 26,000 years.

    This is due to the fact that the Earth does not spin upon a  stationary
axis.   Its  axis has a slow,  swinging motion of its own  (just  like  the
wabble of a spinning top  that  has  almost  spent  its force), so  that it



[PAGE 160]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

describes  a circle in space and thus one star after another  becomes  Pole
Star.

    Because  of this wabbling motion the Sun does not cross the equator  in
the same place every year,  but a few hundred rods further back,  hence the
name,  the "precession of the equinoxes," because the equinox  "precedes"--
comes to early.

    All happenings on the Earth in connection with the other Cosmic  bodies
and  their inhabitants are connected with this and other Cosmic  movements.
So are also the laws of Rebirth and Consequence.

    As  the Sun passes through the different signs of in the course of  the
year,  the climatic and other changes affect man and his activities in dif-
ferent  ways.   Similarly the passage of the Sun by the procession  of  the
equinoxes,  through  the  twelve signs of the  Zodiac--which  is  called  a
World-year,  brings about conditions on the Earth of a far greater variety.
It  is necessary to the growth of the soul that it should  experience  them
all.   In fact,  as we have seen,  the man himself makes  these  conditions
while  in the Heaven World between births.   Therefore,  every Ego is  born
twice  during the time the Sun is passing through one sign of the   Zodiac;
and, as the soul itself is necessarily double-sexed, in order to obtain all
experiences, it is reborn alternately in a male and a female body.  This is
because  the experience of one sex differs widely from that of  the  other.
At  the same time,  the outside conditions are not greatly altered  in  one
thousand years and therefore permit the entity to receive experience in the
same identical environment from the standpoint of both man and woman.

    These are the general terms upon with the law of Rebirth operates,  but
as  it is not a blind law, it is subject to frequent modifications,  deter-
mined by the Lords of Destiny, the Recording Angels, as, for instance, in a




[PAGE 161]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

case where an Ego needs a sensitive eye or ear and there is an  opportunity
for giving it the required instrument in a family with which relations have
previously been established.   The time for the re-embodiment of the Ego is
question may lack,  perhaps,  two hundred years of being ripe according  to
the average period, but it is seen by the Lords of Destiny that unless this
opportunity  is embraced,  the Ego will perhaps have to spend four or  five
hundred  years  in heaven in excess of the time  required,  before  another
chance will present itself.   Therefore the Ego is brought to rebirth ahead
of schedule time,  so to speak,  the deficiency of rest in the third heaven
being made up at another time.   So we see that,  not only do the  departed
work on us from the Heaven World,  but we also work on them,  attracting or
repelling them.   A favorable opportunity for procuring a suitable  instru-
ment may attract an Ego to rebirth.   Had no instrument been available,  he
would  have been kept longer in heaven and the surplus time  deducted  from
his succeeding heaven lives.

    The law of Consequence also works in harmony with the stars,  so that A
MAN IS BORN AT THE TIME  WHEN THE POSITIONS OF THE BODIES IN THE SOLAR SYS-
TEM WILL GIVE THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO HIS EXPERIENCE AND ADVANCEMENT IN
THE SCHOOL OF LIFE. That is why Astrology is an  absolutely  true  science,
though  even  the best astrologer may misinterpret it,  because,  like  all
other human beings,  he is fallible.  The stars show accurately the time in
a  man's  life when the debt which the Lords of Destiny have  selected  for
payment is due, and to evade it is beyond the power of man.  Yes, they show
the very day, although we are not always able to read them correctly.

    Perhaps  the  most  striking  instance  known  to  the  writer  of this




[PAGE 162]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

inability to escape what is written in the stars,  though perfectly  cogni-
zant of it,  occurred in Los Angeles, California,  in 1906.   Some instruc-
tions in astrology were given to Mr. L., a well-known lecturer.   Mr.  L.'s
own horoscope was taken up, because a pupil will be more interested in that
than  in the nativity of a stranger.   He is also enabled to check the  ac-
curacy  of  the interpretation of the signs which are given  to  him.   The
horoscope revealed a liability to accidents and Mr.  L.  was shown how  ac-
cidents and other events in the past figured to the time of occurrence.  In
addition,  he was told that another accident would befall him and  that  it
would occur on the twenty-first of the following July,  or the seventh  day
after,  i.e.,  one the twenty-eighth,  the latter day being regarded as the
more  dangerous.   He was warned against conveyances of any  kind  and  the
place  of  the threatened injury was designated as the  breast,  shoulders,
arms and lower part of the head.  He was thoroughly convinced of the danger
and promised to remain at home on that day.

    The  writer  went north to Seattle and a few days before  the  critical
time wrote to Mr. L. and again warned him.  Mr. L.  answered that he remem-
bered the warning and would act accordingly.

    The  next  communication  in regard to the matter came  from  a  mutual
friend, who stated that on the 29th of July Mr. L. had gone to Sierra Madre
on an electric car which had collided with a railroad train,  Mr.  L.  sus-
taining injuries of the exact description mentioned and also having a  ten-
don cut in the left leg.

    The question was why Mr. L., having entire faith in the prediction, had
disregarded the advice.   The explanation came three months later,  when he
had recovered sufficiently to write.  The letter said,  "I thought the 28th
was the 29th."

[PAGE 163]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

    There  is  no question in the writer's mind that this was  a  piece  of
"ripe"  fate,  impossible to escape,  which was accurately foreshown by the
stars.

    The stars may therefore be called the "Clock of Destiny."   The  twelve
signs of the Zodiac correspond to the dial;  the Sun and the planets to the
hour hand, indicating the month of the year when the different items in the
score of ripe fate allotted to each life are due to work themselves out.

    It  cannot be sufficiently emphasized, however,  that though there  are
some things that cannot be escaped, man has a certain scope of free will in
modifying causes already set going.  A poet puts it thus:

    One ship sails east and another sails west
          With the self-same winds that blow.
    'Tis the set of the sail and not the gale
          Which determines the way they go.

    As the winds of the sea are the ways of fate
          As we voyage along through life,
    'Tis the act of the soul that determines the goal,
          And not the calm or the strife.

    The  great point to grasp is that our present actions determine  future
conditions.

    Orthodox  religionists and even those who profess no religion  at  all,
often bring forward as one of their strongest objections to the law of  Re-
birth that it is taught in India to the "ignorant heathen,"  who believe in
it.   If it is a natural law, however,  there is no objection strong enough
to invalidate it or make it inoperative.  Before we speak of "ignorant hea-
then,"  or  send  missionaries to them, it might be well to examine our own



[PAGE 164]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

knowledge a little.  Educators everywhere complain of superficiality on the
part of our students.  Professor Wilbur L. Cross,  of Yale,  mentions among
other startling cases of ignorance,  the fact that in a class of forty stu-
dents, NOT ONE COULD "PLACE" JUDAS ISCARIOT!

    It would seem as though the labors of missionaries could profitably  be
diverted  from  "heathen"  countries and from slum work  to  enlighten  the
college-bred individuals of our own country, on the principle that "charity
begins at home,"  and "as God will not let the ignorant heathen perish"  it
would  seem  better to leave him in ignorance where he is sure  of  heaven,
than  to enlighten him and so render his chances of going to  hell  legion.
Surely, this is a case of "Where ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise."
We would be doing ourselves and the heathen a signal service by letting him
alone and looking after the ignorant Christian nearer home.

    Moreover,  to call this heathen doctrine does not disprove it.  Its as-
sumed priority in the East is not more an argument against it that the  ac-
curacy of the solution of a mathematical problem is invalidated because  we
do  not happen to like the person who first solved it.   The only  question
is:  Is it correct?  If so, it is absolutely immaterial whence the solution
first came.

    All other religions have been but leading up to the Christian religion.
They  were Race Religions and contain only in part that which  Christianity
has  in fuller  measure.   The real Esoteric Christianity has not yet  been
taught publicly, not will it be so taught until humanity has passed the ma-
terialistic  stage and becomes fitted to receive it.   The laws of  Rebirth
and Consequence have been secretly taught all the time, but, BY THE  DIRECT



[PAGE 165]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

COMMAND OF CHRIST HIMSELF,  as we shall see,  these two laws have not  been
PUBLICLY taught in the Western world for the past two thousand years.

                       WINE AS A FACTOR IN EVOLUTION

    To  understand the reason for this omission and the means  employed  to
obscure these teachings,  we must go back to the beginning of man's history
and see how,  for his good,  he has been led by the Great Teacher of human-
ity.

    In  the  teaching of occult science the stages of  development  on  the
earth  are divided into periods called "Epochs."   There have been four  of
these Epochs, which are designated as follows, respectively:  The Polarian,
the Hyperborean,  the Lemurian, the Atlantean.  The present Epoch is called
the Aryan Epoch.

    In the First or Polarian Epoch,  what is now humanity had only a  dense
body, as the minerals have now, hence he was mineral-like.

    In  the  Second  or  Hyperborean Epoch, a  vital  body  was  added  and
man-in-the-making possesses a body constituted as are those of plants.   He
was not a plant, but was plantlike.

    In the Third or Lemurian Epoch,  he obtained his desire body and became
constituted like the animal--an animal-man.

    In the Fourth or Atlantean Epoch, mind was unfolded and now,  so far as
his principles are concerned,  he steps upon the stage of physical life  as
MAN.

    In the present,  the Fifth or Aryan Epoch,  man will in some degree un-
fold the third or lowest aspect of his threefold spirit--the Ego.




[PAGE 166]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    The student is requested to strongly impress upon his mind the emphatic
statement  that in the process of evolution up to the time when man  gained
self-consciousness, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WAS LEFT TO CHANCE.

    After  self-consciusness there is a certain scope for the  exercise  of
man's own individual will to enable him to unfold his Divine spiritual pow-
ers.

    The  great Leaders of mankind take everything into  consideration,  the
food  of man included.   This has a great deal to do with his  development.
"Tell  me  what  you  eat  and I will tell you  what  you  are"  is  not  a
far-fetched idea, but a great truth in nature.

    The man of the first Epoch was ethereal.   That does not contradict the
statement that he was mineral-like,  for all gases are mineral.   The Earth
was still soft, not yet having solidified.  In the Bible man is called Adam
and it is said that he was made of earth.

    Cain  is described as an agriculturist.  He symbolizes the man  of  the
Second Epoch.  He had a vital body like the plants which sustained him.

    In the Third Epoch food was obtained from living animals to  supplement
the  former plant food.   Milk was the means used for evolving  the  desire
body,  which made the mankind of that time animal-like.   This is  what  is
meant  by the Bible statement that "Abel was a shepherd."   It  is  nowhere
stated that he killed animals.

    In  the  Fourth  Epoch  man had evolved  beyond  animals--he had  mind.
Thought breaks down nerve cells:  kills, destroys and causes decay.  There-
fore the food of the Atlantean was,  by analogy,  carcasses.   He killed to
eat  and  that is why the Bible states that "Nimrod was a  mighty  hunter."
Nimrod represents the man of the Fourth Epoch.



[PAGE 167]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

    In the meanwhile, man had descended deeper and deeper into matter.  His
former  ethereal body formed the skeleton within and had become solid.   He
had  also lost be degrees the spiritual perception which was  possessed  by
him in the earlier Epochs.  Thus it was designed.  He is destined to get it
back at a higher stage,  plus the self-consciousness which he did not  then
possess.   He had, however, during the first four Epochs,  a greater knowl-
edge of the spiritual world.  He knew he did not die and that when one body
wasted  away  it  was  like  the drying of a leaf  from  the  tree  in  the
autumn--another body would grow to take its place. Therefore he had no real
appreciation of the opportunities and advantages of this Earth life of con-
crete existence.

    But  it  was necessary that he should become thoroughly  awake  to  the
great importance of this concrete existence, so that he might learn from it
all that could be learned.  So long as he felt that he was a citizen of the
higher  Worlds and knew for a certainty that physical life is but  a  small
part  of real existence he did not take it  seriously enough.   He did  not
apply himself to the cultivation of the opportunities for growth which  are
found  only in the present phase of existence.   He dallied his  time  away
without  developing the resources of the world,  as do the people of  India
today, for the same reason.

    The  only way in which an appreciation of concrete  physical  existence
could  be aroused in man was by depriving him of the memory of his  higher,
spiritual existence for a few lives.  Thus, during his Earth life,  he came
to  hold no positive knowledge of any other than the one  present  physical
life, and was in this way impelled to earnestly apply himself to living it.

    There had been religions previous to Christianity which had taught  Re-
birth and the law of Consequence,  but the time had now come when it was no




[PAGE 168]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

longer  conducive to man's advancement that he should know  this  doctrine,
and  ignorance  concerning it came to be regarded as a  sign  of  progress.
This one single life was to be made paramount.   Therefore we find that the
Christian Religion,  as publicly taught, does not embody the laws of Conse-
quence and Rebirth.   Nevertheless,  as Christianity is the religion of the
most advanced Race,  it must be the most advanced Religion,  and because of
the elimination of this doctrine from its PUBLIC teachings, the conquest of
the world of matter is being made by the Anglo-Saxon and Teutonic races, in
which this phase has been carried furthest.

    As  some new addition to or change in the food of man has been made  in
every Epoch to meet its conditions and accomplish its purposes, we now find
added  to  the food of the previous Epochs a  new  article--WINE.   It  was
needed  on account of its benumbing effect upon the spiritual principle  in
man,  because no religion, in and of itself, could have made man forget his
nature  as a spirit and have caused him to think of himself as "a  worm  of
the dust," or made him believe that "we walk with the same force with which
we think"--indeed,  it was never intended that he should go so far as that.

    Hitherto  only water had been used as a drink and in the ceremonies  of
the  Temple service,  but after the submergence  of  Atlantis--a  continent
which once existed between Europe and America, where the Atlantic Ocean now
lies--those  who  escaped destruction began to cultivate the vine and  make
wine,  as we find narrated in the Bible story of Noah.  Noah symbolizes the
remnant of the Atlantean Epoch,  which became the nucleus of the Fifth Race
--therefore our progenitors.




[PAGE 169]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

    The  active principle of alcohol is a "spirit"  and as the humanity  of
the earlier Epochs used the articles of food best suited to their vehicles,
so this spirit was,  in the Fifth Epoch, added to the foods previously used
by evolving humanity.  It acts upon the spirit of the Fifth Epoch man, tem-
porarily paralyzing it,  that it may know,  esteem and conquer the physical
world and value it at its proper worth.  Thus man forgets, for the time be-
ing,  his spiritual home, clinging to this form of existence,  which he has
previously despised,  with all the tenacity born of a feeling that this  is
all there is--or  at least,  preferring the certainty of this world to tak-
ing chances on a heaven which,  in his present muddled state,  he does  not
understand.

    Water  only  had been used in the Temples,  but now  this  is  altered.
"Bacchus,"  a god of wine, appears and under his sway the most advanced na-
tions  forget that there is a higher life.   None who offer tribute to  the
COUNTERFEIT spirit of wine or any alcoholic liquor (the product of  fermen-
tation  and  decay) can ever know anything of  the  higher  Self--the  TRUE
Spirit which is the very source of life.

    All  this  was preparatory to the coming of Christ,  and it is  of  the
highest  significance that HIS FIRST ACT was to change "water  into  wine."
(John ii:11.)

    In private He taught Rebirth to his His disciples.   He not only taught
them in words, but He took them "into the mountain."  This is a mystic term
meaning  a place of Initiation.   In the course of Initiation they see  for
themselves  that Rebirth is a fact, for there Elijah appeared before  them,
who,  they  are told,  is also John the Baptist.   Christ,  in  unequivocal
terms,  had previously told them, when speaking of John the Baptist,  "this
is Elijah who was for to come."  He reiterates  this at the transfiguration




[PAGE 170]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

scene,  saying,  "Elijah has come already and they knew him not,  but  have
done to him whatsoever they listed."   And following this,  it is said that
"they understood He spake of John the Baptist."   (Matt.  xvii:12-13).   On
this occasion,  and also at the time when Rebirth was discussed between Him
and His disciples, they told Him that some thought He was Elijah and others
that He was one of the prophets who had been reborn.   He commanded them to
"tell no man."  (Matt. xvii:9; Like ix:21).  This was to be,  for thousands
of years, an esoteric teaching, to be known only among the few pioneers who
fitted themselves for the knowledge, pushing ahead to the stage of develop-
ment when these truths will again be known to man.

    That  Christ taught Rebirth and also the law of Consequence is  perhaps
shows in not other place as clearly as in the case of the man who had  been
born blind,  where His disciples asked, "Who did sin,  this man or his par-
ents, that he was born blind?"  (John ix:2).

    Had Christ not taught Rebirth and the law of Consequence,  the  natural
answer would have been,  "Nonsense!   How could a man have sinned BEFORE HE
WAS BORN, and have brought blindness upon himself as a result?   But Christ
does not answer in that way.  He is not surprised at the question, nor does
He treat it as being at all unusual,  showing that it was quite in  harmony
with His teachings.   He explains,  "Neither hath this man sinned,  nor his
parents; but that the works of (the) God should be made manifest in him."

    The  orthodox  interpretation is that the man was born blind  in  order
that Christ might have the opportunity of performing a miracle to show  His
power.  It  would  have  been  a  strange way for a God to  obtain  glory--




[PAGE 171]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

capriciously  condemning  a  man to many years of blindness and misery that
He might "show off" at a future time!  We would consider a man who acted in
such a manner a monster of cruelty.

    How  much more logical to think that there may be another  explanation.
To impute to God conduct which, in a human being,  we would denounce in the
strongest terms, in surely unreasonable.

    Christ differentiates between the physically blind body of the man  and
the God within, which is the Higher Self.

    The dense body has committed no sin.  The God within has done some deed
which  manifests in the particular affliction from which he  is  suffering.
It is not stretching a point to call a man a God.  Paul says,  "know ye not
that ye are Gods?  and he refers to the human body as the "temple of  God,"
the indwelling spirit.

    Finally,  although most people do not remember their past lives,  there
are some who do,  and all may know if they will live the life necessary  to
attain the knowledge.   This requires great strength of character,  because
such knowledge will carry with it a knowledge of impending fate that may be
hanging black and sinister over one, which will manifest in dire  disaster.
Nature has graciously hidden the past and the future from us,  that we  may
not be robbed of peace of mind by suffering in anticipation of the paid  in
store for us.   As we attain greater development we shall learn to  welcome
all things with equanimity,  seeing in all troubles the result of past evil
and  feeling thankful that the obligations incurred thereby are  being  an-
nulled,  knowing  that so much less stands between us and the day  of  lib-
eration from the wheel of birth and death.





[PAGE 172]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

    When a person dies in childhood in one life, he or she not infrequently
remembers  that life in the next body,  because children under 14 years  do
not journey around the entire life cycle,  which necessitates the  building
of a complete set of new vehicles.  They simply pass into the upper Regions
of  the  Desire World and there wait for a new  embodiment,  which  usually
takes place in from one to twenty years after death.   When they return  to
birth,  they bring with them the old mind and desire body,  and if we  lis-
tened to the prattle of children,  we should often able to discover and re-
construct such stories as the following

                            A REMARKABLE STORY.

    One day in Santa Barbara,  Cal., a man by the name of Roberts came to a
trained clairvoyant who is also a lecturer on Theosophy and asked for  help
in a perplexing case.   Mr. Roberts had been walking in the street the pre-
vious day when a little three-year old girl came up to him and put her arms
around his knees,  calling him papa.  Mr.  Roberts was indignant,  thinking
that someone was trying to father the child on him.   But the mother of the
child, who came up directly, was equally put out and tried to get the child
away.   The child,  however, kept on clinging to Mr. R.,  insisting that he
was her father.  On account of circumstances to be told later Mr. R.  could
not put it out of his mind, and sought out the clairvoyant, who accompanied
him to the house of the child's parents.  Where the girl at once ran up  to
Mr.  R.  and again called him papa.  The clairvoyant, whom I call X,  first
took the child over to the window to note whether the iris of the eye would
expand and contract when he turned her to and from the light,  in order  to
see  whether  another  entity  than  the  rightful  owner was in possession




[PAGE 173]                               REBIRTH AND THE LAW OF CONSEQUENCE

of the child's body,  for the eye is the window of the soul and no "obsess-
ing"  entity can secure control of that part.  Mr. X.  found however,  that
the  child was normal and next proceeded to question the little  one  care-
fully.   After patient work carried on intermittently during the afternoon,
so as not to tire the child, this is the story she told:

    She had lived with her papa, Mr. Roberts, and another mamma in a little
house that stood all alone, where no other house could be seen; there was a
little  brook close to the house where some flowers grew (and here she  ran
out  and brought in some "pussy-willows") and there was a plank across  the
brook  which she was cautioned against crossing,  for fear she  might  fall
into the brook.   One day her papa had left her mother and herself and  had
not returned.   When their supply of food was exhausted her mamma lay  down
on the bed and became so still.   At last she said quaintly,  "then I  also
died, but I didn't die.  I came here."

    Mr.  Roberts  next told his story.  Eighteen years before he  lived  in
London,  where his father was brewer.   He fell in love with their  servant
girl.   His father objected,  so he eloped with her to Australia after they
had  first  been married.   Here he went out into the bush  and  cleared  a
little farm,  where he erected a small cabin by a brook,  just as described
by the little girl.   A daughter was born to them there,  and when she  was
about  two years old he left the house one morning and went to  a  clearing
some distance from the house, and while there a man with a rifle came up to
him,  saying that he arrested him in the name of the law for a bank robbery
committed on the night Mr.  R.  had left England.   The officer had tracked
him here, thinking him the criminal.  Mr. R. begged  to be allowed to go to



[PAGE 174]                                 THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

his wife and child,  but, thinking this a ruse to entrap him into the hands
of  confederates,  the officer refused and drove him to the  coast  at  the
point  of  the gun.   He was taken to England and tried and  his  innocence
proven.

    First then did the authorities take heed of his constant ravings  about
his wife and child,  whom he knew must starve in that wild and lonely coun-
try.   An expedition was sent out to the cabin, when it was found that only
the skeletons of the wife and child remained.  Mr. Roberts' father had died
in the meantime, and though he had disinherited Mr. R. his brothers divided
with him and he came to America a broken man.

    He then produced photographs of himself and his wife,  and at the  sug-
gestion of Mr.  X.  they were mixed with a number of other photographs  and
shown to the little girl,  who unhesitatingly picked out the photographs of
both her alleged parents,  although the photograph shown was very different
from the present appearance of Mr. Roberts.

                        THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD

    In  the preceding chapters we have been considering man in  relation  to
three  of  the five Worlds which form the field of his evolution.   We  have
partly described these Worlds and noted the different vehicles of conscious-
ness by means of which he is correlated to them.   We have studied his rela-
tion  to the other three  Kingdoms--mineral,  plant and  animal--noting  the
difference in vehicles, and consequent difference in consciousness,  between
man and each of these Kingdoms.  We have followed man through one life cycle
in the three Worlds and have examined the operation of the twin laws of Con-
sequence and Rebirth in their bearing upon the evolution of man.

    In order to understand further details as to the progress of man, it now
becomes  necessary  to  study his relation to the  Grand  Architect  of  the
Universe--to God and to the Hierarchies of Celestial Beings which stand upon
the many different rungs of the Jacob's ladder of attainment that  stretches
from man to God and beyond.

    This is a task of the utmost difficulty,  rendered still more so by  the
indefinite  conceptions of God which exist in the minds of the  majority  of
the readers of literature dealing with this subject.  It is true that names,
in and of themselves, are not important, but it matters greatly that we know
what  we  mean  by  a  name;  other  wise  misunderstanding will result, and

[PAGE 179]                                        THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD

if  a  common nomenclature is not agreed upon by writers and  teachers,  the
present confusion will be worse confounded.  When the name "God"  is used it
is  always uncertain whether The Absolute, the One Existence,  is meant;  or
The Supreme Being, Who is the Great Architect of the Universe;  or God,  Who
is the Architect of our Solar system.

    The  division of the Godhead into "Father,"  "Son"  and "Holy Ghost"  is
also confusing.  Although the Beings designated by these names are immeasur-
ably above man and worthy of all the reverence and worship he is capable  of
rendering  to his highest conceptions of Divinity,  yet They  are  different
from one another in actual fact.

    Diagrams 6 and 11 will perhaps make the subject clear.   It must be kept
in  mind  that  the Worlds and Cosmic Planes are not one  above  another  in
space,  but that the seven Cosmic Planes inter-penetrate each other and  all
the seven Worlds.  They are states of spirit-matter, permeating one another,
so that God and the other great Beings who are mentioned are not far away in
space.   They pervade every part of their own realms and realms  of  greater
density than their own.   They are all present in our world and are actually
and  DE FACTO "nearer than hands and feet."   It is a literal truth when  we
say " in Him we live and move and have our being."  For none of us could ex-
ist outside these great Intelligences Who pervade and sustain our world with
Their  Life.
    It has been shown that the Etheric Region extends beyond  the atmosphere
of our dense Earth;  that the Desire World extends out  into  space  further
than the Etheric Region; also that the World of Thought extends further into
inter-planetary Space than either of the others.   Of course,  the Worlds of
rarer  substance  occupy  a  larger  space  than  the  denser  World,  which


[PAGE 180]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

has crystallized and condensed, thus occupying less space.

    The  same principle is operative in the Cosmic Planes.   The densest  of
them is the seventh (counting from the top downward).   It is represented in
the  diagram as larger than any of the others,  the reason being that it  is
the plane with which we are most intimately concerned, and it was desired to
indicate its principle subdivisions.  In reality, however,  it occupies less
space than any of the other Cosmic Planes, although it must be borne in mind
that,  even with this comparatively restrictive qualification as to its  ex-
tent,  it is still immeasurably vast, far beyond the utmost power of the hu-
man mind to conceive, comprising within its limits millions of Solar Systems
similar to our own, which are the fields for the evolution of many grades of
beings of approximately our own status.

    Of the six Cosmic Planes above our own we know nothing, save that we are
told they are the fields of activity of great Hierarchies of Beings of inde-
scribable splendor.

    Proceeding from our Physical World to the inner and finer worlds and  up
through the Cosmic Planes, we find that God, the Architect of our Solar Sys-
tem,  the Source and goal of our existence, is found in the highest division
of the seventh Cosmic Plane.  This is His World.

    His  realm  includes the systems of evolution carried on  in  the  other
planets which belong to our system--Uranus, Saturn,  Jupiter,  Mars,  Earth,
Venus, Mercury, and their satellites.

    The  great Spiritual Intelligences designated as the Planetary  Spirits,
which  guide  these evolutions,  are called the "Seven  Spirits  before  the
Throne."   They are His Ministers,  each presiding over a certain department
of the Kingdom of God--which is our  solar  System.  The  Sun  is  also  the


[PAGE 181]                                        THE RELATION OF MAN TO GOD

field of evolution of the most exalted Beings in our Cosmos.  They alone can
endure  and advance by means of the terrific solar vibrations.   The Sun  is
the  nearest approach we have to a visible symbol.   What That is cannot  be
uttered publicly.

    When we try to discover the origin of the Architect of our Solar System,
we find that we must pass to the highest of the seven Cosmic Planes.  We are
then in the Realm of the supreme Being, Who emanated from the Absolute.

    The Absolute is beyond comprehension.  No expression convey any adequate
idea.   Manifestation implies limitation.  Therefore, we may at best charac-
terize the Absolute as boundless Being; as the Root of Existence.

    From the root of Existence--The Absolute--proceeds the Supreme Being, at
the dawn of manifestation.  This is THE ONE.

    In the first chapter of John this Great Being is called God.   From this
Supreme  Being emanates The Word,  the Creative Fiat "without whom  was  not
anything made,"  and this Word is the alone-begotten Son, born of His father
(the Supreme Being) before all worlds--but positively NOT Christ.  Grand and
glorious as is Christ, towering high above mere human nature, He is not this
Exalted  Being.   Truly "the Word was made flesh,"  but not in  the  limited
sense of the flesh of one body,  but the flesh of all that is,  in this  and
millions of other solar Systems.

    The  first  Aspect of the Supreme Being may be characterized  as  POWER.
From this proceeds the Second Aspect, THE WORD;  and from both of these pro-
ceeds the Third, Aspect, MOTION.

    From this threefold Supreme Being proceed  the  seven  Great Logoi. They


[PAGE 182]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

contain within Themselves all the great Hierarchies which differentiate more
and  more as they diffuse through the various Cosmic Planes.   (See  diagram
6).   There  are forty-nine Hierarchies on the second Cosmic Plane;  on  the
third there are 343 Hierarchies.   Each of these is capable of septenary di-
visions and subdivisions, so that in the lowest Cosmic Plane,  where the So-
lar System manifest,  the number of divisions and subdivisions is almost in-
finite.

    In  the Highest World of the seventh Cosmic Plane dwells the God of  our
Solar  Systems in the Universe.   These great Beings are also  threefold  in
manifestation, like The Supreme Being.  Their three aspects are Will, Wisdom
and Activity.

    Each  of  the seven Planetary Spirits which proceeds from  God  and  has
charge of the evolution of life on one of the seven planets,  is also three-
fold and differentiates within itself Creative Hierarchies which go  through
a  septenary evolution.   The evolution carried on by one  Planetary  Spirit
differs from the methods of development inaugurated by each of the others.

    It  may  be further stated that, at least in  the  particular  planetary
scheme  to which we belong,  the entities farthest evolved in  the  earliest
stages,  who had reached a high stage of perfection in previous  evolutions,
assume  the  functions  of the original Planetary Spirit  and  continue  the
evolution,  the original Planetary Spirit withdrawing from active participa-
tion, but guiding its Regents.

    The  foregoing  is the teaching relative to all the Solar  Systems,  but
coming  down to the particular System to which we belong,  the following  is
the  teaching which the sufficiently trained Seer can obtain for himself  by
personal investigation of the memory of nature.


[PAGE 183]                                           THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION

                                CHAPTER VI.

                          THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION.

                               THE BEGINNING.

    In harmony with the Hermetic axiom "As above, so below"  and VICE VERSA,
Solar Systems are born, die and come to birth anew in cycles of activity and
rest, as does man.

    There is a constant flaming out and dying down of activity in every  de-
partment of nature,  corresponding to the alternations of ebb and flow,  day
and night, summer and winter, life and death.

    In  the beginning of a Day of Manifestation it is taught that a  certain
Great  Being  (designated in the Western World by the name of  God,  but  by
other names in other parts of the earth) limits Himself to a certain portion
of space,  in which He elects to create a Solar System for the evolution  of
added self-consciousness.  (See diagram 6).

    He  includes in His own Being hosts of glorious Hierarchies of,  to  us,
immeasurable  spiritual power and splendor.   They are the fruitage of  past
manifestations of this same Being and also other Intelligences,  in descend-
ing degrees of development down to such as have not reached a stage of  con-
sciousness as high as our present humanity,  and therefore these latter will
not be able to finish their evolution in this  System.  In  God--this  great


[PAGE 184]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

collective Being--there are contained lesser beings of every grade of intel-
ligence  and stage of consciousness, from omniscience to an  unconsciousness
deeper than that of the deepest trance condition.

    During  the period of manifestation with which we are  concerned,  these
various  grades of beings are working to acquire more experience  than  they
possessed at the beginning of this period of existence.  Those who,  in pre-
vious  manifestations,  have attained to the highest degree  of  development
work  on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.   They induce  in
them  a  stage  of  self-consciousness.   They induce in  them  a  stage  of
self-consciousness  from  which they can take up  further  work  themselves.
Those who had started their evolution in a former Day of Manifestation,  but
had not progressed far at the close,  now take up their task again,  just as
we  take  up our daily work in the morning where we left  off  the  previous
night.

    All the different Beings, however, do not take up their evolution at the
early stages of a new manifestation.  Some must wait until those who precede
them have made the conditions which are necessary for their further develop-
ment.   There are no instantaneous processes in nature.   All is an  exceed-
ingly slow unfolding,  a development which,  though so exceedingly slow,  is
yet  absolutely certain to attain ultimate perfection.   Just as  there  are
progressive stages in the human life--childhood,  youth,  manhood or  woman-
hood,  and  old age--so in the macrocosm there are different  stages  corre-
sponding to these various periods of the microcosmic life.

    A child cannot take up the duties of fatherhood or motherhood.   Its un-
developed  mental and physical condition render it incapable of  doing  such
work.  The same is true of the  less  evolved beings  in  the  beginning  of


[PAGE 185]                                           THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION

manifestation.  They must wait until the higher evolved have made the proper
conditions for them.   The lower the grade of the intelligence of the evolv-
ing being, the more it is dependent upon outside help.

    At the Beginning,  then,  the highest Beings--those who are the farthest
evolved--work  upon those who have the greatest degree  of  unconsciousness.
Later,  they  turn them over to some of the less evolved entities,  who  are
then able to carry the work a little further.   At least  self-consciousness
is awakened.  The evolving life has become Man.

    From the point where the self-conscious individual Ego has come into be-
ing he must go on and expand his consciousness without outside help.   Expe-
rience  and thought are then to take the place of outside teachers  and  the
glory, power and splendor he may attain are limitless.

    The  period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness  and
to  the building of the vehicles through which the spirit in man  manifests,
is called "Involution."

    The  subsequent period of existence, during which the  individual  human
being develops self-consciousness into divine omniscience, is called "Evolu-
tion."

    The Force within the evolving being which makes evolution what it is and
not  a  mere unfoldment of latent germinal possibilities;  which  makes  the
evolution of each individual differ from that of every other; which provides
the element of originality and gives scope to the creative ability which the
evolving  being  is  to cultivate that he may become a  God--that  Force  is
called  "Genius,"   and  as  previously  explained,   its  manifestation  is
"Epigenesis."

    Many  of the advanced philosophies of modern times recognize  involution
and  evolution.   Science recognizes only the latter,  because it  (Science)
deals only with  the  Form  side of  manifestation.  Involution  belongs  to


[PAGE 186]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the Life side;  but the most advanced scientists regard Epigenesis as a  de-
monstrable  fact.   The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception combines all  three  as
necessary to full understanding of the past,  present and future development
of the System to which we belong.

                                THE WORLDS.

    We  might use a homely instance to illustrate the building of a  Cosmos.
Suppose a man wants to establish a home in which to live.   He first selects
a  suitable location and then proceeds to build a house,  dividing  it  into
various  rooms to serve certain purpose.   He makes a  kitchen,  dining-room
bedrooms  and bathroom,  and furnishes them all to suit the special  purpose
they are intended to serve.

    When God desires to create,  He seeks out an appropriate place in space,
which  He  fills  with  His  aura,  permeating  every  atom  of  the  cosmic
root-substance of that particular portion of space with His Life, thus awak-
ening the activity latent within every INseparate atom.

    This Cosmic Root-substance is an expression of the negative pole of  the
Universal Spirit, while the great Creative Being we call God (of whom we, as
spirits,  are part) is an expression of the positive energy of the same Uni-
versal Absolute Spirit.   From the work of one upon the other,  all that  we
see about us in the Physical World has resulted.  The oceans,  the Earth ev-
erything  we see manifesting as mineral,  plant animal and human  forms--all
are CRYSTALLIZED SPACE, emanated from this negative Spirit-substance,  which
alone existed at the dawn of Being.   As surely as the hard and flinty house
of the snail is the solidified juices of its soft body,  so surely all FORMS
are crystallizations around the negative pole of Spirit.


[PAGE 187]                                           THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION

    God  draws from the Cosmic Root-substance outside His immediate  sphere;
thus  the substance within the nascent cosmos becomes denser than it  is  in
Universal space, between Solar Systems.

    When God has thus prepared the material for His Habitation, He next sets
it in order.  Every part of the system is pervaded by His consciousness, but
different modification of that consciousness in each part of division.   The
Cosmic Root-substance is set in varying rates of vibration and is  therefore
differently constituted in its various divisions, or regions.

    The above is the manner in which the Worlds come into being and are fit-
ted to serve different purposes in the evolutionary scheme,  the same as the
various rooms in the house are fitted to serve the purpose of everyday  life
in the Physical World.

    We  have already seen that there are seven Worlds.   These  Worlds  have
each a different "measure" and rate of vibration.  In the densest World (the
Physical) the measure of vibration, though in the case of light-waves reach-
ing a rate of hundreds of millions per second, is nevertheless infinitesimal
when compared to the rapidity of the vibration in the Desire World, which is
next to the Physical.  To get some conception of the meaning and rapidity of
vibration,  perhaps the easiest way is to watch the heat  vibrations  rising
from a very hot stove, or from a steam radiator near a window.

    It must be borne constantly in mind that these Worlds are not  separated
by  space  or distance,  as is the earth from the other planets.   They  are
states of matter, of varying density and vibration, as are the solids,  liq-
uids and gases of our Physical World.   These Worlds are not instantaneously
created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they  last  until


[PAGE 188]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the end;  but as a spider spins its web thread by thread, so god differenti-
ates one after another of the worlds within Himself, as the necessity arises
for new conditions in the scheme of evolution in which He is engaged.   Thus
have  all  the  seven Worlds been gradually differentiated as  they  are  at
present.

    The  highest  Worlds are created first, and as involution is  to  slowly
carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms,  the
finer Worlds gradually condense and new Worlds are differentiated within God
to  furnish  the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds  which  have
consolidated.  In due time the point of greatest density, the nadir of mate-
riality,  is reached.  From that point the life begins to ascend into higher
Worlds,  as evolution proceeds.   That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated,
one by one.   When the purpose has been served for which a particular  World
was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous,  by ceas-
ing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sus-
tained that World.

    The highest (finest, rarest, most ethereal) Worlds are the first created
and  the  last  eliminated,  while the three densest Worlds,  in  which  our
present phase of evolution is carried on,  are but comparatively  evanescent
phenomena incident to the spirit's dip into matter.

                             THE SEVEN PERIODS.

    The  evolutionary scheme is carried through these five Worlds  in  seven
great Periods of Manifestation, during which the virgin spirit,  or evolving
life, becomes first, man--then, a God.

    At the beginning of Manifestation God differentiates  within  (not FROM)


[PAGE 189]                                           THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION

Himself these virgin spirits,  as sparks from a Flame,  of the same  nature,
capable  of being fanned into Flames themselves.   Evolution is the  fanning
process which is to accomplish that end.  In the virgin spirits are enfolded
all the possibilities of their Divine Father, including the germ of indepen-
dent Will, which makes them capable of originating new phases, not latent in
them.   The  latent possibilities are transformed into  dynamic  powers  and
available faculties during evolution,  while the independent Will institutes
new and original departures--or Epigenesis.

    Prior  to  the  beginning of the pilgrimage through  matter  the  virgin
spirit  is in the World of Virgin Spirits,  the next to the highest  of  the
seven  Worlds.   It has Divine Consciousness,  but  NOT  SELF-consciousness.
That, Soul-power, and the Creative Mind, are faculties or powers attained to
by evolution.

    When the virgin spirit is immersed in the World of Divine Spirit,  it is
blinded and rendered utterly unconscious by that matter.  It is as oblivious
to outside conditions as is man when in the deepest trance.   This state  of
unconsciousness prevails during the first period.

    In the Second Period it rises to the dreamless sleep state; in the third
Period it reaches the dream stage,  and in the middle of the Fourth  Period,
at  which we have now arrived,  the full waking consciousness of man is  at-
tained.   This  is a consciousness pertaining to only the lowest one of  the
seven  Worlds.   During the remaining half of this Period,  and  the  entire
three remaining Periods,  man must expand his consciousness so as to include
all of the six Worlds above this Physical World.

    When  man passed through these Worlds in his descent his  energies  were
directed by higher Beings, who  assisted  him  to  turn  unconscious  energy


[PAGE 190]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

INWARD for the building of proper vehicles.  At last, when he was far enough
advanced  and  equipped with the threefold body as a  necessary  instrument,
these higher Beings "opened his eyes"  and turned his gaze OUTWARD upon  the
Chemical Region of the Physical World, that his energies might conquer it.

    When he has fitted himself by his work in the Chemical Region,  his next
step in progress will be toward an expansion in consciousness that will  in-
clude the Etheric Region; then the Desire World, etc., etc.

    In  the Rosicrucian terminology,  the names of the seven Periods are  as
follows:

1.  The Saturn Period
2.  The Sun Period
3.  the Moon Period           These periods are successive Rebirths
4.  The Earth Period          of our Earth.
5.  The Jupiter Period
6.  The Venus Period
7.  The Vulcan Period

    It must not be thought that the above mentioned Periods have anything to
do  with  the planets which move in their orbits around the sun  in  company
with the earth.  In fact, it cannot be too emphatically stated that there is
no connection whatever between these planets and the periods.   The  Periods
are simply past,  present or future incarnations of our Earth,  "conditions"
through which it has passed, is now passing, or will pass in the future.

    The  three first mentioned Periods (the Saturn,  Sun and  Moon  Periods)
have been passed through.  We are now in the fourth, or Earth Period.   When
this Earth Period of our Globe has been completed,  we and it shall pass in,
turn  through  the Jupiter,  Venus and Vulcan conditions  before  the  great
septenary Day of Manifestation comes to an end, when all that  now  is  will


[PAGE 191]                                           THE SCHEME OF EVOLUTION

once more be merged in the Absolute for a period of rest and assimilation of
the fruits of our evolution, to re-emerge for further and higher development
at the dawn of another Great Day.

    The  three  and one-half Periods already behind us have  been  spent  in
gaining  our  present vehicles and consciousness.  The remaining  three  and
one-half Periods will be devoted to perfecting these different vehicles  and
expanding our consciousness into something akin to omniscience.

    The  journey  made by the virgin spirit from  unconsciousness  to  omni-
science, unfolding its latent possibilities into a kinetic energy, is a pro-
cess  of  marvelous complexity and progress in our present outline  will  at
first be given.  As we progress in our present study, however,  more details
will be filled in,  until the picture is a complete as the writer is capable
of making it.   The attention of the student is called to the definition  of
terms that are given as new ideas are being presented.   He is earnestly im-
portuned  to familiarize himself with them, as the intention is to  simplify
the  matter  by  using  only one familiar English name  for  the  same  idea
throughout  the work.   The name will be as descriptive as possible  of  the
idea  to be conveyed,  in multiplex terminology may be avoided.   By  paying
strict attention to definition of terms,  it should not be too difficult for
any  person of average intelligence to acquire a knowledge of at  least  the
outlines of the scheme of evolution.

    That  such a knowledge is of the utmost importance will,  we  think,  be
conceded by every intelligent individual.   We live in this world,  governed
by the laws of nature.   Under these laws we must live and work,  and we are
powerless to change them.  If we know them and intelligently co-operate with


[PAGE 192]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

with them,  these nature-forces become most valuable servants,  e.g.,  elec-
tricity and the expansive force of steam.  If, on the other hand,  we do not
understand  them and in our ignorance work,  contrary to them,  they  become
most dangerous enemies, capable of terrible destruction.

    Therefore,  the  more we know of the working methods  of  nature,  which
latter  is but the visible symbol of the invisible God,  the better able  we
shall  be  to take advantage of the opportunities it offers for  growth  and
power; for emancipation from bondage and for elevation to mastery.

                          THE PATH OF EVOLUTION.

   A word of warning in regard to diagrams used for purposes of illustration
may not be out of place.   The student should remember that anything that is
reduced  into  another dimension can never be accurate.   The picture  of  a
house  would mean little or nothing to us if we had never seen a house.   In
that  case  we would see in the picture only lines and blotches.   It  would
convey no meaning to us.  Diagrams used to illustrate super physical matters
are  much less true representations of the reality,  for the  simple  reason
that in the case of the picture, the three-dimensional house is only reduced
to two dimensions, while in the case of diagrams of the Periods,  Worlds and
Globes, the realities possess from four to seven dimension, and the diagrams
of  two dimensions by which it is endeavored to represent them are  thus  so
much further removed from the possibility of correctly portraying them.   We
must  constantly  bear in mind that these Worlds inter-penetrate,  that  the
Globes  inter-penetrate,  and that the way they are shown in the diagram  is
analogous  to taking all the wheels of a watch and laying them side by  side
in order to show how the watch keeps time.   If these diagrams are to be  of

[PAGE 195]                                             THE PATH OF EVOLUTION

                       REVOLUTIONS AND COSMIC NIGHTS

   The  Saturn Period is the first of the seven Periods,  and at this  early
stage the virgin spirits take their first step towards the evolution of Con-
sciousness  and Form.   By reference to diagram 7 it will be seen  that  the
evolutionary impulse travels seven times around the seven Globes, A,  B,  C,
D, E, F and G, the arrows showing the direction.

   First,  a part of the evolution is accomplished on Globe A,  situated  in
the  World of Divine Spirit,  the rarest of the five Worlds which  form  our
field  of evolution.   Then,  gradually the evolving life is transferred  to
Globe B, which is located in the somewhat denser World of Life Spirit.  Here
another stage of evolution is passed through.  In due time the evolving life
is ready to enter the arena on Globe C,  which is situated in and formed  of
the yet denser substance of the Region of Abstract Thought.   After learning
the lessons peculiar to that stage of existence,  the life wave travels  on-
ward to Globe D,  which is located in and formed of the substance of the Re-
gion of Concrete Thought.   This is the densest degree of matter reached  by
the life wave during the Saturn Period.

   From  this point the life wave is carried upward again to Globe E,  which
is situated in the Region of Abstract Thought, as is Globe C, yet the condi-
tions are not the same as on Globe C.  This is the Involutionary stage,  and
the substance of the Worlds is getting denser all the time.  The tendency in
everything is to become denser and more solid as times goes on; also, as the
path of evolution is a spiral, it will be clear that, though the same points
are gone over,  the conditions are never the same,  but are on a higher  and
more advanced plane.

   When the work on Globe E has been completed,  the  next  step is taken on


[PAGE 196]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Globe F, which is situated in the World of Life Spirit, the same as Globe B;
thence it mounts to Globe G.  When the work there is done, the life wave has
traveled once around all the seven Globes; once down and up through the four
respective  Worlds.   This journey of life wave is called a Revolution,  and
seven Revolutions make one Period.   During one Period the life wave travels
seven times down and up through the four Worlds.

   When the life wave has traveled its full complement of seven times around
the seven times around the seven Globes,  completing the seven  Revolutions,
the  first Day of Creation closes and there follows a Cosmic Night  of  rest
and assimilation, after which the Sun Period dawns.

   Like  the night of sleep between two days of human life and the  interval
of rest between two earth lives, this Cosmic Night of rest after the comple-
tion of the Saturn Period is not a time of passive repose,  but a season  of
preparation for the activity to be unfolded in the coming Sun Period,  where
man-in-the-making  is  to take a further dip into  matter.   Therefore,  new
Globes are necessary, the positions of which in the seven Worlds are differ-
ent from those occupied by the Worlds of the Saturn Period.   The  providing
of these new Globes,  and other subjective activities,  occupy the  evolving
spirits during the interval between Periods--the Cosmic Night.   The  manner
of procedure is as follows:

   When  the  life wave has left Globe A in the Saturn Period for  the  last
tine,  the Globe begins to slowly disintegrate.   The forces which built  it
are  transferred from the World of Divine Spirit (where Globe A  is  located
during the Saturn Period) to the World of Life Spirit (where Globe A is  lo-
cated during the Sun Period).  This is shown on diagram 8.

[PAGE 198]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   When  the  life wave has left Globe B in the Saturn Period for  the  last
time,  it also commences to disintegrate, and the forces thereof,  like  the
seed-atom of a human vehicle,  are used as a nucleus for Globe B in the  Sun
Period, this Globe being then located in the Region of Abstract Thought.

   In  like  manner the forces of Globe C are transferred to the  Region  of
Concrete Thought and draw upon the substance of that Region for the material
wherewith  to  build a new Globe C for the coming Sun Period.   Globe  D  is
similarly transmuted and placed in the Desire World.  Globes E, F, and G, in
order named,  are analogously transferred.   The result is (as reference  to
diagram  8 will show) that in the Sun Period all the Globes are located  one
step further down into denser matter that they were in the Saturn Period, so
that the life wave,  upon its emergence from the Cosmic Night of Rest inter-
vening between the last activity on Globe G of the Saturn Period and the re-
newed  activity on Globe A of the Sun Period finds a new  environment,  with
the opportunity thus afforded for new experiences.

   The life wave now circles seven times around the seven Globes during  the
Sun Period,  tranversing seven times down and up the four Worlds or  Regions
in  which these Globes are located.   It makes seven Revolutions in the  Sun
Period, as it did in the Saturn Period.

   When  the life wave leaves Globe A in the Sun Period for the  last  time,
that Globe begins to disintegrate.  Its forces are transferred to the denser
Region of Abstract Thought,  where they form a planet to be used during  the
Moon  Period.   In the same way,  the forces of the other Globes are  trans-
ferred  and serve as nuclei for the Globes of the Moon Period,  as shown  in
diagram  8,   the  process  being  exactly  the  same  as  when  the  Globes


[PAGE 199]                                             THE PATH OF EVOLUTION

are removed from their locations in the Saturn Period to the positions  they
occupied  during  the Sun Period.   Thus the Globes of the Moon  Period  are
placed one step further down in matter that they were during the Sun Period,
the  lowest (Globe D) being situated in the Etheric Region of  the  Physical
World.

   After the interim of Cosmic Night between the Sun Period and the Moon Pe-
riod,  the life wave starts its course on Globe A of the latter,  completing
in due time its seven Revolutions, as before.   Then there is another Cosmic
Night,  during which the Globes are again transferred one step further down,
and  this  time the densest Globe is located in the Chemical Region  of  the
Physical World, as reference to diagram 8 will show.

   This,  then,  is the Earth Period and the lowest and densest Globe (Globe
D) is our present Earth.

   The life wave here, as usual, started on Globe A,  after the Cosmic Night
succeeding  the  Moon Period.   In the present Earth Period it  has  circled
three  times around the seven globes and is now on Globe D,  in  its  fourth
Revolution.

   Here on earth and in this present fourth Revolution, the greatest density
of  matter--the nadir of materiality--was reached a few millions years  ago.
The  tendency  henceforth will be upward into rarer substance.   During  the
three  and  one-half Revolutions which remain to complete this  Period,  the
condition of the Earth will gradually become more and more ethereal,  and in
the  next--the Jupiter Period--Globe D will again be located in the  Etheric
Region,  as it was in the Moon Period,  the other Globes being also elevated
correspondingly.

   In the Venus  Period  they will be located in the same Worlds as were the


[PAGE 200]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Globes  of the Sun Period.   The Globes of the Vulcan Period will  have  the
same  density  and be located in the same Worlds as were the Globes  of  the
Saturn Period.  This is all shown on diagram 8.

   When  the  life wave has completed its work in the Earth Period  and  the
Cosmic Night which follows in past, it will go through its seven Revolutions
on the Globes of the Jupiter Period.  Then will come the usual Cosmic Night,
with its subjective activities; after which the seven Revolutions of the Ve-
nus Period;  then another rest,  succeeded by the last of the Periods of the
present  scheme of evolution--the Vulcan Period.   The life wave also  makes
its  seven Revolutions here,  and at the end of the last Revolution all  the
Globes are dissolved and the life wave is reabsorbed by God, for a period of
time  equal in duration to that occupied by all the seven Periods of  activ-
ity.   God Himself then merges into the Absolute during the Universal  Night
of assimilation and preparation for another Great Day.

   Other and grander evolutions will then follow,  but we can deal only with
the seven Periods described.

                               CHAPTER VIII.

                          THE WORK OF EVOLUTION.

                             ARIADNE'S THREAD.

   Having become acquainted with the Worlds,  the Globes and the Revolutions
which constitute the path of evolution during the seven Periods,  we are now
in a position to consider the work which is done in each Period,  as well as
the methods employed to accomplish it.

   The  "Ariadne's thread"  which will guide us through the maze of  Globes,
Worlds, Revolutions and Periods will be found when it is remembered and kept
steadily in mind that the virgin spirits which constitute the evolving  life
wave become entirely UNCONSCIOUS when they commenced their evolutionary pil-
grimage through the five Worlds of substance denser than the World of Virgin
Spirits.   The purpose of evolution is to make them fully conscious and able
to master the matter of all the Worlds, therefore the conditions embodied in
Globes, Worlds, Revolutions and Periods are ordered with that end in view.

   During the Saturn,  Sun and Moon Periods and the past half of the present
Earth Period,  the virgin spirits have unconsciously built their  difference
vehicles  under the direction of exalted Beings who guided  their  progress,
and  have gradually awakened until they have attained the present  state  of
waking consciousness.  This period is called "Involution".

   From the present time to  the  end  of  the  Vulcan  Period,  the  virgin


[PAGE 202]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

spirits,  who are now our humanity, will perfect their vehicles  and  expand
their  consciousness  in the five Worlds by their own  efforts  and  genius.
This period is called "Evolution."

   The above is the key to the understanding of what follows.

   A  thorough comprehension of the scheme of planetary evolution which  has
been  outlines  in the preceding pages is of immense value to  the  student.
Although some believers in the laws of Consequence and Rebirth seem to think
that  the possession of such knowledge is quite non-essential and of  little
use,  it is nevertheless of very great importance to the earnest student  of
these  two  laws.   It trains the mind in abstract thought and  elevates  it
above  the sordid things of concrete existence,  helping the imagination  to
soar beyond the hampering toils of self-interest.  As stated in our study of
the Desire World,  Interest is the mainspring to action,  yet at our present
stage  of  progress,  Interest is generally aroused by selfishness.   It  is
sometimes of a very subtle nature,  but it spurs to action of various kinds.
All  action inspired by Interest generates certain effects which act on  us,
and  in  consequence we are bound by action having to do with  the  concrete
Worlds.  But, if our minds are occupied with such subjects as mathematics or
study  of the planetary phases of evolution, we are in the Region of  purely
Abstract Thought,  beyond the influence of Feeling, and the mind is directed
upward towards the spiritual realism and liberation.  When we are extracting
cube  root,  or multiplying figures, or thinking  of  Periods,  Revolutions,
etc.,  we have no Feeling about it.  We do not quarrel about twice two being
four.   If our feelings were involved we should perhaps try to make it  five
and quarrel with the one who,  for personal reasons,  said it was but three,


[PAGE 203]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

but in mathematics Truth is most clearly apparent and Feeling is eliminated.
Therefore, to the average man, desiring to live in the feelings, mathematics
is dry and uninteresting.  Pythagoras taught his pupils to live in the World
of  Eternal Spirit and he demanded that those who desired  instruction  from
his  should  first study   A mind capable of  understanding  mathematics  is
above the average and is capable of rising into the World of Spirit, because
it is not fettered in the World of Feeling and Desire.  The more we accustom
ourselves to think in terms of the Spiritual Worlds,  the better we shall be
able  to rise above the illusions which surround us in this concrete  exist-
ence,  where the twin feelings, Interest and Indifference, obscure the Truth
and bias us,  as the reflection of the light rays through the Earth's  atmo-
sphere  gives  us incorrect ideas of the position of the  luminary  emitting
them.

   Therefore the student who wishes to know Truth;  to enter and investigate
the realms of Spirit;  to free himself from the toils of the flesh,  as rap-
idly as is consistent with safety and proper growth, is earnestly advised to
study what follows as throughly as possible;  to assimilate it and draw men-
tal  conceptions  of these Worlds,  Globes and Periods.   If  he  wishes  to
progress in this way,  the study of mathematics and of Hinton's "The  Fourth
Dimension"  are also admirable exercises in abstract thought.   This work of
Hinton's  (though basically incorrect, because the  four-dimensional  Desire
World cannot be actually found by three-dimensional methods), has opened the
eyes  of  several persons who have studied it,  and made  them  clairvoyant.
Moreover,  remembering  that logic is the nest teacher in any world,  it  is
certain that the individual who succeeds in entering into the  superphysical
World by means of such studies in abstract thought, will not become confused


[PAGE 204]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

but will be able to give a good account of himself under all circumstances.

   A  stupendous  scheme is here unfolded,  and as more and more  detail  is
filled in,  its complexity becomes almost inconceivable.   Anyone capable of
comprehending it will be well rewarded for taking the utmost pains to do so.
Therefore,  the student should read slowly,  repeat often,  think deeply and
much.

   This book,  particularly this chapter, cannot be read in a casual manner.
Every sentence has weight and bearing upon what follows,  and presupposes  a
knowledge  of what precedes it.   If the books is not studied throughly  and
systematically,  it will grown more and more incomprehensible and  confusing
with every page.   On the other hand,  if it is studied and well thought out
as the student proceeds,  it will be found that each page is illuminated  by
the increased knowledge gained by study of what went before.

   No work of this kind,  dealing with the deepest phases of the Great World
Mystery that the human mind, at its present stage of development, it capable
of grasping,  can be written in such a manner that it will be light reading.
Yet  the deepest phases now comprehensible to use are but the A B C  of  the
scheme  as it will be revealed to us when our minds have become  capable  of
understanding more, in later stages of our development as Supermen.

                            THE SATURN PERIOD.

   The  Globes of the Saturn Period consisted of much rarer and  finer  sub-
stances than our Earth, as it will be evident from a study of diagrams 7 and
8, which the student is advised to keep close at hand for frequent reference
while studying this subject.  The densest Globe  of  that Period was located


[PAGE 205]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

in the same portion of the World of Thought occupied by the rarest of Globes
of the present Period--the Region of Concrete Thought.   These Globes had no
consistency  such  as we can sense.   "Warmth"  is the only  word  that  ap-
proximates  the idea of the ancient Saturn Period.   It was dark;  and if  a
person  could have entered into the space it occupied,  he would  have  seen
nothing.  All about him would have been darkness, but he would have felt its
warmth.

   To the materialist it will,  of course, seem insanity to call such a con-
dition a "Globe",  and to assert that it was the field of evolution of  Form
and Life.  Yet, when we consider the Nebular Theory, we can realize that the
nebula  must have been dark before it glowed with light,  and that  it  must
have  been  hot  before it could become fiery.   This heat  must  have  been
brought about by motion, and motion is life.

   We  may say that the virgin spirits who were to evolve consciousness  and
form were embedded in this Globe,  or perhaps better,  that the whole  Globe
was composed of virgin spirits,  as a raspberry is made of a great number of
small  raspberries.   They  were  incorporated in the  Globe,  as  the  life
ensouling  the mineral is in our Earth.   Therefore it is said among  occult
scientists that in the Saturn Period man went through the mineral stage.

   Outside  this "warmth-Globe"--in its atmosphere,  we might say--were  the
great creative Hierarchies,  who were to help the evolving virgin spirits to
develop form and consciousness.   There were many Hierarchies,  but for  the
present we shall concern ourselves with the principal ones only--those which
did the most important work of the Saturn Period.

   In the Rosicrucian terminology these are called "Lords of the Flame," be-
cause of the brilliant luminosity of their bodies and their great bodies and


[PAGE 206]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

their great spiritual powers.  They are called "Thrones"  in the Bible,  and
worked on man of their own free will.   They were so far advanced that  this
evolutionary manifestation could give them no new experiences, and therefore
no added wisdom, and the same may be said of two still higher order of Hier-
archies,  to be named later.  The rest of the creative Hierarchies, in order
to complete their own evolutions, were compelled to work  on,  in  and  with
man.

   These  Lords  of the Flame were outside the dark Saturn Globe  and  their
bodies emitted a strong light.   They, so to say,  projected their  pictures
upon the surface of that ancient Saturn Globe,  which was so  impressionable
that it reflected,  in a multiple or echo-like manner,  everything that came
in contact with it, giving back the images manifolded.  (This is told in the
Greek myth wherein it is said that Saturn destroyed his children.)

   However,  by repeated efforts during the first Revolution,  the Lords  of
the  Flame succeeded in implanting in the evolving life the germ  which  has
developed our present dense body.   This germ was somewhat developed  during
the remainder of the first six Revolutions, being given the capacity for de-
veloping the senses organs, particularly the ear.  Therefore, the ear is the
most highly developed organ we possess.  It is the instrument which  carries
with the greatest accuracy the impressions of outside conditions to the con-
sciousness.   It is less subject to the illusions of the Physical World that
the other sense organs.

   The  consciousness of the evolving life of that Period was like  that  of
the mineral of today--a state of unconsciousness similar to that attained by
mediums  in  the deepest trance--yet during the first six  Revolutions,  the
evolving life worked on the germ of the dense body under the  direction  and


[PAGE 207]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

with the help of the different creative Hierarchies.   In the  middle of the
seventh  Revolution  the Lords of the Flame,  Who had  been since  They gave
the germ of the dense  body in the first  Revolution,  again become  active,
this time to awaken the highest spiritual principle.   They aroused the ini-
tial activity of the divine spirit in man.

   Thus, man owes his highest and lowest vehicles--the divine spirit and the
dense body to the evolution of the Saturn Period.   These,  the Lords of the
Flame  of their own free will helped him to manifest,  not being  under  the
slightest compulsion to do so.

   The  work of the various creative Hierarchies is not started on Globe  A,
at the commencement of a Period or a Revolution.  It commences in the middle
of one Revolution,  growing in strength and reaching its highest  efficiency
in the middle of the Cosmic Night--which is between Revolutions,  as well as
between Periods.   Then it gradually declines, as the life wave sweeps on to
the middle of the next Revolution.

   Thus  the work of the Lords of the Flame in awakening the  germinal  con-
sciousness, was most active and efficient during the rest Period between the
Saturn and Sun Periods.

   We reiterate that a Cosmic Night is not to be regarded as a time of inac-
tivity.   It is not inert existence, as we saw in the case of the individual
passing  from  death to a new birth.   So with the great death  of  all  the
Globes of a Period.  It is a cessation of active manifestation,  that a pro-
portionately keener subjective activity may be unfolded.

   Perhaps  the best idea of the nature of this subjective activity  may  be
gained by observing what happens when a ripe fruit is buried  in the ground.


[PAGE 208]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Fermentation and decay of the flesh sets in, but out of that chaos comes the
new plant,  sprouting forth into the air and sunshine.  So, when a Period is
past, all is resolved into conglomerate chaos, apparently incapable of being
reduced to order.   At the proper time, however,  the Globes of a new period
are formed and made ready for occupancy as man-bearing Worlds.   Hither  the
evolving life is transferred from five dark Globes which it traverses during
the Cosmic Night, to commence the activities of a new creative day in an al-
tered  environment,  prepared and externalized during the activities of  the
Cosmic Night.  As the forces of fermentation in the fruit stimulate the seed
and  fertilize  the  soil  in which it grows,  so the  Lords  of  the  Flame
stimulated the germ of divine spirit,  particularly during the Cosmic  Night
between  the Saturn and Sun Periods,  continuing their activities until  the
middle of the first Revolution of the Sun Period.

                              RECAPITULATION.

   Before the activity in any Period can be started,  there is a recapitula-
tion of all that has been gone through before.   Owing to the spiral path of
evolution,  this activity takes place each time on a higher scale  that  the
stage in progression which it rehearses.  The necessity will become apparent
when the actual work in recapitulation is described.

   The  first Revolution of any Period is a recapitulation of the work  upon
the dense body in the Saturn Period, and is spoken of among Rosicrucians  as
the "Saturn Revolution."

   The Second Period is the Sun Period,  and therefore the second Revolution
of any Period subsequent to the Sun Period would be the "Sun Revolution."


[PAGE 209]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

   The  third Period is the Moon Period,  therefore the third Revolution  of
any subsequent Period will be a recapitulation of the work done in the  Moon
Period, and is called the "Moon Revolution."

   Not until after the recapitulatory Revolutions does the proper work of  a
Period begin.   For instance,  in the present Earth Period,  we have  passed
through  three and one-half Revolutions.   That means that in the first,  or
Saturn  Revolution of the Earth Period,  the work done in the Saturn  Period
was repeated,  but on an advanced scale.  In the second,  or Sun Revolution,
the work of the Sun Period was gone through again.   In the third,  or  Moon
Revolution, the work of the Moon Period was repeated; and it was only in the
fourth--the present Revolution--the real work of the Earth Period commenced.

   In  the  last  of the seven Periods--the  Vulcan  Period--only  the  last
Revolution  will be concerned with real Vulcan work.   In the preceding  six
Revolutions  the  work  of the preceding six Periods will  have  been  reca-
pitulated.

   Moreover  (and  this will particularly help the student to  remember),  a
Saturn  Revolution  in any Period has always to do with the  development  of
some  new  feature of the dense body, because that was started  in  a  first
Revolution;  and ANY seventh,  or Vulcan Revolution,  has for its particular
work  some activity in connection with the divine spirit,  because that  was
started in a seventh Revolution.   In the same way,  we shall see that there
is  a  connection  between the different Revolutions and all the vehicles of
man.

                              THE SUN PERIOD.

   Conditions  during  the Sun Period differed radically from those  of  the
Saturn Period.  Instead of  the  "warmth-Globes"  of  the  latter,  the  Sun


[PAGE 210]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Period  Globes were glowing light-balls,  of the consistency of gas.   These
great gasballs contained all that had been evolved in the Saturn Period, and
similarly, in the atmosphere were the creative Hierarchies.

   Instead of the echo-like, reflecting quality of the Saturn Period,  these
Globes,  to some extent, had the quality of absorbing and working over sight
or  sound  projected against their surfaces.   They,  as it  were,  "sensed"
things.   The Earth does not seem to do this,  and a materialist would scoff
at the idea,  yet the occultist knows that the Earth feels everything on and
in it.   This lighter Globe was much more sensitive that the Earth,  because
it was not limited and bound in such hard and fast conditions of materiality
as is our present habitat.

   The  life,  of course,  was different,  because no forms such as we  know
could have existed there.  But life can express itself in forms of fiery gas
as  well as--in fact better than--in forms of hard chemical matter  such  as
the present dense forms of mineral, plant, animal and man.

   As the evolving life appeared upon Globe A in the first or Saturn Revolu-
tion  of the Sun Period,  it was still in charge of the Lords of  the  Flame
who,  in the middle of the last Revolution of the Saturn Period, awakened in
man the germ of the divine spirit.

   They  had previously given the germ of the dense body and,  in the  first
half of the Saturn Revolution of the Sun Period, were concerned with certain
improvements to be made upon it.

   In  the Sun Period the formation of the vital body was to  be  commenced,
with  all thereby implied of capability for assimilation,  growth,  propaga-
tion, glands, etc.

   The Lords of the Flame incorporated in the germ of the  dense  body  only


[PAGE 211]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

the  capability of evolving sense organs.  At the time now  under  consider-
ation  it became necessary to change the germ in such a way as to  allow  of
interpenetration by a vital body,  also capability of evolving glands and an
alimentary  canal.   This was done by the joint action of the Lords  of  the
Flame,  who gave the original germ, and the Lords of Wisdom, who took charge
of material evolution in the Sun Period.

   The Lords of Wisdom,  who were not so highly evolved as the Lords of  the
Flame,  worked to complete their own evolution;  therefore they received the
assistance of an order of exalted Beings who,  like the Lords of the  Flame,
order of exalted Beings who, like the Lords of the Flame, acted of their own
free will.   In esoteric parlance they are called the Cherubim.   These  ex-
alted Beings did not, however, become active in the work until it was neces-
sary  to  awaken  the  germ  of  the  second  spiritual  principle  of   our
man-in-the-making,  as the Lords of Wisdom were quite capable of  doing  the
work connected with the vital body which was to be added to the constitution
of  man in the Sun Period,  but not of awakening the second spiritual  prin-
ciple.

   When  the Lords of the Flame and the Lords of Wisdom had,  in the  Saturn
Revolution  of the Sun Period, conjointly reconstructed the  germinal  dense
body, the Lords of Wisdom, in the second Revolution, started the proper work
of the Sun Period,  by radiating from their own bodies the germ of the vital
body,  making it capable of inter-penetrating the dense body and  giving  to
the germ the capability of furthering growth and propagation and of exciting
the sense centers of the dense body and causing it to move.  In short,  they
gave,  germinally,  to the vital body all the faculties which it is now  un-
folding  to  become  a  perfect  and pliable instrument for  the  use of the
spirit.


[PAGE 212]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   This work occupied the second, third, fourth and fifth Revolutions of the
Sun Period.   In the sixth Revolution the Cherubim entered and awakened  the
germ  of the second aspect of the threefold spirit in man--the life  spirit.
In  the  seventh  and last Revolution the newly awakened germ  of  the  life
spirit was linked to the germinal divine spirit,  and this was still further
worked upon.

   We  remember that in the Saturn Period our consciousness was  similar  to
the  trace condition.   By the activity of the Sun Period this was  modified
until it became like the consciousness of dreamless sleep.

   Evolution in the Sun Period added to the constitution of the evolving em-
bryonic man,  the next highest and the next lowest of his present  vehicles.
As  the result of the Saturn Period he possessed a germinal dense  body  and
divine spirit.   At the end of the Sun Period he possessed a germinal  dense
body,  vital body, divine spirit and life spirit, i.e., a twofold spirit and
a twofold body.

   We also note that,  as the first, or Saturn Revolution,  of any Period is
concerned  with work in the dense body (because that was started in a  first
Revolution),  so the second,  or Sun Revolution,  of any Period is concerned
with  improvements  on the vital body,  because it was started in  a  second
Revolution.  In like manner, the sixth Revolution of any Period is dedicated
to some work on the life spirit,  and any seventh Revolution is particularly
concerned with matters connected with the divine spirit.

   In  the Saturn Period man-in-the-making went through a mineral  stage  of
existence.  That is to say, he had a dense body only in the sense as had the
mineral.  His consciousness was also similar to that of the present mineral.


[PAGE 213]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

   In the same way,  and for analogous reasons,  it may be said that in  the
Sun Period man went through the plant existence.   He had a dense body and a
vital body,  as plants have, and his consciousness, like theirs, was that of
dreamless sleep.   The student will fully grasp this analogy by referring to
diagram  4 in the chapter on the four kingdoms,  where the vehicles of  con-
sciousness  possessed by mineral,  plant, animal and man  are  schematically
shown,  with the particular consciousness resulting from their possession in
each case.

   When the Sun Period was past there came another Cosmic Night of assimila-
tion,  together with the subjective activity necessary before the opening of
the Moon Period.  This was equal in length to the preceding Period of objec-
tive manifestation.

                             THE MOON PERIOD.

   As  the  chief characteristic feature of the dark Saturn Globes  was  de-
scribed by the term "warmth,"  and that of the Sun Period Globes as  "light"
or  glowing heat,  so the chief characteristic feature of the Globes of  the
Moon Period may be best described by the term "moisture."   There was no air
such as we know.  In the center was the hot fiery core.   Next to that,  and
consequent  upon  contact with the cold of outside space,  there  was  dense
moisture.   By  contact with the fiery central core the dense  moisture  was
changed into hot steam, which rushed outward to cool,  and sink again toward
the center.  Therefore the occult scientist calls the Globes of the Moon Pe-
riod "water" and describes the atmosphere of that time as "fire-fog."   That
was the scene of the next forward step of the evolving life.

   The Moon Period work was that of acquiring  the germ of a desire body and


[PAGE 214]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

starting  the germinal activity of the third aspect of the threefold  spirit
in man--the human spirit--the Ego.

   In the middle of the seventh Revolution of the Sun Period,  the Lords  of
Wisdom took charge of the germinal life spirit given by the Cherubim in  the
sixth Revolution of the Sun Period.   They did this for the purpose of link-
ing  it  to the divine spirit.   Their greatest activity in  this  work  was
reached  in the Cosmic Night intervening between the Sun and  Moon  Periods.
In the first dawn of the Moon Period, as the life wave started upon its  new
pilgrimage,  the Lords of Wisdom reappeared,  bearing with them the germinal
vehicles of the evolving man.  In the first or Saturn Revolution of the Moon
Period,  they co-operated with the "Lords of Individuality," who had special
charge of the material evolution of the Moon Period.   Together they  recon-
structed the germ of the dense body, brought over from the Sun Period.  This
germ had unfolded embryonic sense organs,  digestive organs,  glands,  etc.,
and was inter-penetrated of life into the embryonic dense body.   Of course,
it was not solid and visible as it is now, yet in a crude sort of way it was
somewhat organized and is perfectly distinguishable to the trained clairvoy-
ant  sight of the competent investigator who searches the memory  of  nature
for scenes in that far-off past.

   In the Moon Period it was necessary to reconstruct the dense body to make
it capable of being inter-penetrated by a desire body,  and also capable  of
evolving  a nervous system,  muscle, cartilage and a  rudimentary  skeleton.
This  reconstruction was the work of the Saturn Revolution of the  Moon  Pe-
riod.

   In the second, or Sun Revolution, the vital  body  was  also  modified to


[PAGE 215]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

render it capable of being inter-penetrated by a desire body, also of accom-
modating itself to the nervous system, muscle, skeleton, etc.   The Lords of
Wisdom, who were the originators of the vital body, also helped the Lords of
Individuality with this work.

   In the third Revolution the proper Moon work commenced.  The Lords of In-
dividuality radiated from themselves the substance which they helped the un-
conscious,  evolving  man to appropriate and build into  a  germinal  desire
body.   They also helped him to incorporate this germinal desire body in the
compound  vital body and dense body which he already possessed.   This  work
was carried on all through the third and fourth Revolutions of the Moon  Pe-
riod.

   As with the Lords of Wisdom, so with the Lords of Individuality;  through
exalted  far  above man,  they worked on and in him to  complete  their  own
evolution.  While they were capable of dealing with the lower vehicle,  they
were powerless in regard to the higher.   They could not give spiritual  im-
pulse necessary to the awakening of the third aspect of the threefold spirit
in man.   Therefore another class of Beings who were beyond the necessity of
evolving in such an evolution as we are passing through--who also worked  of
their own free will, as did the Lords of the Flame and the Cherubim--came in
during  the  fifth Revolution of the Moon Period,  to help  man.   They  are
called  "Seraphim."   They  awakened the germ of the  third  aspect  of  the
spirit--the human spirit.

   In  the sixth Revolution of the Moon Period the Cherubim  reappeared  and
co-operated with the Lords of Individuality to link the newly acquired  germ
of the human spirit to life spirit.

   In the seventh Revolution of the Moon Period the Lords of the Flame again


[PAGE 216]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

came to the aid of man, helping the Lords of Individuality to link the human
spirit  to  the  divine  spirit.   Thus  the  separate  Ego--the   threefold
spirit--came into existence.

   Before the beginning of the Saturn Period the virgin spirits who are  now
man, were in the World of Virgin Spirits, and were "All-conscious" as God in
who (not from whom),  they were differentiated.   They were not "SELF"  con-
scious  however.   The attainment of that faculty is partly  the  object  of
evolution which plunges the virgin spirits into a sea of matter of gradually
increasing density which eventually shuts it from All-consciousness.

   Thus,  in the Saturn Period the virgin spirits were immersed in the World
of  Divine  Spirit and encased in the tiniest film of that  substance  which
they partially penetrated by the help of the Lords of Flame.

   In the Sun Period the virgin spirit was plunged into the denser World  of
Life Spirit and more effectively blinded to the All-consciousness by a  sec-
ond veil of the substance of the World of Life Spirit.   Still,  by the help
of the Cherubim it partially penetrated this second veil also.   The feeling
of the Oneness of All was not lost either,  for the World of Life Spirit  is
still a universal World common to and inter-penetrating all the planets of a
Solar System.

   In the Moon Period,  however,  the virgin spirits take a further dip into
the still denser matter of the Region of Abstract Thought and here the  most
opaque  of  its  veils,  the  human  spirit,   is  added.    Henceforth  the
All-consciousness of the virgin spirit is lost.   It can no longer penetrate
its  veils,  look OUTWARDS and perceive OTHERS, so it is forced to turn  its
consciousness  INWARDS and there it finds its SELF,  as the  Ego,  separated
apart from all others.

   Thus the virgin spirit is  encased  in  a  threefold  veil,  and  as  its


[PAGE 217]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION

outermost veil,  the human spirit,  effectively blinds it to the oneness  of
Life,  it becomes the Ego by entertaining the illusion of separateness  con-
tracted during involution.   Evolution will gradually dissolve the illusion,
bring  back  the All-consciousness,  and Self-consciousness will  have  been
added.

   Thus  we see that at the close of the Moon Period man possessed a  three-
fold body in varying stages of development; and also the germ of the  three-
fold spirit.   He had dense, vital, and desire bodies, and divine,  life and
human spirit.  All he lacked was the link to connect them.

   It has been stated that man passed through the mineral stage in the  Sat-
urn Period;  through the plant stage in the Sun Period,  and his  pilgrimage
through the conditions of the Moon Period corresponds to the phase of animal
existence, for the same reason that the two other similes are applicable--he
had the dense,  vital,  and desire bodies, as have our present animals,  and
his consciousness was an internal picture-consciousness,  such as the  lower
animals  have today.   This resembles the dream consciousness of  man,  save
that  it is perfectly rational,  being directed by the group-spirit  of  the
animals.   The student is again referred to diagram 4 in the chapter on  the
four kingdoms, where this is shown.

   These  Moons beings were not so purely germinal as in the previous  Peri-
ods.  To the trained clairvoyant they appear suspended by strings in the at-
mosphere of the fire-fog,  as the embryo hangs from the placenta by the  um-
bilical cord.  Currents (common to all of them), which provided some sort of
nourishment  flowed  in and out from the atmosphere,  through  those  cords.
These currents were thus,  to some extent,  similar in their function to the
blood of the present day.  The  name  "blood"  as applied to these currents,


[PAGE 218]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

however, is used merely to suggest an analogy, because the Being of the Moon
Period  possessed nothing like our present red blood,  which is one  of  the
very latest acquisitions of man.

   Towards  the  end of the Moon Period there was a division  of  the  Globe
which  was the field of our and other evolutions,  which,  for the  sake  of
greater implicity, we have not heretofore mentioned, but with which we shall
presently become acquainted.

   Part  of that great Globe was crystallized by man on account of  his  in-
ability  to keep the part which he inhabited in the high state of  vibration
maintained by the other beings there, and as this part became more inert the
centrifugal force of the revolving Globe sent is spinning into space,  where
it began to circle around the glowing fiery central portion.

   The  spiritual  reason for the throwing off of such  crystallizations  is
that the highest beings on such a Globe require for their evolution the  ex-
ceedingly rapid vibrations of fire.  They are hampered by condensation,  al-
though such a condition is necessary to the evolution of other and less  ad-
vanced beings required lower rates of vibration.   Therefore,  when part  of
any Globe has been consolidated by a group of evolving beings to the  detri-
ment of others,  that part is thrown off to exactly the proper distance from
the central mass, so that it circles as a satellite around its primary.  The
heat vibrations which strike it are of the rate and strength suitable to the
peculiar  needs of the beings evolving upon that satellite.   Of course  the
law  of gravitation accounts quite satisfactorily for the phenomenon from  a
PHYSICAL viewpoint.   But there is always a deeper cause, that yields a more
complete explanation and which we will find if  we  consider  the  spiritual


[PAGE 219]                                             THE WORK OF EVOLUTION


side  of things.   As a physical action is but the visible manifestation  of
the  invisible  thought which must precede it, so is the throwing off  of  a
planet  from a central Sun simply the visible and unavoidable effect of  in-
visible spiritual conditions.

   The  smaller  planet which was thrown off in the Moon  Period,  condensed
with comparative rapidity and remained the field of our evolution until  the
end of that Period.  It was a moon to the parent planet,  circling around it
as our Moon circles around the Earth, but it did not show phases as our Moon
does.   It revolved in such a manner that one-half was always light and  the
other always dark,  as is the case with Venus.  One of its poles was pointed
directly towards the large fiery Globe,  as one of the poles of Venus points
directly towards the Sun.

   On this satellite of the Moon Period there were currents which  encircled
it,  as the group-spirit currents encircle the Earth.   The Moon beings fol-
lowed  those currents instinctively from the light to the dark side of  this
old Moon.  At certain times of the year, when they were on the light side, a
sort of propagation took place.  We have the atavistic residue of those moon
travels from propagation in the migrations of the birds of passage which, to
the present day,  follow the group-spirit currents around the Earth at  cer-
tain  seasons of the year,  for identical purposes.   Even the (honey)  moon
trips of human beings show that man himself has not yet outgrown the  migra-
tory impulse in connection with mating.

   The Moon beings at this last stage were also capable of giving  utterance
to  sounds,  or cries.   These were Cosmic sounds--not expressions of  indi-
vidual joy or sorrow,  for as yet there was no individual.   The development
of the individual came later--in the Earth Period.


[PAGE 220]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   At  the end of the Moon Period once more came the interval of  rest,  the
Cosmic  Night.   The divided parts were dissolved and merged in the  general
Chaos which preceded the reorganization of the Globe for the Earth Period.

   The  Lords of Wisdom had now evolved so far,  that they were  capable  of
taking  charge as the highest creative Hierarchy.   They were given  special
charge of the divine spirit in man during the Earth Period.

   The  Lords of Individuality were also sufficiently advanced to work  upon
the spirit in man and the life spirit was therefore put under their charge.

   Another  creative  Hierarchy had special care of the three germs  of  the
dense,  vital,  and desire bodies as they were evolving.  They were the ones
who,  under the direction of the higher orders,  actually did the  principal
work on these bodies, using the evolving life as a kind of instrument.  This
Hierarchy is called the "Lords of Form."  They were now evolved so far  that
they  were given charge of the third aspect of the spirit in man--the  human
spirit--in the coming Earth Period.

   There  were  twelve great Creative Hierarchies  active  in  the  work  of
evolution  at the commencement of the Saturn Period.   Two of these  Hierar-
chies did some work to help at the very beginning.   No information has been
given as to what they did, nor anything about them,  except that they helped
of their own free will,  and then withdrew from limited existence into  lib-
eration.

   Three more of the Creative Hierarchies followed them at the beginning  of
the  Earth Period,  the Lords of the Flame,  the Cherubim and the  Seraphim,
leaving seven Hierarchies in active service when  the  Earth  Period  began.

                                            the germ of the human spirit--

5.   Leo            Lords of Flame          who, in the Saturn Period,
                                            aroused the germ of the divine
                                            spirit and gave the germ of the

                    The following Seven Creative Hierarchies are active in
                    the Earth Period:
6.   Virgo          Lords of Wisdom         who, in the Sun Period, started
                                            the vital body.
7.   Libra Lords of Individuality           who, in the Moon Period,
                                            started the desire body.
8.   Scorpio        Lords of Form           who have special charge of
                                            human evolution in the Earth
                                            Period.
9.   Sagittarius    Lords of Mind           the humanity of the Saturn
                                            Period.
10.  Capricornus    Archangels              the humanity of the Sun Period.
11.  Aquarius       Angels                  the humanity of the Moon
                                            Period.
12.  Pisces         The Virgin Spirits      who are the humanity of the
                                            present Earth Period.

     The Lords of Mind became experts at building bodies of "mind-stuff"  as
we  are becoming experts at building bodies of chemical matter,  and  for  a
similar reason:  The Region of Concrete Thought was the densest condition of
matter  reached  during  the Saturn Period where they  were  human  and  the
Chemical Region is the densest state to be contacted by our humanity.

     In  the Earth Period the Lords of Mind reached the  Creator-stage,  and
radiated  from themselves into our being the nucleus of material from  which
we  are now seeking to build an organized mind.   They are called "Power  of
Darkness"  by  Paul because they came from the dark Saturn Period,  and  are
considered  evil on account of the separative tendency appertaining  to  the
plan  of Reason as contrasted with the unifying forces of the World of  Life
Spirit;  the realm of Love.   The Lords of Mind work with humanity;  but not
with the three lower Kingdoms.

     The  Archangels became experts at building a body of desire-stuff:  the
densest  matter  of the Sun Period.   Therefore they are able to  teach  and
guide  such  less  evolved beings as man and animal how to mold  and  use  a
desire-body.

     The Angels are thoroughly experienced in building a vital body for  the
Moon period when they were human the ether was the densest condition of mat-
ter.   On  account of this ability they are properly the  teachers  of  man,
animal and plant with regard to the vital functions: propagation, nutrition,

                                CHAPTER IX.

                         STRAGGLERS AND NEWCOMERS.

   In  following through the preceding chapter the evolution of  life,  con-
sciousness  and  form--the  triple  phase of  manifestation  of  the  virgin
spirit--which is the LIFE that gathers the FORM about itself and gains  CON-
SCIOUSNESS thereby,  we have spoken as though there were only one class;  as
though the virgin spirits,  without exception, had made constant and uniform
progress.

   This was done for the sake of simplicity,  because stragglers there were,
as there are in any great body or company.

   In school there are, every year, those who fail to reach the standard re-
quired  for promotion into a higher grade.   Similarly,  in every Period  of
Evolution,  there are those who fall behind because they have  not  attained
the standard necessary to pass onward to the next higher stage.

   Even so early as the Saturn Period there were some who failed to  improve
sufficiently to take the next forward step.  At that stage the Higher Beings
were working with the life,  which was itself unconscious,  but that  uncon-
sciousness did not prevent the retardation of some of the virgin spirits who
were not so pliable, nor so readily adaptable as others.

   In that one word "Adaptability,"  we have the great secret of advancement
or  retardation.  All  progress  depends  upon  whether an evolving being is


[PAGE 224]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

flexible,  adaptable and pliable,  so as to be able to accommodate itself to
new conditions,  or whether it is crystallized, set, and incapable of alter-
ation.  Adaptability is the quality which makes for progress, whether an en-
tity is at a high or a low stage of evolution.   Lack of it is the cause  of
the retardation of the spirit and retrogression of the Form. This applies to
the  past,  present and future,  the division of the qualified and  the  un-
qualified, thus, being made with the exact and impersonal justice of the law
of Consequence.  There never was, or ever shall be any arbitrary distinction
made between the "sheep" and the "goats."

   The  hardened  unresponsive condition of some of the Saturn  beings  pre-
vented  the awakening of the divine spirit within them,  therefore they  re-
mained simply mineral, all they had gained being the germinal dense body.

   Thus there were two classes,  or kingdoms, in the Sun Period,  i.e.,  the
stragglers of the Saturn Period, who were still mineral, and the pioneers of
the  Saturn Period,  who were capable of receiving the germ of a vital  body
and becoming plant-like.

   In  addition  to those two kingdoms there was also a  third--a  new  life
wave, which was just commencing its activity at the beginning of the Sun Pe-
riod.  (That is the life wave which now ensouls our animals).

   The matter into which the new life wave entered, together with the strag-
glers of the Saturn Period,  composed the mineral kingdom of the Sun Period.
There  was,  however,  a great difference in those two sub-divisions of  the
second  kingdom.   It is possible for the stragglers to make a  "spurt"  and
overtake the pioneers,  who are now our humanity, but impossible for the new
life wave of the Sun Period to do that.  It will reach a stage corresponding


[PAGE 225]                                          STRAGGLERS AND NEWCOMERS

to the human, but under very different conditions.

   The division of stragglers and pioneers took place in the seventh Revolu-
tion of the Saturn Period,  when the divine spirit was awakened by the Lords
of the Flame.   Then it was found that some of the evolving entities were in
such  an unresponsive,  hardened condition that it was impossible to  arouse
them.   They therefore remained without the spark of spirit upon which their
progress  depended and they were obliged to remain at the same level,  being
unable  to  follow  the others in whom the  spiritual  spark  was  awakened.
truly, truly, all that we are or are not is the result of our own effort, or
our own inaction.

   These stragglers and the newly arrived life wave formed dark spots in the
otherwise glowing gas sphere which was the densest Globe of the Sun  Period,
and our present Sunspots are an atavistic remainder of that condition.

   In the sixth Revolution of the Sun Period the life spirit was awakened by
the  Cherubim,  and again it was found that some who had safely  passed  the
critical point in the Saturn Period, had fallen behind in the Sun Period and
were  unfit  to have the second aspect of the spirit vivified.   Thus  there
were  another class of stragglers,  who had lagged behind the crest wave  of
evolution.

   In  the seventh Revolution of the Sun Period of Lords of the flame  reap-
peared to awaken the divine spirit in those who failed to qualify for it  at
the end of the Saturn Period, but had attained to the point where they could
receive  the spiritual impulse in the Sun Period.   The Lords of  the  flame
also awakened the germ of divine spirit in as many of the new life wave  en-
tities as were ready, but here also there were stragglers.


[PAGE 226]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Thus at the beginning of the Moon Period there were the following
classes:

1-The Pioneers  who  had  successfully passed through the Saturn and the Sun
         Periods.  They  had  dense and vital bodies, divine and life spirit
         germinally active.
2-The Stragglers  of  the  Sun  Period, who had dense and vital bodies, also
         divine spirit--all germinal.
3-The Stragglers  of the Saturn Period, who had been promoted in the seventh
         Revolution  of the Sun Period.  They had the germ of dense body and
         divine spirit.
4-The Pioneers  of the  new Life Wave, who had the same vehicles as class 3,
         but belong to a different scheme of evolution from ours.
5-The Stragglers  of the  new Life Wave, who had only the germ for the dense
         body.
6-The New  Life  Wave,  which entered upon its evolution at the beginning of
         the  Moon  Period  and  is  the life that ensouls our plants of the
         present day.

   It  is necessary to remember that Nature hastens slowly.   She  makes  no
sudden changes in forms.  To her, time is nothing; the attainment of perfec-
tion is everything.  A mineral does not change to a plant at one bound,  but
by gradual, almost imperceptible degrees.  A plant does not become an animal
in a night.  It requires millions of years to bring about the change.   Thus
at all times there are all stages and gradations to be found in nature.  The
Ladder of Being stretches without break from protoplasm to God.

   Therefore we have to deal,  not with six different kingdoms corresponding
to the above six classes which entered the arena of evolution at the  begin-
ning of the Moon Period,  but with three kingdoms only--mineral,  plant  and
animal.

   The  lowest class in the Moon Period composed the new life  stream  which
there commenced its evolution.   It formed the hardest mineral part,  yet it
must be borne in mind that it was by no means as hart as the mineral of  the
present time, but only about as dense as our wood.


[PAGE 227]                                          STRAGGLERS AND NEWCOMERS

   This  statement does not contradict former ones which described the  Moon
as watery, nor does it conflict with diagram 8, showing the densest Globe in
the Moon Period as located in the Etheric Region, which is etheric.   As be-
fore stated, the fact that the past of evolution is spiral prevents any con-
dition ever being duplicated.   There are similarities,  but never reproduc-
tions  of  identical  conditions.   It is not always  possible  to  describe
conditions  in exact terms.   The best available term is used to  convey  an
idea of the conditions existing at the time under consideration.

   Class 5 in our list was nearly mineral,  yet on account of having  passed
through and beyond the mineral condition during the Sun Period,  it had some
plant characteristics.

   Class  4 was almost plant and did evolve to a plant before the  close  of
the Mood Period.  It was, however, more nearly allied to the mineral kingdom
that the next two classes,  which formed the higher kingdom.   We may there-
fore  group  classes 4 and 5 together,  as forming a sort of  half  step,  a
"mineral-plant" kingdom, which composed the surface of the ancient planet of
the Moon Period.   It was something like our present peat,  which is also  a
state between the mineral and the plant.   It was soggy and wet,  consistent
with the statement that the Moon Period was watery.

   Thus  the fourth,  fifth and sixth classes composed the different  grada-
tions  of the mineral kingdom in the Moon Period--the highest  being  nearly
plant and the lowest the hardest mineral substance of that time.

   Classes  2 and 3 formed the plant kingdom,  though they were both  really
more than plants, yet were not quite animal.  They grew in the mineral-plant
soil;  they  were  stationary  like  plants;  yet  they could not have grown


[PAGE 228]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

in a purely mineral soil, as our plants do now.   Good examples of what they
were  life  may be found in our parasitic plants,  which cannot  grow  in  a
purely mineral soil, but seek the food already specialized by the real plant
or tree.

   Class 1 was composed of the pioneers of the life wave of virgin  spirits.
In the Moon Period they were going through a sort of animal-like  existence.
Yet  they were like the animals of our time only in so far as they  had  the
same vehicles and were under the control of a group-spirit,  which  included
the  whole human family.   In appearance they were very different  from  our
present animals,  as shown by the partial description given in the  previous
chapter.   They did not touch the surface of the planet,  but  floated  sus-
pended by umbilical-like cords.   Instead of lungs they had a gill-like  ap-
paratus through which they breathed the hot steamy "fire-fog."   These  fea-
tures of the Moon existence are still recapitulated by the embryo during the
period  of gestation.   At certain stages of development it has  the  gills.
The Moon beings at that time had also the  horizontal spine of the animal.

   During the Moon Period several more divisions of classes occurred than in
the preceding periods,  because they were, of course,  stragglers who failed
to keep abreast of the crestwave of evolution.   As a result there were,  at
the beginning of the Earth Period,  5 classes,  some of them containing sev-
eral divisions,  as diagram l0 will show.   These divisions occurred at  the
following times and for the following reasons:

   In  the  middle  of the fifth Revolution of the  Moon  Period,  when  the
Seraphim  bestowed  the germ of the human spirit upon the pioneers  who  had
fitted themselves to pass on, some were  found  wanting  when weighed in the


[PAGE 229]                                          STRAGGLERS AND NEWCOMERS

balance and therefore unfit to receive the spiritual impulse which  awakened
the threefold spirit.

   In  the sixth Revolution of the Moon Period the Cherubim  reappeared  and
vivified the life spirit of those who had been left behind in the Sun Period
but  had  since reached the necessary stage of development (Class 2  in  our
previous list),  and also in those stragglers of the Sun Period who had  now
evolved  a  vital  body during their plant existence  in  the  Moon  Period.
(These latter were class 3 in the previous list.)

   Class 4 in the previous list had been going through a low stage of  plant
existence; nevertheless the majority of them had evolved the vital body suf-
ficiently to allow of the awakening of the life spirit.

   Thus,  the three last named all possessed the same vehicles at the begin-
ning of the Earth Period, although only the two first named (class 3a and 3b
in diagram l0) belong to our life wave, and have a chance of even yet  over-
taking  us  if  they pass the critical point which will  come  in  the  next
Revolution  of the Earth Period.   Those who cannot pass that point will  be
heal over until some future evolution reaches a stage where they can drop in
and proceed with their development in a new human period.   They will be de-
barred  from going forward with our humanity because it will be advanced  so
far  beyond their status that it would prove a serious clog to our  progress
to drag them along.   They will not be destroyed, but simply held in waiting
for another period of evolution.

   Progression  with  our present wave of evolution is what  is  meant  when
"salvation"  is spoken of in the Christian religion,  and it is something to
be earnestly sought, for though the "eternal damnation" of those who are not
"saved"   does   not   mean   destruction   nor   endless   torture,  it  is

  (Showing the different classes of the several life waves which are  evolv-
ing in the four kingdoms of the earth;  their status AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
EARTH  PERIOD  and  the vehicles they THEN possessed; also their recent sta-
tus.)


[PAGE 231]                                          STRAGGLERS AND NEWCOMERS

nevertheless a very serious matter to be held in a state of inertia for  in-
conceivable milliards of years, before a new evolution shall have progressed
to such a stage that those who fail here can have an opportunity to proceed.
The spirit is not conscious of the lapse of time,  but it is none the less a
serious loss,  and there must also be feeling of unhomelikeness when at last
such spirits find themselves in a new evolution.

   So far as the present humanity is concerned, that possibility is so small
as to be almost negligible.   It is said, however,  that of the total number
of virgin spirits which started evolution in the Saturn Period,  only  about
three-fifths will pass that critical point in the next Revolution and go  on
to the end.

   The greatest apprehension of occult scientists is materialism,  which  if
carried too far,  not only prevents progress but will destroy all the  seven
vehicles of the virgin spirit, leaving it naked.  Such an one will then have
to commence at the very beginning of the new evolution.  All the work it has
done since the dawn of the Saturn Period will have been utterly wasted.  For
this  reason,  the present period is to our humanity,  the most critical  of
all.   Therefore occult scientists speak of the Sixteen Races,  of which the
Germano-Anglo-Saxon is one,  as "the sixteen possibilities for destruction."
May the reader safely pass them all, for their grip is worse than the retar-
dation in the next Revolution.

   Speaking generally,  class 5 in the foregoing list was given the germ  of
the divine spirit during the seventh Revolution, when the Lords of Flame re-
appeared.   Therefore  they were pioneers of the last  life  wave,  entering
evolution at the Moon Period.  They passed their  mineral  existence  there.


[PAGE 232]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

The  stragglers  of  that  life wave were thus  left with only the germ of a
dense body.

   In  addition to the above,  there was also a new life wave  (our  present
mineral  kingdom) entering upon its evolution at the beginning of the  Earth
Period.

   At  the  end of the Moon Period these classes possessed the  vehicles  as
they are classified in diagram 10, and started with them in the beginning of
the Earth Period.   During the time which has elapsed since then,  the human
kingdom  has been evolving the link of mind,  and has thereby attained  full
waking consciousness.  The animals have obtained a desire body, the plants a
vital body; the stragglers of life wave entered evolution in the Moon Period
have  escaped the hard and fast conditions of rock soils;  while  life  wave
that  entered  evolution here in the Earth Period forms the hard  rocks  and
stones.

   Thus have the different classes obtained the vehicles ascribed to them in
diagram 3, to which the reader is referred.


[PAGE 233]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

                                CHAPTER X.

                             THE EARTH PERIOD.

   The Globes of the Earth Period are located in the four densest states  of
matter--the Region of Concrete Thought, the Desire World,  the Etheric,  and
the  Chemical Regions (See Diagram 8).   The densest Globe (Globe D) is  our
present Earth.

   When we speak of "the DENSEST Worlds"  or "the DENSEST states of matter,"
the  term  must be taken in a relative sense.   Otherwise it would  imply  a
limitation in the absolute,  and that is absurd.   Dense and attenuated,  up
and down,  east and west,  are applicable only relatively to our own  status
and position.   As there are higher,  finer Worlds than those touched by our
life wave,  so there are also denser states of matter which are the field of
evolution  for other classes of beings.   Nor must it be thought that  these
denser worlds are elsewhere in space; they are interpenetrated by our worlds
in  a manner similar to that in which the higher Worlds interpenetrate  this
Earth.  The  fancied  solidity  of  the  Earth  and  the forms we see are no
bar to the passage of a denser body any more than out solid sense walls  bar
the passage of a human being clothed in his desire body.   Neither is solid-
ity  synonymous  with density,  as may be illustrated by aluminum,  a  solid
which  is less dense than the fluidic mercury;  nevertheless the latter,  in
spite of its density, will evaporate or exude through many solids.

   This being the fourth Period, we have at  present  four elements.  In the


[PAGE 234]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Saturn Period there was but one element,  Fire--i.e.,  there was warmth,  or
heat,  which is incipient fire.  In the second, or Sun Period, there were to
elements,  Fire and Air.   In the third,  or Moon Period,  there were  three
elements,  Water being added; and in the fourth, or Earth Period,  was added
the  fourth element,  Earth.   Thus it will be seen that a new  element  was
added for each Period.

   In  the  Jupiter Period an element of a spiritual nature will  be  added,
which  will unite with the speech so that words will invariable  carry  with
them  understanding--not misunderstanding,  as is frequently the  case  now.
For instance, when one says "house," he may mean a cottage, while the hearer
may get the idea of a tenement flat building.

   To this environment of the four elements, as specified above, the differ-
ent classes mentioned in diagram 10 were brought over by the Hierarchies  in
charge  of them.   We remember that in the Moon Period these classes  formed
three kingdoms--animal, animal-plant and plant-mineral.  Here on Earth, how-
ever,  the conditions are such that there can be no large half-way  classes.
There  must  be four distinctly different kingdoms.   In  this  crystallized
phase  of existence the lines between them must be more sharply  drawn  than
was the case in former Periods,  where one kingdom gradually merged into the
next.   Therefore  some  of the classes mentioned in  diagram   10  advanced
one-half step, while others went back a half a step.

   Some of the mineral-plants advanced completely into the plant kingdom and
became  the verdure of the fields.   Others went down and became the  purely
mineral soil in which the plants grew.   Of the plant-animals some  advanced
into the animal kingdom, ahead of time,  and  those  species  have  yet  the


[PAGE 235]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

colorless plant-blood and some,  like star-fishes, have even the five points
like the petals of flowers.

   All  of class 2 whose desire bodies could be divided into two  parts  (as
was  the case with all of class 1) were fitted to become human vehicles  and
were therefore advanced into the human group.

   We  must carefully remember that in the above paragraphs we  are  dealing
with Form,  not with the Life which dwells in the Form.   The instrument  is
graded to suit the life that is to dwell in it.  Those of class 2,  in whose
vehicles the above mentioned division could be made were raised to the human
kingdom,  but were given the indwelling spirit at a point in time later than
class 1.   Hence, they are not now so far evolved as class 1, and are there-
fore the lower races of mankind.

   Those  whose desire bodies were incapable of division were put  into  the
same division as classes 3a and 3b.  They are our present anthropoids.  They
may yet overtake our evolution if they reach a sufficient degree of advance-
ment  before the critical point already mentioned,  which will come  in  the
middle  of the fifth Revolution.   If they do not overtake us by that  time,
they will have lost touch with our evolution.

   It  was said that man had built his threefold body by the help of  others
higher than he, but in the previous Period there was no co-ordinating power;
the  threefold spirit,  the Ego,  was separate and apart from its  vehicles.
Now the time had come to unit the spirit and the body.

   Where the desire body separated,  the higher part become somewhat  master
over the lower part and over the dense and vital bodies.   It formed a  sort
of animal-soul with which the spirit could  unit  by  means  of  the link of


[PAGE 236]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

mind.  Where there was no division of the desire body, the vehicle was given
over to desires and passions without any check,  and could therefore not  be
used as a vehicle WITHIN which the spirit could dwell.   So it was put under
the  control of a group-spirit which ruled if from WITHOUT.   It  became  an
animal body,  and that kind was now degenerated into the body of the anthro-
poid.

   Where there was a division of the desire body,  the dense body  gradually
assumed  a vertical position,  thus taking the spine out of  the  horizontal
currents of the Desire World in which the group-spirit acts upon the  animal
through the horizontal spine.  The Ego could then enter, work in and express
itself  through the vertical spine and build the vertical larynx  and  brain
for its adequate expression in the dense body.   A horizontal larynx is also
under  the  domination  of the group-spirit.  While it  is  true  that  some
animals,  as the starling, raven, parrot,  etc.,  previously mentioned,  are
able,  because of the possession of a vertical larynx, to UTTER words,  they
cannot use them understandingly.  THE USE OF WORDS TO EXPRESS THOUGHT IS THE
HIGHEST  HUMAN PRIVILEGE and can be exercised only by a reasoning,  thinking
entity like man.   If the student will keep this in mind,  it will be easier
to follow the different steps which lead up to this result.

                THE SATURN REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH PERIOD.

   This is the Revolution during which,  in each Period.  the dense body  is
reconstructed.   This time it was given the ability to form a brain and  be-
come a vehicle for the germ of mind which was to be added later.  This addi-
tion  constituted the final reconstruction of the dense body,  rendering  it
capable of attaining the highest degree of efficiency possible to such a ve-
hicle.

   Unspeakable Wisdom has  been  employed  in  its  construction.  It  is  a


[PAGE 237]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

marvel.  It can never be sufficiently impressed upon the mind of the student
what  immeasurable facilities for the gaining of knowledge are contained  in
this  instrument,  and what a great boon it is to man;  how much  he  should
prize it and how thankful he should be to have it.

   Some examples of the perfection of construction intelligent  adaptability
displayed  in this instrument have previously been given,  but in  order  to
further impress this great truth upon the mind of the student,  it might not
be out of place to illustrate more fully this Wisdom,  also the work of  the
Ego in the blood.

   It  is generally know,  in a vague kind of way,  that the gastric  juices
acts upon the food to promote assimilation; but only a very few people, out-
side of the medical profession, are aware that there are many different gas-
tric  juices,  each appropriate to the treatment of a certain kind of  food.
The researches of Pavloff,  however, have established the fact beyond doubt,
that there is one kind of juice for the digestion of meat, another for milk,
another for acid fruit,  etc.  That fact, by the way,  is the reason why all
foods do not mix well.  Milk, for instance, requires a gastric juice that is
widely different from almost any other kind except that required for the di-
gestion  of starchy foods,  and is not readily digested with any food  other
than cereals.   This alone would show marvelous wisdom; that the Ego working
subconsciously is able to select the different juices which are  appropriate
to the different kinds of food taken into the stomach,  making each of  just
the right strength and quantity to digest the food.   What makes the  matter
still more wonderful,  however, is the fact that the gastric juice is poured
into the stomach in ADVANCE of the food.


[PAGE 238]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   We do not consciously direct the process of mixing this fluid.  The great
majority of people know nothing of metabolism or any other phrase of chemis-
try.  So it is not enough to say that, as we taste what is coming, we direct
the process by means of signals through the nervous system.

   When  this fact of the selection of juices was first  proven,  scientists
were sorely puzzled trying to learn how the right kind of juice was selected
and  caused to enter the stomach BEFORE the food.   They thought the  signal
was  given along the nervous system.  But it was demonstrated  beyond  doubt
that the proper juice was poured into to the stomach even though the nervous
system was blocked.

   At last Starling and Bayliss, in a series of experiments of brilliant in-
genuity,  proved  that infinitesimal parts of the food are taken up  by  the
blood as soon as the good enters the mouth,  go in advance to the  digestive
glands and cause a flow of the proper juice.

   This again,  is only the physical side of the phenomena.   To  understand
the whole wonderful connection, we must turn to occult science.   That alone
explains why the signal is carried by the blood.

   The blood is one of the highest expressions of the vital body.   The  Ego
guides  and controls its dense instrument by means of the  blood,  therefore
the blood is also the means used to act on the nervous system.   During some
of the time that digestion is going on,  it acts partially through the  ner-
vous system,  but (especially at the commencement of the digestive  process)
it acts directly upon the stomach.  When, during scientific experiments, the
nerves were blocked, the direct way through the blood was still open and the
Ego derived the necessary information in that way.

   It  will  also  be  seen  that  the  blood  is driven to wherever the Ego


[PAGE 239]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

unfolds the greatest activity at any time.   If a situation requires  sudden
though  and action,  the blood is promptly driven to the head.   If a  heavy
meal  is  to be digested the greater portion of the blood leaves  the  head,
centering around the digestive organs.  The Ego concentrate s its efforts on
ridding the body of the useless food.  Therefore a man cannot think well af-
ter  a heavy meal.   He is sleepy because so much blood has left  the  brain
that the residue is insufficient to carry on the functions necessary to full
waking consciousness,  besides,  nearly all the vital fluid or solar  energy
specialized by the spleen is absorbed by the blood rushing through that  or-
gan after a meal in greater volume than between meals.  Thus the rest of the
system is also deprived of the vital fluid in a large measure during  diges-
tion.   It  is the Ego that drives the blood into the brain.   Whenever  the
body goes to sleep, the table will invariably tip towards the feet,  raising
the head.  During coition the blood is centered in the sex organs, etc.  All
these examples tend to prove that during the waking hours,  the Ego works in
and  controls the dense body by means of the blood.   The larger portion  of
the total amount goes to that part of the body where at any given time,  the
Ego unfolds any particular activity.

   The  reconstruction  of the dense body in the Saturn  Revolution  of  the
Earth   Period   was   for  the  purpose  of   rendering   it   capable   of
inter-penetration by the mind.  It gave the first impulse to the building of
the  frontal part of the brain;  also the incipient division in the  nervous
system  which has since become apparent in its  subdivisions--the  voluntary
and the sympathetic.   The latter was the only one provided for in the  Moon
Period.  The voluntary nervous system  (which has transformed the dense body


[PAGE 240]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

from a mere automation acting under stimuli from without,  to an  extraordi-
nary  adaptable instrument capable of being guided and controlled by an  Ego
from within) was not added until the present Earth Period.

   The  principal  art of the reconstructive work was done by the  Lords  of
Form.  They are the Creative Hierarchy which is most active in the Earth Pe-
riod,  as were the Lords of Flame in the Saturn Period,  the Lords of Wisdom
in the Sun Period, and the Lords of Individuality in the Moon Period.

   The Earth Period is pre-eminently the Period of Form,  for there the form
or matter side of evolution reaches its greatest and most pronounced  state.
Here  spirit is more helpless and suppressed and Form is the  most  dominant
factor--hence the prominence of the Lords of Form.

                  THE SUN REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH PERIOD.

   During  this Revolution the vital body was reconstructed  to  accommodate
the germinal mind.  The vital body was fashioned more in the likeness of the
dense  body,  so that it could become fitted for use as the densest  vehicle
during the Jupiter Period,  when the dense body will have become  spiritual-
ized.

   The Angels,  the humanity of the Moon Period,  were aided by the Lords of
Form in reconstruction.   The organization of the vital body is now next  in
efficiency to the dense body.   Some writers on this subject call the formed
a link,  and contend that it is simply a mold of the dense body,  and not  a
separate vehicle.

   While  not desiring to criticise,  and admitting that this contention  is
justified  by the fact that man,  at his present stage of evolution,  cannot
ORDINARILY use the vital body  as  a  separate  vehicle--because  it  always


[PAGE 241]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

remains  with the dense body and to extract it IN TOTO would cause death  of
the dense body--yet there was a time when it was not so firmly  incorporated
with the latter, as we shall presently see.

   During  those epochs of our Earth's history which have already been  men-
tioned as the Lemurian and the Atlantean, man was involuntarily clairvoyant,
and it was precisely this looseness of connection between the dense and  the
vital bodies that made him so.  (The Initiators of that time helped the can-
didate to loosen the connection still further, as in the voluntary clairvoy-
ant.

   Since then the vital body has become much more firmly interwoven with the
dense body in the majority of people, but in all sensitives it is loose.  It
is  that looseness which constitutes the difference between the psychic  and
the  ordinary person who is unconscious of all but the vibrations  contacted
by means of the five senses.  All human beings have to pass through this pe-
riod  of  close  connection of the vehicles and  experience  the  consequent
limitation  of  consciousness.    There  are,  therefore,   two  classes  of
sensitives, those who have not become firmly enmeshed in matter, such as the
majority of the Hindus,  the Indians, etc.,  who possess a certain low grade
of clairvoyance, or are sensitive to the sounds of nature, and those who are
i the vanguard of evolution.   The latter are merging from the acme of mate-
riality,  and are again divisible into two kind,  one of which develops in a
passive, weak-willed manner.  By the help of others they re-awaken the solar
plexus  or other organs in connection with the involuntary  nervous  system.
These are therefore involuntary clairvoyants, mediums who have no control of
their faculty.   They have retrograded.   The other kind is made up of those



[PAGE 242]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

who by their own wills  unfold  the  vibratory powers of the organs now con-
nected with the voluntary nervous system and thus become trained occultists,
controlling  their own bodies and exercising the clairvoyant faculty as they
will to do.   They are called voluntary or trained clairvoyants.

   In the Jupiter Period man will function in his vital body as he now  does
in his dense body; and as no development in nature is sudden, the process of
separating the two bodies has already commenced.   The vital body will  then
attain a much higher degree of efficiency than the dense body of today.   As
it is a much more pliable vehicle, the spirit will then be able to use it in
a manner impossible of realization in the case of the present dense vehicle.

                 THE MOON REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH PERIOD.

   Here the Moon Period was recapitulated, and much the same conditions pre-
vailed (on an advanced scale) as obtained on Globe D of that Period.   There
was the same kind of fire-fog atmosphere; the same fiery core the same divi-
sion of the Globe into two parts,  in order to allow the more highly evolved
beings a chance to progress at the proper rate and pace,  which it would  be
impossible for beings such as our humanity to equal.

   In  that Revolution the Archangels (humanity of the Sun Period)  and  the
Lords of Form took charge of the reconstruction of the desire body, but they
were  not  alone in that work.   When the separation of the Globe  into  two
parts occurred, there was a similar division in the desire bodies of some of
the  evolving beings.   We have already noted that where this division  took
place, the form as ready to become the vehicle of an INdwelling spirit,  and
in  order to further this purpose the Lords of Mind (humanity of the  Saturn
Period) took possession of the higher part of the desire  body and implanted


[PAGE 243]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

in it the separate selfhood, without which the present man with all his glo-
rious possibilities, could never have existed.

   Thus in the latter part if the Moon Revolution the first germ of separate
personality was implanted in the higher part of the desire body by the Lords
of Mind.

   The  Archangels were active in the lower part of the desire body,  giving
it the purely animal desires.   They also worked in the desire bodies  where
there  was no division.   Some of these were to become the vehicles  of  the
animal  group-spirits,  which work on them from without,  but do  not  enter
wholly into the animal forms,  as the individual spirit does into the  human
body.

   The desire body was reconstructed to render it capable of being interpen-
etrated  by the germinal mind which,  during the Earth Period,  will be  im-
planted  in  all those desire bodies in which it was possible  to  make  the
before-mentioned division.

   As  has  been previously explained,  the desire body  is  an  unorganized
ovoid, holding the dense body as a dark spot within its center, as the white
of  an egg surrounds the yolk.   There are a number of sense centers in  the
ovoid,  which have appeared since the beginning of the Earth Period.  In the
average  human being these centers appear merely as eddies in a current  and
are not now awake,  hence his desire body is of no use to him as a  SEPARATE
vehicle of consciousness;  but when the sense centers are awakened they look
like whirling vortices.

                     REST PERIODS BETWEEN REVOLUTIONS.

   Hitherto  we have noted only the Cosmic Nights between Periods.   We  saw
that  there was an interval of rest and assimilation between the Saturn  and
the sun Periods; another Cosmic Night between the  Sun and the Moon Periods,


[PAGE 244]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

etc.   But in addition to these,  there are also rests between  the  Revolu-
tions.

   We might liken the Periods to the different incarnations of man; the Cos-
mic Nights between them to the intervals between deaths and new births;  and
the  rest between Revolutions would then analogous to the rest of sleep  be-
tween two days.

   When  a Cosmic Night sets in,  all manifested things are resolved into  a
homogenous mass--the Cosmos again becomes Chaos.

   This periodical return of matter to primordial substance is what makes it
possible for the spirit to evolve.  Were the crystallizing process of active
manifestation to continue indefinitely would offer an insurmountable barrier
to the progress of Spirit.  Every time matter has crystallized to such a de-
gree  that it becomes too hard for the spirit to work in,  the latter  with-
draws  to  recuperate  its exhausted energy, on the same  principle  that  a
power-drill  which has stopped when boring in hard metals,  is withdrawn  to
regain  its  momentum.   It is then able to bore its way  further  into  the
metal.

   Freed from the crystallizing every of the evolving spirits,  the chemical
forces in matter turn Cosmos to Chaos by restoring matter to its  primordial
state, that a new start may be made by the regenerated virgin spirits at the
dawn of a new Day of Manifestation.  The experience gained in formed Periods
and  Revolutions enables the Spirit to build up to the point  last  reached,
with  comparative celerity,  also to facilitate further progress  by  making
such alterations as its cumulative experience dictates.

   Thus  at  the  end of the Moon Revolution of the Earth  Period,  all  the
Globes  and  all  life  returned  to  Chaos,  re-emerging  therefrom  at the


[PAGE 245]                                                  THE EARTH PERIOD

beginning of the fourth Revolution.

                THE FOURTH REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH PERIOD.

   In the exceeding complexity of the scheme of evolution,  there are always
spirals within spirals, AD INFINITUM.  So it will not be surprising to learn
that  in every Revolution the work of recapitulation and rest is applied  to
the  different  Globes.   When the life wave reappeared on Globe A  in  this
Revolution,  it went though the development of the Saturn Period; then after
a rest which, however did not involve the complete destruction of the Globe;
but only an alteration,  it appeared on Globe B,  where the work of the  Sun
Period  was recapitulated.   Then after a rest,  the life wave passed on  to
Globe C,  and the work of the Moon Period was repeated.   Finally,  the life
wave  arrived on Globe D,  which is our Earth,  and not until then  did  the
proper work of the Earth Period begin.

   Even then,  the spiral within the spiral precluded its beginning  immedi-
ately on the arrival of the life wave from Globe C,  for the bestowal of the
germ of mind did not actually take place until the fourth Epoch,  the  first
three Epochs being still further recapitulations of the Saturn, Sun and Moon
Periods, but always on a higher scale.

                                CHAPTER XI.

               THE GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

                                  CHAOS.

   In  the previous pages nothing has been said about our Solar System,  and
of  different planets which compose it,  because it was not until the  Earth
Period was reached that the present differentiation was made.  The Earth Pe-
riod is the acme of diversification,  and although we have been speaking  of
only one class of virgin spirits--those who,  in the strictest and most lim-
ited  sense,  are concerned with the Earth evolution--there are  in  reality
seven "Rays" or streams of life, all pursuing different evolutions,  yet all
belonging to the original class of virgin spirits to which our humanity  be-
longs.

   In the previous Periods all of these different sub-classes or Rays  found
a suitable environment for their evolution on the same planet.  But,  in the
Earth Period, conditions became such that in order to provide for each class
the  degree of heat and the vibration necessary for its particular phase  of
evolution,  they were segregated on different planets,  at varying distances
from the Sun--the central source of life.  This is the RAISON D'ETRE of  our
System and all other Solar Systems in the Universe.

   Before  proceeding with the description of evolution of our  humanity  on
the Earth after its separation from the central Sun, it is necessary for the
maintenance of sequential order in the description to explain the  differen-
tiation which scattered the planets of our System in space.


[PAGE 247]                             GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM

   Active  manifestation--particularly in the Physical  World--depends  upon
separateness;  upon the limitation of life by form.   But during the interim
between Periods and Revolutions the marked distinction between form and life
ceases.   This applies not only to man and the lower kingdoms,  but  to  the
Worlds  and Globes which are the basis of form for the evolving life.   Only
the  seed-atoms  and the nuclei or centers of the  World-Globes  remain--all
else is one homogenous substance.   There is but one Spirit pervading space.
Life and Form, its positive and negative poles, are one.

   This state of things was what Greek mythology described as "Chaos."   The
ancient Norsemen and the Teutonic mythology call it "Ginnungagap," which was
bounded upon the northern side by the cold and foggy "Niflheim"--the land of
mist and fog--and upon the south side by the fire "Muspelheim."   When  heat
and cold entered into space which was occupied by Chaos or Ginnungagap, they
caused the crystallization of the visible universe.

   The Bible also gives on the idea of infinite space preceding the activity
of the Spirit.

   In  our present materialistic period we have unfortunately lost the  idea
of all that lies behind that word Space.   We are so accustomed to  speaking
of "empty" space, that we have entirely lost the grand and holy significance
of the word,  and are thus incapable of feeling the reverence that this idea
of Space and Chaos should inspire in our breasts.

   To the Rosicrucians,  as to any occult school,  there is no such thing as
empty or void space.  To them SPACE IS SPIRIT in its attenuated form;  while
MATTER  IS CRYSTALLIZED SPACE OR SPIRIT.   Spirit is manifestation is  dual,
that   which   we   see   as  Form  is   the   negative   manifestation   of
Spirit--crystallized  and  inert.  The  positive pole of Spirit manifests as


[PAGE 248]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Life,  galvanizing  the negative Form into action,  but both Life  and  Form
originated in Spirit, Space, Chaos!

   To get an idea from everyday life which will illustrate,  we may take the
hatching  of  an egg.   The egg is filled with a moderately  viscous  fluid.
This fluid, or moisture, is subjected to heat, and out of the soft,  fluidic
substance  comes  a living chick,  with hard bones  and  comparatively  hard
flesh, and with down that has a comparatively hard quill, etc.

   When a living chick can come out of the inert fluid of an egg without the
addition of any hardening substance from outside,  is it a far-fetched  idea
to  claim that the universe is crystallized Space or Spirit?   There is  not
doubt that the claim will seem foolish to many; but this book is not for the
purpose of convincing the world at large that these things ARE.   It is  in-
tended  to  aid those who inherently feel that these things must be  and  to
help them to see the light upon this great World-mystery,  which the  writer
has been permitted to behold.  The special object at present is to show that
Spirit is active all the time--in one way during Manifestation,  and in  an-
other during Chaos.

   Modern science would sneer at the idea that life could exist upon A Globe
which is in the process of formation.   That is because science cannot  dis-
sociate  Life  and  Form and cannot conceive of Form  except  as  solid  and
tangible--cognizable by one of our five physical senses.

   The  occult scientist,  in accordance with the above definitions of  Life
and Form, holds that life may exist independently of Concrete Form; may have
Forms  not  perceptible  to  our  present  limited  senses,  and amenable to


[PAGE 249]                             GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM

to none of the laws which apply to this present concrete state  of matter.

   It is true that the Nebular Theory holds that all existence (which is  to
say all Form, the Worlds in Space and whatever Forms there may be upon them)
has come from the fiery nebular;  but it does not recognize further fact in-
sisted upon by occult science--that the fiery nebula is Spirit.  It does not
admit that the whole atmosphere around us, the space between the worlds,  is
Spirit and that there is a constant interchange going on all the  time--Form
dissolving into Space, and Space crystallizing into Form.

   Chaos  is not a state which has existed in the past and has now  entirely
disappeared.   It is all around us at the present moment.   Were it not that
old  forms--having outlived their usefulness--are constantly being  resolved
back into that Chaos, which is also as constantly giving birth to new forms,
there could be no progress; the work of evolution would cease and stagnation
would prevent the possibility of advancement.

   It  is  axiomatic that "The oftener we die,  the better  we  live."   The
Poet-Initiate, Geothe says:

   Who has not this--
   Ever dying and bringing to birth--
   Will aye remain a sorry guest
   Upon this dismal earth.

and Paul says "I die daily."

   Therefore, as students of occult science, it is necessary to realize that
even  during  active manifestation,  IT IS CHAOS THAT IS THE  BASIS  OF  ALL
PROGRESS.  Our life during Chaos is based upon our life in active manifesta-
tion,  and  vice versa,  i.e.,  what we are able to  achieve  during  active
manifestation, and the ability to progress at all,  is  the  result  of  the


[PAGE 250]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

existence in Chaos.  The interim between Periods and Revolutions is in real-
ity  much more important to the growth of the soul that concrete  existence,
though  the latter is the basis of the former and therefore cannot  be  dis-
pensed with.   The importance of the Chaotic interim lives in the fact  that
during  that  period  the evolving entities of all classes  are  so  closely
united that they are really one;  consequently those which are of lower  de-
velopment  during manifestation are in closest contact with the more  highly
evolved,  thus experiencing and benefiting by a much higher  vibration  that
their own.  This enables them to live over and assimilate their past experi-
ences in a manner impossible when hampered by Form.

   We  have seen the benefit to the spirit in man from the  interim  between
death and a new birth.   There the form still exists,  though much more  at-
tenuated that the dense body;  but in the Cosmic Night and intervals of rest
between  Periods and Revolutions,  when there is perfect freedom from  form,
the beneficial results of past experiences can be much more effectively  as-
similated.

   We  have  a word which was originally coined to convey the  idea  of  the
state of things between manifestations.  This word,  however,  has been used
in  a  material  sense to such an extend that it has lost  its  primal  sig-
nificance.  That word is Gas.

   It may be thought that this is a very old word,  which has nearly  always
existed as a synonym for a state of matter lighter than liquids, but such is
not the case.   The word was first used in "Physica,"  a work which appeared
in 1633, the author of it being Helmont, a Rosicrucian.

   Helmont, did not call himself a Rosicrucian; no true Brother does so pub-
licly.  Only the Rosicrucian knows the brother  Rosicrucian.  Not  even  the


[PAGE 251]                             GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM

most intimate friends or relatives know of man's connection with the  order.
Those  only  who are Initiates themselves know the writers of the  past  who
were Rosicrucians,  because ever through their works shine the  unmistakable
words,  phrases and signs indicative of the deep meaning that remains hidden
from the non-Initiate.   The Rosicrucian Fellowship is composed of  students
of  the teachings of the Order.  which are now given publicly,  because  the
world's  intelligence is growing the the necessary point  of  comprehension.
This work is one of the first few fragments of the Rosicrucian knowledge be-
ing publicly given out.  All that has been printed as such,  previous to the
last few years, has been the work of either charlatans or traitors.

   Rosicrucians such as Paracelsus, Comenius, Bacon, Helmont and others gave
hints in their works and influenced others.   The great controversy concern-
ing  the  authorship of Shakespeare (which has to no avail blunted  so  many
goose-quills and wasted so much good ink that might have served useful ends)
would never have arisen had it been known that the similarity in Shakespeare
and Bacon is due to the fact that both were influenced by the same Initiate,
who also influenced Jacob Boehme and a pastor of Ingolstadt, Jacobus Baldus,
who lived subsequent to the death of the Bard of Avon, and wrote Latin lyric
verse.   If  the first poem of Jacob Baldus is read with a certain  key,  it
will be found that by reading down and up the lines,  the following sentence
will  appear:   "Hitherto I have spoken from across the sea by means of  the
drama; now I will express myself in lyrics."

   In  his "Physica,"  Helmont,  the Rosicrucian wrote:   "Ad  huc  spiritum
incognitum Gas voco," i.e., "This hitherto unknown Spirit I call Gas."  Fur-
ther on in the same work he says. "This vapor which I have called Gas is not


[PAGE 252]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

far removed from the Chaos the ancients spoke of."

   We must learn to think of Chaos as the Spirit of God,  which pervades ev-
ery part of infinity; it will then be seen in its true light,  as the occult
maxim puts it:   "Chaos is the seed-ground of the Cosmos,"  and we shall  no
longer wonder how "something can come out of nothing,"  because Space is not
synonymous with "nothing."  It holds within itself the germs of all that ex-
ists during a physical manifestation, yet not quite all;  for by the wedding
of  Chaos with Cosmos there is something new brought forth each time,  which
did not exist before; something that was not foreshown and latent.  The name
of that something is Genius--the cause of Epigenesis.

   It appears in all kingdoms.   It is the expression of progressive  spirit
in man,  animal and plant.  Chaos is therefore a holy name; a name that sig-
nifies the Cause of all we see in Nature and inspires a feeling of  devotion
in every tried,  true and trained occultist.   He regards the visible  sense
world as a revelation of the hidden potentialities of the Chaos.

                         THE BIRTH OF THE PLANETS.

   To express himself in the dense physical world,  it was necessary for man
to evolve a suitable dense body.   In a world like this he must have a  body
with limbs, organs, a muscular system by means of which to move about;  also
a brain to direct and co-ordinate his movements.  If the conditions had been
different the body would have been modified accordingly.

   It is necessary for all beings, high or low in the scale of existence, to
possess  vehicles for expression in any particular world in which  they  may
wish to manifest.  Even the Seven Spirits before  The  Throne  must  possess

these  necessary vehicles,  which of course are differently conditioned  for
each of Them.   Collectively,  They are God, and make up the Triune Godhead,
and He manifests in a different way through each of Them.

   There is no contradiction in ascribing different numbers to God.   We  do
not sin against the "oneness"  of light because we distinguish three primary
colors  into which it divides itself.   The white light of the Sun  contains
the  seven colors of the spectrum.  The occultists sees even twelve  colors,
there being five between red and violet--going one way around the circle--in
addition to the red,  orange, yellow, green, etc.,  of the visible spectrum.
Four of these colors are quite indescribable,  but the fifth--the middle one
of the five--is similar to the tint of a new blown peach blossom.   It is in
fact the color of the vital body.   Trained clairvoyants who describe it  as
"bluish-grey,"  or "reddish-grey," etc., are trying to describe a color that
has no equivalent in the physical world; and they are therefore compelled to
use the nearest descriptive terms afforded by our language.

   Perhaps Color will enable us to realize the oneness of God with the Seven
Spirits before The Throne better than anything else.  WE will therefore turn
to diagram 11.

   We see here a white triable looming up from a dark background.   White is
synthetic,  containing all colors within itself, as God contains within Him-
self all things in the Solar System.

   Within  the  white triangle are a blue, a red and a yellow  circle.   All
other  colors are simply combinations of these three primary colors.   These
circles correspond to the three aspects of God, which are without beginning,
and end IN GOD; though externalized only during active manifestation.

   When these three colors are interblended, as shown in the diagram,  there
appear four additional colors,  the three secondary colors--each due to  the
blending  of two primary colors--and one color (indigo) which  contains  the
entire  gamut  of colors,  making in all the seven colors of  the  spectrum.
These colors represent the Seven Spirits before the Throne.   The colors are
different, as are also the Seven Spirits, each having a different mission in
the Kingdom of God--our Solar System.

   The  seven  planets circling around the Sun are the dense bodies  of  the
Seven Planetary Genii.  Their names are:  Uranus with one satellite,  Saturn
with eight moons,  Jupiter with four moons,  Mars with two moons,  the Earth
and its moon, Venus and Mercury.*

   Bodies are always found to suit the purpose they are made to serve, hence
the dense bodies of the Seven Planetary Spirits are spherical, that form be-
ing  best  adapted to the enormous velocity with which they  travel  through
space.   The Earth, for instance, travels about 66,000 miles per hour in its
orbit.

   Man's  body had a different shape in the past from that of  the  present,
and  from that which it will have in the future.   During involution it  was
approximately spherical, as it still is during ante-natal life,  because the
intra-uterine development is recapitulation of past stages of evolution.  At
that  stage  the organism developed the sphere,  because  during  involution
man's energies were directed inward,  upon the building of its own vehicles,
as the embryo develops within the sphere of the uterus.

   Man's dense and vital bodies have straightened ,  but his higher vehicles
still retain their ovoid form.  In the dense  body,  the  co-ordinating  and

lites to Uranus, 9 to Saturn, and 11 to Jupiter.

governing brain is situated at one extremity.   This is the most unfavorable
position  for  such an organ.   Too long time is required  for  impulses  to
travel from one extremity to the other--from the brain to the feet,  or  for
impacts on the feet to reach the brain.   In cases of burns,  for  instance,
science  has demonstrated that valuable time is lost,  the skin being  blis-
tered  before a message can be carried from the injured place to  the  brain
and back again.

   This inefficiency would be greatly lessened if the brain were in the cen-
ter of the body.  Sensations and the responses thereto could be more quickly
received and transmitted.  In the spherical planets the Planetary Spirit di-
rects FROM THE CENTER the movements of its vehicle.  In future man will bend
over,  as shown in diagram 12.  He will become a sphere, directing his ener-
gies outward because a spherical form affords the greatest facility for  mo-
tion in all directions, and indeed, for combination of simultaneous motions.

   The  Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception teaches that there is a further  evolu-
tion in store for planets.

   When  the beings upon a planet have evolved to a sufficient  degree,  the
planet becomes a Sun--the fixed center of a Solar System.   When the  beings
upon  it  have evolved to a still greater degree,  and consequently  it  has
reached its maximum brilliancy,  it breaks up into Zodiac,  becoming,  so to
speak, the womb for a new Solar System.

   Thus  the  great hosts of Divine Beings who,  until then,  were  confined
within that Sun, gain freedom of action upon a great number of stars, whence
they  can  affect in different ways the system which grows up  within  their
sphere of influence.  The planets, of man-bearing worlds,  within the Zodiac
are   constantly   being  worked  upon  by  these  forces,  but  in  various

ways, according to the stage they have reached in evolution.

   Our Sun could not become a Sun until it had sent out from itself all  the
beings  who were not sufficiently evolved to endure the high rate of  vibra-
tion  and  the great luminousity of the beings who were qualified  for  that
evolution.   All the beings upon the different planets would have been  con-
sumed had they remained in the Sun.

   This visible Sun, however, though it is the place of evolution for Beings
vastly above man,  is not by many means the Father of the other planets,  as
material science supposes.   On the contrary, it is itself an emanation from
the Central Sun,  which is the invisible source of all that is in our  Solar
System.   Our visible Sun is but the mirror in which are reflected the  rays
of energy from the Spiritual Sun.   The real Sun is as invisible as the real
Man.

   Uranus  was  the first planet to be thrown off from the nebula  when  its
differentiation began in Chaos, at the dawn of the Earth Period.   There was
no light but the dim light of the Zodiac.  The life that left with Uranus is
of a rather backward strain and is said to evolve very, very slowly.

   Saturn was next differentiated.   It is the field of action for the  life
which is at the stage of evolution corresponding to the Saturn Period.  This
planet  was differentiated before the ignition of the nebula and  (like  all
nebula  when  passing through their Saturn Period of evolution)  was  not  a
source of light, but a reflector.

   Jupiter was differentiated shortly afterwards, when the nebula had become
ignited.   The heat of Jupiter is not so great as that of the Sun,  Venus or
Mercury, but on account of its immense bulk, it is capable of  retaining its


[PAGE 259]                             GENESIS AND EVOLUTION OF SOLAR SYSTEM

heat  and thus remains a suitable field of evolution for very  advanced  be-
ings.  It corresponds to the stage which will be reached by the Earth itself
in the Jupiter Period.

   Mars is a mystery,  and only a limited amount of information may be given
out.   We may say,  however, that the life on Mars is of a very backward na-
ture and that the so-called "canals"  are not excavations in the surface  of
the planet.   They are currents such as, during the Atlantean Epoch,  spread
over our planet,  and the remains of which can still be observed in the  Au-
rora  Borealis and the Aurora Australis.  The shifting of the  Martian  "ca-
nals"  noted by astronomers, is thus accounted for.  If they were really ca-
nals,  they could not possibly shift, but currents emanating from the  Poles
of Mars may do so.

   The Earth,  including the Moon, was next set out from the Sun,  and later
Venus and Mercury.  These and Mars will be referred to later,  in connection
with the evolution of man on the earth,  and need not be further  considered
at this time.

   When  a planet has Moons it indicates that there are some beings  in  the
life  wave  evolving  on that planet who are too backward to  share  in  the
evolution of the main life wave,  and they have therefore been set out  from
the  planet  to prevent them from hindering the progress  of  the  pioneers.
Such is the case with the beings inhabiting our Moon.   In the case of Jupi-
ter  it is thought probable that the inhabitants of three of its moons  will
eventually  be  able  to rejoin the life on the parent  planet,  but  it  is
thought  that at least one of the others is an eighth sphere,  like our  own
Moon, where retrogression and disintegration of the already acquired vehicle
will result from too close adherence to material existence  upon the part of


[PAGE 260]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the evolving beings who have brought themselves to that deplorable end.

   Neptune  and its satellites do not properly belong to our  Solar  System.
The other planets--or rather their Spirits-- exercise an influence over  the
whole of humanity, but the influence of Neptune is largely restricted to one
particular class the astrologers.   The writer,  for instance,  has  several
times felt its compelling influence in a marked way.

   When  laggards  inhabiting a Moon have retrieved their position  and  re-
turned  to the parent planet;  or,  when continued retrogression has  caused
complete disintegration of their vehicles, the abandoned Moon also commences
to  dissolve.   The momentum of a spiritual impulse which propelled it in  a
fixed orbit for aeons, may endure for aeons after the Moon has been vacated,
and  from the physical point of view it may still seem to be a satellite  of
the planet in encircles.  As the time goes on, however, and the power of at-
traction exercised by the parent planet diminishes, its orbit widens,  until
it  reaches  the  limit  of our solar system.   It  is  then  expelled  into
interstellar space;  dissolved in Chaos.  The expulsion of these cinder-like
dead worlds is analogous to the manner in which hard and foreign bodies  im-
bedded  in  the human system make their way through the flesh to  the  skin.
The Asteroids illustrate this point.  They are fragments of Moons which once
encircled Venus and Mercury.   The beings once confined upon them are  known
in esotericism as "The Lords from Venus" and "The lords from Mercury;"  they
retrieved  their lost estate in a large measure by service to our  humanity,
as will be later described, and are now sage on their present planet,  while
the Moons they inhabited have partly disintegrated, and are already far out-
side the earth's orbit.  There are other "seeming" moons in our system,  but
the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception does not notice them,  as they are  outside
the pale of evolution.

                               CHAPTER XII.

                          EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH.

                            THE POLARIAN EPOCH.

   While  the material which now forms the Earth was yet a part of the  Sun,
it  was,  of  course in a fiery condition;  but as the fire  does  not  burn
spirit,  our human evolution commenced at once,  being confined particularly
to the Polar Region of the Sun.

   The  highest evolved beings which were to become human were the first  to
appear.   The substances which now from the Earth were all molten,  and  the
atmosphere now from the Earth were all molten,  and the atmosphere was  gas-
eous, yet man recapitulated his mineral stage anew.

   From that attenuated chemical substance of the sun man himself built  his
first mineral body, assisted by the Lords of Form.  If this statement is ob-
jected to on the ground that man could not build unconsciously,  the case of
the mother can be cited in answer.  Is she conscious of building the body of
the babe in her womb?  Yet surely no one will say that she has nothing to do
with  it!   The only difference is that the mother builds unconsciously  for
the babe; and man built unconsciously for himself.

   Man's first dense body did not even remotely resemble his present  splen-
didly  organized  vehicle.   That has been evolved only  in  the  course  of
myriads of years.   The first dense body was a large,  baggy object with  an
opening at the top, from which an organ projected.  This was a kind of organ


[PAGE 262]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

of  orientation and direction.   In the course of time the dense  body  drew
more  closely  together and condensed.   If it came too close to  places  of
greater heat than it could endure, it disintegrated.  In time the organ grew
sensitive  to the condition that threatened destruction and the  dense  body
automatically moved to a safer place.

   This  organ  has now degenerated into what is called  the  pineal  gland.
Sometimes it is called "the third eye," but that is a misnomer,  because  it
never was an eye, but rather the localized organ for the sensing of heat and
cold,  which faculty is now distributed over the entire dense body.   During
the Polarian Epoch this sense was thus localized,  as the sense of sight  is
now in the eye,  and that of hearing in the ear.  The extension of the sense
of  feeling  since that time indicates the manner in which the  entire  body
will be improved, so that at some future time any part of it will be able to
perceive all things.   The senses of sign and hearing will be extended  over
the entire body,  as the sense of feeling is now.  Them man will be all eyes
and ears.   Specialized sense organs indicate limitation.   Sense perception
by the whole is comparative perfection.

   At  the  early  stage of which we are now speaking there was  a  kind  of
propagation.   These immense baggy creatures divided in halves in  a  manner
similar  to  the division of cells by fission,  but the  separated  portions
would not grow, each remaining only half as large as the original form.

                          THE HYPERBOREAN EPOCH.

   At different points on the fiery globe there began in the course of  time
the formation of crust-islands in a sea of fire.

   The  Lords  of  Form  appeared,  with  the  Angels  (humanity of the Moon


[PAGE 263]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

Period), and clothed man's dense form with a vital body.  Those baggy bodies
then began to increase in size by drawing themselves material from the  out-
side osmosis,  as it were.  When they propagated, it was no longer by divid-
ing into halves,  but into two un-equal parts.   Both parts grew until  each
had attained the original size of the parent.

   As  the Polarian Epoch was really a recapitulation of the Saturn  Period,
it  may be said that during that time man passed through the mineral  state;
he had the same vehicle--the dense body--and a consciousness similar to  the
trance state.   For analogous reasons, the plant state was passed through in
the  Hyperborean  Epoch,  as  man  had  a dense  and  a  vital  body  and  a
dreamless-sleep-consciousness.

   Man began his evolution on the Earth after Mars had been thrown off  from
the  central mass,  and that which is now the Earth was yet undetached  from
the Sun; but at the close of the Hyperborean Epoch the incrustation had pro-
gressed so far that it had become an obstacle to the progress of some of the
higher  evolved  beings in the Sun.  The fiery condition also  hindered  the
evolution of some of the lower grades of creatures, such as man, who at that
stage required a denser world for his further development.   Therefore,  the
part  which is now the Earth was thrown off from the Sun at the end  of  the
Hyperborean  Epoch,  and commenced to revolve around the parent  body  in  a
somewhat different orbit than at present.  Shortly afterwards Venus and Mer-
cury were thrown off for similar reasons.

   Crystallization always commences at the pole of a planet where motion  is
slow.  The consolidated part gradually works outwards towards the equator in


[PAGE 264]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

obedience to the centrifugal force.   If that force is stronger than the co-
hesive tendency the consolidated mass is thrown outwards into space.

   At  the time when the Earth-globe was separated from the parent-mass,  it
included that part which is now our Moon.   On this great globe was evolving
the  life wave now passing through the human kingdom,  also the  life  waves
which entered evolution in the Sun,  Moon,  and Earth Periods,  and are  now
evolving through the animal, plant and mineral kingdoms.

   Mention  has been made of the stragglers of various Periods who in  later
Periods were enabled to take a step upward in evolution.   There were  some,
however,  who did not take this step.  They did not evolve,  and were there-
fore  left further and further behind,  until they became a drag and a  hin-
drance to the progressive ones.   It became necessary to get them out of the
way, that the evolution of the others might not be retarded.

   In the beginning of the Lemurian Epoch, these "failures"  (note that they
were  FAILURES ,  not merely stragglers) had crystallized that part  of  the
Earth  occupied by them to such a degree that it become as a huge cinder  or
clinker,  in the otherwise soft and fiery Earth.   They were a hindrance and
an obstruction,  so they,  with the part of the Earth they had crystallized,
were thrown out into space beyond recall.  That is the genesis of the Moon.

                       THE MOON--THE EIGHTH SPHERE.

   The seven Globes,  A to G,  inclusive,  are the field of Evolution.   The
Moon is the field of Disintegration.

   If Earth had not segregated from the original Globe which is now the Sun,
the rapidity of the vibrations would have disintegrated man's vehicles.   He
would have grown so rapidly that the growth of the  mushroom would seem slow


[PAGE 265]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

in comparison.   He would have become old before he had time to pass through
youth.   That such is the effect of too much Sun is shown by the rapidity of
growth  at the tropics,  where maturity and old age are reached much  sooner
than in the north.   On the other hand had the Moon remained with the Earth,
man would have crystallized into a statue.  The separation of the Earth from
the Sun,  which now sends its rays from a far distance,  enables man to live
at  the proper rate of vibration, to unfold slowly.   The Moon-forces  reach
him  from the exact distance necessary to enable him to build a body of  the
proper density.   But although the latter forces are active in the  building
of the form.,  they also cause death when their continued work finally crys-
tallizes the tissues of the body.

   The  Sun works in the vital body and is the force which makes  for  life,
and wars against the death-dealing Moon force.

                            THE LEMURIAN EPOCH.

   In  this Epoch appeared the Archangels (the humanity of Sun Period).  and
the Lords of Mind (the humanity of Saturn Period).   These Hierarchies  were
assisted  by the Lords of Form,  who were given charge of the Earth  Period.
They  helped man to build his desire body,  and the Lords of Mind  gave  the
germ of Mind to the greater part of the pioneers who formed class 1, accord-
ing to the classification in diagram 10.

   The Lords of Form vivified the Human spirit in as many of the  stragglers
of  the Moon Period as had made the necessary progress in the three and  one
half  Revolutions which had elapsed since the commencement of the Earth  Pe-
riod, but at that time the Lords of Mind could  not  give  them  the germ of


[PAGE 266]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Mind.   Thus a great part of nascent humanity was left without this link be-
tween the threefold spirit and the threefold body.

   The  Lords of Mind took charge of the higher part of the desire body  and
of  the  germinal  mind,  impregnating them with  the  quality  of  separate
selfhood,  without which no separate,  self-contained beings such as we  are
today would be possible.

   We owe to the Lords of Mind the separate personality,  with all the  pos-
sibilities  for experience and growth thus afforded.   And this point  marks
the birth of the Individual.

                         BIRTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL.

   Diagram 1 will make clear the fact that the personality is the  reflected
picture of the Spirit, the mind being the mirror, or focus.

   As when reflected in a pond, the images of trees appear inverted, the fo-
liage seeming to be the deepest down in the water,  so the highest aspect of
the  spirit (the Divine Spirit) finds its counterpart in the lowest  of  the
three bodies (the dense body).  The next highest spirit (the life spirit) is
reflected in the next lowest body (the vital body).   The third spirit  (the
human spirit) and its reflection,  the third body (the desire body),  appear
closest of all to the reflecting mirror, which is the mind,  the latter cor-
responding to the surface of the pond--the reflecting medium in our analogy.

   The  Spirit  came down from the higher Worlds during involution;  and  by
concurrent action,  the Bodies were built upward in the same period.   It is
the  meeting of these two streams in the focusing Mind that marks the  point
in time when the individual, the human being,  the  Ego,  is  born--when the


[PAGE 267]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

Spirit takes possession of its vehicles.

   Yet we must not suppose that this at once raised man to his present  sta-
tus in evolution, making him the self conscious, thinking being he is today.
Before that point could be reached a long and weary road had to be traveled,
for  at the time we are considering,  organs were in their most  rudimentary
stage and there was no brain that could be used as an instrument of  expres-
sion.   Hence the consciousness was the dimmest imaginable.   In short,  the
man  of that day was very far from being as intelligent as  our  present-day
animals.  The first step in the direction of improvement was the building of
a  brain  to use as an instrument of mind in the Physical World.   That  was
achieved by separating humanity into sexes.

                         SEPARATION OF THE SEXES.

   Contrary to the generally accepted idea, the Ego is bisexual.   Were  the
Ego sexless, the body would necessarily be sexless also, for the body is but
the external symbol of the indwelling spirit.

   The sex of the Ego does not, of course,  express itself a such in the in-
ner worlds.  It manifests there as two distinct qualities--Will and Imagina-
tion.  The Will is the male power and is allied to the Sun forces;  Imagina-
tion  is  the female power and is always linked to the  Moon  forces.   This
accounts for the imaginative trend of woman and for the special power  which
the Moon exercises over the female organism.

   When  the matter of which the Earth and the Moon were  afterwards  formed
was still a part of the Sun, the body of man-in-the-making was yet  plastic,
and the forces from that  part  which  afterwards  became Sun, and that part


[PAGE 268]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

which  is  now Moon worked readily in all bodies,  so that the  man  of  the
Hyperborean Epoch was hemaphrodite--capable of producing another being  from
himself without intercourse with any other.

   When  the Earth separated from the Sun and shortly afterwards  threw  off
the Moon,  the forces from the two luminaries did not find equal  expression
in all,  as formerly.   Some bodies become more amenable to the forces  from
one, and some to those from the other.

                            INFLUENCE OF MARS.

   In  the  part  of  the  Earth Period  preceding  the  separation  of  the
sexes--during  the three and one-half Revolutions which  intervened  between
the  time  when Mars was differentiated and the beginning  of  the  Lemurian
Epoch--Mars  traveled in a different orbit from the present,  and  its  aura
(that part of its finer vehicles which extends beyond the dense planet) per-
meated the body of the central planet and polarized the iron with it.

   As iron is essential to the production of warm, red blood,  all creatures
were  cold-blooded,  or rather,  the fluid parts of the body were no  warmer
than the surrounding atmosphere.

   When the Earth was set free from the Central Sun,  that event changed the
orbits  of the planets and thus the influence of Mars over the iron  in  the
Earth was minimized.   The Planetary Spirit of Mars finally withdrew the re-
mainder of that influence,  and although the desire bodies of the Earth  and
Mars still penetrate, the dynamic power of Mars over the iron (which is Mars
metal)  has ceased and iron (which is a Mars metal) has ceased and iron  has
become available for use on our planet.

   Iron  is in reality the basis of separate existence.   Without  iron  the
red, heat-giving blood would be an impossibility,  and the Ego could have no


[PAGE 269]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

hold  in  the body.   When red blood developed--in the latter  part  of  the
Lemurian  Epoch--the body become upright and the time had come when the  Ego
could begin to dwell within the body and control it.

   But to dwell within is not the end and aim of evolution.   It is simply a
means  by  which the Ego may better express itself through  its  instrument,
that it may manifest in the Physical World.   To that end the sense  organs,
the larynx, and above all, a brain, must be built and perfected.

   During the early part of the Hyperborean Epoch, while the Earth was still
united with the Sun,  the solar forces supplied man with all the  sustenance
he  needed  and  he unconsciously radiated the surplus for  the  purpose  of
propagation.

   When the Ego entered into possession of its vehicles it became  necessary
to  use  part of this force for the building of the brain and  larynx.   The
latter  was originally a part of the creative organ.   The larynx was  built
while the dense body was yet bent together in the bag-like shape already de-
scribed,  which is still the form of the human embryo.   As the  dense  body
straightened  and became upright,  part of the creative organ remained  with
the upper part of the dense body and later became the larynx.

   Thus the dual creative force which had hitherto worked is only one direc-
tion,  for the purpose of the creating another being,  became divided.   One
part  was directed upward to build the brain and larynx,  by means of  which
the  Ego  was to become capable of thinking and  communicating  thoughts  to
other beings.

   As  a result of this change only one part of the force essential  in  the
creation of another being was available to one individual,  hence it  became
necessary for each individual  to  seek  the  co-operation  of  another, who


[PAGE 270]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

possessed that part of the procreative force which the seeker lacked.

   Thus  did the evolving entity obtain brain consciousness of  the  outside
world  at the cost of half its creative power.   Previous to that  time,  it
used  within itself both parts of that power to externalize  another  being.
As a result of that modification,  however, it has evolved the power to cre-
ate  and express thought.   Before then,  it was a creator in  the  physical
world only; since then it has become able to create in the three worlds.

                       THE RACES AND THEIR LEADERS.

   Before  considering  in detail the evolution of the Lemurians it  may  be
well to take a general survey of the Races and their Leaders.

   Some  very valuable works on Occultism,  bringing before the  public  the
teachings  of the Eastern Wisdom, have nevertheless contained  certain  mis-
takes,  owing  to a misunderstanding of the teachings by those who  were  so
fortunate as to receive them.   All books, not written directly by the Elder
Brothers, are liable to contain such errors.  Considering the extreme intri-
cacy and many complications of the subject,  the wonder is not that mistakes
do occur,  but that they are not more frequent.   Therefore the writer  does
not  presume to criticise,  recognizing that more numerous and more  serious
mistakes may be embodied in the present work, owing to his own misconception
of  the teaching.   He simply sets forth in the next few paragraphs what  he
has  received,  which shows how the differing (and seemingly  contradictory)
teaching  of  two  such valuable works as "The Secret  Doctrine"  by  H.  P.
Blavatsky, and "Esoteric Buddhism," by A. P. Sinnett, may be reconciled.


[PAGE 271]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

   That  part  of  human evolution which is to be  accomplished  during  the
present sojourn of the life wave on our Earth is divisible into seven  great
stages or Epochs;  but these cannot appropriately be called Races.   Nothing
to  which that name could be correctly applied appears until the end of  the
Lemurian Epoch.   From that time different Races succeed one another through
the  Atlantean  and Aryan Epochs,  and will extend slightly into  the  Sixth
great Epoch.

   The  total number of Races--past,  present and future--in our  scheme  of
evolution is sixteen; one at the end of the Lemurian Epoch, seven during the
Atlantean Epoch, seven more in our present Aryan Epoch and one in the begin-
ning  of the Sixth Epoch.   After that time there will be nothing  that  can
properly be called a Race.

   Races  did not exist in the Periods which have preceded the Earth  Period
and they will not exist in those Periods which follow it.   It is only here,
at the very nadir of material existence, that the difference is so great be-
tween man and man as to warrant the separation into Races.

   The  immediate Leaders of humanity (apart from the creative  Hierarchies)
who helped man to take the first tottering steps in Evolution, after Involu-
tion had furnished him with vehicles, were Beings much further advanced than
man along the path of evolution.   They came on this errand of love from the
two planets which are located between the Earth and the Sun--Venus and  Mer-
cury.

   The Beings who inhabit Venus and Mercury are not quite so far advanced as
those  whose present field of evolution is the Sun,  but they are very  much
further  advanced than our humanity.  Therefore they stayed somewhat  longer
with  the  central  mass  than  did  the  inhabitants of the Earth, but at a


[PAGE 272]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

certain point their evolution demanded separate fields, so those two planets
were thrown off, Venus first, and then Mercury.  Each was given such proxim-
ity  to the central orb as insured the rate of vibration necessary  for  its
evolution.   The inhabitants of Mercury are the furthest advanced, hence are
closer to the Sun.

   Some of the inhabitants of each planet were sent to the Earth to help na-
scent humanity and are know to occult scientist as the "Lords of Venus"  and
the "Lords of Mercury."

   The Lords of Venus were leaders of the masses of our people.   They  were
inferior beings of the Venus evolution, who appeared among men and were know
as  "messengers  of the Gods."   For the good of our humanity they  led  and
guided it,  step by step.   There was no rebellion against their  authority,
because man had not yet evolved an independent will.  It was to bring him to
the  stage  where he would be able to manifest will and judgment  that  they
guided him, until he should be able to guide himself.

   It  was  known that these messengers communed with the Gods.   They  were
held in deep reverence and their commands were obeyed without question.

   When  under  the tuition of these Beings mankind had  reached  a  certain
stage of progress,  the most advanced were placed under the guidance of  the
Lords of Mercury,  who initiated them into the higher truths for the purpose
of making them leaders of the people.   These Initiates were then exalted to
kingship  and were the founders of the dynasties of Divine Rulers  who  were
indeed kings "by the grace of God," i.e., by the grace of the Lords of Venus
and  Mercury,  who were as Gods to infant humanity.   They  guided  and  in-
structed   the   kings   for   the   good   of   the   people  and  not  for


[PAGE 273]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

self-aggrandizement and arrogation of rights at their expense.

   At that time a Ruler held a sacred trust to educate and help his  people;
to alleviate and promote equity and well-being.  He had the light of God  to
give him wisdom and guide his judgment.   Hence,  while those kings reigned,
all things prospered, and it was indeed a Golden Age.  Yet, as we follow the
evolution of man in detail, we shall see that the present phase or period of
development,  though it cannot be called a golden age in any but a  material
sense,  cannot be called a golden age in any but a material sense, is never-
theless a necessary one, in order to bring man to the point where he will be
able to rule himself,  for SELF-MASTERY IS THE END AND AIM OF ALL RULERSHIP.
NO  MAN CAN SAFELY REMAIN UNGOVERNED WHO HAS NOT LEARNED TO GOVERN  HIMSELF,
and  at the present stage of development, that is the hardest task that  can
be given him.   It is easy to command others;  it is hard to force obedience
from oneself.

                           INFLUENCE OF MERCURY.

   The purpose of the Lords of Mercury at that time,  and of all Hierophants
of Mysteries since then, as also all the occult schools of our day,  was and
is  to teach the candidate the art of Self-Mastery.   In the measure that  a
man  has  mastered himself,  AND IN THAT MEASURE ONLY,  is he  qualified  to
govern others.   Were the present rulers of the masses able to govern  THEM-
SELVES we should again have the Millenium or Golden Age.

   As the Lords of Venus worked on the masses of a long past ago,  so do the
Lords  of Mercury now work on the Individual,  fitting him for mastery  over
self and (incidentally only,  not primarily) for mastery over others.   This
work  on  their  part  is  but  the  beginning of what will be an increasing


[PAGE 274]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Mercurial  influence during the remaining three and one-half Revolutions  of
the Earth Period.

   During  the first three and one-half Revolutions Mars held  sway,  polar-
izing  the iron,  preventing the formation of the red blood and keeping  the
Ego  from immuring itself in the body until the latter had attained  at  the
requisite degree of development.

   During  the last three and one half Revolutions Mercury will  operate  to
extricate the Ego from its densest vehicle by means of Initiation.

   Incidentally,  it may be noted that, as Mars polarized the iron,  so Mer-
cury has polarized the metal bearing its name and the workings of that metal
will  show  very  well this tendency to take the dense body  away  from  the
spirit--to liberate the latter from the former.

   That dread disease,  syphilis, is an example of condition were the Ego is
fettered and immured in the body to a particularly cramping extent.   Suffi-
cient mercury relieves the condition,  lessens the hold of the body upon the
Ego  and leaves the latter to that comparative freedom within the  body,  an
overdose  of mercury causes paralysis,  thus taking the dense body from  the
man in an improper way.

   The  Lords of Mercury taught man to leave and re-enter the body at  will;
to  function in his higher vehicles independent of the dense body,  so  that
the  latter  becomes a cheerful dwelling house instead of  a  closely-locked
prison--a useful instrument instead of a clogging fetter.

   Therefore occult science speaks of the Earth Period as Mars-Mercury,  and
so it may be said truly that we have been in Mars and are going to  Mercury,
as taught in one of the occult works previously mentioned.  It is also true,


[PAGE 275]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

however,  that we have never inhabited the planet Mars,  nor are we to leave
the earth at some future time to take up our adobe on the planet Mercury, as
the other work mentioned states,  with the intention of correcting an  error
in the first one.

   Mercury, now being in obscuration, is exercising very little influence on
us,  but it is emerging from a planetary rest and as time goes on its influ-
ence  will be more and more in evidence as a factor in our  evolution.   The
coming  Races  will have much help from the Mercurians,  and the  people  of
still later Epochs and Revolutions will have even more.

                            THE LEMURIAN RACE.

   We are now in a position to understand the information which is to follow
concerning  the people who lived IN THE LATTER PART of the  Lemurian  Epoch,
whom we may call the Lemurian Race.

   The  atmosphere  of  Lemuria  was still  very  dense--somewhat  like  the
fire-fog  of the Moon Period,  but denser.  The crust of the Earth was  just
starting to become quite hard and solid in some places,  while in others  it
was still fiery, and between islands of crust was a sea of boiling, seething
water.   Volcanic outbursts and cataclysms marked this time when the  nether
fires fought hard against the formation of the encircling wall which was  to
imprison them.

   Upon the harder and comparatively cool spots man lived surrounded by  gi-
ant  fern-forests and animals of enormous size.   The forms of both man  and
animal were yet quite plastic.  The skeleton had formed, but man himself had
great  power  in molding the flesh of his own body and that of  the  animals
about him.


[PAGE 276]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   When he was born he could hear and feel,  but his perception of light cam
later.   We have analogous cases in animals like cats and dogs, the young of
which receive the sense of sight some time after birth.  The Lemurian had no
eyes.   He had two sensitive spots which were affected by the light  of  the
Sun  as it shone dimly through the fiery atmosphere of ancient Lemuria,  but
is  was not until nearly the close of the Atlantean Epoch that he had  sight
as  we  have  it today.   Up to that time the building of  the  eye  was  in
progress.   While  the Sun was within--while the Earth formed  part  of  the
light-giving mass--man need no external illuminant; he was luminous himself.
But when the dark Earth was separated from the Sun it became necessary  that
the  light should be perceived,  therefore as the light rays  impinged  upon
man,  he perceived them.  Nature built the eye as a light-perceiver,  in re-
sponse to the demand of the already-existing function,  which is  invariable
the case, as Professor Huxley has so ably shown.  The amoeba has no stomach,
yet it digests.   It is all stomach.  The necessity for digesting food built
in  the stomach in the course of time,  but digestion took place before  the
alimentary  canal was formed.   In an analogous manner,  the  perception  of
light  called forth the eye.   The light itself built the eye and  maintains
it.   Where there is no light there can be no eye.   In cases where  animals
have  withdrawn  and dwelt in caves--keeping away from the  light--the  eyes
have degenerated and atrophied because there were no light rays to  maintain
them and no eyes were needed in the dark caves.   The Lemurian needed  eyes;
he had a perception of light,  and the light was commencing to build the eye
in response to his demand.

   His  language consisted of sounds like those of Nature.   The sighing  of
the  wind  in  the  immense  forests  which grew in great luxuriance in that


[PAGE 277]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

super-tropical  climate,  the  rippling of the brook,  the  howling  of  the
tempest--for Lemuria was storm-swept--the thunder of the waterfall, the roar
of  the volcano--all these were to him voices of the Gods from whom he  knew
himself to have descended.

   Of the birth of his body he knew nothing.   He could not SEE either it or
anything else, but he did PERCEIVE his fellow beings.  It was,  however,  an
inner perception,  like our perception of persons and things in dreams,  but
with this very important difference, that his dream-perception was clear and
rational.

   Thus  he knew nothing at all about his body,  in fact he did not know  he
had  a  body any more than we know we have a stomach when that organ  is  in
good health.   We remember its existence only when our abuse of it causes us
to feel pain there.   Under normal conditions we are entirely unconscious of
its  processes.   Similarly did the body of the Lemurian  serve  him  excel-
lently,  although he was unaware of its existence.   Pain was the  means  of
making him aware of his body and of the world without.

   Everything in connection with the propagation of the race and the  bring-
ing to birth was done by direction of the Angels under the leadership of Je-
hovah,  the Regent of the Moon.  The propagative function was  performed  as
stated  times of the year when the lines of force,  running from  planet  to
planet, were focussed at proper angles.  Thus the creative force encountered
no obstruction and parturition was painless.  Man was unaware of birth,  be-
cause  at  that time he was unconscious of the physical world as he  now  is
during sleep.   It was only in the intimate contact of sex relation that the
spirit  became  aware  of  the  flesh and them man "knew" his wife.  That is


[PAGE 278]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

shown  is such passages of the Bible as "Adam KNEW Eve and she  bore  Seth";
"Elkanah KNEW Hannah and she bore Samuel"; and Mary's question, "How I shall
conceive, seeing I KNOW no man?"  This is also the key to the meaning of the
"Tree of Knowledge," the fruit of which opened the eyes of Adam and Eve,  so
that they came to know both good and evil.   Previously they had known  only
good,  but when they began to exercise the creative function  independently,
they  were  ignorant  of  stellar  influences,  as  their  descendants,  and
Jehovah's supposed curse was not a curse at all,  but a simple statement  of
the result which must inevitably follow use of their generative force  which
failed  to take into consideration the effect of the stellar rays on  child-
birth.

   Thus  the ignorant use of the generative force is  primarily  responsible
for pain, sickness and sorrow.

   The Lemurian knew no death because when, in the course of long ages,  his
body dropped away, he entered another, quite unconscious of the change.  His
consciousness was not focussed in the physical world,  therefore the  laying
aside  of one body and the taking of another was no more to him than a  leaf
or  twig drying and falling away from the tree and being replaced by  a  new
growth.

   Their  language was to the Lemurians something holy.   It was not a  dead
language  like  ours--a  mere orderly arrangements of  sounds.   Each  sound
uttered by the Lemurian had power over his fellow-beings,  over the  animals
and even over nature around him.  Therefore, under the guidance of the Lords
of  Venus,  who  were  the messengers of God--the  agents  of  the  creative
hierarchies--  the power of speech was used with great reverence,  as  some-
thing most holy.

   The  education of the boys differed greatly from that of the girls.   The
Lemurian   methods   of   education   seem  shocking  to  our  more  refined


[PAGE 279]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

sensibilities.   In  order to spare the reader's feelings,  only  the  least
cruel  of them will be touched upon.  Strenuous in the extreme as  they  may
seen,  it  must  be  remembered that the Lemurian body  was  not  nearly  so
high-strung  as are the human bodies of the present day;  also that  it  was
only  by the very harshest measures that the exceedingly  dim  consciousness
could be touched at all.   As time went on and the consciousness became more
and more awakened,  such extreme measures as those used then became unneces-
sary  and  have passed away,  but at that time they  were  indispensable  to
arouse the slumbering forces of the spirit to a consciousness of the outside
world.

   The education of the boys was designed especially to develop the  quality
of  Will.   They were made to fight one another,  and these fights were  ex-
tremely brutal.   They were impaled upon spits,  with full power to  release
themselves,  but by exercising the will power they were to remain  there  in
spite of the pain.   They learned to make their muscles tense,  and to carry
immense burdens by the exercise of the Will.

   The education of the girls was intended to promote the development of the
imaginative  facility.   They also were subjected to  strenuous  and  severe
treatment.   They were put out in the great forests, to let the sound of the
wind  in the tree tops speak to them and to listen to the furious  outbursts
of flood and tempest.   They thus learned to have no fear of those paroxysms
of  nature and to perceive only the grandeur of the warring  elements.   The
frequent volcanic outbursts were greatly valued as a means of education, be-
ing particularly conducive to the awakening of the faculty of memory.

   Such  educational  methods  would  be entirely out of the question at the


[PAGE 280]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

present day,  but they did not make the Lemurian morbid,  because he had  no
memory.  No matter what painful or terrifying experience he endured,  every-
thing was forgotten as soon as past.   The above mentioned strenuous experi-
ences  were for the purpose of developing memory,  to imprint these  violent
and constantly repeated impacts from without upon the brain,  because memory
is  necessary that the experiences of the past may be used as guides to  Ac-
tion.

   The  education  of  the girls developed the  first  germinal,  flickering
memory.   THE FIRST IDEA OF GOOD AND EVIL WAS FORMULATED BY THEM because  of
their experiences,  which worked chiefly on the imagination.   Those experi-
ences most likely to leave a recollection were thought "Good;"  those  which
did not produce that much desired result were considered "Evil."

   Thus woman become the pioneer in culture,  being the first to develop the
idea of "a good life,"  of which she became the esteemed exponent among  the
ancients and in that respect she has nobly led the vanguard ever since.   Of
course,  as all Egos incarnate alternately as male and female,  there is re-
ally no pre-eminence.  It is simply that those who for the time being are in
a  dense  body of the feminine gender have a positive vital  body,  and  are
therefore  more responsive to spiritual impacts than when the vital body  is
negative as in the male.

   As we have seen, the Lemurian was a born magician.  He felt himself a de-
scendant of the Gods,  a spiritual being;  therefore his line of advancement
was by gaining not spiritual,  but MATERIAL knowledge.   The Temples of Ini-
tiation for the most advanced did not need to reveal to man his high origin;
to educate him to perform feats of magic; to instruct him how to function in


[PAGE 281]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

the desire world and the higher realms.  Such instruction is necessary today
because now the average man has no knowledge of the spiritual world, nor can
he function in superphysical realism.   The Lemurian,  however,  in his  own
way,  did possess that knowledge and could exercise those faculties,  but on
the other hand, he was ignorant of the Laws of the Cosmos of facts regarding
the physical world which are matters of common,  everyday knowledge with us.
Therefore at the School Initiation he was taught art, the laws of Nature and
facts relating to the physical universe.  His will was strengthened and  his
imagination  and memory wakened so that he could correlate  experiences  and
devise  ways and means of action when his past experiences did not serve  to
indicate a proper course of procedure.  Thus,  the Temples of Initiation  in
the  Lemurian times were High Schools for the cultivation of Will-power  and
Imagination, with "post-graduate courses" in Art and Science.

   Yet, though the Lemurian was a born magician, he never misused his powers
because  he felt himself related to the Gods.   Under his direction  of  the
Messengers of the Gods,  already spoken of,  his forces were directed toward
the molding of forms in the animal and the plant worlds.  It may be hard for
the materialist to understand how he could do such work if he could not  see
the world about him.   It is true man could not "see"  as we understand  the
term  and  as he now sees objects outside in space with his  physical  eyes.
Still,  as the purest of our children are clairvoyant to this day while they
remain  in a state of sinless innocence,  possessed an  internal  perception
which gave them only a dim idea of the OUTWARD shape of any object;  but il-
luminated  so  much  the  brighter  its inner nature, its soul-quality, by a


[PAGE 282]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

spiritual apperception born of innocent purity.

   Innocence,  however,  is not synonymous with Virtue.   Innocence  is  the
child of Ignorance and could not be maintained in a universe where the  pur-
pose  of  evolution is the acquisition of Wisdom.   To attain  that  end,  a
knowledge of good and evil,  right and wrong,  is essential,  also choice of
action.

   If,  having knowledge and choice,  man ranges himself on the side of Good
and Right he cultivates Virtue and Wisdom.  If he succumbs to temptation and
does wrong knowingly, he fosters vice.

   God's  plan  is not to be brought to naught,  however.   Every act  is  a
seed-ground for the law of Consequence.  We reap what we sow.   The weeds of
wrong action bear flowers of sorrow and suffering,  and when the seeds  from
then have fallen into a chastened heart, when they have been watered by  the
tears of repentance Virtue will eventually blossom forth.   What blessed as-
surance,  that out of every evil we do, Good will eventually accrue,  for in
our Father's Kingdom naught but Good can endure.

   Therefore,  the "Fall"  with its consequent pain and suffering is  but  a
temporary state where we see through a glass darkly,  but anon we shall  be-
hold again face to face the God within and without,  who is every  perceived
by the pure in heart.

                             THE FALL OF MAN.

   This  is cabalistically described as the experience of one pair  who,  of
course,  represent humanity.   They key is given in the verse where the Mes-
senger  of  the  Gods  says  to the woman, "in sorrow thou shalt bring forth


[PAGE 283]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

children;"  the clue is also found in the sentence of death which  was  pro-
nounced at that same time.

   It  will be observed that previous to the Fall the consciousness was  not
focussed  in  the physical world.  Man was unconsciousness  of  propagation,
birth and death.   The Angels who have charge of and work in the vital  body
(the  medium of propagation) regulated the propagative function and  brought
the sexes together at certain seasons of the year,  using the solar and  the
lunar forces when they produced conditions most propitious for  fecundation,
the  union  being achieved unconsciously by the participants at  first,  but
later it produced a momentary physical cognition.  Then the period of gesta-
tion caused no inconvenience and parturition was painless,  the parent being
plunged in deep sleep.   Birth and death involved no break in the  conscious
and were therefore non-existent to the Lemurians.

   Their consciousness was directed inward.   They perceived physical things
in a spiritual way,  as we perceive them in a dream--at which time all  that
we see is within ourselves.

   When "their eyes opened" and their consciousness was directed outward to-
ward the facts of the physical world, conditions were altered.   Propagation
was directed,  not by the Angels,  but by man,  who was ignorant of the  op-
eration of the Sun- and Moon- forces.  He also abused the sex-function,  us-
ing it for sense-gratification,  with the result that pain attended the pro-
cess  of  child-bearing.   Then his consciousness  became  focussed  in  the
physical  world,  although  all things did not appear  to  his  vision  with
clearly  defined  outlines  until the latter part of  the  Atlantean  Epoch.
Still he came by degrees to know death because of the break made in his con-
sciousness when it was shifted to the higher worlds at death and back to the


[PAGE 284]                                     ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

physical world at rebirth.

   The "opening of the eyes" was brought about in the following manner:   We
remember  that when the sexes separated, the male became an  expression  for
Will, which is one part of the twofold soul-force; the female expressing the
other part,  Imagination.  If woman were not imaginative she could not build
the new body in the womb and were not the spermatozoon an embodiment of  the
concentrated  human will,  it could not accomplish impregnation and so  com-
mence  the germination,  which results in the continued segmentation of  the
ovum.

   These  twin-forces,  Will  and Imagination, are  both  necessary  to  the
propagation of bodies.  Since the separation of the sexes,  however,  one of
these  forces remains within each individual and only the part given out  is
available for propagation.   Hence the necessity for one-sexed being who ex-
presses the complementary soul-force.   This was previously explained;  also
that  the part of the soul-force not used for propagation becomes  available
for INNER growth.  So long as man sent out the full, dual sex-force for gen-
eration,  he  could accomplish nothing in the direction of  soul-growth  for
himself.   But since then the part not used through the sex organ  has  been
appropriated by the indwelling spirit to build the brain and the larynx  for
its expression.

   Thus man built on,  all through the latter part of the Lemurian Epoch and
the  first two-thirds of the Atlantean Epoch until,  by the above  mentioned
use of this half of his sex-force, he became fully-conscious, thinking, rea-
soning, being.

   In  man  the  brain is the link between the spirit and the outside world.


[PAGE 285]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

He  can know nothing of the outside world except through the medium  of  the
brain.   The sense organs are merely carriers to the brain of  impacts  from
without  and  the brain is the instrument which interprets  and  coordinates
those  impacts.   The Angels belonged to different evolution and  had  never
been  imprisoned in a dense and cumbrously slow vehicle such as ours.   They
had learned to obtain knowledge without a physical brain.   Their lowest ve-
hicle is the vital body.  Wisdom came to them as a gift,  without the neces-
sity of laboriously thinking it out through a physical brain.

   Man,  however, had to "fall into generation," and work for his knowledge.
The spirit, by means of one part of the sex-force directed inward, built the
brain  to gather knowledge from the physical world,  and the same  force  is
feeding  and  building  the brain today.  It is subverted  from  its  proper
course inasmuch as it should have gone outward for procreation,  but man re-
tains it for selfish purposes.   No so the Angels.   They had experienced no
division  of  their  soul-powers,  therefore they could send  out  the  dual
soul-force WITHOUT SELFISH RESERVATION.

   The force that goes outward for the purpose of creating another being  is
Love.   The Angels sent our their WHOLE LOVE,  WITHOUT SELFISHNESS OR DESIRE
and in return, Cosmic Wisdom flowed into them.

   Man sends out only part of his love;  the residue he selfishly keeps  and
uses to build his inner organs of expression, to improve HIMSELF;  thus does
his  love  become  selfish  and sensual.  With  one  part  of  his  creative
soul-power he selfishly loves another being because he desires  co-operation
in  propagation.   With the other part of his creative soul-power he  things
(also for selfish reasons) because he desires knowledge.


[PAGE 286]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The  Angels love without desire,  but man had to go through  selfishness.
He must desire and work for wisdom selfishly,  that me may reach selfishness
at a higher stage.

   The  Angels helped him to propagate even after the subversion of part  of
the soul-force.   They helped him to build the physical brain,  but they had
knowledge  that could be transmitted by means of it,  because they  did  not
know how to use such an instrument and could not speak directly to the brain
being.  All they could do was to control the physical expression of the love
of  man and guide it through the emotions in a loving,  innocent  way,  thus
saving man the pain and trouble incident to the exercise of the sex-function
without wisdom.

   Had  that REGIME lasted,  man would have remained simply  God-guided  au-
tomaton and would never have become a personality--an individual.   That  he
had become so is due to a much maligned class of entities called the Lucifer
Spirits.

                           THE LUCIFER SPIRITS.

   These spirits were a class of stragglers in the life wave of the  Angels.
In  the  Moon Period they worked themselves far ahead of the great  mass  of
those  who are now the most advanced of our humanity.   They have  not  pro-
gressed  as far as the Angels who were the pioneer humanity of the Moon  Pe-
riod, however, but they were so much in advance of our present humanity that
it  was impossible for them to take a dense body as we have done;  yet  they
could  not  gain  knowledge without the use of an inner  organ,  a  physical
brain.   They were half-way between man who has a brain and the  Angels  who
need none--in short, they were demi-gods.

   They  were  thus  in  a  serious situation,  The only way they could find


[PAGE 287]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

an avenue through which to express themselves and gain knowledge was to  use
man's physical brain, as they could make themselves understood by a physical
being endowed with a brain, which the Angels could not.

   As  said,  in the latter part of the Lemurian Epoch man did not  see  the
physical  world as we do now.   To him the desire world was much more  real.
He   had   the   dream-consciousness   of   the   Moon   Period--an    inner
picture-consciousness; he was unconscious of the world outside himself.  The
Lucifers  had no difficultly in manifesting to his inner  consciousness  and
calling  his attention to his outward shape,  which he had  not  theretofore
perceived.  They told him how he could cease being simply the servant of ex-
ternal  powers,  and  could become his own master and like  unto  the  gods,
"knowing good and evil."   They also made clear to him that he need have  no
apprehension  if his body died,  inasmuch as he had within himself the  cre-
ative  ability to form new bodies without the mediation of the Angels.   All
of  which  information was given with the one purpose of  turning  his  con-
sciousness outward for the acquirement of knowledge.

   This  the Lucifers did that they might profit by it  themselves--to  gain
knowledge as man acquired it.   They brought to him pain and suffering where
there was none before; but they also brought him the inestimable blessing of
emancipation  from outside influence and guidance,  thereby starting him  on
the  road to the evolution of this own spiritual powers--an evolution  which
will  eventually enable him to upbuild himself with wisdom such as  that  of
the Angels and other Beings Who guided him before,  he first exercised  free
will.

   Before man's enlightenment by the Lucifer Spirits he had not known  sick-
ness,  pain  nor  death.  All  of  these  resulted  from  the  unwise use of


[PAGE 288]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the  propagative faculty and its abuse for the gratification of the  senses.
Animals in their wild state are exempt from sickness and pain, because their
propagation  is  carried on under the care and direction of  the  wise-group
spirit at only those times of the year which are propitious to that process.
The sex-function is designed solely for the perpetuation of the species  and
under no circumstances for the gratification of sexual desire.

   Had man remained a God-guided automaton, he would have known no sickness,
pain,   no  death  unto  this  day;  but  he  would  also  have  lacked  the
brain-consciousness  and independence which resulted from his  enlightenment
by the Lucifer Spirits,  the "light-givers,"  who opened the eyes of his un-
derstanding  and taught him to use his then dim vision to gain knowledge  of
the Physical World which he was destined to conquer.

   From that time there have been two forces working in man.   Once force is
that of the Angels,  who build new beings in the womb by means of Love which
is turned downward for procreation;  they are therefore the perpetuators  of
the race.

   The other force is that of the Lucifers,  who are the instigators of  all
mental activity,  by means of the other part of the sex-force, which is car-
ried upward for work in the brain.

   The Lucifers are also called "serpents"  and are variously represented in
different  mythologies.   More will be said about them when we come  to  the
analysis of Genesis.  For the present enough  has been said to warrant us in
pursuing  the  main  line of investigation' which leads  us  to  follow  the
progress of man's evolution still further,  through the Atlantean and  Aryan
Epochs, down to the present day.


[PAGE 289]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

   What  has been said about the enlightenment of the Lemurians  applies  to
only  a minor portion of those who lived in the latter part of  that  Epoch,
and who became the Seed for the Seven Atlantean Races.   The greater part of
the Lemurians were animal-like and the FORMS inhabited by them have degener-
ated into the savages and anthropoids of the present day.

   The  student is requested to note carefully that it was the  FORMS  which
degenerated.   There is a very important distinction to be kept in mind  be-
tween  the bodies (or forms) of a race, and the Egos (or life) which is  re-
born in those race-bodies.

   When a race is born, the FORMS are ensouled by a certain group of spirits
and  have inherent capability of evolving to a certain stage  of  completion
and no further.   There can be no standing still in nature,  therefore  when
the  limit of attainment has been reached the bodies or forms of  that  race
begin  to  degenerate,  sinking  lower and lower until at last the race dies
out.

   The reason is not far to seek.  New race bodies are particularly flexible
and  plastic,  affording great scope for the Egos who are reborn in them  to
improve  these vehicles and progress thereby.   The most advanced  Egos  are
brought to birth in such bodies and improve them to the best of their  abil-
ity.   These Egos,  however, are only apprentices as yet, and they cause the
bodies to gradually crystallize and harden until the limit of improvement of
that particular kind of body has been reached.   Then forms for another  new
race  are created,  to afford the advancing Egos further scope for more  ex-
tended experience and greater development.  They discard the old race bodies
for  the  new,  their  discarded  bodies  becoming  the habitations for less


[PAGE 290]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

advanced Egos who, in their turn, use them as stepping-stones on the path of
progress.  Thus the old race bodies are used by Egos OF INCREASING INFERIOR-
ITY,  gradually degenerating until at last there are no Egos low  enough  to
profit  by  rebirth  in  such bodies.  The  women  become  sterile  and  the
race-FORMS die.

   We   may   easily   trace  this  process  by   certain   examples.    The
Teutonic-Anglo-Saxon  race  (particularly the American branch of it)  has  a
softer  more  flexible body and a more high-strung nervous system  than  any
other  race on earth at the present time.   The Indian and Negro  have  much
harder bodies and,  because of the duller nervous system, are much less sen-
sitive  to lacerations,   An Indian will continue to fight  after  receiving
wounds the shock of which would prostrate or kill a white man,  whereas  the
Indian will quickly recover.   The Australian aborigines or Bushmen  furnish
an example of a race dying out on account of sterility,  notwithstanding all
that the British government is doing to perpetuate them.

   It  has been said by white men against the white race,  that wherever  it
goes the other races dies out.   The whites have been guilty of fearful  op-
pression  against those other races,  having in many cases massacred  multi-
tudes of the defenseless and unsuspecting natives--as witness the conduct of
the Spaniards towards the ancient Peruvians and Mexicans, to specify but one
of many instances.   The obligations resulting from such betrayal of  confi-
dence and be paid--yea, the last, least iota!--by those incurring them.   It
is equally true,  however, that even had the whites not massacred,  starved,
enslaved, expatriated and otherwise maltreated those older races, the latter
would nevertheless have died out just as surely, though more slowly, because
such   is   the   Law   of   Evolution--the   Order   of  Nature.   At  some


[PAGE 291]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

future time the white race-bodies when they become inhabited by the Egos who
are now embodied in red, black, yellow or brown skins, will have degenerated
so far that they also will disappear,  to give place to other and better ve-
hicles.

   Science speaks only of evolution.  It fails to consider that LINES OF DE-
GENERATION which are slowly but surely destroying such bodies as have  crys-
tallized beyond possibility of improvement.
[PAGE 291 cont'd]                                     EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

                           THE ATLANTEAN EPOCH.

   Volcanic cataclysms destroyed the greater part of the Lemurian  continent
and in its stead rose the Atlantean continent,  where the Atlantic Ocean now
is.

   Material  scientists,  impelled by the story of Plato  to  undertake  re-
searched regarding Atlantis,  have demonstrated that there is ample  founda-
tion for the story that such a continent did exist.   Occult scientists know
that  it existed and they also know that the conditions there were  such  as
shall now be described.

   Ancient  Atlantis differed from our present world in many ways,  but  the
greatest difference was in the constitution of the atmosphere and the  water
of that Epoch.

   From  the southern part of the planet came the hot,  fiery breath of  the
volcanoes which were still abundantly active.  From the north swept down the
icy blasts of the Polar region.   The continent of Atlantis was the  meeting
place of those two currents,  consequently its atmosphere was always  filled
with  a thick and murky fog.   The water was not so dense as now,  but  con-
tained a greater proportion of air.   Much water was also held in suspension
in the heavy, foggy Atlantean atmosphere.

   Through  this  atmosphere the Sun never clearly shone.  It appeared to be


[PAGE 292]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

surrounded by an aura of light-mist,  as do street-lamps when seen through a
dense fog.  It was then possible to see only a few feet in any direction and
the outlines of all objects not close at hand appeared dim,  hazy and uncer-
tain.  Man was guided more by internal perception than by external vision.

   Not  only the country,  but also the man of that time was very  different
from  anything existent on earth at the present time.   He had a  head,  but
scarcely any forehead; his brain had no frontal development; the head sloped
almost abruptly back from a point just above the eyes.  As compared with our
present  humanity;  he was a giant;  his arms and legs were much longer,  in
proportion to this body, than ours.  Instead of walking,  he progressed by a
series  of flying leaps,  not unlike those of the kangaroo.   He  had  small
blinking eyes and his hair was round in section.  The latter peculiarity, if
no  other,  distinguishes the descendants of the Atlantean races who  remain
with  us at the present day.   Their hair was straight,  glossy,  black  and
ROUND in section.  That of the Aryan, thought it may differ in color, is al-
ways OVAL in section.   The ears of the Atlantean sat much further back upon
the head than do those of the Aryan.

   The higher vehicles of the early Atlanteans were not drawn into a concen-
tric position in relation to the dense body,  as are ours.   The spirit  was
not quite an INdwelling spirit;  it was partially outside,  therefore  could
not control its vehicles with as great facility as though it dwelt  entirely
inside.   The head of the vital body was outside of and held a position  far
above  the physical head.   There is a point between the eyebrows and  about
half an inch below the surface of the skin,  which has a corresponding point
in  the  vital  body.  This point is not the pituitary body, which lies much


[PAGE 293]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

deeper  in the head of the dense body.  It might be called "the root of  the
nose."   When these two points in the dense and the vital bodies  come  into
correspondence,  as they do in man today,  the trained clairvoyant sees then
as a black spot,  or rather as a vacant space,  like the invisible core of a
gas flame.   This is the seat of the indwelling spirit in the man--the  Holy
of Holies in the temple of the human body, barred to all but that indwelling
human  Ego whose home it is.   The trained clairvoyant can see with more  or
less distinctness, according to his capacity and training, all the different
bodies  which  form the aura of man.  This spot alone is  hidden  from  him.
This is the "Isis"  whose veil none may lift.   Not even the highest evolved
being on earth is capable of unveiling the Ego of the humblest and least de-
veloped creature.   That, and that alone upon earth, is so sacred that it is
absolutely safe from intrusion.

   These two points just spoken of--the one in the dense body and its  coun-
terpart in the vital body--were far apart in the men of the early Atlanteans
days,  as they are in the animals of our day.  The head of the horse's vital
body is far outside the head of its dense body.   The two points are  closer
together in the dog than in any other animal except, perhaps,  the elephant.
When they come into correspondence we have an animal prodigy, able to count,
spell, etc.

   On  account  of the distance between these two  points,  the  Atlantean's
power  of perception or vision was much keener in the inner Worlds  than  in
the dense Physical World,  obscured by its atmosphere of thick,  heavy  fog.
In the fullness of time,  however, the atmosphere slowly became clearer;  at
the same time,  the point spoken of in the vital body came closer and closer


[PAGE 294]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

to  the corresponding point in the dense body.   As the two approached  each
other,  man gradually lost touch with the inner Worlds.   They became dimmer
as the dense Physical World became clearer in outline.  Finally, in the last
third of the Atlantean Epoch,  the point in the vital body was united to the
corresponding point in the dense body.   Not until then did man become fully
awake in the dense Physical World;  but at the same time that full sight and
perception in the Physical World were gained,  the capability of  perceiving
the inner Worlds were gradually lost to most of the people.

   In an earlier time the Atlantean did not clearly perceive the outline  of
an object or a person,  but he saw the soul and at once knew its attributes,
whether they were beneficial to him or otherwise.   He knew whether the  man
or animal he was regarding was kindly or inimically disposed toward him.  He
was  accurately taught by spiritual perception how to deal with  others  and
how to escape harm.  therefore when the Spiritual World gradually faded from
his consciousness, great was his sorrow at the loss.

   The Rmoahals were the first of the Atlantean Races.   They had but little
memory  and that little was chiefly connected with sensation.   They  remem-
bered colors and tomes,  and thus to some extend they evolved Feeling.   The
Lemurian  had  entirely lacked Feeling,  in the finer signification  of  the
word.   He  had the sense of touch,  could feel the physical  sensations  of
pain,  ease and comfort, but not the mental and spiritual ones of joy,  sor-
row, sympathy and antipathy.

   With  memory  came to the Atlanteans the rudiments of a  language.   They
evolved words and no longer made use of mere sounds,  as did the  Lemurians.
The Rmoahals began to give names to things.   They were yet a spiritual race
and,  their  soul-powers  being  like  the  forces of nature.  They not only


[PAGE 295]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

named the objects around them,  but in their words was power over the things
they named.   Like the last of the Lemurians,  their Feelings as spirits in-
spired them, and no harm was ever done to one another.  To them the language
was  holy,  as the highest direct expression of the spirit.   The power  was
never  abused or degraded by gossip or small talk.   By the use of  definite
language  the  soul in this race first became able to contact  the  soul  of
things in the outside world.

   The Tlavatlis were the second Atlantean Race.  Already they began to feel
their worth as separate human beings.  They became ambitious,  they demanded
that their works be remembered.   Memory became a factor in the life of  the
community.   The remembrance of the deeds done by certain ones would cause a
group  of  people to choose as their leader one who had  done  great  deeds.
This was the germ of Royalty.

   This  remembrance of the meritorious deeds of great men was carried  even
beyond the time when such leaders died.   Mankind began to honor the  memory
of ancestors and to worship them and others who had shown great merit.  That
was  the  beginning of a form of worship which is practiced to this  day  by
some Asiatics.

   The  Toltecs were the third Atlantean Race.   They carried still  further
the  ideas of their predecessors, inaugurating Monarchy and Hereditary  Suc-
cession.   The Toltecs originated the custom of honoring men for  the  deeds
done by their ancestors, but there was then a very good reason for so doing.
Because of the peculiar training at that time,  the father had the power  to
bestow  his  qualities upon his son in a way impossible to  mankind  at  the
present time.

   The  education consisted of calling up before the soul of the child  pic-
tures  of  the  different  phases  of  life.  The consciousness of the early

Atlantean was,  as yet, principally an internal picture-consciousness.   The
power of the educator to call up these pictures before the soul of the child
was the determining factor upon which depended the soul qualities that would
be possessed by the grown man.  The instinct and not the reason was appealed
to and aroused and by this method of education the son,  in the great major-
ity  of cases,  readily absorbed the qualities of the father.   It  is  thus
evident that there was at that time good reason for bestowing honor upon the
descendants  of great men,  because the son almost always inherited most  of
his  father's good qualities.   Unfortunately,  that is not the case in  our
time,  although we still follow the same practices of honoring the  sons  of
great men; but we have no reason whatever for doing so.

   Among the Toltecs,  experience came to be highly valued.  The man who had
gained  the most varied experience was the most honored and sought.   Memory
was  them so great and accurate that our present memory is nothing  in  com-
parison.   In an emergency,  a Toltec of wide practical experience would  be
very likely to remember similar cases in the past,  and suggest what  action
should be taken.   Thus be became a valuable adviser to the community when a
situation developed which none of the members had previously encountered and
they were unable to think or reason from analogy as to how to deal  promptly
with the emergency.   When such an individual was not available,  they  were
compelled to experiment in order to find what was best to do.

   In  the  middle third of Atlantis we find the beginning of  separate  na-
tions.   Groups of people who discovered in one another similar  tastes  and
habits  would leave their old homes and found a new colony.  They remembered


[PAGE 297]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

old  customs  and followed them in their new homes as far  as  they  suited,
forming new ones to meet their own particular ideas and necessities.

   The  Leaders  of mankind initiated great Kings at that time to  rule  the
people,  over whom they were given great power.   The masses  honored  these
kings with all the reverence due to those who were thus truly Kings "by  the
grace of God."  This happy state, however, had in it the germ of disintegra-
tion, for in time the Kings become intoxicated with power.  They forgot that
it  had been put into their hands by the grace of God,  as a  sacred  trust;
that  they were made Kings for the purpose of dealing justly by and  helping
the people.   They began to use their power corruptly,  for selfish ends and
personal  aggrandizement  instead of for the common good,  arrogating  them-
selves  privileges  and authorities never intended for them.   Ambition  and
selfishness ruled then and they abused their high,  divinely derived powers,
for  purposes of oppression and revenge.   This was true,  not only  of  the
Kings, but also of the nobles and the higher classes, and when one considers
the  power possessed by them over their fellow beings of the less  developed
classes,  it is easy to understand that is misuse would bring about terrible
conditions.

   The Original Turanians were the fourth Atlantean Race.   They were  espe-
cially vile in their abominable selfishness.  They erected temples where the
Kings were worshiped as gods, and caused the extreme oppression of the help-
less  lower  classes.   Black magic of the worst and  most  nauseating  kind
flourished and all their efforts were directed towards the gratification  of
vanity and external display.

   The  Original  Semites  were the fifth and most important  of  the  seven
Atlantean  Races,  because in them we find the first germ of the  corrective
quality  of  Thought.  Therefore the Original Semitic Race become the "seed-


[PAGE 298]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

race" for the seven races of the present Aryan Epoch.

   In the Polarian Epoch man acquired dense body as an instrument of action.
In  the Hyperborean Epoch the vital body was added to give power  of  motion
necessary  to  action.   In the Lemurian Epoch  the  desire  body  furnished
incentive to action.

   The  mind was given to man in the Atlantean Epoch to give purpose to  ac-
tion, but as the Ego was exceedingly weak and the desire nature strong,  the
nascent mind coalesced with the desire body, the faculty of Cunning resulted
and was the cause of all the wickedness of the middle third of the Atlantean
Epoch.

   In  the Aryan Epoch Thought and Reason were to be evolved by the work  of
the Ego in the mind to conduct Desire into channel leading to the attainment
of spiritual perfection,  which is the Goal of Evolution.   This faculty  of
Thought  and  of forming Ideas was gained by man at the expense of  loss  of
control over the vital forces--i.e., power over Nature.

   With  Thought and Mind man can present exercise power over the  chemicals
and minerals only,  for his mind is now in the first of mineral stage of its
evolution,  as was his dense body in the Saturn Period.   He can exercise no
power over plant or animal LIFE.  Wood and various vegetable substances, to-
gether  with different parts of the animals, are used by man in  his  indus-
tries.   These  substances  are all in the final  analysis  chemical  matter
ensouled by mineral life,  of which the BODIES in all the kingdoms are  com-
posed,  as previously explained.   Over all these varieties of chemical min-
eral combinations man at his present stage may have dominion,  but until  he
has reached  the  Jupiter Period, that dominion will not be extended so that


[PAGE 299]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

he can work with life.   In that Period, however,  he will have the power to
work with plant life as the Angels do at present in the Earth Period.

   Material scientist have labored for many years in an endeavor to "create"
life,  but they will not succeed until they have learned that they must  ap-
proach the laboratory table with the deepest reverence,  as they would  draw
near to the alter in a Temple--with purity of heart and with holy hands, de-
void of greed and selfish ambition.

   Such is the wise decision of the Elder Brothers,  who guard this and  all
the  deep secrets of Nature until man shall be fit to use them for  the  up-
lifting  of  the race--for the glory of God and not for personal  profit  or
self-aggrandizement.

   It was,  however, this very loss of power over the vital forces which the
Atlanteans suffered that made it possible for man to evolve further.   After
that,  no matter how great his selfishness became,  it could not prove abso-
lutely destructive of himself and of Nature, as would have been the case had
the growing selfishness been accompanied by the great power possessed by man
in his innocent former state.   Thought that works only IN man is  powerless
to command Nature and can never endanger humanity, as would be possible were
Nature's forces under man's control.

   The Original Semites regulated their desires to some extent by the  mind,
and instead of mere desires, came cunning and craftiness--the means by which
those people sought to attain their selfish ends.   Though they were a  very
turbulent people,  they learned to curb their passions to a great extend and
accomplish  their purposes by the use of cunning,  as being more subtle  and
potent  than  mere brute strength.   They were the first  to  discover  that
"brain" is superior to "brawn."


[PAGE 300]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   During the existence of this Race,  the atmosphere of Atlantis  commenced
to  clear definitely,  and the previously mentioned point in the vital  body
came  into correspondence with its companion point in the dense  body.   The
combination  of  events  gave man the ability to see  objects  clearly  with
sharp, well-defined contours; but it also resulted in loss of sight pertain-
ing to the inner Worlds.

   Thus  we  see,  and it may be well to definitely state it as a  law:   No
progress is ever made that is not gained at the cost of some previously pos-
sessed faculty, which is later regained in a higher form.

   Man  built  brain at the expense of the temporary loss of  the  power  to
bring  forth offspring from himself alone.  In order to get  the  instrument
wherewith to guide his dense body,  be became subject to all the difficulty,
sorrow and pain which is involved in the co-operation necessary to the  per-
petuation  of the race;  he obtained his reasoning power at the cost of  the
temporary loss of his spiritual insight.

   While reason benefited him in many ways, it shut from his vision the soul
of things which had previously spoken to him,  and the gaining of the intel-
lect which is now man's most precious possession was at first but sadly con-
templated  by  the Atlantean,  who mourned the loss of spiritual  sight  and
power which marked its acquisition.

   The  exchange of spiritual powers for physical faculties  was  necessary,
however, in order that man might be able to function, independent of outside
guidance,  in the Physical World which he must conquer.   In time his higher
powers  will be regained when,  by means of his experiences in  his  journey
through  the  denser Physical World,  he has learned to use  them  properly.
When  he  possessed  them, he had no knowledge of their proper use, and they


[PAGE 301]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

were  too precious and too dangerous to be used as toys,  with which to  ex-
periment.

    Under the guidance of a great Entity,  the Original Semitic Race was led
eastward from the continent of Atlantis, over Europe,  to the great waste in
Central Asia which is known as the Gobi Desert.   There it prepared them  to
be the seed of the seven Races of the Aryan Epoch,  imbuing them potentially
with the qualities to be evolved by their descendants.

   During all the previous ages--from the commencement of the Saturn Period,
through the Sun and Moon Periods,  and in the three and one-half Revolutions
of the Earth Period (the Polarian, Hyperborean,  Lemurian,  and earlier part
of  the  Atlantean Epochs)--man had been led and guided  by  higher  Beings,
without the slightest choice.  In those days he was unable to guide himself,
not yet having evolved a mind of his own; but at last the time had come when
it  was necessary for his further development that he should begin to  guide
himself.   He must learn independence and assume responsibility for his  own
actions.   Hitherto he had been compelled to obey the commands of his Ruler;
now his thoughts were to be turned from the visible Leaders,  the Lords from
Venus,  whom  he worshiped as messengers from the gods--to the idea  of  the
true God,  the invisible Creator of the System.  Man was to learn to worship
and obey the commands of a God he could not see.

   Their  Leader  therefore  called  the people  together  and  delivered  a
soul-stirring oration, which might be thus expressed:

   Hitherto, you have seen Those who led you, but there are Leaders of vary-
ing  grades  of  splendor,  higher  than  They,  Whom you have not seen, Who


[PAGE 302]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

guided your every tottering step in the evolution of consciousness.

   Exalted above all these glorious Beings stands the invisible God Who  has
created the heaven,  and the earth upon which you dwell.   He has willed  to
give you dominion over all this land, that you may be fruitful and  multiply
in it.

   This invisible God only,  must you worship,  but you must worship Him  in
Spirit and in Truth, and not make any graven image of Him, nor use any like-
ness to picture Him to yourselves, because He is everywhere present,  and is
beyond any comparison or similitude.

   If you follow His precepts, He will bless you abundantly in all good.  If
you stray from His ways,  evil will follow.   The choice is yours.   You are
free; BUT YOU MUST ENDURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR OWN ACTIONS.

   The education of man proceeds by four great steps.   First,  he is worked
upon from without unconsciously.   Then he is placed under the Rulership  of
Divine Messengers and Kings whom he sees,  and whose commands he must  obey.
Next he is taught to revere the commands of a God whom he does not see.  Fi-
nally,  he learns to rise above the commands;  to become a law unto himself;
and, by conquering himself of his own free will, to live in harmony with the
Order of Nature, which is the Law of God.

   Fourfold also are the steps by which man climbs upward to God.

   First, through fear, he worships the God whom he begins to sense,  sacri-
ficing to propitiate Him, as do the fetish-worshipers.

   Next,  he learns to look to God as the GIVER of all things,  and hopes to
receive  from  Him material benefits HERE AND NOW.   He  sacrifices  through
avarice,  expecting  that  the  Lord will repay an hundredfold, or to escape


[PAGE 303]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

SWIFT punishment by plague, war, etc.

   Next, he  is  taught  to worship God by prayer and the living of  a  good
life; and that he must cultivate faith in a Heaven where he will be rewarded
in the FUTURE;  and to abstain from evil that he may escape a FUTURE punish-
ment in Hell.

   At last he comes to a point where he can do right without any thought  of
reward,  bribe, or punishment, but simply because "it is right to do right."
He loves right for its own sake and seeks to govern his conduct thereby, re-
gardless of present benefit or injury,  or of painful results at some future
time.

   The  Original Semites had reached the second of these steps.   They  were
taught to worship an invisible God and to expect to be rewarded my  material
benefits, or punished by painful afflictions.

   Popular Christianity is at the third step.  Esotoric Christians,  and the
pupils  of  all occult schools are trying to reach the highest  step,  which
will  be generally achieved in the Sixth Epoch,  the new Galilee,  when  the
unifying  Christian religion will open the hearts of men,  as  their  under-
standing is being opened now.

   The  Akkadians  were  the sixth and the Mongolians  the  seventh  of  the
Atlantean  Races.   They evolved the faculty of thought still  further,  but
followed lines of reasoning which deviated more and more from the main trend
of  the developing life.   The Chinese Mongolians maintain to this day  that
the  old  ways are the best.  Progress constantly requires new  methods  and
adaptability, keeping ideas in a fluid state, therefore those races fell be-
hind and are degenerating, with the remainder of the Atlantean Races.

   As  the  heavy  fogs,  of Atlantis condensed more and more, the increased


[PAGE 304]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

quantity of water gradually inundated that continent, destroying the greater
part of the population and the evidences of their civilization.

   Great  numbers were driven from the doomed continent by the  floods,  and
wandered  across Europe.   The Mongolian races are the descendants of  those
Atlantean refugees.   The Negroes and the savage races with curly hair,  are
the last remnants of the Lemurians.

                             THE ARYAN EPOCH.

   Central  Asia was the cradle of the Aryan Races,  who descended from  the
Original Semites.  Thence have the different Races gone out.  It is unneces-
sary to describe them here,  as historical researches have sufficiently  re-
vealed their main features.

   In  the present (the Fifth or Aryan) Epoch,  man came to know the use  of
fire  and other forces,  the divine origin of which was  purposely  withheld
from him,  that he might be free to use them for higher purposes or his  own
development.   Therefore  we have in this present Epoch  two  classes:   One
looks upon this Earth and upon man as being of divine origin; the other sees
all things from a purely utilitarian viewpoint.

   The most advanced among humanity at the beginning of the Aryan Epoch were
given the higher Initiations,  that they might take the place of the messen-
gers of God,  i.e.  the Lords of Venus.  Such human Initiates were from this
time forth the only mediators between God and man.  Even they did not appear
publicly nor show any signs of wonders that they were Leaders and  Teachers.
Man was left entirely free to seek them or not, as he desired.

   At  the  end of our present Epoch the highest Initiate will  appear  pub-
licly,  when  a  sufficient  number  of  ordinary  humanity desire, and will


[PAGE 305]                                             EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

voluntarily  subject themselves to such a Leader.   They will thus form  the
nucleus for the last Race,  which will appear at the beginning of the  Sixth
Epoch.   After  that time races and nations will cease to  exist.   Humanity
will form one spiritual Fellowship as before the end of the Lemurian Epoch.

   The names of the Races which have spread over the Earth during the  Fifth
Epoch, up to the present time, are as follows:

         1.---The Aryan, which went south to India,
         2.---The Babylonian-Assyrian-Chaldean.
         3.---The Persian-Graeco-Latin.
         4.---The Celtic.
         5.---The Teutonic-Anglo-Saxon (to which we belong).

   From the mixture of the different nations now taking place in the  United
States will come the "Seed" for the last Race, in the beginning of the Sixth
Epoch.

   Two  more Races will be evolved in our present Epoch,  one of them  being
the Slav.   When, in the course of a few hundred years, the Sun,  because of
the precession of the equinoxes,  shall have entered the sign Aquarius,  the
Russian  people  and  the  Slav Races in general  will  reach  a  degree  of
spiritual development which will advance them far beyond their present  con-
dition.   Music will be the chief factor in bringing this about,  for on the
wings of music the soul which is attuned may fly to the very Throne of  God,
where the mere intellect cannot reach. Development attained in that  manner,
however, is not permanent, because it is one-sided, therefore not in harmony
with the law of evolution, which demands that development,  to be permanent,
must  be  evenly  balanced--in  other  words, that spirituality shall evolve


[PAGE 306]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

through,  or at least equally with, intellect.   For this reason the  Slavic
civilization will be short-lived,  but it will be great and joyful while  it
lasts, for it is being born of deep sorrow and untold suffering, and the law
of Compensation will bring the opposite in due time.

   From  the  Slavs will descend a people which will form the  last  of  the
seven  Races of the Aryan Epoch,  and from the people of the  United  States
will  descend the last of all the Races in this scheme of  evolution,  which
will run its course in the beginning of the Sixth Epoch.

                     THE SIXTEEN PATHS TO DESTRUCTION.

   The  sixteen Races are called the "Sixteen paths to destruction"  because
there is always,  in each Race,  a danger that the soul may become too  much
attached to the Race; that it may become so enmeshed in Race characteristics
it cannot rise above the RACE idea, and will therefore fail to advance; that
it may, so to speak, crystallize into that Race and consequently be confined
to the Race bodies when they start to degenerate, as happened to the Jews.

   In Periods,  Revolutions,  and Epochs where there are no Races,  there is
much more time,  and the likelihood of becoming fossilized is not so  great,
nor  so  frequent.   But  the  sixteen Races are born  and  die  in  such  a
relatively  short time there is grave danger that the one who gets too  much
attached to conditions may be left behind.

   Christ is the great unifying Leader of the Sixth Epoch, and He enunciated
this law when He uttered those little-understood words:  "If any man come to
me,  and  hate  not his father,  and mother,  and wife,  and  children,  and
brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.


[PAGE 307]                                            EVOLUTION ON THE EARTH

   "And  whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me cannot  be  my
disciple.

   ".  .  .  whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath,  he
cannot be my disciple."

   Not that we are to leave, nor underestimate family ties,  but that we are
to rise above them.  Father and mother are "bodies";  all relations are part
of the Race--which belongs to Form.   The souls must recognize that they are
not Bodies,  nor Races, but Egos striving for perfection.   If a man forgets
this,  and  identifies himself with his Race--clinging to  it  with  fanatic
patriotism--he  is  likely to become enmeshed in and sink with it  when  his
compeers have passed to greater heights on the Path of Attainment.

                                CHAPTER XIII.

                             BACK TO THE BIBLE.

   In  our age the missionary spirit is strong.   The Western  churches  are
sending  missionaries all over the world to convert the people of every  na-
tion  to a belief in their creeds; nor are they alone in  their  proselyting
efforts.   The East has commenced a strong invasion of Western  fields,  and
many  Christians  who have become dissatisfied with the  creeds  and  dogmas
taught by the clergy and impelled to search for truth to satisfy the demands
of  the intellect for an adequate explanation of the problems of life,  have
familiarized themselves with, and in many cases accepted, the Eastern teach-
ings of Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.

   From an occult point of view, this missionary effort,  whether from  East
to West or VICE VERSA, is not desirable, because it is contrary to the trend
of evolution.  The great Leaders of humanity Who are in charge of our devel-
opment  give us every aid necessary to that end.   Religion is one of  these
aids,  and there are excellent reasons why the Bible,  containing  not  only
one,  but both the Jewish and Christian religions, should have been given to
the  West.   If we earnestly seek for light we shall see the Supreme  Wisdom
which  has  given us this double religion and how no other religion  of  the
present day is suitable to our peculiar needs.  To  this end we will in this


[PAGE 309]                                                 BACK TO THE BIBLE

chapter  touch again upon certain points previously brought out  in  various
places and connections.

   In the Polarian,  Hyperborean and Lemurian Epochs the task of leading hu-
manity was a comparatively easy one, for man was then without mind, but when
that  disturbing element came in during the first part of the Atlantean  Ep-
och, he developed Cunning, which is the product of the mind unchecked by the
spirit.   Cunning acts as an aid to desire, regardless of whether the desire
is good or bad, whether it will bring joy or sorrow.

   In the middle of the Atlantean Epoch the spirit had drawn completely into
its  vehicles and commenced to work in the mind to produce Thought and  Rea-
son: the ability to trace a given cause to its inevitable effect, and to de-
duce  from  a  given effect the cause which produced  it.   The  faculty  of
Reasoning  or Logic was to become more fully developed in the  Aryan  Epoch,
and  therefore the Original Semites (the fifth race of the Atlantean  Epoch)
were a "chosen people,"  to bring out that germinal faculty to such a  ripe-
ness that it would be impregnated into the very fibre of their  descendants,
who would thus become the New Race.

   To  transmute  Cunning  into Reason proved no  easy  task.   The  earlier
changes in man's nature had been easily brought about.  He could then be led
without  difficulty because he had no conscious desire,  nor mind  to  guide
him, but by the time of the Original Semites he had become cunning enough to
resent limitations of his liberty and to circumvent repeatedly the  measures
taken  to hold him in line.   The task of guiding him was all the more  dif-
ficult because it was necessary he should have some liberty of choice,  that
he might in time learn self-government.  Therefore  a  law was enacted which


[PAGE 310]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

decreed IMMEDIATE REWARDS for obedience and INSTANT PUNISHMENT for disregard
of its provisions.   Thus was man taught,  coaxed and coerced into reasoning
in a limited manner that "the way of the transgressor is hard,"  and that he
must "fear God," or the Leader Who guided him.

   Out of all who were chosen as "seed"  for the new Race,  but few remained
faithful.   Most of them were rebellious and, so far as they were concerned,
entirely  frustrated  the purpose of the Leader by  intermarrying  with  the
other Atlantean Races,  thus bringing inferior blood into their descendants.
That is what is meant in the Bible where the fact is recorded that the  sons
of God married the daughters of men.  For that act of disobedience were they
abandoned and "lost."  Even the faithful died, according to the body, in the
Desert of Gobi (the "Wilderness") in Central Asia, the cradle of our present
Race.   They reincarnated, as their own descendants of course,  and thus in-
herited  the "Promised Land,"  the Earth as it is now.   They are the  Aryan
Races, in whom Reason is being evolved to perfection.

   The  rebellious ones who were abandoned are the Jews,  of whom the  great
majority are still governed more by the Atlantean faculty of Cunning than by
Reason.   In them the race-feeling is so strong that they  distinguish  only
two classes of people:   Jews and Gentiles.   They despise the other nations
and are in turn despised by them for their cunning, selfishness and avarice.
It is not denied that they give to charity,  but it is principally,  if  not
exclusively,  among their own people and rarely internationally, as was done
in  the case of the earthquake disaster in Italy,  where barriers of  creed,
race and nationality were forgotten in the HUMAN feeling of sympathy.

   In such cases as that and the San Francisco disaster, the inner spiritual


[PAGE 311]                                                 BACK TO THE BIBLE

nature  of man becomes more in evidence than under any other  circumstances,
and  the close observer may then discern the trend of evolution.   The  fact
then  becomes manifest that though the stress of ordinary life  our  actions
may deny it,  nevertheless at heart we know and acknowledge the great  truth
that we are brothers and the hurt of one is really felt by all.   Such inci-
dents,  therefore, point out the direction of evolution.  The control of man
by Reason must be succeeded by that of Love,  which at present acts indepen-
dent of and sometimes even contrary to the dictates of Reason.   The anomaly
arises from the fact that Love,  at present,  is rarely quite unselfish  and
our Reason is not always true.   In the "New Galilee,"  the coming Sixth Ep-
och, Love will become unselfish and Reason will approve its dictates.   Uni-
versal Brotherhood shall then be fully realized,  each working for the  good
of all, because self-seeking will be a thing of the past.

   That this much-to-be-desire end may be attained,  it will be necessary to
select another "chosen people"  from the present stock to serve as a nucleus
from which the new Race shall spring.   This choosing is not to be done con-
trary to the will of the chosen.  Each man must choose for himself;  he must
WILLINGLY enter the ranks.

   Races are but an evanescent feature of evolution.   Before the end of the
Lemurian Epoch there was a "chosen people,"  different from the ordinary hu-
manity of that time, who became the ancestors of the Atlantean Races.   From
the fifth race of those another "chosen people"  was drawn,  from which  the
Aryan Races descended,  of which there have been five and will be two  more.
Before a new Epoch is ushered in, however, there must be "a new Heaven and a
new earth";  the physical features of the Earth will be changed and its den-
sity decreased.  There will be one Race at the beginning  of the next Epoch,


[PAGE 312]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

but  after that every thought and feeling of Race will disappear.   Humanity
will again constitute one vast Fellowship,  regardless of all  distinctions.
Races  are  simply steps in evolution which must be taken,  otherwise  there
will be no progress for the spirits reborn in them.   But,  though necessary
steps,  they are also extremely dangerous ones,  and are therefore the cause
of grave concern to the Leaders of mankind.   They call these sixteen  Races
"the sixteen paths to destruction,"  because ,  while in previous Epochs the
changes came after such enormous intervals that it was easier to get the ma-
jority  of  the entities in line for promotion,  it is  different  with  the
Races.   They  are comparatively evanescent; therefore extra  care  must  be
taken that as few of the spirits as possible become enmeshed in the  fetters
of Race.

   This  is  exactly  what  happened to the spirits  reborn  in  the  Jewish
Race-bodies.   They attached themselves so firmly to the Race that they  are
drawn  back  into it in successive births.  "Once a Jew,  always a  Jew"  is
their slogan.  They have entirely forgotten their spiritual nature and glory
in the material fact of being "Abraham's seed."   Therefore they are neither
"fish  nor flesh."   They have no part in the advancing Aryan Race  and  yet
they  are beyond those remnants of the Lemurian and Atlantean peoples  which
are still with us.  They have become a people without a country,  an anomaly
among mankind.

   Because  of  their bondage to the Race-idea,  their one-time  Leader  was
forced to abandon them,  and they became "lost."   That they might cease  to
regard themselves as separate from other peoples, other nations were stirred
up  against them at various times by the Leaders of humanity and  they  were
led  captive  from  the  country  where they had settled, but in vain.  They


[PAGE 313]                                                 BACK TO THE BIBLE

stubbornly refused to amalgamate with others.  Again and again they returned
in a body to their arid land.  Prophets of their own Race were raised up who
mercilessly rebuked them and predicted dire disaster, but without avail.

   As  a final effort to persuade them to cast off the fetters of  Race,  we
have  the  seeming  anomaly that the Leader of the coming  Race,  the  Great
Teacher Christ,  appeared among the Jews.  This still further shows the com-
passion and Wisdom of the great Beings Who guide evolution.   Among all  the
Races  of the Earth,  none other was "lost"  in the same sense as the  Jews;
none other so sorely needed help.  To send them a stranger, not one of their
own Race,  would have been manifestly useless.  It was a foregone conclusion
that they would have rejected him.   As the great spirit known as Booker  T.
Washington  incarnated among the negroes,  to be received by them as one  of
themselves, and thus enabled to enlighten them as no white man could, so the
great  Leaders hoped that the appearance of Christ among the Jews as one  of
their  own  might bring them to accept Him and His teachings and  thus  draw
them  out of the meshes of the Race-bodies.  But sad it is to see how  human
prejudice can prevail.  "He came unto His own and" they chose Barabbas.   He
did  not glory in Abraham,  nor any other of their ancient  traditions.   He
spoke of "another world," of a new earth, of Love and Forgiveness, and repu-
diated  the doctrine of "an eye for an eye."   He did not call them to  arms
against Caesar; had He done so, they would have hailed Him as delivered.  In
that  respect  He was misunderstood even by His disciples,  who  mourned  as
greatly  over their vanished hope of an earthly kingdom as over  the  Friend
slain by Roman hands.


[PAGE 314]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The  rejection  of  Christ by the Jews was the  supreme  proof  of  their
thralldom to Race.   Thenceforth all efforts to save them AS A WHOLE by giv-
ing them special prophets and teachers, were abandoned and,  as the futility
of exiling them IN A BODY had been proven,  they were,  as a last expedient,
scattered among all the nations of the earth.  Despite all, however, the ex-
treme tenacity of this people has prevailed even to the present day, the ma-
jority being yet ORTHODOX.  In America, however, there is now a slight fall-
ing away.   The younger generation is commencing to marry outside the  Race.
In  time,  an increasing number of bodies, with fewer and fewer of the  Race
characteristics,  will thus be provided for the incarnating spirits  of  the
Jews of the past.  In this manner will they be saved in spite of themselves.
They become "lost"  by marrying into inferior Races;  they will be saved  by
amalgamating with those more advanced.

   As the present Aryan Races are reasoning human beings, capable of profit-
ing by past experience, the logical means of helping them is by telling them
of  past stages of growth and the fate that overtook the  disobedient  Jews.
Those rebels had a written record of how their Leaders had dealt with  them.
It set forth how they had been chosen and rebelled; were punished;  but were
yet hopeful of ultimate redemption.   That record may be profitably used  by
us,  that we may learn how NOT to act.  It is immaterial that, in the course
of ages, it has become mutilated, and that the Jews of today are still under
the  delusion of being "chosen people";  the lesson that may be  drawn  from
their experience is none the less valid.  We may learn how a "chosen people"
may harass their Leader, frustrate His plans, and become bound to a Race for
ages.  Their  experience  should be a warning to any future "chosen people".


[PAGE 315]                                                 BACK TO THE BIBLE

This Paul points out in unmistakable terms (Heb. ii. 3-4);  "For if the word
spoken by angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience  re-
ceived  a just recompense of reward,  How shall we escape if we  neglect  so
great salvation?"   and Paul was speaking to Christians,  for the Hebrews to
whom he wrote this were converted,  had accepted Christ and were people whom
he expected would,  in some future life,  be among the new "chosen  people",
who  would  WILLINGLY  follow a Leader and evolve the faculty  of  Love  and
spiritual  perception,  the intuition which shall succeed  self-seeking  and
Reason.

   The  Christian teaching of the New Testament belongs particularly to  the
pioneer  Races of the Western World.  It is being specially implanted  among
the  people of the United States,  for as the object of the new Race of  the
Sixth Epoch will be the unification of all the Races,  the United States  is
becoming  the  "melting pot"  where all the nations of the earth  are  being
amalgamated  and from this amalgamation will the next "chosen  people,"  the
nucleus, be chiefly derived.

   Those spirits,  from all countries of the earth, who have striven to fol-
low  the teachings of the Christ, consciously or otherwise,  will be  reborn
here,  for the purpose of giving them conditions suitable for that  develop-
ment.   Hence  the  American-born Jew is different from  the  Jew  of  other
countries.  The very fact that he has been reborn in the Western World shows
that he is becoming emancipated from the Race spirit, and is consequently in
advance of the crystallized Old World orthodox Jew, as were his parents,  or
they  would not have conceived the idea of severing the old ties and  moving
to America.  Therefore the American-born Jew is the pioneer who will prepare
the path which his compatriots will follow later.


[PAGE 316]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Thus we can see that the Bible contains the teaching peculiarly needed by
the Western peoples,  that they may be taught a lesson by the awful  example
of  the Jewish Race as recorded in the Old Testament,  and learn to live  by
the teachings of the Christ in the New,  willingly offering up their  bodies
as a LIVING sacrifice upon the altar of Fellowship and Love.

                                CHAPTER XIV.

                       THE OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS.

                          LIMITATIONS OF THE BIBLE.

   In  our study thus far,  previous to Chapter XIII,  comparatively  little
reference has been made to the Bible, but we shall now devote our  attention
to  it for some time.   Not that it is intended to attempt a vindication  of
the  Bible (in the form in which it is commonly known to use at the  present
day) as the only true and inspired Word of God, nevertheless it is true that
it contains much valuable occult knowledge.  This is, to great extent,  hid-
den beneath interpolations and obscured by the arbitrary withholding of cer-
tain  parts  as being "apocryphal."   The occult scientist,  who  knows  the
intended meaning, can, of course, easily see which portions are original and
which have been interpolated.   Yet, if we take the first chapter of Genesis
even as it stands,  in the best translations we possess,  we shall find that
it unfolds the identical scheme of evolution which has been explained in the
preceding portion of this work and harmonized quite well with the occult in-
formation in regard to Periods, Revolutions, Races, Etc.  The outlines given
are necessarily of the briefest and most condensed character,  an entire Pe-
riod  being  covered  in a score of words--nevertheless,  the  outlines  are
there.

   Before proceeding with an analysis it is necessary  to say that the words


[PAGE 318]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

of the Hebrew language, particularly the old style, run into one another and
are not divided as those of our language.  Add to this that there is a  cus-
tom of leaving out vowels from the writing,  so that in reading much depends
upon where and how they are inserted,  and it will be seen how great are the
difficulties  to  be  surmounted in ascertaining the  original  meaning.   A
slight change may entirely alter the signification of almost any sentence.

   In addition to these great difficulties we must also bear in mind that of
the  forty-seven translators of the King James version (that  most  commonly
used in England and America), only THREE were Hebrew scholars,  and of those
three,  two died before the Psalms had been translated!   We must still fur-
ther  take into consideration that the Act which authorized the  translation
prohibited  the  translators from any rendition that would  greatly  deviate
from or tend to disturb the already existing belief.  It is evident,  there-
fore,  that the chances of getting a correct translation were very small in-
deed.

   Nor  were  conditions much more favorable in Germany,  for  there  Martin
Luther  was  the  sole translator and even he did  not  translate  from  the
original Hebrew, but merely from a Latin text.  Most of the versions used in
Continental  Protestant  countries today are simply translations,  into  the
different languages, of Luther's translations.

   True,  there have been revisions, but they have not greatly improved mat-
ters.   Moreover,  there  is a large number of people in  this  country  who
insist that the ENGLISH text of the King James version is absolutely correct
from cover to cover,  as though the Bible had been originally written in En-
glish,  and  the  King  James version were a certified  copy of the original


[PAGE 319]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

manuscript.   So the old mistakes are still there,  in spite of the  efforts
which have been made to eradicate them.

   It  must also be noted that those who originally wrote the Bible did  not
intend to give out the truth in such plain form that he who ran might  read.
Nothing was further from their thoughts than to write an "open book of God."
The great occultists who write the Zohar are very emphatic upon this  point.
The secrets of the Thorah were not be be understood by all, as the following
quotation will show:

   "Woe to man who sees in the Thorah (the law) only simple recitals and or-
dinary words!   Because, if in truth it contained only these,  we would even
today be able to compose a Thorah much more worthy of admiration.  But it is
not so.   Each word of the Thorah contains an elevated meaning and a sublime
mystery.  .  .  .The recitals of the Thorah are the vestments of the Thorah.
Woe to him who takes this vestment of the Thorah for the Thorah itself!. . .
The  simple take  notice of the garments and recitals of the  Thorah  alone.
They  know no other thing.   They see not that which is concealed under  the
vestment.  THE MORE INSTRUCTED MEN DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE VESTMENT, but
to body which it envelops."

   In  the preceding words,  the allegorical meanings are  plainly  implied.
Paul also unequivocally says that the story of Abraham and the two sons whom
he had by Sarah and Hagar is purely allegorical (Gal. iv:22-26).   Many pas-
sages are veiled;  others are to be taken verbatim;  and no one who has  not
the occult key is able to find the deep truth hidden in what is often a very
hideous garment.

   The secrecy regarding these deep matters and invariable use of allegories
where the mass of the  people  were permitted to come in contact with occult


[PAGE 320]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

truths will also be apparent from the practice of Christ,  who always  spoke
to  the multitude in parables,  afterward privately explaining to  His  dis-
ciples  the deeper meaning contained therein.   On several occasions He  im-
posed secrecy upon them with regard to private teachings.

   Paul's methods are also in harmony with this, for the gives "milk: or the
more elementary teaching to the "babes" in the faith,  reserving the  "meat"
or  deeper teaching for the "strong"--those who had qualified themselves  to
understand and receive them.

   The Jewish Bible was originally written in Hebrew,  but we do not possess
one  single  line  of  the original writings.   As early  as  260  B.C.  the
Septuagint,  a translation into Greek, was brought forth.   Even in the time
of  Christ there was already the utmost confusion and diversity  of  opinion
regarding  what was to be admitted as original,  and what had been  interpo-
lated.

   It was not until the return from Babylonian exile that the scribes  began
to piece together the different writings,  and not until about 500 A.D.  did
the Talmud appear, giving the first text resembling the present one,  which,
in view of the foregoing facts, cannot be perfect.

   The Talmud was them taken in hand by the Masorete school,  which from 590
to about 800 A.D.  was principally in Tiberias.   With great and painstaking
labor,  a  Hebrew Old Testament was produced,  which is the nearest  to  the
original we have at the present time.

   This  Masorectic text will be used in the following elucidation  of  Gen-
esis,  and,  not relying upon the work of one translator, it will be supple-
mented by a German translator,  the  work of three eminent Hebrew scholars--


[PAGE 321]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

H.  Arnheim,  M.  Sachs, and Jul. Furst, who co-operated with a fourth,  Dr.
Zunz, the latter being also the editor.

                              IN THE BEGINNING

   The  opening sentence of Genesis is a very good example of what has  been
stated about the interpretation of the Hebrew text,  which may be changed by
differently placing the vowels and dividing the words in another way.

   There are two well recognized methods of reading this sentence.   One is:
"In  the  beginning God created the heavens and the earth";  the  other  is:
"Out  of the ever-existing essence (of space) the twofold energy formed  the
double heaven."

   Much  has been said and written as to which of these two  interpretations
is correct.   The difficulty is,  that the people want something settled and
definite.   They take the stand that, if a certain explanation is true,  all
others  must be wrong.   But,  emphatically,  this is not the way to get  at
truth,  which is many sided and multiplex.   Each occult truth requires  ex-
amination from many different points of view; each viewpoint presents a cer-
tain  phase of the truth,  and all of them are necessary to get a  complete,
definite conception of whatever is under consideration.

   The  very fact that this sentence and many others in the vestment of  the
Thorah  can  thus be made to yield many meanings,  while  confusing  to  the
uninitiated, is illuminative to those who have the key, and the transcenden-
tal wisdom of the wonderful Intelligences Who inspired the Thorah is thereby
shown.  Had the vowels been inserted, and a division made into words,  there
would have been only one way of reading it and these grand and sublime  mys-
teries could not have been hidden therein.  That  would have been the proper


[PAGE 322]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

method  to pursue if the authors had meant to write an "open"  book of  God;
but  that was not their purpose.   It was written solely for the  initiated;
and can be read understandingly by them only.   It would have required  much
less skill to have written the book plainly than to have concealed its mean-
ing.   No pains are ever spared, however,  to bring the information,  in due
time,  to those who are entitled to it,  while withholding it from those who
have not year earned the right to possess it.

                             THE NEBULAR THEORY.

   Regarded  by the light thrown upon the genesis and evolution of our  sys-
tem, it is plain that both renderings of the opening sentence in the Book of
Genesis are necessary to an understanding of the subject.   The first  tells
that there was a beginning of our evolution,  in which the heavens were cre-
ated;  the  other interpretation supplements the first statement  by  adding
that  the  heavens  and the earth were  created;  the  other  interpretation
supplements the first statement by adding that the havens and the earth were
created  out  of the "ever-existing essence," not out of  "nothing,"  as  is
jeering pointed out by the materialist.   The Cosmic Root-substance is gath-
ered together and set in motion.  The rings formed by the inertia of the re-
volving mass break away from the central part, forming planets, etc., as the
modern scientist,  with remarkable ingenuity, has reasoned out.   Occult and
modern  science are in perfect harmony as to the MODUS OPERANDI.   There  is
nothing  in  these statements inconsistent with the two  theories,  as  will
presently be shown.   Occult science teaches that God instituted the process
of  formation and is constantly guiding the System in a definite path.   The
modern scientist, in refutation of what he calls a foolish idea, and to dem-
onstrate  that  a  God  is  not  necessary, takes a basin of water and pours


[PAGE 323]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

a little oil into it.   The water and the oil represent space and  fire-mist
respectively.  He now commences to turn the oil around with a needle, bring-
ing in into the form of a sphere.  This, he explains, represents the Central
Sun.   As he turns the oil-ball faster and faster,  it bulges at the equator
and throws off a ring, the ring breaks and the fragments coalesce, forming a
smaller ball,  which circles around the Sun.  Then he pityingly asks the oc-
cult scientist, "Do you not see how it is done?"  There is not need for your
God, or any supernatural force."

   The  occultist  readily agrees that a Solar System may be formed  in  ap-
proximately the manner illustrated.   But he marvels greatly that a man pos-
sessing the clear intuition enabling him to perceive with such accuracy  the
operation of Cosmic processes,  and the intellect to conceive this brilliant
demonstration  of this monumental theory,  should at the same time be  quite
unable  to see that in his demonstration HE HIMSELF PLAYS THE PART  OF  GOD.
His  was  the extraneous power that placed the oil in the  water,  where  it
would have remained inert and shapeless through all eternity had he not sup-
plied  the force that set it in motion,  thereby causing it to shape  itself
into representation of Sun and planets.  His was the Thought which  designed
the  experiment,  using the oil,  water and force,  thus illustrating  in  a
splendid  manner the Triune God working in Cosmic substance to form a  Solar
System.

   The  attributes of God are Will, Wisdom and Activity.   (See  diagram  6.
Note carefully what the name "God" signifies in this terminology.)  The sci-
entist has WILL to make the experiment.  He has ingenuity to supply ways and
means  for  the  demonstration.  This  ingenuity  corresponds to WISDOM, the


[PAGE 324]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

second attribute to God.   He has also the muscular force necessary to  per-
form the action,  corresponding to ACTIVITY, which is the third attribute of
God.

   Further, the universe is not a vast perpetual-motion machine, which, when
once set going, keeps on without any internal cause or guiding force.   That
also is proven by the experiment of the scientist,  for the moment he ceases
to turn the oil-ball the orderly motion of his miniature planets also ceases
and all returns to a shapeless mass of oil floating on the water.  In a cor-
responding manner, the universe would at once dissolve into "thin space"  if
God for one moment ceased to exert His all-embracing care and energizing ac-
tivity.

   The second interpretation of Genesis is marvelously exact in its descrip-
tion of a twofold formative energy.   It does not specifically state the God
is  Triune.   The reader's knowledge of that fact is taken for granted.   It
states  the exact truth when it says that only two forces are active in  the
formation of a universe.

   When the first aspect of the Triune God manifests as the Will to  create,
It arouses the second aspect (which is Wisdom) to design a plan for the  fu-
ture  universe.   This first manifestation of Force is  Imagination.   After
this  primal Force of Imagination has conceived the Idea of a universe,  the
third aspect (which is Activity), working in Cosmic substance,  produces Mo-
tion.  This is the second manifestation of Force.  Motion alone, however, is
not sufficient.  To form a system of worlds, it must ORDERLY motion.  Wisdom
is  therefore necessary to guide Motion in an intelligent manner to  produce
definite results.

   Thus  we  find  the opening sentence of the Book of Genesis tells us that


[PAGE 325]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

in the beginning, orderly, rhythmic motion, in Cosmic Root-substance, formed
the universe.

                          THE CREATIVE HIERARCHIES.

   The second interpretation of the opening sentence also gives us a  fuller
idea  of  God  when  it speaks of the "two fold  energy,"  pointing  to  the
positive and negative phases of the One Spirit of God in manifestation.   In
harmony with the teaching of occult science, God is represented as a compos-
ite Being.  This is accentuated in the remaining verses of the chapter.

   In  addition to the creative Hierarchies which worked voluntarily in  our
evolution,  there  are seven others which belong to our evolution,  and  are
co-workers with God in the formation of the universe.   In the first chapter
of Genesis these Hierarchies are called "Elohim."  The name signifies a host
of  dual  and double-sexed Beings.   The first part of the work  is  "Eloh,"
which is a feminine noun, the letter "h" indicating the gender.  If a single
feminine  Being  were meant,  the work "Eloh"  would have  been  used.   The
feminine plural is "oth,"  so if the intention had been to indicate a number
of  Gods  of the feminine gender,  the correct word to use would  have  been
"Elooth."   Instead of either of those forms, however, we find the masculine
plural ending,  "im," added to the feminine noun, "Eloh,"  indicating a host
of   male-female,    double-sexed   Beings,   expressions   of   the   dual,
positive-negative, creative energy.

   The  plurality  of Creators is again implied in the latter  part  of  the
chapter,  where these words are ascribed to the Elohim:  "Let US make man in
OUR image;"  after which it is inconsistently added,  "HE made them male and
female."

   The translators have here rendered the puzzling  word "Elohim" (which was


[PAGE 326]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

decidedly  not only a plural word but also BOTH masculine and  feminine)  as
being the equivalent of the singular, sexless word,  "God."   yet could they
have  done differently, even had they known?  They were forbidden to disturb
existing ideas.   It was not truth at any price, but peace at any price that
King  James desired,  his sole anxiety being to avoid any  controversy  that
might create a disturbance in his kingdom.

   The  plural "them"  is also used where the creation of man is  mentioned,
clearly indicating that the reference is to the creation of ADM,  the  human
species, and not Adam, the individual.

   We have shown that six creative Hierarchies (besides the Lords of  Flame,
the  Cherubim,  the Seraphim,  and the two unnamed  Hierarchies  which  have
passed into liberation) were active in assisting the virgin spirits which in
themselves form a seventh Hierarchy.

   The  Cherubim  and the Seraphim had nothing to do with  the  creation  of
Form;  therefore they are not mentioned in the chapter under  consideration,
which deals principally with the Form-side of Creation.   Here we find  men-
tioned  only  the seven creative Hierarchies which did the  actual  work  of
bringing man to where he acquired a dense physical form,  through which  the
indwelling spirit could work.

   After  a  description of teach part of the work of Creation it  is  said:
"and Elohim saw that it was good."  This is said seven times,  the last time
being on the sixth day, when the human form had been created.

   It is stated that on the seventh day "Elohim rested."  This is all in ac-
cord with our occult teaching of the part taken by each of the creative  Hi-
erarchies  in  the work of evolution down to the present Period.  It is also


[PAGE 327]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

taught  that  in the present Epoch the Gods and  creative  Hierarchies  have
withdrawn  from active participation,  that man may work out his own  salva-
tion,  leaving  the necessary guidance of ordinary humanity  to  the  "Elder
Brothers," who are now the mediators between man and the Gods.

                             THE SATURN PERIOD.

   Having satisfied ourselves that the beginning of our System and the  work
of the creative Hierarchies, as described by occult science,  harmonize with
the teachings of the Bible, we will now examine the Bible account of differ-
ent  "Days  of Creation"  and see how they agree with the  occult  teachings
relative  to  the Saturn,  Sun,  and Moon Periods;  the three  and  one-half
Revolutions  of the Earth Period; and the Polarian,  Hyperborean,  Lemurian,
and Atlantean Epochs, which have preceded the present Aryan Epoch.

   Naturally,  a detailed account could not be given in a few lines like the
first chapter of Genesis,  but the main points are there in orderly  succes-
sion, very much like an algebraical formula for Creation.

   The  second verse proceeds:   "The Earth was waste and  uninhabited,  and
darkness  rested upon the face of the deep;  and the Spirits of  the  Elohim
floated  above the deep."   In the beginning of manifestation that which  is
now  the Earth was in the Saturn Period,  and in exactly the  condition  de-
scribed,  as may be seen by referring to the descriptions already  given  of
that Period.   It was not "without form and void,"  as expressed in the King
James version.  It was hot, and thus well-defined and separate from the deep
of space, which was cold.  It is true that it was dark, but it could be dark
and  still  be  hot, for "dark" heat necessarily precedes glowing or visible


[PAGE 328]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

heat.  Above this dark Earth of the Saturn Period floated the creative Hier-
archies.  They worked upon it from the outside and molded it.  The Bible re-
fers to them as the "Spirits of the Elohim."

                               THE SUN PERIOD.

   The Sun Period is well described in the third verse, which says, "And the
Elohim said,  Let there be Light;  and there was Light."   This passage  has
been jeered at as the most ridiculous nonsense.  The scornful query has been
put, How could there be light upon the Earth when the Sun was not made until
the fourth day?   The Bible narrator, however,  is not speaking of the Earth
alone.   He is speaking of the central "Fire-mist,"  from which were  formed
the planets of our system including the Earth.  Thus when the nebula reached
a state of glowing heat, which it did in the Sun Period, there was no neces-
sity for an outside illuminant, the Light was within.

   In  the  fourth verse we read:   "The Elohim differentiated  between  the
light and the darkness."   Necessarily,  for the outside space was dark,  in
contradistinction to the glowing nebula which existed during the Sun Period.

                              THE MOON PERIOD.

   The Moon Period is described in the sixth verse, as follows:  "and Elohim
said,  Let there by an EXPANSION (translated "firmament"  in other versions)
in the waters, to provide the water from the water."  This exactly describes
conditions  in the Moon Period,  when the heat of the glowing fire-mist  and
the cold of outside space had formed a body of water around the fiery  core.
The contact of fire and water generated steam,  which is water in expansion,


[PAGE 329]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

as our verse describes.  It was different from the comparatively cool water,
which  constantly  gravitated toward the hot,  fiery core,  to  replace  the
outrushing stream.   Thus there was a constant circulation of water held  in
suspension,  and also an expansion,  as the steam,  rushing outward from the
fiery  core,  formed an atmosphere of "fire-fog"  condensed by contact  with
outside  space,  returning again to the core to be reheated and perform  an-
other  cycle.   Thus there were two kinds of water,  and a division  between
them,  as stated in the Bible.   The dense water was nearest the fiery core;
the expanded water or stream was on the outside.

   This  also harmonizes with the scientific theory of modern times.   First
the dark heat;  then the glowing nebula;  later the outside moisture and in-
side heat; and, finally incrustation.

                              THE EARTH PERIOD.

   The  Earth Period is next described,  Before we take up its  description,
however,  we have to deal with the Recapitulations.   The verses quoted  and
the  descriptions given will also correspond to the recapitulatory  Periods.
Thus  what is said of the Saturn Period describes also the condition of  the
System  when it emerges from any of the rest of the Periods.   The  descrip-
tions of the Saturn, Sun, and Moon Periods would therefore correspond to the
first three Revolutions of our present Earth Period, and the following would
correspond with conditions on Earth in the present Revolution.

   In the ninth verse, we read:  "And Elohim said, Let the waters be divided
from the dry land. . . .and Elohim called the  dry land Earth."  This refers


[PAGE 330]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

to the first firm incrustation.   Heat and moisture had generated the  solid
body of our present Globe.

   THE POLARIAN EPOCH:  The ninth verse, which describes the Earth Period in
this  fourth Revolution (where the real Earth Period work  commenced),  also
describes the formation of the mineral kingdom and the Recapitulation by man
of  the  mineral stage in the Polarian Epoch.   Each Epoch is also  a  Reca-
pitulation  of  the previous stage.   Just as there are  Recapitulations  of
Globes,  Revolutions,  and Periods, so there are on each Globe,  recapitula-
tions  of  all that has gone before.   These  Recapitulations  are  endless.
There is always a spiral within a spiral--in the atom, in the Globe,  and in
all other phases of evolution.

   Complicated and bewildering as this may appear at first, it is really not
so difficult to understand.   There is an orderly method running through  it
all  and  in time one is able to perceive and follow the  workings  of  this
method,  as a clue leading through a maze.  Analogy is one of the best helps
to an understanding of evolution.

   THE HYPERBOREAN EPOCH is described in verses 11 to 19, as the work of the
fourth day.  It is here recorded that Elohim created the plant kingdom,  the
Sun, the Moon, and the stars.

   The  Bible  agrees with the teaching of modern science that  plants  suc-
ceeded the mineral.  The different between the two teachings is in regard to
the time when the Earth was thrown off from the central mass.   Science  as-
serts  that it was before the formation of any incrustation which  could  be
called  mineral and plant.   If we mean such minerals and plants as we  have
today,  that assertion is correct.   There was no dense material  substance,
but  nevertheless the first incrustation that took place in the central  Sun
was mineral.  The Bible narrator gives only the  principal incidents.  It is


[PAGE 331]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

not  recorded that the incrustation melted when it was thrown off  from  the
central mass as a ring which broke, the fragments afterward coalescing.   In
a body as small as our Earth, the time required for recrystallization was so
comparatively short that the historian does not mention it,  nor the further
subsidiary fact that the melting process took place once more when the  Moon
was thrown off from the Earth.  He probably reasons that one who is entitled
to  occult  information is already in possession of such  minor  details  as
those.

   The  plants of the incrustation of the central fire-mist  were  ethereal,
therefore the melting processes did not destroy them.  As the lines of force
along  which  the ice crystals form are present in the water,  so  when  the
Earth  crystallized,  were those ethereal plant-forms present in  it.   They
were  the  molds  which drew to themselves the dense  material  forming  the
plant-bodies  of  the present day and also of the plant-forms of  the  past,
which are embedded in the geological strata of the Earth globe.

   These ethereal plant-forms were aided in the formation when the heat came
from  outside,  after the separation of the Earth from Sun and  Moon.   That
heat gave them the vital force to draw to themselves the denser substance.

   THE LEMURIAN EPOCH is described in the work of the fifth day.   This  Ep-
och, being the third, is in a sense a Recapitulation of the Moon Period, and
in  the Biblical narrative we find described such conditions as obtained  in
the Moon Period--water, fire-fog, and the first attempts at moving,  breath-
ing life.

   Verses  20 and 21 tell us that "Elohim said,  Let the waters bring  forth
life-breathing things.  .  .and fowl.  . . ; and Elohim formed the great am-
phibians  and  all  life-breathing  things  according  to their species, and


[PAGE 332]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

amphibians and all life-breathing things according to their species, and all
fowl with wings."

   This  also harmonizes with the teaching of material science that the  am-
phibians preceded the birds.

   The  student  is invited to note particularly that THE THINGS  THAT  WERE
FORMED WERE NOT LIFE.   It does NOT say that Life was created,  but "THINGS"
THAT BREATHE OR INHALE LIFE. . . .The Hebrew word for that which they inhale
is NEPHESH,  and it should be carefully noted, as we shall meet it in a  new
dress later.

   THE ATLANTEAN EPOCH is dealt with in the work of the sixth day.  In verse
24  the creation of mammals is mentioned,  and there the work NEPHESH  again
occurs,  explaining that the mammals "breathed life."  "Elohim said, Let the
earth bring forth life-breathing things. . .mammals. . .;"  and in verse 27,
"Elohim  formed  man in their likeness; male and female made  they  (Elohim)
like them."

   The  Bible  historian  here omits the a-sexual  and  hermaphrodite  human
stages and comes to the two separate sexes,  as we know them now.   He could
not  do otherwise,  as he is describing in the Atlantean Epoch,  and by  the
time that stage in evolution was reached there were neither sexless men  nor
hermaphrodites,   the  differentiation  of  the  sexes  having  taken  place
earlier--in  the  Lemurian Epoch.   That which afterward  became  man  could
hardly be spoken of as man in the earlier stages of its development,  as  it
differed but little from the animals.  Therefore the Bible narrator is doing
no violence to facts when he states that man was formed in  the Atlantean E-
poch.

   In verse 28 (all versions) will be found a very small prefix, with a very
great significance:   "Elohim said,  Be fruitful and RE-plenish the  earth."
This plainly shows that the scribe who wrote it was  cognizant of the occult


[PAGE 333]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

teaching  that the life wave had evolved here,  on Globe D of the Earth  Pe-
riod, in previous Revolutions.

   THE  ARYAN  EPOCH corresponds to the seventh day of  Creation,  when  the
Elohim  rested from their labors as Creators and Guides,  and  humanity  had
been launched upon an independent career.

   This  ends the story of the manner in which the Forms were produced.   In
the following chapter the story is told from the point of view which deals a
little more with the Life side.

                           JEHOVAH AND HIS MISSION

   There  has  been much learned discussion concerning the  discrepancy  be-
tween,  and  especially the authorship of the creation story  of  the  first
chapter and that which starts at the fourth verse of the second chapter.  It
is asserted that the two accounts were written by different men, because the
Being or Beings, the name of Whom the translators have rendered as "God"  in
both the first and second chapters of the English version,  are,  in the He-
brew text, called "Elohim" in the first chapter, and "Jehovah" in the second
chapter,   It is argued that the same narrator would have have named God  in
two different ways.

   Had he meant the same God in both cases,  he probably would not,  but  he
was not a monotheist.  He knew better than to think of God as simply a supe-
rior Man, using the sky for a throne and the earth for a footstool.  When he
wrote  of Jehovah he meant the Leader Who had charge of the particular  part
of the work of Creation which was then being described.   Jehovah was and is
one of the Elohim.   He is the Leader of the Angels who were the humanity of
the Moon Period and He is Regent of our Moon.  The  reader  is  referred  to


[PAGE 334]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

diagram 14 for an accurate understanding of the position and constitution of
Jehovah.

   As  Regent  of Our Moon,  He has charge of the  degenerate,  evil  Beings
there,  and He also rules the Angels.  With Him are some of the  Archangels,
who were the humanity of the Sun Period.  They are the "Race-Spirits".

   It is the work of Jehovah to build concrete bodies or forms,  by means of
the  hardening,  crystallizing Moon forces.   Therefore He is the  giver  of
children and the Angels are His messengers in this work.  It is well know to
physiologists that the Moon is connected with gestation; at least, they have
observed  that it measures and governs the period of intra-uterine life  and
other physiological functions.
[PAGE 334 cont'd]                               ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The Archangels,  as Spirits and Leaders of a Race, are known to fight for
or against a people, as the exigencies of the evolution of that Race demand.
In Daniel x:20 an Archangel speaking to Daniel, says, "And now will I return
to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince
of Grecia shall come."

   The Archangel Michael is the Race-spirit of the Jews (Daniel xii:1),  but
JEHOVAH  IS  NOT  THE  GOD  OF THE JEWS ALONE;  HE  IS  THE  AUTHOR  OF  ALL
RACE-RELIGIONS WHICH LED UP TO CHRISTIANITY.  Nevertheless,  it is true that
He did take a special interest in the progenitors of the present  degenerate
Jews--the Original Semites, the "seed-race" for the seven races of the Aryan
Epoch.   Jehovah, of course, takes special care of a seed-race, in which are
to  be  inculcated the embryonic faculties of the humanity of a  new  Epoch.
For  that  reason He was particularly concerned with the  Original  Semites.
They  were  His "chosen people"--chosen to be the seed for a new Race, which


[PAGE 335]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

was to inherit the "Promised Land"--not merely insignificant Palestine,  but
the entire Earth, as it is at present.

   He did not lead them out of Egypt.   That story originated with their de-
scendants and is a confused account of their journey eastward through  flood
and disaster out of the doomed Atlantis into the "wilderness" (the Desert of
Gobi  in Central Asia),  there to wander during the cabalistic forty  years,
until  they could enter the Promised Land.   There is a double and  peculiar
significance  to the descriptive word "promised"  in this  connection.   The
land was called the "promised Land"  because,  as land or earth suitable for
human occupation, it did not exist at the time the "chosen people"  were led
into the "wilderness."   Part of the Earth had been submerged by floods  and
other parts changed by volcanic eruptions, hence it was necessary that a pe-
riod  of time elapse before the new Earth was in a fit condition  to  become
the possession of the Aryan Race.

   The  Original  Semites were set apart and forbidden to marry  into  other
tribes or peoples,  but they were a stiff-necked and hard people,  being yet
led almost exclusively by desire and cunning,  therefore they disobeyed  the
command.   Their Bible records that the sons of God married the daughters of
man--the lower grades of their Atlantean compatriots.   They thus frustrated
the designs of Jehovah and were cast off,  the fruit of such  cross-breeding
being useless as seed for the coming Race.

   These  cross-breeds  were the progenitors of the present  Jews,  who  now
speak  of "lost tribes."   They know that some of the original  number  left
them and went another way,  but they do not know that those were the few who
remained true.  The story of the ten tribes being lost is a fable.   Most of
them  perished,  but  the  faithful  ones survived,  and  from that faithful


[PAGE 336]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

remnant have descended the present Aryan Races.

   The contention of the opponents of the Bible,  that it is a mere  mutila-
tion  of the original writings,  is cheerfully agreed to by occult  science.
Parts  of it are even conceded to be entire fabrications and no  attempt  is
made to prove its authenticity as a whole, in the form we now have it.   The
present effort is simply an attempt to exhume a few kernels of occult  truth
from the bewildering mass of misleading and incorrect interpretations  under
which they have been buried by the various translators and revisors.

                    INVOLUTION, EVOLUTION AND EPIGENESIS

   Having  in the foregoing paragraphs disentangled from the general  confu-
sion  the identity and mission of Jehovah,  it may be that we can  now  find
harmony in the two seemingly contradictory accounts of the creation of  man,
as  recorded in the first and second chapters of Genesis,  in the  first  of
which it is written that he was the last,  and in the second that he was the
first created of all living things.

   We  note that he first chapter deals chiefly with the creation  of  Form,
the second chapter is devoted to the consideration of Life,  while the fifth
chapter  deals with the Consciousness.   They key to the meaning,  then,  is
that we must differentiate sharply between the physical Form,  and the  Life
that  builds that Form for its own expression.   Although the order  of  the
creation of the other kingdoms is not as correctly given in the second chap-
ter as in the first,  it is true that if we consider man from the Life Side,
he was created FIRST, but if we consider him from the standpoint of Form, as
is done in the first chapter, he was created LAST.

   All through the course of evolution--through Periods, Globes, Revolutions


[PAGE 337]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

and Races--those who do not improve by the formation of NEW  characteristics
are held back and immediately begin to degenerate.   Only that which remains
plastic  and pliable and adaptable for molding into new Forms  suitable  for
the  expression of the expanding consciousness; only the Life which  is  ca-
pable of outgrowing the possibilities for improvement inhering in the  forms
it ensouls,  can evolve with the pioneers of any life wave.   All else  must
straggle on behind.

   This  is  the  kernel of the occult teaching.   Progress  is  not  simply
unfoldment;  not simply Involution and Evolution.   There is a third factor,
making a triad--Involution, Evolution, AND--EPIGENESIS.

   The  first two words are familiar to all who have studied Life and  Form,
but while it is generally admitted that the involution of spirit into matter
takes  place in order that form may be built,  it is not so commonly  recog-
nized that THE INVOLUTION OF SPIRIT RUNS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE EVOLUTION  OF
FORM.

   From  the  very  beginning of the Saturn Period up to  the  time  in  the
Atlantean Epoch when "man's eyes were opened" by the Lucifer Spirits, and as
a  consequence  the activities of man--or the Life-force  which  has  become
man--were chiefly directed inward;  that very same force which he now  sends
out from himself to build railways, steamboats, etc., was used internally in
building  a  vehicle  through which to manifest himself.   This  vehicle  is
threefold, like the spirit which built it.

   The same power by which man is now improving outside conditions was  used
during Involution for purposes of internal growth.

   The  Form  was  built  by  Evolution,  the Spirit built and entered it by


[PAGE 338]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Involution; but the means for devising improvements is Epigenesis.

   There is a strong tendency to regard all that is,  as the result of some-
thing that has been; all improvements on previously existing forms, as being
present in all forms as latencies; to regard Evolution as simply the unfold-
ing  of germinal improvements.   Such a conception excludes Epigenesis  from
the scheme of things.  It allows no possibility for the building of anything
new, no scope for originality.

   The occultist believes the purpose of evolution to be the development  of
man from a static to a dynamic God--a Creator.   If the development he is at
present undergoing is to be his education and if, during its progress, he is
simply unfolding latent actualities, where does He learn to CREATE?

   If man's development consists solely in learning to build better and bet-
ter  Forms,  according to MODELS already existing in his Creator's mind,  be
can become, at best, only a good IMITATOR--never a CREATOR.

   In order that he may become an independent, original Creator,  it is nec-
essary that his training should include sufficient latitude for the exercise
of  the individual originality which distinguishes creation from  imitation.
So  long as certain features of the old Form meet the requirements  of  pro-
gression they are retained,  but at each rebirth the evolving Life adds such
original improvements as are necessary for its further expression.

   The  pioneers  of  science  are constantly  brought  face  to  face  with
Epigenesis as a fact in all departments of nature.  As early as 1759, Caspar
Wolff  published his "Theoria Generationis,"  in which he shows that in  the
human  ovum  there  is  absolutely no trace of the coming organism; that its


[PAGE 339]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

evolution  consists of the addition of NEW formations;  a building of  some-
thing which is not latent in the ovum.

   Haeckel  (that  great and fearless student of nature as he sees  it,  and
very  near to knowledge of the complete truth regarding evolution)  says  of
the "Theoria Generationis":  "Despite its small compass and difficult termi-
nology,  it is one of the most valuable works in the whole literature of bi-
ology."

   Haeckel's  own  views  we  find  thus  stated  in  his   "Anthropogenie":
"Nowadays we are hardly justified in calling Epigenesis an hypothesis, as we
have  fully convinced ourselves of its being a FACT and are able at any  mo-
ment to demonstrate it by the help of the microscope."

   A  builder would be but a sorry craftsman were his abilities  limited  to
the building of houses after only one particular model,  which,  during  his
apprenticeship, his master had taught him to imitate, but which he is unable
to later to meet new requirements.   To be successful he must be capable  of
designing new and better houses, improving that which experience teaches was
not serviceable in the earlier buildings.  The same force which the  builder
now  directs  outward to built houses better adapted to new  conditions  was
used  in past Periods to build new and better vehicles for the evolution  of
the Ego.

   Starting  with the simplest organisms,  the Life which now Man built  the
Form to suit its necessities.  In due time, as the entity progressed; it be-
come  evident that new improvements must be added which conflicted with  the
lines previously followed.   A new start must be given it in a new  species,
where it could retrieve any previous mistakes which experience taught  would
preclude  further  development if the old lines were adhered to and thus the


[PAGE 340]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

evolving  life would be enabled to progress further in a new species.   When
later experience proved that the new form also was inadequate,  inasmuch  as
it  could not adapt itself to some improvement necessary to the progress  of
the evolving life, it too was discarded and still another departure made, in
a form adaptable to the necessary improvement.

   Thus by successive steps does the evolving Life improve its vehicles, and
the  improvements  is  still going on.   Man,  who is  in  the  vanguard  of
progress,  has built his bodies, from the similitude of the amoeba up to the
human form of the savage,  and from that up through the various grades until
the  most  advanced races are now using the best and most  highly  organized
bodies  on Earth.   Between deaths and rebirths we are  constantly  building
bodies in which to function during our lives and a far greater degree of ef-
ficiency  than  the present will yet be reached.   If we  make  mistakes  in
building  between lives,  they become evident when we are using the body  in
Earth life, and it is well for us if we are able to perceive and realize our
mistakes, that we may avoid making them afresh life after life.

   But  just as the builder of houses would lag commercially if he  did  not
constantly  improve his methods to meet the exigencies of his  business,  so
those  who persistently adhere to the old forms fail to rise above the  spe-
cies  and are left behind,  as stragglers.   These stragglers take the  form
outgrown  by the pioneers,  as previously explained,  and they  compose  the
lower Races and species of any kingdom in which they are evolving.   As  the
Life which is now Man passed through stages analagous to the mineral, plant,
and animal kingdoms and through the lower human Races,  stragglers were left
all  along  the  way  who had failed to reach the necessary standard to keep


[PAGE 341]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

abreast of the crestwave of evolution.  They took the discarded Forms of the
pioneers and used them as stepping-stones,  by means of which they tried  to
overtake  the others,  but the advanced Forms did not stand still.   In  the
progress of Evolution there is no halting-place.   In evolving Life,  as  in
commerce, there is no such thing as MERELY "holding your own."   Progression
or  Retrogression  is  the Law.   The Form that is not  capable  of  further
improvement must Degenerate.

   Therefore  there is one line of IMPROVING forms ensouled by the  pioneers
of the evolving Life, and another line of degerating forms,  outgrown by the
pioneers,  but ensouled by the stragglers,  as long as there are any  strag-
glers of that particular life wave to which those forms originally belonged.

   When  there are no more stragglers, the species gradually dies out.   The
Forms  have  been crystallized beyond the possibility of being  improved  by
tenants of increasing inability.  They therefore return to the mineral king-
dom, fossilize and are added to the different strata of the Earth's crust.

   The assertion of material science that man has ascended through the  dif-
ferent  kingdoms of plant and animal which exist about us now to  anthropoid
and  thence to man,  is not quite correct.   Man has never  inhabited  forms
identical with those of our present-day animals, nor the present-day anthro-
poid  species;  but he has inhabited forms which were similar to but  HIGHER
than those of the present anthropoids.

   The  scientist sees that there is an anatomical likeness between man  and
the monkey,  and as the evolutionary impulse always makes from  improvement,
he concludes that man must have descended from the monkey,  but he is always


[PAGE 342]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

baffled in his efforts to find the "missing link" connecting the two.

   From the point where the pioneers of our life wave  (The Aryan Races) oc-
cupied ape-like forms, they have PROGRESSED to their present stage of devel-
opment, while the Forms (which were the "missing link") have DEGENERATED and
are now ensouled by the last stragglers of the Saturn Period.

   The  lower monkeys,  instead of being the progenitors of the higher  spe-
cies,  are stragglers occupying the most degenerated specimens of  what  was
once the human form.   Instead of man having ascended from the  anthropoids,
the  reverse is true--the anthropoids have degenerated from  man.   Material
science,  dealing only with Form, has thus misled itself and drawn erroneous
conclusions in this matter.

   The same relative conditions are to be found in the animal kingdom.   The
pioneers  of the life wave which entered evolution in the Sun  pioneers  are
our present-day mammals.   The different grades correspond to the steps once
taken by man, but THE FORMS ARE ALL DEGENERATING UNDER THE MANAGEMENT OF THE
STRAGGLERS.   Similarly,  the pioneers of the life wave which entered evolu-
tion in the Moon pioneers are found among the fruit tress,  while the strag-
glers of that life wave ensoul all other plant forms.

   Each life wave,  however remains definitely confined within its own  bor-
ders.  The anthropoids may overtake us and become human beings, but no other
animals will reach our particular point of development.   They will reach  a
similar stage,  but under different conditions, in the Jupiter Period.   The
present  plants  will  be the humanity of the Venus Period,  under  a  still
greater difference of condition, and our minerals will reach the human stage
under the conditions of the Vulcan Period.


[PAGE 343]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

    It  will be noted that the modern evolutionary theory particularly  that
of Haeckel,  would, if it were completely reversed, be in almost perfect ac-
cord with the knowledge of occult science.

   The monkey has degenerated from the man.

   The polyps are the last degeneration left behind by the mammals.

   The mosses are the lowest degenerations of the plant kingdom.

   The mineral kingdom is the final goal of the forms of all the kingdoms
when they have reached the acme of degeneration.

   A  corroboration of this is found in coal,  which was once  vegetable  or
plant forms; also in petrified wood and fossilized remains of various animal
forms.   Common stone or rock,  which no scientist would admit had it origin
in  another  kingdom,  is to the occult investigator  as  truly  mineralized
plants as coal itself.   The mineralogist will learnedly explain that it  is
composed of hornblende, feldspar, and mica, but the trained clairvoyant, who
can  trace it back in the memory of Nature,  through millions of years,  can
supplement  that  statement  by  adding:   Yes,  and  that  which  you  call
hornblende and feldspar are the leaves and stems of prehistoric flowers, and
the mica is all that remains of their petals.

   The  occult teaching of evolution is also corroborated by the science  of
embryology  in the ante-natal recapitulation of all past stages of  develop-
ment.   The difference between the ovum of a human being and of some of  the
higher mammals, and even of the higher developments in the plant kingdom, is
indistinguishable,  even under the microscope.  Experts are unable  to  tell
which  is  animal  and  which  is  human.  Even after several of the initial


[PAGE 344]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

ante-natal stages have been passed through the experts cannot  differentiate
between and animal and human embryo.

   But if the animal ovum is studied through the entire period of gestation,
it  will  be observed that it passes through the mineral  and  plant  stages
only,  and is born when it reaches the animal stage.   This is  because  the
Life ensouling such an ovum passed through its mineral evolution in the  Sun
Period,  its plant life in the Moon Period, and is now forced to stop at the
animal stage in the Earth Period.

   On the other hand, the Life which uses the human ovum had its mineral ex-
istence in the Saturn Period,  its plant existence in the Sun Period  passed
the animal stage in the Moon Period, has still some scope for Epigenesis af-
ter it has reached the animal stage and therefore goes on to the  human--nor
does it stop there.   The father and mother give the substance of their bod-
ies for the building of the child's body,  but,  particularly in the  higher
races.   Epigenesis makes it possible to add something which makes the child
different from the parents.

   Where  Epigenesis  is  inactive in the  individual,  family,  nation,  or
Race--there evolution ceases and degeneration commences.

                               A LIVING SOUL?

   Thus the two Creation stories harmonize very well.

   One deals with Form, which was built up through mineral, plant and animal
and reached the human LAST.

   The other tells us that Life which now ensouls human forms was manifested
anterior to the Life which ensouls the forms of the other kingdoms.

   One of these accounts of Creation would not have been sufficient.   There
are important particulars hidden  behind the narrative of man's creation, in


[PAGE 345]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

the second chapter;  the verse reads:  "The Jehovah formed man from the dust
of the Earth,  and blew into his nostrils the breath (NEPHESH),  and man be-
come a breathing creature (NEPHESH CHAYIM)."

   In  other places in the King James version NEPHESH is translated  "life,"
but  in this particular instance (Gen. ii.7) it is rendered  "living  soul,"
thus  conveying the idea that there was a distinction made between the  life
that  ensouled  the human form and that which ensouled  inferior  creations.
There is no authority whatever for this difference in translation,  which is
purely  arbitrary.   The life-breath (NEPHESH) is the same  man  and  beast.
This  can be shown even to those who stand firmly upon the Bible as  author-
ity, for even the King James version distinctly states (Eccles.  iii:19,20):
".  .  .as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea,  they all have one breath
(NEPHESH); so that a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast:. . .All go unto
one place."

   The animals are but our "younger brothers,"  and though they are not  now
so finely organized,  they will eventually reach a state as high as our own,
and we shall then have ascended higher.

  It  is contended that MAN received his soul in the way described  in  this
seventh verse of the second chapter of Genesis,  and that he could have  re-
ceived  it in no other way,  it is pertinent to ask where and how WOMAN  re-
ceived her soul?

   The meaning of the chapter,  and of the inspiration of the breath of life
by Jehovah,  is very plain and clear when we use the occult key,  and it has
the further and immense advantage of being logical.

   The  fact  that  the  Regent  of  the Moon (Jehovah), with His Angels and


[PAGE 346]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Archangels, were the principals in this action fixes the time when this cre-
ation  occurred.   It  was between the early and the  middle  parts  of  the
Lemurian  Epoch,  and must have been after the Moon was thrown out from  the
Earth,  because Jehovah had nothing to do with the generation of bodies  be-
fore  the Moon was thrown off.   The forms were then more  ethereal.   There
were no dense and concrete bodies.   It is possible to make such bodies only
by means of the hardening and crystallizing Moon-forces,   It must have been
in  the  first half of the Lemurian Epoch,  because the  separation  of  the
sexes, which is recorded later, took place in the middle of that epoch.

   At that time man-in-the-making had not yet commenced to breathe by  means
of lungs.   He had the gill-like apparatus still present in the human embryo
while passing through the stage of ante-natal life corresponding to that Ep-
och.   He had no warm,  red blood, for at that stage there was no individual
spirit, the entire form was soft and pliable and the skeleton soft like car-
tilage.   Before the later date, when it became necessary to separate human-
ity into sexes, the skeleton had grown firm and solid.

   The work done by Jehovah was to build dense, hard bone substance into the
soft  bodies  already existing.   Previous to this time,  i.e.,  during  the
Polarian and Hyperborean Epochs, neither animal nor man had bones.

                                 ADAM'S RIB

   The grotesque and impossible manner in which the separation of the  sexes
is  said to have been accomplished (as described in the common  versions  of
the Bible and,  in this particular case, in the Masoretic text also) is  an-
other example of what may be dome by changing vowels in the old Hebrew text.


[PAGE 347]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

Read in one way,  the work is "rib"; but in another,  which has at least  as
good  claim  to  consideration,  with  the  additional  advantage  of  being
common-sense,  it reads "side."   If we interpret this to mean that man  was
male-female and that Jehovah caused one side or sex in each being to  remain
latent, we shall not be doing violence to our reason, as we would be accept-
ing the "rib" story.

   When  this alternation is made,  the occult teaching as previously  given
harmonizes with that of the Bible and both agree with the teaching of modern
science that man was bi-sexual at one time,  before he developed one sex  at
the expense of the other.  In corroboration of this,  it is pointed out that
the  foetus  is bi-sexual up to a certain point;  there-after one  sex  pre-
dominates,  while the other remains in abeyance,  so that each person  still
has  the opposite sex organs in a rudimentary form and therefore  is  really
bi-sexual, as was primitive man.

   Apparently the Bible narrator does not wish to give,  in this second cre-
ation account,  an accurate picture of the whole of evolution, but rather to
particularize a little more what was said in the first chapter.  He tells us
that man did not always breathe as he does now;  that there was a time  when
he  was not separated into sexes;  and that it was Jehovah Who effected  the
change,  thus fixing the time of the occurrence.  As we proceed,  it will be
found that much further information is given.

                               GUARDIAN ANGELS

   During the earlier Epochs and Periods the great creative Hierarchies  had
worked upon humanity as it was uncommonly evolving.  There had been only ONE


[PAGE 348]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

COMMON CONSCIOUSNESS among ALL human beings;  one group-spirit for all  man-
kind, as it were.

   In the Lemurian Epoch a new step was taken.   Bodies had been  definitely
formed, but they must have warm, red blood before they could be ensouled and
become the abode of indwelling spirits.

   In  nature no process is sudden.   We would get a wrong idea were  we  to
imagine  that air blown into the nostrils could put a soul into an image  of
clay and galvanize it into life as a sentient, thinking being.

   The  individual spirit was very weak and impotent and quite unfitted  for
the task of guiding its dense vehicle.   In that respect it is not yet  very
strong.  To any qualified observer, it is evident that the desire body rules
the personality more than does the spirit, even at our present stage of  ad-
vancement.   But  in  the  middle of the  Lemurian  Epoch,  when  the  lower
personality--the  threefold body---was to be endowed with the light  of  the
Ego,  the latter, if left to itself, would have been absolutely powerless to
guide its instrument.

   Therefore  it is necessary for someone much more highly evolved  to  help
the  individual spirit and gradually prepare the way for its complete  union
with its instruments.  It was analogous to a new nation,  over which,  until
it becomes capable of forming a stable government for itself,  some stronger
power  establishes a protectorate,  guarding it alike from external  dangers
and internal indiscretions.  Such a protectorate was exercised over evolving
humanity  by  the  Race-spirit,  and is exercised over the  animals  by  the
group-spirit, in a somewhat different way.

   Jehovah is the Most High.  He is Race-God, as one might express it,  hav-
ing dominion over all Form.  He  is the Chief Ruler and the highest Power in


[PAGE 349]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS


maintaining  the  form and exercising an orderly government  over  it.   The
Archangels are the Race-spirits,  each having dominion over a certain  group
of people.   They also have dominion over animals, while the Angels have do-
minion over the plants.

   The Archangels have dominion over races or groups of people and also over
the  animals,  for these two kingdoms have desire bodies and the  Archangels
are expert architects of desire matter,  because in the Sun Period the dens-
est globe was composed of that materials,  and the humanity of that  period,
who  are now Archangels,  learned to build their densest vehicles of  desire
staff  as we are now learning to build our bodies of the  chemical  elements
whereof  our Earth-globe is composed.   Thus it will be  readily  understood
that  the  Archangels  are peculiarly qualified to  help  later  life  waves
through the stage where they learn to build and control a desire body.

   For analogous reasons the Angels work in the vital bodies of man,  animal
and plant.   Their densest bodies are composed of other and so was the Globe
D in the Moon Period when they were human.

   Jehovah and His Archangels,  therefore,  hold a similar relation to Races
that  the group-spirit does to animals.  When individual members of  a  Race
have evolved entire self-control and government,  they are emancipated  from
the influence of the Race-spirit and kindred beings.

   As we have seen, the point of vantage of the group-spirit,  as of any Ego
in  the dense body,  is in the blood.   The Masoretic text shows  that  this
knowledge was possessed by the writer of Leviticus.  In the fourteenth verse
of the seventeenth chapter the Jews are prohibited from eating blood because
". . .the  soul  of  ALL  flesh  is in the blood. . . ;" and in the eleventh


[PAGE 350]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

verse of the same chapter we find these words:   ".  .  .for the soul of the
flesh  is in the blood.  .  .the blood itself mediates for the soul,"  which
shows that this applies to both man and beast, for the word here used in the
Hebrew  is NESHAMAH and means "soul"--not "life,"  as it is rendered in  the
King James version.

   The  Ego works directly through the blood.   The Race-spirit  guides  the
Races by working in the blood, as the group-spirit guides the animals of its
species  through the blood.   So also does the Ego control its own  vehicle,
but with a difference.

   The Ego operates by means of the HEAT of the blood, while the Race (i.e.,
tribal, or family) spirit works by means of the AIR, as it is drawn into the
lungs.   That is why Jehovah,  or His messengers,  "breathed into man's nos-
trils,"  thereby securing admission for the Race-spirit,  Community-spirits,
etc.

   The  different  classes of Race-spirits guided their peoples  to  various
climates  and different parts of the Earth.   To the trained clairvoyant,  a
tribal-spirit appears as a cloud enveloping and permeating the atmosphere of
the  whole  country inhabited by the people under its  dominion.   Thus  are
produced  the different peoples and nations.  Paul spoke of "The  Prince  of
the Power of the Air"; or "principalities and powers," etc., showing that he
knew of the Race-spirits,  but now not even an attempt is made to understand
what they mean,  although their influence is strongly felt.   Patriotism  is
one of the sentiments emanating from and fostered by them.   It has not  now
so much power over people as formerly.  There are some who are being  liber-
ated  from the Race-spirit and can say with Thomas Paine,  "The world is  my
country."  There  are  those  who  can leave father and mother and look upon


[PAGE 351]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

all  men as brothers.   They are being liberated from the Family-spirit,  or
spirit of the Clan which is different from the race-spirit,  an etheric  en-
tity.   Others again, who are deep in the toil of the Race or Family spirit,
will  suffer the most dreadful depression if they leave home or country  and
breathe the air of another Race of Family spirit.

   At  the time of the Race-spirit entered human bodies  the  individualized
Ego commenced to get some slight control of its vehicles.  Each human entity
became  more  and more conscious of being separate and distinct  from  other
men,  yet for ages he did not think of himself PRIMARILY as  an  individual,
but as belonging to a tribe or family.  The affix "son"  to many present day
surnames  is  a remnant of this feeling.  A man was not  simply  "John,"  or
"James."   He was John RobertSON, or James WilliamSON.   In some countries a
woman  was not "Mary,"  or "Martha."   She was Mary Marthasdaughter,  Martha
Marys daughter.   The custom was continued in some European countries  until
within a few generations of the present time;  the "son"  affix remains with
us yet and the family name is still much honored.

   Among  the Jews,  even down to the time of Christ,  the  Race-spirit  was
stronger than the individual spirit.   Every Jew thought of himself FIRST as
belonging to a certain tribe or family.  His proudest boast was that he  was
of the "Seed of Abraham."  All this was the work of the Race-spirit.

   Previous to the advent of Jehovah,  when the Earth was yet a part of  the
Sun, there was one common group-spirit, composed of all the creative Hierar-
chies,  which controlled the entire human family,  but it was intended  that
each  body  should  be  the  temple  and pliable instrument of an indwelling


[PAGE 352]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

spirit and that meant an infinite division of rulership.

   Jehovah come with His Angel and Archangels and made the first great divi-
sion  into  Races,   giving  to  each  group  the  guiding  influence  of  a
Race-spirit--an Archangel.   For each Ego He appointed one of the Angels  to
act  as guardian until the individual spirit had grown strong enough to  be-
come emancipated from all outside influence.

                          MIXING BLOOD IN MARRIAGE

   Christ came to prepare the way for the emancipation of humanity from  the
guidance of differentiating Race- and Family-spirit,  and to unite the whole
human family in One Universal Brotherhood.

   He taught that "Abraham's seed"  referred to the BODIES only,  and called
their  attention  to  the  fact that before  Abraham  lived  (the)  "I"--the
Ego--was in existence.  The threefold individual spirit had its being before
all Tribes and Races and it will remain when they have passed away and  even
the memory of them is no more.

   The threefold spirit in man,  the Ego, is the God within,  whom the  per-
sonal,  bodily man must learn to follow.  Therefore did Christ say that,  to
be His disciple,  a man must forsake all he had.  His teaching points to the
emancipation  of  the God within.   He calls upon man to exercise  his  pre-
rogative  as an individual and rise above family,  tribe,  and nation.   Not
that he is to disregard kin and country.  He must fulfill all duties, but he
is  to cease identifying himself with part and must recognize an equal  kin-
ship with ALL the world.  That is the ideal given to mankind by the Christ.

   Under the rule of the Race-spirit,  the nation,  tribe or family was con-
sidered first--the individual last.  The family must be kept intact.  If any


[PAGE 353]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

man dies without leaving offspring to perpetuate his name,  his brother must
"carry seed" to the widow, that there might be no dying out (Due. XXV:5-10).
Marrying  out of the family was regarded with horror in the earliest  times.
A member of one tribe could not become connected with another without losing
caste in his own.   It was not an easy matter to become a member of  another
family.   Not only among the Jews and other early nations was the  integrity
of the family insisted upon,  but also in more modern times.   As previously
mentioned,  the Scots, even in comparatively recent times, clung tenaciously
to  their  Clan,  and the old Norse Vikings would take  no  one  into  their
families without first "mixing blood" with him, for the spiritual effects of
haemolysis, which are unknown to material science, were known of old.

   All these customs resulted from the working of Race- and tribal-spirit in
the  common blood.   To admit as a member one in whom that common blood  did
not flow would have caused "confusion of caste."  The closer the inbreeding,
the  greater the power of the Race-spirit,  and the stronger the  ties  that
bound the individual to the tribe,  because the vital force of the man is in
his  blood.   Memory is intimately connected with the blood,  which  is  the
highest expression of the vital body.

   The brain and the nervous system are the highest expression of the desire
body.    They  call  up  pictures  of  the  outside  world,  but  in  mental
image-making,  i.e., imagination, the blood brings the material for the pic-
tures; therefore when the thought is active the blood flows to the head.

   When the same unmixed strain of blood flows in the veins of a family  for
generations,   the   same   mental   pictures   made  by  great-grandfather,


[PAGE 354]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

grandfather and father are reproduced in the son by the family-spirit  which
lived in the haemoglobin of the blood.   He sees himself as the continuation
of a long line of ancestors who LIVE IN HIM.   He sees all the events of the
past  lives of the family as though he had been present,  therefore he  does
not realize himself as an Ego.   He is not simply "David,:  but "the SON  of
Abraham"; not "Joseph," but "the SON of David."

   By  means of this common blood men are said to have LIVED for  many  gen-
erations,  because  through the blood their descendants had  access  to  the
memory of nature,  in which the records of the lives of their ancestors were
preserved.   That is why, in the fifth chapter of Genesis, it is stated that
the patriarchs lived for centuries.   Adam,  Methuselah and the other patri-
archs  did not PERSONALLY attain to such great age,  but they lived  in  the
consciousness of their descendants,  who saw the lives of their ancestors as
if THEY had lived them.  After the expiration of the period stated,  the de-
scendants  did  not think of themselves as Adam or  Methuselah.   Memory  of
those ancestors faded and so it is said they died.

   The "second sight"  of the Scotch Highlanders shows that be means of  en-
dogamy  the consciousness of the inner World is retained.   They have  prac-
ticed marrying in the Clan until recent times;  also in Gipsies,  who always
marry  in the tribe.   The smaller the tribe and the closer the  inbreeding,
the more pronounced is the "sight."

   The  earlier Races would not have dared to disobey the injunction  issued
by the tribal God,  not to marry outside of the tribe,  nor had they any in-
clination to do so, for they had no mind of their own.

   The Original Semites were the first to evolve Will, and they at once mar-
ried  the  daughters of the men of other tribes, frustrating temporarily the

design of their Race-spirit and being promptly ejected as evil-doers who had
"gone  a-whoring after strange gods," thereby rendering themselves unfit  to
give  the  "seed"  for  the seven Races of our  present  Aryan  Epoch.   The
Original  Semites  were,  for  the  time  being,  the  last  Race  that  the
Race-spirit cared to keep separate.

   Later, man was given free will.  The time had come when he was to be pre-
pared for individualization.  The former "common" consciousness,  the invol-
untary clairvoyance or second-sight which constantly held before a tribesman
the  pictures  of his ancestor's lives and caused him to feel  most  closely
identified  with  the tribe or family,  was to be replaced for a time  by  a
strictly individual consciousness confined to the material world,  so as  to
break  up the nations into individuals, that the Brotherhood of Man  regard-
less of exterior circumstances may become a fact.  This is on the same prin-
ciple  that if we have a number of buildings and wish to make them into  one
large  structure,  it is necessary to break them up  into  separate  bricks.
Only then can the large building be constructed.

   In order to accomplish this separation of nations into individuals,  laws
were  given which prohibited endogamy or marriage in the family  and  hence-
forth  incestuous  marriages  gradually came to  be  regarded  with  horror.
Strange  blood has thus been introduced into all the families of  the  Earth
and  it has gradually wiped out the involuntary clairvoyance which  promoted
the clannish feeling and segregated humanity into groups.   Altruism is  su-
perseding  patriotism,  and loyalty to the family is disappearing in  conse-
quence of the mixture of blood.

   Science   has   lately   discovered   that   haemolysis  results from the


[PAGE 356]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

inoculation  of the blood of one individual into the veins of another  of  a
different  species,  causing the death of the lower of the  two.   Thus  any
animal inoculated with the blood of a man dies.   The blood of a dog  trans-
fused into the veins of a bird kills the bird,  but it will not hurt the dog
to have the bird's blood inoculated into its veins.   Science merely  states
the fact,  the occult scientist gives the reason.   The blood is the vantage
ground of the spirit,  as shown elsewhere.   The Ego in man works in its own
vehicles by means of the HEAT of the blood;  the race,  family or  community
spirit gains entrance to the blood by means of the AIR we inspire.   In  the
animals are also both the separate spirit of the animal and the group-spirit
of the species to which it belongs,  but the spirit of the animal is not in-
dividualized  and does not work self-consciously with its vehicles  as  does
the Ego, hence it is altogether dominated by the group-spirit which works in
the blood.

   When  the  blood of a higher animal is inoculated into the veins  of  one
from  a lower species,  the spirit in the blood of the higher animal  is  of
course stronger than the spirit of the less evolved; hence when it endeavors
to assert itself it kills the imprisoning  form and liberates itself.  When,
on the other hand, the blood of a lower species is inoculated into the veins
of a higher animal, the higher spirit is capable of ousting the less evolved
spirit in the strange blood and assimilating the blood to its own  purposes,
therefore no visible catastrophe ensues.

   The  group-spirit always aims to preserve the integrity of its domain  in
the blood of the species under its charge.  Like the human Race-God,  it re-
sents the marriage of its subjects into other species and visits the sins of
the  fathers  upon the children as we see in the case of hybrids.   Where  a
horse and a donkey produce a mule for instance, the mixture of strange blood


[PAGE 357]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

destroys the propagative faculty so as not to perpetuate the hybrid which is
an abomination from the standpoint of the group-spirit,  for the mule is not
so definitely under the dominion of the group-spirit of the horses or of the
group-spirit of the donkeys as the pure breed, yet it is not so far away  as
to be entirely exempt from their influence.  If two mules could mate,  their
offspring  would  be  still  less under the  dominion  of  either  of  these
group-spirits,  and  so a new species WITHOUT A GROUP-SPIRIT  would  result.
That  would  be  anomaly in nature,  an  impossibility  until  the  separate
animal-spirits    should   have   become   sufficiently   evolved   to    be
SELF-SUFFICIENT.  Such a species, could it be produced, would be without the
guiding  instinct,  so-called,  which is in reality the  promptings  of  the
group-spirit;  they would be in an analogous position to a litter of kittens
removed  from  the mother's womb prior to birth.   They could  not  possibly
shift for themselves, so they would die.

   Therefore,  as  it  is the group-spirit of the  animals  that  sends  the
separate  spirits of the animals into embodiment,  it simply  withholds  the
fertilizing  seed-atom when animals of widely differing species  are  mated.
It  permits  one  of its charges to take advantage  of  an  opportunity  for
re-embodiment where two animals of nearly the same nature are mated, but re-
fuses to let the hybrids perpetuate themselves.   Thus we see that the infu-
sion  of strange blood weakens the hold of the group-spirit and that  there-
fore it either destroys the FORM or the propagative FACULTY where it has the
power.

   The human spirit is individualized, an Ego, it is evolving free will  and
responsibility.   It  is drawn to birth by the irresistible  law  of  Conse-
quence,  so  that it is beyond the power of the race,  community  or  family
spirit to keep it from returning at the present stage of  human development,


[PAGE 358]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

and by the admixture of strange blood,  by intermarriage of the  individuals
of different tribes or nations, the leaders of man are gradually helping him
to oust the family,  tribal or national spirit from the blood,  but with  it
has necessarily gone the involuntary clairvoyance which was due to its work-
ing in the blood,  whereby it fostered the family traditions in its charges,
and  so we see that ALSO IN THE CASE OF MAN A FACULTY WAS DESTROYED  BY  THE
MIXTURE OF BLOOD.   That loss was a gain,  however,  for it has concentrated
man's energy on the material world and he is better able to master its  les-
sons that if he were still distracted by the visions of the higher realms.

   As  man  becomes emancipated he gradually ceases to think of  himself  as
"Abraham's Seed," as a "Clan Stewart Man," as a "Brahmin" or a "Levite":  he
is learning to think more of himself as an individual an "I".   The more  he
cultivates  that "Self,"  the more he frees himself from the family and  na-
tional spirit in the blood,  the more he becomes self-sufficient citizen  of
the world.

   There is much foolish,  even dangerous, take of giving up the Self to the
Not-Self;  only when we have cultivated a "Self," can we sacrifice ourselves
and give up the SELF to the WHOLE.  So long as we can only love our own fam-
ily or nation we are incapable of loving others.  We are bound by the tie of
kin and country.  When we have burst the tie of blood and ASSERTED OURSELVES
and  become  self-sufficient may we become unselfish  helpers  of  humanity.
When a man has reached that stage he will find that,  instead of having lost
his own family,  he has gained all the families in the world,  for they will
have  become his sisters and brothers,  his fathers and mothers to care  for
and help.

   Then he will regain the viewpoint of the Spiritual World which he lost by


[PAGE 359]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

the mixing of blood, but it will be a higher faculty an intelligent,  volun-
tary clairvoyance where he can see what HE wills and not merely the negative
faculty  imprinted in his blood by the family spirit which bound him to  the
family to the exclusion of all other families.   His viewpoint will be  uni-
versal, to be used for universal good.

   For  aforementioned reasons,  intertribal, and later international,  mar-
riages  came gradually to be regarded as desirable and preferable  to  close
intermarriages.

   As man progressed through these stages, and gradually lost touch with the
inner world,  he sorrowed over the loss and longer for a return of the  "in-
ner"  vision.   But by degrees he forgot,  and the material world  gradually
loomed up before his mind as the only reality,  until at last he has come to
scout  the idea that such inner Worlds exist and to regard a belief in  them
as foolish superstition.

   The four causes contributing to this condition were:

   (1)  The clearing of the foggy atmosphere of the Atlantean continent.

   (2)  The indrawing of the vital body,  so that a point at the root of the
nose corresponds to a similar point in the vital body.

   (3)  The elimination of inbreeding and the substitution therefore of mar-
riages outside the family and tribe.

   (4)  The use of intoxicants.

   The Race-spirits still exist in and work with man,  but the more advanced
nation, the more freedom is given the individual.  In countries where people
are most fettered,  the Race-spirit is strongest.  The more in harmony a man
is with the law of Love,  and the higher his ideals,  the more he frees him-
self from the spirit of the Races.   Patriotism,  while good in itself, is a


[PAGE 360]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

tie of the Race-spirit.   The ideal of Universal Brotherhood,  which identi-
fies  itself with neither country nor race, is the only path which leads  to
emancipation.

   Christ  came  to reunite the separated races in bonds of peace  and  good
will, wherein all will willingly and CONSCIOUSLY follow the law of Love.

    The  present Christianity is not even a shadow of the true  religion  of
Christ.  That will remain in abeyance until all race feeling shall have been
overcome.   In the Sixth Epoch there will be but one Universal  Brotherhood,
under the Leadership of the RETURNED Christ, but the day and the hour no man
knows, for it is not fixed, but depends upon how soon a sufficient number of
people  shall have commenced to live the life of Fellowship and Love,  which
is to be the hall-mark of the new dispensation.

                               THE FALL OF MAN

   In connection with the analysis of Genesis, a few more words must be said
about "The Fall,"  which is the backbone and sinew of popular  Christianity.
Had  there been no "Fall,"  there would have been no need for the  "plan  of
salvation."

   When,  in the middle of the Lemurian Epoch,  the separation of the  sexes
occurred (in which work Jehovah and His Angels were active),  the Ego  began
to work slightly upon the dense body,  building organs within.   Man was not
at that time the wide-awake conscious being he is at present,  but by  means
of half the sex force, he was building a brain for the expression of thought
as previously described.   He was more awake in the Spiritual World than  in
the  physical;  hardly  saw his body and was not conscious  if  the  act  of
propagation.   The Bible statement that Jehovah put man to sleep when he was
to  bring  forth  is  correct.  There was no pain nor trouble connected with


[PAGE 361]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

childbirth;  nor  (because  of man's exceedingly dim  consciousness  of  his
physical surroundings) did he know anything of the loss of his dense body by
death, or of his installment in a new dense vehicle at birth.

   It  will be remembered that the Lucifers were a part of the  humanity  of
the Moon Period; they are the stragglers of the life wave of the Angels, too
far advanced to take a dense physical body, yet they needed an "inner" organ
for  the  acquisition of knowledge.   Moreover,  they could work  through  a
physical brain, which the Angels or Jehovah could not.

   These  spirits entered the spinal cord and brain and spoke to the  woman,
whose Imagination,  as explained elsewhere, had been aroused by the training
of  the  Lemurian Race.   As her consciousness was principally  internal,  a
picture-consciousness of them was received by her,  and she saw them as ser-
pents, for they had entered her brain by the serpentine spinal cord.

   The training of the woman included watching the perilous feats and fights
of the Men in developing Will, in which fights bodies were necessarily often
killed.   The dim consciousness of something unusual set the imagination  of
the woman to wondering why she saw these strange things.   She was conscious
of the spirits of those who had lost their bodies,  but her imperfect  sense
of the Physical World failed to reveal these friends whose dense bodies  had
been destroyed.

   The Lucifers solved the problem for her by "opening her eyes."   They re-
vealed to her her own body and that of the man and taught her how, together,
they might conquer death by creating new bodies.  Thus death could not touch
them for they, like Jehovah, could create at will.


[PAGE 362]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Lucifer opened the eyes of woman,   She sought the help of man and opened
his eyes.  Thus, in a real though dim way, they first "knew" or became aware
of  one another and also of the Physical World.   They became  conscious  of
death  and pain and by this knowledge they learned to differentiate  between
the inner man and the outer garment he wears and renews each time it is nec-
essary to take his next step in evolution.  They ceased to be automatons and
became free thinking beings at the cost of freedom from pain,  sickness  and
death.

   That  the  interpretation of the eating of the fruit as a symbol  of  the
generative act is not a far-fetched idea, is shown by the declaration of Je-
hovah  (which is not a curse at all,  but simply a statement of  the  conse-
quences  that  would follow the act) that they will die and that  the  woman
will bear her children in pain and suffering.  He knew that, as man's atten-
tion had now been called to his physical garment,  he would become aware  of
its loss by death.   He also knew that man had not yet wisdom to bridle  his
passion  and  regulate sexual intercourse by the positions of  the  planets,
therefore pain in childbirth must follow his ignorant abuse of the function.

   It  has always been a sore puzzle to Bible commentators  what  connection
there could possibly be between the eating of fruit and the bearing of chil-
dren, but if we understand that the eating of the fruit is symbolical of the
generative act whereby man becomes "like God"  inasmuch as he KNOWS his kind
and is thus able to generate new beings, the solution is easy.

   In  the latter part of the Lemurian Epoch when man arrogated  to  himself
the prerogative of performing the generative act when he pleased, it was his
then-powerful  will  that  enable  him  to do so.  By "eating of the tree of


[PAGE 363]                                        OCCULT ANALYSIS OF GENESIS

knowledge" at any and all times he was able to create a new body whenever he
lost an old vehicle.

   We  usually  think  of death as something to be dreaded.   Had  man  also
"eaten of the tree of life," had he learned the secret of how to perpetually
vitalize his body,  there would have been a worse condition.   We know  that
our bodies are not perfect today and in those ancient days they were exceed-
ingly primitive.  Therefore the anxiety of the creative Hierarchies lest man
"eat  of  the tree of life also," and become capable of renewing  his  vital
body,  was well founded.  Had he done so he would have been immortal indeed,
but  would never have been able to progress.   The evolution of the Ego  de-
pends  upon its vehicles and if it could not get new and improving  ones  by
death and birth,  there would be stagnation.  It is an occult maxim that the
oftener  we die the better we are able to live,  for every birth gives us  a
new chance.

   We have seen that brain-knowledge, with its concomitant selfishness,  was
brought  by man at the cost of the power to create from himself  alone.   He
bought his free will at the cost of pain and death;  but when man learns  to
use  his intellect for the good of humanity,  he will gain  spiritual  power
over  life and in addition,  will be guided by an innate knowledge  as  much
higher than the present brain-consciousness as that is higher than the  low-
est animal consciousness.

   The fall into generation was necessary to build the brain,  but that  is,
at best, only an indirect way of gaining knowledge and will be superseded by
direct touch with the Wisdom of Nature, which man, without any co-operation,
will then be able to use for the generation of new bodies.   The larnyx will
again speak "the lost Word," the "creative Fiat," which,  under the guidance
of great Teachers, was used in ancient Lemuria in the creation of plants and
animals.


[PAGE 364]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Man will then be a creator in very truth.   Not in the slow and  toilsome
manner of the present day, but by the use of the proper word or magical for-
mula, will he be able to create a body.

   All  that was manifested during the descending period of  involution  re-
mains  until the corresponding point on the ascending are of  evolution  has
been  reached.   The present generative organs will degenerate and  atrophy.
The  female  organ was the first to come into existence as a  separate  unit
and,  according to the law that "the first shall be last,"  will be the last
to atrophy.  The male organ was differentiated last and is even now commenc-
ing to divide itself from the body.  Diagram 13 will make this clear.

                           CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

                          THE EVOLUTION OF RELIGION

   In  the foregoing part of this work we have become familiar with the  way
in which our present outside world came into existence,  and how man evolved
the  complicated organism with which he is related to outer conditions.   We
have also,  in a measure,  studies the Jewish Race-religion.   We will  next
consider the last and greatest of the divine measures put forth for the  up-
lifting of humanity,  i.e.,  Christianity, which will be the Universal Reli-
gion of the future.

   It is a notable fact that man and his religions have evolved side by side
and in an equal degree.  The earliest religion of any Race is found to be as
savage as the people governed by it and as they become more civilized, their
religions become more and more humane and in harmony with higher ideals.

   From this fact materialists have drawn the inference that no religion has
a  higher origin than man itself.   Their investigations into early  history
have resulted in a conviction that, as man progressed,  he civilized his God
and fashioned Him after his own pattern.

   This reasoning is defective,  because it fails to take into account  that
man is NOT the body, but an INDWELLING spirit, an Ego who uses the body with
ever-increasing facility as evolution progresses.


[PAGE 368]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   There is no doubt that the law for the BODY is "The Survival of the  Fit-
test."   The  law for the evolution of the spirit demands  "Sacrifice."   As
long  as  man believes that "Might is Right,"  the Form prospers  and  waxes
strong, because all obstacles are swept out of the way regardless of others.
If the body were all, that manner of life would be the only one possible for
man.   He would be altogether incapable of any regard for others  and  would
forcibly  resist  any  attempt  to encroach  upon  what  he  considered  his
rights--the right of the stronger, which is the sole standard of justice un-
der the law of the Survival of the Fittest.  He would be quite regardless of
his  fellow  beings;  absolutely insensible to any force FROM  WITHOUT  that
tended  to  make him act in any manner not conducive to  his  own  momentary
pleasure.

   It is manifest, then, that whatever urges man toward a higher standard of
conduct in his dealing with others must come FROM WITHIN,  and from a source
which is not identical with the body, otherwise it would not strive with the
body  and  often prevail against its most obvious interests.   Moreover,  it
must be a stronger force than that of the body,  or it could not succeed  in
overcoming  its desires and compelling it to make sacrifices for  those  who
are physically weaker.

   That such a force exists, surely no one will deny.   We have come to that
stage  in our advancement where,  instead of seeing in physical weakness  an
opportunity  for easy prey,  we recognize in the very frailty of  another  a
valid  claim upon our protection.   Selfishness is being slowly  but  surely
routed by Altruism.

   Nature is sure to accomplish her purposes.  Though slow,  her progress is
orderly  and  certain.  In  the  breast  of every man this force of Altruism


[PAGE 369]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

works  as a leaven.   It is transforming the savage into the civilized  man,
and will in time transform the latter into a God.

   Though  nothing that is truly spiritual can be  thoroughly  comprehended,
yet it may at least be apprehended by means of an illustration.

   If one or two tuning-forks of exactly the same pitch is struck, the sound
will induce the same vibration in the other, weak to begin with,  but if the
strokes  are continued,  the second fork will give out a louder  and  louder
tone until it will emit a volume of sound equal to that of the first.   This
will happen though the forks are several feet apart, and even if one of them
is  encased  in glass.   The sound from the smitten one will  penetrate  the
glass and the answering note be emitted by the enclosed instrument.

   These  invisible sound-vibrations have great power over concrete  matter.
They can both build and destroy.  If a small quantity of very fine powder is
placed upon a brass or glass plate,  and a violin bow drawn across the edge,
the  vibrations will cause the powder to assume beautiful  geometrical  fig-
ures.   The human voice is also capable of producing these  figures;  always
the same figure for the same tone.

   If   one  note  or  chord  after  another  be  sounded  upon  a   musical
instrument--a piano,  or preferably a violin, for from it more gradations of
tone  can be obtained--a tone will finally be reached which will causes  the
hearer  to  feel a distinct vibration in the back of the lower part  of  the
head.  Each time that note is struck, the vibration will be felt.  That note
is the "key-note"  of the person whom it so affects.  If it is struck slowly
and soothingly it will build and rest the body,  tone the nerves and restore
health.  If,  on  the  other hand, it be sounded in a dominant way, loud and


[PAGE 370]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

long enough, it will kill as surely as a bullet from a pistol.

   If we now apply what has been said about music or sound to the problem of
how this inner force is awakened and strengthened, we may perhaps understand
the matter better.

   In  the  first  place,  let us particularly note the fact  that  the  two
tuning-forks were OF THE SAME PITCH.   Had this not been the case,  we might
have sounded and sounded one of them until the crack of doom,  but the other
one would have remained mute.  Let us understand this thoroughly:  Vibration
can be induced in one tuning-fork by one of LIKE TONE ONLY.   Any thing,  or
any  being,  can  be affected as above stated by no  sound  except  ITS  OWN
KEY-NOTE.

   We know that this force of Altruism exists.  We also know that it is less
pronounced  among uncivilized people than among people of higher social  at-
tainment,  and  among the very lowest races it is almost  entirely  lacking.
The  logical conclusion is that there was a time when it was altogether  ab-
sent.   Consequent upon this conclusion follows the natural question:   What
induced it?

   The material personality surely had nothing to do with it; in fact,  that
part  of man's nature was much more comfortable without it than it has  been
at any time since.   Man must have had the force of Altruism latent  WITHIN,
otherwise it could not have been awakened.  Still further, it must have been
awakened  by  a  force of the same kind--a similar force  that  was  already
active--as  the second tuning-fork was started into vibration by  the  first
AFTER it was struck.

   We  also saw that the vibrations in the second fork become  stronger  and
stronger  under  the  continued  impacts of sound from the first, and that a


[PAGE 371]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

glass case was no hindrance to the induction of the sound.   Under the  con-
tinued impacts of a force similar to that within him, the Love of God to man
has  awakened  this force of Altruism and is constantly increasing  its  po-
tency.

   It is therefore reasonable and logical to conclude that, at first, it was
necessary to give man a religion commensurate with his ignorance.   It would
have been useless to talk to him,  at that stage,  of a God Who was all ten-
derness and love.   From his viewpoint, those attributes were weaknesses and
he  could not have been expected to reverence a God Who possessed what  were
to him despicable qualities.   The God to Whom he rendered obedience must be
a strong God,  a God to be feared, a God Who could hurl the thunderbolt  and
wield the flail of lightning.

   Thus, man was impelled first to FEAR God and was given religions of a na-
ture to further his spiritual well-being under the lash of fear.

   The next step was to induce him a certain kind of unselfishness, by caus-
ing  him  to  give up part of his worldly  goods--to  sacrifice.   This  was
achieved by giving him the Tribal or Race-God, Who is a jealous God, requir-
ing of him the strictest allegiance and the sacrifice of wealth,  which  the
growing man greatly prizes.   But in return,  this Race-God is a friend  and
mighty ally, fighting man's battles and giving him back many fold the sheep,
bullocks and grain which he sacrificed.  He had not yet arrived at the stage
where it was possible for him to understand that all creatures are akin, but
the  Tribal  God taught him that he must deal mercifully  with  his  BROTHER
TRIBESMAN  and gave laws which made for equity and fair dealing between  men
of the same Race.

   It must not be thought that these successive steps were taken easily, nor
without rebellion and lapses upon the part of primitive man.  Selfishness is


[PAGE 372]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

ingrained in the lower nature even unto this day,  and there must have  been
many lapses and much backsliding.  We have in the Jewish Bible good examples
of how man forgot, and had to be patiently and persistently "prodded"  again
and  again  by  the Tribal God.  Only the visitations  of  a  long-suffering
Race-spirit were potent, at times, in bringing him back to the law--that law
very few people have even yet learned to obey.

   There are always pioneers,  however, who require something higher.   When
they become sufficiently numerous, a new step in evolution is taken, so that
several  gradations always exist.   There came a time,  nearly two  thousand
years  ago,  when the most advanced of humanity were ready to  take  another
step forward,  and learn the religion of living a good life for the sake  of
future reward in a state if existence in which they must have faith.

   That was a long,  hard step to take.  It was comparatively easy to take a
sheep  or  a bullock to the temple and offer it as a sacrifice.   If  a  man
brought  the first-fruits of his granary, his vineyards,  or his flocks  and
herds,  he still had more,  and he knew that the Tribal God would refill his
stores and give abundantly in return.  But in this new departure, it was not
a question of sacrificing his goods.  It was demanded that he sacrifice HIM-
SELF.   It was not even a sacrifice to be made by one supreme effort of mar-
tyrdom;  that also would have been comparatively easy.  Instead,  it was de-
manded  that day by day,  from morning until night,  he must act  mercifully
toward all.   He must forego selfishness,  and LOVE his neighbor,  as he had
been  used to loving himself.   Moreover, he was not promised any  immediate
and visible reward, but must have faith in a future happiness.


[PAGE 373]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

   Is it strange that people find it difficult to realize this high ideal of
CONTINUED well-doing, made doubly hard by the fact that self-interest is en-
tirely ignored?  Sacrifice is demanded with no positive assurance of ANY re-
ward.   Surely it is much to the credit of humanity that so much altruism is
practiced and that it is constantly increasing.   The wise Leaders,  knowing
the frailness of the spirit to cope with the selfish instincts of the  body,
and  the  dangers of despondency in the face of such standards  of  conduct,
gave  another uplifting impulse when they incorporated in the  new  religion
the doctrine of "vicarious Atonement."

   This idea is scouted by some very advanced philosophers,  and the law  of
"Consequence"  made paramount.  If it so happens that the reader agrees with
these  philosophers,  we request that he await the  explanation  herein  set
forth, showing how BOTH are part of the scheme of upliftment.  Suffice it to
say,  for the present, that this doctrine of atonement gives many an earnest
soul the strength to strive and, in spite or repeated failures, to bring the
lower nature under subjection.  Let it be remembered that, for reasons given
when  the laws of Rebirth and Consequence were discussed,  western  humanity
knew practically nothing of these laws.  With such a great ideal before them
as  the  Christ,  and believing they had but a few short years in  which  to
attain to such a high degree of development as this,  would it not have been
the greatest imaginable cruelty to leave them without help?  Therefore,  the
GREAT SACRIFICE on Calvary--while it also served other purposes,  as will be
shown--become  rightfully the Beacon of Hope for every earnest soul  who  is
striving to achieve the impossible;  to attain,  in one short life,  to  the
perfection demanded by the Christian religion.

                           JESUS AND CHRIST-JESUS.

   To  gain some slight insight into the Great Mystery of Golgotha,  and  to
understand the Mission of Christ as the Founder of the Universal Religion of
the future, it is necessary that we first become familiar with His exact na-
ture  and  incidentally,  with that of Jehovah,  Who is  the  head  of  such
Race-religions as Taoism,  Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, etc.;  also with the
identity of "The Father,"  to Whom Christ is to give up the Kingdom,  in due
time.

   In the Christian creed occurs this sentence:  "Jesus Christ, the only be-
gotten  Son of God."   This is generally understood to mean that  a  certain
person Who appeared in Palestine about 2,000 years ago,  Who is spoken of as
Jesus Christ--one separate individual--was the only begotten Son of God.

   This is a great mistake.   There are three distinct and widely  different
Beings  characterized in this sentence.   It is of the  greatest  importance
that  the student should clearly understand the exact nature of these  Three
Great  and Exalted Beings--differing vastly in glory,  yet each entitled  to
our deepest and most devout adoration.

   The student is requested to turn to diagram 6 and note that "The only be-
gotten" ("The Word," of Who John speaks) is the second aspect of the Supreme
Being.

   This "Word"  and It alone,  is "begotten of His Father (the first appear)
before all Worlds."  "Without Him was not anything made that was made,"  not
even the third aspect of the Supreme Being, which proceeds from the two pre-
vious  aspects.   Therefore the "only begotten"  is the exalted Being  which
ranks above all else in the Universe,  save only the Power-aspect which cre-
ated It.

   The first aspect of the Supreme Being "thinks out," of imagines, the Uni-
verse  before the beginning of active manifestation,  everything,  including


[PAGE 375]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

the  millions of Solar Systems and the great creative Hierarchies which  in-
habit the Cosmic Planes of existence above the seventh,  which is the  field
of  our evolution (See diagram 6).   This is also the Force which  dissolves
everything  that has crystallized beyond the possibility of  further  growth
and at last, when the end of active manifestation has come, reabsorbs within
Itself all that is, until the dawn of another Period of Manifestation.

   The second aspect of the Supreme Being is that which manifests in  matter
as the forces of attraction and cohesion,  thus giving it the capability  of
combining  into Forms of various kinds.  This is "The Word,"  the  "creative
Feat,"  which molds the primordial Cosmic Root-substance in a manner similar
to the formation of figures by musical vibrations,  as previously mentioned,
the  same tone always producing the same figure.   So this great  primordial
"WORD'  brought, or "spoke," into being, in finest matter, all the different
Worlds,  with all their myriads of Forms,  which have since been copied  and
worked out in detail by the innumerable creative Hierarchies.

   "The Word"  could not have done this, however,  until the third aspect of
the Supreme Being had first prepared the Cosmic Root-substance; had awakened
it  from its normal state of inertia and set the countless INSEPARATE  atoms
spinning upon their axes,  placing those axes at various angles with respect
to each other, giving to each kind a certain "measure of vibration."

   These  varying angles of inclination of the axes and the measures of  vi-
bration made the Cosmic Root-substance capable of forming different combina-
tions,  which are the basis of the seven great Cosmic Planes.  There is,  in
each  of  these  Planes,  a  different  inclination  of the axes, and also a


[PAGE 376]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

different measure of vibration, consequently the conditions and combinations
in each one are different from those in any of the others, due to the activ-
ity of "The Only Begotten."

   Diagram 14 shows us that:

   "The Father" is the highest Initiate among the humanity of the Saturn
         Period.  The ordinary humanity of that Period are now the Lords of
         Mind.
   "The Son" (Christ) is the highest Initiate of the Sun Period.  The
         ordinary humanity of that Period are now the Archangels.
   "The Holy Spirit" (Jehovah) is the highest Initiate of the Moon
         Period.  The ordinary humanity of that Period are now the Angels.

   This  diagram also shows what are the vehicles of these different  orders
of Beings,  and upon comparison with diagram 8,  it will be seen that  their
bodies  or vehicles (indicated by squares on diagram 14) correspond  to  the
Globes of the Period in which they were human.   This is always the case  so
far  as the ordinary humanities are concerned, for at the end of the  Period
during which any live wave becomes individualized as human beings, those be-
ings  retain  BODIES corresponding to the Globes on which  they  have  func-
tioned.

   On  the other hand,  the Initiates have progressed and evolved for  them-
selves higher vehicles, discontinuing the ordinary use of the lowest vehicle
when the ability to use a new and higher one has been attained.  Ordinarily,
the lowest vehicle of an Archangel is the desire body,  but Christ,  Who  is
the highest Initiate of the Sun Period,  ordinarily uses the life spirit  as
lowest vehicle, functioning as consciously in the World of Life Spirit as we
do  in  the  Physical  World.  The  student  is requested to note this point


[PAGE 377]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

       THE VEHICLES OF THE HIGHEST INITIATES AND ORDINARY HUMANITY



[PAGE 378]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

particularly,  as the World of Life Spirit is the first UNIVERSAL World,  as
explained   in   the  chapter  on  Worlds.   It  is  the  World   in   which
differentiation ceases and unity begins to be realized,  so far as out solar
system is concerned.

   Christ has power to build and function in a vehicle as low as the  desire
body, such as is used by the Archangels but HE CAN DESCEND NO FURTHER.   The
significance of this will be seen presently.

   JESUS belongs to our humanity.   When the man,  Jesus is studied  through
the memory of nature, he can be traced back life by life,  where he lived in
different circumstances, under various names, in different embodiments,  the
same time,  in that respect, as any other human being.   THIS CANNOT BE DONE
WITH THE BEING, CHRIST.  In His CASE CAN BE FOUND BUT ONE EMBODIMENT.

   It must not be supposed,  however, that Jesus was an ordinary individual.
He was of a singularly pure type of mind,  vastly superior to the great  ma-
jority of our present humanity.   Through many lives had he trod the Path of
Holiness and thus fitted himself for the greatest honor ever bestowed upon a
human being.

   His mother,  Virgin Mary, was also a type of the highest human purity and
because of that was selected to become the mother of Jesus.   His father was
a high Initiate,  virgin and capable of performing the act of fecundation as
a sacrament, without personal desire or passion.

   Thus  the  beautiful,  pure and lovely spirit whom we know  as  Jesus  of
Nazareth was born into a pure and passionless body.   This body was the best
that could be produced on Earth and the task of Jesus,  in that  embodiment,
was  to  care  for  it  and  evolve  it  to  the  highest possible degree of


[PAGE 379]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION


efficiency, in preparation for the great purpose it was to serve.

   Jesus  of  Nazareth  was born at about the time stated  in  the  historic
records,  and not 105 B.C., as stated in some occult works.   The name Jesus
is common in the East, and an Initiate named Jesus did live 105 B.C., but he
took the Egyptian Initiation and was not Jesus of Nazareth, with whom we are
concerned.

   The Individual who was later born under the name of Christian Rosenkreuz,
who is in the body today,  was a highly evolved being when Jesus of Nazareth
was born.  His testimony, as well as the results of first-hand investigation
by later Rosicrucians,  all agree in placing the birth of Jesus of  Nazareth
at the beginning of the Christian Era, on about the date usually ascribed to
that event.

   Jesus  was  educated  by the Essenes and reached a  very  high  state  of
spiritual development during the thirty years in which he used his body.

   It may be here said,  parenthetically, that the Essenes were a third sect
which  existed  in  Palestine,   besides  the  two  mentioned  in  the   New
Testament--the Pharisees and the Sadducees.  The Essenes were an exceedingly
devout order, widely different from the materialistic Sadducees and entirely
opposite to the hypocritical, publicity seeking Pharisees.  They shunned all
mention of themselves and their methods of study and worship.  To the latter
peculiarity is due the fact that almost nothing is known of them,  and  that
they are not mentioned in the New Testament.

   It is a law of the Cosmos that no Being,  however high,  can function  in
any  world  without  a  vehicle built of the material  of  that  world  (See
diagrams 8 and 14).  Therefore the desire body was the lowest vehicle of the


[PAGE 380]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

group of spirits who had reached the human stage in the Sun Period.

   Christ was one of those spirits and was consequently unable to build  for
Himself  a vital body and a dense physical vehicle.   He could  have  worked
upon humanity in a desire body, as did His younger brothers, the Archangels,
as Race-spirits.   Jehovah had opened an avenue for them to enter the  dense
body of man by means of the air he inhaled.   All Race-religions were  reli-
gions  of law,  and creators of sin through disobedience of that law.   They
were  under  the  direction of Jehovah, Whose lowest vehicle  is  the  human
spirit,  correlating Him to the World of Abstract Thought,  where everything
is separative and therefore leads to self-seeking.

   That is precisely the reason why the intervention of Christ became neces-
sary.   Under  the  REGIME of Jehovah unity is  impossible.   Therefore  the
Christ, Who possess as a lowest vehicle the unifying life spirit, must enter
into the dense human body.   He must appear as a man among men and dwell  in
this  body,  because  only  from  WITHIN  IS  IT  possible  to  conquer  the
Race-religion, which influences man from WITHOUT.

   Christ  could not be BORN in a dense body,  because He had  never  passed
through an evolution such as the Earth Period, therefore He would first have
had to acquire the ability to build a dense body such as ours.  But even had
He  possessed that ability,  it would have been inexpedient for such an  ex-
alted   Being  to  expend  for  that  purpose  the  energy   necessary   for
body-building through ante-natal life,  childhood and youth,  to bring it to
sufficient  maturity for use.   He had ceased to use,  ordinarily,  vehicles
such as would correspond to our human spirit, mind and desire body, although
He had learned to build them in the Sun Period,  and retained the ability to


[PAGE 381]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

build  and function in them whenever desired or required.   He used all  his
own vehicles,  taking only the vital and dense bodies from Jesus.   When the
latter  was 30 years of age Christ entered these bodies and used them  until
the climax of His Mission on Golgotha.   After the destruction of the  dense
body,  Christ appeared among His disciples in the vital body,  in  which  He
functioned for some time.   The vital body is the vehicle which He will  use
when He appears again, for He will never take another dense body.

   It  is encroaching upon a subject to be dealt with later to  remark  that
the object of all esoteric training is to so work on the vital body that the
life spirit is built up and quickened.  When we come to deal with Initiation
it  may be possible to give more detailed explanations,  but no more can  be
said  on the subject just now.   In chronicling the events incident to  POST
MORTEM existence, this subject has been partially dealt with and the student
is  here asked to note that a man is supposed to have conquered  his  desire
body to a considerable extent before attempting esotericism.   His  esoteric
training  and the earlier Initiations are devoted to work on the vital  body
and result in the building of the life spirit.   At the time Christ  entered
the  body of Jesus,  the latter was a disciple of high degree,  consequently
his life spirit was well organized.  Therefore,  the lowest vehicle in which
Christ functioned,  and the best organized of the higher vehicles of  Jesus,
were identical;  and Christ,  when He took the vital body and the dense body
of Jesus,  was thus furnished with a complete chain of vehicles bridging the
gap between the World of Life Spirit and the dense Physical World.

   The  significance of the fact that Jesus had passed  several  initiations
lies  in  the  effect  that  has  on  the vital body.  Jesus' vital body was


[PAGE 382]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

already  attuned  to the high vibrations of the life  spirit.   An  ordinary
man's  vital body would have instantly collapsed under the  terrific  vibra-
tions of the Great Spirit who entered Jesus' body.  Even that body, pure and
high-strung as it was, could not withstand those tremendous impacts for many
years,  and when we read of certain times when Christ  withdrew  temporarily
from  his disciples,  as when he later walked on the sea to meet  them,  the
esotericist  knows that he drew out of Jesus'  vehicles to give them a  rest
under  the care of the Essene Brothers,  who knew more of how to treat  such
vehicles than Christ did.

   This change was consummated with the full and free consent of Jesus,  who
knew during this entire life that he was preparing a vehicle for Christ.  He
submitted gladly, that his brother humanity might receive the gigantic impe-
tus  which  was  given to its development by  the  mysterious  sacrifice  on
Golgotha.

   Thus (as shown in diagram 14) Christ Jesus possessed the twelve vehicles,
which formed an unbroken chain from the Physical World to the very Throne of
God.   Therefore He is the only Being in the Universe in touch with both God
and  man and capable of mediating between them,  because He has,  personally
and individually experience all conditions and knows every limitation  inci-
dental to physical existence.

   Christ is unique among all Beings in all the seven Worlds.  He alone pos-
sess the twelve vehicles.  None save He is able to feel such compassion, nor
so  fully  understand the position and needs of humanity;  none save  He  is
qualified to bring the relive that shall fully meet our needs.


[PAGE 383]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

   Thus do we know the nature of Christ.   He is the highest Initiate of the
Sun  Period  and He tool the dense and vital bodies of Jesus that  He  might
function directly in the Physical World and appear as a man among men.   Had
He appeared in a manifestly miraculous manner,  it would have been  contrary
to the scheme of evolution, because at the end of the Atlantean Epoch human-
ity had been given freedom to do right or wrong.   That they might learn  to
become self-governing,  no coercion whatever could be used.   They must know
good  and  evil  through experience.   Before that time they  had  been  led
willy-nilly,  but at that time they were given freedom under  the  different
Race-religions,  each religion adapted to the needs of its particular  Tribe
or Nation.

                            NOT PEACE BUT A SWORD

   All  Race-religions are of the Holy Spirit.   They are insufficient,  be-
cause they are based on law, which makes for sin and brings death,  pain and
sorrow.

   All Race-spirits know this,  and realize that their religions are  merely
steps   to  something  better.    This  is  shown  by  the  fact  that   all
Race-religions,  without exception, point to One Who is TO COME.   The reli-
gion  of the Persians pointed to Mithras;  of the Chaldeans to Tammuz.   The
old  Norse  Gods foresaw the approach of "The Twilight of  the  Gods,"  when
Sutr, the bright Sun-spirit, shall supersede them and a new and fairer order
be established on "Gimle," the regenerated earth.   The Egyptians waited for
Horis,  the new-born Sun.   Mithras and Tammuz are also symbolized as  Solar
orbs and all the principal Temples were built facing the East, that the rays
of  the rising Sun might shine directly through the open doors;  even  Saint
Peter's  at  Rome  is so placed.  All these facts show that it was generally


[PAGE 384]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

known that the One Who was to come was a Sun-spirit and was to save humanity
from the separative influences necessarily contained in all Race-religions.

   These religions were steps which it was necessary for mankind to take  to
prepare for the advent of Christ.  Man must first cultivate a "self"  before
he can become really UNselfish and understand the higher phase of  Universal
Brotherhood--unity of purpose and interest--for which Christ laid the  foun-
dation at His first coming,  and which He will make living realties when  He
returns.

   As the fundamental principle of a Race-religion is separation,  inculcat-
ing self-seeking at the expense of other men and nations, it is evident that
if  the principle is carried to its ultimate conclusion it must  necessarily
have  an increasingly destructive tendency and finally frustrate  evolution,
unless succeeded by a more constructive religion.

   Therefore the separative religions of the Holy Spirit must give place  to
the unifying religion of the Son, which is the Christian religion.

   Law must give place to Love, and the separate Races and Nations be united
in one Universal Brotherhood, with Christ as the Eldest Brother.

   The Christian religion has not yet had time to accomplish this great  ob-
ject.   Man is still in the toils of the dominant Race-spirit and the ideals
of Christianity are yet too high for him.  The intellect can see some of the
beauties,  and readily admits that we should love our enemies,  but the pas-
sions of the desire body are still too strong.   The law of the  Race-spirit
being "An eye for an eye," the Feeling is "I'll get even!"   The heart prays
for Love; the desire body hopes for Revenge.  The intellect sees, IN THE AB-
STRACT,  the  beauty of loving one's enemies but in concrete cases it allies


[PAGE 385]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

itself with the vengeful feeling of the desire body, pleading,  as an excuse
for "getting even," that "the social organism must be protected."

   It is a matter for congratulation, however,  that society feels compelled
to apologize for the retaliative methods used.  Corrective methods and mercy
are  becoming more and more prominent in the administration of the laws,  as
is shown by the favorable reception which has been accorded that very modern
institution,  the Juvenile Court.   Further manifestation of this same  ten-
dency may be noted in the increasing frequency with which convicted  prison-
ers are released on probation, under suspended sentence; also in the greater
humanity with which prisoners of war are treated of late years.   These  are
the vanguards of the sentiment of Universal Brotherhood, which is slowly but
surely makings its influence felt.

   Yet,  though the world is advancing and though, for instance, it has been
comparatively  easy for the writer to secure a hearing for his views in  the
different cities where he has lectured,  the daily papers sometimes devoting
to  his utterances whole pages (and front pages at that) so long as he  con-
fined  himself to speaking of the higher worlds and the POST MORTEM  states,
it has been very noticeable that as soon as the theme was Universal Brother-
hood his articles have ALWAYS been consigned to the waste-basket.

   The  world in general is very unwilling to consider anything that is,  as
it thinks,  "too"  unselfish.  There must be "something in it."   Nothing is
regarded as an entirely natural line of conduct if it offers no  opportunity
for  "getting  the best of" one's fellowmen.   Commercial  undertakings  are
planned and conducted on that principle and,  before the minds of those  who
are  enslaved  by  the  desire  to  accumulate  useless  wealth, the idea of


[PAGE 386]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Universal  Brotherhood  conjures up frightful visions of  the  abolition  of
capitalism and its inevitable concomitant, the exploitation of others,  with
the wreck of "business interests" implied thereby.  The word "enslaved"  ex-
actly describes this condition.  According to the Bible, man was to have do-
minion  over  the world,  but in the vast majority of cases the  reverse  is
true--it is the world which has dominion over man.   Every man who has prop-
erty  interests  will,   in  his  saner  moments,  admit  that  they  are  a
never-failing source of worry to him; that he is constantly scheming to hold
his possessions,  or at least to keep from being deprived of them by  "sharp
practice,"  knowing  that others are as constantly  scheming  to  accomplish
that,  to them,  desirable end.   The man is the slave of what,  with uncon-
scious irony,  he calls "my possessions,' when in reality they possess  him.
Well  did the Sage of Concord say,  "THINGS are in the saddle and ride  man-
kind!"

   This state of affairs is the result of Race-religions,  with their system
of law; therefore do they all look for "One Who is to come."   The Christian
religion ALONE is NOT looking for One Who IS to come,  but for One Who is to
come AGAIN.  The time of this second coming depends upon when the Church can
free itself from the State.   The Church, especially in Europe,  is bound to
the Chariot of State.  The ministers are fettered by economic considerations
and dare not proclaim the truths that their studies have revealed to them.

   A visitor to Copenhagen,  Denmark, recently witnessed a church  confirma-
tion service.  The Church there is under State control and all ministers are
appointed by the temporal power.   The parishioners have nothing whatever to
say in the matter.  They may attend church or not,  as they please, but they


[PAGE 387]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

are compelled to pay the taxes which support the institution.

   In addition to holding office by the bounty of the State,  the pastor  of
the particular church visited was decorated with several Orders conferred by
the king,  the glittering badges bearing silent but eloquent testimony as to
the extent of his subserviency to the State.  During the ceremony, he prayed
for the king and the legislators,  that they might rule the country  wisely.
As long as kings and legislators exists, this prayer might be very appropri-
ate,  but it was a considerable shock to hear him add:  ". . .  .  and,  al-
mighty God, protect and strengthen our army and navy!"

   Such a prayer as this shows plainly that the God worshiped is the  Tribal
or  National  God--the Race-spirit,  for the last act of the  gentle  Christ
Jesus  was  to  stay the sword of the friend who would  have  protected  Him
therewith.  Although He said He had not come to send peace, but a sword,  it
was  because  He foresaw the oceans of blood that would be  spilled  by  the
militant "Christian"  nations in their mistaken understanding of His  teach-
ings  and  because high ideals cannot be immediately attained  by  humanity.
The wholesale murder of war and like atrocities are harsh,  but they are po-
tent illustrations of what Love would abolish.

   There is,  apparently,  a flat contradiction between the words of  Christ
Jesus,  "I came not to send peace, but a sword," and the words of the celes-
tial song which heralded the birth of Jesus,  "On earth Peace,  Goodwill to-
ward men."  This contradictions, however, is apparent only.

   There  is as great an apparent contradiction between a woman's words  and
her actions when she says, "I am going to clean house and tidy up," and then


[PAGE 388]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

proceeds to take up carpets and pile chairs one upon another, producing gen-
eral confusion in a previously orderly house.   One observing only this  as-
pect  of the matter,  would be justified in saying,  "She is making  matters
worse  instead of better,"  but when the purpose of her work is  understood,
the  expediency  of the temporary disorder is realized and in  the  end  her
house will be the better for the passing disturbance.

   Similarly, we must bear in mind that the time which has elapsed since the
coming  of Christ Jesus is but little more than a moment in comparison  with
the  duration  of  even one Day of Manifestation.   We must  learn,  as  did
Whitman,  to  "know the amplitude of time,"  and look beyond  the  past  and
present cruelties and jealousies of the warring sects to the shining age  of
Universal Brotherhood, which will mark the next great step of man's progress
on his long and wondrous journey from the clod to the God,  from  protoplasm
to conscious unity with the Father, that

         . . . one far-off, divine event
         To which the whole creation moves.

   It may be added that the above mentioned pastor,  during the ceremony  of
receiving  his  pupils into the Church taught them that Jesus Christ  was  a
composite individual;  that Jesus was mortal,  human part,  while Christ was
the divine,  immortal Spirit.   Presumably, if the matter had been discussed
with him, he would not have supported this statement, nevertheless in making
it he stated an occult fact.

                           THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM.

   The unifying influence of the Christ has been symbolized in the beautiful
legend  of  the worship of the three magi,  or "wise men of  the  East,"  so
skillfully woven by General Lew Wallace into his  charming story, "Ben Hur."


[PAGE 389]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

   The three wise men--Caspar,  Melchior and Balthasar--are the  representa-
tives of the white,  yellow and black Races and symbolize the people of  Eu-
rope,  Asia and Africa, who are all led by The Star to the World-Savior,  to
Whom  eventually "every knee shall bow," and Whom "every tongue  shall  con-
fess";  Who shall unite all the scattered nations under the Banner of  Peace
and Goodwill;  Who shall cause men to "beat their words into plowshares  and
their spears into pruning hooks."

   The  Star of Bethlehem is said to have appeared at the time of the  birth
of Jesus, and to have guided the three wise men to the Savior.

   Much  speculation  has been indulged in as to the nature  of  this  Star.
Most material scientists have declared it a myth,  while others have said if
it were anything more than a myth,  it might have been a  "coincidence"--two
dead  Suns  might have collided and caused a conflagration.   Every  mystic,
however,  knows the "Star"--yea,  and the "Cross"  also--not only as symbols
connected with the life of Jesus and Christ Jesus,  but in his own  personal
experience.   Paul says:   "Until Christ be formed in you";  and the mystic,
Angelus Silesius, echoes:

   Though Christ a thousand times in Bethlehem be born
   And not within thyself, thy soul will be forlorn.
   The Cross on Golgotha thou lookest to in vain
   Unless within thyself it be set up again.

   Richard Wagner shows the intuitional knowledge of the artist when, to the
question of Parsifal, "Who is The Grail?"  Gurnemanz answers:

   That tell we not;
   But if thou hast by Him been bidden,
   From thee the truth will not stay hidden.
   . . . The land to Him no path leads through,
   And search but severs from Him wider
   When He Himself is not the Guider.


[PAGE 390]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Under the "old dispensation" the path to Initiation was not open.  It was
for only the chosen few.  Some might seek the path,  but only those who were
guided  to the Temples by the Hierophants found entrance.   Previous to  the
advent of Christ,  there was no such sweeping invitation as "Whosoever  will
may come."

   At  the moment the blood flowed on Golgotha,  however,  "the veil of  the
Temple  was rent"  (for reasons presently to be explained),  and ever  since
that tine, whosoever will seek admittance will surely find it.

   In the Temples of Mystery the Hierophant taught his pupils that there  is
in the Sun a spiritual,  as well as a physical force.   The latter force  in
the rays of the Sun is the fecundating principle in nature.   It causes  the
growth of the plant world and thereby sustains the animal and human kingdom.
It is the upbuilding energy which is the source of all physical force.

   This physical,  solar energy reaches its highest expression in midsummer,
when the days are longest and the nights are shortest,  because the rays  of
the  Sun then fall directly on the northern hemisphere.   At that  time  the
spiritual forces are the most inactive.

   On  the  other  hand,  in December, during the long  winter  nights,  the
physical  force of the solar orb is dormant and the spiritual  forces  reach
their maximum degree of activity.

   The  night between the 24th and the 25th of December is The  Holy  Night,
PAR EXCELLENCE, of the entire year.  The Zodiacal sign of the immaculate ce-
lestial Virgin stands upon the eastern horizon near midnight, the Sun of the
New  Year  is then born and starts upon his journey  from  the  southernmost
point  toward  the  northern  hemisphere,  to  save  that  part  of humanity


[PAGE 391]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

(physically)  from the darkness and famine which would inevitably result  if
he were to remain permanently south of the equator.

   To the people of the northern hemisphere, where all our present day reli-
gions originated, the Sun is directly below the Earth; and the spiritual in-
fluences are strongest, in the north, at midnight of the 24th of December.

   That being the case,  it follows as a matter of course that it would then
be easiest for those who wished to take a definite step toward Initiation to
get in conscious touch with the spiritual Sun especially for the first time.

   Therefore the pupils who were ready for Initiation were taken in hand  by
the  Hierophants of the Mysteries,  and be means of ceremonies performed  in
the  Temple,  were raised to a state of exaltation wherein they  transcended
physical  conditions.   To their spiritual vision,  the solid  Earth  become
transparent  and they was the Sun at midnight--"The Star!"   It was not  the
physical Sun they saw with spiritual eyes,  however,  but the Spirit in  the
Sun--The  Christ--their  Spiritual Savior,  as the physical  Sun  was  their
physical Savior.

   This is the Star that shone on that Holy Night and that still shines  for
the  mystic  in  the darkness of night.   When the noise  and  confusion  of
physical activity are quieted,  he enters into his closet and seeks the  way
to the King of Peace.   The Blazing Star is ever there to guide him and  his
soul hears the prophetic song, "On earth Peace, Goodwill toward men."

   Peace and goodwill to all,  without exception; no room for one single en-
emy  or outcast!   Is it any wonder that it is hard to educate  humanity  to
such  a high standard?   Is there any better way to show the beauty of,  and
the necessity for peace, goodwill and love than by contrasting them with the
present state of war, selfishness and hate?


[PAGE 392]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The stronger the light,  the deeper the shadow it casts.   The higher our
ideals, the more plainly can we see our shortcomings.

   Unfortunately,  at the present stage of development,  humanity is willing
to  learn only by the hardest experience.  As a Race,  it must become  abso-
lutely selfish to feel the bitter pangs caused by the selfishness of others,
as one must know much sickness to be thoroughly thankful for health.

   The religion MIScalled Christianity has therefore been the bloodiest  re-
ligion known, not excepting Mohammedanism, which in this respect is somewhat
akin to our malpracticed Christianity.   On the battle field  and in the In-
quisition innumerable and unspeakable atrocities have been committed in  the
name  of the gentle Nazarene.   The Sword and the Wine  Cup,--the  perverted
Cross and Communion Chalice--have been the means by which the more  powerful
of  the  so-called  Christian  nations gained  supremacy  over  the  heathen
peoples, and even over other but weaker nations professing the same faith as
their  conquerors.    The  most  cursory  reading  of  the  history  of  the
Graeco-Latin, Teutonic and Anglo-Saxson Races will corroborate on this.

   While  man was under the FULL sway of Race-religions each nation  was  an
united  whole.   Individual interests were willing subordinated to the  com-
munity interests.   All were "under the law."  All were members of their re-
spective tribes first, and individuals only secondarily.

   At the present time there is a tendency toward the other extreme--to  ex-
alt "self" above all else.  The result is evident in the economic and indus-
trial problems that are facing every nation and clamoring for solution.

   The  state  of  development wherein every man feels himself an absolutely


[PAGE 393]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

separate unit, an Ego, independently pursuing his own course, is a necessary
stage.  The national, tribal and family unity must first be broken up before
Universal  Brotherhood can become a fact.   The REGIME  of  Paternalism  has
been largely superseded by the reign of Individualism.   We are learning the
evils  of  the  latter  more and more as  our  civilization  advances.   Our
unsystematic method of distributing the products of labor,  the rapacity  of
the  few  and  the  exploitation of  many--these  social  crimes  result  in
under-consumption, industrial depressions and labor disturbances, destroying
internal  peace.   The  industrial war of the present  day  is  vastly  more
far-reaching and destructive than the military wars of the nations.
[PAGE 393 cont'd]                                     CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

                          THE HEART AS AN ANOMALY.

   No lesson,  though its truth may be superficially assented to,  is of any
real value as an active principle of the life until the heart has learned it
in longing and bitterness,  and the lesson man must so learn is that what is
not  beneficial  to all can never be truly beneficial to  any.   For  nearly
2,000 years we have lightly assented with out lips that we should govern our
lives in accordance with such maxims as "Return good for evil."   The  Heart
urges mercy and love,  but the Reason urges belligerent and retaliatory mea-
sures,  if not as revenge, at least as a means of preventing a repetition of
hostilities.   It is this divorce of head from heart that hinders the growth
of a true feeling of Universal Brotherhood and the adoption of the teachings
of Christ--the Lord of Love.

   The mind is the focusing point by means of which the Ego becomes aware of
the material universe.  As an instrument for the acquisition of knowledge in


[PAGE 394]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

those  realms the mind is invaluable,  but when it arrogates to  itself  the
ROLE of dictator as to the conduct of man to man,  it is as through the lens
should  say  to an astronomer who was in the act of  photographing  the  Sun
through a telescope:   "You have me improperly focused.  You are not looking
at the Sun correctly.   I do not think it is good to photograph the Sun any-
way, and I want you to point me at Jupiter.  The rays of the Sun heat me too
much and are liable to damage me."

   If the astronomer exercises his will and focuses the telescope as he  de-
sires,  telling it to attend to its business of transmitting the  rays  that
strike it,  leaving the results to him. the work will proceed well,  but  if
the  lens  has the stronger will and the mechanism of the  telescope  is  in
league with it,  the astronomer will be seriously hampered in having to con-
tend with a refractory instrument,  and the result will be blurred pictures,
of little or no value.

   Thus it is with the Ego.   It works with a threefold body,  which it con-
trols, or should control through the mind.  But, sad to say, this body has a
will of its own and is often aided and abetted by the mind, thus frustrating
the purposes of the Ego.

   This antagonistic "lower will" is an expression of the higher part of the
desire body.   When the division of the Sun, Moon, and Earth took place,  in
the   early  part  of  Lemurian  Epoch,   the  more  advanced   portion   of
humanity-in-the-making  experienced  a division of the desire  body  into  a
higher  and a lower part.   The rest of humanity did likewise in  the  early
part of the Atlantean Epoch.

   This  higher  part of the desire body become a sort of animal  soul.   It
built the cerebro-spinal nervous systems and the voluntary muscles,  by that
means  controlling  the  lower  part of the threefold body until the link of


[PAGE 395]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

mind was given.   Then the mind "coalesced" with this animal soul and become
a co-regent.

   The mind is thus bound up in desire; is enmeshed in the selfish lower na-
ture,  making it difficult for the spirit to control the body.  The focusing
mind,  which should be the ally of the higher nature, is alienated by and in
league with the lower nature--enslaved by desire.

   The law of the Race religions was given to emancipate intellect from  de-
sire.   The  "fear of God"  was pitted against "the desires of  the  flesh."
This, however, was not enough to enable one to become master of the body and
secure its willing co-operation.  It became necessary for the spirit to find
in  the body another point of vantage,  which was not under the sway of  the
desire  nature.   All  muscles  are expressions of the  desire  body  and  a
straight road to the capital,  where the traitorous mind is wedded to desire
and reigns supreme.

   If the United States were at war with France, it would not land troops in
England, hoping in that way to subjugate the French.  It would land its sol-
diers directly in France, and fight there.

   Like a wise general, the Ego followed a similar course of action.  It did
not commence its campaign by getting control of one of the glands,  for they
are expressions of the vital body; nor was it possible to get control of the
voluntary muscles, for they are too well garrisoned by the enemy.  That part
of  the involuntary muscular system which is controlled by  the  sympathetic
nervous  system would also be useless for the purpose.   It must get into  a
more direct touch with the cerebro-spinal nervous system.   To do this,  and
secure a base of operations in the enemy's country, it must control a muscle


[PAGE 396]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

which is involuntary,  and yet connected with the voluntary nervous  system.
Such a muscle is the heart.

   We have previously spoken of the two kinds of muscles--voluntary and  in-
voluntary.   The latter are formed in lengthwise stripes and  are  connected
with functions not under the control of the will, such as digestion,  respi-
ration,  excretion,  etc.   The voluntary muscles are those which  are  con-
trolled  by  the  will through the voluntary nervous  system,  such  as  the
muscles  of the hand and arm.   They are striped BOTH lengthwise and  cross-
wise.

   The above is true of all muscles in the body EXCEPT THE HEART,  which  is
an involuntary muscle.  Ordinarily, we cannot control the circulation.   Un-
der normal conditions the heart-beat is a fixed quantity,  yet to the bewil-
derment  of  physiologists,  the heart is  CROSS-striped  like  a  voluntary
muscle.   It is the only organ in the body exhibiting this peculiarity  but,
sphinx-like, it refuses to give material scientists an answer to the riddle.

   The  occult  scientist easily finds the answer in the memory  of  nature.
From  that record he learns that when the Ego first sought a  stronghold  in
the heart, the latter was striped lengthwise only, the same as any other in-
voluntary  muscle;  but  as the Ego gained more and more  control  over  the
heart, the cross-stripes have gradually developed.  They are not so numerous
nor  so well defined as on the muscles under the full control of the  desire
body,  but as the altruistic principles of love and brotherhood increase  in
strength  and  gradually overrule the reason, which is based in  desire,  so
will these cross stripes become more numerous and more marked.

   As previously stated,  the seed-atom of the dense body is located in  the
heart during life and withdrawn only at death.   The active work of the  Ego
is  in  the blood.  Now, if we except the lungs, the heart is the only organ


[PAGE 397]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

in the body through which all the blood passes in every cycle.

   The blood is the highest expression of the vital body,  for it  nourishes
the entire physical organism.   It is also, in a sense,  the vehicle of  the
subconscious memory,  and in touch with the Mercury of Nature,  situated  in
the highest division of the Etheric Region.   The blood carries the pictures
of life from ancestors to descendants for generations, where there is a com-
mon blood, as produced by inbreeding.

   There are in the head three points, each of which is the particular  seat
of one of the three aspects of the spirit (See diagram 17),  the second  and
third aspects having, in addition, secondary vantage grounds.

   The desire body is the perverted expression of the Ego.   It converts the
"Selfhood"  of the spirit into "selfishness."  Selfhood seeks not its own at
the  expense of others.   Selfishness seeks gain regardless of others.   The
seat of the human spirit is primarily in the pineal gland and secondarily in
the  brain and cerebro-spinal nervous system,  which controls the  voluntary
muscles.

   The  love and unity in the World of the Life Spirit find  their  illusory
counterpart in the Etheric Region,  to which we are correlated by the  vital
body, which latter promotes sex love and sex union.  The life spirit has its
seat primarily in the pituitary body and secondarily in the heart,  which is
the gateway of the blood that nourishes the muscles.

   The actionless Divine Spirit--The Silent Watcher--finds its material  ex-
pression in the passive,  inert and irresponsive skeleton of the dense body,
which is the obedient instrument of other bodies, but has no power to act on
its  own initiative.   The Divine Spirit has its strong hold in  the  impen-
etrable point at the root of the nose.


[PAGE 398]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   In reality there is but one spirit,  the Ego,  but looking at it from the
Physical  World,  it  is refracted into the three  aspects,  which  work  as
stated.

   As the blood passes through the heart, cycle after cycle, hour after hour
all  through life,  it engraves the pictures it carries upon the  seed-atoms
while they are still fresh,  thus making a faithful record of the life which
is  indelibly  impressed on the soul in the POST MORTEM  existence,   It  is
always in closest touch with the life spirit,  the spirit of love and unity,
therefore the heart is the home of altruistic love.

   As  these pictures pass inward to the World of Life Spirit,  in which  is
the  true  memory  of nature,  they do not come through  the  slow  physical
senses,  but  directly  through the fourth ether contained  in  the  air  we
breathe.  In the World of Life Spirit the life spirit sees much more clearly
than it can in the denser Worlds.   In its high home it is in touch with the
Cosmic  Wisdom and in any situation it knows at once what to do and  flashes
the  message of guidance and proper action back to the heart,  which as  in-
stantaneously  flashes  it  on  the the brain  through  the  medium  of  the
pneumo-gastric nerve,  resulting in "first impressions"--the intuitional im-
pulse,  which is always good, because it is drawn directly from the fountain
of Cosmic Wisdom and Love.

   This is all done so quickly that the heart has control before the  slower
reason  has  had time to "take in the situation,"  as it were.   It  is  the
thought  that man "thinketh in his heart,"  and it is true that "so is  he."
Man is inherently a virgin spirit,  good,  noble and true in every  respect.
All that is not good is from the lower nature,  that illusory reflection  of
the Ego.  The virgin spirit is always giving wise counsel.  If we could only


[PAGE 399]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

follow  the impulses of the heart--the first thought--Universal  Brotherhood
would be realized here and now.

   But  that  is just the point where the trouble begins.   After  the  good
counsel of the first thought has been given, the mind begins to reason, with
the  result that,  in the great majority of cases,  it dominates the  heart.
The telescope arranges its own focus and points where it lists,  despite the
astronomer.   The  mind  and the desire body frustrate the  designs  of  the
spirit by taking control and, as they lack the spirit's wisdom,  both spirit
and body suffer.

   Physiologists  note that certain areas of the brain are devoted  to  par-
ticular thought activities and phrenologist have carried this branch of sci-
ence still further.   Now, it is known that thought breaks down and destroys
nerve  tissues.   This and all other waste of the body,  is replaced by  the
blood.   When, through the development of the heart into a voluntary muscle,
the  circulation of the blood finally passes under the absolute  control  of
the  unifying  life spirit--the Spirit of Love--it will then be  within  the
power of that spirit to withhold the blood from those areas of the brain de-
voted to selfish purposes.   As a result,  those particular thought  centers
will gradually atrophy.

   On  the other hand,  it will be possible for the spirit to  increase  the
blood  supply when the mental activities are altruistic,  and thus build  up
the areas devoted to altruism,  so that, in time,  the desire nature will be
conquered  and the mind emancipated by Love from its bondage to desire.   It
is only by complete emancipation,  through Love, that man can ruse above the
law and become a law unto himself.   Having conquered himself,  he will have
conquered all the World.

   The  cross stripes of the heart may be built by certain  exercises  under
occult training,  but as some of these exercises are dangerous,  they should


[PAGE 400]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

be  undertaken  only under the direction of a competent  teacher.   That  no
reader  of  this book may be deceived by imposters  professing  ability  and
willingness  to so train aspirants for a consideration,  it is  emphatically
repeated  that NO TRUE OCCULTIST EVER BOASTS,  ADVERTISES HIS OCCULT  POWER,
SELLS  OCCULT  INFORMATION OR LESSONS AT SO MUCH EACH OR FOR A  COURSE;  NOR
WILL  BE  CONSENT  TO A THEATRICAL DISPLAY.  HIS WORK IS DONE  IN  THE  MOST
UNOBTRUSIVE MANNER POSSIBLE AND SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEGITIMATELY HELP-
ING OTHERS, WITHOUT THOUGHT OF SELF.

   As said in the beginning of this chapter,  all persons earnestly desiring
the higher knowledge may rest assured that if they will but seek,  they will
find the way open for them.   Christ Himself prepared the way for "whosoever
will."   He will help and welcome all real seekers,  who are willing to work
for Universal Brotherhood.

                           THE MYSTERY OF GOLGOTHA.

   During  the  last  2,000 years much has been said  about  "the  cleansing
blood."  The blood of Christ has been extolled from the pulpit as the sover-
eign remedy for sin; the ONLY means of redemption and salvation.

   But  if the laws of Rebirth and Consequence work in such a way  that  the
evolving beings reap as they have sown,  and if the evolutionary impulse  is
constantly   bring  humanity  higher  and  higher,   ultimately  to   attain
perfection--where  then is the need for redemption and salvation?   Even  if
the need existed, how can the death of one individual help the rest?   Would
it  not be nobler to suffer the consequences of one's acts than to hide  be-
hind another?  These are some of the objections to the doctrine of vicarious
atonement  and  redemption  by  the  blood  of Christ Jesus.  We will try to


[PAGE 401]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

answer them before showing the logical harmony between the operation of  the
law of Consequence and the Atonement by Christ.

   In the first place,  it is absolutely true that the evolutionary  impulse
does work to achieve ultimate perfection for all; yet there are some who are
constantly straggling behind.   At the present time, we have just passed the
extreme  point of materiality and are going through the sixteen  Races.   We
are  treading "the sixteen paths to destruction,"  and are  consequently  in
graver  danger of falling behind than at any other part of the  evolutionary
journey.

   In the abstract,  time is nothing.   A number may fall behind so far that
they  must  be  abandoned,  to take up their further  evolution  in  another
scheme,  where they can continue their journey to perfection.   Nevertheless
that was not the evolution originally designed for them and it is reasonable
to suppose that the exalted Intelligences in charge of our evolution use ev-
ery means to bring through in safety as many as possible of the entities un-
der their charge.

   In ordinary evolution,  the laws of Rebirth and Consequence are perfectly
adequate  for bringing the major portion of the life wave up to  perfection,
but they do not suffice in the case of the stragglers,  who are lagging  be-
hind in the various Races.  During the stage of individualism,  which is the
climax  of the illusion of separateness, all mankind needs extra  help,  but
for the stragglers some additional special aid must be provided.

   To give that special aid,  to redeem the stragglers,  was the mission  of
Christ.   He said that He came to seek and to save that which was lost.   He
opened the way of Initiation for all who are willing to seek it.

   Objectors  to  vicarious  atonement  urge:  That  it  is cowardly to hide


[PAGE 402]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

behind another;  that each man should be willing to take the consequence  of
his acts.

   Let us consider an analogous case.   The waters of the Great Lakes narrow
into  the  Niagara River.   For twenty miles this enormous volume  of  water
flows rapidly toward the falls.  The river bed is filled with rocks and if a
person who goes beyond a certain point does not lose his life in the  rapids
above the cataract, he will surely do so by the plunge over the brink.

   Suppose  a  man appeared who,  in pity for the victims  of  the  current,
placed a rope above the cataract,  although he knew that the conditions were
such  that in doing so,  he himself could not by any possible chance  escape
death.   Yet  gladly and of his own free will,  he sacrificed his  life  and
placed  the  rope,  thus modifying former conditions so that  any  otherwise
helpless  victims who would grasp the rope would be saved and  thenceforward
none need be lost.

   What  would we think of a man who had fallen into the water  through  his
own carelessness,  and was struggling madly to reach the shore, if he should
say:   "What!   Save myself and seek to avoid penalty of my carelessness  by
shielding  myself behind the strength of another,  who suffered  through  no
fault  of  his own,  and gave up his life that such as I  might  live?   No,
never!   That would not be "manly."  I will take my deserts!"   Would we not
all agree that the man was a fool?

   Not all are in need of salvation.  Christ knew that there is a very large
class who do not require salvation in this way,  but just as surely as there
are  the ninety-and-nine who are well taken care of by the laws  of  Rebirth
and  Consequence  and will reach perfection in that way,  so there  are  the
"sinners"  who  have  become  "bogged" in matter and cannot escape without a


[PAGE 403]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

rope.  Christ came to save them and to bring peace and good will to all,  by
raising  them to the necessary point of spirituality,  causing a  change  in
their desire bodies which will make the influence of the life spirit in  the
heart more potent.

   His  younger  brother  Sun  spirits,  the  Archangels,   had  worked   as
Race-spirits on the desire bodies of man, but their work had been from WITH-
OUT.   It  was simply a reflected spiritual Sun-force and came  through  the
Moon--as moonlight is reflected sunlight.  Christ, the Chief Initiate of the
Sun spirits,  entered directly into the dense body of the Earth and  brought
the direct Sun-force, thus enabling Him to influence over desire bodies from
WITHIN.

   Man cannot gaze long upon the Sun without becoming blind because its  vi-
brations are so rapid that they destroy the retina of the eye.   But he  can
look  without harmful results upon the Moon,  the vibrations from which  are
much slower; yet they are also sunlight, but the higher vibrations have been
taken up by the Moon, which then reflects the residue to us.

   So it is with the spiritual impulses which help man to evolve.   The rea-
son why the Earth was thrown off from the Sun was because our humanity could
not endure the Sun's tremendous physical and spiritual impulses.  Even after
an  enormous  distance  had  been placed between  the  Earth  and  Sun,  the
spiritual  impulse  would still have been too strong had it  not  been  sent
first to the Moon, to be used by Jehovah, the Regent of the Moon,  for man's
benefit.   A number of Archangels (ordinary Sun spirits) were given  Jehovah
as helpers in reflecting these spiritual impulses from the Sun upon the  hu-
manity of the Earth, in the form of Jehovisitic or Race-religions.

   The lowest vehicle of the Archangels is the desire body.  Our desire body
was  added  in  the  Moon  Period,  at  which  time  Jehovah was the highest


[PAGE 404]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Initiate.   Therefore  Jehovah  is  able to deal  with  man's  desire  body.
Jehovah's lowest vehicle is the human spirit (see diagram 14) and its  coun-
terpart is the desire body.  The Archangels are His helpers because they are
able to manage the spiritual Sun forces and the desire body is their  lowest
vehicle.   Thus they are able to work with and prepare humanity for the time
when  it  can receive the spiritual impulses directly from  the  Solar  Orb,
without the intervention of the Moon.

   Upon Christ,  as the highest Initiate of the Sun Period, is laid the task
of sending out this impulse.   The impulse which Jehovah reflected was  sent
out by Christ,  Who thus prepared both the Earth and humanity for His direct
ingress.

   The  expression,  "prepared the Earth,"  means that all  evolution  on  a
planet is accompanied by the evolution of THAT PLANET ITSELF.   Had some ob-
server  gifted with spiritual sight watched the evolution of our Earth  from
some  distant star,  he would have noticed a gradual change taking place  in
the Earth's desire body.

   Under  the old dispensation the desire bodies of people in  general  were
improved by means of the law.   This work is still going on in the  majority
of people, who are thus preparing themselves for the higher life.

   The higher life (Initiation) does not commence,  however,  until the work
on the vital body begins.  The means used for bringing that into activity is
Love,  or rather Altruism.   The former word has been so abused that  it  no
longer conveys the meaning here required.

   During the old dispensation the path of Initiation was not free and open,
except to the chosen few.   The Hierophants of the Mysteries collected  cer-
tain  families  about  the  Temples,  setting  them apart from all the other


[PAGE 405]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

people.   These chosen families were then rigorously guarded as  to  certain
rites and ceremonies.  Their marriages and sexual intercourse were regulated
by the Hierophants.

   The effect of this was to produce a race having the proper degree of lax-
ity  between the dense and vital bodies; also to wake the desire  body  from
its  state of lethargy during sleep.   Thus a special few were made fit  for
Initiation and were given opportunities that could not be given to all.   We
see  instances of this method among the Jews,  where the tribe of Levi  were
the chosen Templars;  also in the caste of the Brahmins,  who were the  only
priestly class among the Hindus.

   The Mission of Christ,  in addition to saving the lost,  was to make Ini-
tiation  possible to all,  therefore Jesus was not a Levite of the class  to
which  priesthood came by inheritance.   He came from the common people  and
though not of the teacher class, His teaching was higher than that of Moses.

   Christ Jesus did not deny Moses, the law, nor the prophets.   On the con-
trary,  He  acknowledged them all and showed the people that they  were  His
witnesses,  as they all pointed to One Who was to come.   He told the people
that those things had served their purpose and that henceforth Love must su-
persede Law.

   Christ Jesus was killed.   In connection with this fact,  we come to  the
supreme and fundamental difference between Him and the previous teachers, in
whom the Race spirits were born.  They all died and must be reborn again and
again to help their peoples bear their destiny.   The Archangel Michael (the
Race-spirit of the Jews) raised up Moses,  who was taken up to Mount Nebo to
die.  He was reborn as Elijah.  Elijah returned as John the Baptist;  Buddha
died and was reborn as Shankaracharya; Shri Krishna says, "Whenever there is


[PAGE 406]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

decay of Dharma.  . .and. . .exaltation of Adharma, then I myself come forth
for the protection of the good,  for the destruction of evil-doers,  for the
sake of firmly establishing Dharma.  I am born from age to age."

   When death came Moses' face SHONE and Buddha's body become ALIGHT.   They
all reached the stage when the spirit begins to shine from within--but  then
they died.

   Christ Jesus reached that stage on the Mount of Transfiguration.   It  is
of the very highest significance that HIS REAL WORK TOOK PLACE SUBSEQUENT TO
THAT EVENT.  He suffered; was KILLED--and RESURRECTED.

   Being  killed is a very different thing from dying.   The blood that  had
been  the vehicle of the Race-spirit must FLOW and be cleansed of that  con-
taminating influence.  Love of father and mother, exclusive of other fathers
and mothers,  must go--otherwise Universal Brotherhood and an  all-embracing
Altruistic Love could never become an actuality.

                             THE CLEANSING BLOOD.

   When  the Savior Christ Jesus was crucified His body was pierced in  five
places;  in the five centers where the currents of the vital body flow;  and
the  pressure  of  the crown of thorns caused a flow from  the  sixth  also.
(This is a hint to those who already know these currents.   A full  elucida-
tion of this matter cannot be publicly given out at this time.)

   When the blood flowed from these centers, the great Sun-spirit Christ was
liberated from the physical vehicle of Jesus and found Himself IN THE EARTH,
with individual vehicles.  The already existing planetary vehicles He perme-
ated with His own vehicles and, in the twinkling of an eye, diffused His own


[PAGE 407]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

desire body over the planet,  which has enabled Him thenceforth to work upon
the Earth and its humanity from WITHIN.

   At that moment a tremendous wave of spiritual sunlight flooded the Earth.
It  rent the veil which the Race-spirit had hung before the Temple  to  keep
out all but the chosen few,  and it made the Path of Initiation free thence-
forth  to whomsoever will.   So far as concerned the Spiritual Worlds,  this
wave transformed the conditions of the Earth like a flash of lightning,  but
the dense, concrete conditions are, of course, much more slowly affected.

   Like all rapid and high vibrations of light,  this great wave blinded the
people by its dazzling brilliance,  therefore it was said that "the Sun  was
darkened."   The very opposite was what actually occurred.   The Sun was not
darkened,  but shone out in glorious splendor.   It was the excess of  light
that  blinded the people,  and only as the entire Earth absorbed the  desire
body  of  the bright Sun-spirit did the vibration return to  a  more  normal
rate.

   The expression,  "the cleansing blood of Christ Jesus," means that as the
blood flowed on Calvary, it bore with it the great Sun-spirit Christ, Who by
that  means secured admission to the earth itself and since that moment  has
been  its Regent.   He diffused His own desire body throughout  the  planet,
thereby  cleansing it from all the vile influences which had grown up  under
the REGIME of the Race-spirit.

   Under the law all sinned;  nay,  more--they could not help it.   They had
not evolved to where they could do right for Love's sake.  The desire nature
was  so strong that it was an impossibility for them to rule it  altogether,
therefore their debts, engendered under the law of Consequence,  piled up to
monstrous  proportions.  Evolution would have been terribly delayed and many


[PAGE 408]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

lost to our life wave altogether it some help had not been given.

   Therefore did Christ come "to seek and to save that which was lost."   He
took  away the sin of the world by His cleansing blood,  which gave Him  en-
trance to the Earth and its humanity.  He purified the conditions and we owe
it  to  Him  that  we  are  able to  gather  for  our  desire  bodies  purer
desire-stuff than formerly,  and He continues working to help us,  by making
our external environment constantly purer.

   That  this was and is done at the expense of great suffering to  Himself,
no one can doubt who is able to form the least conception of the limitations
endured  by  that  Great  Spirit in entering  the  hampering  conditions  of
physical existence, even in the best and purest vehicle possible; nor is His
present limitation as Regent of the Earth must less painful.   True,  He  is
also Regent of the Sun,  and therefore only partially confined to the Earth,
yet  the  limitations  set by the crampingly slow vibrations  of  our  dense
planet must be almost endurable.

   Had  Christ Jesus simply died,  it would have been impossible for Him  to
have done this work, but the Christians have a RISEN Savior; One Who is ever
present  to help those who call upon His Name.   Having suffered  like  unto
ourselves  in all things and knowing fully our needs,  He is lenient  toward
our  mistakes  and failures so long as we continue trying to live  the  good
life.  We must ever keep before our eyes the fact that THE ONLY REAL FAILURE
IS CEASING TO TRY.

   Upon  the death of the dense body of Christ Jesus,  the seedatom was  re-
turned to the original owner,  Jesus of Nazareth,  who for some time  after-
ward,  while  functioning in a vital body which he had gathered temporarily,


[PAGE 409]                                            CHRIST AND HIS MISSION

taught the nucleus of the new faith which Christ had left behind.   Jesus of
Nazareth has since had the guidance of the esoteric branches which sprang up
all over Europe.

   In many placed the Knights of the Round Table were high Initiates in  the
Mysteries  of the New Dispensation.   So were the Knights of  The  Grail--to
whom was finally confided Joseph of Arimathea's Grail Cup, which was used by
Christ  Jesus at The Last Supper.  They were afterward entrusted  also  with
the  Lance  which pierced His side, and the receptacle  which  received  the
blood from the wound.

   The  Druids  of  Ireland the Trottes of  Northern  Russia  were  esoteric
schools  through  which the Master Jesus worked during the  so-called  "Dark
Ages,"  but,  dark though they were, the spiritual impulse spread,  and from
the standpoint of the occult scientist they were "Bright Ages"  compared  to
the growing materialism of the last 300 years,  which has increased physical
knowledge immensely, but has almost extinguished the Light of the Spirit.

   Tales of "The Grail," "Knights of The Round Table," etc., are now scouted
as superstitions and all that cannot be materially demonstrated is  regarded
as unworthy of belief.   Glorious as are the discoveries of modern  science,
they have been bought at the terrible price of crushing the spiritual  intu-
ition and,  from a spiritual standpoint,  no darker day than the present has
ever dawned.

   The  Elder Brothers,  Jesus among them, have striven and are striving  to
counteract  this terrible influence,  which is like that in the eyes of  the
snake,  causing the bird to fall into its jaws.   Every attempt to enlighten
people and awaken in them a desire to cultivate the spiritual side of  life,
is an evidence of the activity of the Elder Brothers.


[PAGE 410]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   May  their efforts be crowned with success and speed the day when  modern
science shall be spiritualized and conduct its investigation of matter  from
the standpoint of spirit,  for them, and not until then, will it arrive at a
true knowledge of the world.

   The world, the man and the atom are governed by the same law.   Our dense
earth is now in its 4th stage of consolidation.   The mind,  the desire body
and the vital body are less solid than our 4th vehicle, the dense body.   In
the  atomic weight of the chemical elements there is a similar  arrangement.
The 4th group marks the acme of density.

                     FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND INITIATION.

                         THE SEVEN DAYS OF CREATION.

   The  Rosicrucian speaks of the Earth Period as Mars-Mercury.   The  great
creative  Day of Manifestation is embodied in the names of the days  of  the
week,  for  our  week-days have been named  after  the  evolutionary  stages
through which the virgin spirits pass in their pilgrimage through matter.

DAY                     CORRESPONDS TO THE                      IS RULED BY
Saturday............... Saturn Period.......................... Saturn
Sunday................. Sun Period............................. The Sun
Monday................. Moon Period............................ The Moon
Tuesday................ First half of the Earth Period......... Mars
Wednesday.............. Second half of the Earth Period........ Mercury
Thursday............... Jupiter Period......................... Jupiter
Friday................. Venus Period........................... Venus

The Vulcan Period is the last Period of our scheme of evolution.   The quin-
tessence of all the preceding Periods is extracted by the recapitulation  of
spiral after spiral.   No new work is done until the very last Revolution on
the  very  last  Globe and then only in the Seventh  Epoch.   Therefore  the
Vulcan Period may be said to correspond to the week,  which includes all  of
the seven days.

   The claim of astrologers that the days of the week are ruled by the  par-
ticular planet for which they are named, is well-founded.  The ancients were
also  familiar with this occult knowledge, as is shown in their mythologies,


[PAGE 412]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

in  which  the names of the gods are associated with the days of  the  week.
Saturday  is plainly "Saturn's day";  Sunday is correlated to the  Sun,  and
Monday to the Moon.  The Latins call Tuesday "Dies Martis,"  which obviously
shows its connection with Mars, the god of war.   The name "Tuesday"  is de-
rived from "Tirsdag,"  "Tir"  or "Tyr,"  being the name of the Norse god  of
war.   "Wednesday"  was "Wotensdag,"  from Woten, also a Norse  god;  it  is
called "Dies Mercurii"  by the Latins, showing its association with Mercury,
as given in our list.

   Thursday,  or "Thorsdag,"  is named for "Thor," the Norse god of thunder,
and is called "Dies Jovis" by the Latins, after the thunder god,  "Jove"  or
"Jupiter."

   Friday is named for the Norse goddess of beauty, "Freya," and for similar
reasons, the Latins call it "Dies Veneris," or Day of Venus.

   THESE NAMES OF PERIODS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PHYSICAL PLANETS,  BUT
REFER TO PAST, PRESENT OR FUTURE INCARNATIONS OF THE EARTH;  for,  again ap-
plying the Hermetic axiom, "As above, so below,: the macrocosm must have its
incarnations as well as the microcosm, man.

   Occult science teaches that there are 777 incarnations, but that does not
mean  that the Earth undergoes 777 metamorphoses.   It means  that  evolving
life makes
                        7 Revolutions around the
                        7 Globes of the
                        7 World Periods.

   This pilgrimage of Involution and Evolution, including the "short cut" of
Initiation,  is embodied in the Caduceus, or "Staff of Mercury" (see Diagram
15),  so called because this occult symbol indicates The Pat of  Initiation,
which  has been open to man only since the beginning of the Mercury half  of
the  Earth  Period.  Some  of the lesser mysteries were given to the earlier

        THE SEVEN DAYS OF CREATION AND THE FOUR GREAT INITIATIONS.

Lemurians and Atlanteans, but not the Four Great Initiations.

   The black serpent on diagram 15 indicates the winding, cyclic path of In-
volution,  comprising the Saturn, Sun and Moon Periods, and the Mars half of
the Earth Period, during which the evolving life built its vehicles, not be-
coming fully awake and clearly conscious of the outside world until the lat-
ter of the Atlantean Epoch.

   The  white  serpent represents the path that the human race  will  follow
through the Mercury half of the Earth Period,  and the Jupiter,  Venus,  and
Vulcan Periods, during which pilgrimage man's consciousness will expand into
that of an omniscient, Creative Intelligence.

   The serpentine path is the path followed by the great majority;  but  the
"Staff of Mercury," around which the serpents twine, shows the "straight and
narrow way," the path of Initiation, which enables those who walk therein to
accomplish in a few short lives that which it requires millions of years for
the majority of mankind to accomplish.

   It need scarcely be said that no description of the initiatory ceremonies
can be given,  as the first vow of the Initiate is silence; but even if per-
missible,  it  would  not  be important.  What  concerns  us  in  getting  a
bird's-eye view of the evolutionary path is to ascertain the results of  the
ceremonies.

   The whole result of initiation is to give to the spiritually aspiring  an
opportunity  to develop the higher faculties and powers in a short time  and
by severe training,  thereby gaining the expansion of consciousness that all
manking will surely possess eventually,  but which the vast majority  choose
to  acquire through the slow process of ordinary evolution.  We may know the


[PAGE 415]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

states of consciousness and their concomitant powers attained by the  candi-
date as he passes through successive great Initiations provided we know what
those future states and powers will be for humanity in general.   Some hints
have  been given and more may be logically deduced by an application of  the
law of Correspondences, to give a fairly rounded picture of the evolution in
store for all of us, and the magnitude of the great steps in Initiation.  To
do this it may help us to glance back over the steps by which the conscious-
ness of man has been evolved through the various Periods.

   We remember that during the Saturn Period the unconsciousness of man  was
similar to that of the dense body when plunged into the deepest trance  con-
dition;  this was succeeded,  in the Sun period,  by a dreamless-sleep  con-
sciousness.  In the Moon Period the first glimmering of waking showed itself
in inward pictures of outward things.  The entire consciousness consisted of
such  inward representations of external objects,  colors,  or  sounds.   At
last, in the latter part of the Atlantean Epoch, this picture consciousness,
in which objects could be observed outside,  clearly and distinctly outlined
in space.   When this objective-consciousness was attained, man became aware
of  an outside world and for the first time thoroughly realized the  differ-
ence  between "self"  and "others."   He then realized his separateness  and
thenceforth the "I" consciousness, Egoism, became paramount.  As previous to
that  time  there had been no thoughts nor ideas dealing with a  an  outside
world, there had consequently been no memory of events.

   The   change   from   the   internal   picture   consciousness   to   the
objective-self-consciousness was effected by a very slow process,  commensu-
rate with its magnitude,  lasting from the existence on Globe C in the third


[PAGE 416]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

Revolution of the Moon Period, until the latter part of the Atlantean Epoch.

   During  that time the evolving life passed through four great  stages  of
animal-like development before reaching the human stage.  These steps of the
past  correspond to four stages yet to be passed through,  and to  the  four
initiations.

   Within these four stages of consciousness previously passed there are al-
together  thirteen steps,  and from man's present state to the last  of  the
Great Initiations there are also thirteen initiations--the  nine degrees  of
the lesser mysteries and the four Great Initiations.

   There is a similar division among our present animals which can be traced
through Form,  because, as the form is the expression of life,  so each step
in its development must necessarily show a step forward in consciousness.

   Cuvier  was  the  first to divide the animal kingdom  into  four  primary
classes,  but  was not so successful in his division of these  classes  into
sub-classes.   The embryologist, Karl Ernst von Baer, also Professor Agassiz
and  other  scientists,  classify the animal kingdom into four  primary  and
thirteen subdivisions, as follows:

   I    RADIATES:
              1-Polyps, Sea-anemones and Coral.
              2-Acaleph, or Jelly-fish.
              3-Starfish, Sea-urchins.
   II   MOLLUSKS:
              4-Acephala (oysters, etc.).
              5-Gast ropoda (snails).
              6-Cephalopoda.
   III  ARTICULATES:
              7-Worms.
              8-Crustacea (lobsters, etc.).
              9-Insects.
   IV   VERTEBRATES:
              10-Fishes.
              11-Reptiles.
              12-Birds.
              13-Mammals


[PAGE 417]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

   The  first three divisions correspond to the remaining three  Revolutions
of the Mercury half of the Earth Period,  and their nine steps correspond to
the nine degrees of the lesser mysteries, which will have been taken by  hu-
manity in general when it has reached the middle of the last Revolutions  of
the Earth Period.

   The fourth division in the list of the advancing animal kingdom has  four
subdivisions:   Fishes,  Reptiles,  Birds,  and Mammals.   The steps in con-
sciousness thus indicated correspond to similar states of advancement to  be
attained by humanity at the end of the Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan Pe-
riods and which any qualified individual may now attain by initiation.   The
first  of the Great Initiations gives the stage of consciousness which  will
be attained by ordinary humanity at the end of the Earth Period;  the second
that  to which all will attain at the end of the Jupiter Period;  the  third
gives the extension of consciousness to be reached at the close of the Venus
Period;  the last brings to the initiate the power and omniscience to  which
the majority will attain only at the end of the Vulcan Period.

   The  Objective-Consciousness by which we obtain knowledge of the  outside
world  is dependent upon what we perceive through the medium of the  senses.
This  we call "real,"  in contradistinction to our thoughts and ideas  which
come to us through our inner consciousness; their reality is not apparent to
us in the same as that of a book or table,  or other visible or tangible ob-
ject in space.  Thoughts and ideas seem misty and unreal, therefore we speak
of a "mere" thought, or of "just" an idea.

   The ideas and thoughts of today, however,  have an evolution before them;
they  are  destined  to  become  as  real,  clear and tangible as any of the


[PAGE 418]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

objects  of  the outside world which we now perceive  through  the  physical
senses.   At present, when a thing or a color is thought of,  the picture or
color  presented by the memory to our inner consciousness is but a  dim  and
shadowy one compared with the thing thought of.

   As early as the Jupiter Period there will be a marked change in this  re-
spect.  The the dream-pictures of the Moon Period will return, but they will
be subject to the call of the thinker,  and not mere reproductions of  outer
objects.   Thus there will be a combination of the pictures of the Moon  Pe-
riod  and the thoughts and ideas consciously developed during the Earth  Pe-
riod, that is, it will be a Self-Consciousness Picture-Consciousness.

   When a man of the Jupiter Period says "red," or speaks the name of an ob-
ject, a clear and exact reproduction of the particular shade of red of which
he is thinking,  or of the object to which he refers,  will be presented  to
his inner vision and will also be quite visible to the hearer.   There  will
be no misconception as to what is meant by the words spoken.   Thoughts  and
ideas  will be alive and visible, therefore hypocrisy and flattery  will  be
entirely eliminated.  People can be seen exactly as they are.  There will be
both  good and bad,  but the two qualities will not be mingled in  the  same
person.   There will be the thoroughly good man and the downright evil  man,
and  one of the serious problems of that time will be how to deal  with  the
latter.   The Manichees,  an Order of still higher,  spirituality  than  the
Rosicrucians,  are at present studying that very problem.   An idea  of  the
condition  anticipated  may be gained from a short resume or  their  legend.
(All mystic orders have a legend symbolic of their ideals and aspirations.

   In  the  legend  of  the  Manichees  there  are two kingdoms--that of the


[PAGE 419]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Light-Elves and that of the Night Elves.  The latter attack the former,  are
defeated  and must be punished.   But, as the Light-Elves are as  thoroughly
good as the Night-Elves are bad,  they cannot inflict evil upon their  foes,
so they must be punished with Good.   Therefore a part of the kingdom of the
Light-Elves is incorporated with that of the Night-Elves and is this way the
evil is in time overcome.  Hate which will not submit to hate,  must succumb
to Love.

   The  internal  pictures of the Moon Period were a certain  expression  of
man's external environment.   In the Jupiter Period the pictures will be ex-
pressed from within;  they will be an outcome of the inner life of the  man.
He  will  also possess the additional faculty,  which he cultivated  in  the
Earth Period, of seeing things in space outside of himself.  In the Moon Pe-
riod he did not see the concrete thing, but only its soul-qualities.  In the
Jupiter  Period he will see both,  and will thus have a thorough  perception
and understanding of his surroundings.  At a later stage in the same Period,
this  perceptive  ability will be succeeded by a still  higher  phase.   His
power to form clear mental conceptions of colors, objects, or tones will en-
able him to contact and influence supersensuous beings of various orders and
to secure their obedience, employing their forces as he wishes.   He will be
unable  to send out from himself the forces wherewith to carry out  his  de-
signs,  however,  and will be dependent upon the help of these superphysical
beings, who will then be at his service.

   At the close of the Venus Period he will be able to use his own force  to
give his pictures life and to set them out from himself as objects in space.
He will then possess an Objective, Self-Conscious, Creative-Consciousness.

   Very little can be said about the high spiritual consciousness which will


[PAGE 420]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

be attained at the close of the Vulcan Period;  it would be quite beyond our
present comprehension.

                           SPIRALS WITHIN SPIRALS.

   It  must not be supposed that these states of consciousness  commence  at
the  beginning of the Periods to which they belong and last until  the  end.
There is always the Recapitulation,  and therefore there must be the  corre-
sponding stages of consciousness on an ascending scale.   The Saturn Revolu-
tion of any Period,  the stay on Glove A,  and the first Epoch on any Globe,
are repetitions of the Saturn Period states of development.  The Sun Revolu-
tion, the stay on Globe B, and the second Epoch on any Glove are Recapitula-
tions  of  the  Sun Period states of development,  and so on,  all  the  way
through.   Hence it will be seen that the consciousness which is to  be  the
especial and peculiar result or product of any Period,  does not begin to be
evolved    until   all   the   Recapitulations   have   been   made.     The
waking-consciousness  of the Earth Period was not started until  the  Fourth
Revolution,  when the life wave had reached the Fourth Glove (D), and was in
the Fourth or Atlantean Epoch on that Globe.

   The Jupiter Consciousness will not start in the Jupiter Period until  the
Fifth  Revolution,  when the Fifth Globe (E) has been reached and the  Fifth
Epoch commences on that Globe.

   Correspondingly,  the Venus consciousness will not begin until the  Sixth
Revolution  has come to the Sixth Globe and Epoch,  and the  special  Vulcan
work will be confined to the very last Globe and Epoch,  just before the Day
of Manifestation closes.

   The  time  required  for  passing through these respective Periods varies


[PAGE 421]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

greatly.   The  further into matter the virgin spirits descent,  the  slower
their  progress  and the more numerous the steps or stages  of  progression.
After the nadir of material existence has been passed and the life wave  as-
cends into more tenuous and mobile conditions, the progress is gradually ac-
celerated.   The Sun Period is of somewhat longer duration that  the  Saturn
Period,  and the Moon Period is longer than the Sun Period.   The  Mars  (or
first) half of the Earth Period is the longest half of any Period.  Then the
time begins to shorten again,  so that the Mercury half of the Earth  Period
the latter three and a half Revolutions, will occupy less time that the Mars
half; the Jupiter Period will be shorter than the Moon Period; the Venus Pe-
riod  shorter than the corresponding Sun Period;  and the Vulcan Period  the
shortest Period of them all.

   The states of consciousness of the different Periods may be tabulated  as
follows:

PERIOD        CORRESPONDING CONSCIOUSNESS
Saturn....... Unconsciousness corresponding to deep trance
Sun.......... Unconsciousness resembling dreamless sleep
Moon......... Picture consciousness corresponding to dream state
Earth........ Waking, objective consciousness
Jupiter...... Self-conscious picture consciousness
Venus........ Objective, Self-conscious, Creative consciousness
Vulcan....... Highest Spiritual Consciousness

   Having taken a general survey of the states of consciousness to be devel-
oped  in the next three and a half Periods,  we will now study the means  of
attainment.

                           ALCHEMY AND SOUL-GROWTH

   The dense body was started in the Saturn Period,  passed through  various
transformations  in  the  Sun  and  Moon Periods, and will reach its highest


[PAGE 422]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

development in the Earth Period.

   The  vital body was started in the second Revolution of the  Sun  Period,
was reconstructed in the Moon and Earth Periods,  and will reach  perfection
in the Jupiter Period, which is its fourth stage, as the Earth Period is the
fourth stage for the dense body.

   The  desire  body was started in the Moon period,  reconstructed  in  the
Earth period, will be further modified in the Jupiter Period,  reaching per-
fection in the Venus period.

   The mind was started in the Earth Period, will be modified in the Jupiter
and Venus Periods, and attain perfection in the Vulcan Period.

   Reference to diagram 8 will show that the lowest Globe of the Jupiter Pe-
riod is located in the Etheric Region.   It would therefore be impossible to
use  the dense physical vehicle there,  as only a vital body can be used  in
the  Etheric Region.   Yet it must not be supposed that after  spending  the
time from the beginning of the Saturn Period to the end of the Earth  Period
in completing and perfecting this body,  it is then thrown away that man may
function in a "higher" vehicle!

   Nothing  in Nature is wasted.   In the Jupiter Period the forces  of  the
dense body will be superimposed upon the completed vital body.  That vehicle
will then possess the powers of the dense body in addition to its own facul-
ties,  and will therefore be a much more valuable instrument for the expres-
sion of the threefold spirit that if built from its own forces alone.

   Similarly,  Globe  D of the Venus Period is located in the  Desire  World
(see Diagram 8),  hence neither a dense nor a vital body could be used as an
instrument  of  consciousness, therefore the essences of the perfected dense


[PAGE 423]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

and vital bodies are incorporated in the completed desire body,  the  latter
thus becoming a vehicle of transcendent qualities, marvelously adaptable and
so  responsive  to the slightest wish of the indwelling spirit that  in  our
present limitations, it is beyond our utmost conception.

   Yet the efficiency of even this splendid vehicle will be transcended when
in  the Vulcan period its essence,  together with the essences of the  dense
and vital bodies,  are added to the mind body,  which becomes the highest of
man's  vehicles,  containing within itself the quintessence of all that  was
best in all the vehicles.   The vehicle of the Venus Period being beyond our
present power of conception,  how much more so is that which will be at  the
service of the divine beings of the Vulcan Period!

   During  involution the creative Hierarchies assisted man to  arouse  into
activity the threefold spirit, the Ego, to build the threefold body,  and to
acquire the link of mind.  Now, however, on the seventh day (to use the lan-
guage of the Bible),  God rests.  Man must work out his own salvation.   The
threefold  spirit  must complete the working out of the plan  begun  by  the
Gods.

   The  human spirit,  which was awakened during Involution in the Moon  Pe-
riod,  will be the most prominent of the three aspects of the spirit in  the
evolution  of the Jupiter Period,  which is the corresponding Period on  the
upward arc of the spiral.  The life spirit,  which was started into activity
in the Sun Period, will manifest its principal activity in the corresponding
Venus  Period,  and the particular influences of the Divine Spirit  will  be
strongest in the Vulcan Period, because it was vivified in the corresponding
Saturn Period.

   All three  aspects of the spirit are active all the time during evolution


[PAGE 424]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

but  the  principal activity of each aspect will be unfolded in  those  par-
ticular Periods, because the work to be done there is its special work.

   When the threefold spirit had evolved the threefold body and gained  con-
trol of it through the focus of Mind,  it commenced to evolve the  threefold
soul by working from within.   How much or how little soul a man has depends
upon  the amount of work the spirit has done in the bodies.   This has  been
explained in the chapter describing post mortem experiences.

   As  much of the desire body as has been worked upon by the Ego is  trans-
muted  into the emotional soul,  and is ultimately assimilated by the  human
spirit, the special vehicle of which is the desire body.

   As much of the vital body as has been worked upon by the life spirit, be-
comes the Intellectual soul, and it builds the life spirit, because that as-
pect of the threefold spirit has its counterpart in the vital body.

   As much of the dense body as has been worked upon by the Divine Spirit is
called  the Conscious soul,  and is ultimately merged in the Divine  Spirit,
because the dense body is its material emanation.

   The Conscious soul grows by action, external impacts, and experience.

   The  Emotional soul grows by the feelings and emotions generated  by  ac-
tions and experiences.

   The Intellectual soul,  as mediator between the other two,  grows by  the
exercise of memory,  by which it links together past and present experiences
and  the  feelings  engendered thereby, thus creating  "sympathy"  and  "an-
tipathy,"  which could not exist apart from memory, because the feelings re-
sulting from experience alone would be evanescent.


[PAGE 425]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

   During the involution the spirit progressed by growing bodies, but evolu-
tion  depends upon soul growth--the transmutation of the bodies  into  soul.
The soul is,  so to say,  the quintessence,  the power or force of the body,
and when a body has been completely built and brought to perfection  through
the  stages  and Periods as above described,  the soul  is  fully  extracted
therefrom and is absorbed by the one of the three aspects of the the  spirit
which generated the body in the first place; thus:

   The  CONSCIOUS  SOUL will be absorbed by the DIVINE SPIRIT in the seventh
Revolution of the Jupiter Period;
   The  INTELLECTUAL  SOUL  will be absorbed by the LIFE SPIRIT in the sixth
Revolution of the Venus Period;
   The  EMOTIONAL  SOUL  will  be  absorbed by the HUMAN SPIRIT in the fifth
Revolution of the Vulcan Period.

                             THE CREATIVE WORD.

   The  mind is the most important instrument possessed by the  spirit,  and
its special instrument in the work of creation.   The spiritualized and per-
fected larynx will speak the creative Word, but the perfect mind will decide
as to the particular form and the volume of vibration,  and will thus be the
determining factor.  Imagination will be the spiritualized faculty directing
the work of creation.

   There  is a strong tendency at the present time to regard the faculty  of
imagination slightingly,  yet it is one of the most important factors in our
civilization.   It it were not for the imagination,  we would still be naked
savages.  Imagination planned our houses, our clothes and our transportation
and  transmission facilities.   Had not the inventors of these  improvements
possessed the mind and imagination to form mental images,  the  improvements
could  never  have  become concrete realities.  In our materialistic day and


[PAGE 426]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

age  there is scarcely an effort made to conceal the contempt in  which  the
faculty of imagination is generally held,  and none feel the effects of this
more acutely than inventors.  They are usually classes as "cranks,"  and yet
they  have been the chief factors in the subjugation of the  Physical  World
and in making our social environment what it is today.   Any improvement  in
spiritual or physical conditions must first be imagined as a possibility be-
fore it can become an actuality.

   If  the student will turn to diagram 1 this fact will become  clear.   In
the comparison there drawn between the functions of the different human  ve-
hicles and the part of a stereoptican, the mind corresponds to the lens.  It
is  the focusing medium whereby the ideas wrought by the imagination of  the
spirit  are projected upon the material universe.   First they  are  thought
norms  only,  but when the desire to realize the imagined possibilities  has
set the man to work in the Physical World, they become what we call concrete
"realities."

   At the present time,  however,  the mind is not focused in a way that en-
ables  it to give a clear and true picture of what the spirit imagines.   It
is not one-pointed.  It gives misty and clouded pictures.   Hence the neces-
sity  of  experiment to show the inadequacies of the first  conception,  and
bring about new imaginings and ideas until the image produced by the  spirit
in mental substance has been reproduced in physical substance.

   At  the best,  we are able to shape through the mind only such images  as
have to do with Form, because the human mind was not started until the Earth
Period,  and therefore is now in its form, or "mineral" stage,  hence in our
operations we are confined to forms,  to minerals.   We can imagine ways and
means of working with the mineral forms of the three lower kingdoms, but can


[PAGE 427]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

do  little or nothing with the living bodies.   We may indeed  graft  living
branch to living tree, or living part of animal or man to other living part,
but it is not life with which we are working; it is form only.   We are mak-
ing different conditions, but the life which already inhabited the form con-
tinues to do so still.   To create life is beyond man's power until his mind
has become alive.

   In  the Jupiter Period the mind will be vivified to some extent  and  man
can then imagine forms which will live and grow, like plants.

   In the Venus Period, when his mind has acquired "Feeling,"  he can create
living, growing, and feeling things.

   When he reaches perfection,  at the end of the Vulcan Period,  he will be
able to "imagine" into existence creatures that will live, grown, feel,  and
think.

   In the Saturn Period the life wave which is now man started on its evolu-
tion.   The Lords of Mind were then human.  They worked with man at that Pe-
riod, when he was mineral.  They now have nothing to do with the lower king-
doms, but are concerned solely with our human development.

   Our present animals started their mineral existence in the Sun Period, at
which time the Archangels were human, therefore the Archangels are the  rul-
ers and guides of the evolution of that which is now animal,  but have noth-
ing to do with plant or mineral.

   The  present plants had their mineral existence in the Moon period.   The
Angels  were then human,  therefore they have special concern with the  life
that now inhabits the plants,  to guide it up to the human stage;  but  they
have no interest in the minerals.

   Our  present  humanity  will  have  to work with the new life wave, which


[PAGE 428]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

entered evolution in the Earth Period and NOW ENSOULS THE MINERALS.   We are
now  working  with  it by means of the faculty  of  imagination,  giving  it
form--building it into ships, bridges, railways, houses, etc.

   In the Jupiter Period we shall guide the evolution of the plant  kingdom,
for  that which is at present mineral will then have a plant-like  existence
and  we must work with it there as the Angels are now doing with  out  plant
kingdom.  Our faculty of imagination will be so developed that we shall have
the  ability,  not only to create forms by means of it,  but to endow  those
forms with vitality.

   In the Venus Period our present mineral life wave shall have advanced an-
other  step,  and we shall be doing for the animals of that period what  the
Archangels  are  now doing for our animals--giving them living  and  feeling
forms.

   Lastly, in the Vulcan Period it will be our privilege to give them a ger-
minal mind,  as the Lords of Mind did to us.  The present minerals will then
have  become  the humanity of the Vulcan Period,  and we shall  have  passed
through stages similar to those through which the Angels and Archangels  are
now  passing.   We  shall then have reached a point in  evolution  a  little
higher that that of the present Lords of Mind, for remember,  there is never
an exact reproduction anywhere, but always progressive improvement,  because
of the spiral.

   The Divine Spirit will absorb the human spirit at the close of the  Jupi-
ter Period;  the life spirit at the close of the Venus Period;  and the per-
fected  Mind,  embodying  all that it has  garnered  during  its  pilgrimage
through all the seven Periods,  will be absorbed by the Divine Spirit at the
close  of the Vulcan Period.   (There is no contradiction of  the  foregoing
statement  made  elsewhere  that  the Emotional soul will be absorbed by the


[PAGE 429]                                                FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

human spirit in the fifth Revolution of the Vulcan Period,  because the lat-
ter will then be within the Divine Spirit.)

   Then  will succeed the long interval of subjective activity during  which
the virgin spirit will assimilate all the fruits of the septenary Periods of
active  Manifestation.   It is then merged in God,  from Whom  it  came,  to
re-emerge at the dawn of another Great Day,  as One of His glorious helpers.
During  its past evolution its latent possibilities have been transmuted  to
dynamic  powers.   It  has acquired Soul-power and a Creative  Mind  as  the
fruitage of its pilgrimage through matter.   It has advanced from  IMPOTENCE
TO OMNIPOTENCE, FROM NESCIENCE TO OMNISCIENCE.

                THE METHOD OF ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE.

                               THE FIRST STEPS.

   The  time has now come for pointing out the way by which each  individual
may investigate for himself all the facts with which we have dealt thus  far
in our study.  As stated in the beginning, there are no special "gifts"  be-
stowed upon any.   All may know for themselves the truth concerning the pil-
grimage  of the soul,  the past evolution and future destiny of  the  world,
without being compelled to depend upon the veracity of another.   There is a
method whereby this valuable faculty may be acquired,  and the earnest  stu-
dent quality himself to investigate those super-physical realms; a method by
which, if persistently followed, the powers of a God may be developed.

   A  simple  illustration  may indicate the first  steps.   The  very  best
medicine is well-nigh helpless without the tools of his craft.  Indeed it is
the hall mark of a good artisan that he is very fastidious as to the quality
and  condition of the tools he uses, because he knows that the work  depends
as much upon their excellence as upon his skill.

   The Ego has several instruments--a dense  body,  a vital body,  a  desire
body,  and a mind.  These are its tools and upon their quality and condition
depends  how much or how little it can accomplish in its work  of  gathering
experience in each life.  If the instruments are poor and dull there will be


[PAGE 431]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

but little spiritual growth and the life will be a barren one, so far as the
spirit is concerned.

   We generally estimate a "successful" life by the bank account, the social
position attained,  or the happiness resulting from a carefree existence and
a sheltered environment.

   When life is regarded is that way all the principal things that make  for
permanency  are forgotten;  the individual is blinded by the evanescent  and
illusionary.   A bank account seems such a very real success,  the  fact  is
forgotten that from the moment the Ego leaves the body,  it has no equity in
gold  nor any other earthly treasure.   It may even have to answer  for  the
methods employed in amassing that hoard and suffer great pain in seeing oth-
ers spend it.   It is forgotten that the important social position also dis-
appears  when  the silver cord is loosed.   Those who once fawned  may  then
sneer, and even those who were faithful in life might shudder at the thought
of an hour spent with no company but that of the dead.   All that if of this
life alone in vanity.  Only that is of true value which can be taken with us
across the threshold as the treasure of the spirit.

   The hot-house plant may look very beautiful as it blooms in its sheltered
glass house,  but should the furnace fire go out,  it would wither and  die,
while the plant that has grown in rain and sunshine, through storm and calm,
will survive the winter and bloom afresh each year.   From the viewpoint  of
the  soul,  happiness and a sheltered environment are generally  unfortunate
circumstances.   The  petted and fondled lap dog is subject to  diseases  of
which the homeless cur,  which has to fight for a scrap from a garbage  can,
knows nothing.  The cur's life is hard, but it gets experience that makes it


[PAGE 432]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

alert,  alive and resourceful.   Its life is rich in events,  and it reaps a
harvest  of experience,  while the pampered lap dog drones it time  away  in
fearful monotony.

   The case of a human being is somewhat similar.   It may be hard to  fight
poverty  and hunger,  but from the standpoint of the soul it  is  infinitely
preferable  to a life of idle luxury.  Where wealth is nothing more  than  a
handmaid of well thought out philanthropy,  which helps man in such a way as
to really uplift him,  it may be a very great blessing and a means of growth
for  its possessor,  but when used for selfish purposes and  oppression,  it
cannot be regarded as other than an unmitigated curse.

   The  soul is here to acquire experience through its  instruments.   These
are the tools furnished to each at birth,  and they are good,  bad or indif-
ferent  according  to what we have learned through past  experience  in  the
building of them.  Such as they are we must work with them, it at all.

   If  we  have become aroused from the usual lethargy and  are  anxious  to
progress, the question naturally arises, What must I do?

   Without well-kept tools the mechanic can do no effective work; similarly,
the instruments of the Ego must be cleansed and sharpened;  then we may com-
mence  work to some purpose.   As one works with those wonderful tools  they
themselves improve with proper use and become more and more efficient to aid
in the work.  The object of this work is Union with the Higher Self.

   There  are three steps by which this work conquers the lower nature,  but
they are not completely taken one after the other.   In a certain sense they
go together, so that at the present stage the first receives the most atten-
tion, the second less, and the third least of  all.  In time, when the first


[PAGE 433]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

step  has  been wholly taken,  naturally more attention can be paid  to  the
other two.

   There are three helps given in attaining these three stages.  They can be
seen in the outside world,  where the great Leaders of humanity have  placed
them.

   The  first help is Race religions, which by aiding humanity  to  overcome
the desire body, prepare it for union with the Holy Spirit.

   The full operation of this help was seen on the Day of Pentecost.  As the
Holy Spirit is the Race God,  all languages are expressions of it.   That is
why the apostles,  when fully united and filled with the Holy Spirit,  spoke
with  different  tongues  and were able to convince  their  hearers.   Their
desire  bodies had been sufficiently purified to bring about the  wished-for
union  and this is an earnest of what the disciple will one day attain  to--
the  power  to speak all tongues.   It may also be cited as a  modern,  his-
torical example, that the Comte de St. Germain (who was one of the later in-
carnations  of Christian Rosenkreuz the founder of our sacred Order),  spoke
all languages,  so that all to whom he spoke thought he belonged to the same
nation as they.  He also had achieved union with the Holy Spirit.

   In the Hyperborean Epoch,  before man possessed a desire body,  there was
but one universal mode of communication and when the desire body has  become
sufficiently purified, all men will again be able to understand one another,
for then the separative Race differentiation will have passed away.

   The  second help which humanity now has is the Religion of  the  Son--the
Christian religion, the object of which is UNION WITH CHRIST by purification
and control of the vital body.


[PAGE 434]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Paul refers to this future state when he says:   "Until Christ be  formed
in you,"  and exhorts his followers,  as men who are running a race,  to rid
themselves of every weight.

   The fundamental principle in building the vital body is repetition.   Re-
peated  experiences work on it to create memory.   The Leaders of  humanity,
who  desired  to give us unconscious help by certain  exercises,  instituted
prayer  as a means of bringing pure and lofty thought to work on  the  vital
body,  and enjoined us to "pray without ceasing."  Scoffers have often asked
sneeringly why it should be thought necessary to always pray, because if God
is omniscient He knows our needs and if He is not, our prayers will probably
never reach Him; and if not omniscient, He cannot be omnipotent,  and there-
fore  could not answer prayer in any case.   Many an earnest  Christian  may
also have thought it wrong to be continually importuning the Throne of
Grace.

   Such  ideas are founded upon a misunderstanding of facts.   Truly God  is
omniscient and requires no reminder of our needs, but if we pray aright,  we
lift ourselves up to Him,  thus working upon and purifying our vital bodies.
If  we pray aright--but that is the great trouble.   We are  generally  much
more concerned about temporal things than we are about spiritual upliftment.
Churches will hold special meetings to pray for rain!  and the chaplains  of
opposing  armies or navies will even pray before a battle that  success  may
follow their arms!

   That  is  prayer to the Race God, Who fights the battles of  His  people,
gives them increase of flocks and herds, fills their granaries and caters to
the material wants.  Such prayers are not even purifying.  They are from the
desire body, which sums up the situation thus:  Now Lord,  I am keeping your


[PAGE 435]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

commandments to the best of my ability and I want You to do Your part in re-
turn.

   Christ  gave  to  humanity a prayer that is,  like  himself,  unique  and
all-embracing.  In it there are seven distinct and separate prayers; one for
each  of  the seven principles of many--the threefold  body,  the  threefold
spirit and the link of mind.   Each prayer is peculiarly adapted to  promote
the progression of that part of composite man to which it refers.

   The purpose of the prayer relating to the threefold body is the  spiritu-
alization  of those vehicles and the extraction therefrom of  the  threefold
soul.

   The  prayers relating to the threefold spirit prepare it to  receive  the
extracted essence, the threefold soul.

   The prayer for the link of mind is to keep it in its proper relation as a
tie between the higher and the lower nature.

   The  third help to be given to humanity will be the Religion of  the  Fa-
ther.   We can have very little conception of what that will be,  save  that
the ideal will be even higher than Brotherhood and that by it the dense body
will be spiritualized.

   The Religions of the Holy Spirit,  the Race religions,  were for the  up-
lifting  of  the  human  race through a feeling  of  kinship  limited  to  a
group--family, tribe or nation.

   The purpose of the Religion of The Son, Christ, is to further uplift man-
kind by forming it into a Universal Brotherhood of separate individuals.

   The  ideal of the Religion of The Father will be the elimination  of  all
separateness, merging all into One, so that there will be no "I" nor "Thou,"
but  all will be One IN REALITY.   This will not come to pass while  we  are
still  inhabitants  of  the  physical  Earth, but in a future state where we


[PAGE 436]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

shall  realize our unity with all,  each having access to all the  knowledge
garnered by each separate individual.  Just as the single facet of a diamond
has access to all the light that comes through each of the other facets,  is
one  with them,  yet bounded by lines which give it a certain  individuality
WITHOUT SEPARATENESS, so will the individual spirit RETAIN THE MEMORY OF ITS
PARTICULAR EXPERIENCES,  while giving to all others THE FRUITS of its  indi-
vidual existence.

   These  are the steps and stages through which humanity  is  unconsciously
being led.

   In past ages the Race spirit reigned alone.   Man was content with a  pa-
triarchal and paternal government in which he had no part.  Now all over the
world we see signs of the breaking down of the old system.   The caste  sys-
tem, which was the stronghold of England in India, is crumbling.  Instead of
being separated into small groups, the people are uniting in the demand that
the oppressor shall depart and leave them to live in freedom under a govern-
ment of, by and for the people.  Russia is torn by strife for freedom from a
dictatorial,  autocratic government.   Turkey has awakened and taken a  long
stride toward liberty.  Here in our own land, where we are supposed to be in
the  actual enjoyment of such liberty as others are,  as yet,  only able  to
covet or fight for,  we are not yet satisfied.   We are learning that  there
are other oppressions than those of an autocratic monarchy.   We see that we
have still industrial freedom to gain.  We are chafing under the yoke of the
trusts  and  an  insane  system of  competition.   We  are  trending  toward
co-operation, which is now practiced by the trusts within their own confines
for private profit.  We are desirous of a state of society where "they shall


[PAGE 437]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

sit  every man under his vine and under his fig tree;  and none  shall  make
them afraid."

   Thus,  all  over the world,  the old systems of paternal  government  are
changing.   Nations, as such, have had their day and are unwittingly working
toward Universal Brotherhood in accordance with the design of our  invisible
Leaders, who are none the less potent in shaping events because they are not
officially seated in the councils of nations.

   These  are  the slow means by which the different bodies of  humanity  at
large  are being purified,  but the aspirant to the higher  knowledge  works
CONSCIOUSLY to attain to these ends,  by well-defined methods,  according to
his constitution.

                     WESTERN METHODS FOR WESTERN PEOPLE.

   In  India,  certain methods under different systems of  Yoga,  are  used.
Yoga means Union and,  as in the West,  the object of the aspirant is  union
with  the Higher Self;  but to be efficacious,  the methods of seeking  that
union must differ.  The vehicles of a Hindu are very differently constituted
from those of a Caucasian.   The Hindus have lived for many,  many thousands
of  years in an environment and climate totally different from  ours.   They
have pursued a different method of thought and their civilization, though of
a  very  high order,  is different from ours in its effects.   Therefore  it
would be useless for us to adopt their methods, which are the outcome of the
highest occult knowledge and perfectly suited to them, but as unsuitable for
the people of the West as a diet of oats would be for a lion.

   For instance,  in some systems it is required that the yogi shall sit  in
certain positions, that particular cosmic currents may flow through his body


[PAGE 438]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

in  a  certain way to produce certain definite  results.   That  instruction
would be altogether useless for a Caucasian,  as he is absolutely impervious
to those currents, because of his way of living.  If he is to attain results
at all, he must work in harmony with the constitution of his vehicles.  That
is why the "Mysteries"  were established in different parts of Europe during
the  Middle Ages.   The Alchemists were deep students of the  higher  occult
science.   The popular belief that the object of their study and experiment-
ing was the transmutation of baser metals into gold,  was because they chose
that symbolic way of describing their true work, which was the transmutation
of the lower nature into spirit.   It was thus described to lull the  suspi-
cions of the priests,  without stating a falsehood.   The statement that the
Rosicrucians were a society devoted to the discovery and use of the  formula
for  the making of the "Philosopher's Stone" was and is true.   It  is  also
true that most people have handled and do often handle this wondrous  stone.
It is common, but of no avail to an but the individual who makes it for him-
self.  The formula is given in the esoteric training and a Rosicrucian is no
different in that respect from the occultist of any other school.   All  are
engaged in the making of this coveted stone,  each,  however,  using his own
methods,  as there are no two individuals alike and consequently really  ef-
fective work is always individual in its scope.

   All occult schools are divisible into seven,  as are the "Rays"  of Life,
the  virgin  spirits.   Each School or Order belongs to one of  these  seven
Rays,  as does each unit of our humanity.   Therefore any individual seeking
to unite with one of these occult groups, the "Brothers" in which do not be-
long to his Ray, cannot do so with benefit to himself.  The members of these


[PAGE 439]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

groups are brothers in a more intimate sense than are the rest of humanity.

   Perhaps if these seven Rays are compared to the seven colors of the spec-
trum, their relation to one another can be better understood.  For instance,
if a red ray were to ally itself with a green ray,  inharmony would  result.
The same principle applies to spirits.   Each must proceed with the group to
which  it belongs during manifestation,  yet they are all one.   As all  the
colors are contained in the white light,  but the refractive quality of  our
atmosphere seems to divide it into seven colors,  so the illusory conditions
of concrete existence cause the virgin spirits to seem grouped and this  ap-
parent grouping will abide while we are in this state.

   The  Rosicrucian Order was started particularly for those whose high  de-
gree of intellectual development caused them to repudiate the heart.  Intel-
lect imperiously demands a logical explanation of everything--the world mys-
tery,  the  questions  of life and death.   The reasons for  and  the  MODUS
OPERANDI of existence were not explained by the priestly injunction "not  to
seek to know the mysteries of God."

   To any man or woman who is blest,  or otherwise,  with such an  inquiring
mind it is of paramount importance that they shall receive all the  informa-
tion they crave, so that when the head is stilled, the heart may speak.  In-
tellectual knowledge is but a means to an end,  not the end itself.   There-
fore,  the  Rosicrucian purposes first of all to satisfy  the  aspirant  for
knowledge that everything in the universe is reasonable,  thus winning  over
the rebellious intellect.   When it has ceased to criticise and is ready  to
accept provisionally,  as PROBABLY true, statements which cannot be  immedi-
ately  verified,  then,  and  not  until  then,  will  esoteric  training be


[PAGE 440]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

effective  in developing the higher faculties whereby man passes from  faith
to first-hand knowledge.  Yet, even then it will be found that, as the pupil
progresses in first-hand knowledge and becomes able to investigate for  him-
self,  there are always truths ahead of him that he knows to be truths,  but
which he is not yet advanced sufficiently to investigate.

   The  pupil will do well to remember that nothing that is not logical  can
exist in the universe and that logic is the surest guide in all the  Worlds,
but he must not forget that his faculties are limited and that more than his
own powers of logical reasoning may be needed to solve a given problem,  al-
though  it may,  nevertheless,  be susceptible of full explanation,  but  by
lines of reasoning which are beyond the capacity of the pupil at that  stage
of  his  development.   Another point that must be borne  in  mind  is  that
unwavering confidence in the teacher is absolutely necessary.

   The  foregoing is recommended to the particular consideration of all  who
intend  taking the first steps toward the higher knowledge.   If the  direc-
tions given are followed at all,  they must be given full credence as an ef-
ficacious  means  to  accomplish  their  purpose.    To  follow  them  in  a
half-hearted manner would be of no avail whatever.   Unbelief will kill  the
fairest flower ever produced by the spirit.

   Work  on  the different bodies of man is carried on  synchronously.   One
body  cannot be influenced without affecting the others,  but the  principal
work may be done on any one of them.

   If  strict attention is paid to hygiene and diet,  the dense body is  the
one  principally affected,  but  at the same time there is also an effect on


[PAGE 441]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

the  vital body and the desire body for,  as purer and better materials  are
built  into the dense body,  the particles are enveloped in purer  planetary
ether and desire-stuff also,  therefore the planetary parts of the vital and
desire bodies become purer.   If attention is paid to food and hygiene only,
the personal vital and desire bodies may remain almost as impure as  before,
but it has become just a little easier to get into touch with the good  than
if gross food were used.

   On  the other hand if,  despite annoyances,  an equable temper is  culti-
vated, also literary and artistic tastes, the vital body will produce an ef-
fect  of  daintiness and fastidiousness in physical matters  and  will  also
engender ennobling feelings and emotions in the desire body.

   Seeking to cultivate the emotions also reacts upon the other vehicles and
helps to improve them.
[PAGE 441 cont'd]                             ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

                          THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION

   If we begin with the dense vehicle and consider the physical means avail-
able  to improve it and make it the best possible instrument for the  spirit
and afterward consider the spiritual means to the same end,  we shall be in-
cluding  all  the other vehicles as well;  therefore we  shall  follow  that
method.

   The first visible state of a human embryo is a small, globulous, pulpy or
jelly-like substance,  similar to albumen, or the white of an egg.   In this
pulpy  globule  various  particles  of  more  solid  matter  appear.   These
gradually  increase in bulk and density until they come in contact with  one
another.  The different points of contact are slowly modified into joints or
hinges  and  thus  a  distinct framework of solid  matter,  a  skeleton,  is
gradually formed.

   During  the formation of this framework the surrounding pulpy matter  ac-
cumulates  and  changes  in form until at length that degree of organization


[PAGE 442]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

develops which is known as a foetus.  This becomes larger, firmer,  and more
fully organized up to the time of birth, when the state of infancy begins.

   The same process of consolidation which commenced with the first  visible
stage of existence, still continues.  The being passes through the different
stages of infancy,  childhood, youth, manhood or womanhood, old age,  and at
last comes to the change that is called death.

   Each of these stages is characterized by an INCREASING DEGREE OF HARDNESS
AND SOLIDITY.

   There  is a gradual increase in density and firmness of the  bones,  ten-
dons,  cartilages, ligaments, tissues, membranes, the coverings and even the
very substance of the stomach, liver, lungs,  and other organs.   The joints
become  rigid and dry.   They begin to crack and grate when they are  moved,
because the synovial fluid,  which oils and softens them,  is diminished  in
quantity and rendered too thick and glutinous to serve that purpose.

   The  heart,  the  brain,  and the entire muscular  system,  spinal  cord,
nerves,  eyes, etc., partake of the same consolidating process, growing more
and  more  rigid.   Millions upon millions of the minute  capillary  vessels
which  ramify and spread like the branches of a tree throughout  the  entire
body,  gradually choke up and change into solid fibre, no longer pervious to
the blood.

   The larger blood vessels, both arteries and veins,  indurate,  lose their
elasticity,  grow  smaller,  and become incapable of carrying  the  required
amount of blood.   The fluids of the body thicken and become putrid,  loaded
with earthy matter.  The skin withers and grows wrinkled and dry.   The hair
falls  off  for  lack  of  oil.  The  teeth  decay  and drop out for lack of


[PAGE 443]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

gelatine.   The motor nerves begin to dry up and the movements of  the  body
become awkward and slow.   The senses fail;  the circulation of the blood is
retarded;  it stagnates and congeals in the vessels.  More and more the body
loses its former powers.  Once elastic, healthy, alert, pliable,  active and
sensitive,  it becomes rigid, slow, and insensible.  Finally, it dies of old
age.

   The question now arises,  What is the cause of this gradual  ossification
of the body, bringing rigidity, decrepitude, and death?

   From the purely physical standpoint, chemists seem to be unanimous in the
opinion  that it is principally an increase of phosphate of lime (bone  mat-
ter),  carbonate  of lime (common chalk), and sulphate of lime  (plaster  of
paris),  with occasionally a little magnesia and an insignificant amount  of
other earthy matters.

   The only difference between the body of old age and that of childhood  is
the greater density,  toughness and rigidity,  caused by the greater propor-
tion  of  calcareous,  earthy matter entering into the  composition  of  the
former.  The bones of a child are composed of three parts of gelatine to one
part of earthy matter.  In old age this proportion is reversed.  What is the
source of this death-dealing accumulation of solid matter?

   It  seems to be axiomatic that the entire body is nourished by the  blood
and  that everything contained in the body,  of whatever nature,  has  first
been in the blood.  Analysis shows that the blood holds earthy substances of
the same kind as the solidifying agents--and mark!--the ARTERIAL blood  con-
tains more earthy matter than the VENOUS blood.

   This is highly important.   It shows that in every cycle the blood depos-
its  earthy  substances.  It  is therefore the common carrier that chokes up


[PAGE 444]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the system.  But its supply of earthy matter must be replenished,  otherwise
it  could  not continue to do this.  Where does it renew  its  deadly  load?
There can be but one answer to that question--from the food and drink; there
is absolutely no other source.

   The food and drink which nourish the body must be, at the same time,  the
primary  source of the calcareous,  earthy matter which is deposited by  the
blood all over the system,  causing decrepitude and finally death.   To sus-
tain  physical life it is necessary that we eat and drink but as  there  are
many  kinds of food and drink,  it behooves us,  in the light of  the  above
facts, to ascertain, if possible, what kinds contain the smallest proportion
of destructive matter.   If we can find such food we can lengthen our  lives
and,  from an occult standpoint, it is desirable to live as long as possible
in  each  dense body,  particularly after a start has been made  toward  the
path.   So  many years are required to educate,  through childhood  and  hot
youth, each body inhabited, until the spirit can at last obtain some control
over  it,  that the longer we can retain a body that has become amenable  to
the spirit's promptings,  the better.  Therefore it is highly important that
the  pupil  partake of such food and drink only as will  deposit  the  least
amount  of hardening matter and at the same time keep the  excretory  organs
active.

   The  skin  and the urinary system are the saviors of man  from  an  early
grave.   Were it not that by their means,  most of the earthy  matter  taken
with our food is eliminated, no one would live ten years.

   It  has been estimated that ordinary,  undistilled spring water  contains
carbonate  and  other compounds of lime to such an extent that  the  average
quantity used each day by one person in the form of tea, coffee, soup, etc.,


[PAGE 445]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

would in forty years be sufficient to form a block of solid chalk or  marble
the size of a large man.   It is also a significant fact that although phos-
phate of lime is always found in the urine of adults, it is not found in the
urine of children, because in them the rapid formation of bone requires that
this salt be retained.   During the period of gestation there is very little
earthy  matter in the urine of the mother, as it is used in the building  of
the foetus.   In ordinary circumstances, however, earthy matter is very much
in evidence in the urine of adults and to this we owe the fact that physical
life reaches even its present length.

   Undistilled water, when taken internally, is man's worst enemy,  but used
externally,  it  becomes his best friend.   It keeps the pores of  the  skin
open, induces circulation of the blood and prevents the stagnation which af-
fords  the best opportunity for the depositing of the earthy,  death-dealing
phosphate of lime.

   Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the blood, said that health de-
notes a free circulation and disease is the result of an obstructed circula-
tion of the blood.

   The  bathtub  is  a great aid in keeping up the health of  the  body  and
should  be  freely used by the aspirant to the higher  life.   Perspiration,
sensible and insensible, carries more earthy matter out of the body than any
other  agency.   As  long as fuel is supplied and the fire  kept  free  from
ashes,  it will burn.   The kidneys are important in carrying away the ashes
from  the body,  but despite the great amount of earthy matter carried  away
by the urine,  enough remains in many cases to form gravel and stone in  the
bladder, causing untold agony and often death.

   Let  no one be deceived into thinking that water contains less stone  be-
cause  it  has  been  boiled.  The  stone  that  forms  on the bottom of the


[PAGE 446]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

teakettle has been left there by the evaporated water which escaped from the
kettle as  steam.   If  the  steam were condensed,  we should have distilled
water, which is an important adjunct in keeping the body young.

   There is absolutely no earthy matter in distilled water,  nor in rain wa-
ter,  snow nor hail (except what may be gathered by contact with house-tops,
etc.), but coffee, tea, or soup made with ordinary water, no matter how long
boiled, is not purified of the earthy particles; on the contrary, the longer
they are boiled, the more heavily charged with ash they become.   Those suf-
fering from urinary diseases should never drink any but distilled water.

   It may be said generally of the solid foods we take into our system, that
fresh  vegetables and ripe fruits contain the greatest proportion of  nutri-
tious matter and the least of earthy substances.

   As  we  are writing for the aspirant to the higher life and not  for  the
general  public,  it may also be said that animal food  should  be  entirely
avoided,  if possible.   No one who kills can go very far along the path  of
holiness.   We  do even worse than if we actually killed,  for in  order  to
shield  ourselves  from the personal commission of the act of  killing,  and
still reap its results, we force a fellow being, through economic necessity,
to devote his entire time to murder, thereby brutalizing him to such an  ex-
tent  that the law will not allow him to act as a juror in cases of  capital
crime, because his business has so familiarized him with the taking of life.

   The  enlightened know the animals to be their younger brothers  and  that
they  will be human in the Jupiter Period.   We shall then help them as  the
Angels,  who  were  human in the Moon Period, are now helping us, and for an

aspirant to high ideals to kill--either in person or by proxy--is out of the
question.

   Several very important food products from animals,  such as milk,  cheese
and butter, may be used.  These are the results of the PROCESSES of life and
require no tragedies to convert them into food.  Milk, which is an important
food  for the occult student,  contains no earthy matter of any  consequence
and has an influence upon the body possessed by no other food.

   During  the Moon Period man was fed upon the milk of  Nature.   Universal
food  was absorbed by him and the use of milk has a tendency to put  him  in
touch with the Cosmic forces and enable him to heal others.

   It is popularly supposed that sugar or any saccharine substance is  inju-
rious to the general health,  and particularly to the teeth,  causing  their
decay and the resulting toothache.  Only under certain circumstances is this
true.  It is harmful in certain diseases, such as biliousness and dyspepsia,
or  if held long in the mouth as candy,  but if sparingly used  during  good
health and the amount gradually increased as the stomach becomes  accustomed
to its use, it will be found very nourishing.  The health of negroes becomes
greatly improved during the sugar-cane harvest time,  nothwithstanding their
increased labor.   This is attributed solely to their fondness for the sweet
cane-juice.   The same may be said of horses,  cows,  and other  animals  in
those localities, which are all fond of the refuse syrup fed to them.   They
grow  fat in harvest time,  their coats becoming sleek and shining.   Horses
fed  on boiled carrots for a few weeks will get a coat like silk,  owing  to
the saccharine juices of that vegetable.  Sugar is a nutritious and  benefi-
cial article of diet and contains no ash whatever.

   Fruits are an ideal diet.   They are in fact evolved by the trees to  in-
duce  animal and man to eat them,  so that the seed may be disseminated,  as
flowers entice bees for a similar purpose.

   Fresh fruit contains water of the purest and best kind, capable of perme-
ating the system in a marvelous manner.   Grape juice is a particularly won-
derful  solvent.   It thins and stimulates the blood,  opening the way  into
capillaries  already  dried and choked up--if the process has not  gone  too
far.   By a course of unfermented grape-juice treatment,  people with sunken
eyes,  wrinkled skins and poor complexions become plump,  ruddy and  lively.
The  increased permeability enables the spirit to manifest more  freely  and
with renewed energy.   The following table, which with the exception of  the
last column,  is taken from the publications of the United States Department
of Agriculture,  will give the aspirant some idea of the amount it is neces-
sary to eat for different degrees of activity,  also the constituents of the
various foods named.

   Considering  the body from a purely physical standpoint,  it is  what  we
might call a chemical furnace,  the food being the fuel.   The more the body
is exercised,  the more fuel it requires.   It would be foolish for a man to
change  an ordinary diet which for years had adequately nourished  him,  and
take  up a new method without due thought as to which would be the best  for
serving  his purpose.   To simply eliminate meats from the ordinary diet  of
meat-eaters would unquestionably undermine the health of most persons.   The
only  safe  way is to experiment and study the matter out first,  using  due
discrimination.   No fixed rules can be given,  the matter of diet being  as
individual as any other characteristic.  All that can be done is to give the
table  of  food  values  and describe the general influence of each chemical


[PAGE 449]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

chemical element, allowing the aspirant to work out his own method.

   Neither must we allow the appearance of a person to influence our  judge-
ment  as  to the condition of his health.   Certain general ideas of  how  a
healthy person should look are commonly accepted, but there is no valid rea-
son  for so judging.   Ruddy cheeks might be an indication of health in  one
individual and of disease in another.   There is no particular rule by which
good health can be known except the feeling of comfort and well-being  which
is enjoyed by the individual himself, irrespective of appearances.

   The table of foods here given deals with five chemical compounds.

   Water is the great solvent.

   Nitrogen or proteid is the essential builder of flesh,  but contains some
earthy matter.

   Carbo-hydrates or sugars are the principal power-producers.

   Fats are the producers of heat and the storers of reserve force.

   Ash is mineral,  earthy,  and chokes the system.  We need have no fear of
not  obtaining it in sufficient quantities to build the bones;  on the  con-
trary, we cannot be too careful to get as little as possible.

   The  calorie is the simple unit of heat,  and the table shows the  number
contained in each article of food when bought at the market.   In a pound of
Brazil nuts, for instance, 49.6% of the whole is waste (shells), but the re-
maining  50.4% contains 1485 calories.   That means that about  one-half  of
what is bought is waste,  but the remainder contains the number of  calories
named.   That  we may get the greatest amount of strength from our  food  we
must  pay  attention to the number of calories it contains, for from them we

obtain  the  energy  required  to perform our daily  work.   The  number  of
calories necessary to sustain the body under varying conditions is shown  in
the following table (per day):

Man at VERY hard muscular work...........................5500 Calories
Man at moderately hard muscular work.....................4150 Calories
Man at moderately active muscular work...................3400 Calories
Man at moderately LIGHT work.............................3050 Calories
Man at sedentary work....................................2700 Calories
Man without muscular exercise............................2450 Calories
Woman at light to moderate manual work...................2450 Calories

   According to this table,  it is evident that chocolate is the most nutri-
tious food we have; also that cocoa, in its powdered state, is the most dan-
gerous of all foods,  containing three times as much as as most of the  oth-
ers,  and  ten  times as much as many.  It is a powerful  food  and  also  a
powerful  poison,  for  it chokes the system more  quickly  than  any  other
substance.

   Of course,  it will require some study at first to secure the best  nour-
ishment, but it pays in health and longevity and secures the free use of the
body, making study and application to higher things possible.  After a while
the  aspirant will become so familiar with the subject that he will need  to
give it no particular attention.

   While  the  foregoing table shows the proportion of  chemical  substances
contained in each article of food named, it must be remembered that not  all
of this is available for use in the system,  because there are certain  por-
tions which the body refuses to assimilate.

   Of vegetables,  we digest only about 83% of the proteids, 90% of the fat,
and 95% of the carbo-hydrates.

   Of fruits,  we assimilate about 85% of the proteids, 90% of the fat,  and
90% of the carbo-hydrates.

   The  brain  is the co-ordinating mechanism whereby the movements  of  the
body  are controlled and our ideas are expressed.   It is built of the  same
substances as are all other parts of the body, with the addition of phospho-
rus, which is peculiar to the brain alone.  (As to proportion.--Ed.)

   The  logical conclusion is that phosphorus is the particular  element  by
means  of which the Ego is able to express thought and influence  the  dense
physical body.   It is also a fact that the proportion and variation of this
substance  is found to correspond to the state and stage of intelligence  of
the  individual.  Idiots  have  very little phosphorus; shrewd thinkers have


[PAGE 453]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

much;  and in the animal world, the degree of consciousness and intelligence
is in proportion to the amount of phosphorus contained in the brain.

   It  is therefore of great importance that the aspirant who is to use  his
body  for mental and spiritual work,  should supply his brain with the  sub-
stance  necessary for that purpose.   Most vegetables and fruits  contain  a
certain  amount of phosphorus,  but it is a peculiar fact that  the  greater
proportion is contained in the leaves, which are usually thrown away.  It is
found in considerable quantities in grapes,  onions,  sage,  beans,  cloves,
pineapples,  in  the  leaves  and stalks of many  vegetables,  and  also  in
sugar-cane juice, but not in refined sugar.

   The following table shows the proportions of phosphoric acid in a few ar-
ticles:

100,000 Parts of:

Barley, dry, contain, of phosphoric acid,....................210 parts
Beans........................................................292 parts
Beets........................................................167 parts
Beets, Leaves of ............................................690 parts
Buckwheat....................................................170 parts
Carrots, dry.................................................395 parts

Peas.........................................................190 parts

   The gist of the preceding argument may be thus succinctly stated:

   (1)  The body, throughout the entire period of life, is subject to a pro-
cess of consolidation.

   (2)  This process consists of the depositing by the blood  of earthy sub-
stances, principally phosphate and carbonate of lime,  by  which the various
parts become ossified, converted into bone, or kindred matter.


[PAGE 454]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   (3)   This conversion into bone destroys the flexibility of the  vessels,
muscles  and  other parts of the body subject to motion.   It  thickens  the
blood and entirely chokes up the minute capillaries, so that the circulation
of the fluids and the action of the system generally diminishes,  the termi-
nation of this process being death.

   (4)  This process of consolidation may be retarded and life prolonged  by
carefully avoiding the foods that contain much ash; by using distilled water
for internal purposes;  and by promotion excretion through the skin by means
of frequent baths.

   The foregoing explains why some religions prescribe frequent ablutions as
a religious exercise,  because they promote the health and purify the  dense
body.   Fastings were also prescribed for the same purpose.   They give  the
stomach a much needed rest,  allow the body to eliminate the EFFETE  matter,
and thus, if not too frequent or too prolonged, promote the health, but usu-
ally  as much and more can be accomplished by giving the body  proper  foods
which are the best medicines.

   Always the first care of the physician is to ascertain if there is proper
excretion,  that being Nature's chief means for ridding the body of the poi-
sons contained in all foods.

   In  conclusion,  let the aspirant choose such food as is most easily  di-
gested, for the more easily the energy in food is extracted, the longer time
will the system have for recuperation before it becomes necessary to replen-
ish the supply.   Milk should never be drunk as one may drink a glass of wa-
ter.  Taken in that way, it forms in the stomach a large cheese ball,  quite
impervious to the action of the gastric juices.  It should be sipped,  as we
sip  tea or coffee.   It will then form many small globules in the  stomach,
which are easily assimilated.  Properly used, it is one of the best possible


[PAGE 455]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

articles of diet.  Citrus fruits are powerful antiseptics, and cereals, par-
ticularly rice, are antitoxins of great efficiency.

   Having  now explained,  from the purely material point of view,  what  is
necessary for the dense body,  we will consider the subject from the  occult
side, taking into consideration the effect on the two invisible bodies which
interpenetrate the dense body.

   The  particular stronghold of the desire body is in the muscles  and  the
cerebro-spinal nervous system,  as already shown.  The energy displayed by a
person when laboring under great excitement or anger is an example of  this.
At such times the whole muscular system is tense and no hard labor is so ex-
hausting as a "fit of temper."   It sometimes leaves the body prostrated for
weeks.   There  can be seen the necessity for improving the desire  body  by
controlling the temper,  thus sparing the dense body the suffering resulting
from the ungoverned action of the desire body.

   Looking at the matter from an occult standpoint, all consciousness in the
Physical World is the result of the constant war between the desire and  the
vital bodies.

   The tendency of the vital body is to soften and build.  Its chief expres-
sion is the blood and the glands, also the sympathetic nervous system,  hav-
ing  obtained ingress into the stronghold of the desire body  (the  muscular
and the voluntary nervous systems) when it began to develop the heart into a
voluntary muscle.

   The tendency of the desire body is to harden,  and it in turn has invaded
the realm of the vital body, gaining possession of the spleen and making the
white blood corpuscles, which are not "the policement of the system" as sci-
ence now thinks,  but destroyers.  It uses the blood to carry these tiny de-
stroyers  all  over  the  body.  They pass through the walls of arteries and


[PAGE 456]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

veins  whenever annoyance is felt,  and especially in times of great  anger.
Then  the  rush of forces in the desire body makes the  arteries  and  veins
swell  and  opens the way for the passage of the white corpuscles  into  the
tissues of the body, where they form bases for the earthy matter which kills
the body.

   Given the same amount and kind of food,  the person of serene and  jovial
disposition will live longer,  enjoy better health,  and be more active than
the person who worries,  or loses his temper.  The latter will make and dis-
tribute through his body more destructive white corpuscles than the  former.
Were a scientist to analyze the bodies of these two men,  he would find that
there was considerably less earthy matter in the body of the kindly disposed
man than in that of the scold.

   This  destruction is constantly going on and it is not possible  to  keep
all the destroyers out,  nor is such the intention.   If the vital body  had
uninterrupted sway,  it would build and build, using all the energy for that
purpose.   There would be no consciousness and thought.   It is because  the
body checks and hardens the inner parts that consciousness develops.

   There was a time in the far, far past when we set out the concretions, as
do the mollusks,  leaving the body soft, flexible and boneless,  but at that
time  we had only the dull, glimmering consciousness the mollusks now  have.
Before we could advance,  it became necessary to retain the concretions  and
it  will be found that the stage of consciousness of any species is in  pro-
portion to the development of the bony framework WITHIN.   The Ego must have
the solid bones with the semi-fluid red marrow, in order to be able to build
the red blood corpuscles for its expression.


[PAGE 457]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE


   That is the highest development of the dense body.   It signifies nothing
in  this connection that the highest class of animals have an internal  bone
formation similar to man's,  but still have no indwelling spirit.   They be-
long to a different stream of evolution.

                          THE LAW OF ASSIMILATION.

   The  law of assimilation allows no particle to be built into  our  bodies
that we,  as spirits, have not overcome and made subject to ourselves.   The
forces active along these lines are, as we remember, principally our "dead,"
who  have  entered "heaven"  and are learning there to build bodies  to  use
here,  but they work according to certain laws that they cannot  circumvent.
There  is life in every particle of food that we take into our  bodies,  and
before  we can build that life into our bodies by the process  of  assimila-
tion,  we must overcome and make it subject to ourselves.   Otherwise  there
could be no harmony in the body.  All parts would act independently, as they
do  when the co-ordinating life has been withdrawn.   That would be what  we
call decay,  the process of disintegration, which is the direct opposite  of
assimilation.   The more individualized is the particle to  be  assimilated,
the  more energy will it require to digest it and the shorter time  will  it
remain before seeking to reassert itself.

   Human  beings are not organized in such a manner that they can live  upon
solid minerals.  When a purely mineral substance, such as salt, is eaten, it
passes  through the body leaving behind it but very little waste.   What  is
does leave,  however, is of a very injurious character.  If it were possible
for  man to use minerals as food,  they would be ideal for that purpose  be-
cause  of  their  stability  and  the little energy required to overcome and


[PAGE 458]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

subject  them to the life of the body.   We should be compelled to eat  very
much less in quantity and also less often than we now do.   Our laboratories
will some time supply us with chemical food of a quality far surpassing any-
thing that we now have, which shall be always fresh.  Food obtained from the
higher  plans  and  still  more  from the  yet  higher  animal  kingdom,  is
positively  nauseating because of the rapidity of decay.   This  process  is
caused  by the efforts made by the individual particles to escape  from  the
composite whole.

   The plant kingdom is next above the mineral.   It has an organization ca-
pable  of assimilating the mineral compounds of the Earth.   Man and  animal
can  assimilate the plants and thus obtain the chemical compounds  necessary
to  sustain  their bodies and as the consciousness of the plant  kingdom  is
that of dreamless sleep,  it offers no resistance.   It requires but  little
energy to assimilate the particles thus derived and having small individual-
ity of their own,  the life ensouling the particles does not seek to  escape
from  our  body as soon as food derived from more  highly  developed  forms,
therefore  the strength derived from a diet of fruit and vegetables is  more
enduring  than that derived from a meat diet,  and the food supply does  not
require  as frequent replenishing,  besides giving more strength in  propor-
tion, because less energy is required for assimilation.

   Food  composed of the bodies of animals consists of particles which  have
been worked upon and inter-penetrated by an individual desire body, and have
thus been individualized to a much greater extent than the plant  particles.
There is an individual cell soul, which is permeated by the passions and de-
sires of the animal.  It requires  considerable energy to overcome it in the


[PAGE 459]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

first place,  so that it may be assimilated,  yet it never becomes so  fully
incorporated into the polity of the body as do the plant constituents, which
have no such strong individual tendencies.   The result is that is is neces-
sary  for  the flesh-eater to consume a greater weight of food than  is  re-
quired by the fruitarian; also he must eat oftener.   Moreover,  this inward
strife of the particles of flesh causes greater wear and tear of the body in
general,  rendering the meat-eater less active and capable of endurance than
the  vegetarian,  as all contests between advocates of the two methods  have
demonstrated.

   Therefore, when flesh food derived from the herbivora is such an unstable
diet,  it is evident that if we should try to use the flesh  of  carnivorous
animals,  in which the cells are still further individualized,  we would  be
forced  to  consume enormous quantities of food.   Eating would  occupy  the
greater part of our time, but notwithstanding that fact,  we would always be
lean and hungry.   That such is its effect, can be seen in the wolf and  the
vulture;  their  leanness and hunger are proverbial.   Cannibals  eat  human
flesh,  but only at long intervals and as a luxury.  As man does not confine
himself  exclusively to a meat diet,  his flesh is not that of  an  entirely
carnivorous beast,  nevertheless the hunger of the cannibal has also  become
the burden of a proverb.

   If the flesh of the herbivora were the essence of what is good in plants,
then, logically, the flesh of the carnivora should be the quintessence.  The
meat of wolves and vultures would thus be the CREME DE LA CREME, and much to
be  desired.   This we know is not the case,  but quite  the  reverse.   The
nearer  we  get to the plant kingdom, the more strength we derive  from  our
food.  If the reverse were the case,  the flesh of carnivorous animals would


[PAGE 460]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

be sought by other beasts of prey,  but examples of "dog eat dog"  are  very
few throughout nature.

                             LIVE AND LET LIVE.

   The first law of occult science is "Thou shalt not kill," and that should
have  the greatest weight with the aspirant to the higher life.   We  cannot
create so much as one particle of dust,  therefore what right have we to de-
stroy the very least form?   All Form is an expression of the One  Life--the
Life of God.  We have no right to destroy the Form through which the Life is
seeking experience, and force it to build a new vehicle.

   Ella Wheeler Wilcox,  with the true compassion of all far advanced souls,
champions this occult maxim, in the following beautiful words:

         I am the voice of the voiceless;
         Through me the dumb shall speak
         Till a deaf world's ear
         Shall be made to hear
         The wrongs of the wordless weak.

         The same force formed the sparrow
         That fashioned man, the king.
         The God OF THE WHOLE

         Gave a spark of soul
         To furred and feathered thing.

         And I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER;
         And I will fight his fight,
         And speak the word
         For beast and bird
         Till the world shall set things right.

   Sometimes  the objection is made that life is also taken when  vegetables
and fruits are eaten,  but that statement is based upon a complete misunder-
standing of the facts.  When the fruit is ripe, it has accomplished its pur-
pose, which is to act as a womb for the ripening of the seed.  If not eaten,


[PAGE 461]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

it decays and goes to waste.   Moreover, it is designed to serve as food for
the  animal and human kingdoms,  thus affording the seed  opportunities  for
growth by scattering it in fertile soil.  Besides,  just as the ovum and the
semen of human beings are ineffectual without the seed-atom of the  reincar-
nating Ego and the matrix of its vital body, so any egg or seed,  of itself,
is  devoid of life.   If it is given the proper conditions of  incubator  or
soil, the life of the group spirit is then poured into it, thus grasping the
opportunity  so afforded of producing a dense body.   If the egg or seed  is
cooked, crushed, or not given the conditions necessary for the life, the op-
portunity is lost, but that is all.

   At the present stage of the evolutionary journey,  everyone knows  inher-
ently that it is wrong to kill and man will love and protect the animals  in
all  cases where his greed and selfish interest does not blind him to  their
rights.   The law protects even a cat or a dog against WANTON cruelty.   Ex-
cept  in "sport,"  that most wanton of all our cruelties against the  animal
creation,  it is always for the sake of money that animals are murdered  and
bred to be murdered.  By the devotees of "sport"  the helpless creatures are
shot down to no purpose save to bolster up a false idea of prowess upon  the
part of the huntsman.  It is hard to understand how people who appear other-
wise sane and kindly can,  for the time,  trample upon all their gentler in-
stincts  and revert to bloodthirsty savagery, killing for the sheer lust  of
blood  and joy in destruction.   It is certainly a reversion to  the  lowest
savage animal instincts,  and can never be dignified into the remotest  sem-
blance of anything "manly", even though practiced and defended by the other-
wise humane and worthy temporary head of a mighty nation.

   How  much more beautiful it would be for man to play the role  of  friend
and protector of the weak.   Who does not love to visit Central Park in  New
York City and pet,  stroke and feed the hundreds of squirrels which are run-
ning about secure in the knowledge that they will not be molested?   And who
is not glad,  for the sake of the squirrels,  to see the sign,  "Dogs  found
chasing the squirrels will be shot."  This is hard on the dogs, but is is to
be commended as an evidence of the growth of the sentiment favoring the pro-
tection of the weak against the unreasoning or merciless strong.  Nothing is
said  on  the sign about the squirrels being injured by  men,  because  that
would  be unthinkable.   So strong is the influence of the trust the  little
animals repose in the kindness of man, that no one would violate it.

                              THE LORD'S PRAYER

   Returning  to our consideration of the spiritual aids to human  progress,
the Lord's Prayer, which may be considered as an abstract,  algebraical for-
mula  for  the upliftment and purification of all the vehicles of  man,  the
idea  of  taking proper care of the dense body is expressed  in  the  words:
"Give us this day our daily bread."

   The prayer dealing with the needs of the vital body is,  "Forgive us  our
trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us."

   The vital body is the seat of memory.  In it are stored the sub-conscious
records of all the past events of our life, good or ill, including all inju-
ries inflicted or sustained and benefits received, or bestowed.  We remember
that  the record of the life is taken from those pictures immediately  after
leaving the dense body at death,  and that all the sufferings of POST MORTEM


[PAGE 463]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

existence are the results of the events these pictures portray.

   If,  by continual prayer,  we obtain forgiveness for the injuries we have
inflicted  upon others and if we make all the restitution  possible,  purify
our vital bodies by forgiving those who have wronged us,  and eliminate  all
ill feeling,  we save ourselves much POST MORTEM misery,  besides  preparing
the way for Universal Brotherhood,  which is particularly dependent upon the
victory of the vital body over the desire body.  In the form of memory,  the
desire body impresses upon the vital body the idea of revenge.  An even tem-
per  amid  the various annoyances of daily life indicates  such  a  victory,
therefore  the aspirant should cultivate control of the temper,  as  it  in-
cludes work on both bodies.  The Lord's Prayer includes this also,  for when
we see that we are injuring others, we look about and try to find the cause.
Loss of temper is one of the causes and it originates in the desire body.

   Most people leave physical life with the same temperament they bring into
it,  but the aspirant must systematically conquer all attempts of the desire
body to assume mastery.  That can be done by concentration upon high ideals,
which strengthens the vital body and is much more efficacious than the  com-
mon prayers of the Church.  The OCCULT SCIENTIST uses concentration in pref-
erence to prayer, because the former is accomplished by the aid of the mind,
which is cold and unfeeling,  whereas prayer is usually dictated by emotion.
Where  it is dictated by a pure unselfish devotion to high ideals prayer  is
much higher than cold concentration.   It can never be cold,  but bears upon
the pinions of Love the outpourings of the mystic to the Deity.

   The prayer for the desire body is, "Lead us not into temptation."  Desire


[PAGE 464]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

is the great tempter of mankind.   It is the great incentive to all  action,
and  in  so far as the actions subserve the purposes of the  spirit,  it  is
good;  but where the desire is for something degrading,  something that  de-
bases the nature,  it is indeed meet that we pray not to be led into tempta-
tion.

   Love, Wealth, Power, and Fame!--These are the four great motives of human
action.  Desire for one or more of these is the motive for all that man does
or leaves undone.   The great Leaders of humanity have wisely given them  as
incentives to action, that man may gain experience and learn thereby.   They
are necessary,  and the aspirant may safely continue to use them as  motives
for action, but he must transmute them into something higher.  He must over-
come  with nobler aspirations the selfish love which seeks the ownership  of
another body, and all desires for wealth, power and fame for narrow and per-
sonal reasons.

   The Love for which he must long is that only which is of the soul and em-
braces all beings,  high and low,  increasing in proportion to the needs  of
the recipient;

   The Wealth,  that which consists solely of abundance of opportunities  to
serve his fellow men;

   The Power, that alone which makes for the upliftment of humanity;

   The Fame,  none save that which increases his ability to spread the  good
news,  that  all  who suffer may thus quickly find solace  for  the  heart's
grief.

   The  prayer for the mind is "Deliver us from evil."   We have  seen  that
mind is the link between the higher and the lower natures.  Animals are per-
mitted  to  follow  desire without any restriction whatever.  In their case,

[PAGE 465]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE


there is neither good nor evil, because they lack mind,  the faculty of dis-
crimination.   The  method of self-protection which we pursue in  regard  to
animals which kill and steal is different from that which we use in relation
to human beings who do the same things.  Even a human being who is bereft of
mind is not held accountable.   The fact is recognized that he does not know
he is doing wrong, therefore he is simply restrained.

   It  was only when his mental eyes were opened that man came to know  good
and evil.   When the link of mind becomes allied to the Higher Self and does
its bidding, we have the high-minded person.  On the contrary, the coalition
of  the  mind with the lower desire nature produces the  low-minded  person;
therefore  the meaning of this prayer is that we may be delivered  from  the
experience  resulting  from the alliance of the mind with the  desire  body,
with all thereby implied.

   The aspirant to the higher life accomplishes the union of the higher  and
the lower natures by means of Meditation on lofty subjects.   This union  is
further cemented by Contemplation,  and both these states are transcended by
Adoration, which lifts the spirit to the very Throne.

   The Lord's Prayer, given for the general use of the Church,  gives Adora-
tion  first place,  in order to reach the spiritual exaltation necessary  to
proffer a petition representing the needs of the lower vehicles.   Each  as-
pect of the threefold spirit,  commencing with the lowest,  raises itself in
adoration to its corresponding aspect of Deity.   When the three aspects  of
the  spirit  are  all arrayed before the Throne of Grace,  each  utters  the
prayer appropriate to the needs of its material counterpart, all three join-
ing in the closing prayer for the mind.


[PAGE 466]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The  human spirit soars to its counterpart,  the Holy  Spirit  (Jehovah),
saying "Hallowed be Thy Name."

   The  life spirit bows before its counterpart,  The Son  (Christ),  saying
"Thy Kingdom Come."

   The  divine spirit kneels before its counterpart,  The Father,  with  the
prayer, "Thy Will be done."

   Then the highest,  the divine spirit, petitions the highest aspect of the
Deity,  the Father,  for its counterpart, the dense body:  "Give us this day
our daily bread."

   The next highest, the life spirit, prays to its counterpart, the Son, for
its counterpart in the lower nature, the vital body:   "Forgive us our tres-
passes as we forgive those who trespass against us."

   The lowest aspect of the spirit, the human spirit,  next offers its peti-
tion to the lowest aspect of Deity for the highest of the threefold  bodies,
the desire body:  "Lead us not into temptation."

   Lastly,  in unison, all three aspects of the threefold spirit in man join
in  the  most important of the prayers, the petition for the  mind,  in  the
words:  "Deliver us from evil."

   The introduction,  "Our Father Who art in Heaven,"  is merely as the  ad-
dress  on an envelope.   The addition,  "For Thine is the Kingdom,  and  the
Power,  and the Glory, forever.  Amen," was not given by Christ, but is very
appropriate  as the parting adoration of the threefold spirit as  it  closes
its direct address to the Deity.

   Diagram  16 illustrates the foregoing explanation in a simple and  easily
remembered manner,  showing the connection between the different prayers and
the corresponding vehicles,  which are similarly colored.   This diagram  is
inserted opposite page 464.


[PAGE 467]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

                            THE VOW OF CELIBACY.

   The sex-pervert, or sex-maniac, is a proof of the correctness of the con-
tention  of occultists that one part of the sex-force builds the brain.   He
becomes  an idiot,  unable to think because of drawing and sending out,  not
only  the negative or positive part of the sex force (according  to  whether
male  or  female)  which is normally to be used through  the  sex-organ  for
propagation,  but in addition to that,  some of the force which should build
up the brain, enabling it to produce thought--hence the mental deficiency.

   On the other hand, if the person is given to spiritual thought,  the ten-
dency to use the sex force for propagation is slight,  and whatever part  of
it is not used in that way may be transmuted into spiritual force.

   That is why the initiate,  at a certain stage of development,  takes  the
vow of celibacy.   It is not an easy vow, nor one to be lightly taken by one
desirous of spiritual advancement.  Many people who are not yet ripe for the
higher life have ignorantly bound themselves to a life of asceticism.   They
are  as dangerous to the community and to themselves on the one hand  as  is
the imbecile sex-maniac on the other.

   At  the  present stage of human evolution the sex function is  the  means
whereby bodies are provided,  through which the spirit can gain  experience.
The  people who are most prolific and follow the creative impulse  unreserv-
edly are the lowest classes;  thus it is difficult for incoming entities  to
find good vehicles amid environments enabling them to unfold their faculties
in such a manner as to permanently benefit themselves and the rest of human-
ity,  for  among  the  wealthier  classes  who  could furnish more favorable


[PAGE 468]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

conditions many have few or no children.  It is not because they live abste-
mious  sex-lives,  but for the entirely selfish reasons that they  may  have
more ease and leisure and indulge in unlimited sex-gratification without the
burden of a family.  Among the less wealthy middle class,  families are also
restricted,  but in their case partially for economic reasons, that they may
give  one or two children educational and other advantages that their  means
would not permit them to give to four or five.

   Thus  man exercises his divine prerogative of bringing disorder into  na-
ture.   Incoming Egos must take the opportunities offered them sometimes un-
der  unfavorable circumstances.   Other Egos who cannot do that,  must  wait
till favorable environment offers.  Thus do we affect one another by our ac-
tions and thus are the sins of the fathers visited upon the children, for as
the Holy Spirit is the creative energy in nature,  the sex energy is its re-
flection  in man,  and misuse or abuse of that power is the sin that is  not
forgiven,  but must be expiated in impaired efficiency of the  vehicles,  in
order to thoroughly teach us the sanctity of the creative force.

   Aspirants  to the higher life,  filled with an earnest desire to  live  a
noble spiritual life, often regard the sex-function with horror,  because of
the  harvest of misery which humanity has reaped as a result of  its  abuse.
They  are  apt  to  turn  in disgust from  what  they  regard  as  impurity,
overlooking  the fact that it is precisely such people as they  who  (having
brought their vehicles into good condition by means of proper sanitary food,
high  and lofty thought,  and pure and spiritual lives) are best  fitted  to
generate  the dense bodies essential to the development of entities  seeking
incarnation.  It  is  common  knowledge among occult scientists that, to the


[PAGE 469]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

detriment of the race,  many high class Egos are kept out of incarnation  at
the present time solely because parents cannot be found who are pure  enough
to provide them with the necessary physical vehicles.

   Persons  who,  for the reason above mentioned,  refrain from doing  their
duty to humanity,  are magnifying the sun spots to such an extent that  they
forget to see the Sun itself!   The sex function has its great place in  the
economy of the world.   When properly used, there is no greater boon to  the
Ego,  for it then provides pure and healthful bodies such as man  needs  for
his development; conversely, when abused, there is no greater curse,  for it
is then the source of the worst ills to which flesh is heir.

   It is a truism that "no man liveth unto himself."   By our words and acts
we are constantly affecting others.   By the proper performance,  or the ne-
glect of our duty,  we make or mar the lives, first, of those in our immedi-
ate  environment,  but ultimately of all the inhabitants of the  Earth,  and
more.   No one has a right to seek the higher life without having  performed
his duty to his family,  his country, and the human race.   To selfishly set
aside  everything else and live solely for one's own spiritual  advancement,
is as reprehensible as not to care for the spiritual life at all.   Nay,  it
is  worse;  for those who do their duty in the ordinary life to the best  of
their  ability,  devoting themselves to the welfare of those dependent  upon
them, are cultivating the essential quality of faithfulness.  They will cer-
tainly  advance  in  due time to a point where they  will  become  awake  to
spiritual necessities,  and will carry to that work the faithfulness  devel-
oped  elsewhere.   The man who deliberately turns his back upon his  present
duties  to  take up the spiritual life will surely be forced back  into  the
path  of  duty from which he has mistakenly diverged, with no possible means


[PAGE 470]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

of escape until the lesson has been learned.

   Certain  tribes of India make the following excellent division  of  life.
The first twenty years are spent in obtaining an education;  the years  from
20 to 40 are devoted to the duty of raising a family; and the remaining time
is devoted to spiritual development, without any physical cares to harass or
distract the mind.

   During the first period the child is supported by its parents; during the
second period the man,  in addition to supporting his own family,  cares for
his  parents  while they are giving their attention to  higher  things;  and
during the balance of his life, he is in turn supported by his children.

   This seems a very sensible method, and is quite satisfactory in a country
where all,  from the cradle to the grave,  feel the spiritual need,  to such
degree that they mistakenly neglect material development except as  impelled
by the lash of direst need,  and where the children cheerfully support their
parents,  secure  in the knowledge that they will be supported in  turn  and
thus be enabled to devote themselves entirely to the higher life after  hav-
ing performed their duty to their country and to humanity.   In the  Western
World,  however,  where no spiritual need is at present felt by the  average
man because he is properly following material lines of development,  such  a
mode of life would be impossible of realization.

   Spiritual desire never comes until the time is ripe,  and always when the
particular conditions obtain under which we must seek its gratification,  if
at  all.   Whatever  duties exist which are apparent  restrictions  must  be
borne.   If the care of a family prevents the complete consecration desired,
the  aspirant  would  certainly  not  be  justified  in  neglecting duty and


[PAGE 471]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE

devoting the entire time and energy to spiritual purposes.   An effort  must
be made to gratify such aspirations without interfering with duty to family.

   If  the desire to live a celibate life comes to a person who  holds  mar-
riage relations with another,  the obligations of such relations are not  to
be  forgotten.   It would be very wrong,  by practicing celibacy under  such
circumstances,  to endeavor to escape from the PROPER performance  of  duty.
As to what constitutes duty in regard to coition, however,  there is a stan-
dard  for aspirants to the higher life different from that of  the  ordinary
man or woman.

   Most  people  regard marriage as sanctioning unlimited  license  for  the
gratification of sexual desire.  In the eyes of statute law, perhaps it does
so, but no man-made law nor custom has any right to govern this matter.  Oc-
cult  science  teaches  that  the sex-function  should  NEVER  be  used  for
sense-gratification, but for propagation ONLY.  Therefore an aspirant to the
higher life would be justified in refusing coition with the marriage partner
unless the object were the begetting of a child,  and then only if both par-
ties were in perfect health--physically,  morally and mentally--as otherwise
the union would be likely to result in the generation of a feeble or  degen-
erate body.

   Each person owns his or her body, and is responsible to the law of Conse-
quence  for  any misuse resulting from the weak willed abandonment  of  that
body to another.

   In the light of the foregoing,  and looking at the matter from the  view-
point of occult science,  it is both a duty and a privilege (to be exercised
with  thanks  for the opportunity) for all persons who are  healthy  and  of
sound  mind to provide vehicles for as many entities as is  consistent  with
their  health  and ability to care for the same.  And, as previously stated,


[PAGE 472]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

most particularly are aspirants to the higher life under obligation in  this
respect, on account of the purification which their purer lives have wrought
in  their bodies,  because of which they are better qualified than  ordinary
humanity to generate pure vehicles.  Thus they enable high-class entities to
find suitable vehicles and help humanity to advance by affording these wait-
ing Egos opportunities to incarnate and exercise their influence at an  ear-
lier period than would otherwise be possible.

   If  the sex force is used in the way indicated,  coition will take  place
but  few times in a life,  and practically the entire sex force may be  used
for spiritual purposes.   It is not the use,  but the abuse that causes  all
the trouble and interferes with the spiritual life,  so there is no need for
anyone to abandon the higher life because he or she cannot be celibate.   It
is not necessary to be strictly celibate while going through the lesser Ini-
tiations.   The vow of absolute celibacy applies to the greater  Initiations
only,  and even then a single act of fecundation may sometimes be  necessary
as an act of sacrifice, as was the case in providing a body for Christ.

   It may also be said that it is worse to suffer from a burning desire,  to
be constantly thinking vividly of the gratification of sense,  than to  live
the married life in moderation.  Christ taught that unchaste thoughts are as
bad as,  and even worse than unchaste acts, because thoughts may be repeated
indefinitely, whereas there is at least some limit to acts.

   The  aspirant to the higher life can be successful only in proportion  to
the extent of the subjugation of the lower nature,  but should beware of the
other extreme.

                  THE PITUITARY BODY AND THE PINEAL GLAND.

   In the brain, and in approximately the positions shown in diagram 17, are
two  small organs called the pituitary body and the pineal  gland.   Medical
science  knows but little about these,  or the other ductless glands of  the
body.   It calls the pineal gland "the atrophied third eye,"  yet neither it
nor  the pituitary body are atrophying.  This is very perplexing  to  scien-
tists, for nature retains nothing useless.  All over the body we find organs
which are either atrophying or developing,  the former being milestones,  as
it were, along the path which man has traveled to reach his present stage of
development,  the latter pointing out the lines for future  improvement  and
development.   For instance,  the muscles which animals use to move the ears
are  present in man also,  but as they are atrophying,  few people  can  use
them.   The heart belongs to the class indicating future development; as al-
ready shown, it is becoming a voluntary muscle.

   The pituitary body and the pineal gland belong to still another class  of
organs, which at the present time are neither evolving nor degenerating, but
are  dormant.   In  the far past,  when man was in touch  with  the  "inner"
Worlds,  these organs were his means of ingress thereto, and they will again
serve that purpose at a later stage.   They were connected with the involun-
tary or sympathetic nervous system.   Man then saw the inner Worlds,  as  in
the Moon Period and the latter part of the Lemurian and early Atlantean  Ep-
ochs.   Pictures  presented themselves quite independent of his  will.   The
sense  centers  of his desire body were  spinning  around  counter-clockwise
(following negatively the motion of the Earth, which revolves on its axis in
that  direction)  as the sense centers of "mediums" do to this day.  In most


[PAGE 474]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

people these sense-centers are inactive,  but true development will set them
spinning clockwise,  as explained elsewhere.  That is the difficult  feature
in the development of positive clairvoyance.

   The development of mediumship is much easier,  because it is merely a re-
vival of the mirror-like function possessed by man in the far past, by which
the outside world was involuntarily reflected in him, and which function was
afterward  retained by inbreeding.   With present day mediums this power  is
intermittent,  which  explains  why they can sometimes "see"  and  at  other
times,  for no apparent reason, fail utterly.  Occasionally,  the strong de-
sire of the client enables them to get into touch with the information he is
seeking, on which occasions they see correctly, but they are not always hon-
est.   Office rent and other expenses must be paid,  so when the power (over
which they have no conscious control) fails them,  some resort to fraud  and
utter  any absurdity that occurs to their minds,  in order to satisfy  their
client  and get his money,  thus casting discredit upon what they really  do
see at other times.

   The  aspirate to true spiritual sight and insight must first of all  give
proof of unselfishness,  because the trained clairvoyant has no "off  days."
He is not in the least mirror-like, dependent upon the reflections which may
happen to come his way.   He is able to reach out at any time and in any di-
rection, and read the thoughts and plans of others, provided he particularly
turns his attention that way--not otherwise.

   The  great danger to society which would result from  the  indiscriminate
use of this power if possessed by an unworthy individual,  can be easily un-
derstood.  He  would be able to read the most secret thought.  Therefore the

initiate  is bound by the most solemn vows never to use this power to  serve
his individual interest in the slightest degree, nor to save himself a pang.
He  may feed five thousand others if he will,  but he must not turn a  stone
into bread to appease his own hunger.   He may heal others of palsy and lep-
rosy, but by the Law of the Universe, he is forbidden to stanch his own mor-
tal wounds.  Because he is bound by his vow of absolute unselfishness, it is
ever true of the Initiate that although he saves others,  himself he  cannot
save.

   So  the trained clairvoyant who really has something to give  will  never
hang out a sign offering to exercise his gifts for a fee,  but will give and
give freely where he considers it consistent with the ripe destiny generated
under the law of consequence by the person to be helped.

   Trained clairvoyance is the kind used for investigating occult facts, and
it is the only kind that is of any use for that purpose.   Therefore the as-
pirant must feel,  not a wish to gratify an idle curiosity,  but a holy  and
unselfish desire to help humanity.  Until such a desire exists,  no progress
can be made in the attainment of positive clairvoyance.

   In  the ages that have passed since the Lemurian Epoch humanity has  been
gradually  building the cerebro-spinal nervous system,  which is  under  the
control of the will.  In the latter part of the Atlantean Epoch, this was so
far  evolved that it became possible for the Ego to take full possession  of
the dense body.   That was the time (previously described) when the point in
the  vital body came into correspondence with the point at the root  of  the
nose  in  the  dense  body and the indwelling spirit  became  awake  in  the
Physical  World but,  so far as the greater part of humanity was  concerned,
lost consciousness of the inner Worlds.


[PAGE 477]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

   Since  then,  the connection of the pineal gland and the  pituitary  body
with the cerebro-spinal nervous system has been slowly building,  and is now
all but complete.

   To  regain contact with the inner Worlds, all that remains to be done  is
the  reawakening of the pituitary body and the pineal gland.   When that  is
accomplished, man will again possess the faculty of perception in the higher
worlds,  but on a grander scale than formerly, because it will be in connec-
tion  with the voluntary nervous system and therefore under the  control  of
his Will.   Through this inner perceptive facility all avenues of  knowledge
will  be opened to him and he will have at his service a means of  acquiring
information  compared with which all other methods of investigation are  but
child's play.

   The awakening of these organs is accomplished by Esoteric Training, which
we will now describe, as far as may be done in public.

                              ESOTERIC TRAINING

   In  the majority of people,  the greater part of the sex force which  may
legitimately   be  used  through  the  creative  organs  is   expended   for
sense-gratification;  therefore in such people there is very little  of  the
ascending current shown in diagram 17.

   When  the aspirant to the higher life begins to curb these excesses  more
and more, and to devote his attention to spiritual thoughts and efforts, the
trained clairvoyant can perceive the unused sex force commencing to  ascend.
It surges upward in stronger and stronger volume,  along the path  indicated
by the arrows in diagram 17, traversing the heart and the larynx or the spi-
nal cord and the larynx or both, and then passing directly between the pitu-
itary  body  and  the  pineal gland toward the dark point at the root of the


[PAGE 478]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

nose where "The Silent Watcher," the highest spirit, has its seat.

   These currents do not usually take one of the two paths indicated in  the
diagram  to  the entire exclusion of the other,  but generally one  path  is
traveled  by the greater volume of the sex-currents,  according to the  tem-
perament of the aspirant.   In one who is seeking enlightenment along purely
intellectual lines the current travels particularly over the spinal cord and
only a small part goes over the path through the heart.   In the mystic  who
feels  rather than knows,  the currents find their way upwards  through  the
heart.

   Both are developing abnormally, and each must sometime take up the devel-
opment  he  has neglected,  so as to become fully  rounded.   Therefore  the
Rosicrucians aim to give a teaching that will satisfy both classes, although
their  main efforts are expended in reaching the intellectually minded,  for
their need is the greater.

   This current of itself,  however,  even though it assumes the proportions
of a Niagara and flows until the crack of doom, will be useless.  But still,
as  it  is  not  only a necessary  accompaniment,  but  a  pre-requisite  to
self-conscious work in the inner World, it must be cultivated to some extend
before  the real esoteric training can begin.  It will thus be seen  that  a
moral life devoted to spiritual thought must be lived by the aspirant for  a
certain length of time before it is possible to commence the work that  will
give his first-hand knowledge of the super-physical realms and enable him to
become, in the truest sense, a helper of humanity.

   When the candidate has lived such a life for a time sufficient to  estab-
lish  the current of spiritual force,  and is found worthy and qualified  to
receive  esoteric  instruction,  he  is taught certain exercises, to set the


[PAGE 479]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

pituitary  body in vibration.   This vibration causes the pituitary body  to
impinge upon and slightly defect the nearest line of force (See diagram 17).
This, in turn, impinges upon the line next to it, and so the process contin-
ues until the force of the vibration has been spent.   It is similar to  the
way  in which the striking of one note on a piano will produce a  number  of
overtones,  by  setting  up a vibration in the other strings  which  are  at
proper intervals of pitch.

   When by the increased vibration of the pituitary body, the lines of force
have been deflected sufficiently to reach the pineal gland,  the object  has
been accomplished, the gap between these two organs has been bridged.   This
is the bridge between the World of Sense and the World of Desire.   From the
time it is built,  man becomes clairvoyant and able to direct his gaze where
he will.   Solid objects are seen both inside and out.  To him space and so-
lidity, as hindrances to observation, have ceased to exist.

   He is not yet a TRAINED clairvoyant,  but he IS a clairvoyant AT WILL,  a
voluntary clairvoyant.   He is a very different faculty from that  possessed
by  the medium,  who is usually an involuntary clairvoyant and can see  only
what comes;  or who has,  at best, very little more than the purely negative
faculty.  But the person in whom this bridge is once built is always in sure
touch  with the inner Worlds,  the connection being made and broken  at  his
will.  By degrees, the observer learns to control the vibration of the pitu-
itary body in a manner enabling him to get in touch with any of the  regions
of  the inner Worlds which he desires to visit.   The faculty is  completely
under  the control of his will.   It is not necessary for him to go  into  a
trance  or do anything abnormal,  to raise his consciousness to  the  Desire
World. He simply WILLS to see, and sees.


[PAGE 480]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   As we explained in the earlier part of this work, the neophyte must learn
to see in the Desire World,  or rather, he must learn how to understand what
he sees there.   In the Physical World objects are dense, solid,  and do not
change in the twinkling of an eye.   In the Desire World they change in  the
most erratic manner.   This is a source of endless confusion to the negative
involuntary clairvoyant, and even to the neophyte who enters under the guid-
ance of a teacher,  but the teaching soon brings the pupil to a point  where
the  Form  may change as often as it will;  he can perceive  the  Life  that
causes  the change,  and knows it for what it is,  despite all possible  and
puzzling changes.

   There  is  also another and most important distinction to be  made.   The
power  which enables on to PERCEIVE the objects in a world is NOT  identical
with the power of ENTERING that world and FUNCTIONING there.   The voluntary
clairvoyant,  though he may have received some training, and is able to dis-
tinguish from true from the false in the Desire World, is in practically the
same  relation to it as a prisoner behind a barred window is to the  outside
world--he  can  see it,  but cannot function  therein.   Therefore  esoteric
training  not  only opens up the inner vision of the aspirant,  but  at  the
proper  time  further exercises are given to furnish him with a  vehicle  in
which he can function in the inner Worlds in a perfectly self-conscious man-
ner.

                       HOW THE INNER VEHICLE IS BUILT

   In  ordinary  life  most  people live to ear,  they  drink,  gratify  the
sex-passion in an unrestrained manner, and lose their tempers on the slight-
est provocation.   Though outwardly these people may be very  "respectable,"
they are, nearly every day of their lives, causing almost utter confusion in
their organization.  The entire period  of  sleep is spent by the desire and


[PAGE 481]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

the  vital bodies in repairing the damage done in the day time,  leaving  no
time for outside work of any kind.  But as the individual begins to feel the
needs of the higher life, control sex force, and temper, and cultivate a se-
rene  disposition,  there is less disturbance caused in the vehicles  during
waking hours; consequently less time is required to repair the damage during
sleep.   Thus it becomes possible to leave the dense body for  long  periods
during  sleeping hours,  and function in the inner Worlds in the higher  ve-
hicles.   As the desire body and the mind are not yet organized, they are of
no  use as separate vehicles of consciousness.   Neither can the vital  body
leave the dense body,  as that would cause death, so it is evident that mea-
sures must be taken to provide an organized vehicle which is fluidic and  so
constructed  that it will meet the needs of the Ego in the inner  Worlds  as
does the dense body in the Physical World.

   The vital body is such an organized vehicle,  and if some means could  be
found  to loosen it from the dense body without causing death,  the  problem
would  be solved.   Besides,  the vital body is the seat of memory,  without
which  it would be impossible to bring back into our physical  consciousness
the remembrance of super-physical experiences and thus obtain the full  ben-
efit of them.

   We  remember that the Hierophants of the old Mystery  Temples  segregated
some  of  the  people into castes and tribes such as the  Brahmins  and  the
Levites,  for the purpose of providing bodies for use of such Egos  as  were
advanced enough to be ready for Initiation.  This was done in such a  manner
that the vital body became separable into two parts, as were the desire bod-
ies  of  all  humanity  at the beginning of  the  Earth  Period.   When  the
Hierophant took the pupils out of their bodies he left one part of the vital


[PAGE 482]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

body,  comprising the first and second ethers,  to perform the purely animal
functions  (they are the only ones active during sleep),  the  pupil  taking
with him a vehicle capable of perception, because of its connection with the
sense-centers of the dense body;  and also capable of memory.   It possessed
these  capabilities because it was composed of the third and fourth  ethers,
which are the mediums of sense-perception and memory.

   This is,  in fact, that part of the vital body which the aspirant retains
from life to life, and immortalizes as the Intellectual Soul.

   Since Christ came and "took away the sin of the world," (not of the indi-
vidual) purifying the desire body of our planet,  the connection between all
human  dense and vital bodies has been loosened to such an extent  that,  by
training, they are capable of separation as above described.  Therefore Ini-
tiation is open to all.

   The finer part of the desire body,  which constitutes the Emotional Soul,
is capable of separation in most people (in fact, it possessed that capabil-
ity even before Christ came) and thus when,  by concentration and the use of
the proper formula, the finer parts of the vehicles have been segregated for
use during sleep,  or at any other time,  the lower parts of the desire  and
vital bodies are still left to carry on the processes of restoration in  the
dense vehicle, the mere animal part.

   That  part  of the vital body which goes out is highly organized,  as  we
have seen.   It is an exact counterpart of the dense body.   The desire body
and  the mind,  not being organized,  are of use only because they are  con-
nected  with the highly organized dense body.   When separated from it  they
are but poor instruments, therefore before man  can  withdraw from the dense


[PAGE 483]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

body, the sense-centers of the desire body must be awakened.

   In  ordinary life the Ego is INSIDE its bodies and its force is  directed
OUTWARD.   All man's will and energy are bent upon the task of subduing  the
outside  world.   At no time is he able to get away from the impressions  of
his  outside environment and thus be free to work on himself in  his  waking
hours.   During sleep, when such an opportunity is afforded,  because of the
dense  body having lost consciousness of the world,  the Ego is OUTSIDE  his
bodies.   If man is to work on his vehicle at all,  it must be when the out-
side world is shut out as in sleep,  but yet the spirit still remains within
and in full control of the faculties, as it is in the waking state.  Not un-
til such a state can be attained will it be possible for the spirit to  work
inwardly and properly sensitize its vehicles.

   Concentration is such a state.   When in it, the senses are stilled and a
person is outwardly in the same condition as in the deepest sleep,  yet  the
spirit  remains within and fully conscious.   Most people  have  experienced
this state, at least in some degree, when they have become interested in ab-
sorption in a book.   At such times they live in the scenes depicted by  the
author  and  are  lost  to their environment.   When  spoken  to,  they  are
oblivious to the sound, so to all else transpiring around them, yet they are
fully  awake to all they are reading, to the invisible world created by  the
author,  living there and feeling the heart-beats of all the different char-
acters in the story.   They are not independent,  but are bound in the  life
which some one has created from them in the book.

   The  aspirant to the higher life cultivates the faculty of  becoming  ab-
sorbed AT WILL in any subject he chooses,  or rather not a subject  usually,
but a very simple object, which he imagines.  Thus when the proper condition


[PAGE 484]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

or  point  of absorption has been reached where his  senses  are  absolutely
still,  he concentrates his thought upon the different sense centers of  the
desire body and THEY START TO REVOLVE.

   At first their motion is slow and hard to bring about, but by degrees the
sense centers of the desire body will make places for themselves within  the
dense  and vital bodies,  which learn to accommodate themselves to this  new
activity.   Them some day,  when the proper life has developed the requisite
cleavage  between the higher and lower parts of the vital body,  there is  a
supreme effort of the will;  a spiral motion in many directions takes place,
and  the aspirant stands OUTSIDE HIS DENSE BODY.   He looks at it as at  an-
other person.  The door of this prison house has been opened.  He is free to
come  and  go,  as much at liberty in the inner worlds as  in  the  Physical
World, functioning at will, in the inner or outer World, a helper of all de-
siring his services in any of them.

   Before  the aspirant learns to voluntarily leave the body,  he  may  have
worked  in the desire body during sleep, for in some people the desire  body
becomes  organized before the separation can be brought about in  the  vital
body.   Under those conditions it is impossible to bring back these  subjec-
tive  experiences to waking consciousness,  but generally in such  cases  it
will be noticed,  as the first sign of development, that all confused dreams
will cease.   Then,  after while, the dreams will become more vivid and per-
fectly logical.   The aspirant will dream of being in places and with people
(whether  known  to him in waking hours or not matters  little),  conducting
himself  in as reasonable a way as if he were in the waking state.   If  the
place of which he dreams is accessible to him in waking hours,  he may some-
times get proof of the reality of his dream if he will  note  some  physical


[PAGE 485]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE


detail of the scene and verify his nocturnal impression next day.

   He will next find that he can, during sleeping hours,  visit any place he
desires  upon  the face of the Earth and investigate it a  great  deal  more
thoroughly than if he had gone there in the dense body,  because in his  de-
sire body he has access to all places, regardless of locks and bars.   If he
persists,  there will at last come a day when he need not wait for sleep  to
dissolve the connection between his vehicles,  but can consciously set  him-
self free.

   Specific  directions for freeing the higher vehicles cannot be given  in-
discriminately.   The separation is brought about, not by a set  formula  of
WORDS, but rather by AN ACT OF WILL, yet the manner in which the will is di-
rected  is  individual,  and  can therefore be given  only  by  a  competent
teacher.   Like all other real esoteric information,  it is never sold,  but
comes  only as a result of the pupil qualifying himself to receive it.   All
that can be done here is to give an indication of the first steps which lead
up to the acquirement of the faculty of voluntary clairvoyance.

   The most favorable time to exercise is on first awakening in the morning,
before any of the worries and cares of daily life have entered the mind.  At
that  time  one  is fresh from the inner Worlds and  therefore  more  easily
brought back into touch with them than at any other time of the day.  Do not
wait  to dress,  or sit up in bed, but relax the body perfectly and let  the
exercises  be the first waking thought.  Relaxation does not mean  simply  a
comfortable position;  it is possible to have every muscle tense WITH EXPEC-
TATION and that of itself frustrates the object,  for in that condition  the
desire  body is gripping the muscles.   It cannot do otherwise till we  calm
the mind.


[PAGE 486]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

                                CONCENTRATION

   The first thing to practice is fixing one's thoughts upon some ideal  and
holding them there WITHOUT LETTING THEM SWERVE.   It is an exceedingly  hard
task,  but,  to some extend at least, it must be accomplished before  it  is
possible to make any further progress.   Thought is the power we use in mak-
ing images, pictures, thought forms, according to ideas from within.   It is
our  principal power,  and we must learn to have absolute control of it,  so
that what we produce is not wild illusion induced by outside conditions, but
true imagination generated by the spirit from within (see diagram 1).

   Sceptics say that it is ALL imagination but,  as said before,  if the in-
ventor had not been able to imagine the telephone, etc.,  we would not today
possess those things.   His imaginings were not generally correct or true at
first,  otherwise the inventions would have worked successfully from the be-
ginning,  without the many failures and apparently useless experiments  that
have nearly always preceded the production of the practical and  serviceable
instrument  or machine.   Neither is the imagination of the  budding  occult
scientist  correct at first.   The only way to make it true is  by  uninter-
rupted practice,  day after day, exercising the will to keep the thought fo-
cussed upon one subject, object, or idea, exclusive all else.   Thought is a
great power which we have been accustomed to waste.   It has been allowed to
flow on aimlessly, as water flows over a precipice before it is made to turn
the wheel.

   The rays of the Sun, diffused over the entire surface of the Earth,  pro-
duce only a moderate warmth,  but if even a few of them are concentrated  by
means of a glass, they are capable of producing fire at  the focusing point.


[PAGE 487]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

   Thought-force is the most powerful means of obtaining knowledge.   If  it
is  concentrated upon a subject,  it will burn its way through any  obstacle
and solve the problem.   If the requisite amount of thought-force is brought
to bear,  there is nothing that is beyond the power of human  comprehension.
So long as we scatter it, thought-force is of little use to us,  but as soon
as we are prepared to take the trouble necessary to harness it,  all  knowl-
edge is ours.

   We often hear people exclaim petulantly, "Oh, I cannot think of a hundred
things at once!" when really that is exactly what they have been doing,  and
what  has caused the very trouble of which they complain.   People are  con-
stantly  thinking of a hundred things other than the one they have in  hand.
Every success has been accomplished by persistent concentration upon the de-
sired end.

   This  is something the aspirant to the higher life must positively  learn
to do.   There is no other way.   At first he will find himself thinking  of
everything  under the sun instead of the ideal upon which he has decided  to
concentrate,  but he must not let that discourage him.  In time he will find
it  easier to still his senses and hold his thoughts  steady.   Persistence,
PERSISTENCE,  and always PERSISTENCE will win at last.   Without that,  how-
ever,  no results can be expected.  It is of no use to perform the exercises
for two or three mornings or weeks and then neglect them for as long.  To be
effective they must be done faithfully every morning without fail.

   Any subject may be selected, according to the temperament and mental per-
suasion of the aspirant, so long as it is pure and mentally uplifting it its
tendency.   Christ will do for some; others,  who flowers particularly,  and
most easily helped by taking one as the subject of concentration.   The  ob-
ject matters little, but whatever it is we must imagine  it  true to life in


[PAGE 488]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

all details.   If it is Christ,  we must imagine a real Christ,  with mobile
features,  life in His eyes,  and an expression that is not stony and  dead.
We must build a living ideal, not a statue.  If it is a flower, we must,  in
imagination,  take the seed and having buried it in the ground, fix our mind
upon  it  steadily.   Presently we shall see it burst,  shooting  forth  its
roots, which penetrate the Earth in a spiral manner.  From the main branches
of the roots we watch the myriads of minute rootlets, as they branch out and
ramify  in all directions.   Then the stem begins to shoot upward,  bursting
through the surface of the earth and coming forth as a tiny green stalk.  It
grows,  presently there is an off-set;  a tiny twig shoots out from the main
stem.   It grows;  another off-set and a branch appears;  from the branches,
little stalks with buds at the end shoot out;  presently there are a  number
of leaves.   Then comes a bud at the top;  it grow larger until it begins to
burst and the red leaves of the rose show beneath the green.   It unfolds in
the air,  emitting an exquisite perfume,  which we sense perfectly as it  is
wafted  to  us on the balmy summer breeze which gently sways  the  beautiful
creation before the mind's eye.

   Only when we "imagine"  in such clear and complete outlines as these,  do
we enter into the spirit of concentration.  There must be no shadowy,  faint
resemblance.

   Those who have traveled in India have told of fakirs showing them a seed,
which was planted and grew before the eyes of the astonished witness,  bear-
ing fruit which the traveler tasted.   That was done by concentration so in-
tense that the picture was visible, not only to the fakir himself,  but also
the spectators. A case is recorded where the members of a committee of sci-
entist all saw the wonderful things done before their eyes, under conditions
where  sleight-of-hand  was  impossible,  yet  the  photographs  which  they


[PAGE 489]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

obtained while the experiment was in progress, came to naught.  There was no
impression on the sensitive plates, because there had been no material, con-
crete objects.

   At  first the pictures which the aspirant builds will be but shadowy  and
poor  likenesses,  but in the end he can,  by concentration,  conjure up  an
image more real and alive than things in the Physical World.

   When the aspirant has become able to form such pictures and has succeeded
in  holding his mind upon the picture thus created,  he may try to drop  the
picture suddenly and,  holding his mind steady without any thought,  wait to
see what comes into the vacuum.

   For a long time nothing may appear and the aspirant must carefully  guard
against  making visions for himself,  but if he keeps on faithfully and  pa-
tiently every morning,  there will come a time when,  the moment he has  let
the imaged picture drop,  in a flash the surrounding Desire World will  open
up to his inner eye.   At first it may be but a mere glimpse,  but it is  an
earnest of what will later come at will.

                                 MEDITATION

   When  the aspirant has practiced concentration for some  time,  focussing
the mind upon some simple object, building a living thought form by means of
the imaginative faculty,  he will,  by means of Meditation,  learn all about
the object thus created.

   Supposing that the aspirant has, by concentration, called up the image of
the  Christ.   It is very easy to meditatively recall the incidents  of  His
life,  suffering and resurrection,  but much beyond that can be  learned  by
meditation.  Knowledge  never  before  dreamed of will flood the soul with a


[PAGE 490]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

glorious light.   Yet something that is uninteresting and does not of itself
suggest  anything marvelous,  is better for practice.   Try to find out  all
about--say, a match, or a common table.

   When  the image of the table has been clearly formed in the  mind,  think
what kind of wood it is and whence it came.  Go back to the time when,  as a
tiny seed,  the tree from which the wood was cut first feel into the  forest
soil.   Watch it grow from year to year,  covered by the snows of winter and
warmed by the summer Sun,  steadily growing upward--its roots meanwhile con-
stantly spreading under the ground.   First it is a tender sapling,  swaying
in  the breeze;  then,  as a young tree,  it gradually stretches higher  and
higher  toward the air and the sunshine.  As the years pass,  its girth  be-
comes greater and greater, until at last one day the logger comes,  with his
axe and saw gleaming as they reflect the rays of the winter Sun.   Our  tree
is felled and shorn if its branches, leaving by the trunk;  that is cut into
logs,  which  are hauled over the frozen roads to the river bank,  there  to
await the springtime when the melting snow swells the streams.  A great raft
of the logs is made, the pieces of our tree being among them.  We know every
little peculiarity about them and would recognize them instantly among thou-
sand,  so clearly have we marked them in our mind.   We follow the raft down
the  stream,  noting the passing landscape and become familiar with the  men
who  have  the care of the raft and who sleep upon little  huts  built  upon
their floating charge.  At last we see it arrive at a sawmill and disbanded.
One by one the logs are grasped by prongs on an endless chain and hauled out
of the water.   Here comes one of our logs, the widest part of which will be
made  into  the top of our table.  It is hauled out of the water to the log-


[PAGE 491]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

deck and rolled about by men with peavies.   We hear the hungry whine of the
great  circular saws as they revolve so fast that they appear as mere  blurs
before our eyes.   Our log is placed upon a carriage which is propelled  to-
ward one of them, and in a moment those teeth of steel are tearing their way
through its body and dividing it into boards and planks.   Some of the  wood
is  selected to form part of a building,  but the best of it is taken  to  a
furniture factory and put into a kiln, where it is dried by steam so that it
will not shrink after it has been made into furniture.  Then it is taken out
and put through a great planing machine with many sharp knives,  which makes
it smooth.  Next it is sawn off into different lengths and glued together to
form table-tops.   The legs are turned from thicker pieces and set into  the
frame which supports the top;  then the whole article is smoothed again with
sandpaper,  varnished and polished,  thus completing the table in every  re-
spect.   It is next sent out,  with other furniture,  to the store where  we
bought it,  and we follow it as it is carted from that place to our home and
left in our dining room.

   Thus,  by meditation, we have become conversant with the various branches
of  industry necessary to convert a forest tree into a piece  of  furniture.
WE  have seen all the machines and the men,  and noted the peculiarities  of
the  various places.   We have even followed the life process  whereby  that
tree  has  grown from a tiny seed, and have learned that back  of  seemingly
very  commonplace things there is a great and absorbingly  interesting  his-
tory.  A pin; the match with which we light the gas; the gas itself; and the
room in which that has is burned--all have interesting histories, well worth
learning.

                                 OBSERVATION

   One of the most important aids to the aspirant in its efforts is observa-
tion.   Most people go through life blind-folded.   Of them it is  literally
true that they "have eyes,  and see not; .  .  .  have ears,  and hear not."
Upon the part of the majority of humanity there is a deplorable lack of  ob-
servation.

   Most people are, to some extent, excusable for this,  because their sight
is  not normal.   Urban life has caused untold damage to the eyes.   In  the
country  the child learns to use the muscles of the eye to the full  extend,
relaxing of contracting them as required to see objects at considerable dis-
tances  in  the  open,  or close at hand in and about the  house.   But  the
city-bred child sees practically EVERYTHING close at hand and the muscles of
its eyes are seldom used to observe objects at any great distance, therefore
that  faculty  is  to a great extent lost,  resulting  in  a  prevalence  of
near-sightedness and other eye troubles.

   It  is very important to one aspiring to the higher life that he be  able
to see all things about him in clear, definite outlines, and in full detail.
To one suffering from defective sight, the use of glasses is like opening up
a new world.   Instead of the former mistiness,  everything is seen  clearly
and definitely.  If the condition of the sight requires the use of two foci,
one should not be content with having two pairs of glasses, one for near and
one for far seeing,  thus necessitating frequent changes.   Not only are the
changes wearisome, but one is very apt to forget one pair when leaving home.
The two foci can be had in one pair of bi-focal glasses,  and such should be
worn, to facilitate observation of the minutest details.


[PAGE 493]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

                               DISCRIMINATION

   When the aspirant has attended to his eyesight,  he should systematically
observe everything and everybody, drawing conclusions from actions,  to cul-
tivate the faculty of logical reasoning.   logic is the best teacher in  the
Physical World, as well as the safest and surest guide in any world.

   While practicing this method of observation, it should always be kept  in
mind  that  it  must be used only to gather facts and not  for  purposes  of
criticism,  at least not wanton criticism.   Constructive  criticism,  which
points  out  defects  and  the means of remedying  them,  is  the  basis  of
progress;  but destructive criticism, which vandalistically demolishes  good
and bad alike with aiming at any higher attainment, is an ulcer on the char-
acter  and must be eradicated.   Gossip and idle tale-bearing are clogs  and
hindrances.   While it is not required that we shall say that black is white
and overlook manifestly wrong conduct, criticism should be made for the pur-
pose  of helping,  not to wantonly besmirch the character of a  fellow-being
because we have found a little stain.   Remembering the parable of the  mote
and the beam,  we should turn our most unsparing criticism toward ourselves.
None is so perfect that there is no room for improvement.   The more  blame-
less the man, the less prone he is to find fault and cast the first stone at
another.   If we point out faults and suggests ways for improvement, it must
be  done without personal feeling.   We must always seek the good  which  is
hidden in everything.  The cultivation of this attitude of discrimination is
particularly important.

   When the aspirant to first-hand knowledge has practiced concentration and
meditation  exercises  for  some  time,  and has become fairly proficient in


[PAGE 494]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

them, there is a still higher step to be taken.

   We have seen that concentration is focusing thought upon a single object.
It is the means whereby we build a clear, objective, and living image of the
form about which we wish to acquire knowledge.

   Meditation  is the exercise whereby the history of the object of our  in-
vestigation is traced and,  so to say, entered into, to pick out of it every
shred of evidence as to its relation to the world in general.

   These two mental exercises deal, in the deepest and most thorough manner,
imaginable,  with THINGS.   They lead up to a higher, deeper and more subtle
stage of mental development, which deals with the very SOUL OF THINGS.

   The name of that stage is Contemplation.

                                CONTEMPLATION

   In  contemplation there is no reaching out in thought or imagination  for
the sake of getting information, as was the case in Meditation.   It is sim-
ply the holding of the object before our mental vision and letting the  soul
of it speak to us.   We repose quietly and relaxed upon a couch or  bed--not
negatively,  but thoroughly on the alert--watching for the information  that
will surely come if we have reached the proper development.   Then the  FORM
of the object seems to vanish and we see only the LIFE at work.   Contempla-
tion  will teach us about the Life side,  as Meditation taught us about  the
Form side.

   When we reach this stage and have before us,  say,  a tree in the forest,
we  lost sight of the Form entirely,  and see only the Life,  which in  this
case is a group spirit.  We shall find, to our astonishment,  that the group
spirit of the tree includes the various insects which feed upon it; that the


[PAGE 495]                                    ACQUIRING FIRST-HAND KNOWLEDGE

parasite and its host are emanations from one and the same group spirit, for
the  higher we ascend in the invisible realms,  the fewer the  separate  and
distinct forms, and the more completely the One Life predominates,  impress-
ing  upon  the  investigator  the supreme fact that there  is  but  the  One
Life--the Universal Life of God, in Whom it is an actual fact that "we live,
and move, and have our being."  Mineral, plant, animal, and man--all,  with-
out exception--are manifestations of God,  and this fact furnishes the  true
basis of brotherhood--a brotherhood which includes everything from the  atom
to the Sun, because all are emanations from God.  Conceptions of brotherhood
based upon any other foundation,  such as class distinctions, Race affinity,
similarity of occupation,  etc.,  fall far short of this true basis,  as the
occult scientist clearly realizes when he sees the Universal Life flowing in
all that exists.

                                  ADORATION

   When this height has been reached by Contemplation,  and the aspirant has
realized  that he is in truth beholding God in the Life that  permeates  all
things, there remains still to be taken the highest step, Adoration, whereby
he  unites himself with the Source of all things,  reaching by that act  the
highest goal possible of attainment by man until the time when the permanent
union takes place at the end of the great Day of Manifestation.

   It is the writer's opinion that neither the heights of Contemplation, nor
the  final step of Adoration can be attained without the aid of  a  teacher.
The aspirant need never fear, however, that for want of a teacher he will be
delayed in taking these steps;  nor need he be concerned about looking for a


[PAGE 496]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

teacher.   All that is necessary for him to do is start to improve  himself,
and to earnestly and PERSISTENTLY continue therein.  In that way he will pu-
rify  his vehicles.   They will commence to shine in the inner  Worlds,  and
cannot fail to attract the attention of the teachers,  who are always watch-
ing for just such cases and are more than eager and glad to help those  who,
because of their earnest efforts to purify themselves, have won the right to
receive  help.   Humanity is sorely in need of helpers who are able to  work
from the inner Worlds,  therefore "seek and ye shall find,"  but let us  not
imagine  that by going about from one professed teacher to another,  we  are
seeking.   "Seeking,"  in that sense of the word, will avail nothing in this
dark world.   We ourselves must kindle the light--the light which invariably
radiates from the vehicles of the earnest aspirant.   That is the star which
will lead us to the teacher, or rather the teacher to us.

   The time required to bring results from the performance of the  exercises
varies with each individual and is dependent upon his application, his stage
in  evolution and his record in the book of destiny;  therefore  no  general
time can be set.   Some,  who are almost ready, obtain results in a few days
or weeks; others have to work months, years, and even their whole life with-
out  VISIBLE results,  yet the results will be there,  and the aspirant  who
faithfully persists will some day,  i this or a future life,  behold his pa-
tience  and  faithfulness rewarded and the inner Worlds open  to  his  gaze,
finding himself a citizen of realms where the opportunities are immeasurably
greater than in the Physical World only.

   From that time--awake or asleep, through what men call life,  and through
what  men  call  death--his  consciousness will be unbroken.  He will lead a

consciously continuous existence,  having the benefit of all the  conditions
which make for more rapid advancement to every higher positions of trust, to
be used in the unlifting of the race.

                               CHAPTER XVIII.

                 THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH; AND VOLCANIC
                                 ERUPTIONS.

   Even  among  occult scientists it is counted amount  the  most  difficult
problems to investigate the mysterious construction of the Earth.  Every oc-
cult scientist knows how much easier it is to thoroughly and accurately  in-
vestigate the Desire World and the Region of Concrete Thought and bring back
the  results into the Physical World than to investigate completely the  se-
crets of our physical planet, because to do that fully, one must have passed
through the nine lesser Mysteries and the first of the Great Initiations.

   Modern scientists know very little about this matter.   So far as seismic
phenomena are concerned, they very frequently change their theories, because
they  are constantly discovering reasons why their previous hypotheses  were
untenable.   They have, with all their usual splendid care, investigated the
very  outside shell,  but only to an insignificant depth.   As for  volcanic
eruptions,  they try to understand them as they try to understand everything
else, in a purely mechanical way, depicting the center of the Earth as a fi-
ery  furnace and concluding that the eruptions are caused by the  accidental
admission of water and in other similar ways.

   In a certain sense, their theories have some foundation, but in this case
they  are, as always, neglecting the spiritual causes which to the occultist


[PAGE 499]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

appear to be the true ones.  To him, the world is far from being "dead."  On
the contrary,  its every nook and crevice is permeated by spirit,  which  is
the leaven that causes changes in and upon the planet.

   The different kinds of quartz, the metals, the disposition of the various
strata--all have a much higher significance than the materialistic investi-
gator has ever been able to grasp.  To  the  occult  scientists,  the way in
which these materials are arranged is full of meaning.  On  this subject, as
on every other, occult science stands in the same relation to modern science
as physiology does to anatomy.  Anatomy  states with minute detail the exact
position of every bone, muscle, ligament, nerve,  etc., their relative posi-
tions to one another and so forth,  but does not give any clue to the use of
any  one of the different parts of which the body is composed.   Physiology,
on the other hand,  not only states the position and structure of every part
of the body, but also tells their use in the body.

   To  know the different strata of the Earth and the relative positions  of
the  planets  in the sky without having also a knowledge of  their  use  and
meaning  in  the life and purpose of the Cosmos,  is as useless as  to  know
merely  the positions of bones, nerves,  etc.,  without  understanding  also
their use in the functional economy of the body.

                          THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST.

   To the trained clairvoyant sight,  of the Initiate of the various degrees
of the Mysteries,  the Earth appears built in strata,  something like an on-
ion,  one layer or stratum outside another.   There are nine such strata and
the central core,  making ten in all.  These strata are revealed to the Ini-
tiate  gradually.  One stratum becomes accessible to him at each Initiation,


[PAGE 500]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

so  that at the end of the nine lesser Initiations he is master of  all  the
layers, but has not yet access to the secrets of the core.

   In  ancient parlance these nine steps are called the "lesser  Mysteries."
They  take  the neophyte consciously through all that relates  to  his  past
evolution,  through the activities of involuntary existence,  so that he  is
able to understand the manner and meaning of the work he then performed  un-
consciously.   He is shown how to present ninefold constitution (the  three-
fold body,  the threefold soul,  and the threefold spirit) was brought  into
existence;  how the great creative Hierarchies worked on the virgin  spirit,
awakening in it the Ego,  helping it to form the body;  and also the work he
himself has done,  to extract from the threefold body as much of the  three-
fold  soul as he now possesses.   One step at a time is he led  through  the
nine steps of the lesser mysteries, the nine strata.

   This  number nine is the root number of our present stage  of  evolution.
It  bears a significance in our system that no other number does.   It is  a
number of Adam, the life which commenced its evolution as Man, which reached
the  human stage during the Earth Period.  In the Hebrew,  as in the  Greek,
there  are no numerals,  but each letter has a numerical value.   In  Hebrew
"Adam"  is called "ADM.)  The value of "A" is 1; of "D," 4; and of "M,"  40.
If we add these figures, we get 1+4+4+0=9--the number of Adam, or humanity.

   If we turn from the Book of Genesis, which deals with the creation of man
in the hoary past,  to the Book of Revelation,  which deals with his  future
attainment, we find that the number of the beast which hinders is 666.  Add-
ing these figures, 6+6+6=18; and further, 1+8=9--we have again the number of
humanity,  which  is  itself the cause of all the evil which hinders its own


[PAGE 501]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

progress.   Going further, to the point where the number of those who are to
be  saved  is  stated,  we  find  it  to  be  144,000.   Adding  as  before,
1+4+4+000=9--again the number of humanity, showing that practically it  will
be  saved in its totality,  the number incapable of progress in our  present
evolution  being negligible in comparison to the grand total,  and even  the
few who fail are not lost, but will progress in a later scheme.

   The consciousness of the mineral and the plant is really unconsciousness.
The  first glimmering dawn of consciousness begins with the animal  kingdom.
We  have seen also that according to the most modern  classification,  there
are thirteen steps in the animal kingdom:  three classes of Radiates;  three
classes of Mollusks;  three classes of Articulates; and four classes of Ver-
tebrates.

   If we regard ordinary man as a step by himself,  and remember that  there
are  thirteen Initiations from man to God, or from the time he commenced  to
qualify himself for becoming a self-conscious Creative Intelligence, we have
again the same number, Nine: 13+1+13=27 2+7=9.

   The number 9 is also hidden in the age of Christ Jesus, 33; 3+3=9, and in
a similar manner in the 33 degrees of Masonry.  In olden times Masonry was a
system of Initiation into the lesser Mysteries which, as we have seen,  have
9 degrees, but the Initiates often wrote it as 33.  Similarly we read of the
l8th  degree  of  the  Rosicrucians,  which  was  only  a  "blind"  for  the
uninitiated,  because there are never more than 9 degrees in any lesser Mys-
tery, and the Masons of today have but very little of the occult ritual left
in their degrees.

   We have also the nine months of gestation, during which the body is built


[PAGE 502]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

up   to   its  present  efficiency;   and  there  are  in  the   body   nine
perforations-two eyes,  two nostrils, two ears, one mouth, and the two lower
orifices.

   When  the advancing man has passed through the nine  lesser  Initiations,
gaining thereby entrance to all the layers of the Earth,  entrance into  the
core is yet to be won.  That is opened to him by the first of the four Great
Initiation, in which he learns to know the mystery of the mind, that part of
his being begun on Earth.   When he is ready for the first Great  Initiation
he has developed his mind to the degree all men are destined to attain to at
the end of the Earth Period.   In that Initiation he is given the key to the
next stage,  and all work done by him after that will be such as humanity in
general will do in the Jupiter Period, and does not concern us at present.

   After his first Great Initiation, he is an Adept.  The second,  third and
fourth Initiations pertain to the stages of development to be arrived at  by
ordinary humanity in the Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan Periods.

   These thirteen Initiations are symbolically represented in the Christ and
His twelve Apostles.   Judas Iscariot  is the traitorous propensities of the
lower nature of the neophyte.  The beloved John is the Venus Initiation, and
Christ Himself symbolizes the Divine Initiate of the Vulcan Period.

   In different schools of occult science the rites of Initiation vary, also
their statement of the number of Initiations, but that is merely a matter of
classification.   It will be observed that such vague descriptions as can be
given become that such vague descriptions as can be given becomes more vague
as one proceeds higher and higher.   Where seven or more degrees are  spoken
of,  almost nothing is said of the sixth Initiation, and nothing whatever of
the ones beyond.  That  is  because  of  another  division--the six steps of


[PAGE 503]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

"Preparation." and the four Initiations which bring the candidate to the end
of the Earth Period, to Adeptship.  Then there must always be three more, if
the philosophy of the school or society goes so far.   The writer,  however,
knows of none but the Rosicrucians who have anything to say of the three Pe-
riods  which preceded the Earth Period, save the bare statement  that  there
were such Periods.   They are not brought very definitely into  relationship
whti our present phase of existence, however.  Likewise, other occult teach-
ings simply state that there will be three more schemes of evolution, but no
particulars are given.  Of course, under those circumstances, the three last
Initiations are not mentioned.

   Diagram  l8 will give an idea of the arrangement of the  Earth's  strata,
the central core being omitted to indicate more clearly the lemniscate  for-
mation of the currents in the ninth stratum.   In the diagram the strata are
represented  as being of equal thickness, thought in reality some  are  much
thinner than other.   Beginning at the outside, they appear in the following
order:

   (l)  The Mineral Earth:  This is the stony crust of the Earth, with which
Geology deals as far as it is able to penetrate.

   (2)   The Fluid Stratum:   The matter of the stratum is more  fluid  than
that  of the outside crust,  yet it is not watery,  but rather more  like  a
thick paste.   It has the quality of expansion,  like that of an exceedingly
explosive  gas,  and is kept in place only by the enormous pressure  of  the
outer crust.  Were that removed, the whole of the fluid stratum would disap-
pear  in  the space with a tremendous explosion.   These correspond  to  the
Chemical and Etheric Regions of the Physical World.

   (3) Vapor Stratum:  In  the  first  and  second strata there is really no


[PAGE 504]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

conscious life.   But in this stratum there is an even-flowing and pulsating
life, as in the Desire World surrounding and inter-penetrating our Earth.

   (4)   Water Stratum:   In this stratum are the germinal possibilities  of
the  that  exists upon the surface of the Earth.   Here are  the  archetypal
force which are back of the group spirits; also the archetypal forces of the
minerals,  for this is the direct physical expression of the Region of  Con-
crete Thought.

   (5)   Seed Stratum:   Material scientists have been baffled in their  ef-
forts to discover the origin of life, how the first living things came forth
from previously dead matter.

   In reality,  according to the occult explanation of evolution,  the ques-
tion should be how the "dead" things originated.   THE LIFE WAS THERE PREVI-
OUS  TO THE DEAD FORMS.   It built its bodies from the attenuated,  vaporous
substance long before it condensed into the Earth's solid crust.   ONLY WHEN
THE LIFE HAD LEFT THE FORMS COULD THEY CRYSTALLIZE AND BECOME HARD AND DEAD.

   Coal is but crystallized plant bodies;  coral is also the crystallization
of animal forms.   The life leaves the FORMS and the FORMS die.   Life never
came into a form to awaken it to life.  Life departed from the forms and the
forms died.  Thus did "dead" things come to be.

   In this fifth stratum is the primordial fount of life from which came the
impetus that built all the forms on Earth.   It corresponds to the Region of
Abstract Thought.

   (6)  Fiery Stratum:  Strange as it may seem, this stratum is possessed of
sensation.    Pleasure and pain,  sympathy and antipathy have here their ef-
fect  on  the  Earth.  It  is  generally  supposed  that  under  no possible


[PAGE 505]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

circumstances can the Earth have any sensation whatever.   The occult scien-
tist,  however, as he watches the harvesting of the ripe grain and the gath-
ering  of fruit from the trees in the autumn,  or the plucking  of  flowers,
knows  the pleasure experienced by the Earth itself.   It is similar to  the
pleasure felt by the cow when its bursting udders are being relieved by  the
sucking calf.  The Earth feels the delight of having yielded nourishment for
its progeny of Forms,  this delight reaching its culmination in the  harvest
time.

   On the other hand, when plants are torn out by the roots, it is patent to
the occult scientist that the Earth senses a sting of pain.  For that reason
he  does not eat the plant-foods which grow under the Earth.   In the  first
place they are full of the Earth force and deficient in Sun force,  and  are
additionally poisoned by being pulled up by the roots.   The only  exception
to  this  rule  is  that  he may partake  sparingly  of  the  potato,  which
originally grew on the surface of the earth,  and has only in  comparatively
recent times grown beneath the soil.   Occultists endeavor to nourish  their
bodies on fruits which grow toward the Sun, because they contain more of the
higher Sun force, and have not caused the Earth pain.

   It might be supposed that mining operations would be very painful to  the
Earth,  but the reverse is the case.  Every disintegration of the hard crust
causes  a sensation of relief and every solidification is a source of  pain.
Where  a  mountain torrent washes away the soil and carries  it  toward  the
plains,  the earth feels freer.  Where the disintegrated matter is again de-
posited,  as in a bar outside the mouth of a great river,  there is a corre-
sponding sense of uneasiness.

   As sensation in animals and men is due to their separate vital bodies, so


[PAGE 506]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the feeling of the Earth is particularly active in this sixth stratum, which
corresponds  to the World of Life Spirit.   To understand the pleasure  felt
when mining operations are disintegrating the hard rock,  and the pain  when
deposits  gather,  we must remember that the Earth is the dense  body  of  a
Great Spirit,  and to furnish us with an environment in which we could  live
and  gather  experience,  it had to crystallize this body into  its  present
solid condition.

   As evolution proceeds,  however, and man learns the lessons pertaining to
this acme of concretion,  the Earth will softer and its spirit more and more
liberated.   This  is what Paul meant when he spoke of  the  whole  creation
groaning and travailing, waiting for the day of liberation.

   (7)  Refracting Stratum:  This part of the Earth corresponds to the World
of Divine Spirit.  There are, in occult science what are known as "The Seven
Unspeakable Secrets."   For those who are not acquainted with these secrets,
or  have  not as least an inkling of their import,  the properties  of  this
stratum must seem particularly absurd and grotesque.   In it all the  forces
which are known to us as the "Laws of Nature" exist as moral,  or rather im-
moral  forces.   In the beginning of the conscious career of man  they  were
much worse than at present.   But it appears that as humanity progresses  in
morals,  these forces improve correspondingly; also that any lapse in morals
has  a  tendency to unleash these Nature forces and causes  them  to  create
havoc upon the Earth;  while the striving for higher ideals makes them  less
inimical to man.

   The forces in this stratum are thus, at any time,  an exact reflection of
the  existing  moral status of mankind.  From the occult point of  view, the


[PAGE 507]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

"hand of God"  which smites a Sodom or a Gomorrah is not a foolish supersti-
tion, for as surely as there is individual responsibility to the law of Con-
sequence  which brings to each person the just results of his deeds  whether
for  good or evil,  so is there also community and national  responsibility,
which  brings upon groups of men corresponding results for their  collective
acts.   Nature  forces are the general agents of such  retributive  justice,
causing flood,  s or earthquakes, or the beneficent formation of oil or coal
for various groups, according to their deserts.

   (8)   Atomistic Stratum:   This is the name given by the Rosicrucians  to
the eighth layer of the Earth,  which is the expression of the World of Vir-
gin  Spirits.   It seems to have the property of multiplying many  fold  the
things in it;  this applies,  however,  only to those things which have been
definitely formed.   An unshapen piece of wood,  or an unhewn stone has  not
existence there,  but upon anything which has been shaped,  or has life  and
form (such as a flower or a picture),  this stratum has the effect of multi-
plication to an astonishing degree.

   (9)  Material Expression of the Earth spirit:   There are here lemniscate
currents,  which are intimately connected with the brain,  heart and sex or-
gans of the human race.  It corresponds to the World of God.

   (l0)   Center  of Being of the Earth spirit:   Nothing more can  be  said
about this at present except that it is the ultimate seed ground of all that
is in and on Earth, and corresponds to the Absolute.

   From the sixth or fiery stratum to the surface of the Earth are a  number
of shafts in different places.  The outer ends of these are called "volcanic
craters."  When  the  Nature  forces in the seventh stratum are unleashed so


[PAGE 508]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

that they can express themselves through a volcanic outburst,  they set  the
(sixth)  fiery  stratum in motion and the agitation spreads outward  to  the
mouth of the crater.   The bulk of the material is taken from the  substance
of the second stratum, for that is the denser counterpart of the sixth stra-
tum as the vital body, the second vehicle of man,  is the denser counterpart
of the life Spirit,  the sixth principle.   This fluidic stratum,  with  its
expansive and highly explosive quality, insures an unlimited supply of mate-
rial at the point of eruption.   The contact with the outer atmosphere hard-
ens that part of it which is not blown away into space,  thus forming a lava
and dust,  until,  as the blood from a wound congeals and stanches the flow,
so the lava finally seals the aperture from the inner parts of the Earth.

   As  might be gathered from the fact that it is the  reflected  immorality
and  anit-spiritual tendencies of manking which arouse the Nature-forces  in
the seventh stratum to destructive activity,  it is generally profligate and
degenerate peoples who succumb to these catastrophes.   They,  together with
others  whose  destiny,  self-generated under the law  of  consequence,  for
various reasons,  involves a violent death, are gathered from many lands  by
the superhuman forces, to the point where the eruption is to occur.   To the
thoughtful,  the volcanic outbursts of Vesuvius,  for instance,  will afford
corroboration of this statement.

   A  list of these outbursts during the last 2,000 years shows  that  their
frequency has been increasing with the growth of materialism.   In the  last
sixty years,  especially,  in the ratio that materialistic science has grown
arrogant  in its absolute and sweeping denial of everything spiritual,  have
the eruption increase in frequency.  While  there  were but six eruptions in


[PAGE 509]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

                                DIAGRAM l8:

                          CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH


[PAGE 510]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the first l,000 years after Christ, the last five have taken place within 5l
years, as will be shown.

   The first eruption during the Christian Era was that which destroyed  the
cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii, in which the elder Pliny perished, A.  D.
79.   The older eruptions followed in A. D. 203, 472, 5l2, 652,  982,  l036,
ll58, l500, l63l, l737, l794, l822, l855, l872, l855, l89l, l906.

   In  the first thousand years,  there were six eruptions;  in  the  second
thousand there have been twelve,  the last five occurring in a period of  5l
years, as before stated.

   Of  the  entire number of l8 eruptions,  the first nine occurred  in  the
so-called "dark ages," that is to say, the l600 years during which the West-
ern World was dominated by what are commonly termed the "heathen," or by the
Roman  Church.   The remainder have taken place in the  last  three  hundred
years,  during which the advent and rise of Modern Science, with its materi-
alizing tendencies, has driven almost the last vestige of spiritually to the
wall,  particularly  in the last half of the l9th  Century.   Therefore  the
eruptions for that period comprise nearly one-third of the total number that
have taken place in our Era.

   To counteract this demoralizing influence,  a great deal of occult infor-
mation has been given out during that time by the Elder Brothers of  Wisdom,
who  are ever working for the benefit of humanity.   It is thought  that  by
giving  out this knowledge and educating the few who will still receive  it,
it  may  be possible to stem the tide of materialism,  which  otherwise  may
bring  about very serious consequences to its advocates who,  having so long
denies the existence of the spiritual,  may be unable to find their  balance
when  they discover that though still living, they have been deprived of the


[PAGE 511]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

dense body.   Such persons may meet a fate too sad to contemplate with equa-
nimity.   One of the causes of the dread "white plague" is this materialism,
not traceable to the present incarnation perhaps, but the result of previous
materialistic beliefs and affirmations.

   We have spoken of the demise of the elder Pliny,  at the time of the  de-
struction of Pompeii.  It is interesting to follow the fate of such a scien-
tist,  not  so much for the sake of that particular individual  as  for  the
light it throws upon the manner in which the memory of Nature is read by the
occult scientist,  how the impressions are made upon it,  and the effect  of
past traits upon present tendencies.

   When a man dies,  his dense body disintegrates,  but the sum total of its
forces can be found in the seventh or reflecting stratum of the Earth, which
may be said to constitute a reservoir in which,  as forces,  past forms  are
stored.   If,  knowing the time of the death of a man, we search this reser-
voir,  it is possible to find his form there.   Not only is it stored in the
seventh stratum, but the eighth or atomistic stratum multiplies it,  so that
nay one type may be reproduced and modified by others.  Thus it is used over
and  over again in the formation of other bodies.   The brain-tendencies  of
such a man as Pliny the elder may have been reproduced an thousand years af-
terwards,  and have been partly the cause of the present crop of materialis-
tic scientists.

   There is still much for modern,  material scientists to learn and to  un-
learn.   Though they fight to the last ditch what they sneeringly  term  the
"illusionary ideas" of the occult scientist, they are being compelled to ac-
knowledge their truth and accept them one by one, and it is only a matter of
time when they will have been compelled to accept them all.


[PAGE 512]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   Mesmer, who was sent by the Elder Brother, was worse than ridiculed,  but
which  materialists  had changed the name of the force  discovered  by  him,
calling  it "hypnotism"  instead of "Mesmerism,"  it at once became  "scien-
tific."

   Twenty  years ago Madame Blavtsky,  a faithful pupil of Eastern  Masters,
said that the Earth had a third movement,  in addition to the two  producing
day and night and the seasons.   She pointed out that the inclination of the
Earth's axis is caused by a movement which,  in due time,  brings the  north
pole to where the equator is now and still later,  to the place now occupied
by the sought pole.  This, she said, was known to the ancient Egyptians, the
famous  planisphere at Dendera showing that they had records of  three  such
revolutions.   These statements,  in common with the whole of her unexcelled
work, "The Secret Doctrine," were hooted at.

   A few years ago, an astronomer, Mr. G. E. Sutcliffe,  of Bombay,  discov-
ered and mathematically demonstrated that Laplace had made a mistake in  his
calculations.   The discovery and rectification of this error  confirmed  by
mathematical  demonstration the existence of the third motion of the  Earth,
as  claimed  by Madame Blavatsky.   It also afforded an explanation  of  the
theretofore puzzling fact that tropical plants and fossils are found in  the
polar regions,  as such a  movement would necessarily produce,  in due time,
tropical and glacial periods on all parts of the Earth, corresponding to its
changed position in relation to the Sun.  Mr.  Sutcliffe sent his letter and
demonstration to NATURE, but that journal refused to publish them,  and when
the  author made public the discovery by means of a pamphlet,  he drew  upon
himself  an appalling storm of vituperation.  However, he is an avowed and a


[PAGE 513]                                         CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

deep student of "The Secret Doctrine," and that explains the hostile  recep-
tion according his discovery and its inevitable corollaries.

   Later,  however, a Frenchman, not an astronomer, but a mechanician,  con-
structed  an apparatus demonstrating the ample possibility of the  existence
of such a movement.   The apparatus was exhibited at the Louisiana  Purchase
Exhibition at Saint Louis, and was warmly endorsed by M. Camille Flammarion,
as  worthy of investigation.   Here was something concrete,  something  "me-
chanical,"  and the editor of THE MONIST,  thought he described the inventor
as a man laboring somewhat under "mystic illusions"  (because of his  belief
that  the  ancient Egyptians knew of this third motion),  nevertheless  mag-
nanimously overlooked that feature of the case and said that he had not lost
faith in M.  Beziau's theory on that account.   He published an  explanation
and an essay by M.  Beziau, wherein the motion and its effects upon the sur-
face  of the Earth were described in terms similar to those used  by  Madame
Blavatsky and Mr. Sutcliffe.  M. Beziau is not definitely "billed" as an oc-
cultist, therefore his discovery may be countenanced.

   Many  instances  might be cited showing how occult information  has  been
corroborated  later  by  material science.   One of them  is  the  atomistic
theory,  which  is  advocated in the Greek philosophies and  later  in  "The
Secret Doctrine."  It was "discovered" in l897, by Professor Thomson.

   In Mr. A. P. Sinnett's valuable work, "The Growth of the Soul," published
in  l896,  the author stated that there are two planets beyond the orbit  of
Neptune,  only one of which,  he thought,  would be discovered by modern as-
tronomers.  In NATURE for August, l906, the statement is made that Professor
Barnard, through the 36-inch Lick refractor, had discovered such a planet in


[PAGE 514]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

1892.   There had been no mistake about it, yet he waited fourteen years be-
fore he announced his discovery!  One need not be concerned about that, how-
ever.   The main point is that the planet is there,  and that Mr.  Sinnett's
book said so ten years before Professor Barnard's claim to prior  discovery.
Probably,  previous to l906 the announcement of the newly discovered  planet
might have tended to disarrange some popularly accepted theory!

   There  are many such theories.   The Copernican theory is not  altogether
correct, and there are many facts that cannot be accounted for by the lauded
Nebular  theory  alone.    Tycho  Brahe,   the  famous  Danish   astronomer,
refused to accept the Copernican theory.   He had a very good reason for re-
maining  true to the Ptolemaic theory because, as he said,  by it the  move-
ments  of  the  planets figured out correctly,  while  with  the  Copernican
theory, it is necessary to use a table of corrections.  The Ptolemaic system
is correct from the standpoint of the Desire World,  and it has points  that
are needed in the Physical World.

   By  many  the statements made in the foregoing pages will  be  considered
fantastic.   Be  it so.   Time will bring to all a knowledge  of  the  facts
herein  set forth.   This book is only for the few who,  having freed  their
minds from the shackles of orthodox science and religion,  are ready to  ac-
cept this until they have proven it wrong.

             CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ AND THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

                       ANCIENT TRUTHS IN MODERN DRESS

   Having  encountered among the public a widespread desire to  learn  some-
thing of the Order of Rosicrucians,  and as there is a lack of understanding
of  the  important place occupied by the Brothers of the Rose Cross  in  our
Western civilization, even among our students, it may be well to furnish au-
thentic information upon the subject.

   Everything in the world is subject to law, even our evolution is thus en-
compassed;  spiritual and physical progression go hand in hand.   The sun is
the physical light bringer and, as we know,  it apparently travels from east
to west bringing light and life to one part of the earth after another.  But
the  visible  sun is only a part of the sun as the visible body is  a  small
part of composite man.   There is an invisible and spiritual sun whose  rays
promote soul growth upon one part of the earth after another as the physical
sun promotes the growth of form,  and this spiritual impulse also travels in
the same direction as the physical sun; from east to west.

   Six  or seven hundred year B.C.,  a new wave of spirituality was  started
near  the western shores of the Pacific Ocean to give enlightenment  to  the
Chinese nation and the religion of Confucius is embraced to this day by many
millions in the celestial kingdom.  Later we note the effect of this wave in
the  religion  of  Buddha,  a  teaching  designed to stir the aspirations of


[PAGE 516]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

millions  of Hindus and western Chinese.  In its westward course it  appears
among  the more intellectual Greeks in the lofty philosophies of  Pythagoras
and Plato,  and at last it sweeps over the western world, among the pioneers
of the human race, where it takes the lofty form of the Christian religion.

   The Christian religion has gradually worked its way to the westward, even
to the shores of the Pacific Ocean and thither the spiritual aspirations are
being  massed and concentrated.   There they will reach a point of  culmina-
tion,  prior to taking a new leap across the ocean and inaugurating a higher
and  more  lofty spiritual awakening in the Orient than now exists  in  that
part of the earth.

   Just  as day and night,  summer and winter,  ebb and flood,  follow  each
other  in unbroken sequence according to the law of alternating  cycles,  so
also  the  appearance of a wave of spiritual awakening in any  part  of  the
world is followed by a period of material reactions, so that our development
may not become onesided.

   Religion,  Art  and Science are the three most important means  of  human
education, and they are a trinity in unity which cannot be separated without
distorting our viewpoint of whatever we may investigate.   TRUE RELIGION em-
bodies both science and art, for it teaches a beautiful life in harmony with
the laws of nature.

   TRUE  SCIENCE  is  artistic and religious in the highest  sense,  for  it
teaches us to reverence and conform to laws governing our well-being and ex-
plains why the religious life is conducive to health and beauty.

   TRUE  ART is as educational as science and as uplifting in its  influence
as religion.   In architecture we have a most sublime presentation of cosmic
lines  of  force  in  the  universe.  It fills the spiritual beholder with a


[PAGE 517]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

powerful  devotion and adoration born of an awe-inspiring conception of  the
overwhelming grandeur and majesty of Deity.   Sculpture and painting,  music
and  literature inspire us with a sense of transcendent loveliness  of  God,
the immutable source and goal of all this beautiful world.

   Nothing short of such an all-embracing teaching will answer the needs  of
humanity permanently.  There was a time, even as late as Greece,  when RELI-
GION,  ART and SCIENCE  were taught unitedly in Mystery temples.  But it was
necessary to the better development of each that they should separate for  a
time.

   RELIGION held sole sway in the so-called "dark ages."   During that  time
it  bound both Science and Art hand and foot.   Then came the period of  Re-
naissance and ART came to the fore in all its branches.  Religion was strong
as yet,  however,  and Art was only too often prostituted in the service  of
Religion.   Last came the wave of modern SCIENCE,  and with iron hand it has
subjugated Religion.

   It  was a detriment to the world when Religion shackled  Science.   IGNO-
RANCE and SUPERSTITION caused untold woe, nevertheless man cherished a lofty
spiritual ideal then;  he hoped for a higher and better life.   It is  infi-
nitely more disastrous that Science is killing Religion,  for now even HOPE,
the only gift of the gods left in Pandora's box, may vanish before MATERIAL-
ISM and  AGNOSTICISM.

   Such a state cannot continue.  Reaction must set in.  If it does not, An-
archy will rend the Cosmos.   To avert a calamity RELIGION,  SCIENCE and ART
must reunite in a higher expression of the GOOD,  the TRUE and the BEAUTIFUL
than obtained before the separation.

   Coming  events cast their shadows before, and when the Great  Leaders  of
humanity  saw  the tendency towards ultramaterialism which is now rampant in


[PAGE 518]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the Western World, they took certain steps to counteract and transmute it at
the auspicious time.   They did not wish to kill the budding Science as  the
latter has strangled Religion, for they saw the ultimate good which will re-
sult when an advanced Science has again become the co-worker of Religion.

   A spiritual Religion,  however, cannot blend with a materialistic Science
any  more  than  oil can mix with water.   Therefore  steps  were  taken  to
spiritualize Science and make Religion scientific.

   In the thirteenth century a high spiritual teacher, having the symbolical
name Christian Rosenkreuz--Christian:   Rose:  Cross--appeared in Europe  to
commence  that work.   He founded the mysterious Order of Rosicrucians  with
the  object of throwing occult light upon the misunderstood Christian  Reli-
gion and to explain the mystery of Life and Being from the scientific stand-
point in harmony with Religion.

   Many centuries have rolled by since the birth,  as Christian  Rosenkreuz,
of the Founder of the Rosicrucian Mystery School,  and by many his existence
is  even regarded as a myth.   But his birth as Christian Rosenkreuz  marked
the  beginning of a new epoch in spiritual life of the Western World.   That
particular Ego has also been in continuous physical existence ever since, in
one or another of the European Countries.   He has taken a new body when his
successive  vehicles have outlived their usefulness,  or circumstances  ren-
dered  it expedient that he changes the scene of his activities.   Moreover,
he is embodied today--an Initiate of high degree, an active or potent factor
in all affairs of the West--although unknown to the World.

   Her  labored  with the Alchemists centuries before the advent  of  modern
science.  He,  through, an intermediary, inspired the now mutilated works of


[PAGE 519]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

Bacon.   Jacob Boehme and others received through him the inspiration  which
makes their works so spiritually illuminating.  In the works of the immortal
Goethe and the masterpieces of Wagner the same influence meets us.   All un-
daunted spirits who refuse to be fettered by either orthodox science or  or-
thodox  religion,  who fling away the husks and penetrate to  the  spiritual
kernel  regardless of vilification or of flattery,  draw  their  inspiration
from  the  same  fountain as did and does the great  spirit  which  animated
Christian Rosenkreuz.

   His  very name is an embodiment of the manner and the means by which  the
present day man is transformed into the Divine Superman.  This symbol,

                           "Christian Rosen Kreuz"
                         [The] Christian Rose Cross,

shows the end and aim of human evolution,  the road to be traveled,  and the
means whereby that end is gained.   The black cross,  the twining green stem
of the plant,  the thorns, the blood red roses--in these is hidden the solu-
tion of the World Mystery--Man's past evolution,  present constitution,  and
particularly the secret of his future development.

   It hides from the profane,  but reveals to the Initiate the more  clearly
how he is to labor day by day to make for himself that choicest of all gems,
the Philosopher's Stone--more precious than the Kohinoor; nay,  than the sum
of  all earthly wealth!   It reminds him how mankind,  in its ignorance,  is
hourly wasting the actual concrete material that might be used in the forma-
tion of this priceless treasure.

   To  keep him steadfast and true through every adversity,  the Rose  cross
holds aloft, as an inspiration,  the  glorious consummation in store for him


[PAGE 520]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

that  overcometh,  and  points to Christ as the Star  of  Hope,  the  "first
fruits,"  Who  wrought  this marvelous Stone while inhabiting  the  body  of
Jesus.

   Upon investigation it has been found that there was in all systems of Re-
ligion a teaching reserved for the Priest-craft and not given to the  multi-
tude.  The Christ also spoke to the multitude in parables, but explained the
inner  meaning of these parables to the disciples,  to give them  an  under-
standing more suited to their developed minds.

   Paul  gave "milk"  to the BABES or younger members of the community,  but
"meat"  to the STRONG who had studied more deeply.   Thus there  has  always
been  an INNER and an OUTER TEACHING, and this inner teaching was  given  in
so-called  Mystery Schools which have changed from time to time to suit  the
needs of the people among whom they were designed to work.

   The  Order of Rosicrucians is not merely a secret society;  it is one  of
the Mystery Schools,  and the Brothers are Hierophants of the lesser Myster-
ies, Custodians of the Sacred Teachings and a spiritual Power more potent in
the  life of the Western World than any of the visible  Governments,  though
they  may  not interfere with humanity so as to deprive them of  their  free
will.

   As  the path of development in all cases depends upon the temperament  of
the  aspirant,  there are two paths, THE MYSTIC and THE  INTELLECTUAL.   The
Mystic is usually devoid of intellectual knowledge;  he follows the dictates
of his heart and strives to do the will of God as he FEELS it,  lifting him-
self upward without being conscious if any definite goal,  and in the end he
attains knowledge.  In the middle ages people were not as intellectual as we
are nowadays,  and those who felt the call of a higher life usually followed
the mystic path.  But in the last few  hundred  years,  since  the advent of


[PAGE 521]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

modern science, a more INTELLECTUAL humanity has peopled the earth; the head
has completely overruled the heart, materialism has dominated all  spiritual
impulse and the majority of the thinking people do not believe anything they
cannot  touch,  taste or handle.   Therefore,  it is necessary  that  appeal
should be made to their intellect in order that the heart may be allowed  to
believe what the intellect has sanctioned.  As a response to this demand the
Rosicrucian Mystery teachings aim to correlate scientific facts to spiritual
verities.

   In  the past these have been kept secrete from all but a  few  Initiates,
and even today they are among the most mysterious and secret in the  Western
World.   All so-called "discoveries" of the past which have professed to re-
veal the Rosicrucian secrets, have been either fraudulent,  or the result or
treachery upon the part of some outsider who may, accidentally or otherwise,
have  overheard fragments of conversation, unintelligible to all  but  those
who have the key.   It is possible to live under the same roof and on  terms
of the closest intimacy with an Initiate of any school,  yet his secret will
always  remain hidden in his breast until the friend has reached  the  point
where he can become a Brother Initiate.   The revealing of secrets does  not
depend upon the Will of the Initiate, but upon the qualifications of the as-
pirant.

   Like  all other Mystery Orders,  the Order of Rosicrucians is  formed  on
cosmic lines:   If we take balls of even size and try how many it will  take
to cover one and hide it from view, we shall find that it will require 12 to
conceal  a thirteenth ball.   The ultimate division of physical matter,  the
true atom,  found in interplanetary space, is thus grouped in twelve  around
one.  The twelve signs of the Zodiac enveloping our Solar System, the twelve


[PAGE 522]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

semi-stones of the musical scale comprising the octave,  the twelve Apostles
who clustered around the Christ,  etc., are other examples of this  grouping
of 12 and 1.   The Rosicrucian Order is therefore also composed of 12 Broth-
ers and a 13th.

   There are other divisions to be noted, however.  We have seen that of the
Heavenly  Host of twelve Creative Hierarchies who were active in our  scheme
of evolution,  five have withdrawn to liberation, leaving only seven to busy
themselves with our further progress.   It is in harmony with this fact that
the man of today, the indwelling Ego, the microcosm,  works outwards through
seven visible orifices in his body:  2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 nostrils and a mouth,
while five more orifices are wholly or partially closed. the mammae, the um-
bilicus and two excretory organs.

   The  seven roses which garnish our beautiful emblem and the five  pointed
radiating star behind, are emblematical of the twelve Great Creative Hierar-
chies  which  have assisted the evolving human spirit through  the  previous
conditions   as  mineral,   plant  and  animal,   when  it  was  devoid   of
self-consciousness  and unable to care for itself in the  slightest  degree.
Of  these twelve hosts of Great Beings,  three classes worked upon and  with
man of their own free wills and without any obligation whatever.

   These  are  symbolized by the three points in the star  upon  our  emblem
which points upwards.   Two more of the Great Hierarchies are upon the point
of  withdrawal,  and these are pictured in the two points of the star  which
radiate  downward  from the center.   The seven roses reveal the  fact  that
there  are still seven Great Creative Hierarchies active in the  development
of  the  beings upon earth,  and as all of these various  classes  from  the
smallest to the greatest are but parts of One Great Whole whom we call  God,
the whole emblem is a symbol of God in manifestation.


[PAGE 523]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

   The Hermetic axiom says:  "As above so below," and the lesser teachers of
mankind  are also grouped upon the same cosmic lines of 7,  5 and 1.   There
are  upon earth seven schools of the lesser Mysteries,  five of the  Greater
Mysteries and the whole is grouped under one Central Head Who is called  the
Liberator.

   In  the Order of Rosicrucians seven Brothers go out into the World  when-
ever occasion requires; appearing as men among other men or working in their
invisible  vehicles with or upon others as needed;  yet it must be  strictly
kept in mind that they never influence people against their will or contrary
to their desires; but only strengthen good wherever found.

   The  remaining five Brothers never leave the temple;  and though they  do
possess physical bodies all their work is done from the inner Worlds.

   The Thirteenth is Head of the Order, the link with a higher Central Coun-
cil  composed of the Hierophant of the Greater Mysteries,  who do  not  deal
with ordinary humanity at all, but only with graduates of the lesser Myster-
ies.

   The  Head  of the Order is hidden from the outside world  by  the  twelve
Brothers,  as the central ball mentioned in our illustration.   Even the pu-
pils of the School never see him,  but at the nightly Services in the Temple
His presence is FELT by all,  whenever He enters,  and is the signal for the
commencement of the ceremony.

   Gathered around the Brothers of the Rose Cross,  as their pupils,  are  a
number  of "lay brothers";  people who live in various parts of the  Western
World,  but are able to leave their bodies consciously,  attend the services
and  participate in the spiritual work at the temple;  they having each  and
every  one been "initiated"  in the method of so doing by one of  the  Elder
Brothers.  Most of them are able to remember all that happens, but there are


[PAGE 524]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

a few cases where the faculty of leaving the body was acquired in a previous
life  of well-doing and where a drug habit or a sickness contracted  in  the
present  existence has unfitted the brain to receive impression of the  work
done by the man when away.

[PAGE 524 cont'd]                               ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

                                 INITIATION.

   The  general  idea of initiation is that it is merely  a  ceremony  which
makes  one member of a secret society; that it may be conferred upon  anyone
willing to pay a certain price, a sum of money in most cases.

   While  that is true of the so-called initiation of fraternal  orders  and
also in most pseudo-occult orders,  it is altogether an erroneous idea  when
applied to initiations into various degrees of truly occult Brotherhoods, as
a little understanding of the real requirements and of their  reasonableness
will readily make clear.

   In the first place there is no golden key to the temple; merit counts but
not money.   Merit is not acquired in a day; it is the cumulative product of
past  good action.   The Candidate for initiation is usually totally  uncon-
scious that he is a candidate,  he is usually living his life in the  commu-
nity  and  serving his fellow man for days and years  without  any  ulterior
thought until one day there appears in his life the teacher, a Hierophant of
the  lesser  Mysteries appropriate to the country in which he  resides.   By
this  time  the candidate has cultivated within himself  certain  faculties,
stored up certain powers for service and help, of which he is usually uncon-
scious or which he does not know how to properly utilize.   The task of  the
initiator  will now be plain;  he shows the candidate the latent  faculties,
the   dormant   powers  and  initiates  him  into  their  use;  explains  or


[PAGE 525]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

demonstrates  to  him FOR THE FIRST TIME how the candidate  may  awaken  the
static energy into dynamic power.

   Initiation may be accomplished by a ceremony, or not,  but let it be par-
ticularly observed,  that while Initiation is the inevitable culmination  of
prolonged spiritual endeavor, whether conscious or the reverse upon the part
of the candidate,  it can positively never take place till the requisite in-
ner  development has accumulated the latent powers which Initiation  teaches
how to use dynamically,  any more than pulling the trigger can cause an  ex-
plosion in a gun that has not first been loaded.

   Neither is there any danger that the teacher may overlook anyone who  has
attained the requisite development.   Each good and unselfish deed increases
the luminosity and vibrant power of the candidate's aura enormously,  and as
surely  as the magnet attracts the needle,  so will the brilliancy  of  that
auric light bring the teacher.

   It is,  of course, impossible to describe in a book intended for the gen-
eral  public the stages of the Rosicrucian Initiation;  to do so would be  a
breach  of  faith and it would also be impossible for lack of words  to  ad-
equately express oneself.   But it is permissible to give an outline and  to
show the purpose of initiation.

   The lesser Mysteries deal only with evolution of mankind during the Earth
Period.  In the first three and one-half Revolutions of the life wave around
the seven globes the Virgin Spirits had not yet attained consciousness.   In
consequence of this fact we are ignorant of how we came to be as we are  to-
day.   The candidate is to have light upon that subject so by the  spell  of
the  Hierophants during the period of initiation into the first  degree  his
consciousness  is turned towards that page of the memory of  nature  bearing
the records of the first revolution when we recapitulated the development of


[PAGE 526]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

the  Saturn Period.   He is still in full possession of his  every-day  con-
sciousness; he knows and remembers the facts of twentieth Century life,  but
he  is now consciously watching the progress of the evolving host of  Virgin
Spirits of which he formed one unit during the Saturn Revolution.   Thus  he
learns  how the first steps were taken in the Earth Period towards the  goal
of attainment which will be revealed to him in a later step.

   Having learned the lesson as practically described in Chapter X, the can-
didate has acquired first-hand knowledge upon this subject and has come into
direct touch with the Creative Hierarchies in their work with and upon  man;
he is therefore able to appreciate their beneficent labors in the World  and
is  in measure able to range himself in line with them;  becoming  thus  far
their co-worker.

   When  the  time  has arrived for him to take the  second  degree,  he  is
similarly  caused  to  turn his attention to the conditions  of  the  second
Revolution  of the Earth Period,  and as depicted in the memory  of  nature;
then he watches in full consciousness the progress made at that time by  the
Virgin  Spirits,  much  as  Peter Ibbetson, the  hero  of  a  book.   "Peter
Ibbetson,"  by  George du Maurier;  it is well worth reading,  for it  is  a
graphic description of certain phases of subconsciousness--watched his child
life during the nights when he "dreamed true."   In the third degree he fol-
lows the evolution of the third or Moon,  Revolution,  and in the fourth de-
gree  he sees the progress made in the half-Revolution we have made  of  the
fourth.

   There is, however, a further step taken in each degree; the pupil sees in
addition  to the work done in each revolution also the work accomplished  in
the corresponding Epoch during our present stay upon globe D, the Earth.

   During the  first degree he follows the work of the Saturn Revolution and


[PAGE 527]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

its latest consummation in the Polarian Epoch.

   In  the second degree he follows the work of the Sun Revolution  and  its
replica:  the Hyperborean Epoch.

   During  the  third degree he watches the work as performed  in  the  Moon
Revolution and sees how that was the basis of life in the Lemurian Epoch.

   During  the fourth degree he sees the evolution of the last half  Revolu-
tion with its corresponding period of time in our present stay on Earth; the
first  half  of the Atlantean Epoch which ended when the dense  foggy  atmo-
sphere subsided,  and the sun first shone upon land and sea;  then the night
of  unconsciousness  was over,  the eyes of the indwelling  Ego  were  fully
opened, and he was able to turn the Light of Reason upon the problem of con-
quering  the  World.   That was the time when a man as we now know  him  was
first born.

   When in the olden system of initiation we hear that the candidate was en-
tranced  for a period of three and one-half days,  reference is had  to  the
part of initiation just described,  and the three and one-half days refer to
the  stages  gone through,  they are not by any means  days  of  twenty-four
hours;  the actual time varies with each candidate,  but in all cases he  is
taken  through  the unconsciousness development of mankind during  the  past
Revolutions,  and when it is said that he is awakened at the time of sunrise
on the fourth day that is the mystical way of expressing that his initiation
into  the work of the involuntionary career of man ceases at the  time  when
the sun rose above the clear atmosphere of Atlantis.   Then the candidate is
also hailed as a "first-born."

   Having  become familiar with the road we have traveled in the  past,  the
fifth degree takes  the  candidate to the very end of the Earth Period, when


[PAGE 528]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

a  glorious  humanity is gathering the fruits of this Period and  taking  it
away from the seven globes upon which we evolve during each day of  manifes-
tation, into the first of the five dark globes which are our habitation dur-
ing the Cosmic nights.  The densest of these is located in the Region of Ab-
stract Thought,  and is in reality the "Chaos" spoken of on page 249 and the
following pages.   This globe is also the Third Heaven, and when Paul speaks
of being caught up into the Third Heaven and of seeing things there which he
could  not  lawfully  reveal,  he was referring to  the  experiences  of  an
equivalent of this fifth degree in the present Rosicrucian Mysteries.

   After being shown the end in the fifth degree,  the candidate is made ac-
quainted  with the means whereby that end is attained during  the  remaining
thee  and one-half Revolutions of the Earth Period;  the four remaining  de-
grees being devoted to his enlightenment in that respect.

   By  the  insight  he  has  thus acquired  he  is  able  to  intelligently
co-operate with the Powers that work for Good, and thus he will help to has-
ten the day of our emancipation.

   In order to rout a common misconception we wish to make clear to students
that we are not Rosicrucians because we study their teachings, nor does even
admission  to  the temple entitle us to call ourselves by  that  name.   The
writer,  for instance,  is only a lay brother,  a pupil,  and would under no
circumstances call himself a Rosicrucian.

   We know well, that when a boy has graduated from grammar school he is not
therefore  fitted to teach.   He must first go through high school and  col-
lege,  and  even  then  he may not feel the call to  be  a  school  teacher.
Similarly  in  the  school of life,  because a man has  graduated  from  the
Rosicrucian Mystery School  he  is  not  even then a Rosicrucian.  Graduates


[PAGE 529]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

from  the various schools of the lesser mysteries advance into five  schools
of the greater mysteries.   In the first four they pass the four Great  Ini-
tiations  and at last reach the Liberator,  where they receive  a  knowledge
concerning  other evolutions and are given the choice of remaining  here  to
assist their brothers or enter other evolutions as Helpers.  Those who elect
to  stay  here  as helpers are given various positions  according  to  their
tastes  and natural bent.   The Brothers of the Rose Cross are  among  those
Compassionate  Ones,  and it is a sacrilege to drag the Rosicrucian name  in
the  mire by applying it to ourselves when we are merely students  of  their
lofty teachings.

   During  the past few centuries the Brothers have worked for  humanity  in
secret;  each night at midnight there is a Service at the temple  where  the
Elder  Brothers,  assisted by the lay brothers who are able to  leave  their
work  in  the World (for many of them reside in places where it is  yet  day
when it is midnight in the location of the temple of the Rose Cross), gather
up  from everywhere in the Western World the thoughts of  sensuality,  greed
selfishness and materialism.   These they seek to transmute into pure  love,
benevolence,  altruism  and spiritual aspirations sending them back  to  the
World to uplift and encourage all Good.  Were it not for this potent  source
of spiritual vibration materialism must long ago have totally squelched  all
spiritual effort,  for there has never been a darker age from the  spiritual
standpoint than the last three hundred years of materialism.

   Now the time has come,  however, when the method of secret endeavor is to
be supplemented with a more direct effort to promulgate a definite,  logical
and sequential teaching concerning the origin, evolution and future develop-
ment of the World and man, showing both  the  spiritual  and  the scientific


[PAGE 530]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

aspect:  a teaching which makes no statements that are not supported by rea-
son and logic;  a teaching which is satisfying to the mind, for it holds out
a reasonable solution to all mysteries; it neither begs nor evades questions
and its explanations are both profound and lucid.

   But,  and this is a very important "But,"  THE ROSICRUCIANS DO NOT REGARD
AN  INTELLECTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF GOD AND THE UNIVERSE AS AN END IN  ITSELF;
far from it!   The greater the intellect, the greater the danger of its mis-
use.   Therefore,  THIS SCIENTIFIC, LOGICAL AND EXHAUSTIVE TEACHING IS GIVEN
IN  ORDER  THAT MAN MAY BELIEVE IN HIS HEART THAT WHICH HIS HEAD  HAS  SANC-
TIONED AND START TO LIVE THE RELIGIOUS LIFE.

                         THE ROSICRUCIAN FELLOWSHIP

   In order to promulgate this teaching the Rosicrucian Fellowship has  been
formed, and anyone who is not a HYPNOTIST, PROFESSIONAL MEDIUM, CLAIRVOYANT,
PALMIST OR ASTROLOGER, may enroll as a PRELIMINARY COURSE STUDENT by writing
to the General Secretary.  There is no fee for Initiation,  or dues.   Money
cannot buy our teaching, advancement depends on merit.

   After completing the Preliminary Course one is put on the Regular Student
list for a period of two years,  after which if he has become so imbued with
the  verity  of the Rosicrucian teachings that he is prepared to  sever  his
connection with all other occult or religious orders--THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES
AND FRATERNAL ORDERS ARE EXCEPTED--he may assume the Obligation which admits
him to the degree of PROBATIONER.

   We  do  not  mean to insinuate by the foregoing  clause  that  all  other
schools  of  occultism are of no account--far from it--many  roads  lead  to
Rome,  but  we  shall  attain with much less effort it we follow one of them


[PAGE 531]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

than if we zigzag from path to path.  Our time and energy are limited in the
first place, and are still further curtailed by family and social duties not
to be neglected for self-development.   It is to husband the minim of energy
which we may legitimately expend upon ourselves,  and to avoid waste of  the
scanty  moments at our disposal,  that resignation from all other Orders  is
insisted upon by the leaders.

   The world is an aggregate of opportunities,  but to take advantage of any
one  of them we must possess efficiency in a certain line of endeavor.   De-
velopment of our spiritual powers will enable us to help or harm our  weaker
brothers.   It is only justifiable when efficiency in Service of Humanity is
the object.

   The Rosicrucian method of attainment differs from other system in one es-
pecial particular:  It aims, even at the very start, to emancipate the pupil
from  dependence upon others,  to make him SELF-RELIANT in the very  highest
degree,  so that he may be able to stand alone under all  circumstances  and
cope with all conditions.  Only one who is thus strongly poised can help the
weak.

   When  a number of people meet in a class or circle  for  self-development
along  NEGATIVE lines,  result are usually achieved in a short time  on  the
principle  that it is easier to drift with the tide than to breast the  cur-
rent.   The medium is not master of his actions, however, but the slave of a
spirit control.  Hence such gatherings must be shunned by Probationers.

   Even  classes which meet in positive attitude of mind are not advised  by
the Elder Brothers,  because the latent powers of all members are massed and
visions of the inner worlds obtained by anyone there,  are partly due to the
faculties of others.   The heat of coal in the center of a fire is  enhanced
by  surrounding  coals, and the clairvoyant produced in a circle, be it ever


[PAGE 532]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

so positive,  is a hot-house plant, too dependent himself to be trusted with
the care of others.

   Therefore each Probationer in the Rosicrucian Fellowship performs his ex-
ercises in the seclusion and privacy of his room.   Results may be  obtained
more slowly by the system,  but when they appear,  they will be manifest  as
powers cultivated by himself, useable independently of all others.  Besides,
the  Rosicrucian methods build character at the same time that they  develop
spiritual faculties and thus safeguard the pupil against yielding to tempta-
tion to prostitute divine powers for worldly prestige.

   When  the  Probationer has compiled with the necessary  requirements  and
completed the term of probation, he may send request for individual instruc-
tion by the Elder Brothers through the General Secretary.

                   THE INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS OF THE
                          ROSICRUCIAN FELLOWSHIP

   Having formed the Rosicrucian Fellowship for the purpose of  promulgating
the  teaching given in this book,  and aiding aspirants on the path of  pro-
gression, it became necessary to find a permanent home and facilities requi-
site for doing this work.   To this end a tract of land was purchased in the
town of Oceanside,  Cal.,  ninety miles south of Los Angeles and forty miles
north of San Diego, the southwesternmost city of the United States.

   This tract occupies a commanding site having a most wonderful view of the
great  Pacific Ocean to the west and the beautiful snow capped mountains  in
the east.

   Southern  California  offers  exceptional  opportunities  for   spiritual
growth,  because of the ether atmosphere being denser than in any other part
of  the world and MOUNT ECCLESIA, as the Earth Fellowship  Headquarters  are
called, is particularly favored in this respect.

                                OUR BUILDINGS

   The  work  at  Headquarters was begun toward the end of  1911.   To  date
(1973) numerous buildings have been erected, some of which now no longer ex-
ist.  The Pro-Ecclesia, or Chapel, in which two 15-minute services have been
held daily since its dedication in December, 1913,  was thoroughly renovated
in  1962.   A devotional service with lecture continues to be  conducted  on
Sundays.   A  two-story Administration Building was completed in  1917,  and
renovated in 1962.   On the second floor are offices for the various depart-
ments:  Esoteric, Correspondence Courses, Editorial, Foreign Languages,  and
Accounting.   On  the  first  floor are  the  Shipping  Department  and  the
printshop,  where Lessons,  RAYS, pamphlets, etc.,  are printed.   An offset
press was installed in 1972.

   The  Dining  Hall  was  built in 1914, added to in  the  late  30's,  and
renovated in 1962.  Vegetarian meals are served.  The Healing Temple,  where
a  healing service is conducted each evening,  was completed in 1920.   Rose
Cross Lodge was built in 1924, for the use of guests and workers.  It is now
used largely for storing books.   The Sanitarium Building was opened in 1939
and   used  for  a  number  of  years  to  treat  patients  suffering   from
non-contagious  diseases.   It is now our Guest House,  used by workers  and
members.   Numerous cottages built since 1962,  and some renovated ones pro-
vide living quarters for workers.  The Healing Dept. Building was erected in
1940.  Here secretaries conduct our healing work.

                          THE CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOL

   In  addition to publications of The Rosicrucian Fellowship noted  in  the
back  of  this book there are three correspondence courses  offered  on  the
freewill basis:   Rosicrucian Philosophy, Bible Interpretation,  and Astrol-
ogy.  Information concerning these is furnished upon request.

                       THE SYMBOLISM OF THE ROSE CROSS

   When inquiring into the meaning of any myth,  legend or symbol of  occult
value,  it is an absolute necessity that we should understand that,  as  any
object  in the three-dimensional world may, or rather must,  be viewed  from
all points to obtain a full and complete comprehension thereof,  so all sym-
bols  have  a number of aspects.  Each viewpoint reveals a  different  phase
from the others, and all have an equal claim to consideration.

   Viewed in its fullness,  this wonderful symbol contains the key to  man's
past  evolution,  his present constitution and future development,  together
with the method of attainment.   In the form where it is represented with  a
single rose in the center it symbolizes the spirit radiating from itself the
four vehicles:  the dense, vital and desire bodies plus the mind;  where the
spirit  has  drawn  INTO its instruments and  become  the  INDWELLING  human
spirit.   But  there was a time when that condition did not obtain,  a  time
when the three-fold spirit hovered above its vehicles and was unable to  en-
ter.  Then the cross stood alone without the rose, symbolizing the condition
which prevailed in the early third of Atlantis.   There was even a time when
the  upper limb of the cross was lacking and man's constitution  was  repre-
sented  by  the  Tau (T) that was in the Lemurian epoch when he had only the


[PAGE 535]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

dense, vital and desire bodies, but lacked the mind.  Then the animal nature
was  paramount.   Man followed desire without reserve.   At a still  earlier
time,  in the Hyperborean Epoch,  he was also minus the desire body and pos-
sessed only the dense and vital bodies.  Then man-in-the-making was like the
plants:   chaste and devoid of desire.  At that time his constitution  could
not  have  been represented by a cross.   It was symbolized  by  a  straight
shaft, a pillar (I).

   This  symbol has been considered phallic,  an emblem showing  the  licen-
tiousness  of  the people who worshiped it.  Truly it is a  symbol  of  gen-
eration, but generation is by no means synonymous with degradation--far from
it--the   pillar   is   the  lower  limb  of  the   cross,   symbolical   of
man-in-the-making when he was plantlike.   The plant is unconscious of  pas-
sion, desire, innocent of evil.  It generates and perpetuates its species in
a manner so pure,  so chaste,  that properly understood,  it is a model  for
fallen  and passionate humanity to worship as an ideal and it was  given  to
earlier races with that intent.  The Phallus and Yona used in the Greek mys-
tery  temples  were given by the hierophants in that spirit,  and  over  the
temple was placed the enigmatical words:  "Man, know thyself,"  which motto,
properly understood,  is similar to that of the Rose Cross, for it shows the
reason for man's fall into desire, passion and sin, and gives the key to his
liberation  in the same way that the roses upon the cross indicate the  path
of liberation.

   The  plant  is innocent,  BUT NOT VIRTUOUS;  it has  neither  desire  not
choice.   Man has both.   He may follow desire or not as he wishes,  that he
may learn to master himself.

   While he was plant-like,  a hermaphrodite, he could generate FROM HIMSELF
without the help of another,  but though he was as chaste and as innocent as
the  plants,  he  was also as unconscious and inert.  In order to advance he


[PAGE 536]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

must have desire to spur him on, and a mind to guide him, and therefore half
his  creative force was retained for the purpose of building a brain  and  a
larynx.   He had at that time a round shape similar to that of  the  embryo,
and the present larynx was a part of the creative organ which adhered to the
head when the body straightened out.  The connection between the two is seen
even today in the fact that the boy,  who expresses the positive pole of the
generative force,  changes his voice at puberty.   That the same force which
builds another body when it is sent OUTWARDS builds the brain when  RETAINED
is  equally clear when we consider that sex mania leads to  insanity,  while
the profound thinker will feel little inclination for amorous practices.  He
uses  all  his creative force to generate thought instead of wasting  it  in
sense gratification.

   At  the time when man commenced to withhold half his creative  force  for
the above mentioned purpose, his consciousness was directed INWARDS to build
organs.  He was capable of SEEING these organs and he used the same creative
force  then under the direction of Creative Hierarchies in planning  and  in
executing plans of organs, that he now uses in the OUTER world to build air-
ships, houses, automobiles, telephones, etc.  Then he was unconscious of how
that  half of the creative force was used which was sent OUTWARDS  for  gen-
eration of another body.

   Generation was carried on under the guidance of Angels.  At certain times
of the year they herded the growing man together in great temples and  there
the  generative act was performed.   Man was unconscious of the  fact.   His
eyes had not yet been opened,  and though it was necessary for him to have a
partner  who  had the half or other pole of the creative force available for


[PAGE 537]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

generation  which he retained to build organs within,  he did not  at  first
KNOW  his wife.   In ordinary life he was shut within himself so far as  the
Physical World was concerned,  but it was different when he was brought into
such intimate and close touch with another, as in the case of the generative
act.  Then for the moment the spirit pierced the veil of flesh and Adam KNEW
his wife.  He had ceased to KNOW HIMSELF--thus his consciousness became more
and more and more centered outside himself in the OUTSIDE WORLD and he  lost
his INNER PERCEPTION.   That cannot be fully regained until he has passed to
the  stage where it is no longer necessary to have a partner in  generation,
and he has reached the development where he can again utilize his WHOLE cre-
ative force at will.   Then he will again KNOW HIMSELF ad he did during  his
stage of plant-like existence,  but with this all important difference  that
he will use his creative faculty consciously,  and will not be restricted to
using  it  solely for the pro-creation of his own species,  but  may  create
whatever he will.  Neither will he use his present organs of generation, but
the  larynx will SPEAK the creative WORD as directed by the  spirit  through
the co-ordinating mechanism of the brain.  Thus the two organs built by half
the creative force will in time be the means whereby man will eventually be-
come an independent self-conscious creator.

   Even  at the present time man molds matter both by thought and voice,  as
instanced in scientific experiments where thoughts have created an image  on
photographic plates,  and where the human voice has created geometrical fig-
ures in sand,  etc.   In proportion as man becomes unselfish he will release
the  creative force held in leash.   That will give him added thought  power
and  enable him to utilize it for upliftment of others instead of  to  plant
how to degrade and subject others to his will.   He will learn how to master
HIMSELF and cease to try to master others, except it be done temporarily FOR


[PAGE 538]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

THEIR GOOD,  but never for selfish ends.   Only one who has mastered himself
is  qualified  to rule others,  and competent to judge when that  should  be
done, and what is best for them.

   Thus  we see that in time the present passionate mode of generation  will
be  again superseded by a pure and more efficient method than  the  present,
and  that also is symbolized in the Rose Cross where the rose is  placed  in
the  center between the four arms.   The long limb represents the body,  the
two horizontals, the two arms, and the short upper limb, the head.  THE ROSE
IS IN PLACE OF THE LARNYX.

   The rose,  like any other flower,  is the generative organ of the  plant.
Its green stem carries the colorless,  passionless plant blood.   The  blood
red rose shows the passion filled blood of the human race,  but in the  rose
the vital fluid is not sensuous,  it is chaste and pure.   Thus it is an ex-
cellent  symbol of the generative organ in the pure and holy state to  which
man  will  attain when he has cleansed and purified his blood  from  desire,
when he has become chaste, pure and Christ-like.

   Therefore  the  Rosicrucians look ardently forward to the  day  when  the
roses shall bloom upon the cross of humanity,  therefore the Elder  Brothers
greet  the aspiring soul with the words of the Rosicrucian  Greeting:   "May
the Roses bloom upon your Cross," and therefore the greeting is given in the
meetings of the Fellowship Centers by the leader to the assembled  students,
probationers  and  disciples who respond to the greeting by saying  "And  on
yours, also."

   John speaks of his purification (1st epistle,  iii,  9) and says that  he
who is born of God cannot sin, FOR HE KEEPETH HIS SEED WITHIN HIM.  It is an
absolute  necessity  to progress that the aspirant should be chaste.  Yet it


[PAGE 539]                                         THE ORDER OF ROSICRUCIANS

must be borne in mind,  that absolute celibacy is not required of man  until
he has reached a point where he is ready for the great initiations, and that
is a duty we owe to the whole to perpetuate the race.   If we are  mentally,
morally,  physically and financially able,  we may approach the act of  gen-
eration  as a holy sacrifice laid upon the altar of humanity,  but  not  for
sensual pleasure.  Neither should it be performed in an austere,  forbidding
frame  of mind,  but in glad giving up of oneself for the privilege of  fur-
nishing a friend seeking rebirth with the body and environment he needs  for
development.   Thus we shall also help him cultivate the blooming roses upon
his cross.



                                TOPICAL INDEX

                     ALPHABETICAL LIST OF WORDS INDEXED

   The Topical Index is arranged with particular view to facilitate  topical
study, but at the same time alphabetical order has been adhered to as nearly
as possible.  We add an alphabetical list of the words indexed.

   Opposite each word in this list will be found a number, which refers to a
page in the Index.   On that page the word is grouped with others pertaining
to the same topic.

   The student is particularly requested to note the CONSECUTIVE arrangement
of references.   For instance,  under the heading,  "VITAL BODY,"  the first
reference tells where that vehicle had its first inception, the last directs
to  a page which treats of its final spiritualization,  and the  intervening
references  point  IN  ORDERLY SUCCESSION to the places  where  its  gradual
unfoldment is described.  These references, in themselves, form an excellent
syllabus of the vital body.

   By   diligent  and  intelligent  use  of  this  index   the   Rosicrucian
Cosmo-Conception will be found a most complete and exhaustive reference  li-
brary,  and  we  recommend  students to STUDY THE INDEX as much as the book.

and reveal much that is hidden in a general reading of the book.

EGO. (SEE HUMAN SPIRIT)
   The Ego is a Virgin Spirit involved in a threefold veil of

        and engenders the illusion of a separate self...................216
   During Involution it brooded unconsciously over the evolving

                   MORNING AND EVENING EXERCISES PERFORMED

                         BY THE ROSICRUCIAN ASPIRANT

                            THE EVENING EXERCISE
                           (Mentioned on page 111)

                               --------------

   The value of exercise,  RETROSPECTION, is of greater value than any other
method in advancing the aspirant upon the path of attainment.  It has such a
far-reaching effect that it enables one to learn now,  not only the  lessons
of this life, but lessons ordinarily reserved for future lives.

   After going to bed at night the body should be relaxed.   Then the aspir-
ant begins to review the scenes of the day IN REVERSE ORDER,  starting  with
the  events of the evening,  then the occurrences of the afternoon,  of  the
forenoon, and the morning.  He endeavors to PICTURE to himself each scene as
faithfully  as possible--seeks  to REPRODUCE BEFORE HIS MIND'S EYE all  that
took place in each pictured scene WITH THE OBJECT OF JUDGING HIS ACTIONS, OF
ASCERTAINING  IF HIS WORDS CONVEYED THE MEANING HE INTENDED OR GAVE A  FALSE
IMPRESSION,  OR IF HE OVERSTATED OR UNDERSTATED IN RELATING  EXPERIENCES  TO
OTHERS.  He reviews his moral attitude in relation to each scene.  At meals,
did he eat to live,  or did he live to eat--to please  the palate?   Let him
judge himself and blame where BLAME is due, PRAISE  where merited.

   People sometimes find it difficult to remain awake till the exercise  has
been performed.  In such cases it is permissible to sit up in bed till it is
possible to follow the ordinary method.


[PAGE 697]                                     MORNING AND EVENING EXERCISES

   The value of retrospection is enormous--far-reaching beyond  imagination.
IN  THE  FIRST PLACE,  we perform the work of restoration  of  harmony  CON-
SCIOUSLY  and  in a shorter time than the desire body can do  during  sleep,
leaving a larger portion of the night available for outside work than other-
wise possible.   IN THE SECOND PLACE, we live our purgatory and first heaven
EACH  NIGHT,  and build into the spirit as RIGHT FEELING the essence of  the
day's experience.   Thus we escape purgatory after death and also save  time
spent in the first heaven.  And LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, having extracted day by
day the essence of experiences which make for soul growth,  and having built
them into the spirit,  we are actually living in an attitude of mind and de-
veloping  along  lines that would ordinarily have been reserved  for  future
lives.   By the faithful performance of this exercise we expunge day by  day
undesirable  occurrences from our subconscious memory so that OUR  SINS  ARE
BLOTTED  OUT,  OUR AURAS COMMENCE TO SHINE WITH SPIRITUAL GOLD EXTRACTED  BY
RETROSPECTION FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF EACH DAY,  AND THUS WE ATTRACT THE AT-
TENTION OF THE TEACHER.

   The pure shall see God,  said Christ,  and the Teacher will quickly  open
our  eyes WHEN WE ARE FIT to enter into the "Hall of Learning,"  the  desire
world,  where we obtain our first experiences of conscious life without  the
dense body.

                            THE MORNING EXERCISE

   CONCENTRATION,  the second exercise,  is performed in the morning at  the
very earliest moment possible after the aspirant awakes.   He must not arise
to  open blinds or perform any other unnecessary act.   If the body is  com-
fortable he should at once relax and commence to concentrate.   This is very


[PAGE 698]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

important,  as the spirit has just returned from the desire world at the mo-
ment of waking, and at that time the conscious touch with that world is more
easily regained than at any other time of the day.

   We remember from Lecture No.  4 that during sleep the currents of the de-
sire body flow, and its vortices move and spin with enormous rapidity.   But
as  soon  as it enters the dense body its currents and vortices  are  almost
stopped  by the dense matter and the nerve currents of the vital body  which
carry messages to and from the brain.   It is the object of this exercise to
still  the dense body to the same degree of inertia and insensibility as  in
sleep,  although the spirit within is perfectly awake, alert, and conscious.
Thus we make a condition where the sense centers of the desire body can  be-
gin to revolve while inside the dense body.

   Concentration is a word that puzzles many and carries meaning to but few,
so  we will endeavor to make its significance clear.   The dictionary  gives
several definitions,  all applicable to our idea.  One is "to draw to a cen-
ter";  another from chemistry,  "to reduce to extreme purity and strength by
removing valueless constituents."   Applied to our problem, one of the above
definitions tells us that if we draw our thoughts to a center,  a point,  we
increase  their strength on the principle that the power of the  sun's  rays
increase  when  focused  to  a point by means of  a  magnifying  glass.   By
eliminating from our mind for the time being all other subjects,  our  whole
thought  power is available for use in attaining the object or  solving  the
problem on which we are concentrating; we may become so absorbed in our sub-
ject  that  if  a cannon were fired above our heads we would  not  hear  it.
People may become so LOST in a book that they are oblivious to all else, and


[PAGE 699]                                     MORNING AND EVENING EXERCISES

the aspirant to spiritual sight must acquire the faculty of becoming equally
absorbed in the idea he is concentrating upon,  so that he may shut out  the
world  of sense from his consciousness and give his whole attention  to  the
spiritual world.   When he learns to do that, he will see the spiritual side
of an object or idea illuminated by spiritual light, and thus he will obtain
a knowledge of the inner nature of things undreamt of by a worldly man.

   When  he has reached that point of abstraction the sense centers  of  the
desire body commence to revolve slowly within the dense body,  and will thus
make  a place for themselves.   This in time will become more and  more  de-
fined, and it will require less and less effort to set them going.

   The subject of concentration may be any high and lofty ideal,  but should
preferably  be of such a nature that it takes the aspirant out of the  ordi-
nary things of sense,  beyond time and space; and there is no better formula
than the first five verses of St. John's gospel.   Taking them as a subject,
sentence by sentence,  morning after morning, will in time give the aspirant
a  wonderful  insight into the beginning of our universe and the  method  of
creation--an insight for beyond any book learning.

   After a time,  when the aspirant has learned to unwaveringly hold  before
him for about five minutes the idea upon which he is concentrating,  he  may
try  to suddenly drop the idea and leave a blank.   Think of  nothing  else,
simply  wait to see if anything enters the vacuum.   In time the sights  and
scenes of the desire world will fill the vacant space.   After the  aspirant
has become used to that,  he may demand this,  that,  or the other thing  to
come before him.  It will come and then he may investigate it.


[PAGE 700]                                      ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION

   The main point,  however, is that BY FOLLOWING THE ABOVE INSTRUCTIONS THE
ASPIRANT IS PURIFYING HIMSELF;  HIS AURA COMMENCES TO SHINE AND WILL WITHOUT
FAIL DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE TEACHER who will depute someone to give  help
when  required for the next step in advancement.   Even if months  or  years
should  go by and bring no VISIBLE result,  rest assured that no effort  has
been in vain;  the Great Teachers see and appreciate our efforts.   They are
just as anxious to have our assistance as we are to work.  They may see rea-
sons  which make it inexpedient for us to take up work for humanity in  this
life or at this time.   Sometime the hindering conditions will pass,  and we
shall be admitted to the light were we can see for ourselves.

   An  ancient  legend says that digging for treasure must be  done  in  the
stillness  of  night and in perfect silence;   to speak one word  until  the
treasure is safely excavated will inevitably cause it to disappear.  That is
a  mystic parable which has reference to the search for spiritual  illumina-
tion.   If we gossip or recount to others the experiences of our  concentra-
tion hour,  we lose them; they can not bear vocal transmission and will fade
into nothingness.   By meditation we must extract from them a full knowledge
of the underlying cosmic laws.   Then the experience itself will not be  re-
counted,  for we shall see that it is but the husk which hid the  kernel  of
worth.   The law is of universal value as will be at once apparent,  for  it
will  explain facts in life,  and teach us how to take advantage of  certain
conditions  and  to  avoid others.   The law may be  freely  stated  at  the
discoverer's discretion for the benefit of humanity.   The experience  which
revealed  the  law  then  will  appear  in its true light as of only passing


[PAGE 701]                                     MORNING AND EVENING EXERCISES

interest and unworthy of further notice.  Therefore, THE ASPIRANT SHOULD RE-
GARD EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS DURING CONCENTRATION AS SACRED AND SHOULD  KEEP
IT STRICTLY TO HIMSELF.

   Finally,  BEWARE OF REGARDING THE EXERCISES AS A BURDENSOME TASK.   ESTI-
MATE THEM AT THEIR TRUE WORTH;  THEY ARE OUR HIGHEST PRIVILEGE.   Only  when
thus regarded can we do them justice and reap the full benefits from them.
                      _________________________________

                        CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF THE
                            FELLOWSHIP TEACHINGS

   Although  the word "Rosicrucian"  is used by several  organizations,  The
Rosicrucian Fellowship has no connection with any of them.

   In  the years 1907-08,  after being tested for sincerity of  purpose  and
selfless desire to aid his fellowmen, Max Heindel was selected by the Broth-
ers of the Rose Cross to give out publicly the Western Wisdom Teachings  and
thus help prepare humanity for the coming Age of Universal Brotherhood.   By
means of intense self-discipline and devotion to service he earned the  sta-
tus of Lay Brother (Initiate) in the exalted Rosicrucian Order.

   Under the direction of the Brothers of the Rose Cross,  spiritual  giants
of  the human race,  Max Heindel wrote THE ROSICRUCIAN COSMO-CONCEPTION,  an
epoch-making book which has now become the Western World's leading  textbook
on  occultism.   By means of his own spiritual development he  was  able  to
verify for himself much that was given in the COSMO-CONCEPTION,  as well  as
to  gain  additional knowledge that later become embodied  in  his  numerous
books.

   One  of the basic conditions on which the Western Wisdom  Teachings  were
given to Max Heindel was that no price should be set on them.   This  condi-
tion  was faithfully observed by him to the end of his life,  and has  since
been  carefully observed by those directing the affairs of  the  Rosicrucian
Fellowship.   Although  the Fellowship books are  sold,  the  correspondence
courses and the service of our Healing Department have been kept on the free
will offering plan.  There are no membership fees.
