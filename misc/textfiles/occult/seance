-----------------------------------

What is a seance?
A seance or spirit-circle is the 
assembling together of a given
number of persons for the purpose
of seeking communication with the
Spirits who have passed away from
earth into the Higher World of
Souls.

-----------------------------------

Proper conditions-
The people who attend a seance
should be, as far as possible, of 
opposite temperaments, as positive
and negative in disposition whether
male or female; also of moral
characters, pure minds, and not
marked by repulsive points of
either physical or mental condition
Every one present should have a
positive mind so that phenomena
may occur.

How many people-
Never less than 3
and no more than 12

Proper room temperature
Never allow a room to overheat..
Ventilate such a room.

Proper lighting
Avoid strong light.
A subdued light is best.

Positions<where to sit>
If the circle is one that meets
periodically, and is composed of
the smae persons let them occupy
the same seats <Unless changed
under spiritual direction>, and sit
<as the most favorable positions>
round a table, thier hands laid on
it, with palms downwards.  It is
believed that the wood when charged
becomes a conductor, without the
necessity of touching or holding
or hands.

Which items should not be here-
If flowers or fruit are in the room
see that they are just freshly
gathered otherwise remove them;
also avoid sitting in a room with
many minerals, metals or glasses.

How to begin-
The seance should be opened either
by prayer or music, vocal or
instrumental; after which, subdued
quiet and harmonizing conversation
should take place. Always direct it
towards the purpose of the
gathering.  Never sink into other
topics.  Let it be quiet and gentle
<the conversation> until phenomena
begins to manifest.  Its a good
idea to have pen and paper ready
So that you wont have to rise to
the occasion later.

Best time-
Fix your circle at a time when
you will not be interrupted and
do not fail in your apointments
with the spirit.

Never!
let the circle last more than two
hours.  But always extend one too
one hour even if nothing happens.

HINT
If you feel the urge to say
something do so.  It may be a
spirit communicating.
