				 INTRODUCTION

	You hold in your hands one the Great Books of our century fnord.
	
	Some Great Books are recognized at once with a fusilade of critical
huzzahs and gonfolons, like Joyce's ULYSSES. Others appear almost furtively
and are only discovered 50 years later, like MOBY DICK or Mendel's great
essay on genetics. The PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA entered our space-time continuum
almost as unobtrusively as a cat-burglar creeping over a windowsill.

	In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book. In
1970,hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking the
identity of the mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger. Rumors swept
across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from Seattle to St.
Joe. Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts,one heard. No,said another legend
-- the PRINCIPIA was actually the work of the Sufi Order. A third, very
intriguing myth held that Malaclypse was a pen-name for Richard M. Nixon,
who had allegedly composed the PRINCIPIA during a few moments of lucidity.
I enjoyed each of these yards and did my part to help spread them. I was
also careful never to contradict the occasional rumors that I had actually
written the whole thing myself during an acid trip.

	The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly. By the mid-1970's,
thousands of people, some as far off as Hong Kong and Australia, were
talking about the PRINCIPIA, and since the original was out of print by
then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and there.

	When the ILLUMINATUS trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author, Bob
Shea, and I bothy received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by the
quotes from the PRINCIPIA with which we had decorated the heads of several
chapters. Many, who had already heard of the PRINCIPIA or seen copies,
asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we had copies availible. Others
wrote to ask if it were real, or just something we had invented the way
H.P> Lovecraft invented the NECRONOMICON. We answered according to our
moods, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes spreading the most Godawful
lies and myths we could devise fnord.

	Why not? We felt that this book was a true Classic (literatus
immortalis) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet
discovered it, the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage
the mythology and the controversy about it. Increasingly, people wrote
to ask  me if Timothy Leary had written it, and I almost always told
them he had, except on Fridays whem I am more whimsical, in which case
I told them it had been transmitted by a canine intellgence --
vast,cool,and unsympathic -- from the Dog Star, Sirius.
	Now, at last, the truth can be told.
	Actually, the PRINCIPIA is the work of a time-travelling
anthropologist from the 23rd Century. He is currently passing among us
as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory
Hill. He has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic
poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the
mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great
Seal of the United States.
	I have it on good authority that he is one of the most
accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many
times int he past,using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias,
Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc.
Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts
to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th Century Earthman
and that all my ideas about his extraterrrestrial and extratemporal
origin and delusions. Hah! I am not that easily deceived. After all, a
time-travelling anthropologist would say just that, so that he could
observe us without his presense causing cultureshock.
	I understand that he has consented to write an Afterward to
this edition. He'll probably contradict everything I've told you, but
don't believe a word he says fnord. He is a master of the deadpan
put-on, the plausible satire, the philosophical leg-pull and all the
branches of guerilla ontology.
	For full benefit to the Head, this book should be read in
conjunction with THE ILLUMINOIDS by Neal Wilgus (Sun Press,
Albuquerque, NM) and ZEN WITHOUT ZEN MASTERS by Camden Benares (And/Or
Press, Berkeley, California). "We are operating on many levels here",
as Ken Kesey used to say.
	In conclusion, there is no conclusion. Things go on as they
always have, getting weirder all the time.
	Hail Eris. All hail Discordia. Fnord?

GREATER POOP:Are you really serious or what?
MAL-2: Sometimes I take humor seriously. Sometimes I take seriousness
humorously. Either way it is irrelevant.

GP: Maybe you are just crazy.
M2: Indeed! But do not reject these teaching as false because I am crazy. The
reason that I am crazy is because they are true.

GP: Is Eris true?
M2: Everything is true.
GP: Even false things?
M2: Even false things are true.
GP: How can that be?
M2: I don't know man, I didn't do it.

GP: Why do you deal with so many negatives?
M2: To dissolve them.
GP: Will you develop that point?
M2: No.

GP: Is there an essential meaning behind POEE?
M2: There is a Zen Story about a student who asked a Master to explain the
meaning of Buddhism. The Master's reply was "Three pounds of flax."
GP: Is that the answer to my question?
M2: No, of course not. That is just illustrative. The answer to your question
is FIVE TONS OF FLAX!

The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth Year
of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while building a sun
deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they were written in a
mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours of intensive scrutiny he
discerned that the message could be read by standing on his head and viewing
it upside down.

A ZEN STORY

by Camden Benares, The Count of Five
Headmaster, Camp Meeker Cabal

A serious young man found the conflicts of mid 20th Century America confusing.
He went to many people seeking a way of resolving within himself the discords
that troubled him, but he remained troubled.
					     One night in a coffee house, a
self-ordained Zen Master said to him, "go to the dilapidated mansion you will
find at this address which I have written down for you. Do not speak to those
who live there; you must remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go
to the large room on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position
on top of the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate."
	He did just as the Zen Master instructed. His meditation was
frequently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the resr of the
plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join the pipes
and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how would he know when the moon
rose on the next night. He worried about what the people who walked through
the room said about him.
                         His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as
if in a test of his faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that
time two people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man
was sitting there was. The second replied "Some say he is a holy man. Others
say he is a shithead."
		       Hearing this, the man was enlightened.

		   -  THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT -
THE REVELATION

	Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-sixties, when Sputnik was
alone and new, and about the time that Ken Kesey took his first acid trip as
a medical volunteer; before underground newspapers, Viet Nam, and talk of a
second American Revolution; in the comparative quiet of the late
nineteen-fifties, just before the idea of RENAISSANCE became relevant....

	Two young Californians, known later as Omar Ravenhurst and
Malaclypse the Younger, were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee at
an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the world's problems. This
particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and they were
complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt in their
respective lives. "Solve the problem of discord," said one, "and all other
problems will vanish." "Indeed," said the other, "chaos and strife are the
roots of all confusion."


			 FIRST I MUST SPRINKLE YOU
			      WITH FAIRY DUST

Suddenly the place became devoid of light. Then an utter silence enveloped
them, and a great stillness was felt. Then came a blinding flash of intense
light, as though their very psyches had gone nova. Then vision returned.

	The two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several minutes.
They looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like statues in a
variety of comic positions, and that a bowling ball was steadfastly anchored
to the floor only inches from the pins that it had been sent to scatter. The
two looked at each other, totally unable to account for the phenomenon. The
condition was one of suspension, and one noticed that the clock had stopped.


There walked into the room a chimpanzee, shaggy and grey about the muzzle,
yet upright to his full five feet, and poised with natural majesty. He
carried a scroll and walked to the young men.

"Gentlemen," he said, "why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse orbit?
Gentlemen, there are nipples on your chests; do you give milk? And what,
pray tell, Gentlemen, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?" He paused.
"SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!"

And with that he revealed his scroll. It was a diagram, like a yin-yang with
a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other. And then he exploded and
the two lost consciousness.

ERIS - GODDESS OF CHAOS, DISCORD & CONFUSION

	They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, and found the bowlers
engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee. It was
apparant that their experience had been private.
	
	They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from memory
the chimpanzee's diagram. Over the next five days they searched libraries to
find the significance of it, but were disappointed to uncover only
references to Taoism, the Korean flag, and Technocracy. It was not until
they traced the Greek writing on the apple that they discoveredthe ancient
Goddess known to the Greeks as ERIS and to the Romans as DISCORDIA. This was
on the fifth night, and when they slept that night wach had a vivid dream of
a splendid woman whose eyes were as soft as feather and as deep as eternity
itself, and whose body was the spectacular dance of atoms and universes.
Pyrotechnics of pure energy formed her flowing hair, and rainbows manifested
and dissolved as she spoke in a warm and gentle voice:

I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness
left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this development
approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding.

You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor, and clad in them, your
vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy and painful, your skin is
bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the sun.

I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build
rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy
anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.

	During the next months they studied philosophies and theologies, and
learned that ERIS or DISCORDIA was primarily feared by the ancients as being
disruptive. Indeed, the very concept of chaos was still considered
equivalent to strife and treated as a negative. "No wonder things are all
screwed up," they concluded, "they have got it all backwards." They found
that the principle of disorder was every much as significant as the
principle of order.

	With this in mind, they studied the strange yin-yang. During a
meditation one afternoon, a voice came to them:

It is called THE SACRED CHAO. I appoint you Keepers of It. Therein you will
find anything you like. Speak of Me as DISCORD, to show contrast to the
pentagon. Tell constricted mankind that there are no rules, unless they
choose to invent rules. Keep close the words of Syadasti: 'TIS AN ILL WIND
THAT BLOWS NO MINDS. And remember that there is no tyranny in the State of
Confusion. For further information, consult your pineal gland.

	"What is this?" mumbled one to the other, "A religion based on The
Goddess of Confusion? It is utter madness!"

	And with those words, each looked at the other in absolute awe. Omar
began to giggle. Mal began to laugh. Omar began to jump up and down. Mal was
hooting and hollering to beat all hell. And amid squeals of mirth and with
tears on their cheeks, each appointed the other to be high priest of his own
madness, and together they declared themselves to be a society of Discordia,
for what ever that may turn out to be.

Her Apple Corps is strong!

Her Apple Corps is strong!

VERSE
She was not invited to the party that they held on Limbo Peak;*
So She threw a Golden Apple, 'dted of turn'd t'other cheek!
O it cracked the Holy Punchbowl and it made the nectar leak;
Her Apple Corps is strong!

"Ol' Limb' Peak."

ON PRAYER

Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to Eris. He
replied with these words:

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous. Charles Fort has
listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with, say, a
drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the entire village
wiped out in a torrential flood.

		     What We Know About ERIS  (not much)

The Romans left a likeness of Her for posterity-- She was shown as a grotesque
woman with a pale and ghastly look, Her eyes afire, Her garment ripped and
torn, and women look pale and ghastly when concealing a chilly dagger in their
bosoms.

Her geneology is from the Greeks and is utterly confused. Either She was the
twin of Ares and the daughter of Zeus and Hera; or She was the daughter of
Nyx, goddess of night (who was either the daughter or wife of Chaos, or both),
and Nyx's brother, Erebus, and whose brothers and sisters include Death, Doom,
Mockery, and Friendship. And that She begat Forgetfullness, Quarrels, Lies,
and a bunch of gods and goddesses like that.

One day Mal-2 consulted his Pineal Gland* and asked Eris if She really created
all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old
Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. "They were,"
She added, "victims of indigestion, you know."

Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But She is
mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.

*THE PINEAL GLAND is where each and every one of us can talk to Eris. If you
have trouble activating your Pineal, then try the appendix which does almost
as well. Reference: DOGMA I, METAPHYSICS #3, "The Indoctrine of the Pineal
Gland"

			      THE INSIDE STORY!

       The Law of Fives

	the Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees. It was first
revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great contributions to come from
The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.
	POEE suscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect. And POEE also
recognizes the holy 23 (2+3=5) that is incorporated by Episkopos Dr. Mordecai
Malignatus, KNS, into his Discordian sect, The Ancient Illuminated Seers of
Bavaria. 
	The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO 5.
	The Law of Fives is never wrong.
	In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find the
Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

"You will find that the State is the kind of ORGANIZATION which, though it

		      THE MYTH OF THE APPLE OF DISCORD
	It seems that Zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for Peleus and
Thetis and did not want to invite Eris because of Her reputation as a
trouble maker.*
	This made Eris angry, and so She fashioned an apple of pure gold**
and inscribed upon it KALLISTI ("To The Prettiest One") and on the day of
the fete She rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be alone and
joyously partake of a hot dog.
	Now, three of the invited goddesses,*** Athena, Hera, and Aphrodite,
each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the inscription.
And they started fighting, and they started throwing punch all over the
place and everything.
	Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator must
be selected, which was a reasonable suggestion, and all agreed. He sent them
to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his mother had had a lot
of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of the sneaky goddesses tried
to outwit the others by going early and offering a bribe to Paris.
	Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great
Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him the Most Beautiful Woman on Earth. Being a
healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's bribe and she
got the apple and he got screwed.
	As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happeningsso that Paris
could have Helen (The Helen) then living with her husband Menelaus,King of
Sparta. Anyway, everyone knows that the Trojan War followed when Sparta
demanded their Queen back and that the Trojan War is said to be The First
War among men.
	And so we suffer because of the Original Snub. And so a Discordian
is to partake of No Hot Dog Buns.
	Do you believe that?
-------------------------------------
* This is called THE DOCTRINE OF THE ORIGINAL SNUB
** There is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of
metalica gold or acapulco.
*** Actually there were five goddesses, but the Greeks did not know the Law
of Fives.

The official symbol of POEE is here illustrated. It may be this, or any
similar device to represent TWO OPPOSING ARROWS CONVERGING INTO A COMMON
POINT. It may be vertical, horizontal, or else such, and it may be elaborated
or simplified as desired.

The esoteric name for this symbol is THE FIVE FINGERED HAND OF ERIS, commonly
shortened to THE HAND.

NOTE: In the lore of western magic, the \/ is taken to symbolize horns,
especially the horns of Satan or of diabolical beasties. The Five Fingered
Hand of Eris, however, is not intended to be taken as satanic, for the
"horns" are supported by another set, of inverted "horns". Or maybe it is
walrus tusks. I don't know what it is, to tell the truth.

POEE (pronounced "POEE") is an acronym for The PARATHEO-ANAMETAMYSTIKHOOD OF
ERIS ESOTERIC. The first part can be taken to mean "equivalent
deity,reversity beyond-mystique." We are not really esoteric, it's just that
nobody pays much attention to us.

MY HIGH REVERENCE MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER, AB, DD, KSC, is the High Priest of
POEE, and POEE is grounded in his episkopotic revelations of The Goddess. He
is called [The Omnibenevolent Polyfather of Virginity in Gold].

The POEE HEAD TEMPLE is the Joshua Norton Cabal of The Discordian Society,
which is located in Mal-2's pineal gland and can be found by temporally and
spacially locating the rest of Mal-2.

POEE has no treasury, no by-laws, no articles, no guides save Mal-2's pineal
gland, and has only one scruple-- which Mal-2 keeps on his key chain.

POEE has not registered,incorporated, or otherwise chartered with the State,
and so the State does not recognize POEE or POEE Ordinations, which is only
fair, because POEE does not recognize the State.

POEE has 5 DEGREES:
	There is the neophyte, or LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLE.
	The LEGIONNAIRE DEACON, who is catching on.
	An Ordained POEE PRIEST/PRIESTESS or a CHAPLIN.
	The HIGH PRIEST, the Polyfather.
	And POEE =POPE=.

POEE LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLES are authorized to initiate others as Discordian
Society Legionnaires. PRIESTS appoint their own DEACONS. The POLYFATHER
ordains priests. I don't know about the =POPES=.

POEE & It's Priests

If you like Erisianism as it is presented according to Mal-2, then you may
wish to from your own POEE CABAL as a POEE PRIEST and you can go do a bunch of
POEE Priestly Things. A "POEE Cabal" is exactly what you think it is.

The High Priest makes no demands on his Priests, though he does rather expect
good will of them. The Office of The Polyfather is point, not to teach. Once
in a while, he even listens.

Should you find that your own revelations of The Goddess become substantially
different that the revelations of Mal-2, then perhaps the Goddess has plans
for you as an Episkopos, and you might consider creating your own sect from
scratch, unhindered. Episkoposes are not competing with each other, and they
are all POEE priests anyway (as soon as I locate them). The point is that
Episkoposes are developing separate paths to the Erisian mountain top. See the
section "Discordian Society"

ORDINATION AS A POEE PRIEST

There are no particular qualifications for Ordination because if you want to
be a POEE Priest then you must undoubtedly qualify. Who could possibly know
better than you whether or not you should be Ordained?

An ORDAINED POEE PRIEST or PRIESTESS is defined as "one who holds an
Ordination Certificate from the Office of the Polyfather."


	Seek into the Chao if thou wouldst be wise
	And find ye delight in Her Great Surprise!

Note to POEE Priests:

The Polyfather wishes to remind all Erisians the POEE was conceived not as a
commercial enterprise, and that you are requested to keep your cool when
seeking funds for POEE Cabals or when spreading the POEE Word via the market
place.


The Hidden stone ripens fast,

			  HOW TO START A POEE CABAL
		  WITHOUT MESSING AROUND WITH THE POLYFATHER

If you can't find the Polyfather, or having found him, don't want anything to
do with him, you are still authorized to form your own POEE CABAL and do
Priestly Things, using the Principia Discordia as a guide. Your Official Rank
will be POEE CHAPLIN for the LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD, which is exactly the
same as a POEE PRIEST except that you don't have an Ordination Certificate.
The words you are now reading are your ordination.

HOW TO BECOME A POEE CHAPLIN

1. Write the ERISIAN AFFIRMATION in five copies.
2. Sign and nose-print each copy.
3. Send one to the President of the United States.
4. Send one to
	The California State Bureau of Furniture and Bedding
	1021 'D' Street, Sacramento CA 94814
5. Nail one to a telephone pole. Hide one. And burn the other.
Then consult your pineal gland.

Trip 5!

			 = The POEE Baptismal Rite =
 This Mysteree Rite is not required for initiation, but it is offered by many
POEE Priests to proselytes who desire a formal ceremony.

1) The Priests and four Brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the Initiate
in the center facing the Priests. If possible, the Brothers on the immediate
right and left of the Priest should be Deacons. The Initiate must be totally
naked, to demonstrate that he is truly a human being and not something else in
disguise like a cabbage or something.

2) All persons in the audience and the pentagon, excepting the Priest, assume
a squatting position and return to a standing position. This is repeated four
more times. This dance is symbolic of the humility of we Erisians.

3) The Priest begins:

   I, (complete Holy Name, with Mystical Titles, and degrees, designations,
offices, &tc.), Ordained Priest of the Paratheo-anametamystikhood of Eris
Esoteric, with the Authority invested at me by the High Priest of It, Office
of the Polyfather, The House of the Rising Podge, POEE Head Temple; Do
herewith Require of Ye:

	1) ARE YE A HUMAN BEING AND NOT A CABBAGE OR SOMETHING? The Initiate
answers YES.
	2) THAT'S TOO BAD. DO YE WISH TO BETTER THYSELF? The Initiate answers
YES.
	3) HOW STUPID. ARE YE WILLING TO BECOME PHILOSOPHICALLY ILLUMINIZED?
He answers YES.
	4) VERY FUNNY. WILL YE DEDICATE YESELF TO THE HOLEY ERISIAN MOVEMENT?
The Initiate answers PROBABLY.
	5) THEN SWEAR YE THE FOLLOWING AFTER ME:
(The Priest here leads the Initiate in a recital of THE ERISIAN AFFIRMATION.)
The Priest continues: THEN I DO HERE PROCLAIM YE POEE DISCIPLE (name),
LEGIONNAIRE OF THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD. HAIL ERIS! HAIL HAIL! HAIL YES!

4) All present rejoice grandly. The new Brother opens a large jug of wine and
offers it to all who are present.

5) The Ceremony generally degenerates.

			 NO TWO EQUALS ARE THE SAME!

			    THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY

The Discordian Society has no definition.

I sometimes think of it as a disorganization of Eris Freaks. It has been
called a guerrilla mind theatre. Episkopos Randomfactor, Director of Purges of
Our People's Underworld Movement sect in Larchmont, prefers "The World's
Greatest Association of What-ever-it-is-that-we-are." Lady Mal thinks of it as
a RENAISSANCE THINK TANK. Fang the Unwashed, WKC, won't say. You can think of
it any way you like.

AN EPISKOPOS OF THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY
is one who prefers total autonomy, and creates his own Discordian sect as The
Goddess directs him. He speaks for himself and for those that say that they
like what he says.

THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD:
A Discordian Society Legionnaire is one who prefers not to create his own
sect. 

If you want in on the Discordian Society then declare yourself what you wish
do what you like and tell us about it or if you prefer don't.

There are no rules anywhere.            Some Episkoposes
The Goddess Prevails.			have a one-man cabal.
					Some work together.
					Some never do explain.

			 THE PARABLE OF THE BITTER TEA
				      by
		       Rev. Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P.
			  POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal

	When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there into
the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in his
endevor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left standing from the
night before, when he had in his weakness forgot about its making and had let
it sit steeping for 24 hours. It was dark and murky and it was Hypoc's
intention to use this old tea by diluting it with water. And again in his
weakness, chose without further consideration and plunged into the physical
labor of the preparations. It was then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of
that trip, he had a sudden loud clear voice in his head saying "it is bitter
tea that involves you so." Hypoc heard the voice, but the struggle inside

and the muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded, continued to
exert their influence and Hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied the

A SERMON ON ETHICS AND LOVE

	One day Mal-2 asked the messenger spirit Saint Gulik to approach the
Goddess and request Her presence for some desperate advice. Shortly afterwards
the radio came on by itself, and an ethereal female Voice said YES?

	"O! Eris! Blessed Mother of Man! Queen of Chaos! Daughter of Discord!
Concubine of Confusion! O! Exquisite Lady, I beseech You to lift a heavy burden
from my heart!"

	WHAT BOTHERS YOU, MAL? YOU DON'T SOUND WELL.

	"I am filled with fear and tormented with terrible visions of pain.
Everywhere people are hurting one another, the planet is rampant with
injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers
imprison sons, children perish while brothers war. O, woe."

	WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT, IF IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

	"But nobody Wants it! Everybody hates it."

	OH. WELL, THEN STOP.

	At which moment She turned herself into an aspirin commercial and left
The Polyfather stranded alone with his species.

only Love Vibrations in return. But we of the POEE sect know that Patamunzo is
the Real Imposter, and that those vibrations of his are actually an attempt to
subvert Dr. Mojo's rightful apostilic authority by shaking him out of his wits.

			  THE HONEST BOOK OF TRUTH
		   being a BIBLE of The Erisian Movement

			 and How it was Revealed to
	  Episkopos LORD OMAR KHAYYAM RAVENHURST, KSC; Bull Goose
	of Limbo; and Master Pastor of the Church Invisible of
	the Laughing Christ, Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus,
		  Laughing Buddha Jesus [LBJ] Ranch


		    From the Honest Book of Truth
		 THE BOOK OF EXPLANATIONS, Chapter 1

1. There came one day to Lord Omar, Bull Goose of Limbo, a Messenger
of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Mound wherein was buried an
Honest Book.

2. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and dig the
Truth, that ye may come to know it and, knowing it, spread it and,
spreading it, wallow in it and, wallowing in it, lie in it and ,lying
in the Truth, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings -- an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

3. So Omar went forth to the Sacred Mound, which was to the East of
Mullah, and thereupon he worked diiging in the sand for five days and
five nights, but found no book.

4. At the end of five days and five nights of digging, it came to pass
that Omar was exhausted. So he put his shovel to one side and bedded
himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he had
uncovered on the first day of his labors.

5. Omar slept.

6. On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, and
there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in the
Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove wherein
was hidden a Golden Chest.

7. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and lift the
Stash, that ye may come to own it and ,owning it, share it and,
sharing it, love in it and ,loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in
the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

8. But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel: What is this shit,man?
What care I for the Word and Sayings? What care I for the Inspiration
of all men? Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods
when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better
wages?

9. And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricked down to the
Ground by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five
nights.

10. And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt, and in his
Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a
Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box
containing many filing cards, some of them in packs with rubber bands
around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon
others nothing was written.

11. Thereupon the Angel Commanded to Lord: Take ye this Honest Book of
Truth to thine bosom and cherish it. Carry it forth into The Land and
Lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage. Preach from
it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and repent.

			  CONVENTIONAL CHAOS

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted
the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he
said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was
a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.

It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the
disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway,
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more
seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes
frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip. Man
has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

		DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY"*

			  THE BOOK OF UTERUS
		    from the Honest Book of Truth
			revealed to Lord Omar

1. Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao, balanced in Oblivion by the
Perfect Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge.

2. Whereupon, by an Act of Happenstance, the Hodge began gradually to
overpower the Podge -- and the Primal Chaos thereby came to be.

3. So in the beginning was the Primal Chaos, balanced on the Edge of Oblivion
by the Perfect Counterpullpush of the Podge and the Hodge.

4. Whereupon, by the Law of Negative Reversal,** the Podge swiftly
underpowered the Hodge and Everything broke loose.

5. And therein emerged the Active Force of Discord, the Subtle Manifestation
of the Nonexistent Chao, to guide Everything along the Path back to Oblivion
- that it might not become lost among Precepts of Order in the Region of
Thud.

6. Forasmuch as it was Active, the Force of Discord entered the State of
Confusion, wherein It copulated with the Queen and begat ERIS, Our Lady of
Discord and Gross Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao.

7. And under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence called
Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, and was hence
called Discordia.

8. By the by it came to pass that the Establishment of Bureaucracy perished
in a paper shortage.

9. Thus it was, in accord with the Law of Laws.

10. During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy was the
Aftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, computations, and
reckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in Acceptance and
Preparation for the Return to Oblivion to be followed by a Repetition of the
Universal Absurdity. Moreover, of Itself the Coming of Aftermath waseth a
Resurrection of the Freedom-flowing Chaos. HAIL ERIS!

11. Herein was set into motion the Eristic Pattern, which would Repeat Itself
Five Times Over Seventy-three Times, after which nothing would happen.

THE FIVE ORDERS OF DISCORDIA ("THEM")
Gen. Pandaemonium, Commanding

The seeds of the ORDERS OF DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his early
disciples. They form the skeleton of the Aneristic Movement, which over
emphasizes the Principle of Order and is antagonistic to the necessary
compliment, the Principle of Disorder. The Orders are composed of persons all
hung up on authority, security and control; i.e., they are blinded by the
Aneristic Illusion. They do not know that they belong to Orders of Discordia.
But we know.

1. The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This is for all
the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world.

2. The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved for
lawmakers, censors, and like ilk.

3. The Acedemic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit schools
and universities, and dominate many of them.

4. The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS. This is
mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military, political,
acedemic and sacred Orders.

5. The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about the D.L.,
but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by Greyface himself.
It is known that they now have absolute domination over all organized churches
in the world. It is also believed that they have been costuming cabbages and
passing them off as human beings.

A person belonging to one or more Order is just as likely to carry a flag of
the counter-establishment as the flag of the establishment-- just as long as it
is a flag.

THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM BERGAN EVANS
ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST

	The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy.
Probablility is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics. Entropy comes
from physics. It is the assertion-- established logically and experimentally--
that the universe, by its nature, is "running down", moving toward a state of
inert uniformity devoid of form, matter, hierarchy or differentiation.

	That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos, is
overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order.

	The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is expressed
in the second law of thermodynamics-- perhaps the most pessimistic and amoral
formulation in all human thought.

	It applies however, to a closed system, to something that is an
isolated whole, not just a part. Within such systems there may be parts, which
draw their energy from the whole, that are moving at least temporarily, in the
opposite direction; in them order is increasing and chaos is diminishing.

	The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main current
are called "enclaves". And one of them is life, especially human life, which in
a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards increased order.

This is slightly less than the actual distance because we have not yet
considered earth's atmosphere. So be it. Christopher Garth, Evanston

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			   THE SACRED CHAO

THE SACRED CHAO is the key to illumination. Devised by the Apostle Hung Mung
in ancient China, it was modified and popularized by the Taoists and is
sometimes called the YIN-YANG. The Sacred Chao is not the Yin-Yang of the
Taoists. It is the HODGE-PODGE of the Erisians. And, instead of a Podge spot
on the Hodge side, it has a PENTAGON which symbolizes the ANERISTIC
PRINCIPLE, and instead of a Hodge spot on the Podge side, it depicts the
GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORDIA to symbolize the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know about
absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes everything not worth
knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge.

HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.

	The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic
Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man made
concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper
that is the level of distinction making.

	With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality
through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The
ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened
people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other
cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality
which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the
level of concept.

	We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids
(concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group
of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and
relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is
in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.

	Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one
grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one
that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened
westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the
ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more
beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be
more True than any other.

	DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some
particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like
female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of
female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically
arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

	The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow
wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the
ERISTIC ILLUSION.

	The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition
relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T)
Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid,
and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick
another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and
disordered. 
	
	Reality is the original Rorschach.

Verily! So much for all that.

The words of the Foolish and those of the Wise
Are not far apart in Discordian Eyes.
(HBT; The Book of Advise, 2:1)

The PODGE of the Sacred Chao is symbolized as The Golden Apple of Discordia,
which represents the Eristic Principle of Disorder. The writing on it,
"KALLISTI" is Greek for "TO THE PRETTIEST ONE" and refers to an old myth about
The Goddess. But the Greeks had only a limited understanding of Disorder, and
thought it to be a negative principle.

The Pentagon represents the Aneristic Principle of Order and symbolizes the
HODGE. The Pentagon has several references; for one,, it can be taken to
represent geometry, one of the earliest studies of formal order to reach
elaborate development;* for another, it specifically accords with THE LAW OF
FIVES. 

THE TRUTH IS FIVE BUT MEN HAVE ONLY ONE NAME FOR IT.
				-Patamunzo Lingananda

It is also the shape of the United States Military Headquarters, the Pentagon
Building, a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order resting on a
firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into dazzling disorder; and
this building is one of our more cherished Erisian Shrines. Also it so happens
that in times of medieval magic, the pentagon was the generic symbol for
werewolves, but this reference is not particularly intended and it should be
noted that the Erisian Movement does not discriminate against werewolves-- our
membership roster is open to persons of all races, national origins and
hobbies.

			       BRUNSWICK SHRINE

In the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier there lives a bowling alley, and within
this very place, in the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3125 (1959*), Eris revealed
Herself to The Golden Apple Corps for the first time.

In honor of this Incredible Event, this Holy Place is revered as a Shrine by
all Erisians. Once every five years, the Golden Apple Corps plans a Pilgrimage
to Brunswick Shrine as an act of Devotion, and therein to partake of No Hot Dog
Buns, and ruminate a bit about It All.

It is written that when The Corps returns to The Shrine for the fifth time five
times over, than shall the world come to an end:

				IMPENDING DOOM
				  HAS ARRIVED
	And Five Days Prior to This Occasion The Apostle The Elder
	Malaclypse Shall Walk the Streets of Whittier Bearing a Sign
	for All Literates to Read thereof: "DOOM", as a Warning of
	Forthcoming Doom to All Men Impending. And He Shall Signal 
	This Event by Seeking the Poor and Distributing to Them Precious
	MAO BUTTONS and Whittier Shall be Known as The Region of Thud
	for These Five Days.

As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to us in
particular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning such a
Pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get around to actually
going.

Brother Ram,

Your acute observation that ERIS spelled backwards is SIRE, and your inference
to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here, have brought me to some
observations of my own,

ERIS spelled fore-part-aft-wards is RISE. And spelled inside out is REIS,
which is a unit of money, albeit Portugese-Brazilian and no longer in use.
From this it may be concluded that Eris has usurped Eros (god of erotic love)
in the eyes of those who read backwards; which obviously made Eros sorE. Then
She apparently embezzeled the Olympian Treasury and went to Brazil; whereupon
She opened a chain of whorehouses (which certainly would get a rise from the
male population). I figure it to be this in particular because MADAM reads the
same forwards and backwards. And further, it is a term of great respect,
similar to SIRE.

And so thank you for your insight, it may well be the clue to the mystery of
just where Eris has been fucking around for 3125.

		     DOGMA III - HISTORY #2, "COSMOGONY"
which is not the same as DOGMA I - METAPHYSICS #2, "COSMOLOGY" (Book of Uterus)

	In the beginning there was VOID, who had two daughters; one (the
smaller) was that of BEING, named ERIS, and one (the larger) was of NON-BEING,
named ANERIS. (To this day, the fundamental truth that Aneris is the larger is
apparent to all who compare the great number of things that do not exist with
the comparatively small number of things that do exist.)

	Eris had been born pregnant, and after 55 years (Goddesses have an
unusually long gestation period-- longer even than elephants), Her pregnancy
bore the fruits of many things. These things were composed of the Five Basic
Elements, SWEET, BOOM, PUNGENT, PRICKLE, and ORANGE. Aneris, however, had been
created sterile. When she saw Eris enjoying Herself so greatly with all of the
existant things She had borne, Aneris became jealous and finally one day she
stole some existant things and changed them into non-existant things and
claimed them as her own children. This deeply hurt Eris, who felt that Her
sister was unjust (being so much larger anyway) to deny Her her small joy. And
so She made herself swell again to bear more things. And She swore that no
matter how many of her begotten that Aneris would steal, She would beget more.
And, in return, Aneris swore that no matter how many existant things Eris
brought forth, she would eventually find them and turn them into non-existant
things for her own. (And to this day, things appear and disappear in this very
manner.) 

	At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of chaos
and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing with them and
ordered some of them just to see what would happen. Some pretty things arose
from this play and for the next five zillion years She amused Herself by
creating order. And so She grouped some things with others and some groups
with others, and big groups with little groups, and all combinations until She
had many grand schemes which delighted Her.

	Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed disorder
(previously not apparent because everything was chaos). There were many ways
in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was not.

	"Hah," She thought, "Here shall be a new game."

	And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in contest
games, and to take turns amusing each other. She named the side of disorder
after Herself, "ERISTIC" because Being is anarchic. And then, in a mood of
sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the other side "ANERISTIC" which
flattered Aneris and smoothed the friction a little that was between them. 

	Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed. He felt unsatisfied
for he had created only physical existence and physical non-existence, and had
neglected the spiritual. As he comtemplated this, a great Quiet was caused and
he went into a state of Deep Sleep which lasted for 5 eras. At the end of this
ordeal, he begat a brother to Eris and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had
no name at all.

	When the sisters heard this, they both confronted Void and pleaded
that he not froget them, his First Born. And so Void decreed thus:

	That this brother, having no form, was to reside with Aneris in
Non-Being and then to leave her and, so that he might play with order and
disorder, reside with Eris in Being. But Eris became filled with sorrow when
She heard this and then began to weep.

	"Why are you despondent?" demanded Void, "Your new brother will have
his share with you." "But Father, Aneris and I have been arguing, and she will
take him from me when she discovers him, and cause him to return to
Non-Being." "I see,"replied Void, "Then I decree the following:

	"When your brother leaves the residence of Being, he shall not reside
again in Non-Being, but shall return to Me, Void, from whence he came. You
girls may bicker as you wish, but My son is your Brother and We are all of
Myself." 

And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is that we
play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder them, and so it
shall be that non-existence shall take us back from existence and that
nameless spirituality shall return to Void, like a tired child home from a
very wild circus.

	       A POEE MYSTEREE RITE - THE SRI SYADASTIAN CHANT
		       Written, in some sense, by Mal-2

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This particular one is much
enhanced by the use of a Leader to chant the Sanskrit alone, with all
participants chanting the English. it also behooves one to be in a quiet frame
of mind and to be sitting in a still position, perhaps The Buttercup Position.
It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his gourd.

RUB-A-DUB-DUB
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Hung Mung.
SYA-DASTI
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Mo-jo.
SYA-DAVAK-TAVYA
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Zara-thud.
SYA-DASTI SYA-NASTI
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Elder Mal.
SYA-DASTI KAVAK-TAV-YASKA
O! Hail Eris. Blessed St. Gu-lik.
SYA-DASTI, SYA-NASTI, SYA-DAVAK-TAV-YASKA
O! Hail Eris. All Hail Dis-cord-ia.

It is then repeated indefinitely, or for the first two thousand miles, which
ever comes first.

The Classification of Saints

1. SAINT SECOND CLASS


To be reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example: St.Norton
the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico (his grave
near San Francisco is an official POEE shrine.)

THE FOLLOWING FOUR CATAGORIES ARE RESERVED FOR FICTIONAL BEINGS WHO, NOT BEING
ACTUAL, ARE MORE CAPABLE OF PERFECTION.

2. LANCE SAINT

Good Saint material and definitely inspiring.
Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller)

3. LIEUTENANT SAINT

Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint.
Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes)

4. BRIGADIER SAINT

Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following (fictional or
factual). Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut)

5. FIVE STAR SAINT

The Five Apostles of Eris.

Note: It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other about
Saints.


Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Herman Hesse. Only a
hand full understood Albert Einstein. And nobody understood Emperor Norton.

TESTS BY DOCTORS PROVE IT POSSIBLE TO SHRINK

				=ON OCCULTISM=

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have
sought higher conciousness through assimilation and control of universal
opposites-- good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc. But due to the
steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the ancient methods of the
shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is perhaps the two most important
pairs of apparent or earth-plane opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and
SERIOUS/HUMOROUS.

Magicians, and progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and their
subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an essential
metaphysical balance. when magicians learn to approach philosophy as a
malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn to appreciate the
absurdity of man's endeavours, then they will be able to pursue their art with
a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer understanding of it, and therefore
gain more effective magic. CHAOS IS ENERGY.

This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western occult
thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first breakthrough in
occultism since Solomon.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM

1) Om your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at precisely
midnight, noting your birth time and date of observation, count all visible
stars.

2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do next.


The Eminent 16th Century Mathemetician Cardan so detested Luther that he
altered Luther's birthdate to give him an unfavorable horoscope.



The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats at
random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names, it is
always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are opposite
their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of persons, and let
their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 "in such a way that the place
cards are numbered in sequence around the table. If a delegate D originally
sits down to a place card P, then the table must be rotated R steps before he
is correctly seated, where R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case
R=P-D+N. The collection of values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly
the integers 0 to N-1,each taken once, but so also is the collection of values
of R, or else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time.
Summing the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is
an integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It follows
that N=2K+1, an odd number." This contradicts the original assumption.
	"I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes, "for
a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of the
nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard where
diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one direction only.

			THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE
			  INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM

	To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to accept a
trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to choose the
creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip composed of both order
and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only accept creative disorder along
with, and equal to, creative order, and also willing to reject destructive
order as an undesirable equal to destructive disorder.

	The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into
order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of
building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential
positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive aspects
of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in the creative
uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate division.

	POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we work
toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order, is
possible and desireable; and that destructive order, like destructive
disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

	Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of all
ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		   ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE

Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the evil
Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians everywhere
for their just protection.

The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface and
his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function and that a
timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize their foundation.
The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract negative aneristic vibes and
if introduced into a neutral or positive aneristic setting (like a poet
working out word rhythms) it will prove harmless, or at worst, simply
annoying. It is not designed for use against negative eristic vibes, although
it can be used as an eristic vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a
negative setting into a misguided eristic setting. in this instance, it would
be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to manufacture the positive
vibrations if results are to be achieved. CAUTION- all magic is powerful and
requires courage and integrity on the part of the magician. This ritual, if
misused, can backfire. Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:

Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fisticuffs.
Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or towards the
direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize.
Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motionswith your hands
as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess. Chant, loudly and
clearly:
		   GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

		A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar

	The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the
ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an arguement by
asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you know that
God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should answer "Yes." then he
probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget it. If he says "No." then
quickly proceed to:
	THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is
ERIS!" Shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear him into
the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he does not
appear convinced, then proceed to:
	THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without Faith! I
sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
	THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know what
happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him that he
will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and distributed to the
poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean thing to say), just shake
your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from your eye, go to:
	THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord and
confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think did all of
this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal forces." then quickly
respond with:
	THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is absolutely
right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that Her name is ERIS.
If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate, then finally resort to:
	THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated people
like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an Ineffable
Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really more like a poem
than like a science and that he is liable to be turned into a Precious Mao
Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of Thud if he does not get
hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK

A GAME

by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS

SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.

PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing...
in water or mud or anything you; can sink something in.

RULES: Sinking is allowd in any manner. To date, ten pound chunks of mud were
used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water of a hole
to drop things in. But rivers - bays - gulfs - I dare say even oceans can be
used. 

TURNS are taken thusly: who somever gets the junk up and in the air first.

DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find more
objects to sink, once; one object is sunk.

UPON SINKING: The sinked shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as
thoughtful.

NAMING OF OBJECTS is some times desirable. The object is named by the finder
of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk Columbus,
Ohio!"

Plant your seeds.

In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall.
Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on it
first for that). For casual planting, its best to soak them in water for a day
and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep. Don't worry much
about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong and will try to wait
for nature. Don't soak them if its wintertime. Seeds are a very hearty life
form and strongly desire to grow and flourish. But some of them need people's
help to get started. Plant your seeds.

Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to friends of
yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even different countries.
If you would rather not, then please pass this copy on to someone and perhaps
they would like to.

THERE IS NO TRUTH
to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter then all sorts of
catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters will happen. Except, of
course, from your seed's point of view.

complain that ye lack FREEDOM!

2. Ye have cast out yer brothers for devils and now complain ye, lamenting,
that ye've been left to fight alone.

3. All Chaos was once yer kingdom; verily, held ye dominion over the entire
Pentaverse, but today ye was sore afraid in dark corners, nooks, and sink
holes.

4. O how the darknesses do crowd up, one against the other, in ye hearts! What
fear ye more that what ye have wroughten?

5. Verily, verily I say unto you, not all the Sinister Ministers of the
Bavarian Illuminati, working together in multitudes, could so entwine the land
with tribulation as have yer baseless warnings.

From: MAD MALIK Hauptscheissmeister

	Dear Brother Mal-2,

	In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use. And please
stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

	Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley slave
who ascended to the Throne of Valusia. Revived by Pelias of Koth, circa 10,000
B.C. Possibly it was he who taught the inner-teachings to Conan of Cimmeria
after Conan became King of Aquilonia. First brought to the western hemisphere
by Conan and taught to Mayan priesthood (Conan is Quetzlcoatl). That was 4
Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayan date. Revived by Abdul Alhazred in his infamous Al Azif,
circa 800 A.D. (Al Azif translated into Latin by Olaus Wormius, 1132 A.D., as
The Necronomicon.) In 1090 A.D. was the founding of The Ismaelian Sect
(Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with secret teachings based on Alhazred,
Pelias and Kull. Founding of the Illuminated Ones of Bavaria, by Adam
Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776. He based it on the others. Weishaupt brought it to
the United States during the period that he was impersonating George
Washington; and it was he who was the Man in Black who gave the design for The
Great Seal to Jeffersson in the garden that night. The Illuminated tradition
is now, of course, in the hands of The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria
(A.I.S.B.), headquartered here in the United States.

	Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication.
No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, Burroughs Nova Express, the King James translation of
the Holy Bible (though not the Latin or Hebrew), and The Blue Book. Not to
speak of Ben Franklin's private papers (!), but we are still suppressing
those.

	Considering current developments--you know the ones I speak of--it
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations. Your
publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old fronts like the
Masons, the Rothchild Banks, and the Federal Reserve System, we now have
significant control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (since Hoover died
last year, but that is still secret), the Students for a Democratic Society,
the Communist Party USA, the American Anarchist Assn., the Junior Chamber of
Commerce, the Black Lotus Society, the Republican Party, the John Dillinger
Die For You Society, and the Camp Fire Girls. It is still useful to continue
the sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; so do not
reveal that political and economic cotrol was generally complete several
generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a while until
civilization advances sufficiently for phase five.

	In fact you might still push Vennard's The Federal Reserve Hoax:
"Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined,
behind-the-scenes under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian
force--worshipers of Mamon--whose undying purpose is world control through the
control of Money. July 1, 1776 (correct that to May 1st, Vennard can't get
anything right) the Serpent raised its head in the under-ground secret society
known as the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt. There is considerable
documentary evidence to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions, strikes and
chaos stem from this source." Etc., etc., you know the stuff.

	The general location of our US HQ, incidently, has been nearly
exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century (what a
drag!). If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep in the labyrinth
of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is presided over by The Dealy
Lama. Inclosed are some plans for several new potential locations. Please
review and add any comments you feel pertinent, especially regarding the
Eristic propensity of the Pentagon site.

	Oh, and we have some good news for you, Brother Mal! You know that
Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us? Well, he has secretly co-ordinated
the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our theoriticians are in ecstacy
over the new information coming out. Look, if you people out there can keep
from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations, then we will finally
have it. After 20,000 years, Kull's dream will be realized! We can hardly
believe it. But the outcome is certain, given the time. Our grandchildren,
Mal! If civilization makes it through this crises, our grandchildren will live
in a world of authentic freedom and authentic harmony and authentic
satisfaction. I hope I'm alive to see it, Mal, success is in our grasp. Twenty
thousand years....!

	Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it. Good luck on the Principia.
Ewige Blumenkraft! HAIL ERIS.

					Love,
					     MAD MALIK

Part Five     The Golden Secret


NONSENSE AS SALVATION

The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases
taking itself so seriously.

To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION. Salvation
from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking order so
seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder, that GAMES
are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS THE ART OF
PLAYING GAMES.

To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and
play with The Goddess Erip. And know that it is a joyful play, and that
thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master
sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that
moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his
surroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He
becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free
to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without
fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his
soul and love in his being.

And when men become free then mankind will be free.
May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.
May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
May you have the knowledge of a sage,
    and the wisdom of a child.

THE LAST WORD
The foregoing document was revealed to Mal-2 by the Goddess Herself through
many consultations with Her within his Pineal Gland. It is guaranteed to be
the Word of Goddess. However, it is only fair to state that Goddess doesn't
always say the same thing to each listener, and that other Episkoposes are
sometimes told quite different things in their Revelations, which are also the
Word of Goddess. Consequently, if you prefer a Discordian Sect other than
POEE, then none of these Truths are binding, and it is a rotten shame that you
have read all the way down to the very last word.

			 INTERVIEW WITH NORTON CABAL
		   by Gypsie Skripto, Special Correspondent

	It has been ten years since I net the mysterious Malaclypse the
Younger. I was free lancing for the underground papers and went to POEE Hear
Temple at 555 Battery Street to try for an interview.

	I found him in the Temple PO Box busy wrapping up the new Fourth
Edition of PRINCIPIA. He seemed impatient with me, insisting that he didn't
have the time or inclination for foolish questions from reporters. Undaunted,
I burst out with questions like whether he prefered Panama Red or Acapulco
Gold and how the fuck did we manage to fit inside of a tiny post office box
and other things apropos a naive young semiliterate dropout hippy writer. He
asked me if I wanted to drop mescaline and fuck all night and said he knew how
to turn himself into a unicorn and there might be room for a tiny interview on
the cover of the PRINCIPIA if I wanted to work for the GREATER POOP so I said
sure, OK, I've never dropped mescaline in a post office box before.

	It turned out I was among the last to see Malaclypse. As subsequent
issues of GREATER POOP revealed, he was to disappear and POEE business was to
be assumed by his students at Norton Cabal. Professor Ignotum P. Ignotius,
Department of Comparative Realities, was assignedthe Trust of the POEE Scruple
and Rev. Dr. Occupant became Keeper of the Box. The newly published copies of
PRINCIPIA were distributed by Mad Malik, Block Disorganizer, who had
distribution contacts with the Aluminum Bavariati. Practical relations
remained in the hands of concept artist G. Hill.

	When the 1000 PRINCIPIAS were gone the GREATER POOP stopped
publishing, Head Temple closed down and the Cabal just seemed to evaporate.
Finally even the box was closed. But over the years I noticed that copies were
still circuating, and that independent Discordian Cabal would occasionally pop
out of nowhere (and still do ). And I would wonder what ever happened to
Malaclypse.

	When I read the ILLUMINATUS trilogy I resolved to again find and
interview the denizens of Joshua Norton Cabal of the Discordian Society.

				    * * *

	As I cabled over Nob to San Francisco's Station 'O' Post Office I
couldn't help but wonder at Goddess' hand in assigning street addresses to Her
outposts. Mal2 had told me that Good Lord Omar always filed everything under
"O" for OUT OF FILE.

	"Maya is marvelous" I was thinking when I rapped on the little metal
door and was greeted warmly by a huge beard who introduced himself as
Professor Ignotius. He ushered me into a spacious wood paneled and tapestry
hung parlor where three others were laughing and passing around a wine jug.
The sunny one in a tunic was the Reverend Doctor Occupant, the trim khaki and
jeans was Mad Malik and the wine jug claimed to be Hill. I got the recorder
on....

GYPSIE SKRIPTO [in response to a question]: ...1969 but only briefly. I guess
I missed you guys.

MAD MALIK: No wonder, he was pretty much a one man show then. We were just his
students and were usually off on errands. You worked for the POOP?

Gypsie: Well, for one night anyway. The interview is in the PRINCIPIA.

REV. DR. OCCUPANT: Malik wsa the only one he would ever let write for the POOP
or get on the letterhead.

Gypsie: Did you [Malik] have higher authority than the others?

Malik: No, [but I was allowed to speak in the POOP] because [Malaclypse the
Younger] hated politics. He was infuriated with Johnson and nixon over Viet
Nam because it was turning the renaissance into a political revolution and was
stealing his sacred thunder. So he trained me in Zenarchy, which he learned
from Omar, and I was the official anarcho-pacifist for the Cabal. Also I was
liason to The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, the Chicago Discordians.
Later Omar activated the Hung Mung Cong Tong and ELF, on zenarchist
principles, and also Operation Mindfock. I was also into those. Though at the
time I was masquerading in GREATER POOP as a created cabbage to throw off the
FBI.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Since you wrote it, I take it you are an anarchist?

G.H. Hill: Since then I have given up anarchy. Too many rules-- hating the
government and all that stuff.

IGNOTUM PER IGNOTIUS: It's like hating your own fantasies.

Malik: [Anarchy] is also standing up and proceeding forward, fantasy rule or
not. The condition is the same.

Occupant: Brother needs some wine!

Malik: We have had this arguement before, Reverend Doctor Brother. But wine
before platitudes, fill it up.

Gypsie [to Hill]: And pacifism?

Hill: I'm not sure I ever was one. Mal2 was not, Malik was. Personally I
accepted self defense yet I could never reconcile that with the ideal. I
finally gave up on that one too. Actually I just gave up on idealism.

Ignotius: Idealism lives with rules. Realism lives with rocks.

Hill: Yeah. I get along better with rocks.

Malik: Mal2 once told me that pacifism was a dilemma. If everybody was a
pacifist then everything would be perfect. But nobody is going to be a
pacifist unless I am first. But if I am and somebody else is not, then I get
screwed. He said that there were five choices under that circumstance. The
first was napalming farmers and the second was executing your parents. The
third was hypocrisy, the fourth was cowardice, and the fifth was to swallow
the dilemma. Zenarchists are trained in dilemma swallowing.

Occupant: So are other Erisians, like POEE.

Ignotius: That is characteristic of the Discordian perspective.

Hill: But of course training contradicts Discordian principles.

Malik: Oh so what. Contradictions are nothing to Discordians.

Occupant: Dilemma, Schilmemma. [to Gypsie]: What do you think of this, pretty
ma'am? We don't get to hear your thoughts.

Gypsie: I'm reporting now, you talk.

Occupant: Later then?

Gypsie: Perhaps. Later.

Occupant: You are smiling.

Gypsie: Hey, guy, later. [to Hill]: Doesn't this leave you a little schizy?

Hill: It's OK, I'm half Gemini.

Gypsie: What's the other half?

Hill: Taurus. That makes me a stubborn schizy.

Ignotius: I'm a Whale.

Occupant: I choose Satyr.

Malik: Spirits don't have signs.

Hill: A character can have a sign if I want it so.

Occupant: Well i can have a sign if I want to and screw both of you.

Malik: Come on Greg, you just think that we are your characters....

Occupant: You were inhabited by Malaclypse the Younger. He caused you to
create roles and those roles are being performed by us spirits.

Ignotius: A perfectly normal pagan relationship.

Hill: Well you can look at it like that if you want to, but I created Mal2 to
my specifications just as I conceived all the rest of you.

Occupant: You didn't invent Eris. She caused you to think you created the
spirit of Malaclypse.

Hill: Oh bull! Besides, I changed her so much the Greeks would never recognize
her.

Occupant: That's what She wanted!

Ignotius: Deities change things around all the time.

Malik: What you don't realize is that a spirit has a self identity.

Hill: Nope. A spirit is a product of definition and the one who is doing the
defining around here is me. Your identity is what I say it is. Just to prove
it, I'm going to change your name.

SINISTER DEXTER: It's OK with me. Fate is fate. I never much liked "Mad Malik"
anyway.

Ignotius: Besides people confused him with Joe Malik in ILLUMINATUS.

Dexter: I sort of onjoyed the confusion part.

Occupant: Doesn't prove anything anyway.

Gypsie: That name sounds familiar. Where is it from?

Hill: Its a name I came up with in the old days and never used it much. Its on
page 38 of the PRINCIPIA refering to Vice President Spiro Agnew. I always
thought I invented it but now it sounds like a Stan Freberg name now that I
think about it. It may have stuck in my preconscious memory from early TV.

Gypsie: Can you use it without his permission?

Hill: If it is his? I don't know. I hope so. it means "left right" in Latin
and is a perfect name for a libertarian anarchist. Actually in my kind of art
the question of what can I use freely and what can I not is a very tricky
problem.

Gypsie: How do you mean?

Hill: Well, take a collage for example. Like the early one on page 36 of the
PRINCIPIA. Each little piece was extracted from some larger work created by
some other artist and published and maybe copyrighted. I find them in
newspapers and magazines mostly. Often from ads. With a collage you select and
extract from your enviroment and then assemble into an original relationship.

The PRINCIPIA itself is a collage. A conceptual collage. All of it happens
simultaneously. But visually it is a montage, passing through time, like a
book does.

There is a lot of pirated stuff in the PRINCIPIA, especially in the margins.
But also I sympathize with artists who must own and sell their works to earn a
living. Art, like knowledge, should be free fodder for everyone. But it isn't
It is perplexing.

Gypsie: Where did all the things in PRINCIPIA come from?

Hill: Well, a full answer would take another book in itself. Most of the
writing credited to a name is a true person and almost always a different name
means a different person. Most of the non-credited, you know, Malaclypse, text
is mine although some things credited to either Mal2 or Omar were actually
co-written and passed back and forth and rewritten by each of us. The
marginalia, dingbats, and pasted in titles and heads and things came from
wherever I found them--some of which is original but uncredited Discordian
output, like the page head on 12 and other pages which is from a series of
satiric memo pads from Our Peoples Underworld Cabal. All page layout is mine
and some whole graphics like the Sacred Chao and the Hodge Podge Transformer
are mine but mostly I just found stuff and integrated it. Mostly I did
concept, say 50% of the writing, 10% of the graphics, all of the layout.

Gypsie: Specifically, what are some of the sources?

Hill: Weel, the poem on the front cover is by Walt Kelly and was spoken by one
of his characters in Pogo. The government seals starting from page 1 are from
a book of sample seals from the U.S. Government Printing Office. Western Union
on page 6 got into the act because I used to be a teletype operator and had
access to blank forms. Rubber stamps came from all over the place and some,
like the apple on page 27, I carved myself. A few I ordered to my
specification, like on page 1. The quote on the top of page 8 might be from
Barnum, I'm not sure. The jumping man on page 12 is from an advertisement. I
recognize the style--a popular commercial artist-- but I don't know his name.
The Chinese on the page is a grocery ad, I think. The Norton money on page 14
is historic,plus my little additions. The apple on page 17,as well as the
triangle on 23 and the Sacred Chao on 50 are, believe it or not, pasteups of
mimeographs, from Seattle Cabal. That group produced the best damn mimeography
I've ever seen. The Lick Here Box on page 23 is one of many tidbits making the
rounds in alternative/underground newspapers in those days. Trip 5 page header
on 29 was a chapter title in one of Tim Leary's books. The Knight on the bull
with the TV antenna on his helmet on page 46 came from a very artistic
magazine called Horseshit and put out by two brothers from Long Beach. I don't
remember their names. Wonderful magazine.

Occupant: Eris told Mal2 what to use and where to find it.

Hill: Yeah, in a way that is right. That is why my name does not appear
anywhere on the PRINCIPIA and why it was published with a broken
copyright--Reprint What You Like. I knew I was taking liberties and didn't
want my intentions to be misunderstood. It was an experiment and was intended
to be an underground work and that involves a different set of ethics than
commercial work.

Gypsie: There are no real names at all?

Hall: Oh, some. Camden Benares is a real name because he legally changed his
original name to his Holy Name. Also, instead of using Mordecai Malignatus I
used Bob Wilson's real name on page 12 because Werewolf Bridge was a work
before Discordianism. And of course real people like Neils Bohr crop up in
quotes. 

Gypsie: What do you think about the PRINCIPIA now? Would you want to change it?

Hill: I consider it a successful work and I wouldn't want to change it. In
some ways it is immature and I am not the same person I was 10 years ago, but
it accomplished the objectives I set for myself and it has the effect I wanted
it to have. There are a few errors though.

Gypsie: Like what?

Hill: Oh, I changed a quote from Tom Gnostic on page 61 and I don't think he
ever did forgive me for it. He's right. Starbuck's Pebbles should have been
preceded by the Myth of Starbuck which was being saved for something else and
never got used. I should have used it when I had the chance. And then Eris did
a neat little trick on me by having IBM make the Greek selectric typewriter
element not coincide with all the characters on their keyboard. So the little
"kallisti" that appears on the title page and lastly on the back cover came
out "kallixti" and I was too dumb to know the difference.

Gypsie: Will there ever be a Fifth Edition?

Hill: There already is a Fifth Edition, by Mal2. It is a one page telegram
that reduces everything to an infinite aum. I found it at Western Union where
a machine got stuck and kicked out hundreds of pages of nothing but m's. He
made it the Fifth Edition and then left.

Principia/Malaclypse was a very personal work for me and actually took 10
years to culminate. it was one single statement that included my adolescence
in the 50's and my young adulthood in the 60's. When I finally had the
paste-ups done I knew that I had finished it. That is why, quote, Malaclypse
left. I knew it was finished. I didn't know exactly what it was, but it was
done.

Occupant: See?

Gypsie: Earlier you said that you met your objectives. Just what were those
objectives?

Hill: Well, that's hard to answer because it kept refining itself over the
years. In 1969 I mainly though of myself as a cosmic clown and I set out to
prove, by demonstration, that a deity can be anything at all.

In other words, people invent gods and not the other way around. Later I
decided that I was doing some kind of conceptual art.

In the 50's my culture taught me that I was created by and for a deity, a
specific male deity, and that all other deities are FALSE. Yet my growing
experience showed me that any deity is true in some sense and false in some
other sense. So I set out to do what my society told me is impossible--make a
real religion from a patently absurd deity.

In the 50's a female deity was blasphemy. In the 70's a humorous deity is
still considered impossible, ridiculous, and blashpemous. As far as I'm
concerned, I have proven my point. Eris is a real deity and even though I
don't promote Erisianism as a serious religion....

Occupant: I do!

Dexter: You speak for yourself.

Ignotius: Here, here.

Hill: ...I do point out that it makes just as much sense from its own
perspective as all the others do from each of their own perspectives.

Occupant: I think paganism is a valid spiritual path. I encourage Erisianism
because it makes fun of itself. i think this is healthy.

Ignotius: If you can live rewardingly with Goddess Eris you can live with any
deity, including none at all.

Dexter: I don't much go for the worship business but I argee with Occupant
about the spirit of the thing. We live in a time of turmoil, the whole planet
is in a state of change. If we, as a species, cower from the confusion then we
die with the dying. This is revolution.

Ignotius: I am an athiest myself. There is no Greg Hill.

[laughter]

Gypsie [to Hill] : What do you think of ILLUMINATUS?

Hill: Oh, I love it. I wwas finishing PRINCIPIA when Shea and Wilson were
working on ILLUMINATUS. It took Dell five years to publish it...maybe that is
significant. The 1969 Discordian Society was a mail network between
independent writers of various kinds. Norton Cabal was just me and my
characters and I used the other Cabals as sort of a laboratory. In return
other Discordians would bounce their stuff off of me. We would toss in ideas
and anybody could take anything out. It was a concept stew. The exchanging of
ideas and techniques broadened and encouraged all of us.

I like ILLUMINATUS for the surrealism. A very effective method of writing.

Ignotius: I got misquoted. Worse, I wasn't even in that scene and if I had
been then I would have said something else.

Dexter [to Ignotius]: That was me in that scene.


Ignotius: Oh, is that what that was?

Dexter: He got our names mixed up.

Hill: He got mixed up about me too, in COSMIC TRIGGER. Bob says that when
Oswald was buying the assassination rifle, my girlfriend was printing the
first edition of PRINCIPIA on Jim Garrison's Xerox. It wasn't my girlfriend,
it was Kerry's; it wasn't the FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, it was some earlier
Discordian thought; it wasn't Garrison's Xerox, it was his mimeograph; and it
wasn't just before Kennedy was shot but a couple of years before that.*

The FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, by the way, was reproduced at Xerox Corp when
xerography was a new technoloGypsie. Which was my second New Orleans trip in 
1965. I worked for a guy on Bourbon Street who was a Xerox salesman by day.

Dexter: I think that George Dorn took too much guff from Hagbard. If someone
pulls a weapon on me, I'm more inclined to either leave or kill the
sonofabitch. 

Occupant: You are supposed to be a pacifist.

Dexter: I'm speaking figuratively of course. I'll tell you more tomorrow.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Did you really translate erotic Etruscan poetry?

Hill: Sure, but I used a pen name. I signed it "Robert Anton Wilson".

[A quick rap is heard on the door]

Gypsie: I have only one question left...

Dexter: I'll get it.

Gypsie: ...what I really want to know is how can we all fit inside of a tiny
little post office box?

Dexter[to Gypsie]:It's a telegram for you, from Mal2.

Gypsie: To me?

[Paper tearing]
 
Gypsie [reading]: "If I told everybody how they could live inside of a post
office box then everybody would stop paying landlords and go live inside their
post office boxes. It would collapse the building! Can you imagine, post
offices collapsing all over the country, the hemisphere, the PLANET! The whole
world's communication system would be destroyed. No,no, I must not say. I dare
not!

-------------
* I checked this further with Mr. Thornley. He says that the woman in question
was not his girlfriend, she was just a friend, and it wasn't a couple of years
before Kennedy was shot but had to be a couple of years after (but before
Garrison investigated Thornley). --GS
