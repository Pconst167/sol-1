                              The Will & the Word

  The Will & the Word is an ancient form of Psionics. It is treated as magic
  in it's highest form. Few are capable of using it & those who have it have
  to obey certain rules of the universe. These rules guide the adept through
  the rigors of it's use. To dedicate oneself to the Will & the Word is a
  very taxing & tiring life. The wielder of this can, by will alone cause
  effects in the world around them. Depending of the strength of the wielder's
  will, anything is possible. It is also possible for the wielder to over
  reach himself & depleat his very lifeforce. This, of course, is almost
  always fatal.

  The rule of the Will & the Word is simple but brutally enforced by the
  universe itself. It is as so follows:

  One may never Will something to be "Unmade". To do so will result in the
  utter destruction of oneself. The universe exists to create not destroy.
  "She" will not permit anything, even the smallest pebble to "unmade".

  Users of the Will & the Word have certain inate abilities they gain after
  choosing the way of the Will & the Word. These abilities are as follows:

    1. Telepathy. Limited to other users of the way & families. Range
       is not known (one example was contact well over 3000 miles!).
       (DM note: limit is 100 miles per level of experience.)
    2. Shape change. Limited to normal animals (no monster types).
       Usually a wielder chooses only one form to use through out
       his life. (DM note: 1 shape per 10 levels of experience.)
    3. Mind Scan. This ability must be consciously activated &
       directed. This ability can tell if a person is a wielder
       of the Will & the Word, if he/she is a mage (& what type,
       if a wild mage, specialist, or elementalist), what the general
       alignment of the person is (i. e. Good, Neutral, or Evil).
       This power can be detected when it is used. If the target of
       the Mind scan is a mage or cleric he has a 1©2 on a d8 to
       detect the attempt. If the target is a wielder of the Will &
       the Word he has a 1©3 on a d8. If the target is also scanning
       then the detection is automatic. If the detection attempt is
       found then then scan can be tracked back to the user (if the
       target is a wielder.). The chance to Mind scan someone is 25%
       + 8% per level with the maximum scan percent being 99% (there
       is always a 1% chance of failure.). Tracking a scan attempt is
       equal to the target's chance to scan minus the scanner's level
       times 5. There is no maximum range for this power (although
       it is vauge & untrustworthy past 100 miles per intelligence
       point of the caster.).
    4. Mental Shield. This ability can block a Mind scan, Detect
       Alignment, Detect Evil/Good, ESP, Telepathy, some psionic
       attack modes (B, C, & D) & may reduce damage done by others
       (A & E) by half. This is a power that must be concsiously
       activated & mantained (concetrated on. No spell casting,
       psionic actions, or use of other Will & the Word powers with
       one exception: shape change. If shape changed at the time of
       the scan (or other) attempt then the form remains solid. The
       power PHYSICALLY changes the user into the animal form except
       for his mind.). The chance of this working is 20% + 10% per
       level of the user.
    5. Shadow Sending. This is the power to "send" the user's shadow
       to a far distant place. His shadow becomes a illusionary
       double of the user that he may speak & hear through.To send
       his shadow the user must first locate the intended target (who
       will see & hear the shadow as if totally real, except it is
       intangiable.). using Mind scan or by tracking the target's
       scanning attempt (this may not be necessary if the target is
       known to be located at a specific spot (i. .e a king in his
       Throne room, a prisoner in a specific cell, etc...) or is
       a family member.). The sender must concentrate to do this &
       can only maintain the Sending as long as he does so. There
       is no maximium range for this ability (although the shadow
       sent looses some realism if sent over 100 miles per level of
       the sender in distance.). The wielder may be able to use his
       powers while in his shadow. There is a 20% chance that the
       user will be able to do so. (DM note: This is rolled & noted
       at the creation of the character.).
    6. Detect lie. This ability allows a wielder to detect if someone
       he is speaking with is lying or not. It must be consciously
       used (DM note: the player must inform the DM thaat he is
       attempting to do this.). The chance is 10% + 5% per level to
       a maximum of of 80%. There are modifiers due to intelligence
       as seen on table 3.
    7. Joining. This is the most powerful ability that wielders of
       the Will & the Word have. If two or more wielders wish the can
       link the minds & wills together to increase their power. This
       allows them to achieve much more powerful Mind scans, Mental
       shields, or Detect lies. This also allows the joined wielders
       to combine their mental power (PSP points) for use of etiher
       of the two's mental powers (i. e. if while joined the wielders
       wish to attack a target the do so at their levels added
       together! Say if one was 5th lv. & one 8th lv. then joined
       they would attack as a 13th lv. person!). Only one wielder may
       act per round however no matter how many attacks they had
       seperatly. Also this is a strenuous thing & is very tiring
       on the users. (DM note: the longest the two may be joined
       is the lower constitution score of the two in rounds. Also
       the wielders can not do anything other then rest or walk
       slowly for the number of rounds joined in d4 rolls (i.e. if
       joined 3 rounds then roll 3d4 to see how long the two are
       disabled.). Both wielders must be willing to perform the
       joining to achieve it.
    8. Aura Manipulation. This ability allows the wielder to alter
       his aura. This alteration may take on one of these forms :
       (there are modifiers to the saves for the below listed on
       table 4. The duration of the effects are on table 5.)
         Fear: anyone within 20'r of the user must save vs Fear or
         cower from the user. Even if the save is succesful the
         person still feels on edge & a bit aprehensive about the
         user.
         Leadership/Authority: anyone within 20'r of the user must
         save vs spells or obey the users commands. If the save
         is made then the target will either ignore or refuse the
         user's commands.
         Friendship: anyone within 10'r of the user must save vs
         spells or immediatly become friends with the user. This
         friendliness expresses itself as good natured greetings,
         freindly chatter, freindly help, etc. This also increases
         the user's Charisma by 5 points while in affect.
         Love: When used on a female within 25'r of the user must
         save vs spells or become attracted to the user. They will
         do anything the user requests as long as that request isn't
         suicidal or obviously dangerous.
         Trust: When used, the target person(s) must save vs Breath
         Weapon or immediatly trust whatever the user tells him.
         Inconspicuous: anyone looking at the user must save vs spells
         or simply ignore him as a common, everyday person or 
         someone not worthy of notice.
         Domination: when using this, the user seems to have a strong
         personality & his presence is felt by all within 40'r. If the
         user wishes, he may attempt to intimidate a person(s) within
         this radius. If this is attempted the target must save vs
         Breath Weapon or become submissive & slightly obediant.

  The most powerful effect of becoming a wielder of the Will & the Word is
  that it alters the physical makeup of the body so as to confer a form of
  Immortality to the user. The wielder will still age but will appear only
  as old as he wishes but once the age is reached the person may not look
  younger then that (most women who are wielders tend to stop aging in
  appearence about 25 or so, men vary according to personality & prefernce).
  Also, as the person ages his intelligence increases slightly & the effects
  of age do little to his physical or mental abiliies (ignore aging
  adjustments to Ability scores after the Mature stage).

  Only humanoids may become wielders of the Will & the Word. The word
  "Humanoid" meaning Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, any
  goblinoid race, giants, or other bipedal, sentient race. Wielder's can
  not be of a Chaotic alignment. There is no level limitation for any race
  who wishes to imbark on this road of life.

  (DM Info: Wisdom of 14 or higher, Consitiution of 15 or higher, dexterity
  of 14 or higher. High intelligence is also good. If Wisdom, Constitution,
  & Dexerity are higher then 16 then the character may be dual class if the
  prime ability(ies) is met.)

  The Immortality that is granted to this character class shouldn't interfere
  with play at all. Remember it isn't real immortality. They can still die by
  blade, poison, falling, magical assault, psionic assault, etc... The
  character simply doesn't age anymore. This shouldn't hamper game play
  anymore then a long lived elf or dwarf character. If the player gets cocky
  over being immortal, take him down a peg or two by a brush with death. A
  couple close calls should put him back in place.

  Use the following to determine the PSP (Psionic Strength Points) of the

  Psionic energy comes from within the character.  The energy is measured in
  PSPs. When a character uses a Psionic power he exspends PSPs. The exact cost
  depends on which power is used and how long he uses it.

  The total number of PSP that a character has depends of four factors: his
  Wisdom, Intelligence, Constitution & experience level. Wisdom, Intelligence,
  & Constitution determine the inherent potential. (Wisdom is the primary
  factor.) Experience determines how well a character has developed that
  potential.

  Follow these steps to calculate a character's total PSPs:
    1.) Find the character's Wisdom score on table 6 & get the PSP
        base score from it.
    2.) Add the appropriate ability odifiers for the character's
        Intellegence & Constitution to his base score. This final
        adjusted number is the character's inherent potential.

  Score          Score         Modifier
  ========================================
  14              20             0
  15              24             0
  16              26             +1
  17              28             +2
  18              30             +3
  19              32             +4
  20              34             +5

  Gaining PSPs:
  Everytime a character advances a level, he expands his total pool of PSPs.
  To determine how many PSPs he gains, find the Ability modifer that
  coresponds to his Wisdom score. Add that number to 18. THe result is the
  total PSPs gain.

  Recovering PSPs:Ä
  A character who has expended PSPs can recover those points by "Taking it
  easy"- which means engaging in no hard physical activity & refraining from
  using psionic powers (i.e. refraining from expending any more PSPs). After
  each TurnÄin which a character expends no PSPs check table 7 to see how many
  PSPs he recovers. A character may never recover more PSPs than he lost.
  A character's rate of recovery depends on how much physical exertion he
  experienced during the turn in question. Wielders recover the most points
  when they sleep of meditate for the entire turn of rest. Light activity,
  such as walking or riding, diminishes the speed of recovery. Rate each turn
  by the most strenuous physical activity undertaken, even if only for a few
  minutes.

         ---->(here is the info for the Rejuvenation proficiency)<----
                             Rejuvenation (Wis -1)

  This proficiency allows a character to recover his PSPs while he meditates,
  as quickly as if he were sleeping. The character achieves a state of deep
  concentration, in which he focuses & regains his energies. He is still aware
  of his surrounding, so does not suffer any penalties to his sruprise or
  initiative rolls. (He can not expend PSPs while Rejuvenating though.)

                                   End Notes:

  I personally suggest perchasing the Complete Psionics Handbook for AD&D if
  you do not already own it. It will increase your campaign greatly. If you
  are running a 1st Edition game, this character class will still work. Simply
  convert the CPH to 1st edition rules & go from there.
