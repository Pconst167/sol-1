                   Transcript File : The Grove of Avalon
                   -------------------------------------
   The Grove is one of a pair of unique Chat-rooms run for a while on the PC-Link system by some pagan interest/philosophy interested people to expand the general consiousness of pagans and non-pagans. The room is free-form, with users using handle names to retain animinity. The following is a transcript of a single evening recorded by 'Ravensong' the room host for the evening.



Unnefer   : transcend the false mind-unite with the absolute-become god

Ravensong : Ah, then you hold the principle that together we are the sum of 
            God/Goddess?

Unnefer   : yes

Unnefer   : god/goddes/not god/goddess all at the same time

Ravensong : INteresting, we are both one and not one?

GaryG59   : what's on the fire?

Unnefer   : yes and not one or not not one

Ravensong : ...We are discusing our divinity, or lack of understanding of 
            it....

Unnefer   : this limited language is of no use to describe it

Unnefer   : humanity as it is, is lost

Ravensong : But the principles you are presenting do project beyond the words 
            we use

GaryG59   : from the papers i dont think we have any divinity.

Ravensong : Lost?

Unnefer   : follow your true will-become a god

Ravensong : But if I was God/Goddess I'd get bored in the long run...thats 
            why this game called life!

Ravensong : Gary, you don't see the forest becuiase of the Billboard....

Unnefer   : the "game" is to become god/goddess by realising it!

GaryG59   : define true will.

Ravensong : But is winning the game all its cracked up to be?

Unnefer   : the absolute action you must take=will

Unnefer   : destiny???

Ravensong : True Will? We all have the will to choose whgat we do....

Unnefer   : yes, but there is only one action that maintains the balace of 
            power

Ravensong : ...wether we decided to do it in this lifetime or the one before

GaryG59   : how can you become a God/

Unnefer   : by realising your true will

Ravensong : HOw do you know you're not already one Gary?

Unnefer   : no one can know

Unnefer   : there is no knowing

Ravensong : But if True will is all that is in question, what if my will is 
            to play at life?

Unnefer   : only doing-or a state of becoming

GaryG59   : the christian God hates competition.

Ravensong : Perspective : Use it or lose it.

Unnefer   : then do it ravensong!

Unnefer   : the christian god is blood thirsty and evil

Ravensong : Hello Cleo, welcome to Metaphysics 101....where we ask are you a 
            God(dess)?

Unnefer   : lol

Ravensong : The Christian god is not what Christians portray him to be...

CLEO71    : TOO DEEP FOR ME

Ravensong : ...they refuse to read their own holy writs with any depoth...

GaryG59   : the old testament or the new??

Unnefer   : it/he has been distorted from the tru teachings

Ravensong : The new Testament says that the Christian god is a god of Love, 
            yes?

Unnefer   : jesus christ was a buddha-no doubt

GaryG59   : yes

Ravensong : Hello Chris...welcome to the Grove, where Eris laughs at us 
            all...

Unnefer   : christian god = evil-programming of ideology into the youth

Ravensong : And Jesus was also a person who wanted to develop true 
            Communisim....

Unnefer   : utopian communism

Ravensong : ..not the false version that Russia or China developed....

Ravensong : exactly

Ravensong : Gary, what do you believe in?

Unnefer   : russia/china=distorted(BY FAR) OF MARX

Unnefer   : who is ERIS? that discordian?? deity?

Ravensong : ...Even Marx didn't have it quite right....

Unnefer   : yes he was off a bit

GaryG59   : if i were a god i think that i would know it

Ravensong : Hello Dick & Dan...welcome to the grove have a seat by our 
            fire....

Unnefer   : cant be explained in words

Unnefer   : you woulndt even conceive of a you

Ravensong : Why would you need to label yourself?

Unnefer   : only unity?or lack of it-parodox!

Unnefer   : there is no you to label!

GaryG59   : what of objective reality?

Ravensong : Reality is a playground!

Ravensong : ...and we are all children upon it!

Unnefer   : there isnt any, only a participator/creator of reality

Unnefer   : raven- who is Eris?

Unnefer   : wiccan deity?

GaryG59   : we create our own reality????

Unnefer   : yes!!!!!!!!!

Ravensong : Eris is the ancient greek Goddess/Personification of Chaos and 
            Strife....

Unnefer   : by acting acording to your true will, then you would be a god!

Ravensong : Actually, I believe we each are a seperate individual reality...

Ravensong : that interaccts with other realities...

Unnefer   : causing change to occur in conformity to WIL!!!!

Unnefer   : will atgh!

Ravensong : GGreetings Hotelcal...welcome to the Grove where you can stiull

Unnefer   : satan=the false mind/ego

Unnefer   : raven you must live on the east coast then?

Unnefer   : a symbol

Unnefer   : 73 here yester...

Ravensong : Greetings Kitaiyla...

KITAIYLA  : good eve

Unnefer   : gary?

GaryG59   : what?

KITAIYLA  : Ravensong....are you talking about the WLPA?

Unnefer   : well raven do you understand my "reality trip" now???:)

Ravensong : Satan is a creation of a church that needed an advesary figure to 
            keep its populance

Ravensong : under control,

Unnefer   : yes!!!but more a symbol of the false mind/ego

Ravensong : WLPA?

Ravensong : Yes, I understand what you're saying, Unnefer...you present a 
            diffrent variation

KITAIYLA  : Satan is a perversion of the Horned One, not a creation of the 
            church

GaryG59   : no horns or pointy tail?

Ravensong : on what Richard Bach did, a little less optimistic.

Unnefer   : the ancient one

Unnefer   : christ-drug yum yum

Ravensong : The Horned god is an Archetype, a creation of our group mind that 
            is mankind'

Unnefer   : i'm from the non-reality-unity-absolute school

GaryG59   : WICCA?

Ravensong : Jung said there were many ARchetype, each with a purpose in our 
            created realities

Unnefer   : jung was right on track

Ravensong : WIcca is one set of beliefs, forged to achieve a set of goals by 
            a group of

Unnefer   : commentary on the Tibetan book of the Dead was great!-Jung

Ravensong : individual 'universes'

Unnefer   : wicca is not mu cup of tea. although it is interesting

Ravensong : Jungs only flaw was his own prejudices...they caused his 
            failure...

GaryG59   : JUNG was a little strange

Ravensong : The Wiccan philosophy is a good solid means to lkearn and build 
            ones own knowledge

Ravensong : of ones self-universe.

Unnefer   : yes i agree- and freud also(prejudices)

Ravensong : Wicca is not the only path, it is one of many.

Ravensong : Freud, like Newton, was flawed by his means of observation.

KITAIYLA  : Snowy owl says to inform the group that he will be in the room 
            shortly...

Unnefer   : my path is ALL paths-they all go to the same place

GaryG59   : rs what path is your?

Ravensong : Snowy is always welcome

Ravensong : Thanks Kitayiyla...I've been fine, but strapped money wiuse

Ravensong : My path is not Wiccan, though I spent time there as my 
            foundation, it is mearly mine

ScottD32  : Avalon N.J.

Ravensong : Wicca helps one to begin to open ones mind to the possibilities 
            of ones universe

Unnefer   : there is only one path(realy)

Ravensong : Greetings scott welcome unto the Grove...

Unnefer   : many universes-or non-universes

Ravensong : There are many paths that lead to the same road

Unnefer   : yes that is what i was saying

Ravensong : ...we all seek the road.

Crag Hack : Goodevening, Ravensong!

GaryG59   : no fear of HELL?

Ravensong : Hello Crag, welcome

ScottD32  : Jesis the only way!!

Unnefer   : the road is a difficult one

KITAIYLA  : there is no hell

Ravensong : Greetings all!

ScottD32  : sorry Jesus

Unnefer   : christ-drug - progarmming and ideology

Ravensong : Scott, if you mean Jesus, perhaps for you his teachings are the 
            only path.

BoingoVH2 : fare well all. just stopping by again.

ScottD32  : Jesus has defeated satin

Ravensong : Some of us must create our own path, others can follow those 
            already forged

Unnefer   : yes rs there is only each persons will

Ravensong : Scott..I'm not impressed, defeqating cloth is easy!

Ravensong : (joke)

Snowy Owl1: <hoot>

Unnefer   : satan is a symbol for much more than you may or may not know

KITAIYLA  : GREETINGS, SNOW!!!!!!!!

BoingoVH2 : hi owl!

Snowy Owl1: gee, HI EVERYBODY!

BoingoVH2 : i'm just leaving.

Snowy Owl1: [i like feeling popular  :D  ]

Crag Hack : Satan is a satan is a symbol amoung many symbols that are 
            supposed to mean evil

Ravensong : By BOING!

Snowy Owl1: not cause i got here, i hope.

Ravensong : What is evil?

ScottD32  : I'm talking real Christ, what do you have

Crag Hack : Although, I don't believe in evil

Unnefer   : evil is relative to ones will

GaryG59   : fried snowy owl YUM!

Snowy Owl1: "Satan is a satan is a..."   there's a song in that 
            Somewhere.....

Snowy Owl1: yum?

BoingoVH2 : no, i just won an hour in the auditorium so i'm leaving.

Unnefer   : evil=

KITAIYLA  : ?

Ravensong : Scott, Jesus was a good teacher for his culture...its just that 
            culture is no longer

Unnefer   : argh!

Ravensong : predominant

Snowy Owl1: "real Christ"  ??   is there a fake one?

BoingoVH2 : door prize!

Ravensong : Hello HHS!

Unnefer   : christ-drug

Snowy Owl1: Hah!!!!  Look again, Raven.

Crag Hack : I don't believe in an evil being or a good being.  I thinks good 
            and evil are the same thing

HHS151    : HELLO

Unnefer   : all is one one is all

Ravensong : HHS...loweR THY caps!

Crag Hack : Balance is the key

ScottD32  : satan is the deciever

Unnefer   : the TAO

Snowy Owl1: Oh, for certain there is "good" and "evil"  and we all know what 
            it is, in ourselves.

Unnefer   : satan= the false mind/ego

KITAIYLA  : :)

Ravensong : :)

Crag Hack : Satan dosen't exist, excpet when created to control the masses by 
            fear

BoingoVH2 : sounds more like the "golden mean"

Unnefer   : it is relative

Snowy Owl1: "Satan" is the...well..."prosecuting attorney" of the Hebrew 
            belief.

Ravensong : Scott...how much have you read of Religions?

Snowy Owl1: makes sure no one makes it into Heaven that doesnt deserve it.

Unnefer   : there are many satans in hebrew myth

ScottD32  : Jesus LOVES you ALL!!

BoingoVH2 : bye.

Crag Hack : It's the old party line.  "If you don't go to church every 
            sunday, then your going to hell"

Snowy Owl1: [have you considered my servant Job??]

Unnefer   : heaven is in the true mind

Snowy Owl1: good to hear, scott, could use all the help i can get

Crag Hack : Or maybe, "If you don't comb hair right, your going to hell"

Unnefer   : church=programming and lies

Snowy Owl1: i see, unn, that must be why i dont have it....

ScottD32  : I don't need to look any further

Ravensong : Don't we all want to be loved, Scott?

Unnefer   : you are in hell

Snowy Owl1: <--- Lacking "True Mind"   <hoot>

Ravensong : Scott, have you really ever even read your Bible?

Crag Hack : But the same also works in resverse.  "If you don't worship 
            satan, I shall destroy you"

ScottD32  : I have found the cure for evil

ScottD32  : Daily

Snowy Owl1: [Raven, displaying "knowledge snobbery"  strikes again....]

GaryG59   : what?

Crag Hack : I think both sides of the house, (Christ & Satan) are for the 
            birds.

Snowy Owl1: but what if one is not concerned by evil?

Unnefer   : evil is good good is goood evil is evil

Crag Hack : They were created to confuse and to control!

Unnefer   : yes!

Ravensong : Gretings, GreyLady stepping in for a few...

Ravensong : Hello Snowy love....

Snowy Owl1: Unnefer, do you work for the government, by any chance?

ScottD32  : What do you know about it raven

Unnefer   : i work for reality

Crag Hack : Hitle did the same thing, he just called it Nazi.  Stalin also 
            did it, So did we

Crag Hack : Except we call it law

KITAIYLA  : greetings, Greylady....

Unnefer   : never get to the point-but got alot to say!

Ravensong : Unnefer, are you speaking on a Junian basis or are you a 
            proponent of Sirley McClaine?

KITAIYLA  : :)

Crag Hack : God should be like the air, natural.  You should have work toward 
            God

Unnefer   : forget new age that is dead

ScottD32  : Those without the spirit

Snowy Owl1: that's "Jungian" 

GaryG59   : shirley'got nice leggs

Snowy Owl1: how about the Goddess, Crag?

Crag Hack : I mean you shouldn't have to work toward God!  (Pardon me)  :)

Ravensong : thank Snowy, I'm dyslexic you know

ScottD32  : do not know the things of God

Unnefer   : i speak as i will

Crag Hack : God/Goddess, it's the same thing.  Male.female gender is a human 
            thing.

Ravensong : I can't spell

Snowy Owl1: feel free.

Unnefer   : god cannot be defined

Crag Hack : It's better for us to understand if we refer to God as God or 
            Goddess

ScottD32  : Creator

Snowy Owl1: yes, but duality is universal, so some basis for male/female must 
            exist...

Unnefer   : intellect is the destructor

Ravensong : Crag, why?

Unnefer   : unity is universe

Crag Hack : God, is you.  And that plant, and this computer, and so , on, on

Unnefer   : and non-unity is universe

GaryG59   : manitou?

Snowy Owl1: so is Goddess, Crag..   :)

Crag Hack : We also think that we are everything!  That Earth is the center!  
            We have surprise coming soon!

Unnefer   : god is the all and the nothing

Ravensong : Unnefer, that's a similar clncept to the school of Greek thought 
            that stated all is one

ScottD32  : For God so loved the world, that he sent his only son

Ravensong : nothing is seperate

Crag Hack : Snowy, If you pefer Goddess, I use the word Goddess

Snowy Owl1: Ahhh, having trouble with Secular Humanism lately, Crag?

Crag Hack : How can God have a son, if he's not human

Unnefer   : I like the eastern philosophies better!

Crag Hack : lol, snowy

Snowy Owl1: :)

KlemClone : simple, he used the yellow pages

ScottD32  : not to condemn the world, but to save it through him

Snowy Owl1: i know quite a bit about them, Unnefer, please go ahead.

GaryG59   : turn to hymm 312 please

Unnefer   : my snowy arent you opinionated! :)

Ravensong : but Unnefer, you are supporting the Greek philosphies with your 
            words...not the eastern

Crag Hack : Scott, you and the rock have the same heart beat, but is yours as 
            peaceful as the rock's?

Unnefer   : unity is the absolute-i am a buddhist

Snowy Owl1: opinionated?  of course!  there is no such thing as a "pure fact" 
            so why bother?

ScottD32  : Yes

Snowy Owl1: Raven, please dont be so Intellectually Snobbish....it isnt 
            becoming.

Ravensong : but you sound greek

Unnefer   : yes snowy i agree, not take it so seriously! :)

GaryG59   : shave your head?

Ravensong : I'm not Raven...

Snowy Owl1: Telling someone they are wrong is not establish rapport, it is 
            useless argument.

Crag Hack : Folks, before we go on, lets announce ourselfs.  If we call 
            oursefls something, what is it?

Ravensong : remember?

ScottD32  : The peace that passes all understanding

Unnefer   : no i dont shave my head!

Snowy Owl1: [yes, i know....]

GaryG59   : saffron robes?

Snowy Owl1: I've always thought it must be terribly frustrating to be Right, 
            Scott.  Is it?

Ravensong : Snowy, just trying to identify the style of thought, not correct 
            someone - sorry if I came off

Ravensong : wrong!

Unnefer   : no! i am not a monk!

Crag Hack : Scott, how do you know your right?

ScottD32  : Jesus is right

Unnefer   : jesus is dead!

Crag Hack : How do you know Jesus is right?

GaryG59   : sufi?

ScottD32  : Jesus is alive

Crag Hack : Unnefer, don't insult him.  He has a right

Snowy Owl1: Then it must be terribly frustrating for you that not everyone 
            will simply recognize that fact.

Unnefer   : that is an islamic sect gary!

Ravensong : If you beleive he lives in your heart, Scott, then he does...

ScottD32  : He gave me his spirit

Unnefer   : right is relative to the individuals will

Crag Hack : So true Ravensong.  

Snowy Owl1: I feel sorry for you.  It is so hard to maintain a conversation 
            with us "wrong" people.

Ravensong : Each person's belief is what they wish it to be, each person's 
            universe is what they make it

Snowy Owl1: yes, and...

GaryG59   : whirling dervish?

Crag Hack : Scott, I happy for you.  I believe differently.  But I think 
            we'll go to the same place

ScottD32  : Whom do you believe Raven??

KlemClone : "When the truth of your life is too terrible, you revert to a 
            religion based on simple lies." 

Crag Hack : Which religion are you talking about KlemClone?

ScottD32  : Only one way

Ravensong : Scott, I am Raven's roommate, and I believe what my heart tells 
            me to be true...

Snowy Owl1: "Dimsie doats and dosie doats, and little lambsy divy"

ScottD32  : JESUS!!

Ravensong : in whatever language it needs to express itself

KITAIYLA  : lol

Crag Hack : Scott, what happens if your wrong?

KITAIYLA  : ?

Ravensong : Scott, the basis for peace is understanding - this is hare to 
            attain with a closed mind

Snowy Owl1: Scott, calm down....you must accept that you can never "convert" 
            here, only discuss.

ScottD32  : Not a chance

Ravensong : allow other's their own opinions and their own beliefs

Snowy Owl1: whoops!  time for party hats!

KITAIYLA  : many others have been wrong..........

Snowy Owl1: *****<B)

KITAIYLA  : ?

Unnefer   : what a fool i am!

GaryG59   : jimmy swaggert, right?

ScottD32  : Dont lead them to hell

Snowy Owl1: why?

Crag Hack : Are you sure?  For your sake, I hope your not wrong

Ravensong : perhaps, Scott, we are all wrong, and the truth is unknown to any 
            of us as yet..

ScottD32  : Swaggert is human

Ravensong : can you consider that?

Snowy Owl1: [Mumbo Jumbo, Lord of the Congo, may gnaw on our bones yet....]

Crag Hack : lol, snowy

KITAIYLA  : :)

Ravensong : LOL

ScottD32  : Try Jesus, You'll see

Ravensong : I have Scott...

KITAIYLA  : jesus is a myth

Ravensong : You tell me nothing I haven't known

Snowy Owl1: I already DO pray to Jesus, Scott.  And know my Bible very well.

Crag Hack : Jesus works in many ways, Scott.  Remember that.  How he works 
            with you may not be how

Crag Hack : he works with me

Ravensong : What is strength to you Scott, may not be to others

GaryG59   : jesus was a jew.

ScottD32  : Do you believe in him??

Crag Hack : I am Jew, by birth!  So, what?

KITAIYLA  : jesus was NOT a jew

ScottD32  : yes he was

GaryG59   : no?

KITAIYLA  : no

Unnefer   : if he was a myth cant he be anything?

H and H3  : yes

Crag Hack : I believe Jesus was a great man.  He had vision.  But he was a 
            danger to the government

Snowy Owl1: [here we go again...]   what do you mean by "believe"  ??

Crag Hack : so they destroyed him

GaryG59   : what was he then?

KITAIYLA  : lol      I guess

Snowy Owl1: For your information, Jesus WAS a Jew  (traced family line to 
            David, remember)

Ravensong : Can't we chjoose our own way?

Greylord  : Scott is talking Jesus...

Unnefer   : i agree balance is the key!

KlemClone : Scott is right, belief is the heart of it. If you believe you're 
            bad, you may well burn in hell

Ravensong : Jesus only showed one path of many to the road

ScottD32  : The wages of sin is death

Ravensong : Scott, you're not responding to the conversation...thats the 
            whole idea of dialog...

Crag Hack : Ravensong, I don't I ever sinned.  However, I bet Scott (if he 
            knew what I've done) would think 

Crag Hack : I have

ScottD32  : What is so bad Hack

Crag Hack : I think we'll down here to learn.  Whatever we do, we learn.  
            Even if it mean murder

Ravensong : Hello Victor, we're trying to discuss the universe as we know 
            it....

Unnefer   : Scott your jesus is not my jesus, cuz my jesus is me!

Greylord  : Maybe some day He will....

Ravensong : can you build us an example of reality to show off?

KlemClone : beats the hell outta me (which is GOOD from a Christian 
            perspective)

Crag Hack : The murderer is learning and so is the murdered person

ScottD32  : You can't save yourself

Unnefer   : good is relative to the individual, not the collective as in 
            christianity

VictorA6  : oh! well quarrel no further because I am..

Ravensong : ...can you save us Scott?

Greylord  : Did anyone here say they could?

Crag Hack : Why not?  Doesn't Jesus work through you?

ScottD32  : Jesus is reality!

Greysoul  : you are who ?

Ravensong : ...if you're selling salvation, we're not buying today thank 
            you....

ScottD32  : Jesus Saves

Ravensong : Scott, why would your benificent god create a race of sheep when 
            he already made sheep?

ScottD32  : Sorry vic

ScottD32  : Listen Raven with your heart

Unnefer   : scott who created your god...maybe MAN!

Ravensong : Scott...I have always followed my heart

ScottD32  : Hi Des P.T.L.

Des2      : There can be no design without a Designer

Greysoul  : scott...i went to 12 years of catholic school and god never said 
            anything new in the 12 years

Unnefer   : IHVH

Des2      : King of Kings...Lord of Lords....Yehweh...Jehovah God

Des2      : Hi Victor

Des2      : Not the last time I checked, Raven

Ravensong : Then why are you refering to the God of the Jews?

VictorA6  : i'm Christian

Des2      : I am uncircumcised, however....:0

Unnefer   : christ is the devil today

KlemClone : I appreciate the thought ( if not the charm... where did that 
            stigmata come from?)

VictorA6  : how so, unnefer?

Des2      : The Jews ....Israel.....was a type of the Church, Raven

Ravensong : Paramedic...I fear you've walked into one of our Us vs them 
            religion things again....

Unnefer   : because i will it to be!

Des2      : The devil DOES parade around as an angel of light Unnefer

Des2      : guess he fooled you

Ravensong : Des, if you believe what you say then why are you worshippping 
            someone else's god?

VictorA6  : and who empowers you to stand on the altar

Unnefer   : yes his name is jesus-and you've been deceived!

ScottD32  : Right on

KlemClone : "I'd give up my halo for a horn, and the horn for a hat I once 
            had.."

Unnefer   : just kidding

Des2      : God belongs to all who will receive Him

Greysoul  : the devil is in all of us but most of us choose not to listen to 
            him

Unnefer   : or not...

ScottD32  : Wrong uni

Unnefer   : !?

Paramedic6: That's fine, I always enjoy watching people who don't have any 
            idea what their talking about de'

Unnefer   : the devil is a symbol for the false mind/ego

Ravensong : Okay Paramedic, I just wanted to say I was sorry for the 
            atmosphere...

Des2      : You have a right to be wrong Paramedic

Paramedic6: debate each other's ignorance. It makes me giggle>

JRM0646   : Des2 is exactly right Unnefer, the devil comes to steal, kill, 
            and destroy...but Jesus came to 

Ravensong : here, have some ale...    [(_)

Des2      : Amen to that JRM

Greysoul  : any one have a fresh pot ofd coffee ?

Unnefer   : jesus is for those who fear death

ScottD32  : P.T.L.JRMO

KlemClone : guess you'll just have to watch Nightline tomorrow night to get 
            the details

Ravensong : Devil? Describe this entity you want to talk about....

Des2      : Will the created say to the Creator, why have you made me thus?

Paramedic6: Well, the solution didn't last, try again.

VictorA6  : someone want a bite of my pizza.

Des2      : No way Unnefer....Jesus is for those who want abundant life!

Unnefer   : just a symbol-like jesus/osiris/buddha,atc...

Greysoul  : i need coffee !

VictorA6  : what religion do you follow raven

ScottD32  : Jesus is the way 

Des2      : The devil goes about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may 
            devour

Greysoul  : for you scott

VictorA6  : well take some ...shees!!!

Unnefer   : man is god !!!!!!

JRM0646   : What kind of background did Unnefer come from?

ScottD32  : you too

Des2      : for ALL who will believe

Ravensong : I, Victor, am a Pagan upon a self appointed path, I make my way 
            without crutches

VictorA6  : will you please cut that out unnefer

Des2      : If you died, cursing God....

Unnefer   : one where i wasnt programmed!!!!!!!!!!

Des2      : the last thing you would see, as you slipped into eternity

Paramedic6: I am a non-denominational monotheist

Greysoul  : how can you say what is right for me ....scott

KlemClone : i'm on the edge of my seat Des2

Unnefer   : vic sorry ok

Des2      : would be a loving God with His arms outstretched...

Des2      : saying I love you, I love you...

Ravensong : Des, we don't curse gods...it would be a truly futile thing to 
            do....

ScottD32  : Listen to Jesus

ScottD32  : Grey

Ravensong : For if a god is omnipotent then you can't hurt him with a 
            curse....

Des2      : You c urse him by ignoring Him, Raven

Paramedic6: I believe there probably is one God, but I don't try to tell It 
            what church it should go to. 

Ravensong : ...anmd if he isn't there's no reason to curse him, hes already a 
            failure....

Greysoul  : what is he saying ?  i can not hear anything

Des2      : Right, Raven....you can't hurt him, but the curser hurts 
            himself...

KlemClone : you didn't c urse him!

ScottD32  : Recieve Him

Ravensong : If to ignore someone is to curse them then I've cursed billions!

Unnefer   : deceive him

Ravensong : ...and so have you!

Des2      : There can be no plan without a Planner...

Greysoul  : like i said i went to 12 years of jesus talk ... s o s nothing 
            different

Des2      : I meant deny, not ignore

KlemClone : read James Glick's book on Chaos

Ravensong : Des...there is no plan save that which we make....

Des2      : Obviously you werent listening, Grey

JRM0646   : Grey what "jesus" talk did you goto?

Des2      : Who gave you the brain to make the plan Raven?

Unnefer   : Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law

VictorA6  : O my God, you brighten the darkness around me..

Unnefer   : Love is the law, love under will

Greysoul  : catholic schooling...jrm

ScottD32  : Jesus is the light

VictorA6  : follow it

Des2      : We're not preaching religion, we're telling you about a way of 
            life!

Ravensong : I have my own way of life thank you....

VictorA6  : if you want to anyway..

Des2      : Please know...not trying to force down your throats

Ravensong : Want to here about mine?

Des2      : Just discussing, I thought

Des2      : Be my guest, Raven

Greysoul  : i was listening but .... nothing was different ...just do good 
            and you will live for ever

VictorA6  : not that i am trying to impose this on anyone just making 
            conversation

Greysoul  : that is basically universal

Des2      : not true Grey

JRM0646   : Greysoul you need to visit a 'spirit-filled' church...then I 
            guarntee you will change your mind 

JRM0646   : ...about Jesus

ScottD32  : Not by works

Unnefer   : what makes you so certain your right des? faith?well..

Des2      : Jrm....tell it all

Ravensong : I am a Pagan Des, I believe that the Universe is a whole, created 
            by forces

Des2      : The Alpha

Des2      : and Omega

Ravensong : that we don't remember, buit which we will someday.

VictorA6  : that is not al;ways true jrm..

Des2      : Ah yes, Raven....the force of The Holy One

JRM0646   : Victor where are you from?

ScottD32  : God creates

KlemClone : After that, Grey, we'll go to Iran, they'll change your mind 
            too...

Unnefer   : he who knows does not speak-he who speaks does not know

Greysoul  : :)

VictorA6  : originally or now, jrm?

Greysoul  : klem

KlemClone : or at least your posture

JRM0646   : both

Des2      : Been there Klem....The ayatollah sez hello

Ravensong : The Multiverse we live in is many many universes connected by 
            many seperate realities

Des2      : He who seeks to know...must first learn to imagine and 
            deliberate...

Unnefer   : right on raven!

ScottD32  : WHAT RAVEN???

VictorA6  : originally from Dallas then I moved to Puerto Rico then Mexico 
            City and now McAllen texas

Des2      : the wish to know contains not always the faculty to acquire.

Greysoul  : why do you think we have to follow jesus to live for ever why not 
            just do good
