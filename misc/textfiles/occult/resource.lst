Here's a list of current places that I've received catalogs from, and
think you might be interested in.  If I've used them, I've tried to
say so.  Catalogs are often fun reading in themselves - the ones like
Joan Teresa or Papa Jim will be useful to Ceremonial Magickians as
well as the other folks.  Lady Bountiful and Moonscents are,
obviously, wiccan in nature.  Many fall inbetween.  This is by no
means a complete list - just what I happen to have at the moment.  If
you get a catalog from somewhere you like, let me know!  -=Satinka
