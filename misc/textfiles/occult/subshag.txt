  Heed my words, oh miniscule and pulchritudinous ones.  Hear and heed, you
  who do not fellatiate, and you who know not the meaning of the great and
  high remex.  The end is near.  You must heed and follow the things I will
  speak unto you, the words of the great gods, the god of the windowshade,
  the god of the distributor cap, the god of the blue bikini underwear and
  most importantly the god of the dead japanese beetle somewhere on the
  campus of rutgers university.  By heeding these words, you will improve
  the gas mileage of your car, enter into a new age of harmony, peace,
  happiness, and belgian waffles.  Bring things home each day and not pay
  for them until next september, and make sure that your live is sanctioned
  and guarded by the great race of aliens which will land any day now in
  Starkville Mississippi and revolutionise the way you wash dishes.  Be sure
  to not be left out when all human males become obsolete as females flock
  to the alien males and their new, improved, user-friendly genitalia mark
  five systems!  You must make your genitalia blue, anointing it with
  indigo. Anoint also your ears, your nose, the back of your neck, and the
  fourth toe of each foot, the most holy of all toes.

  I speak to you of the coming of the greater race.  You shall know them by
  their stature, by their countenance, by their language, unlike any that
  man has ever heard, and by their sexual prowess.  Behold, they shall land
  in a small town, Starkille, and shall walk the earth among the children,
  and you shall not know them.  Many will say in those days, "The gods are
  walking the earth, the gods are walking the earth," but they shall be
  scoffed upon and spit upon and fucked hard by prostitutes in cheap motels
  then bankrupted by the media.  But you will pay them no attention and
  merely stop sending your donations.  But then, the greater race will
  reveal themselves in all their glory for all mankind to see.  The truth
  will be known, and the truth will be that mankind has not paid their lease
  and is being evicted, a new race takes over the planet, please move the
  furniture out and clean the carpeting before you leave.  Behold a wonder:
  your children and their children shall mate, producing a better race yet,
  but you, the unbelievers, shall be sentenced to 40 time units of wandering
  in the outer dust clouds of the andromeda sector aboard a tiny spaceship
  called the minnow.
   
  So, lo, woe, yo, repent while you still are young on an archaelogic scale.
  The world must be saved by the horrors that are low-density disks, AM
  radio, and non-FOX television.  You must learn to live without processed
  spinach products, to wean your children on their father's milk,. and to
  accept that power strips and LSD are things of the past.  Synthesise your
  offspring carefully so that when the time of the great choosing comes,
  your sons and daughters may be chosen by the greater race to participate
  in furthering their race, in the strange ritual of the cosmic fuck, the
  antithesis of the hells of knowledge, riches, and power, the fulfillment
  of the postmodern dream of red lights, t-squares, and paint blotches.
  Prepare yourselves for the day of the final inkblot judgement, wherein all
  shall be tested for blot and blood type.  In that day, some will say,
  "verily, it is an aston-martin, in O positive."  To those, the coming one
  will say, "farewell, you were never a phlebotomist, just a prick, depart
  from here into an eternity of dimness and cheap paperback novels and
  genuine IBM computers."  But in that fateful day, some will say, "truly,
  it is two schnauzers chasing a naked woman, in AB negative."  To those,
  the coming one will say, "come, join me at the cosmic sock hop, you are
  one of my own, you will live an eternity of free drinks and beautiful
  tragically hip waifs."
   
  For I have been spoken these things by the angels of light, hermetic
  seals, and the small purple man painted on my wall, who read them from the
  great platinum plates upon which they were inscribed from the supernatural
  force of the great god of the cunny, who swallows all things for the
  better of his followers.  I have seen the light, I have been enlightened,
  I speak the truth to you, heed it and save your lives and those of your
  fellow neighbour's wife and your neighbour's ass, or do not hear my words,
  and turn a deaf ear to them, and forever suffer in this meaningless
  existance.  The gods have spoken, I have written, and the pen, having
  writ, runs out of ink, on this, the next to the last of the last days...

Yes...It's true...

In the movie "5White 6Christmas0" by Irving Berlin...

You see, Danny Kay (I think) plays a former salesman in the early 50s named
"Bob" who wanders around with Bing Crosby and two young ladies...

Danny looks an awful lot like "Bob" in the film and even smokes a pipe
in one scene!

Truly this is Christmas slack at it's best...

See "Bob" dress up as a woman!  See "Bob" sing and dance!  See "Bob" suck face
with some blonde!  Hear "Bob" sing "Gee, I wish I was back in the army!"
Watch as "Bob" is totally confounded by the female sex!

The only downside is that when he dresses as a woman, he wears pink...

Let us not speak of Ferraris and Audis and other pacifiers of the
CON generation.  Those adult playthings that are sucked upon to
please the Andrew Jacksonheads in our pockets.  Pablumstyles of
the Rich and would-be-famous.

Let us speak instead of the Xists Giant Terrarium, that ozone depleted
chunk of rock we call the Earth.  It is now nearly 2000 years since
a guy was nailed to a tree for saying how nice it would be if we would
all give each other some slack.

Things are even weirder now than they were then and this is the first
run-on sentence of the third paragraph and if you don't like it, well
kill me, and I'll just keep right on talking, er, typing, er having
telepathy with this silicon life form because I just had a Margarita
on a Sunday afternoon after decorating the house because the CON says
I should and I don't want to blow my cover just yet because great things
are in store for the following solar year that the CON says is 1991 but
really isn't because they've brainwashed us all and changed the calendar
on us and decided not to tell the really stupid people because they might
panic and then the CON would have a whole pile of excrement on their
collective appendages and the Sunday afternoon Sun coming through my
office window is setting on my would-be-bleeding head and Frosty the
Snowman is on the root window of my Xist Window screen and I'm feeling

Oh wow.  There's a cloud outside my window that looks like a flying

THANKS SLACKY PEOPLE!
 
My postings seem to be staying up again.  Maybe the lab realized my slackness
 and decided not to mess with me, eh?  Perhaps it was "BoB" intervention...
 Well, as of now things are in the range of semi-okay with posting, but if my
 posts don't last, I now have a "support group" of slackypeople who will post
 for me.  Aren't us computer geeks a great big family!!!
 
Also, a little contribution to alt.slack:
 
        "Slack as a prefix" Dictionary:
 
Slackola        (n)  Bye, slack
Slacky          (adj)  slack
To slack        (v)  slack
Slackness       (adv?)  slack
Slackly         (adj)  slack
Slacky-Slack-Slack      (n,adj,v,adv,prep,article...)  REALLY SLACK!!
Slacking        (v)  slack
Slackment       (n)  slack
Slackmented     (n)  slack, past tense
Slackmentfull   (n)  full of ment slack???
Slackmentfulled (v)  Yeah, right.  Just slack
Slackous        (adv)  of slack
Sa-LACK!        (n)  Hick excited slack
Slack           (n)  If you don't know what it means, stop everything now.  
Just
plain die.
 
 
There ya go, sorry if it's not in alphabetic and all, and that the (n), (adj)
etc.. are probably not right, but this is just a first draft.  Remember:
        Slack ain't your enemy, but it sure as hell ain't your friend.
 
Praise Frith-rah and Slackola,
Dave

Brothers  and sisters,  again I feel compelled to update you on the
single greatest source of slack known to mankind:


4Bob Tilton.0

Yes, your favorite TV evangelist is still out there and GOING STRONG!
Ever since I called the Robert Tilton Ministries at (214) 620-6200 and
asked for my "free book", I have been mailed, free of charge:

The aforementioned book, _God's Miracle Plan for Man_ (5$$$0 --> salvation)
Three "miracle" prayer cloths
A package of miracle anointing oil
The Jordan River Holy Anointing Water flask
5 large posters of Bob
The "Miracle Ropes of Deliverance" to "Bind Demons" (see p.128, #15, the BOOK)
Several copies of their magazines and newspapers
Many, many, many "convincing" Biblical arguments for why I should send $$$$
...and lots more!


4Bob Tilton is a SubGenius.0


Here are a few reasons why:

1) He rips off pinks for a living
2) He rants like a mother fucker ("Satan I BIND THEE!  Demons of
tobacco smoking I BIND THEE!  Demons of lymph node cancer I BIND
THEE!")  In fact, in his latest rant, just today he said: "I'm a Pink
Duck, I'm not a white duck!  They don't know what to do with me!
Everyone else is a white duck, they just waddle around...I'm drunk
with the holy spirit today...I'm a Pink Duck..."
3) He signs everything "Bob", (no quotes, but close enough!)
4) Where does he live?  Dallas, TX?  Hmmm...
5) The latest copy of his newspaper had a drawing on the cover that
looked almost exactly like the cover of "Three-Fisted Tales", except
it was Tilton's face instead of J.R.'s.  The article is entitled,
"Take Your Foot Off the Brake"...sound familiar?


If you want to fall over laughing every couple of days when you read
your mail, call (214) 620-6200 and ask them to "send you information."
You'll be on their mailing list for months.  Don't give them your
phone number, though.  Do it, or kill me.


I usually have too much slack to even care about posting, but
something about this article in the latest issue of "Circle of
Blessing", written by Tilton's wife made me do it:

"You wives must submit to your husbands' leadership in the same way
you submit to the Lord.  For a husband is in charge of his wife in the
same way Christ is in charge of his Body the Church...So you wives
must willingly obey your husbands in everything, just as the Church
obeys Christ."  -Marte Tilton

God I love fundamentalists.  Praise "Bob" (& Bob!)


-St. Mog the Unholy

"`Brakes' are all that keep us from committing ANYTHING WE MIGHT
IMAGINE IN OUR MOST WARPED FANTASIES"

"Take your foot off the brake!"
                  -Bob Tilton, "Circle of Blessing", Oct 1990 p.12
