    Hah!  What did I tell ya 'bout them welders gogs!  Foo!
<erp>


    DOC!: Jus - the Knox shit is what you add to jello to make Knox Blox,
amaze and confuse your cats, chickens, banana slug aunts etc.  You guessed it
perfectly.  Have you ever eaten ˛ in NetHack?  I believe it turns you into a
wand of self-evaluation, so in other words you become an actual argument
expression, like a command in a programming language.  Then as soon as some
other fortunate fuck happens along and sees you, his eyes unlock your secret
and you self-evaluate and/or apply where needed, and spring back into being
again!  Of course you don't notice any of this because it happens when you're
not looking.  Like when you get up for a Weidermann's Bohemian Special, or
aLucky Lager with the ol' rebus in the cap - those were the days.

    Are you getting all this down?  When does the Jello texfile come out?


    plus this.  i've been thinking about all that auto-evaluation shit for
quite some time now, and (get this) I think there must be all kinds of places
where there's a little node of self-evaluation delayed-argument stuff just
waiting to be seen or referred to.  Like say there's a spot on somebody's
shoe, which is rigged to explode itself into a whole series of nearby events
(disguised as everyday life!), and this will be triggered when somebody looks
at that exact spot.  But say no one has ever, ever looked at this EXACT spot
on the shoe, ok, before in history.  And then you walk along and glance at it
without even planning to, and this causes uncounted, untold things to happen,
like some little girl in Bangkok stubs her toe, and a man drops his hat in
Davis.  see?  I believe the whole world is rigged like this and everything is
stuck together in one big web.  Everything has little imperceptible
receptacles embedded in it, so that it is ready to accept information from
someplace else and trigger more shit than ever before.  ANd one of the things
that can be triggered is the setting up of new evaluators someplace else, so
it's a self-sustaining reaction!  Neat, huh.  Actually this is just a metaphor
for quantum mechanix huh?

    Now the best part of it all, is that these things can sometimes, rarely,
sort of "invent themselves" without any input from ANYWHERE.  This occurs most
often with Jello and chicken, although the probability of it happening with
any one item is vastly increased by the presence of sweat socks.  I tried it
once with a whole fucking lot of socks, and succeeded in creating a 300 foot
tower of ice with a little observatory on top and a set of stairs going up to
it... I went up and everything looked different from there but a migrating
flock of chickens was coming so I had to get down in a hurry.  Just one o'
them things...

    sign me, rat in a press.
