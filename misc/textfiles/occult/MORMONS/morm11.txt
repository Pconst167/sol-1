    Your ÿrecent ÿinquiry ÿconcerning ÿthe Book ÿof ÿMormon ÿhas ÿbeen 
received in the Smithsonian's Department of Anthropology. 

    The ÿbook ÿof Mormon is a religious document and not a ÿscientific 
guide.  ÿÿThe Smithsonian Institution does not use it in archeological 
research.  Because the Smithsonian Institution receives many inquiries 
regarding the book of Mormon, ÿwe have prepared a "Statement Regarding 
the Book of Mormon," a copy of which is enclosed for your information. 
This statement includes answers to questions most commonly asked about 
the Book of Mormon. 


                             PREPARED BY 
                    THE DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY 
                STATEMENT REGARDING THE BOOK OF MORMON 
                --------------------------------------

1.  ÿÿThe Smithsonian Institution has never used the Book of Mormon in 
any way as a scientific guide.  ÿThe Smithsonian archaeologists see no 
direct ÿconnection between archeology of the New World and the subject 
matter of the book. 

2.  The physical type of American Indian is basically Mongoloid, being 
most closely related to that of the peoples of eastern, ÿcentral, ÿand 
northeastern ÿÿAsia.  ÿÿArcheological ÿevidence ÿindicates ÿthat ÿÿthe 
ancestors ÿof the present Indians came into the New World -- ÿprobably 
over ÿa land bridge known to have existed in the Bering Strait ÿregion 
during the last Ice Age -- ÿin a continuing series of small migrations 
beginning from about 25,000 to 30,000 years ago. 

3.  ÿÿPresent ÿevidence indicates that the fist people to ÿreach ÿthis 
continent from the East were the Norsemen who who briefly visited ÿthe 
northeastern part of North America around A.D. ÿ1000 ÿand then settled 
in ÿGreenland.  ÿThere is nothing to show that they reached Mexico ÿor 
Central America. 

4.  ÿÿOne ÿof ÿthe main lines of evidence ÿsupporting ÿthe ÿscientific 
finding ÿthat contacts with Old World civilizations, ÿif ÿindeed ÿthey 
occurred at all, ÿwere of very little significance for the development 
of ÿAmerican ÿIndian ÿcivilizations, ÿÿis the fact that ÿnone ÿof ÿthe 
principal ÿOld World domesticated ÿfood plants or animals (except ÿthe 
dog) ÿÿoccurred in the New ÿWorld ÿin pre-Columbian times.  ÿÿAmerican 
Indians had ÿno ÿwheat, ÿbarley, ÿoats, ÿmillet, rice, ÿcattle, ÿpigs, 
chickens, horses, ÿdonkeys, ÿcamels ÿbefore 1492.  ÿ(camels and horses 
were in the Americas, along with the bison, mammoth, mastodon, but all 
these animals became extinct around 10,000 B.C. ÿat the time the early 
big game hunters spread across the Americas.) 

5.  Iron, steel, glass, and silk were not used in the New World before 
1492 ÿ(except for occasional use of unsmelted meteoric iron).  ÿNative 
copper ÿwas worked in various locations in pre-Columbian ÿtimes, ÿÿbut 
true ÿmetallurgy was limited to southern Mexico and the Andean region, 
where its occurrance in late prehistoric times involved gold, ÿsilver, 
copper, and their alloys, but not iron. 

6.  ÿThere is a possibility that the spread of cultural traits ÿacross 
the Pacific to Mesoamerica and the northwestern coast of South America 
began several hundred years before the Christian era.  ÿHowever, ÿÿany 
such ÿinter-hemispheric ÿcontacts appear to have been the ÿresults ÿof 
accidental voyages originating in eastern and southern Asia.  It is by 
no ÿmeans ÿcertain that even such contacts occurred with ÿthe ÿancient 
Egyptians, ÿÿHebrews, ÿor other peoples of Western Asia and ÿthe ÿNear 
East. 

7.  ÿÿNo ÿreputable ÿEgyptologist or other ÿspecialist ÿon ÿOld ÿWorld 
archeology, ÿand no expert on New World prehistory, ÿhas discovered or 
confirmed any relationship between archeological remains in Mexico and 
archeological remains in Egypt. 

8.  ÿÿReports of findings of ancient Egyptian, ÿHebrew, ÿand other Old 
World ÿwritings ÿin ÿthe ÿNew World ÿin ÿpre-Columbian ÿcontexts ÿhave 
frequently ÿappeared in newspapers, ÿmagazines and sensational ÿbooks. 
None ÿof ÿthese ÿclaims ÿhas ÿstood up ÿto ÿexamination ÿby ÿreputable 
scholars.  ÿNo inscriptions using Old World forms of writing have been 
shown to have occurred in any part of the Americas before 1492 ÿexcept 
for a few Norse rune stones which have been found in Greenland. 

9.  ÿÿThere ÿare ÿcopies of the Book of Mormon in the library ÿof ÿthe 
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution.
