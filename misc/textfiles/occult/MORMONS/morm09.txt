
                   TEN REASONS WHY I CANNOT BE A MORMON 
                           by Rev. John Hornok 

1.  ÿMORMONISM DOES NOT TEACH THAT THE BIBLE IS THE INFALLIBLE WORK OF 
GOD.  ÿÿ"We ÿbelieve the Bible to the the Word of God as far as it ÿis 
translated ÿcorrectly; ÿÿwe also believe the book of Mormon to be ÿthe 
word of God"  (Articles of Faith, No. 8). 

    As ÿChristians we believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old ÿand ÿNew 
Testaments ÿto ÿthe ÿthe verbally inspired Word ÿof ÿGod, ÿÿthe ÿfinal 
authority ÿfor ÿfaith and life, ÿinerrant in ÿthe ÿoriginal ÿwritings, 
infallible and God-breathed (2 ÿTim. ÿ3:16-17; ÿ2 Pet. ÿ1:20-21; ÿMatt 
5:18). 

2.  ÿÿMORMONISM TEACHES THAT GOD IS AN EXALTED MAN AND HAS A ÿPHYSICAL 
BODY.  ÿÿ"God himself was once as we are now, ÿand is an exalted ÿman" 
(Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, ÿpg. 345).  ÿ"The Father has a 
body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's..." ÿ(Doc. ÿ& Cov., ÿSec. 
131:22) 

    The Bible says, ÿ"God is not a man..." ÿ(Num. ÿ23:19).  ÿ"God is a 
Spirit; ÿÿand they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and ÿin 
truth" ÿÿ(John 4:24).  ÿ"A spirit hath not flesh and ÿbones..." ÿÿ(Lk. 
24:39). 

3.  MORMONISM TEACHES THAT CHRIST AND THE DEVIL ARE BROTHERS. "...that 
Lucifer, ÿthe son of morning, ÿis our elder brother and the brother of 
Jesus Christ"  (Mormon Doctrine by Bruce McConkie, pp. 163-4). 

    The Bible says that the devil is a created being, ÿcreated by God. 
"thou ÿwast ÿperfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast ÿcreated, 
till ÿiniquity ÿwas found in thee"  ÿ(Ezekiel 28:15).  ÿÿ"For ÿby ÿHim 
(Christ) ÿwere all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in 
earth, ÿvisible and invisible, whether they be thrones, ÿof dominions, 
or principalities, ÿor powers; ÿall things were created by Him and for 
Him..."  (Col. 1:15-17). 

4.  MORMONISM TEACHES THAT JESUS WAS MARRIED AND THE HE IS POLYGAMOUS. 
"We ÿsay ÿit ÿwas ÿJesus Christ who was married at ÿCana ÿof ÿGalilee" 
(Journal of Discourses, ÿVol 2, p. 80).  ÿMormonism teaches that Jesus 
was ÿthe ÿnatural ÿchild ÿof Adam and Mary.  ÿ"When ÿthe ÿVirgin ÿMary 
conceived ÿthe Child Jesus....He was not begotten by the ÿHoly ÿGhost. 
And who is his Father?  ÿHe is the first of the human family" (Brigham 
Young, Journal of Discourses, pp. 50-51). 

    The Bible says, ÿ"In the beginning was the Word (Christ), ÿand the 
Word was with God, and the Word was God;...The Word was made flesh and 
dwelt among us..."  ÿ(John 1:1, 14).  ÿ"Then Mary said unto the angel, 
How ÿshall ÿthis ÿbe, ÿseeing that I know not a man?  ÿAnd ÿthe ÿangel 
answered... The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee..."(Lk. 1:34-35). 

5.  ÿÿMORMONISM TEACHES THAT THE TRUE CHURCH CEASED TO EXIST UNTIL ÿIT 
WAS RESTORED TO JOSEPH SMITH.  ÿThe church (LDS) was restored April 6, 
1830 by Joseph Smith (Doc. & Cov., 20:1). 

    Jesus ÿChrist said, ÿ"I will build my church and the gates of hell 
shall not prevail against it" ÿ(Matt. ÿ16:18).  ÿ"for other foundation 
can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 
3:11).  ÿÿ"...And ÿare built upon the foundation of the ÿapostles ÿand 
prophets, ÿÿJesus ÿChrist himself being the chief cornerstone" ÿÿ(Eph. 
2:20). 

6.  ÿÿMORMONISM TEACHES ANOTHER (PERVERTED) ÿGOSPEL THAN THAT ÿOF ÿTHE 
BIBLE.  ÿÿThe gospel to Mormonism is:  ÿ"Faith, ÿRepentance, ÿBaptism, 
Receiving the Holy Spirit by laying on of hands, ÿMorality, ÿÿLoyalty, 
Tithing, ÿWord of Wisdom, Duty Celestial Marriage (for eternity)" (LDS 
chart of FREE AGENCY and Articles of Faith, No. 4). 

    The Bible says, "Moreover brethren, I ÿdeclare unto you the gospel 
that he was buried, ÿand that he rose again the third day according to 
the scriptures"  ÿ(1 ÿCor. 15:1, ÿ3-4).  ÿ"if any man preach any other 
gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed" (Gal. 
1:9). 

7.  ÿÿMORMONISM ÿTEACHES ÿSALVATION FOR THE THE DEAD ÿBY ÿPROXY ÿWATER 
BAPTISM.  This doctrine is based on one misunderstood Scripture: "Else 
what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, ÿif the dead ÿrise 
not at all?  Why are they then baptized for the dead?" (1 Cor. 15:29). 

    Paul ÿdid not practice baptism for the dead.  ÿHe excluded himself 
by using the pronoun "they" rather than "we" ÿor "ye".  He is asking a 
question ÿrather than making a statement.  ÿ"It is appointed unto ÿman 
once to die, but after this the judgment" (Heb. 9:27). 

8.  ÿMORMONISM TEACHES GENEALOGICAL RESEARCH FOR THE DEAD.  ÿ"Let ÿus, 
therefore, ÿas a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, ÿoffer 
unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; ÿand let us present in his 
holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our 
dead, ÿwhich shall be worth of all acceptation" ÿ(Doc. ÿ& ÿCov., ÿSec. 
128:24). 

    The ÿBible ÿsays, ÿÿ"Neither ÿgive ÿheed ÿto ÿfables ÿand ÿendless 
genealogies" ÿÿ(1 ÿÿTim. ÿÿ1:4).  ÿ"but ÿavoid ÿfoolish ÿquestion ÿand 
genealogies..." (Titus 3:9). 

9.  ÿÿMORMONISM TEACHES THAT THERE ARE MODERN DAY PROPHETS AND ÿMODERN 
DAY REVELATIONS FROM GOD.  Mormonism claims that Joseph Smith received 
the ÿAaronic ÿPriesthood ÿfrom John ÿthe ÿBaptist.  ÿÿThe ÿMelchizedek 
Priesthood and Apostleship ÿwas ÿrestored ÿby Peter, ÿÿJames ÿand John 
shortly afterwards in 1829 (Doc. & Cov., Sec. 13). 

    The Bible says, ÿ"God...hath in these last days spoken unto us ÿby 
his ÿSon, ÿwhom he hath appointed heir of all things, ÿby whom also he 
made ÿthe worlds" ÿ(Heb. ÿ1:1-2).  ÿThe test of a prophet is given ÿin 
Deut. 18:20-22. 

10. ÿÿMORMONISM ÿTEACHES THAT SALVATION DEPENDS UPON ÿGOOD ÿWORKS ÿAND 
ACCEPTANCE ÿOF ÿJOSEPH SMITH.  ÿ"No man who rejects the ÿtestimony ÿof 
Joseph ÿSmith can enter the kingdom of God" ÿ(Doctrines of ÿSalvation, 
vol. 1 pg. 190).  "Men have work to do it they would obtain salvation" 
(Doctrines of Salvation. vol. 3, pg 91). 

    The ÿBible ÿteaches ÿthat salvation is provided ÿby ÿJesus ÿChrist 
alone, ÿÿ"for ÿthere is none other name under heaven given among ÿmen, 
whereby we must be saved" (Acts 4:10-12).  ÿ"For by grace are ye saved 
through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.  Not 
of works, lest any man should boast" (Eph. 2:8-9).
