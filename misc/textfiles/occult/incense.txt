
Hi!
I have made an incense (to burn on charcaol) that is:

1 part Frankincense
1 part nutmeg
1 part cinnamon
and a pinch of clove

Be sure to grind the Frankincense alone in sharp snapping movements, if you 
dont buy it powdered. It has a tendency to gum up (being a resin) if you drag 
it across the bottom of the mortar.

I have used this for rituals involving money and job relations. I have met 
with fantastic success with it. Good luck!

Blessed Be!
Chloe

Greetings All...

      A friend has graciously offered to give me some recipes for
various incenses that you can make yourself by taking a simple
stroll to the Bookstore or Metaphysical Supply Shoppe.  I hope
that you enjoy them..
      Most of the following recipes call for mixing "Equal" parts
of each ingredient.  However, I have found that it makes for
