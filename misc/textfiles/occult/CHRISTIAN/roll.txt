Just  as  there  is  no  such thing as a Christian 
porno  shop,  (though  I  have  heard  some  claim 
such), there is no such thing as Christian Rock-N-
Roll.   The  two  words  cannot mix.  No more than 
God can have any fellowship with darkness.

There  is  such  a  thing  as  Holy music unto the 
Lord!   And  though  it may have drums and guitars 
in  the  music,  it's  style and spiritual quality 
will  not  resemble  the world.  You will not find 
the  smoke,  lights,  dress  and  loudness  of the 
music   to   be  anything  like  the  world.   For 
Christians  are  a  holy  separate people unto the 
Lord.


*    *    *    *  AMY GRANT    *    *     *     *

But  we  go even deeper than that in our judgement 
of  Christian  rock  music.   For the music can be 
mellow  and  sweet  to the ears, but come straight 
from  the  pit  of hell.  One example is the music 
of  Any  Grant.  She has sold her royal birthright 
for  the  pleasures and praise of this world.  And 
we have told her and her pastor so.  

As  most  will  know that Any Grant's stage symbol 
is  a  leopard jacket.  This is prophetic!  God is 
showing  to  all  discerning  Christians  what her 
true nature is.

        "Can the Ethiopian change his skin
                        or
               the leopard its spot?
    Neither can you do good who are accustomed
         to doing evil."  -Jeremiah 13:23

What  must  be judged here is not just the music's 
style  but  the heart that sings it.  Noting also, 
that  if  the  heart  is  right, the style will be 
also.   For  if  a tree is good, so is it's fruit.   


*    *    *   ATTRACTING THE WORLD   *   *   *   

So  many  of  you  clamor that they are attracting 
people  to  Jesus  by using the world's music.  By 
becoming  a  Roman  to  the  Romans.   What wicked 
reasoning  that  is!   What  mis-use of scripture!  
Shall  our church sell Coors on the church parking 
lot  to  attract  the  non-believers?   Shall  our 
Christian  sisters  dress  like the world in order 
to pull in the worldly?

It  is   of  the  highest  darkness  to  use  such 
reasoning.   Jesus  said,  "be  careful  that  the 
light  within  you  is  not darkness"!  Peter says 
that  Christians  who  use  worldliness to attract 
people  to  Jesus  are  of  the highest caliber of 
false prophets!

    "...Blackest darkness is reserved for them.
     For they mouth empty, boastful words and,
   by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful
   human nature they entice people who are just
   escaping from those who live in error.  They
     promise them freedom..." -2 Peter 2:17-19


*    *    *    *    CHOICE    *    *    *    *   

You  have  a  choice.   To hunger and thirst after 
righteousness.    To   avoid  all  music  that  is 
unholy.   To  refuse  to  buy records of those who 
have  sold  out  to the world.  To call others not 
to go their concerts.  Or to compromise.

It  is  our  prayer that you will choose to listen 
to  those  who are faithful in the land.  To those 
that  show  they  love  the Lord.  And if there be 
not  much  music you can buy or listen to, then so 
be  it.   Make  "music  in your heart" to the Lord 
instead!   He will be more pleased with that, then 
the  supporting  of  those  who  copy the world in 
dress,  hair  and  music.   God  does  not support 
hypocrisy, and neither should you.

      "My eyes will be on the faithful in the
       land, that they may dwell with me; he
   whose walk is blameless will minister to me.
     No one who practices deceit will dwell in
            my house..." -Psalm 101:6-7

Only  as we stand and speak up for what is holy in 
the  Lord  will  the  steady downward trend toward 
the  pit  of  hellish  activity be stopped.  Write 
KLTT  and other stations that support such utterly 
wicked  groups as STRYPER.  Call your brothers and 
sisters  to  avoid  such  concerts  as Steve Camp, 
Mylon  LaFevor  and  Steve  Taylor etc. etc..  Put 
away  the  Any  Grant  albums.   "Touch no unclean 
thing"   and   God  will  receive  you.   Let  the 
faithful  be  the  only ones who minister to you - 
FORGET  HOW GOOD THEIR WORDS ARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
That's  what  makes  them  so very wicked in God's 
sight.

                DRIVEN TO DARKNESS!
                        BY
                  DAVID WILKERSON
                    (8-3-1987)

"'To  the  law and to the testimony; if they speak 
not  according  to  this word, it is because there 
is  no  light  in  them...And they shall look unto 
the  earth;  and  behold trouble and darkness; and 
they  shall  be driven to darkness.' -Isaiah 8:20-
22

   Last   night   I  attended  a  Christian  music 
festival.   I  will  never  forget what I saw, and 
can  truly  say  was  a  heartbreaking experience.  
Since  leaving the concert I have been weeping for 
hours,  groaning  in the Spirit, feeling the wrath 
of a holy God burning against what I saw.

   I  went  to  the  festival  because  the  'star 
performer'  featured  last  night  had  been in my 
office  just  hours before, crying, telling me how 
much  he  loved  Jesus, how sincere he was, how he 
wanted  to  learn more about holiness.  He told me 
my  written  messages  convicted  him.   His words 
sounded  right-his attitude seemed humble.  At his 
request  I  went to hear him and his group because 
he assured me I would not be offended.

   My  heart  is  now  so set on the massive human 
need  in  New York City, and my great concerns now 
have  to  do  with rescuing lost souls from drugs, 
alcohol  and  demon possession.  I DID NOT WANT TO 
GET  INVOLVED  ANYMORE  IN  THE MATTER OF ROCK AND 
ROLL,  HEAVY  METAL, AND PUNK MUSIC IN THE CHURCH. 
I  felt  I  had  said  enough on the subject and I 
told  the  musician  so  when he sat in my office.  
We  have  prayed together and I hugged him when he 
left my office.

   I  went  last night with an open heart, full of 
love  and compassions - for him, for all Christian 
musicians,  and  especially  for  the  3,000 or so 
young   people  attending  the  festival.   I  sat 
through  two  devotional-type  songs,  then  I sat 
attentively  listening  as  the musician testified 
about  what  he  said Christ had done in his life.  
No  preacher  anywhere could have spoken with more 
conviction  and  sincerity-the  words  were right.  
He  spoke  of  separation,  of  being  obedient to 
Jesus,  of  winning  souls,  of  prayer,  of  holy 
matrimony  [he  was  married],  of  living  a holy 
life.   I  prayed as he spoke, 'Dear Lord, maybe I 
misjudged  this  musician and his hard rock group. 
Maybe  you  ARE  doing  something new in using the 
music  the  ungodly  prefer,  to  win  them-to get 
their  attention,  to  attract them so they can be 
ministered  to.   Lord, I am willing to rejoice in 
hearing  You  preached,  in  any  manner, from any 
group-if  You  are  present  in  it-if  your  Holy 
Spirit is blessing it.

   I  was  honestly  questioning  if  my  writings 
about  the  MUSIC  OF  DEVILS  in God's house were 
just   old-fashioned   prejudices   or  simply  my 
distaste  for  rock  music.   Was  it just so much 
fuss  about  nothing?  Yet something was not quite 
right.   There was an inner tug at my heart making 
me   ill  at  ease.   I  reasoned,  'If  Satan  is 
camouflaged  in  this  somehow, if there is leaven 
of   evil-it   will  be  revealed.   Satan  always 
reveals himself in one way or another.'

   Suddenly  the  singer yelled in the microphone, 
'JESUS  IS COMING - HE IS GOING TO CRACK THE SKIES 
-  GET  READY!'  The song was entitled, 'CRACK THE 
SKIES'.   Suddenly  smoke  was  billowing  out  of 
smoke  machines,  the  pounding beat was turned up 
to  a frenzied pitch, eerie lights began flashing, 
the  musicians  stood  like phantoms rising from a 
murky  swamp.   It was ghostly, weird, strange-and 
the  crowd  went  wild-they seemed to love it.  At 
the  same  festival,  a wild spiked hair group had 
entertained-with  painted  faces,  prancing  about 
like homosexual peacocks.

   At  first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing 
on  stage.   I  said  out  loud,  'This  can't  be 
happening  at  a  Christian festival-they can't do 
this  to  my  Jesus!   These  people can't be this 
blind-the  leaders of this youth ministry can't be 
so  undiscerning!   Oh  God-what  has  happened to 
your  church  that  its  leaders, it people, can't 
see the evil of this abomination?

   Suddenly  I  was  on  the  ground,  on my back, 
weeping  and sobbing, and groaning in t he Spirit. 
I  sat  up  and took another look at the stage.  I 
WAS  HORRIFIED BY WHAT I SAY IN THE SPIRIT.  I SAW 
DEMONIC  IMAGES  RISING  FROM  THE  THAT STAGE!  I 
HEARD  SATAN  LAUGHING!  Laughing at all the blind 
parents-the  blind  shepherds-the  blind youth-the 
backslidden    church!     It    was    an   overt 
manifestation  of  Satan-worse  than anything I've 
ever seen on the streets of New York.

   I  stood to my feet, literally shaking with the 
fear  of  God-consumed  with  a  sense of His holy 
wrath  against such wickedness.  I rushed into the 
crowd  crying at the top of my voice-ICHABOD! {The 
glory  of  the Lord has departed!} ICHABOD!  I ran 
through  the crowd, pushing aside chairs, weeping, 
shouting  at the top of my voice, 'Ichabod-this is 
satanic!  Stop!  God  is  grieved!'   I was mostly 
ignored  and  I  think  most thought I was a crazy 
lunatic.   I  doubt  anybody  knew  who  I was-the 
musicians  could  not  hear  me, and the crowd was 
too  tight  to  allow me near the stage.  I wanted 
to  get  to  a  microphone and cry like an Elijah-
'THIS  IS  VOMIT ON THE TABLE OF THE LORD! WHO ARE 
YOUR  TEACHERS,  THAT  YOU  COULD  BE SO BLIND, SO 
WORLDLY,  SO DECEIVED!?  WHAT KIND OF BLASPHEMY IS 
THIS?'

   I  will not shut up this matter!  I will not be 
silent  while  multitudes  of  our Christian youth 
are  being  deceived  by  smooth-talking wolves in 
sheep's  clothing!   True  love  demands  that the 
truth be told.

   What  hurt  my  spirit the most, and what is so 
hard   for   me   to   understand,  is  that  this 
particular   group,   and   many   others,  attend 
Pentecostal  churches.   The  musician  I refer to 
told  me  he gave up drugs, drinking, evil sex and 
rock  and  roll  performing when he got saved.  He 
cut  his  long,  feminine  hair,  he quit dressing 
like  an exhibitionist and began to change all his 
ways.   It  was  a  pastor  who  encouraged him to 
'quit  looking  so square and use rock and roll to 
reach  the  kids'.   A  teacher,  in  his sixties, 
travels  on  occasion with them, teaching them and 
encouraging    them   in   their   evil   methods.  
According  to  their  teacher,  rock  and  roll is 
going  to  be the 'normal music in all Pentecostal 
and evangelical churches'.

   It's  now  the  middle of the night and I can't 
sleep!   I  can't  stop weeping inside.  I am shut 
in  with  God in my study diligently asking Him to 
show  me  what  is  happening, because hours ago I 
saw   a   few   thousand  young  Christians,  with 
uplifted  hands,  thinking  it  was Jesus, when it 
was  most  assuredly the devil.  HAS THE CHURCH-OR 
WHAT  MAN  CALLS  THE  CHURCH-SO  BACKSLIDDEN THAT 
THERE  IS NO MORE DISCERNMENT WHATSOEVER?  Has God 
given  up on some who are set on bringing devilish 
practices into the realm of worship?

   NOW  I  WONDER-'WHO  DARES  TEACH  SUCH JESUS-a 
Jesus  who winks at deception?  How blatantly they 
are  mislearning  Jesus  Christ!   WHAT  JESUS ARE 
THEY PREACHING?'

**************************************************
        'But Ye Have Not So Learned Christ'
                 [Ephesians 4:20]
**************************************************


   That  is  what  Paul  said in his letter to the 
Ephesians.   He  was  warning  them not to walk as 
some  do  'in  the  vanity  [pride] of their mind' 
(Ephesians  4:17).   He  warned  of  those learned 
Christ   in   a   perverted   way,  because  their 
understanding  was  darkened.   They were 'cut off 
from  the  life  of God through the ignorance that 
is  in  them,  because  of  the blindness of their 
heart' (Ephesians 4:18).

   Some  teacher,  some  shepherd,  had  MISTAUGHT 
JESUS  CHRIST  to  them.   The Christ they learned 
was  not  the Christ of God, the Lord of holiness, 
the   master  of  purity.   While  they  speak  so 
sweetly  of  Jesus, and weep when they mention the 
name,  and tell of a hunger to walk in the ways of 
Christ-Paul  said  of them, they 'ARE PAST FEELING 
AND    HAVE    GIVEN    THEMSELVES    OVER    UTNO 
LASCIVIOUSNESS    [lustfulness],   TO   WORK   ALL 
UNCLEANNESS WITH GREEDINESS' [Ephesians 4:19].

   That  is  what  I  saw  last night at the music 
festival-a   group  of  musicians  who  were  pied 
pipers,  leading  many young people right into the 
arms  of  Satan  with  their  smooth  words  about 
Jesus,  about celebrating forgiveness-then with an 
energy  of  flesh  and  carnal  greediness hard to 
fathom-they   put   their  stamp  of  approval  on 
paganism  right out of the devil's treasury.  They 
were  saying,  by  their  music and their worldly, 
ghastly  performance-that Jesus and the garbage of 
this  world  are compatible.  They wore two masks-
one  of  sincere followers of Christ, the other of 
performing  clowns.  With their faces lifted up to 
God,   they   cursed   Him  by  their  blasphemous 
mockery.   Isaiah  prophesied  of  such,  '...they 
shall  curse  their  king  and their God, and look 
upward'  [Isaiah  8:21].   What  they  preach  and 
practice are two different gospels.

   They  are  deceived,  and consequently they are 
deceivers   themselves.   They   have   MISLEARNED 
CHRIST!   They  have  been  duped, manipulated and 
cheated!    They  should  have  had  a  pastor  or 
teacher  with  enough Holy Ghost discernment, with 
enough  devotion to the true and holy Lord-to WARN 
THEM  TO  SHOW  THEM that God does not put up with 
holding  on  to  the  old  man  and the old carnal 
ways.   Why  didn't  their  shepherds discern that 
these   boys   were   walking   in  ignorance  and 
spiritual  blindness,  not  understanding the true 
demands  of  Christ?  Why wasn't their greed dealt 
with-not  so  much for money and fame, but a greed 
that  would not let go of the very thing that once 
led  them  into  drugs  and  emptiness.   It's all 
coming  out  now-that  these groups are falling on 
all  sides,  going back to the secular crowd, back 
to  cocaine,  back to groupies-playing the part of 
hypocrites  and  gospel  phonies.  Their shepherds 
are  so  easily  conned, because they are blind in 
every  way.   Paul  said  it  right,  'For it is a 
shame  even  to  speak  of  those things which are 
done  of  them in secret.' [Ephesians 5:12].  They 
very  music  they  perform  drives  them  back  to 
darkness.

   Now-it's   probably   too   late!    They  have 
rejected  the reproof of prophets and watchmen who 
really  preach  the  truth!   They  are like those 
Paul  warns  about,  who  have  become  so lost in 
spiritual   ignorance   and  blindness,  they  are 
confirmed  in  their  worldly  ways!   They are so 
blind  they  believe  they are honoring Christ and 
blessing  multitudes  of  youth  the church 'can't 
reach'.

          Sin-Soft Preachers Are Driving
           This Generation Into Darkness

**************************************************

'...they shall be driven to darkness...'
                    [Isaiah 8:22]

   I   blame   their   smooth   talking,  sin-soft 
shepherds.   Those  same  shepherds  must  one day 
stand  before  Christ's judgement seat and answer-
not  only  for  the musicians under their care-but 
for  all  the  Christian young people they in turn 
have  hurt  and  destroyed.   Without flinching, I 
declare  that  cowardly  ministers, those who want 
to  be  loved and honored rather than rejected for 
preaching  truth, are driving this generation into 
deep spiritual darkness.

   We   would   not  be  facing  a  generation  of 
backslidden,   pleasure-loving,   worldly   minded 
youth  in  our churches-youth who do not even know 
the  commandments  of a holy Christ-IF WE HAD MORE 
HOLY  BOLD  PREACHERS  AND  EVANGELISTS  WHO COULD 
TEACH  AND  PREACH THE TRUTH OF CHRIST WITH PURITY 
AND AUTHORITY.

   I  am  not accusing all preachers and teachers-
thank  God  for  the few who still do not cower to 
the  crowd  or  compromise for the sake of numbers 
and  success.   Maybe  the  youth  won't listen to 
those  who cry out against their lusting after the 
world-but   when  the  judgements  accelerate-they 
will  turn to the preachers of holiness for a sure 
word from God.

   There  is  filth  in  Zion,  and strangers have 
been   exalted  in  the  house  of  God-by  blind, 
compromised,   undiscerning   Christian   leaders.  
They  are  calling evil good, and the counsel of a 
righteous  God  is  lightly  esteemed.  Hearts are 
hardening,  ears are closing, eyes are being shut-
because  pride and flesh and ungodly entertainment 
is  grieving  the  Holy  Spirit  right  out of His 
temple.

   Isaiah   warned,   '...their   root   shall  be 
rottenness,...because  they have cast away the law 
of  the  Lord  of  hosts, and despised the word of 
the  Holy  One  of Israel.  Therefore is the anger 
of   the   Lord  kindled  against  his  people...' 
[Isaiah 5:24-25].

   Hell  must  be  ecstatic  at  the  spectacle of 
ministers  not  just  abdicating  to  the  immoral 
music   standards   of   the   young-but  actually 
promoting.   Who  brings these worldly bent groups 
into  the church for concerts?  Who encourages the 
youth   to  embrace  the  music  of  devils?   Who 
ridicules  evangelists  and  prophets and watchmen 
who  cry  out  against  it?  Who puts it on radio, 
TV.  and  who  promotes the concerts and festivals 
that  are now degenerating into SATANIC SHOWCASES? 
It  is  the  pastors,  youth  ministers, Christian 
radio  and  TV. station owners and managers.  They 
will  all  live to see the wicked harvest of their 
soft  gospel  and  compromise-as  their  very  own 
children fall away to the spirit of this age.

   Webster's  Twentieth Century Dictionary defines 
whoredom  as  'the desertion of the worship of God 
for  the  worship  of idolatry'.  A whoremonger is 
ONE  WHO  PROCURES  OR PROMOTES IT.  Any spiritual 
leader  who  procures  or promotes this idolatrous 
desertion  of true worship is truly a WHOREMONGER. 
And  Paul state emphatically, 'No whoremonger, nor 
unclean  person,  nor  covetous  man,  who  is  an 
idolater,  hat  any  inheritance  in he kingdom of 
Christ of God.'  [Ephesians 5:5]

   Young  people-don't listen to the whoremongers-
listen  instead  to  the  apostle Paul-who warned, 
'Let  no  man  [even  preachers]  deceive you with 
vain  [empty]  words;  for because of these things 
cometh  the  wrath  of  God  upon  the children of 
disobedience.   BE YE NOT THEREFORE PARTAKERS WITH 
THEM'  {Ephesians 5:6-6}


**************************************************
                   Reprove Them!
**************************************************


'And  have no fellowship with the unfruitful works 
of darkness, but rather REPROVE THEM' [Eph. 5:11]

   All  spiritual  work  that  is tainted with the 
least   bit  of  darkness,  God  calls  UNFRUITFUL 
WORKS!   This  refutes  the  big  lie of the devil 
being  promoted  by  the pushers of the 'new wave' 
music,  which  argues,  'But  it  can't  be of the 
devil.   Look  at  all  the  kids  getting  saved!  
Listen   to  their  wonderful  testimonies.   They 
really  reach  the  youth-many  are getting saved.  
They  speak  in  a  way  the  kids understand-they 
glorify Christ in their speech.'

   God  never  has  judged  a work by the results.  
No  one  is  more  successful  in holding converts 
than  the  Muslims.   No church is richer than the 
Vatican.    The  Jehovah  Witnesses  claim  to  be 
winning multitudes to Christ.

   God  judges  everything  by LIGHT!  That means, 
by  how  godly,  how Christ-like-by how clear, how 
pure,  how  transparent  it is.  He repudiates and 
spits  out  of  His  mouth  all that has even been 
part  dark.  John saw the Holy City descending out 
of  the  heaven from God, having the glory of God.  
That  is  a  holy  people,  a  bride  adorned  and 
prepared    for    the   Bridegroom.    Its   main 
characteristic  is  this: 'Her light was like unto 
a  stone  most precious, even like a jasper stone, 
clear as crystal' [Revelation 21:11].

   Whatever  is of God is CLEAR AS CRYSTAL!  It is 
holiness  so  pure,  it  is  translucent  as  pure 
jasper  stone.   Those  who  are  numbered in this 
holy  Zion,  this  New  Jerusalem coming down from 
God-have  all  STEPPED  OUT INTO THE LIGHT!  There 
is  no  darkness  in  them  at  all-they have been 
translated  into  His  light!   They  walk  in the 
light-they  hate darkness-they reprove it wherever 
it  appears.   The  enemy  has come into religious 
circles  to  destroy  what  is  pure  and clear by 
introducing  a pagan element that creates a shadow 
or  film.   If  Satan  can  inject  the  slightest 
degree  of  error,  or  evil  leaven, he knows the 
Holy  Spirit will draw back because of a grieving. 
That  is why no mixture-no shadow of dark paganism 
must be permitted in Christ's church.

   Also,  the  Bible speaks of EVERY SEED YIELDING 
AFTER  ITS  OWN KIND [Genesis 1:12].  An evil seed 
produces  evil  fruit,  often not recognized until 
maturity.   The  rock  and roll "prophets" of this 
generation  are  yielding  a  seed after their own 
kind-a  seed that will one day bring forth a fruit 
that  will  wither  and die.  Jude makes that very 
clear,  '...these  feed  themselves  without fear: 
clouds  they  are  without water, carried about of 
winds;   trees   WHOSE  FRUIT  WITHERETH,  without 
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots."
[Jude 12].

   What  of  the  good  sounding  testimonies, the 
sincere  and convincing sermonettes?  Paul has the 
answer.   'Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye 
on  those  who  cause  dissensions  and HINDRANCES 
contrary  to  the  teaching which you learned, and 
TURN  AWAY  FROM  THEM...For  such men are slaves, 
not  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ but of THEIR OWN 
APPETITES;  and  BY  THEIR  SMOOTH  AND FLATTERING 
SPEECH    THEY   DECEIVE   THE   HEARTS   OF   THE 
UNSUSPECTING."  [Romans 16:17-18 NAS]

   Oh  how  God's  people need discernment.  Great 
deceptions  about  every where, not only regarding 
the  rock and punk music of the young, but also in 
regard  to  new  forms of worship and praise being 
promoted.   Some of it is born of the Holy Spirit, 
but  much  is born of the flesh-and only those who 
walk in the light know the difference.

   There  is a revival of worship and praise in he 
land    today,   and   much   focus   on   prayer, 
intercession  nd  new  revelation.   There  is  no 
question   about   there   being   more  and  more 
Christians  standing for an hour or two-with great 
congregations  singing and praising loudly.  There 
are  smiles, laugher, joy, hand clapping, upraised 
hands,  dancing-never  in  modern  times has there 
been a GREATER SHOUT IN THE CAMP.

   Thank  God for those in the camp who worship in 
Spirit  and truth-who can lift clean hands and who 
have  pure  hearts-who  come  before  His holiness 
with  broken  heart  and contrite spirit.  If they 
are  walking  in  holiness  ,  trembling  at God's 
Word,  repentant and free from the bondage of sin-
it  is a glorious and acceptable offering unto the 
Lord.  God does inhabit the praises of His people-
but  only if those people are walking in practical 
righteousness.

           But There Is a Shout Which is
             Shallow and Meaningless!

**************************************************

   There  is  the  shout  of the overcomer and the 
shout  of  the idolater-and we had better know the 
difference.   The Lord commanded Moses to 'Go, get 
thee  down;  for thy people, which thou broughtest 
out   of   the   land  of  Egypt,  have  corrupted 
themselves:  they have turned aside quickly out of 
the  way  which  I  commanded them: they have made 
them  a  molten  calf,  and  have  worshipped  it' 
[Exodus 32:7-8].

   As  Moses  and  Joshua  approached  the camp of 
Israel,  Joshua  'heard the noise of the people as 
they  shouted...'  [v  17].   But  it  was not the 
shout  of  those  who had overcome the enemy.  The 
true  shepherd  Moses,  having come fresh from the 
very   presence  of  God's  holiness-could  easily 
discern  that  the  GREAT  SHOUT  coming  from the 
Lord's  chosen  people was not pure.  Something as 
terribly  wrong-it did not ring of the holiness of 
God.

   Moses  said,  'It is not the voice of them that 
shout  form  mastery,  neither  is it the voice of 
them  that  cry  for being overcome: but the noise 
of them that sing do I hear'  [Exodus 32:18]

   That's  all it was, MEANINGLESS, SHALLOW NOISE-
but  an  abomination  in  the  ears of a holy God.  
They  had  no  right  to  sing;  their hearts were 
lusting  after  an  idol.  Their hearts were given 
to  pleasure  and fun.  They stood before a golden 
calf-and  it  the  name  of the Lord offered burnt 
offerings.   The people 'sat down to eat and drink 
and rose up to play..' [Exodus 32:6]

   I  received many letters from Christians whom I 
know  have  come  through  the  school  of Christ.  
They   have   come   through  much  suffering  and 
spiritual  warfare to a place in God where nothing 
else  matters  but  knowing Him in fullness.  They 
were  driven  by  such  deep  hunger for God, they 
began  to  thirst  for  Christ  as  'the hart that 
panteth  after  water'.   They  tell me how out of 
place  they  feel  in these great assemblies where 
the  shout  in  the camp goes forth.  It all looks 
good,  and  on  the surface sounds good.  But they 
can't  enter in, because they discern something is 
basically  wrong.   They can't even explain it-the 
Spirit  of  God  within  them  will  not  let them 
partake   of   it.   They  discern  some  kind  of 
unspeakable    darkness-something    subtle,   yet 
ominous  about  all the flesh that accompanies the 
singing,  shouting, and dancing.  It is almost too 
professional,   too  put  on,  too  carnal.   They 
leave,  thinking to themselves, 'Is it me-is there 
something  wrong  with  me?   Am I too judgmental?  
Why  am  I not comfortable amidst all this singing 
and dancing?

   Those  who  have STEPPED OUT INTO THE LIGHT can 
easily  discern the shadow of darkness.  They will 
not  be  fooled  by false shouting, false dancing, 
false worship, or false praying.

   True   Zion   saints  REJOICE  WITH  TREMBLING! 
{Psalm  2:11}   They  know  that  gladness belongs 
only  to  the  'upright  in  heart' [Psalm 97:11].  
They  can  sing  and  dance when t he Spirit moves 
them,  but  with  David they can say, 'Zion heard, 
and  was glad; and the daughters of Judah REJOICED 
BECAUSE  OF  THY JUDGEMENTS, O LORD' [Psalm 97:8].  
Zion  saints,  'GIVE  THANKS  TO  THE  LORD AT THE 
REMEMBRANCE OF HIS HOLINESS' [Psalm 97:12]

   No  punk  or  rock or phony shouting and praise 
for  those  walking in the light.  They praise Him 
for  both His goodness and because they tremble at 
His great and terrible name.

   'The  Lord  is  great  in  Zion; and he is high 
about    all    the    people...Let   the   people 
tremble...LET  THEM PRAISE THEY GREAT AND TERRIBLE 
NAME; FOR IT IS HOLY' [Psalm 99:1-3]

                      HOLY ROCK 'N' ROLLERS


    They  call  it  demon  rock  'n'  roll.   Many 
preachers   have  said  it  is  Satan's  tool  for 
catching  teens  off guard with a beat that drives 
them   into   a  sexual  frenzy.   Some  have  led 
crusades, burned albums and picketed concerts.

    They  are faced with one of the hottest trends 
in  music:  Christian  heavy-metal  and  hard-rock 
bands,  whose  voices and guitars screech and wail 
for  Jesus  Christ.   "All we heard for years from 
the  pulpit  was  how bad rock 'n' roll was," said 
Robert  Sweet,  25,  the  long-haired  drummer for 
Stryper,  a Christian band from Los Angeles, whose 
members  dress  in skintight black and yellow body 
suits  and  thick metal chains.    "Well, how many 
people  are  going  to  eat their words this year?  
God  created rock 'n' roll.  Satan cannot create - 
he  can  only  twist  and  distort  it and make it 
junk.   The  first  time  you catch Stryper with a 
beer  in  their  hands  or their faces in cocaine, 
then  you'll  have  a case.  But until then, we're 
innocent until proven guilty."

     Despite   a  nonstop  wave  of  protest  from 
ministers  and  parents,  Sweet's  group is one of 
more  than  100  Christian  rock  bands  that have 
sprung  up,  Taking  names  like  the Resurrection 
Band,  Barnabas,  Jerusalem  and Servant.  For the 
uninitiated,  retailers  like  Dickson's Bible and 
Book  Store  in  Royal Oak post a chart that lists  
each  group  and  compares  its sound to a secular 
group   such   as  the  Kinks,  Cheap  Trick,  Led 
Zeppelin  and  AC/DC.    But  lyrically  -  and in 
concert  -  the  Christian  and secular groups are 
worlds  apart.     "Feeling so distressed tonight, 
Jesus  are  you  there,  could  we  talk  a little 
while,   I  heard  you  really  care,"  sings  the  
Resurrection  Band  from  Chicago,  which ends its 
live  Bootleg  album  by urging fans to give their 
lives  to Jesus.  Other groups have an altar call, 
or  station  counselors  near  exits  to  talk  to 
troubled  teens.  Stryper members sing about their 
wild  appearance  -  "No  matter  how  we look, we 
always  praise  His name.  And if you you believe, 
you  got  to  do  the same" - and throw 100 to 200 
New  Testament  Bibles  out  to the crowd.    "One 
guy  was so anxious to get one," said Sweet, "that 
he broke his arm."

    Sue  Weldon, a 15-year-old from Troy, said she 
recently  brought her NON-CHRISTIAN friend to Pine 
Knob  to  hear  Petra,  the best selling Christian 
rock  group.    "She became a Christian at the end 
of  the  concert,"  said Sue, twisting a strand of 
her  permed  brown  hair.   "She went up to one of 
the  counselors  and has joined a church now.  She 
really  thought  it was great."    Stephen Wyss of 
Royal   Oak,  a  22-year-old  senior  at  Lawrence 
Institute   of   Technology,   said   he  owns  72 
Christian  music  albums.     "The main difference 
is  what  they sing about and their lifestyle," he 
said.  "When  Michael  Jackson was really popular, 
everyone  wanted to be like him.  Well, with these 
groups  getting  more  popular,  kids  can see how 
good  it  is to be a Christian, and they will have 
a  model to follow."    "You're not going to reach 
heavy  metal  people  with  pop  music.   You have 
different  types  of  evangelists because you have 
different types of people."

    Though  they  have  been  around  for about 10 
years,  most Christian rock groups have just begun 
to  take  off,  riding  on  the  powerful wings of 
Christian  contemporary  artists  like  Amy Grant, 
the   first   Christian   singer   to   appear  on 
"mainstream"  music  charts.   Ms.  Grant recently 
became  the best selling artist in Christian music 
history  when  her  last  two albums went gold ($1 
million   in  sales)  and  platinum  (one  million 
albums   sold).     Her  success  in  the  secular 
market  has  been followed by Petra - which is the 
Greek  word  for  rock  -  whose seven albums have 
outsold  all  other Christian rock groups combined 
with total sales of more than $1 million.

    Stryper,  a Los Angeles group which will  soon 
tour  the  nation,  recently  sold  40,000  of its 
newly   released  singles  in  one  day.   It  has 
already   received   advance   orders  for  nearly 
100,000  copies of its newest album, which has not 
even   been   released.     Such  figures  do  not 
compare   with   those  of  secular  artists  like 
Michael   Jackson   and   Prince.   But  they  are 
considered   phenomenal   by  industry  observers, 
because  major secular radio stations still refuse 
to   play   Christian  music,  citing  the  songs' 
emphasis  on evangelism.    "It's only been in the 
last  few  years that Christian hard rock has made 
any  inroads  into  the  mainstream  market," said 
Bob   Darden, who writes about Christian music for 
Billboard  magazine.     "That's because it's only 
been  in  the  last  few years that the caliber of 
the  music  has  caught  up with mainstream music.  
There's  no reason kids should see a bad Christian 
group  if  they  can see a good secular group.  So 
the  Christians have gotten better."    But Darden 
is  critical of the "bad, trite" lyrics by many of 
the  groups  who,  for  instance,  try to cram the 
story  of  the  resurrection  into  a three minute 
song.    And   John   Styll,   editor-in-chief  of 
Contemporary  Christian magazine, said many of the 
artists  have been content to copy the music style 
of  mainstream  artists  and  just  add  religious 
lyrics,  instead  of  forging new ground.  He also 
predicted  that  they  will never have the success 
enjoyed  by  the mainstream counter parts.   "It's 
not  in  the cards," Styll said.  "To most people, 
contemporary   Christian   music   is   about   as 
appealing  as  contemporary  Bahai  music. They'll 
just  think,  'Oh, that's for them.' The gospel is 
offensive  to  people.   It will never achieve the 
popularity  that  sin  does."     To Ministers who 
spend  a  lot  of time preaching about the dangers 
of  sin,  the  subject of rock music still draws a 
lot  of fire.  "It is a device of the devil," said 
the  Rev.  Samuel Peterson, pastor of Faith Temple 
Church  of God in Madison Heights.  "In my church, 
I  don't  allow it.  Unless the ear is educated to 
it,  you  can't  hear the lyrics. What good is the 
message  if  you  can't hear it?  And it grates on 
my  nerves,  whether  it's Christian or not.  It's 
like  having  someone  scream in my ear.  The beat 
is  very  physical,  driving  and  compelling.  It 
compels  your  nervous  system until it drowns out 
your  brain.   I  can't  find  a  better word than 
'torment.'"      But   the   Rev.   Paul   Patton, 
assistant  pastor  at  Trinity  Baptist  Church in 
Livonia,  encourages  young  people  to  listen to 
Christian  rock  music.     "If  anyone has an ear 
for  that  type  of  music,"  he said, "I'd prefer 
they  hear  lyrical  content that wasn't sexist or 
has  that  macho  mentality that is so much a part 
of  the  heavy  metal  scene.  They're reaching an 
audience  that  most of their critics know nothing 
about.  They  are  touching  lives and challenging 
values that people in mainstream music aren't."
     Stryper's   Robert  Sweet  said  the  group's 
success   (its   fan   club  has  10,000  members) 
indicates  it  can  stand  on its own from secular 
groups.  But,  he  said,  it  has  not  been easy.    
"It  takes  a  lot  of guts to be in rock 'n' roll 
and  stand up for Jesus," he said.  "What field of 
work  are  you  more  tempted  in?   Here  I am, a 
single  guy  who  has professed to TV stations and 
newspapers  that  I'm  saving myself for the right 
woman.   And  every time I play, I'm confronted by 
10  to  20  beautiful  women.  It's real tempting.  
And  we  can get all the free drugs and alcohol we 
want."     "But  the  more  you do God's work, the 
more  the  devil  tempts  you.   So  we  just pray 
harder.   Stryper  wants  to  walk  into  the most 
heavy-metal,  hard  rock,  drug  abusing, blinded-
eyes  kind  of situation and say, 'Look, this is a 
dark   room   and   the  light  is  walking  in.'"     
Among  the  500 to 600 fans who write Stryper each 
week  are  those  who  thank the group for helping 
them     overcome    struggles    with    alcohol, 
homosexuality  or  depression.     "We  tell  them 
don't thank us, thank Jesus,"  said Sweet, whose
mother   manages   the  band  and  whose  brother, 
Michael,  is  the  lead  singer.   "I remember one 
night,  a guy called me at 10 p.m. crying.  He was 
a  stranger,  but  I  felt  like I should go visit 
him.   He  was a 24-year-old guy dying of cerebral 
palsy.   He  had  Stryper  stickers  all  over his 
wheelchair."     "I  prayed  with him and he asked 
me  if  he could buy a Stryper jacket.  I had mine 
on  and  gave  it  to him.  When he got my jacket, 
tears  were  streaming  down  his face and he told 
his  mom,  'When  I  die,  I  want to be buried in 
this.   When  I  stand in front of God, I want him 
to  see  me  wearing something that's good, that's 
right.'"     "When those things happen, it lets us 
know that we're more than just a rock band."

               SUMMARY & CONCLUSION


Arise  now  and  put  away your idols!!  Call your 
brothers  and  sisters to repentance.  And if they 
will  not  repent  than  do  as scripture says and 
"have nothing to do with them".

Any  BBS  system  that  would  post  this  article 
without  a  refuting  it  for the whitewash it is, 
has  much  to  learn about what it means to follow 
Jesus.  Call them to repentance!

Let  there  be a holy division that takes place in 
the church.  Let Proverbs 29:27 be true.

       "The righteous detest the dishonest;
          the wicked detest the upright."
