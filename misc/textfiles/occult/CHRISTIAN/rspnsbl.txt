Title: On Christian Responsibility

@INTL 93:9609/0 93:9004/0
Having made an initial stab at defining the difference between Christian
Believers and Christian Faith-Holders, I would like to present my ideas
concerning the responsibilities of a Christian in a forum such as this
one.

First of all, all Christians are responsible to represent Christ as best
they are able to.  The success with which any of us manage to do this will
tend to vary.  Sometimes we will do it well; other times we will fail.

Secondly, all Christians should be able to be at least as civil, as open
minded, as cordial, and as supportive of others, as anyone on this echo.
Those who cannot achieve this, demonstrate the falsehood that Christianity
is an inferior religion, for ignorant fanatics.  This IS a falsehood, and
Christians who give this impression, disgrace their Lord by doing so.

Thirdly, Christians ought to have a sense of humor--after all, who in all
the earth is more ridiculous than we are?--but should never be mockers.
What is a mocker?  S/he is a person who makes jokes at the expense of
others, for no purpose except to poke fun at them.  If one has another
purpose, and IF that purpose is to teach the other person something that
everyone needs to know, then possibly that is not mockery; however, it is
borderline, and should be avoided when possible.

Fourthly, Christians should at all times remember that people are led
to Christ BY EXAMPLE, not by being harrangued by tract-wielding, Bible-
thumping loud-mouths!  On this echo, proselytizing is absolutely
forbidden, though it is always legitimate to answer another person's
questions.  But in other places, even though proselytizing may not be
forbidden in those other places, the Christian needs to realize that if
s/he has to convince people with words, s/he is NOT convincing them by
her/his own life, so something is drastically wrong.  When this is the
case, the Christian needs to stop preaching Christianity and start LIVING
Christianity.

Finally, the Christian's responsibility to non-Christians is NOT to "save"
them.  Only GOD can truly save people; no man or woman can save another
person.  True Faith-Holders will know that God is able to save whomever
He chooses, if they are not determined to destroy themselves.  So let God
do it--it's His job, not yours!

"So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows
mercy." (Romans 9:16)
