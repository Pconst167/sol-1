THE BOOK OF ALMA, The Son of Alma

ALM 0:0 The account of Alma, who was the son of Alma the first, and Chief Judge
over the people of Nephi, and also the High Priest over the Church. An account
of the reign of the Judges, and the wars and contentions among the people. And
also an account of a war between the Nephites and the Lamanites, according to
the record of Alma, the first and chief Judge.

ALM 1:0 Nehor, an enemy of the church, slays Gideon, and is brought to judgment
and executed--Priestcraft and persecution--Improved conditions--Priests and
people equal.

ALM 1:1 Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the
way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before
God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws,
and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide
by the laws which he had made.

ALM 1:2 And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the
judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was
large, and was noted for his much strength.

ALM 1:3 And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he
termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto
the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they
ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the
people.

ALM 1:4 And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved
at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might
lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also
redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.

ALM 1:5 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many
did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give
him money.

ALM 1:6 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear
very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner
of his preaching.

ALM 1:7 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on
his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of
their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead
away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with
the words of God.

ALM 1:8 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument
in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.

ALM 1:9 Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth
with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being
stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows,
therefore he was slain by the sword.

ALM 1:10 And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and
was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had
committed.

ALM 1:11 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for himself
with much boldness.

ALM 1:12 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that
priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not
only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and
were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire
destruction.

ALM 1:13 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has
done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would
come upon us for vengeance.

ALM 1:14 Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has
been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this
people; therefore this people must abide by the law.

ALM 1:15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and
they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or
rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had
taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an
ignominious death.

ALM 1:16 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft
through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world,
and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake
of riches and honor.

ALM 1:17 Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the
law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to
their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.

ALM 1:18 And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished;
neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto
death.

ALM 1:19 But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God
began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken
upon them the name of Christ.

ALM 1:20 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of
words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their
own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another,
without money and without price.

ALM 1:21 Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there
should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did
not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among
themselves.

ALM 1:22 Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and
began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they
would smite one another with their fists.

ALM 1:23 Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a
cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial
with the church.

ALM 1:24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted
out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God. And also many
withdrew themselves from among them.

ALM 1:25 Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith;
nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of
God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.

ALM 1:26 And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto
the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when
the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again
diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his
hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the
teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did
all labor, every man according to his strength.

ALM 1:27 And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that
which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and
they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.

ALM 1:28 And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they
began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.

ALM 1:29 And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be
exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in
need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also
abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and
abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.

ALM 1:30 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away
any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were
sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon
riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and
free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having
no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.

ALM 1:31 And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who
did not belong to their church.

ALM 1:32 For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in
sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and
strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes;
persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and
all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those
who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.

ALM 1:33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every
man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and
durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much
peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the
judges.

ALM 2:0 Amlici seeks to become king--Rejected by the majority, but is made
king--He is defeated in battle--He joins the Lamanites--Alma slays Amlici and
routs his forces.

ALM 2:1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of their
reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being
called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of
the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword,
who was executed according to the law--

ALM 2:2 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him;
even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to
establish Amlici to be a king over the people.

ALM 2:3 Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all
those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they
knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the
voice of the people.

ALM 2:4 Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the
people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and
privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.

ALM 2:5 And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together
throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for
or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful
contentions one with another.

ALM 2:6 And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices
concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.

ALM 2:7 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici,
that he was not made king over the people.

ALM 2:8 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against
him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those
who were not in his favor.

ALM 2:9 And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did
consecrate Amlici to be their king.

ALM 2:10 Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they
should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might
subject them to him.

ALM 2:11 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici,
being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people
of God.

ALM 2:12 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the
Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm
themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and
with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every
kind.

ALM 2:13 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their
coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief
captains, according to their numbers.

ALM 2:14 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of
weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his
people, to lead them to war against their brethren.

ALM 2:15 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu,
which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and
there they began to make war with the Nephites.

ALM 2:16 Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of
Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief
captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.

ALM 2:17 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon. And
the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that
many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.

ALM 2:18 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that
they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before
them.

ALM 2:19 And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all
that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain
of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there
were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.

ALM 2:20 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no
longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of
Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of
Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for
the night.

ALM 2:21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he
might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself
against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.

ALM 2:22 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were
called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out
with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.

ALM 2:23 And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of
the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much
fear, saying:

ALM 2:24 Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great
astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course
of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the
Amlicites have joined them;

ALM 2:25 And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing
before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our
city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our
fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.

ALM 2:26 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and
departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of
Zarahemla.

ALM 2:27 And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and
the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea,
came upon them to destroy them.

ALM 2:28 Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord,
having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of
their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen
them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.

ALM 2:29 And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face
to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.

ALM 2:30 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised
with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I
may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people.

ALM 2:31 Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and
he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.

ALM 2:32 And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of
the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with
Alma.

ALM 2:33 But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of
the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.

ALM 2:34 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the
west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been
slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to
cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the
river Sidon.

ALM 2:35 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon
that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding
they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.

ALM 2:36 And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was
west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did
pursue them with their might, and did slay them.

ALM 2:37 Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they
were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the
wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness
which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.

ALM 2:38 And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds,
and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their
bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.

ALM 3:0 The mark of the Amlicites, and the curse upon the Lamanites--Another
Nephite victory.

ALM 3:1 And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons
of war, after having buried those who had been slain--now the number of the
slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number--after they
had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their
houses, and their wives, and their children.

ALM 3:2 Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also
many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain
were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.

ALM 3:3 And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain
upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold
their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many.

ALM 3:4 And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had
marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the
Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.

ALM 3:5 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it
were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was
girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and
their slings, and so forth.

ALM 3:6 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which
was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their
transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of
Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.

ALM 3:7 And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed;
and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the
sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.

ALM 3:8 And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed
of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that
they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their
destruction.

ALM 3:9 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the
Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.

ALM 3:10 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites
was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.

ALM 3:11 And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition
of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land
of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct,
who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the
Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth--

ALM 3:12 And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their
people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.

ALM 3:13 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark
set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red
upon their foreheads.

ALM 3:14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he
said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on
them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from
this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and
turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.

ALM 3:15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy
brethren, that they may be cursed also.

ALM 3:16 And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and
thy seed.

ALM 3:17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called
thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed,
henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and
to his seed.

ALM 3:18 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God
when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had
come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the
curse should fall upon them.

ALM 3:19 Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the
curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own
condemnation.

ALM 3:20 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was
fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there
was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same
place where the first army met the Amlicites.

ALM 3:21 And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of
their land.

ALM 3:22 Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle
at this time against the Lamanites;

ALM 3:23 But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew
many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of
their land.

ALM 3:24 And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land,
being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.

ALM 3:25 Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions
were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 3:26 And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to
the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works,
whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or
eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it
be a good spirit or a bad one.

ALM 3:27 For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this
according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according
to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 4:0 Growth of the church--Prosperity, pride, and iniquity--Nephihah made
chief judge.

ALM 4:1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of
Zarahemla;

ALM 4:2 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of
their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for
the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed
by the Lamanites.

ALM 4:3 And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn;
and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of
their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a
remembrance of their duty.

ALM 4:4 And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were
baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they
were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest
over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.

ALM 4:5 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges
there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to
the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the
reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in
all that time.

ALM 4:6 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the judges, that
the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches,
and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many
flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious
things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were
they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly
apparel.

ALM 4:7 Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of
the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders
over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which
they saw had begun to be among their people.

ALM 4:8 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church
began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon
riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful,
one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe
according to their own will and pleasure.

ALM 4:9 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began
to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were
envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed
the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.

ALM 4:10 And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the
wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not
belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.

ALM 4:11 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw
the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church
began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to
another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.

ALM 4:12 Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves
up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and
the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who
were sick and afflicted.

ALM 4:13 Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while
others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their
succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding
the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ's sake, who
should come according to the spirit of prophecy;

ALM 4:14 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins;
being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according
to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.

ALM 4:15 And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the
humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by
the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very
sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.

ALM 4:16 And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and
gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power
to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in
force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.

ALM 4:17 Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge;
and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.

ALM 4:18 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over
the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he
delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.

ALM 4:19 And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or
among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to
stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the
word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were
among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in
bearing down in pure testimony against them.

ALM 4:20 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to
Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order
of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and
prophecy.

ALM 5:0 The words which Alma, the High Priest according to the holy order of
God, delivered to the people in their cities and villages throughout the
land--He recounts the experience of the church--Denounces iniquity--Calls upon
the people to repent.

ALM 5:1 Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the
people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the
land.

ALM 5:2 And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church
which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record,
saying:

ALM 5:3 I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high
priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do
these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the
land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land
of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.

ALM 5:4 And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the
people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.

ALM 5:5 And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of
the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity,
and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word;
and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church
of God throughout this land also.

ALM 5:6 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this
church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your
fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and
long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in
remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?

ALM 5:7 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep
sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness;
nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting
word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of
hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.

ALM 5:8 And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I say
unto you, Nay, they were not.

ALM 5:9 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell
which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were
loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say
unto you that they are saved.

ALM 5:10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what
grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed
from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?

ALM 5:11 Behold, I can tell you--did not my father Alma believe in the words
which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet?
Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?

ALM 5:12 And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his
heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.

ALM 5:13 And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty
change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put
their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until
the end; therefore they were saved.

ALM 5:14 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye
spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?
Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?

ALM 5:15 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you
look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in
immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to
be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?

ALM 5:16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear the voice
of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me ye blessed, for behold,
your works have been the works of righteousness upon the face of the earth?

ALM 5:17 Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord in that
day, and say--Lord, our works have been righteous works upon the face of the
earth--and that he will save you?

ALM 5:18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the tribunal of
God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse, having a remembrance of all
your guilt, yea, a perfect remembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a
remembrance that ye have set at defiance the commandments of God?

ALM 5:19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure heart
and clean hands? I say unto you, can you look up, having the image of God
engraven upon your countenances?

ALM 5:20 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have yielded
yourselves to become subjects to the devil?

ALM 5:21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for
there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his
garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the
blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to
redeem his people from their sins.

ALM 5:22 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel, if ye
shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments stained with blood and
all manner of filthiness? Behold, what will these things testify against you?

ALM 5:23 Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and also that
ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?

ALM 5:24 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have a place
to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob,
and also all the holy prophets, whose garments are cleansed and are spotless,
pure and white?

ALM 5:25 I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the
beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose
that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out
for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.

ALM 5:26 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a
change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I
would ask, can ye feel so now?

ALM 5:27 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say,
if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been
sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white
through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their
sins?

ALM 5:28 Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are
not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of
heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.

ALM 5:29 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of envy? I
say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I would that he should
prepare quickly, for the hour is close at hand, and he knoweth not when the
time shall come; for such an one is not found guiltless.

ALM 5:30 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth make a mock
of his brother, or that heapeth upon him persecutions?

ALM 5:31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is at hand
that he must repent or he cannot be saved!

ALM 5:32 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent, for the
Lord God hath spoken it!

ALM 5:33 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms of mercy
are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I will receive you.

ALM 5:34 Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit of the
tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and the waters of life
freely;

ALM 5:35 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and ye shall
not be hewn down and cast into the fire--

ALM 5:36 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth not good
fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of righteousness, the same have cause
to wail and mourn.

ALM 5:37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of
the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness
nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a
shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not
hearken unto his voice!

ALM 5:38 Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and
in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will
not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are
called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.

ALM 5:39 And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are
ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his
fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth
this is a liar and a child of the devil.

ALM 5:40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and
whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.

ALM 5:41 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the
voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth
forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth
unto his voice, and doth follow him.

ALM 5:42 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him; therefore, for
his wages he receiveth death, as to things pertaining unto righteousness, being
dead unto all good works.

ALM 5:43 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in
the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye
cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.

ALM 5:44 For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy
order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and
testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers
concerning the things which are to come.

ALM 5:45 And this is not all. Do ye not suppose that I know of these things
myself? Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that these things whereof I
have spoken are true. And how do ye suppose that I know of their surety?

ALM 5:46 Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit
of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these
things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord
God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit
of revelation which is in me.

ALM 5:47 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed unto me,
that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are true, even so
according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me, which is also by the
manifestation of the Spirit of God.

ALM 5:48 I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall say unto
you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I say unto you, that I know
that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father,
full of grace, and mercy, and truth. And behold, it is he that cometh to take
away the sins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly
believeth on his name.

ALM 5:49 And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called,
yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in
the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea,
I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation;
yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.

ALM 5:50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth, for the
kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God cometh in his glory, in
his might, majesty, power, and dominion. Yea, my beloved brethren, I say unto
you, that the Spirit saith: Behold the glory of the King of all the earth; and
also the King of heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of
men.

ALM 5:51 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a mighty
voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people--Repent, for except ye repent
ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of heaven.

ALM 5:52 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at
the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit
shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be
consumed, even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath
spoken it.

ALM 5:53 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand these
sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample the Holy One under
your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the pride of your hearts; yea, will ye
still persist in the wearing of costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the
vain things of the world, upon your riches?

ALM 5:54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than another;
yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your brethren, who humble themselves
and do walk after the holy order of God, wherewith they have been brought into
this church, having been sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth
works which are meet for repentance--

ALM 5:55 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the poor, and the
needy, and in withholding your substance from them?

ALM 5:56 And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I say unto
you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast into the fire except
they speedily repent.

ALM 5:57 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow the voice
of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and be ye separate, and
touch not their unclean things; and behold, their names shall be blotted out,
that the names of the wicked shall not be numbered among the names of the
righteous, that the word of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the
wicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;

ALM 5:58 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life,
and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my
brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against
it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.

ALM 5:59 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch
over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a
wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he
can, he will destroy him.

ALM 5:60 And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and
if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are
his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among
you, that ye may not be destroyed.

ALM 5:61 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath
commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.

ALM 5:62 I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto
those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying:
Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the
fruit of the tree of life.

ALM 6:0 The reform movement, begun in Zarahemla, is carried to the city of
Gideon.

ALM 6:1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking
unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla,
he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order
of God, to preside and watch over the church.

ALM 6:2 And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who
repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into
the church.

ALM 6:3 And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that
did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God--I mean
those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts--the same were rejected,
and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among
those of the righteous.

ALM 6:4 And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of
Zarahemla.

ALM 6:5 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal
unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves
together to hear the word of God.

ALM 6:6 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather
themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the
welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.

ALM 6:7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he
departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla,
and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon,
there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was
in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain
by the hand of Nehor with the sword.

ALM 6:8 And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church
which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of
the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to
the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus
Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins,
and the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.

ALM 7:0 The words of Alma which he delivered to the people in Gideon, according
to his own record--His testimony of the Redeemer--he commends the people for
their righteousness.

ALM 7:1 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come
unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own
mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the
words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having
had much business that I could not come unto you.

ALM 7:2 And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the
judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in
much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.

ALM 7:3 And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I
should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had
continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were
blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma
that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.

ALM 7:4 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea,
hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are
established again in the way of his righteousness.

ALM 7:5 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I
shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you
should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for
the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading
through much affliction and sorrow.

ALM 7:6 But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as
were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your
hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain
things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do
worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission
of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.

ALM 7:7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold,
there is one thing which is of more importance than they all--for behold, the
time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.

ALM 7:8 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his
dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me
that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much
I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to
his word.

ALM 7:9 But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto
this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in
his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand,
and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.

ALM 7:10 And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land
of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall
be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a
son, yea, even the Son of God.

ALM 7:11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations
of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will
take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

ALM 7:12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death
which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his
bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know
according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.

ALM 7:13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God
suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his
people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of
his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.

ALM 7:14 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the
Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven;
therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your
sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of
the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.

ALM 7:15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which
easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and
go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and
enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto
him this day by going into the waters of baptism.

ALM 7:16 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from
thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember
that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the
testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.

ALM 7:17 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Behold, I
say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye
believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me. And now
because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which
I have spoken, great is my joy.

ALM 7:18 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that
ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found
that my desires have been gratified.

ALM 7:19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive
that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that
ye are making his paths straight.

ALM 7:20 I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of
his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that
which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the
left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course
is one eternal round.

ALM 7:21 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or
anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say
unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who
is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.

ALM 7:22 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I
might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless
before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have
been received.

ALM 7:23 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and
gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being
temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at
all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and
temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.

ALM 7:24 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always
abound in good works.

ALM 7:25 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye
may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy
prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments
spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no
more out.

ALM 7:26 And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you
according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly
rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto
my word.

ALM 7:27 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and
lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and
your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and
forever. And thus I have spoken. Amen.

ALM 8:0 Alma's success in Melek--The people of Ammonihah cast him
out--Comforted by an angel, he returns--Amulek joins him in the ministry--Great
power given.

ALM 8:1 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon,
after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written,
having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in
the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest
himself from the labors which he had performed.

ALM 8:2 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

ALM 8:3 And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of the reign
of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took
his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the
west by the borders of the wilderness.

ALM 8:4 And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the
holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the
people throughout all the land of Melek.

ALM 8:5 And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the
borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized
throughout all the land;

ALM 8:6 So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and
traveled three days' journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to
a city which was called Ammonihah.

ALM 8:7 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and
their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the
name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of
Ammonihah.

ALM 8:8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he
began to preach the word of God unto them.

ALM 8:9 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the
city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.

ALM 8:10 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in
mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in
the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.

ALM 8:11 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we
know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church
which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your
tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish
traditions.

ALM 8:12 And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that
thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto
Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.

ALM 8:13 Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and
reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their
city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called
Aaron.

ALM 8:14 And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being
weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul,
because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it
came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of
the Lord appeared unto him, saying:

ALM 8:15 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for
thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the
commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from
him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.

ALM 8:16 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of
Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them.
Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.

ALM 8:17 For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the
liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the
statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.

ALM 8:18 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the
angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he entered
the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of
Ammonihah.

ALM 8:19 And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man:
Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?

ALM 8:20 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a
holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou
shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee
of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.

ALM 8:21 And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the
man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.

ALM 8:22 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed
Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.

ALM 8:23 And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma,
and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.

ALM 8:24 And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all
this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in
this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about
to set my back towards this land forever.

ALM 8:25 But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and
prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their
iniquities.

ALM 8:26 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art
blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.

ALM 8:27 And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto
the people.

ALM 8:28 And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their
iniquities.

ALM 8:29 And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant
Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying--Repent ye, for thus
saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea,
and I will not turn my fierce anger away.

ALM 8:30 And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the
words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.

ALM 8:31 And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be
confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them;
nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands
and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his
power in them.

ALM 8:32 And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to
prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had
given them.

ALM 9:00 The words of Alma, and also the words of Amulek, which were declared
unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah. And also they are cast into
prison, and delivered by the miraculous power of God which was in them,
according to the record of Alma. Comprising chapters 9 to 14 inclusive.

ALM 9:0 Alma preaches to the people of Ammonihah and calls them to
repentance--His testimony rejected.

ALM 9:1 And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take
Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were
in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they
began to contend with me, saying:

ALM 9:2 Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one
man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?

ALM 9:3 Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not
that the earth should pass away.

ALM 9:4 And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst
prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.

ALM 9:5 Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were
a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.

ALM 9:6 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man
among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous
things?

ALM 9:7 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did
not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify
unto them, saying:

ALM 9:8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the
tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of
God.

ALM 9:9 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem
by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through
the wilderness?

ALM 9:10 And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers
out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed,
even by the hands of their own brethren?

ALM 9:11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy,
and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from
the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been
consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.

ALM 9:12 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and
except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this
is not all--he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from
off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his
fierce anger he will not turn away.

ALM 9:13 Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying
that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land?
And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye
shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.

ALM 9:14 Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites
have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence
of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this
thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the
beginning of their transgressions in the land.

ALM 9:15 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them
in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even
more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.

ALM 9:16 For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for
it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in
their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and
prolong their existence in the land.

ALM 9:17 And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his
word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and
many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on
his name.

ALM 9:18 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that
your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent
upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and
ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the
fierce anger of the Lord.

ALM 9:19 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to
destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the
Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if
it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after
having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord
their God;

ALM 9:20 Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea,
after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people;
after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires,
and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which
is to come;

ALM 9:21 Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with
angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the
spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift
of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy
Ghost, and the gift of translation;

ALM 9:22 Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of
Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from
sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed
strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of
bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they
have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things--

ALM 9:23 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received
so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the
light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the
case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more
tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.

ALM 9:24 For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites,
but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly
promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall
utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?

ALM 9:25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has
sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must
go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom
of heaven is nigh at hand;

ALM 9:26 And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and
his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace,
equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear
the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.

ALM 9:27 And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto
repentance, through faith on his name.

ALM 9:28 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand
that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they
have been--if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their
souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have
been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power
and captivation of the devil.

ALM 9:29 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.

ALM 9:30 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to
be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance,
seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and
seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.

ALM 9:31 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold,
the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a
hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.

ALM 9:32 And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen
people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that
they might cast me into prison.

ALM 9:33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should
take me at that time and cast me into prison.

ALM 9:34 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to
preach unto them also. And now the words of Amulek are not all written,
nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.

ALM 10:0 Amulek's lineage--Lehi a descendant of Joseph through Manasseh--Amulek
tells of his conversion--His testimony--He denounces designing lawyers and
judges--Zeezrom.

ALM 10:1 Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were
in the land of Ammonihah, saying:

ALM 10:2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who
was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the
writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger
of God.

ALM 10:3 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who
came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was
the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.

ALM 10:4 And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who
know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also
acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.

ALM 10:5 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of
the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much
of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries
and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this
people.

ALM 10:6 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I
would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know;
therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even
until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the
reign of the judges.

ALM 10:7 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the
Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou
shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God;
for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an
hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall
bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and
thy house.

ALM 10:8 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned
towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel
said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house--and behold it was this same
man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.

ALM 10:9 And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a
holy man because it was said by an angel of God.

ALM 10:10 And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true;
for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his
angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this
Alma hath dwelt at my house.

ALM 10:11 For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my
women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred
hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to
the words which he spake.

ALM 10:12 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be
astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things
whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according
to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.

ALM 10:13 Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question
them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that
they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their
judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be
slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear
or witness against them.

ALM 10:14 Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers,
who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times
of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.

ALM 10:15 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the
people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their
profession.

ALM 10:16 And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby
they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should
speak.

ALM 10:17 Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it
came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he
said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites,
for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and
snares to catch the holy ones of God.

ALM 10:18 Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to
bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of
this people.

ALM 10:19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to
deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this
people should be governed by their own voices--yea, well did he say that if the
time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is,
if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they
would be ripe for destruction.

ALM 10:20 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your
iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels:
Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

ALM 10:21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come
down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.

ALM 10:22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the
righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with
utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days
of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.

ALM 10:23 But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now
therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the
Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then
ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the
time is soon at hand except ye repent.

ALM 10:24 And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek,
and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are
just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.

ALM 10:25 But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto
them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such
great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may
have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words
which are spoken, according to their truth?

ALM 10:26 For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand;
ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken
in favor of your law, to your condemnation.

ALM 10:27 And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the
destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of
your lawyers and your judges.

ALM 10:28 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the
people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of
the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And
now he says that he has not spoken against it.

ALM 10:29 And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.

ALM 10:30 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that
they should remember these things against him.

ALM 10:31 And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the
foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them,
having much business to do among the people.

ALM 10:32 Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain
according to their employ.

ALM 11:0 Judges and their compensation--Nephite coins and measures--Zeezrom
confounded by Amulek.

ALM 11:1 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the
law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according
to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to
be judged.

ALM 11:2 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe,
he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent
forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man
according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus
the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out
from among the people as a thief and a robber.

ALM 11:3 And the judge received for his wages according to his time--a senine
of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold;
and this is according to the law which was given.

ALM 11:4 Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of
their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the
Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at
Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they
altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the
circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the
judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.

ALM 11:5 Now the reckoning is thus--a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of
gold, and a limnah of gold.

ALM 11:6 A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti
of silver.

ALM 11:7 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a
measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.

ALM 11:8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.

ALM 11:9 And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.

ALM 11:10 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.

ALM 11:11 And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.

ALM 11:12 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.

ALM 11:13 And an onti was as great as them all.

ALM 11:14 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning--

ALM 11:15 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure
of barley.

ALM 11:16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.

ALM 11:17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.

ALM 11:18 Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.

ALM 11:19 Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.

ALM 11:20 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received
their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people
to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might
have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were
brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and
Amulek.

ALM 11:21 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me
a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in
the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore,
he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?

ALM 11:22 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of
the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the
Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of
silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a
Supreme Being.

ALM 11:23 Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest thou
that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?

ALM 11:24 Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou
knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.

ALM 11:25 And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto
me--Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto
thee--when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only
thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have
cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy
reward.

ALM 11:26 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living
God?

ALM 11:27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.

ALM 11:28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?

ALM 11:29 And he answered, No.

ALM 11:30 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?

ALM 11:31 And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.

ALM 11:32 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of
God?

ALM 11:33 And he said unto him, Yea.

ALM 11:34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And
Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is
impossible for him to deny his word.

ALM 11:35 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things;
for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come,
but he shall not save his people--as though he had authority to command God.

ALM 11:36 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou
sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he
shall not save his people in their sins.

ALM 11:37 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for
I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the
kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the
kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.

ALM 11:38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal
Father?

ALM 11:39 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of
heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and
the end, the first and the last;

ALM 11:40 And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall
take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these
are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.

ALM 11:41 Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption
made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day
cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged
according to their works.

ALM 11:42 Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death
of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be
raised from this temporal death.

ALM 11:43 The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form;
both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are
at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we
know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.

ALM 11:44 Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both
bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and
even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing
shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall
be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the
Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according
to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.

ALM 11:45 Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the
mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say
unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from
death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their
spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming
spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.

ALM 11:46 Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to
be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of
Amulek, or this is all that I have written.

ALM 12:0 Amulek's testimony confirmed by Alma--Doctrine of the tree of
life--The plan of redemption expounded.

ALM 12:1 Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he
beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him,
and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he
opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of
Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that
which Amulek had done.

ALM 12:2 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people
round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:

ALM 12:3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and
craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God;
for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are
made known unto us by his Spirit;

ALM 12:4 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as
to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou
mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out--

ALM 12:5 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his
power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I
say unto all.

ALM 12:6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary,
which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection
unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain
you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.

ALM 12:7 Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more
exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was
also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was
convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was
given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of
prophecy.

ALM 12:8 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know
more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean
which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all
shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to
stand before God to be judged according to their works?

ALM 12:9 And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is
given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under
a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of
his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed
and diligence which they give unto him.

ALM 12:10 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the
lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is
given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the
mysteries of God until he know them in full.

ALM 12:11 And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser
portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then
they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction.
Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.

ALM 12:12 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised
from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar
of God, to be judged according to our works.

ALM 12:13 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our
hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will
our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.

ALM 12:14 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we
shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this
awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad
if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from
his presence.

ALM 12:15 But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his
glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and
acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he
is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and
that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth
forth fruit meet for repentance.

ALM 12:16 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second
death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his
sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall
die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.

ALM 12:17 Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and
brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that
they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the
power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.

ALM 12:18 Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no
redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God's justice; and
they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.

ALM 12:19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these
words, the people began to be more astonished;

ALM 12:20 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came
forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise
from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the
soul can never die?

ALM 12:21 What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim
and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents
should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever?
And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live
forever.

ALM 12:22 Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to
explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit,
according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind
became a lost and fallen people.

ALM 12:23 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam
to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would
have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for
he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.

ALM 12:24 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has
been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a
space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a
probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that
endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection
of the dead.

ALM 12:25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid
from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the
dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the
resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.

ALM 12:26 And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have
gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever
miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would
have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none
effect.

ALM 12:27 But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they
must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment
of which we have spoken, which is the end.

ALM 12:28 And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man,
behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the
things whereof he had appointed unto them;

ALM 12:29 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to
behold of his glory.

ALM 12:30 And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore
God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which
had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto
them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.

ALM 12:31 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first
transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and
becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act,
or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures,
whether to do evil or to do good--

ALM 12:32 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known
unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty
thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things
pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no
power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the
supreme goodness of God.

ALM 12:33 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan
of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your
hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;

ALM 12:34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall
have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his
sins; and these shall enter into my rest.

ALM 12:35 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I
swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.

ALM 12:36 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden
your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your
iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first
provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the
first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to
his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.

ALM 12:37 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true,
let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God
to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has
given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared
according to his word.

ALM 13:0 Alma's discourse continued--The holy order of the Son of God--High
Priests--Why ordained--Melchizedek and Abraham.

ALM 13:1 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time
when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that
ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order,
which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.

ALM 13:2 And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a
manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his
Son for redemption.

ALM 13:3 And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being called
and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of
God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place
being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and
exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with
that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory
redemption for such.

ALM 13:4 And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of
their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the
hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not
been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.

ALM 13:5 Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with
their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of
the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the
atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared--

ALM 13:6 And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high
priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the
children of men, that they also might enter into his rest--

ALM 13:7 This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was
from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of
days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according
to his foreknowledge of all things--

ALM 13:8 Now they were ordained after this manner--being called with a holy
calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high
priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high
priesthood, is without beginning or end--

ALM 13:9 Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the
Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years,
who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen.

ALM 13:10 Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood,
there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on
account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before
God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;

ALM 13:11 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were
sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.

ALM 13:12 Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their
garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon
sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many,
who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.

ALM 13:13 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before
God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into
that rest.

ALM 13:14 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek,
who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also
took upon him the high priesthood forever.

ALM 13:15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea,
even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.

ALM 13:16 Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the
people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or
it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a
remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.

ALM 13:17 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his
people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone
astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;

ALM 13:18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the
office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach
repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did
establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of
peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.

ALM 13:19 Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards,
but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made
mention.

ALM 13:20 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice.
Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to
your own destruction.

ALM 13:21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto
them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice,
saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh;

ALM 13:22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare
it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of
great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea,
even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore
they have come unto us.

ALM 13:23 And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may
understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a
strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad
tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.

ALM 13:24 For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our
land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of
men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.

ALM 13:25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the
mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon.
Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I
will rejoice.

ALM 13:26 And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the mouth of
angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be
fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was
according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.

ALM 13:27 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea,
with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and
cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;

ALM 13:28 But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his
holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above
that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble,
meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;

ALM 13:29 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal
life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at
the last day and enter into his rest.

ALM 13:30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring
down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell,
that ye may not suffer the second death.

ALM 13:31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written
in this book.

ALM 14:0 Alma and Amulek imprisoned--their adherents persecuted--Deaths by
fire--Zeezrom, now repentant, pleads their cause and is cast out--The prophets
delivered and their enemies slain.

ALM 14:1 And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the
people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to
search the scriptures.

ALM 14:2 But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma
and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his
words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had lied unto them, and had
reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.

ALM 14:3 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had
testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to put them away
privily.

ALM 14:4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound
them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.

ALM 14:5 And the people went forth and witnessed against them--testifying that
they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and
also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was
but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should
not save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and
Amulek. Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.

ALM 14:6 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had
been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he
had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be
harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be
encircled about by the pains of hell.

ALM 14:7 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying:
Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God. And he began to
plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou
also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and cast him out from
among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken
by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at
them.

ALM 14:8 And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever
believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they
should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which
contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they
might be burned and destroyed by fire.

ALM 14:9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them
forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of
those who were consumed by fire.

ALM 14:10 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were
consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we
witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and
exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.

ALM 14:11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not
stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in
glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may
do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the
judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the
blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry
mightily against them at the last day.

ALM 14:12 Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also.

ALM 14:13 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But, behold,
our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.

ALM 14:14 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast
into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them,
the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were
bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them:
After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall
be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?

ALM 14:15 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast
into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith. And
the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for
yourselves?

ALM 14:16 Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew
Gideon.

ALM 14:17 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he
smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.

ALM 14:18 And when they had been cast into prison three days, there came many
lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who were of the profession of
Nehor; and they came in unto the prison to see them, and they questioned them
about many words; but they answered them nothing.

ALM 14:19 And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why
do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to
deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they
answered nothing.

ALM 14:20 And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came
again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And
many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge
this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not
deliver yourselves?

ALM 14:21 And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth
upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are
damned?

ALM 14:22 And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say
unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did withhold
food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and
they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they
were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.

ALM 14:23 And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and
it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the tenth year of the reign
of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of
Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison
where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.

ALM 14:24 And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said
unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and
then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your
words.

ALM 14:25 And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying
the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the
power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.

ALM 14:26 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great
afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is
in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were
bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of
destruction had come upon them.

ALM 14:27 And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to
the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook
mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to
the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who
smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.

ALM 14:28 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not
hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which
was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were
loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul
within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they
straightway came forth into the city.

ALM 14:29 Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by
multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming
forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they
were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even
as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the
presence of Alma and Amulek.

ALM 15:0 Zeezrom, miraculously healed, joins the church and preaches--Many
baptized--Alma and Amulek return to Zarahemla.

ALM 15:1 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to depart out
of that city; and they departed, and came out even into the land of Sidom; and
behold, there they found all the people who had departed out of the land of
Ammonihah, who had been cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words
of Alma.

ALM 15:2 And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives and
children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance.

ALM 15:3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was
caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for
he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had
been slain because of his iniquity. And this great sin, and his many other
sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no
deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.

ALM 15:4 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his
heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them,
desiring them to come unto him.

ALM 15:5 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the message
which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the house unto Zeezrom; and
they found him upon his bed, sick, being very low with a burning fever; and his
mind also was exceedingly sore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them
he stretched forth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.

ALM 15:6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand:
Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?

ALM 15:7 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that thou hast
taught.

ALM 15:8 And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ thou
canst be healed.

ALM 15:9 And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.

ALM 15:10 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God, have mercy
on this man, and heal him according to his faith which is in Christ.

ALM 15:11 And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his feet, and
began to walk; and this was done to the great astonishment of all the people;
and the knowledge of this went forth throughout all the land of Sidom.

ALM 15:12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time
forth to preach unto the people.

ALM 15:13 And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated
priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were
desirous to be baptized.

ALM 15:14 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock in from
all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.

ALM 15:15 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet
remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of
their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they
were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their
sins.

ALM 15:16 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all
his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of
Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his
friends and also by his father and his kindred;

ALM 15:17 Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing
a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of
their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble
themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar,
watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and
from death, and from destruction--

ALM 15:18 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took
Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house,
and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the
Lord.

ALM 15:19 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

ALM 16:0 A cry of war--The wicked city Ammonihah destroyed by Lamanites--Zoram
and his sons rout the enemy--Desolation of Nehors--The church widely
established.

ALM 16:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second month, there having
been much peace in the land of Zarahemla, there having been no wars nor
contentions for a certain number of years, even until the fifth day of the
second month in the eleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the
land.

ALM 16:2 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the
wilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city of Ammonihah,
and began to slay the people and destroy the city.

ALM 16:3 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient
army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people who were in
the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken
others captive into the wilderness.

ALM 16:4 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain those
who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.

ALM 16:5 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the armies of
the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two sons, Lehi and Aha)--now
Zoram and his two sons, knowing that Alma was high priest over the church, and
having heard that he had the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him
and desired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go into the
wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been taken captive by the
Lamanites.

ALM 16:6 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning the
matter. And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the Lamanites will cross
the river Sidon in the south wilderness, away up beyond the borders of the land
of Manti. And behold there shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon,
and there the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been taken
captive by the Lamanites.

ALM 16:7 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the river
Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the borders of Manti into the
south wilderness, which was on the east side of the river Sidon.

ALM 16:8 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the Lamanites were
scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they took their brethren who had
been taken captive by the Lamanites, and there was not one soul of them had
been lost that were taken captive. And they were brought by their brethren to
possess their own lands.

ALM 16:9 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having
been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea,
every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed, and also their great
city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.

ALM 16:10 But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the carcasses were
mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.

ALM 16:11 Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped up upon
the face of the earth, and they were covered with a shallow covering. And now
so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the
land of Ammonihah for many years. And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for
they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained
desolate.

ALM 16:12 And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites
until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all
the land.

ALM 16:13 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in
their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which
were built after the manner of the Jews.

ALM 16:14 And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the
word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.

ALM 16:15 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had
been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land. And the
establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the
region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.

ALM 16:16 And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his
Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men,
or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among
them at the time of his coming--

ALM 16:17 That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not
be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word
with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter
into the rest of the Lord their God.

ALM 16:18 Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach
against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and
revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery,
and all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be--

ALM 16:19 Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the
coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection
of the dead.

ALM 16:20 And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son
of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after
his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.

ALM 16:21 And now after the church had been established throughout all the
land--having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached
in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the
people--thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

ALM 17:00 An account of the sons of Mosiah, who rejected their rights to the
kingdom for the word of God, and went up to the land of Nephi to preach to the
Lamanites; their sufferings and deliverance--according to the record of Alma.
Comprising chapters 17 to 26 inclusive.

ALM 17:0 Ammon in the land of Ishmael--he becomes a servant to king Lamoni--His
heroic defense of the king's flocks.

ALM 17:1 And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of
Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he
met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.

ALM 17:2 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first
appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren;
and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea,
and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a
sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they
might know the word of God.

ALM 17:3 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and
fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of
revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.

ALM 17:4 And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen
years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the
knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought
before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.

ALM 17:5 Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their
journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body
and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the
spirit.

ALM 17:6 Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father,
Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused the kingdom which their
father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the
people;

ALM 17:7 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took
their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their
slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while in
the wilderness.

ALM 17:8 And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which
they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God
unto the Lamanites.

ALM 17:9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness,
and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a
portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be
an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their
brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the
baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.

ALM 17:10 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and
said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted.

ALM 17:11 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy
brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and
afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will
make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.

ALM 17:12 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also
those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to
declare unto them the word of God.

ALM 17:13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land
of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another,
trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest;
for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.

ALM 17:14 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the
word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who
delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their
hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet
they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might
not labor for them with their own hands.

ALM 17:15 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship
idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of
their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them
on the conditions of repentance.

ALM 17:16 Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had
undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that
perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.

ALM 17:17 Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth
among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was
given unto him.

ALM 17:18 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer
unto them, and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to
their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or
administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several
journeys throughout the land.

ALM 17:19 And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after
the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.

ALM 17:20 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and
bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their
hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of
the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into
prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.

ALM 17:21 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of
Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.

ALM 17:22 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the
land among the Lamanites, or among his people.

ALM 17:23 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for
a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.

ALM 17:24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and
caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one
of his daughters to wife.

ALM 17:25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore
Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set
among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of
the Lamanites.

ALM 17:26 And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he
was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of
water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their
flocks hither, that they may have water--

ALM 17:27 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth
their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites,
who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of
Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they
fled many ways.

ALM 17:28 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king
will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the
wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold,
our flocks are scattered already.

ALM 17:29 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw
this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth
my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in
restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my
fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.

ALM 17:30 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the
afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.

ALM 17:31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My
brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will
gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we
will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.

ALM 17:32 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they
did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the
flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.

ALM 17:33 And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said
unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go
and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.

ALM 17:34 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and
stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in
number not a few.

ALM 17:35 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of
their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that
the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands;
neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in
the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the
flocks of the king.

ALM 17:36 But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his
sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he
slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his
power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and
they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could not
hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.

ALM 17:37 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote
off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting
their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be
astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number;
and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.

ALM 17:38 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it
were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as
were lifted against him, and they were not a few.

ALM 17:39 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered
their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in
unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of
Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king
for a testimony of the things which they had done.

ALM 18:0 King Lamoni mistakes Ammon for the Great Spirit--He is taught
concerning the true God--Is overcome by the Spirit of the Lord.

ALM 18:1 And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should
stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the
matter.

ALM 18:2 And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and
he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also
of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was
astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is
not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this
people, because of their murders?

ALM 18:3 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit
or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the
enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with
us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is
a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such
great power, for we know he cannot be slain.

ALM 18:4 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I
know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve
your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren. Now this is the
Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken.

ALM 18:5 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his
father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great
Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni
began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his
servants;

ALM 18:6 For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered
their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks
scattered they were slain.

ALM 18:7 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of
Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away
many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder
among them.

ALM 18:8 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying:
Where is this man that has such great power?

ALM 18:9 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king
had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their
flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth
to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of
Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

ALM 18:10 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and
his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon,
saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has
been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to
execute them.

ALM 18:11 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire
him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.

ALM 18:12 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the
chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw
that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return
out of his presence.

ALM 18:13 And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is,
being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be
powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.

ALM 18:14 Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What
wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for
the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should
say unto him.

ALM 18:15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest
thou of me? But the king answered him not.

ALM 18:16 And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God,
therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it
because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew
seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the
arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it
this that causeth thy marvelings?

ALM 18:17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great? Behold,
I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is
right, that will I do.

ALM 18:18 Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he
beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king
Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great
Spirit, who knows all things?

ALM 18:19 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.

ALM 18:20 And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou
mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by
what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my
flocks--

ALM 18:21 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever
thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee
with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they;
nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.

ALM 18:22 Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou
hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this
is the thing that I desire of thee.

ALM 18:23 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy
words. And thus he was caught with guile.

ALM 18:24 And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him:
Believest thou that there is a God?

ALM 18:25 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth.

ALM 18:26 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit?

ALM 18:27 And he said, Yea.

ALM 18:28 And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again: Believest
thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven
and in the earth?

ALM 18:29 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in
the earth; but I do not know the heavens.

ALM 18:30 And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and
all his holy angels.

ALM 18:31 And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?

ALM 18:32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of
men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand
were they all created from the beginning.

ALM 18:33 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast
spoken. Art thou sent from God?

ALM 18:34 Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created
after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these
things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which
is just and true;

ALM 18:35 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me
knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.

ALM 18:36 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the
world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning
the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy
scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to
the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.

ALM 18:37 And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to his
servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all their
sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth.

ALM 18:38 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman
and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate
unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from the
time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present time.

ALM 18:39 But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of
redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he also
made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the
Lord did he make known unto them.

ALM 18:40 And it came to pass that after he had said all these things, and
expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words.

ALM 18:41 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy;
according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi,
have upon me, and my people.

ALM 18:42 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were
dead.

ALM 18:43 And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in
unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the
space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters
mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his
loss.

ALM 19:0 A wonderful conversion--Abish the Lamanite woman--Lamanite king and
queen espouse the faith--Ammon establishes the church in Ishmael.

ALM 19:1 And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were about
to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they had made for the purpose
of burying their dead.

ALM 19:2 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent
and desired that he should come in unto her.

ALM 19:3 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in
unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that he should do.

ALM 19:4 And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it known
unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do
many mighty works in his name;

ALM 19:5 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see
my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two
nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and
that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for
myself, to me he doth not stink.

ALM 19:6 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was
under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast
away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the
light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness--yea,
this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having
been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul,
yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away
in God--

ALM 19:7 Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire.
Therefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had desired him;
and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not dead.

ALM 19:8 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God,
and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him not.

ALM 19:9 And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said unto him: I
have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I
believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.

ALM 19:10 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding
faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all
the people of the Nephites.

ALM 19:11 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her husband,
from that time even until that time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed
that he should rise.

ALM 19:12 And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of Ammon;
and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed
be the name of God, and blessed art thou.

ALM 19:13 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he
shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who
believe on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen
within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being
overpowered by the Spirit.

ALM 19:14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to his
prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of so much
mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their
iniquities and their traditions, he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out
his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his
brethren; and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had
sunk to the earth.

ALM 19:15 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen,
they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them
also, for it was they who had stood before the king and testified unto him
concerning the great power of Ammon.

ALM 19:16 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord, in
their might, even until they had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of
the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been converted unto the
Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father--

ALM 19:17 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it
known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to
the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay
prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing
that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among
them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe in the power
of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the
people.

ALM 19:18 And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of the
king. And there came a multitude, and to their astonishment, they beheld the
king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all
lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he was
a Nephite.

ALM 19:19 And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying that
it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house,
because he had suffered that the Nephite should remain in the land.

ALM 19:20 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this evil upon
his house, because he slew his servants who had had their flocks scattered at
the waters of Sebus.

ALM 19:21 And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters
of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were
angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at
the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.

ALM 19:22 Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of
Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that
he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to
smite him, behold, he fell dead.

ALM 19:23 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had said unto
Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy
faith--therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.

ALM 19:24 And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had
fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and
they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had
fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause
of this great power, or what all these things could mean.

ALM 19:25 And it came to pass that there were many among them who said that
Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;

ALM 19:26 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster, who had
been sent from the Nephites to torment them.

ALM 19:27 And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit
to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit
that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their
hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of
their brethren, the Lamanites.

ALM 19:28 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them. And
while they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused the multitude
to be gathered together came, and when she saw the contention which was among
the multitude she was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.

ALM 19:29 And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand,
that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched
her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice,
saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God,
have mercy on this people!

ALM 19:30 And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being filled with
joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she had done this,
she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his
feet.

ALM 19:31 And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went
forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words which he had heard
from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his words believed, and were
converted unto the Lord.

ALM 19:32 But there were many among them who would not hear his words;
therefore they went their way.

ALM 19:33 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto
them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto
the people the selfsame thing--that their hearts had been changed; that they
had no more desire to do evil.

ALM 19:34 And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen
angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God,
and of his righteousness.

ALM 19:35 And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in their
words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous
people, and they did establish a church among them.

ALM 19:36 And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus
the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is
extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.

ALM 20:0 Ammon and king Lamoni journey to Middoni--the meet Lamoni's father who
is king over all the land--Hostile at first, he relents, and grants great
favors.

ALM 20:1 And it came to pass that when they had established a church in that
land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of
Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.

ALM 20:2 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up
to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt
go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and
Ammah are in prison.

ALM 20:3 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto
Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that
I may deliver them.

ALM 20:4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord thou
canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni;
for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto
me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the
land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto him:
Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?

ALM 20:5 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he
said unto me--Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land
of Middoni.

ALM 20:6 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make
ready his horses and his chariots.

ALM 20:7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of
Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren
out of prison.

ALM 20:8 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying thither,
they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.

ALM 20:9 And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not come to
the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my
people?

ALM 20:10 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is
one of the children of a liar?

ALM 20:11 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was
going, for he feared to offend him.

ALM 20:12 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own
kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.

ALM 20:13 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold,
to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art
going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our
fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their
cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our
property.

ALM 20:14 Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with
the sword. And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of
Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael.

ALM 20:15 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I
return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I may
release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy
prophets of the true God.

ALM 20:16 Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and
he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.

ALM 20:17 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay
thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should fall than thee, for
behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in
thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.

ALM 20:18 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou
shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the
ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou
wouldst lose thy soul.

ALM 20:19 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him,
saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood;
for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.

ALM 20:20 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon withstood
his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use it.

ALM 20:21 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead
with Ammon that he would spare his life.

ALM 20:22 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite
thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.

ALM 20:23 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt
spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the
kingdom.

ALM 20:24 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to
his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast
out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not
displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in
whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite
thee to the earth.

ALM 20:25 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice
because of his life.

ALM 20:26 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he
also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished
exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would
release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom,
behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time
and forever; and I will govern him no more--

ALM 20:27 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of
prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall
greatly desire to see thee. For the king was greatly astonished at the words
which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son
Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn them.

ALM 20:28 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey
towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of
the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.

ALM 20:29 And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold
they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound
with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of
afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.

ALM 20:30 And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands
of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not
hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and
had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they
had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into
prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were
delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.

ALM 21:00 An account of the preaching of Aaron, and Muloki, and their brethren,
to the Lamanites. Comprising chapters 21 to 26 inclusive.

ALM 21:0 Rejected by the Amalekites, Aaron and Muloki go to Middoni--They are
imprisoned--Their release and missionary labors--Ammon's further
success--Synagogues built.

ALM 21:1 Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of
the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which
was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their
fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.

ALM 21:2 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had
built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.

ALM 21:3 Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the
Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the
Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in
wickedness and their abominations.

ALM 21:4 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and
first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in
their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the order of the Nehors;
for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the
Nehors.

ALM 21:5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach
unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an
Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast
testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold
are not this people as good as thy people?

ALM 21:6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest thou
the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to
repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people? Behold, we have
built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do
believe that God will save all men.

ALM 21:7 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come
to redeem mankind from their sins?

ALM 21:8 And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any
such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe
that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and
also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that
which is to come.

ALM 21:9 Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming
of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there
could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and
sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.

ALM 21:10 And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them
they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they would not hear the
words which he spake.

ALM 21:11 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he
departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which was called
Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also
Ammah and his brethren. And they contended with many about the word.

ALM 21:12 And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their
hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And
they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they
taught.

ALM 21:13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken
and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni
unto the regions round about.

ALM 21:14 And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and they
were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed.

ALM 21:15 And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were
delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.

ALM 21:16 And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of the
Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in
every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted.

ALM 21:17 And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them, insomuch that
they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many of
their sins, and of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.

ALM 21:18 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of
Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance.

ALM 21:19 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him, or be
his servant.

ALM 21:20 But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of
Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who were under his reign,
should assemble themselves together.

ALM 21:21 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And
he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and
that they were a free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the
king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign
over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round
about.

ALM 21:22 And he also declared unto them that they might have the liberty of
worshiping the Lord their God according to their desires, in whatsoever place
they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni.

ALM 21:23 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to
pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to
righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and they gave
heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.

ALM 22:0 Aaron in the land of Nephi--The king and all his household
converted--Country divided between Nephites and Lamanites.

ALM 22:1 Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we
will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed
from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to
the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of
Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.

ALM 22:2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's palace,
with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him:
Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of
prison.

ALM 22:3 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy
servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your
lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist
that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind
because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon;
and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.

ALM 22:4 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has
called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people
of Lamoni.

ALM 22:5 Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said concerning
the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me.

ALM 22:6 And also, what is this that Ammon said--If ye will repent ye shall be
saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?

ALM 22:7 And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is
a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God,
and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may
assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a
God, behold I will believe.

ALM 22:8 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he
said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.

ALM 22:9 And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers
out of the land of Jerusalem?

ALM 22:10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created
all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou this?

ALM 22:11 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things,
and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will
believe thy words.

ALM 22:12 And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe
his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the
king--how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him
commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.

ALM 22:13 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of
Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the
plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world,
through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.

ALM 22:14 And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but
the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and
repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the
grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up
in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.

ALM 22:15 And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto
him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which
thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this
wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be
filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I
will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may
receive this great joy.

ALM 22:16 But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt
bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow
down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall
receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.

ALM 22:17 And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king
did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate
himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:

ALM 22:18 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God,
and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away
all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved
at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as
if he were dead.

ALM 22:19 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that
had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him
lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they
had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her
servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.

ALM 22:20 Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall, therefore
they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with
the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when
behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before
them.

ALM 22:21 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to
fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded
her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay
Aaron and his brethren.

ALM 22:22 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing
the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should
assemble themselves together, and there should be a great contention and a
disturbance among them; therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king
from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet, receiving
his strength.

ALM 22:23 Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the
servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And
the king stood forth, and began to minister unto them. And he did minister unto
them, insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord.

ALM 22:24 Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the
commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them
because of Aaron and his brethren.

ALM 22:25 But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them. And
they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.

ALM 22:26 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were
pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst
of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.

ALM 22:27 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all
the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the
regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on
the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of
wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about
on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on
the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head
of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west--and thus were the
Lamanites and the Nephites divided.

ALM 22:28 Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and
dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the
land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the
borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of
their fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore.

ALM 22:29 And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore,
whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly
surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of
all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of
the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side;
on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful.

ALM 22:30 And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation, it being
so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been
destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the people of
Zarahemla, it being the place of their first landing.

ALM 22:31 And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land
on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was
called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of
wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward
for food.

ALM 22:32 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's journey for a
Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the
west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly
surrounded by water, there being a small neck of land between the land
northward and the land southward.

ALM 22:33 And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land
Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their
wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the
south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they
might not overrun the land northward.

ALM 22:34 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the
land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the
Nephites--as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their
afflictions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they
might flee, according to their desires.

ALM 22:35 And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of
Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.

ALM 23:0 Religious freedom is proclaimed--Many Lamanites converted--Amalekites
and Amulonites reject the truth--The Anti-Nephi-Lehies.

ALM 23:1 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a
proclamation among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on
Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go
forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any
part of their land.

ALM 23:2 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands
on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit
upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge
them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free
access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.

ALM 23:3 And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their
desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all his household;
therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that
the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth
throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the
wicked traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they
were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to
steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness.

ALM 23:4 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this
proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to city, and
from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating
priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to
teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.

ALM 23:5 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea,
thousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites; and they
were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down even to the
present time.

ALM 23:6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as
many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of
Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy,
and the power of God working miracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord
liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were
converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.

ALM 23:7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of
their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against
any of their brethren.

ALM 23:8 Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:

ALM 23:9 The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;

ALM 23:10 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of
Middoni;

ALM 23:11 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city of
Nephi;

ALM 23:12 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of
Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and in
the city of Shimnilom.

ALM 23:13 And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were
converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their
rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites.

ALM 23:14 And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were
any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of
the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all
their villages and all their cities.

ALM 23:15 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which
they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and were converted.

ALM 23:16 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted
were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be
distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and
many of their priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them,
that they might be distinguished.

ALM 23:17 And it came to pass that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies;
and they were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.

ALM 23:18 And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were
friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a correspondence with
them, and the curse of God did no more follow them.

ALM 24:0 Lamanites come against the people of God--Converted Lamanites refuse
to take up arms--More conversions.

ALM 24:1 And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the
Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and
who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about,
who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of
Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to
anger against their brethren.

ALM 24:2 And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even insomuch
that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that
he should be their king; therefore, they took up arms against the people of
Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

ALM 24:3 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his
name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

ALM 24:4 And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to
make preparations for war against the people of God.

ALM 24:5 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him
saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came
forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from
thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with
Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend
themselves against the Lamanites.

ALM 24:6 Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted
unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would
not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them
that they should not.

ALM 24:7 Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the
matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness
sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to
convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.

ALM 24:8 And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his
Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these
brethren, the Nephites.

ALM 24:9 And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence
we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which we have
committed.

ALM 24:10 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto
us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of
those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the
guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.

ALM 24:11 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do,
(as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the
many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our
hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he
would take away our stain--

ALM 24:12 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains,
and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with
the blood of our brethren.

ALM 24:13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be
not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our
swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of
our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.

ALM 24:14 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known
unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto
us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children;
therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of
salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.

ALM 24:15 Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as
much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are
made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony
to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand
before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of
our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.

ALM 24:16 And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we
will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that
they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the
last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and
shall be saved.

ALM 24:17 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these
sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords,
and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they
did bury them up deep in the earth.

ALM 24:18 And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and
also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's
blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than
shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather
than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend
their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.

ALM 24:19 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe
and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather
than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or
they buried the weapons of war, for peace.

ALM 24:20 And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made
preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of
destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.

ALM 24:21 Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went
out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began
to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the
Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.

ALM 24:22 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and
five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell
with their God.

ALM 24:23 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from
the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but
that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of
perishing under the sword--

ALM 24:24 Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them;
and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their
brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which
they had done.

ALM 24:25 And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and
they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they
had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the
mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.

ALM 24:26 And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by
more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were
righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were
saved.

ALM 24:27 And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more
than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the
Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.

ALM 24:28 Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of
their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were
after the order of the Nehors.

ALM 24:29 Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none
who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they
were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.

ALM 24:30 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once
enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things
pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and
transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse
than though they had never known these things.

ALM 25:0 Lamanite aggressions--Vengeance by Amulonites--Martyrdoms--Further
fulfillment of Abinadi's prophecy.

ALM 25:1 And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry
because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the
Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at
that time.

ALM 25:2 But they took their armies and went over into the borders of the land
of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the land of Ammonihah and
destroyed them.

ALM 25:3 And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in the which
they were driven and slain.

ALM 25:4 And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the seed of
Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah, and they were slain by
the hands of the Nephites;

ALM 25:5 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and having
usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused that many of the
Lamanites should perish by fire because of their belief--

ALM 25:6 For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many
afflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words which Aaron and
his brethren had preached to them in their land; therefore they began to
disbelieve the traditions of their fathers, and to believe in the Lord, and
that he gave great power unto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them
converted in the wilderness.

ALM 25:7 And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of the
children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death, yea, all those that
believed in these things.

ALM 25:8 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be
stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and
the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to
slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.

ALM 25:9 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the
words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the
priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire.

ALM 25:10 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a type of
things to come.

ALM 25:11 And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire because of
his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that many should suffer death by
fire, according as he had suffered.

ALM 25:12 And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause
many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be
scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and
slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were
driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.

ALM 25:13 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not
overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them
came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join
themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

ALM 25:14 And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their
brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the
ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.

ALM 25:15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient that
they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all fulfilled. But
notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look forward to the coming of
Christ, considering that the law of Moses was a type of his coming, and
believing that they must keep those outward performances until the time that he
should be revealed unto them.

ALM 25:16 Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of Moses; but
the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith in Christ; and thus they
did retain a hope through faith, unto eternal salvation, relying upon the
spirit of prophecy, which spake of those things to come.

ALM 25:17 And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and their
brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which they had had among the
Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had granted unto them according to their
prayers, and that he had also verified his word unto them in every particular.

ALM 26:0 Ammon glories in the Lord--Boasting in righteousness--he recounts
blessings to him and his brethren.

ALM 26:1 And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which say thus:
My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how great reason have we to
rejoice; for could we have supposed when we started from the land of Zarahemla
that God would have granted unto us such great blessings?

ALM 26:2 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? Can ye
tell?

ALM 26:3 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in
darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are
brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which
hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of
God to bring about this great work.

ALM 26:4 Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought into the
fold of God.

ALM 26:5 Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in
the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor;
and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the
garners, that they are not wasted.

ALM 26:6 Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea,
neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh
they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate
to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the
enemy listeth to carry them.

ALM 26:7 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they
are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.

ALM 26:8 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise, yea, let us
give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work righteousness forever.

ALM 26:9 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our
dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been
racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to
God.

ALM 26:10 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his brother
Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy doth carry thee away unto
boasting.

ALM 26:11 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength, nor in my
own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart is brim with joy, and I
will rejoice in my God.

ALM 26:12 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore
I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I
can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this
land, for which we will praise his name forever.

ALM 26:13 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the
pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and this because of
the power of his word which is in us, therefore have we not great reason to
rejoice?

ALM 26:14 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most High
God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.

ALM 26:15 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and
destruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting light, yea,
into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled about with the matchless
bounty of his love; yea, and we have been instruments in his hands of doing
this great and marvelous work.

ALM 26:16 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea, we will
rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God forever. Behold, who
can glory too much in the Lord? Yea, who can say too much of his great power,
and of his mercy, and of his long-suffering towards the children of men?
Behold, I say unto you, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.

ALM 26:17 Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as
to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?

ALM 26:18 Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings to
destroy his church.

ALM 26:19 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction, yea, why
did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us, and doom us to eternal
despair?

ALM 26:20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. Behold, he did
not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great mercy hath brought us over
that everlasting gulf of death and misery, even to the salvation of our souls.

ALM 26:21 And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that knoweth
these things? I say unto you, there is none that knoweth these things, save it
be the penitent.

ALM 26:22 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good
works, and prayeth continually without ceasing--unto such it is given to know
the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which
never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring
thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring
these our brethren to repentance.

ALM 26:23 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in
the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our
brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?

ALM 26:24 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites
to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites
of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a
people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days
have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a
transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was
their language.

ALM 26:25 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we
destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and
destroy us.

ALM 26:26 But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with
the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might
save some few of their souls.

ALM 26:27 Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back,
behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the
Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you
success.

ALM 26:28 And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we
have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea,
we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the
world--not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.

ALM 26:29 And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have
taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills;
and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught
them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our
cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and
cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been
delivered again.

ALM 26:30 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that
perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy
would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.

ALM 26:31 Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and
are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of
their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards
us.

ALM 26:32 For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take
the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the
earth, because of their love towards their brethren.

ALM 26:33 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all
the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.

ALM 26:34 For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they
would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how many of these have laid
down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of
their love and of their hatred to sin.

ALM 26:35 Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never
were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea,
and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power,
all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a
merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on
his name.

ALM 26:36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life
and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo.
Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who
are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a
strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful
of us, wanderers in a strange land.

ALM 26:37 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people,
whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of
mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving;
yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.

ALM 27:0 People of Anti-Nephi-Lehi seek safety in Zarahemla--they are called
the people of Ammon--Land of Jershon given to them.

ALM 27:1 Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war
against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to destroy them,
that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they returned again to the land
of Nephi.

ALM 27:2 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were
exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the
Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their brethren, the
people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.

ALM 27:3 Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they suffered
themselves to be slain according to the desires of their enemies.

ALM 27:4 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction among
those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved
them--for they were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save
them from everlasting destruction--therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw
this great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and they said
unto the king:

ALM 27:5 Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go down to
the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands
of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.

ALM 27:6 But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us,
because of the many murders and sins we have committed against them.

ALM 27:7 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say unto
us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?

ALM 27:8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we will
go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto
them the many murders and sins which we have committed against them.

ALM 27:9 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren, which
was established by my father, that there should be any slaves among them;
therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren.

ALM 27:10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto
us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the land.

ALM 27:11 And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord, and the
Lord said unto him:

ALM 27:12 Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has
great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to
anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land;
and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will preserve them.

ALM 27:13 And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all the
words which the Lord had said unto him.

ALM 27:14 And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the people of
the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and herds, and departed out
of the land, and came into the wilderness which divided the land of Nephi from
the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land.

ALM 27:15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my
brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here
until we return; and we will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will
that ye shall come into their land.

ALM 27:16 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land, that
he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and
behold, this was a joyful meeting.

ALM 27:17 Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he was
swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength; and
he fell again to the earth.

ALM 27:18 Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which none
receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness.

ALM 27:19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and also
the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to
exceed their strength.

ALM 27:20 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the
land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went and told the chief
judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among
their brethren, the Lamanites.

ALM 27:21 And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation
throughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people concerning the
admitting their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.

ALM 27:22 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying:
Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea,
which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful;
and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an
inheritance.

ALM 27:23 And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the
land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we
do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their
brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of
their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and
their awful wickedness.

ALM 27:24 And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may
inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our
armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of their substance to
assist us that we may maintain our armies.

ALM 27:25 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to
the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness,
where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things.
And Alma also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his
brethren.

ALM 27:26 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And they
went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon;
and they were called by the Nephites the people of Ammon; therefore they were
distinguished by that name ever after.

ALM 27:27 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the
people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for
their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest
and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto
the end.

ALM 27:28 And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the
greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms
against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of
terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore,
death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.

ALM 27:29 Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating and
distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they
would take the sword or cimeter to smite them.

ALM 27:30 And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored
people of the Lord.

ALM 28:0 Lamanites make war upon Nephites--A tremendous battle--Lamanites
defeated--Deep mourning.

ALM 28:1 And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were
established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established in the land
of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of
Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the
armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.

ALM 28:2 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never
had been known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left
Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered
abroad.

ALM 28:3 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of
Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the people of
Nephi returned again to their land.

ALM 28:4 And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and
lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi--

ALM 28:5 Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of
fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the brother, yea, the
brother for the father; and thus the cry of mourning was heard among all of
them, mourning for their kindred who had been slain.

ALM 28:6 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of solemnity, and
a time of much fasting and prayer.

ALM 28:7 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi;

ALM 28:8 And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings
in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their
afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the reception and safety of
the brethren in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all
men, bless their souls forever.

ALM 28:9 And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the
Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites; and the
fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.

ALM 28:10 And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass the
destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful scene
of bloodshed.

ALM 28:11 And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth, while the
bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth;
yea, and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because
they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are
consigned to a state of endless wo.

ALM 28:12 While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their
kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know, according to
the promises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of
God, in a state of never-ending happiness.

ALM 28:13 And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and
transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans
which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.

ALM 28:14 And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the
vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of
rejoicing--sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because
of the light of Christ unto life.

ALM 29:0 Alma's yearning desire to cry repentance to all--God's word
apportioned in wisdom--Alma rejoices over success of his brethren.

ALM 29:1 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart, that I
might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a voice to shake the
earth, and cry repentance unto every people!

ALM 29:2 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of thunder,
repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should repent and come unto
our God, that there might not be more sorrow upon all the face of the earth.

ALM 29:3 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to be
content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.

ALM 29:4 I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God,
for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be
unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth
unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they
be unto salvation or unto destruction.

ALM 29:5 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that
knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to
him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil,
life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.

ALM 29:6 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more than to
perform the work to which I have been called?

ALM 29:7 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak unto all
the ends of the earth?

ALM 29:8 For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation
and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they
should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according
to that which is just and true.

ALM 29:9 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do
not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea,
and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God
to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.

ALM 29:10 And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming
to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what
the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do
I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.

ALM 29:11 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do
know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish
his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.

ALM 29:12 Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that
same God who delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them
out of bondage.

ALM 29:13 Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and
that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this
people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.

ALM 29:14 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full
because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.

ALM 29:15 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much
fruit; and how great shall be their reward!

ALM 29:16 Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is
carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great
is my joy.

ALM 29:17 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down
in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their
labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And
may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken.
Amen.

ALM 30:0 Korihor the Anti-Christ--Expelled from Jershon and arrested at
Gideon--Arraigned in Zarahemla--he demands a sign and is stricken dumb--His
miserable death.

ALM 30:1 Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were
established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the Lamanites were
driven out of the land, and their dead were buried by the people of the land--

ALM 30:2 Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of their
numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites numbered--but it came to pass
after they had buried their dead, and also after the days of fasting, and
mourning, and prayer, (and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the
judges over the people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout
all the land.

ALM 30:3 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the Lord;
and they were strict in observing the ordinances of God, according to the law
of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of Moses until it should be
fulfilled.

ALM 30:4 And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the sixteenth year
of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

ALM 30:5 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the seventeenth year
of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace.

ALM 30:6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year, there
came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was Anti-Christ, for he began to
preach unto the people against the prophecies which had been spoken by the
prophets, concerning the coming of Christ.

ALM 30:7 Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly
contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring
men on to unequal grounds.

ALM 30:8 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will serve.

ALM 30:9 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or rather, if
he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him; but if he did not believe
in him there was no law to punish him.

ALM 30:10 But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he robbed he
was also punished; and if he stole he was also punished; and if he committed
adultery he was also punished; yea, for all this wickedness they were punished.

ALM 30:11 For there was a law that men should be judged according to their
crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man
was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on
equal grounds.

ALM 30:12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law could have
no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that there should be no
Christ. And after this manner did he preach, saying:

ALM 30:13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why do ye
yoke yourselves with such foolish things? Why do ye look for a Christ? For no
man can know of anything which is to come.

ALM 30:14 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say are
handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish traditions of your
fathers.

ALM 30:15 How do ye know of their surety? Behold, ye cannot know of things
which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there shall be a Christ.

ALM 30:16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But
behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds
comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a
belief of things which are not so.

ALM 30:17 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that
there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in
this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man
prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to
his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.

ALM 30:18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many,
causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many
women, and also men, to commit whoredoms--telling them that when a man was
dead, that was the end thereof.

ALM 30:19 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach these
things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people of the Lamanites.

ALM 30:20 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for they
took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who was a high priest
over that people.

ALM 30:21 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried out of
the land. And he came over into the land of Gideon, and began to preach unto
them also; and here he did not have much success, for he was taken and bound
and carried before the high priest, and also the chief judge over the land.

ALM 30:22 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why do ye go
about perverting the ways of the Lord? Why do ye teach this people that there
shall be no Christ, to interrupt their rejoicings? Why do ye speak against all
the prophecies of the holy prophets?

ALM 30:23 Now the high priest's name was Giddonah. And Korihor said unto him:
Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your fathers, and because I do
not teach this people to bind themselves down under the foolish ordinances and
performances which are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and
authority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not lift up their
heads, but be brought down according to thy words.

ALM 30:24 Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in
bondage. Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. Behold, I say that ye
do not know that they are true.

ALM 30:25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of
the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because
of its parents.

ALM 30:26 And ye also say that Christ shall come. But behold, I say that ye do
not know that there shall be a Christ. And ye say also that he shall be slain
for the sins of the world--

ALM 30:27 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of
your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as
it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands,
that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their
rights and privileges.

ALM 30:28 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they
should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and
have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their
whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if
they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they
say is God--a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever
will be.

ALM 30:29 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his
heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not
make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they
delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of
Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was
governor over all the land.

ALM 30:30 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the
chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon;
yea, he went on to blaspheme.

ALM 30:31 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did
revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the
people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on
the labors of the people.

ALM 30:32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves
upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the
commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my
support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the
word of God unto my people.

ALM 30:33 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the
church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither
has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have
received only according to law for our time.

ALM 30:34 And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church,
what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the
truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?

ALM 30:35 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain,
when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou
that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?

ALM 30:36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.

ALM 30:37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?

ALM 30:38 And he answered, Nay.

ALM 30:39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and
also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and
also that Christ shall come.

ALM 30:40 And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ
cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.

ALM 30:41 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are
true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true;
and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?

ALM 30:42 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a
lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place
in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working
devices that he may destroy the children of God.

ALM 30:43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I
may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and
then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.

ALM 30:44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt
your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all
these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid
before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth,
and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also
all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a
Supreme Creator.

ALM 30:45 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people,
testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these
witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.

ALM 30:46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved
because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the
spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.

ALM 30:47 But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou
shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying
and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God
shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy
mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.

ALM 30:48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but
I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that
there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.

ALM 30:49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that
thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name
of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.

ALM 30:50 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he
could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.

ALM 30:51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and
wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did
ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict
others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and
now will ye dispute more?

ALM 30:52 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am
dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God
could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.

ALM 30:53 But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in
the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they
have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no
God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his
words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I
taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed
that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I
have brought this great curse upon me.

ALM 30:54 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto
God, that the curse might be taken from him.

ALM 30:55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou
wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto
thee even as the Lord will.

ALM 30:56 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but
he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.

ALM 30:57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately
published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the
chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had
believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same
judgments would come unto them.

ALM 30:58 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of
Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an
end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from
house to house, begging food for his support.

ALM 30:59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea,
among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called
themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram--and as he went
forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was
dead.

ALM 30:60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord;
and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day,
but doth speedily drag them down to hell.

ALM 31:0 Alma heads a mission to reclaim the apostate Zoramites--The Rameumptom
or holy stand--The Zoramite form of worship.

ALM 31:1 Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having
received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and
that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow
down to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of
the people.

ALM 31:2 For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among
his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the
separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.

ALM 31:3 Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which
they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly
bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also
bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.

ALM 31:4 Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a
correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss
on the part of the Nephites.

ALM 31:5 And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the
people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the
minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto
them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue
of the word of God.

ALM 31:6 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave
in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also
Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.

ALM 31:7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was
Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and
Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the
Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.

ALM 31:8 Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they
had had the word of God preached unto them.

ALM 31:9 But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to
keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.

ALM 31:10 Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to
continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter
into temptation.

ALM 31:11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many
instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land
to preach the word unto them.

ALM 31:12 Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment
they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather
themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of
the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had
never beheld;

ALM 31:13 For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a
place for standing, which was high above the head, and the top thereof would
only admit one person.

ALM 31:14 Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon
the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a
loud voice, saying:

ALM 31:15 Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that
thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and
that thou wilt be a spirit forever.

ALM 31:16 Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren;
and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down
to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast
elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us
that there shall be no Christ.

ALM 31:17 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast
elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast
by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we
also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after
the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief
of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.

ALM 31:18 And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy
people. Amen.

ALM 31:19 Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had
heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.

ALM 31:20 For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers.

ALM 31:21 Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being
interpreted, is the holy stand.

ALM 31:22 Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame
prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he
did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their
hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew
nothing about.

ALM 31:23 Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner,
they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again until they had
assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after
their manner.

ALM 31:24 Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they
were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set
upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.

ALM 31:25 Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great
boasting, in their pride.

ALM 31:26 And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long,
O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh,
to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?

ALM 31:27 Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed
up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while
they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.

ALM 31:28 Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their
bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which
they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet
they cry unto thee and say--We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people
unto thee, while others shall perish.

ALM 31:29 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there
shall be no Christ.

ALM 31:30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and
infidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that
I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among
this people doth pain my soul.

ALM 31:31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul
in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may
suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the
iniquity of this people.

ALM 31:32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also
my fellow laborers who are with me--yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also
Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons--yea, even all these wilt thou comfort,
O Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.

ALM 31:33 Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may
bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of
this people.

ALM 31:34 O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing
them again unto thee in Christ.

ALM 31:35 Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our
brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring
these, our brethren, again unto thee.

ALM 31:36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he
clapped his hands upon all them who were with him. And behold, as he clapped
his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.

ALM 31:37 And after that they did separate themselves one from another, taking
no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what they should drink, or
what they should put on.

ALM 31:38 And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither
should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should
suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of
Christ. Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he
prayed in faith.

ALM 32:0 The poor hearken to message of salvation--Alma's commendation and
discourse--Faith developed by desire to believe.

ALM 32:1 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the
word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their
houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.

ALM 32:2 And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to
have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of
the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel--

ALM 32:3 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to
worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they
were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things
of the world; and also they were poor in heart.

ALM 32:4 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill
Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have
been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the
things of the world.

ALM 32:5 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them
said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised
of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests;
for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to
build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding
poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?

ALM 32:6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face
immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their
afflictions had truly humbled them and that they were in a preparation to hear
the word.

ALM 32:7 Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched
forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent,
and said unto them:

ALM 32:8 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.

ALM 32:9 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do? --for we are cast out
of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.

ALM 32:10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save
it be in your synagogues only?

ALM 32:11 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God
only once in a week?

ALM 32:12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues,
that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that
ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are
despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are
brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.

ALM 32:13 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a
man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now
surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and
endureth to the end the same shall be saved.

ALM 32:14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be
humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly
humble themselves because of the word?

ALM 32:15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and
endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed--yea, much more blessed than
they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.

ALM 32:16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being
compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth
in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without
being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will
believe.

ALM 32:17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from
heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.

ALM 32:18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man
knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.

ALM 32:19 And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and
doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and
falleth into transgression?

ALM 32:20 Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is
on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man
according to his work.

ALM 32:21 And now as I said concerning faith--faith is not to have a perfect
knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are
not seen, which are true.

ALM 32:22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember,
that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth,
in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.

ALM 32:23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men
but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto
them many times which confound the wise and the learned.

ALM 32:24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what
ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out--now I do not desire that ye
should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true--

ALM 32:25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble
yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble
themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.

ALM 32:26 Now, as I said concerning faith--that it was not a perfect
knowledge--even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at
first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.

ALM 32:27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an
experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can
no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye
believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.

ALM 32:28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place,
that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a
good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the
Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and
when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within
yourselves--It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is
good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my
understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.

ALM 32:29 Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea;
nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.

ALM 32:30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to
grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth,
and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen
your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that
this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.

ALM 32:31 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto
you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.

ALM 32:32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not,
behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.

ALM 32:33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted
the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs
know that the seed is good.

ALM 32:34 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is
perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know,
for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it
hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and
your mind doth begin to expand.

ALM 32:35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light;
and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must
know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your
knowledge perfect?

ALM 32:36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for
ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the
experiment to know if the seed was good.

ALM 32:37 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us
nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and
bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it
will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.

ALM 32:38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment,
behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and
scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and
cast it out.

ALM 32:39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because
the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is
barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit
thereof.

ALM 32:40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an
eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree
of life.

ALM 32:41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it
beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience,
looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall
be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.

ALM 32:42 And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with
the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye
shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all
that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above
all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled,
that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.

ALM 32:43 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your
diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring
forth fruit unto you.

ALM 33:0 Alma's discourse continued--True worship not confined to
sanctuaries--The prophets Zenos and Zenock again cited.

ALM 33:1 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him
desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain
this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the
word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or
in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.

ALM 33:2 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not
worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say
unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye
ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this,
ye do not understand them.

ALM 33:3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said
concerning prayer or worship?

ALM 33:4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer,
even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed
concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.

ALM 33:5 Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in
my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.

ALM 33:6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear me in my
prayer.

ALM 33:7 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto thee, thou
didst hear me.

ALM 33:8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to
be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them.

ALM 33:9 Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the
midst of thy congregations.

ALM 33:10 Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have
been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry
with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy
destruction.

ALM 33:11 And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity;
and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me,
therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy;
for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.

ALM 33:12 And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which
have been written by them of old?

ALM 33:13 Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he
said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.

ALM 33:14 Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures?
If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?

ALM 33:15 For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things, but
Zenock also spake of these things--

ALM 33:16 For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this people,
because they will not understand thy mercies which thou hast bestowed upon them
because of thy Son.

ALM 33:17 And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has
testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his
words they stoned him to death.

ALM 33:18 But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have
spoken concerning the Son of God.

ALM 33:19 Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised
up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many
did look and live.

ALM 33:20 But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of
the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that
they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not
look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.

ALM 33:21 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your
eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather
harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about
your eyes, that ye might perish?

ALM 33:22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about your
eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will come to redeem his
people, and that he shall suffer and die to atone for their sins; and that he
shall rise again from the dead, which shall bring to pass the resurrection,
that all men shall stand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day,
according to their works.

ALM 33:23 And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word in your
hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it by your faith. And
behold, it will become a tree, springing up in you unto everlasting life. And
then may God grant unto you that your burdens may be light, through the joy of
his Son. And even all this can ye do if ye will. Amen.

ALM 34:0 Amulek's testimony--The great and last sacrifice--how mercy satisfies
justice--Repentance not to be procrastinated.

ALM 34:1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto
them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them,
saying:

ALM 34:2 My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant
of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is
taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught
unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.

ALM 34:3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known
unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken
somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto
faith and to patience--

ALM 34:4 Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word
in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.

ALM 34:5 And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is
whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.

ALM 34:6 And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many
instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.

ALM 34:7 My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh
through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has
appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.

ALM 34:8 And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things
are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among
the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and
that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.

ALM 34:9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to
the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all
mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and
are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is
expedient should be made.

ALM 34:10 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice;
yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl;
for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal
sacrifice.

ALM 34:11 Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will
atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law,
which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.

ALM 34:12 But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore
there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice
for the sins of the world.

ALM 34:13 Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last
sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop
to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it
shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.

ALM 34:14 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing
to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the
Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.

ALM 34:15 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on
his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the
bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men
that they may have faith unto repentance.

ALM 34:16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them
in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is
exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him
that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of
redemption.

ALM 34:17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to
exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name,
that he would have mercy upon you;

ALM 34:18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.

ALM 34:19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.

ALM 34:20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your flocks.

ALM 34:21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household, both
morning, mid-day, and evening.

ALM 34:22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.

ALM 34:23 Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all
righteousness.

ALM 34:24 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may prosper in
them.

ALM 34:25 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.

ALM 34:26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and
your secret places, and in your wilderness.

ALM 34:27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full,
drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the
welfare of those who are around you.

ALM 34:28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose
that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the
needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your
substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not
any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and
ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.

ALM 34:29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross,
which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under
foot of men.

ALM 34:30 And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many
witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come
forth and bring fruit unto repentance.

ALM 34:31 Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any
longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and
therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the
great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.

ALM 34:32 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God;
yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.

ALM 34:33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses,
therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your
repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to
prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life,
then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.

ALM 34:34 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will
repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same
spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life,
that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.

ALM 34:35 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even
until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and
he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from
you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this
is the final state of the wicked.

ALM 34:36 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy
temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also
said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but
their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.

ALM 34:37 And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these
things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and
that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;

ALM 34:38 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive
it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the
dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in
truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and
blessings which he doth bestow upon you.

ALM 34:39 Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto
prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the
devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at
the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.

ALM 34:40 And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and
that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against
those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become
sinners like unto them;

ALM 34:41 But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions, with a
firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your afflictions.

ALM 35:0 Nephite missionaries retire to land of Jershon--Their Zoramite
converts, expelled from their own country, rejoin them--Preparations for war.

ALM 35:1 Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these words,
they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over into the land of
Jershon.

ALM 35:2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the word
unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of Jershon.

ALM 35:3 And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites
had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them,
they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore
they would not hearken unto the words.

ALM 35:4 And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land all the
people, and consulted with them concerning the words which had been spoken.

ALM 35:5 Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not let the
people know concerning their desires; therefore they found out privily the
minds of all the people.

ALM 35:6 And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the
people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and
his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over
also into the land of Jershon.

ALM 35:7 And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister unto them.

ALM 35:8 Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of Ammon
who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites, being a very wicked
man, sent over unto the people of Ammon desiring them that they should cast out
of their land all those who came over from them into their land.

ALM 35:9 And he breathed out many threatenings against them. And now the people
of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but
they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and
they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for
their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.

ALM 35:10 Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the people of
Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to stir them up also to
anger against them.

ALM 35:11 And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make preparations
for war against the people of Ammon, and also against the Nephites.

ALM 35:12 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

ALM 35:13 And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon, and came
over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land of Jershon for the
armies of the Nephites, that they might contend with the armies of the
Lamanites and the armies of the Zoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the
Lamanites and the Nephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges;
and an account shall be given of their wars hereafter.

ALM 35:14 And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two sons of
Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been instruments in the
hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites to repentance; and as many as
were brought to repentance were driven out of their land; but they have lands
for their inheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms to
defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their lands.

ALM 35:15 Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea for the
wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were among them; and having
been to declare the word, or sent to declare the word, among all the people in
every city; and seeing that the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and
that they began to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his heart
was exceedingly sorrowful.

ALM 35:16 Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered together, that
he might give unto them every one his charge, separately, concerning the things
pertaining unto righteousness. And we have an account of his commandments,
which he gave unto them according to his own record.

ALM 36:00 The commandments of Alma to his son, Helaman. Comprising chapters 36
and 37.

ALM 36:0 Alma recounts his sinful past, his miraculous conversion, and his
subsequent zeal in the ministry.

ALM 36:1 My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that inasmuch as
ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land.

ALM 36:2 I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity
of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it
was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he
surely did deliver them in their afflictions.

ALM 36:3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and
therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for
I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in
their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up
at the last day.

ALM 36:4 And I would not that ye think that I know of myself--not of the
temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of God.

ALM 36:5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I should
not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of his holy angel, made
these things known unto me, not of any worthiness of myself;

ALM 36:6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy the
church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us by the way.

ALM 36:7 And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder, and the
whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell to the earth, for the
fear of the Lord came upon us.

ALM 36:8 But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise. And I arose and stood up,
and beheld the angel.

ALM 36:9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed, seek no
more to destroy the church of God.

ALM 36:10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for the
space of three days and three nights that I could not open my mouth, neither
had I the use of my limbs.

ALM 36:11 And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my
brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words--If thou wilt be
destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God--I was struck
with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I
fell to the earth and I did hear no more.

ALM 36:12 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was harrowed up to
the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.

ALM 36:13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I was
tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had rebelled against my
God, and that I had not kept his holy commandments.

ALM 36:14 Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led them away
unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my iniquities, that the
very thought of coming into the presence of my God did rack my soul with
inexpressible horror.

ALM 36:15 Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct both soul
and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the presence of my God, to be
judged of my deeds.

ALM 36:16 And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked, even with
the pains of a damned soul.

ALM 36:17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I
was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to
have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one
Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.

ALM 36:18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within my
heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in the gall of
bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting chains of death.

ALM 36:19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my pains no
more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no more.

ALM 36:20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul
was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!

ALM 36:21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite
and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on
the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.

ALM 36:22 Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon
his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of
singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.

ALM 36:23 But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood
upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.

ALM 36:24 Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without
ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to
taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born
of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.

ALM 36:25 Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly
great joy in the fruit of my labors;

ALM 36:26 For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many
have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to
eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have
spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.

ALM 36:27 And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind,
yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison,
and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will
still deliver me.

ALM 36:28 And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with
him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our
fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and
he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them
out of bondage and captivity from time to time.

ALM 36:29 Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of
Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of
bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I
have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to
retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.

ALM 36:30 But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do
know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper
in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the
commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is
according to his word.

ALM 37:0 Helaman entrusted with the records and other sacred
relics--Gazelem--The Liahona a type of the word of Christ.

ALM 37:1 And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which
have been entrusted with me;

ALM 37:2 And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according
as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred
which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a wise purpose that
they are kept.

ALM 37:3 And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have
the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our
forefathers, even from the beginning--

ALM 37:4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be
kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved
by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.

ALM 37:5 And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness;
yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates
which do contain that which is holy writ.

ALM 37:6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say
unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and
small means in many instances doth confound the wise.

ALM 37:7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and
eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and
bringeth about the salvation of many souls.

ALM 37:8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should
be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea,
and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the
knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.

ALM 37:9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records
do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have
convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of
their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance;
that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to
rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.

ALM 37:10 And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many
thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiff-necked brethren,
the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the
knowledge of their Redeemer?

ALM 37:11 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I
shall forbear.

ALM 37:12 And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise
purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over
all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.

ALM 37:13 O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments
of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the
land--but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his
presence.

ALM 37:14 And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these
things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep
and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto
future generations.

ALM 37:15 And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye
transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall
be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto
Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.

ALM 37:16 But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things
which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you
must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them)
behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful
to the fulfilling of all his words.

ALM 37:17 For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for
he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.

ALM 37:18 For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things for a
wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power unto future
generations.

ALM 37:19 And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the
restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth;
and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth
his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.

ALM 37:20 Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in
fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of
God as they are written.

ALM 37:21 And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates,
that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of darkness, and their
secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may
be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and
their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made
manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.

ALM 37:22 For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness,
yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did
not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.

ALM 37:23 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone,
which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my
people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren,
yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and
abominations.

ALM 37:24 And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of
God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:

ALM 37:25 I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works
and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the
face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and
abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.

ALM 37:26 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have
been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their
secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.

ALM 37:27 And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and
their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and
all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they
know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be
destroyed.

ALM 37:28 For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction
shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God,
when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be
destroyed.

ALM 37:29 Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their
covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and their murders and
their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to
abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach
them that these people were destroyed on account of their wickedness and
abominations and their murders.

ALM 37:30 For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among
them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those
whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who
were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers
of darkness and secret combinations.

ALM 37:31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of
darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent
before they are fully ripe.

ALM 37:32 And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you;
trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting
hatred against sin and iniquity.

ALM 37:33 Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ;
teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them
to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus
Christ.

ALM 37:34 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly
in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.

ALM 37:35 O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy
youth to keep the commandments of God.

ALM 37:36 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be
unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all
thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be
placed upon the Lord forever.

ALM 37:37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for
good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may
watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart
be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at
the last day.

ALM 37:38 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which
our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called it Liahona, which
is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.

ALM 37:39 And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious
a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course
which they should travel in the wilderness.

ALM 37:40 And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore,
if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should
point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this
miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.

ALM 37:41 Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it
did show unto them marvelous works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise
their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did
not progress in their journey;

ALM 37:42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct
course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their
transgressions.

ALM 37:43 And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things
are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this
compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is
with things which are spiritual.

ALM 37:44 For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which
will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers
to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to
the promised land.

ALM 37:45 And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely
as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the
promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us
beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.

ALM 37:46 O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the
way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if
they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared,
and if we will look we may live forever.

ALM 37:47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea,
see that ye look to God and live. Go unto this people and declare the word, and
be sober. My son, farewell.

ALM 38:00 The commandments of Alma to his son, Shiblon.

ALM 38:0 Commended for faithfulness, and counseled to observe meekness and
self-control.

ALM 38:1 My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto
Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall
prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God
ye shall be cut off from his presence.

ALM 38:2 And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because
of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in
your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue
in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.

ALM 38:3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already,
because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy
long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.

ALM 38:4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou
wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with
patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did
deliver thee.

ALM 38:5 And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much
as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of
your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up
at the last day.

ALM 38:6 Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things
of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things
known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these
things.

ALM 38:7 But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto
me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have
seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder,
and it shook the whole earth.

ALM 38:8 And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most
bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord
Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did
cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.

ALM 38:9 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that
ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be
saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the
world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.

ALM 38:10 And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye
should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate
in all things.

ALM 38:11 See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not
boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.

ALM 38:12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all
your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from
idleness.

ALM 38:13 Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to
be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.

ALM 38:14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren;
but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in
mercy--yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.

ALM 38:15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day
into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto
this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.

ALM 39:00 The commandments of Alma to his son, Corianton. Comprising chapters
39 to 42 inclusive.

ALM 39:0 Corianton reproved for harlotry--His sinful conduct had affected faith
of the Zoramites--Christ's redemption retroactive.

ALM 39:1 And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than what I
said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed the steadiness of thy
brother, his faithfulness, and his diligence in keeping the commandments of
God? Behold, has he not set a good example for thee?

ALM 39:2 For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother,
among the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou
didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.

ALM 39:3 And this is not all, my son. Thou didst do that which was grievous
unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go over into the land of
Siron among the borders of the Lamanites, after the harlot Isabel.

ALM 39:4 Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for
thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast
entrusted.

ALM 39:5 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in the sight
of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save it be the shedding of
innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?

ALM 39:6 For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in
you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable;
yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not
easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not
easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.

ALM 39:7 And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of so
great a crime. I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow up your soul, if
it were not for your good.

ALM 39:8 But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye repent
they will stand as a testimony against you at the last day.

ALM 39:9 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and
go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these
things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh,
remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.

ALM 39:10 And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder
brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand
in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.

ALM 39:11 Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing;
suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots.
Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when
they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.

ALM 39:12 And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy children
to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many people to destruction;
therefore I command you, my son, in the fear of God, that ye refrain from your
iniquities;

ALM 39:13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength;
that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto
them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.

ALM 39:14 Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for behold,
you cannot carry them with you.

ALM 39:15 And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the coming
of Christ. Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that surely shall come to take
away the sins of the world; yea, he cometh to declare glad tidings of salvation
unto his people.

ALM 39:16 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were called, to
declare these glad tidings unto this people, to prepare their minds; or rather
that salvation might come unto them, that they may prepare the minds of their
children to hear the word at the time of his coming.

ALM 39:17 And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. Behold, you
marvel why these things should be known so long beforehand. Behold, I say unto
you, is not a soul at this time as precious unto God as a soul will be at the
time of his coming?

ALM 39:18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be made
known unto this people as well as unto their children?

ALM 39:19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel to
declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as after the time
of his coming?

ALM 40:0 Alma to Corianton continued--Resurrection universal--Separate states
of righteous and wicked between death and resurrection--A literal restoration.

ALM 40:1 Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I
perceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of the dead.

ALM 40:2 Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection--or, I would
say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this
corruption does not put on incorruption--until after the coming of Christ.

ALM 40:3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But behold,
my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery;
nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them
save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired
diligently of God that I might know--that is concerning the resurrection.

ALM 40:4 Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth from the
dead. Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God knoweth the time which is
appointed.

ALM 40:5 Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third
time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God
knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the
case--that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.

ALM 40:6 Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and the time
of the resurrection.

ALM 40:7 And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from this
time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?

ALM 40:8 Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to rise it
mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this mattereth not; all is as
one day with God, and time only is measured unto men.

ALM 40:9 Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise
from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the
resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the
souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know;
and this is the thing of which I do know.

ALM 40:10 And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they know
that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.

ALM 40:11 Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the
resurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the
spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea,
the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that
God who gave them life.

ALM 40:12 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are
righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a
state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles
and from all care, and sorrow.

ALM 40:13 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea,
who are evil--for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the
Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit
of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house--and these
shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and
gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by
the will of the devil.

ALM 40:14 Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness,
and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of
God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in
paradise, until the time of their resurrection.

ALM 40:15 Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness
and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first
resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the
spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to
the words which have been spoken.

ALM 40:16 And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first
resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who
shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.

ALM 40:17 Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken
of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation
to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.

ALM 40:18 Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul
with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of
Christ.

ALM 40:19 Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been
spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do
not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other
words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who
die after the resurrection of Christ.

ALM 40:20 Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the
resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and
the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and
his ascension into heaven.

ALM 40:21 But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but
this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of
the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time
which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both
soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to
their works.

ALM 40:22 Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has
been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.

ALM 40:23 The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul;
yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair
of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper
and perfect frame.

ALM 40:24 And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by
the mouths of the prophets--

ALM 40:25 And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.

ALM 40:26 But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to
things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no
unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and
consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have
been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.

ALM 41:0 Alma to Corianton continued--What restoration signifies--men to be
judged according to their deeds and desires--Self-judgment.

ALM 41:1 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of
which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have
gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been
worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.

ALM 41:2 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite
with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored
to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power
and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its
body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.

ALM 41:3 And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged
according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the
desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be
restored unto that which is good.

ALM 41:4 And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil.
Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to
its natural frame--mortality raised to immortality, corruption to
incorruption--raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to
endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the
other on the other--

ALM 41:5 The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or
good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his
desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so
shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.

ALM 41:6 And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and
desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded
unto righteousness.

ALM 41:7 These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that
are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus
they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good
or do evil.

ALM 41:8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is
prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.

ALM 41:9 And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God
upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.

ALM 41:10 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration,
that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you,
wickedness never was happiness.

ALM 41:11 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would
say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the
nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of
happiness.

ALM 41:12 And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a
thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in
a state opposite to its nature?

ALM 41:13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word
restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or
devilish for devilish--good for that which is good; righteous for that which is
righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.

ALM 41:14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal
justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these
things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored
unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a
righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded
unto you again.

ALM 41:15 For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be
restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and
justifieth him not at all.

ALM 42:0 Alma to Corianton continued--Justice and mercy expounded--The tree of
life--Mortality a period of probation--Spiritual and temporal
death--Repentance, atonement, law, punishment, all necessary.

ALM 42:1 And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry
your mind, which ye cannot understand--which is concerning the justice of God
in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice
that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.

ALM 42:2 Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold,
after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to
till the ground, from whence they were taken--yea, he drew out the man, and he
placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword
which turned every way, to keep the tree of life--

ALM 42:3 Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and
lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat
and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he
should not partake of the fruit--

ALM 42:4 And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent,
yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.

ALM 42:5 For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken
of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God,
having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been
void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.

ALM 42:6 But behold, it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as they were
cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the
earth--and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.

ALM 42:7 And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both
temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they
became subjects to follow after their own will.

ALM 42:8 Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from
this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.

ALM 42:9 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon
all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off
from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be
reclaimed from this spiritual death.

ALM 42:10 Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by
nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a
preparatory state.

ALM 42:11 And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption,
(laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being
cut off from the presence of the Lord.

ALM 42:12 And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state,
which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;

ALM 42:13 Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be
brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary
state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions,
mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now
the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.

ALM 42:14 And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the
grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be
cut off from his presence.

ALM 42:15 And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an
atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the
world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice,
that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.

ALM 42:16 Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a
punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed
opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the
soul.

ALM 42:17 Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if
there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?

ALM 42:18 Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which
brought remorse of conscience unto man.

ALM 42:19 Now, if there was no law given--if a man murdered he should
die--would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?

ALM 42:20 And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be
afraid to sin.

ALM 42:21 And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do,
or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?

ALM 42:22 But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance
granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the
creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not
so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.

ALM 42:23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and
mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the
resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men
into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be
judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.

ALM 42:24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy
claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.

ALM 42:25 What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay;
not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.

ALM 42:26 And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which
were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the
salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.

ALM 42:27 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the
waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to
come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.

ALM 42:28 If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days,
behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.

ALM 42:29 And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you
no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall
bring you down unto repentance.

ALM 42:30 O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do
not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by
denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy,
and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down
to the dust in humility.

ALM 42:31 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this
people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness,
that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may
have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words.
Amen.

ALM 43:0 Another Lamanite invasion--Armies of Moroni and Lehi surround and
overpower the enemy.

ALM 43:1 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the
people, to declare the word unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not rest,
and he also went forth.

ALM 43:2 Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they
preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and
revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which they were
called.

ALM 43:3 And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites and
the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 43:4 For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites;
therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the
Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made
preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of
Jershon.

ALM 43:5 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and
they came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a
man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader.

ALM 43:6 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous
disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore,
Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all
Amalekites and Zoramites.

ALM 43:7 Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the
Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplishment of his
designs.

ALM 43:8 For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against
the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also
that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage.

ALM 43:9 And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and
their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve
them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their
rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might
worship God according to their desires.

ALM 43:10 For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the
Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in truth, the true
and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy.

ALM 43:11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards
their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the
people of Ammon--and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a
covenant and they would not break it--therefore, if they should fall into the
hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.

ALM 43:12 And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed;
therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.

ALM 43:13 And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of
their substance to support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled,
alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and
Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the
Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests
of Noah.

ALM 43:14 Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites;
and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto
bloodshed.

ALM 43:15 And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had gathered
together in the land of Antionum, behold, the armies of the Nephites were
prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon.

ALM 43:16 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been appointed to
be the chief captain over the Nephites--now the chief captain took the command
of all the armies of the Nephites--and his name was Moroni;

ALM 43:17 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their wars.
And he was only twenty and five years old when he was appointed chief captain
over the armies of the Nephites.

ALM 43:18 And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders of
Jershon, and his people were armed with swords, and with cimeters, and all
manner of weapons of war.

ALM 43:19 And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of Nephi, or
that Moroni, had prepared his people with breastplates and with arm-shields,
yea, and also shields to defend their heads, and also they were dressed with
thick clothing--

ALM 43:20 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such thing; they
had only their swords and their cimeters, their bows and their arrows, their
stones and their slings; and they were naked, save it were a skin which was
girded about their loins; yea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and
the Amalekites;

ALM 43:21 But they were not armed with breastplates, nor shields--therefore,
they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of the Nephites because of their
armor, notwithstanding their number being so much greater than the Nephites.

ALM 43:22 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the
Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of
Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the
wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the
land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that
the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone.

ALM 43:23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness
Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also,
knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that
he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to
defend themselves against the Lamanites.

ALM 43:24 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and
Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were
marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land
of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the
people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.

ALM 43:25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest
by any means a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take
possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over
into the land of Manti.

ALM 43:26 And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should
gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their
lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were
prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites.

ALM 43:27 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should be
secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon, which was on
the west of the river Sidon in the wilderness.

ALM 43:28 And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp
of the Lamanites should come.

ALM 43:29 And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it was
their intention to destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them
into bondage that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves over all the
land;

ALM 43:30 And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to
preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought
it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore, he found by his
spies which course the Lamanites were to take.

ALM 43:31 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into the
valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah;

ALM 43:32 And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the
river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti.

ALM 43:33 And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was
prepared to meet them.

ALM 43:34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of the
hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed.

ALM 43:35 And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the
valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the
south of the hill, which was led by a man whose name was Lehi, and he led his
army forth and encircled the Lamanites about on the east in their rear.

ALM 43:36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites
coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and began to contend with the
army of Lehi.

ALM 43:37 And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was more
dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their nakedness was exposed to the
heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords and their cimeters, which brought
death almost at every stroke.

ALM 43:38 While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the
Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they being shielded from the
more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being
shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breastplates, and their
armshields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work
of death among the Lamanites.

ALM 43:39 And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of
the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the
river Sidon.

ALM 43:40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by
Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi
retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not
cross.

ALM 43:41 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the Lamanites in the
valley, on the other side of the river Sidon, and began to fall upon them and
to slay them.

ALM 43:42 And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the land of
Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.

ALM 43:43 Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea, never had
the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly great strength and
courage, no, not even from the beginning.

ALM 43:44 And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were
their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief
captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons,
and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in
two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates,
and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in
their fierce anger.

ALM 43:45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they
were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes
and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for
their rites of worship and their church.

ALM 43:46 And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed
to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers,
that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second,
ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.

ALM 43:47 And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even
unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the
Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their
country, and their rights, and their religion.

ALM 43:48 And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness
and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them.
And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with
these thoughts--yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their
freedom from bondage.

ALM 43:49 And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they
cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their
freedom from bondage.

ALM 43:50 And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that
selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites
began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.

ALM 43:51 Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the
number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were
gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.

ALM 43:52 Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on
both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.

ALM 43:53 Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the
river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they
were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror.

ALM 43:54 Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they
should stop shedding their blood.

ALM 44:0 Moroni's magnanimity--Zerahemnah rejects his peace offer, but is
compelled to accept terms--Lamanites make covenant of peach--End of Alma's
record.

ALM 44:1 And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them.
And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to
be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay
you.

ALM 44:2 Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed
your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of
bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and
ye are angry with us because of our religion.

ALM 44:3 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has
delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that
this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now
ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.

ALM 44:4 Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God
will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him,
and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we
shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.

ALM 44:5 And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful
God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our
faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by
the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty
which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance
of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that
is most dear unto us--

ALM 44:6 Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye
have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek
not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come
not again to war against us.

ALM 44:7 And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will
command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict the wounds of death
in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have
power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.

ALM 44:8 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings
he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the
hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons of war; we
will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath
unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take
our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness;
otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.

ALM 44:9 Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God
that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning
that has preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is your breastplates and
your shields that have preserved you.

ALM 44:10 And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words,
Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had received, unto
Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict.

ALM 44:11 Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the
Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not
return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your
blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have
proposed.

ALM 44:12 And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his
sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay
Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni's soldiers smote it
even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that
he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from
before them into the midst of his soldiers.

ALM 44:13 And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the
scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and
laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying
unto them with a loud voice:

ALM 44:14 Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of
your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your
weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.

ALM 44:15 Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp
which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and
threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a
covenant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to
depart into the wilderness.

ALM 44:16 Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did
stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully
against the Nephites.

ALM 44:17 And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the
Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them
and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea, and the
Lamanites did contend with their swords and their might.

ALM 44:18 But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to
the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten,
yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they
began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.

ALM 44:19 Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed,
cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his
people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they
never would come to war again against them.

ALM 44:20 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should
cease again among the people. And he took the weapons of war from the
Lamanites; and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they
were suffered to depart into the wilderness.

ALM 44:21 Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the
greatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was exceedingly great,
both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.

ALM 44:22 And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of
Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the sea.

ALM 44:23 And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came to
their houses and their lands.

ALM 44:24 And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi. And thus ended the record of Alma, which was written upon
the plates of Nephi.

ALM 45:00 The account of the people of Nephi, and their wars and dissensions,
in the days of Helaman, according to the record of Helaman, which he kept in
his days. Comprising chapters 45 to 62 inclusive.

ALM 45:0 Nephite extinction again foretold--Alma's departure compared to that
of Moses--Dissension in the church.

ALM 45:1 Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly
rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their
enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did
fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.

ALM 45:2 And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto
him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those records
which have been kept?

ALM 45:3 And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.

ALM 45:4 And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?

ALM 45:5 And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast spoken.

ALM 45:6 And Alma said unto him again: Will ye keep my commandments?

ALM 45:7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my heart.

ALM 45:8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall prosper
thee in this land.

ALM 45:9 But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I prophesy
unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not be
made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words
which I shall say.

ALM 45:10 And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people,
the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in four
hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them,
shall dwindle in unbelief.

ALM 45:11 Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and
bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall become extinct--

ALM 45:12 Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into
the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I
say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge,
yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth generation shall not
all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.

ALM 45:13 And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh
that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the
people of Nephi, shall no more be numbered among the people of Nephi.

ALM 45:14 But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and
dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto
them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and
them shall the Lamanites pursue even until they shall become extinct. And now,
because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.

ALM 45:15 And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to
Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth
for the righteous' sake.

ALM 45:16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord God--Cursed shall be the land, yea,
this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction,
which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be;
for this is the cursing and the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord
cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.

ALM 45:17 And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church, yea,
all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time henceforth.

ALM 45:18 And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of Zarahemla,
as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that he was never heard
of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.

ALM 45:19 Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying
went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the
hand of the Lord, even as Moses. But behold, the scriptures saith the Lord took
Moses unto himself; and we suppose that he has also received Alma in the
spirit, unto himself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his
death and burial.

ALM 45:20 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth year of
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Helaman went forth among
the people to declare the word unto them.

ALM 45:21 For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the many
little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the people, it became
expedient that the word of God should be declared among them, yea, and that a
regulation should be made throughout the church.

ALM 45:22 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the
church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which
was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint
priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.

ALM 45:23 And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had
appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension
among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his
brethren;

ALM 45:24 But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of
their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and
would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before God.

ALM 46:0 Amalickiah conspires to be king--Moroni and the title of liberty--The
people covenant to maintain freedom--flight of Amalickiah.

ALM 46:1 And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the words of
Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against their brethren.

ALM 46:2 And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that they were
determined to slay them.

ALM 46:3 Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a
large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.

ALM 46:4 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were
wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the
greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for
power.

ALM 46:5 And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they
would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them
rulers over the people.

ALM 46:6 Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding
the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their
exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the
church.

ALM 46:7 And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words
of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the
affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous,
notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and
their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the
hand of the Lord.

ALM 46:8 Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their
God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.

ALM 46:9 Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can
cause to take place among the children of men.

ALM 46:10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device
and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people
to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy
the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing
God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.

ALM 46:11 And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander
of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry
with Amalickiah.

ALM 46:12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece
thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom,
and our peace, our wives, and our children--and he fastened it upon the end of
a pole.

ALM 46:13 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his
shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which
had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty)
and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the
blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band
of Christians remain to possess the land--

ALM 46:14 For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the
church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.

ALM 46:15 And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those
who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ,
or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should
come.

ALM 46:16 And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the
Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.

ALM 46:17 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he
named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine,
all the land, both on the north and on the south--A chosen land, and the land
of liberty.

ALM 46:18 And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised
because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and
destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions.

ALM 46:19 And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people,
waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing
which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:

ALM 46:20 Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them
come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they
will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless
them.

ALM 46:21 And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words,
behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their
loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not
forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the
commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon
them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their
garments.

ALM 46:22 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their
garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall
be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into
transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have
cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into
transgression.

ALM 46:23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob;
yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his
brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the
commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be
cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.

ALM 46:24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us
remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part
of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he
said--Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a
remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken
unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as
the remnant of his garment.

ALM 46:25 Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath
joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.

ALM 46:26 Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.

ALM 46:27 And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which
shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and
even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.

ALM 46:28 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went
forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were
dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain
their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who
were called Amalickiahites.

ALM 46:29 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of
Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites--and he also saw that his
people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had
undertaken--therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those
of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi.

ALM 46:30 Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should
have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of
Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death;
yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and
cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah
would do that he might obtain his purposes.

ALM 46:31 Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his
armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered
into a covenant to keep the peace--and it came to pass that he took his army
and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of
Amalickiah in the wilderness.

ALM 46:32 And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and marched
forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah.

ALM 46:33 And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his
men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were
taken back into the land of Zarahemla.

ALM 46:34 Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the
voice of the people, therefore he had power according to his will with the
armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them.

ALM 46:35 And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would
not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might
maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but
few who denied the covenant of freedom.

ALM 46:36 And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be
hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the
Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites.

ALM 46:37 And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did
maintain peace in the land until nearly the end of the nineteenth year of the
reign of the judges.

ALM 46:38 And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the
church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and
rejoicing in the church.

ALM 46:39 And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly believing
that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of
the world rejoicing.

ALM 46:40 And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of
the year were very frequent in the land--but not so much so with fevers,
because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had
prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the
nature of the climate--

ALM 46:41 But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the
faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.

ALM 47:0 Amalickiah, by treachery, becomes king of the Lamanites--His awful
wickedness.

ALM 47:1 Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled
with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with
him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the
Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the
Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people,
that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the
Nephites.

ALM 47:2 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among
them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and
they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose
their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them
would not, obey the commandments of the king.

ALM 47:3 And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their
disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army
which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth
and compel them to arms.

ALM 47:4 Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very
subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the
king of the Lamanites.

ALM 47:5 And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who
were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not
obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for
thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and,
supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah,
to the place of arms.

ALM 47:6 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them,
being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be
subjected to go against the Nephites.

ALM 47:7 And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon
the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.

ALM 47:8 Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to
the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor
with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and
dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.

ALM 47:9 And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their
tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.

ALM 47:10 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy
into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the
mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the
mount, for he desired to speak with him.

ALM 47:11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst
not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent
again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that
Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.

ALM 47:12 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get
Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to
Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti,
desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.

ALM 47:13 And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards
to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the
night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given
him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he
would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.

ALM 47:14 And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and
surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day
they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.

ALM 47:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded,
they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their
brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which
Amalickiah desired.

ALM 47:16 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the
commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he
might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king.

ALM 47:17 Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was
killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.

ALM 47:18 And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants
should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died.

ALM 47:19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be
their leader and their chief commander.

ALM 47:20 And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he
had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was
the chief city.

ALM 47:21 And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he supposed
that Amalickiah had fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered
together so great an army to go against the Nephites to battle.

ALM 47:22 But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that
his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed
themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.

ALM 47:23 And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them,
as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they
had taken from the Nephites.

ALM 47:24 And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the
ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth.

ALM 47:25 Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah
raised a cry, saying:

ALM 47:26 Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and
he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and see.

ALM 47:27 And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies should
march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to
the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be
wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue his
servants that they may be slain.

ALM 47:28 And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when they heard
these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king.

ALM 47:29 Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them,
they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over into
the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon.

ALM 47:30 And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued after
them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the hearts of the
people.

ALM 47:31 And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his
armies, and took possession of the city.

ALM 47:32 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the
king was slain--for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her
that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his
army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape--

ALM 47:33 Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto
Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she
also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired him that
he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king.

ALM 47:34 And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew
the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the
place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by
his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify
against them? And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the
king.

ALM 47:35 And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen,
and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of
his cunning servants, he obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king
throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were
composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the
dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.

ALM 47:36 Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same
information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge
of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their
dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and
ferocious than the Lamanites--drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites;
giving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely
forgetting the Lord their God.

ALM 48:0 Amalickiah incites the Lamanites against Nephites--Moroni prepares for
the conflict--A true patriot and a mighty man of God.

ALM 48:1 And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the
kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of
Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers,
against the Nephites.

ALM 48:2 And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch
that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he
having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the
Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people
who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.

ALM 48:3 Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the
hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger,
insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against
the Nephites.

ALM 48:4 For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his
people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage.

ALM 48:5 And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being
the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of
resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to
be chief captains over his armies.

ALM 48:6 And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward
the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.

ALM 48:7 Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining
power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the
minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.

ALM 48:8 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and
erecting small forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round
about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them
about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round
about the land.

ALM 48:9 And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater number of
men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the
Nephites.

ALM 48:10 And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands,
their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto
the Lord their God, and that they might maintain that which was called by their
enemies the cause of Christians.

ALM 48:11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect
understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul
did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from
bondage and slavery;

ALM 48:12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for
the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who
did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.

ALM 48:13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had
sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his
religion, even to the loss of his blood.

ALM 48:14 Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their
enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were
also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except
it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.

ALM 48:15 And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them in
the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in keeping the commandments
of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to
prepare for war, according to their danger;

ALM 48:16 And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they should
go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would
deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it;
not in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea,
in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.

ALM 48:17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were,
and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have
been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of
the children of men.

ALM 48:18 Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and
even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were
all men of God.

ALM 48:19 Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto
the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did
baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words.

ALM 48:20 And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves
because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favored of the Lord, and
thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, yea, even for
the space of four years.

ALM 48:21 But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea,
notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly
to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites.

ALM 48:22 Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many
years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much reluctance.

ALM 48:23 Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because
they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all--they
were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this
world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God.

ALM 48:24 Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that
their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of
those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church,
and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.

ALM 48:25 Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the
blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the
commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they should keep his
commandments they should prosper in the land.

ALM 49:0 The invading Lamanites baffled and repulsed--Amalickiah's wrath over
his failure--Prosperity of the church.

ALM 49:1 And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the nineteenth year,
on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen
approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.

ALM 49:2 And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an
army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to
shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they
fought with stones and with arrows.

ALM 49:3 Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto
you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed
it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would
again become an easy prey for them.

ALM 49:4 But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the
Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that
the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they
might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place
of entrance.

ALM 49:5 Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished
exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of
security.

ALM 49:6 Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the
greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged
to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared
themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared
themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their
nakedness.

ALM 49:7 And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily
overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and
massacre them according to their pleasure.

ALM 49:8 But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for
them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi. Now
they were prepared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the
instructions of Moroni.

ALM 49:9 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were
exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.

ALM 49:10 Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at
the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have
attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for
the blood of his people.

ALM 49:11 But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. And
behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of
Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites,
insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and
they could not come upon them.

ALM 49:12 Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and
marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for
them to come against the Nephites.

ALM 49:13 For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of
security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched
forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief
captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of
that city.

ALM 49:14 But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had
hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong,
yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.

ALM 49:15 And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that
they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had
hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither
to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.

ALM 49:16 And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the
men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in
the valley on the east of the river Sidon.

ALM 49:17 And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found
that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi
exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack
the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.

ALM 49:18 Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security
by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank
which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round
about, save it were by the entrance.

ALM 49:19 And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should
attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones
and arrows at them.

ALM 49:20 Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with
their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come
into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they
prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.

ALM 49:21 And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up
their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the
Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven
back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense
slaughter.

ALM 49:22 Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the
Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they
might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to
fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and
arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by
pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their
dead and wounded bodies.

ALM 49:23 Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the
Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were
all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on
the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.

ALM 49:24 There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the
arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their
shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their
wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.

ALM 49:25 And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief
captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that
they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a
Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss.

ALM 49:26 And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people,
because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected
them to the yoke of bondage.

ALM 49:27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni,
swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni
had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.

ALM 49:28 And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did
thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them
from the hands of their enemies.

ALM 49:29 And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over
the people of Nephi.

ALM 49:30 Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great
prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave
unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and
Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been
ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent
forth to preach among the people.

ALM 50:0 Moroni fortifies the lime between land of Zarahemla and land of
Nephi--Morianton plans to occupy the land northward--he is killed by
Teancum--Pahoran succeeds Nephihah.

ALM 50:1 And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations
for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his
armies should commence in the commencement of the twentieth year of the reign
of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round
about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the
Nephites.

ALM 50:2 And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should
be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about
the cities.

ALM 50:3 And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame
of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.

ALM 50:4 And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of
pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that
the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.

ALM 50:5 And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top
thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who
should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.

ALM 50:6 Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their
enemies, round about every city in all the land.

ALM 50:7 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth
into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites
who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the
land of Zarahemla.

ALM 50:8 And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea
to the west.

ALM 50:9 And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out
of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions,
he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the
land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders
by the seashore, and possess the land.

ALM 50:10 And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their
possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure
their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.

ALM 50:11 And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east
wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites
and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from
the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon--the Nephites possessing
all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land
Bountiful, according to their pleasure.

ALM 50:12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the
assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to
cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their
possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.

ALM 50:13 And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city,
and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it
was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.

ALM 50:14 And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of
Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they
called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.

ALM 50:15 And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the
north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the
north by the borders of the seashore.

ALM 50:16 And thus ended the twentieth year.

ALM 50:17 And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the
commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi.

ALM 50:18 And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich;
yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.

ALM 50:19 And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the
Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can
behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto
Lehi, saying:

ALM 50:20 Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed,
inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But
remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off
from the presence of the Lord.

ALM 50:21 And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of
Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their
murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their
abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars
and their destructions.

ALM 50:22 And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord
were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have
been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in
unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.

ALM 50:23 But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi,
since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in
the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 50:24 And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of
the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.

ALM 50:25 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and fourth
year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the
people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them
concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the
borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.

ALM 50:26 For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim
a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention
between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their
brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.

ALM 50:27 But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the
camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not
in the wrong.

ALM 50:28 And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led
by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to
the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni
should come upon them and destroy them.

ALM 50:29 Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee
to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water,
and take possession of the land which was northward.

ALM 50:30 And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which
would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a
man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and
he fell upon her and beat her much.

ALM 50:31 And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of
Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning
their intentions to flee into the land northward.

ALM 50:32 Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather
Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with
his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land,
which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of
Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.

ALM 50:33 Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of
Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.

ALM 50:34 And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come
to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the
narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea, on
the west and on the east.

ALM 50:35 And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was
led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so
stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and
his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which
Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and
returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of
the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.

ALM 50:36 And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their
covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and
a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also
restored to their lands.

ALM 50:37 And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi
had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died,
having filled the judgment seat with perfect uprightness before God.

ALM 50:38 Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records
and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred;
therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.

ALM 50:39 Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to
fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief
judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge
righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant
unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to
support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to
justice according to their crime.

ALM 50:40 Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of
his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth
year, over the people of Nephi.

ALM 51:0 King-men and freemen--Pahoran, chief judge, is sustained by the
freemen--King-men suppressed--Amalickiah's invasion, defeat, and death.

ALM 51:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and fifth
year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having
established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton
concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in
peace;

ALM 51:2 Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land,
for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge
Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few
particular points of the law should be altered.

ALM 51:3 But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered;
therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their
petitions concerning the altering of the law.

ALM 51:4 Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were
angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the
land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto
bloodshed.

ALM 51:5 And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should
be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were
desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free
government and to establish a king over the land.

ALM 51:6 And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge
over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division
among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights
and the privileges of their religion by a free government.

ALM 51:7 And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled
by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people
came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which
caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people
of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose
but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.

ALM 51:8 Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and
they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and
authority over the people.

ALM 51:9 But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among
the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of
the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was
gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and
preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of
Moroni.

ALM 51:10 But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash;
nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against
the Nephites.

ALM 51:11 Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because
of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but
notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a
wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of
Zarahemla.

ALM 51:12 Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the
Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges;
and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their
contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran.

ALM 51:13 And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had
heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were
glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth
with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not
take up arms to defend their country.

ALM 51:14 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the
Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth
because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much
diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with
anger against them.

ALM 51:15 And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the
people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and
give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or
to put them to death.

ALM 51:16 For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and
dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all
their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the
voice of the people.

ALM 51:17 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go
against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level
them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of
liberty.

ALM 51:18 And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and
they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did
lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn
down and leveled to the earth.

ALM 51:19 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters
who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain
in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their
trials at this period.

ALM 51:20 And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to
the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled
to hoist the title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to
take up arms in defence of their country.

ALM 51:21 And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any
known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the
stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility;
but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and
to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage.

ALM 51:22 Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the
wars and contentions among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and
civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites,
behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the
borders by the seashore.

ALM 51:23 And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in
the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many. And it
came to pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of
all their fortifications.

ALM 51:24 And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of
Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together,
and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle.

ALM 51:25 But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to
go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore,
leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it.

ALM 51:26 And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of
Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of
Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the
east borders by the seashore.

ALM 51:27 And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so
many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified
after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded
strongholds for the Lamanites.

ALM 51:28 And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land
Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many.

ALM 51:29 But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain
Morianton and had headed his people in his flight.

ALM 51:30 And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was
marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land
Bountiful, and also the land northward.

ALM 51:31 But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum
and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed
the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they
did gain advantage over the Lamanites.

ALM 51:32 And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did
slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men
did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did
pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this
manner were they driven.

ALM 51:33 And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his
servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of
Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of their much
fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day.

ALM 51:34 And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the
king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king
immediately that he did not awake his servants.

ALM 51:35 And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men
were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done.

ALM 51:36 And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the
Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them.

ALM 51:37 And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of Amalickiah.

ALM 52:0 Ammoron succeeds Amalickiah--Moroni, with Teancum and Lehi, retakes
city of Mulek and wins great victory--Death of Jacob, the Lamanite general.

ALM 52:1 And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the
first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his
own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that
day.

ALM 52:2 And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they
abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with
all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their
fortifications.

ALM 52:3 And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king
over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of
king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead.

ALM 52:4 And it came to pass that he did command that his people should
maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they
had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood.

ALM 52:5 And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain
those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had
obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum
thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their
forts.

ALM 52:6 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war;
yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up
walls round about and preparing places of resort.

ALM 52:7 And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until Moroni
had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.

ALM 52:8 And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all the
prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had taken many
prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of the Lamanites as a ransom
for those whom the Lamanites had taken.

ALM 52:9 And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the land
Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass which led into the land northward, lest
the Lamanites should obtain that point and should have power to harass them on
every side.

ALM 52:10 And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful
in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every
opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his
power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those
cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify
and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of
the Lamanites.

ALM 52:11 And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the
Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I
go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you.

ALM 52:12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of Zarahemla,
and had made known unto the queen concerning the death of his brother, and had
gathered together a large number of men, and had marched forth against the
Nephites on the borders by the west sea.

ALM 52:13 And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to draw away
a part of their forces to that part of the land, while he had commanded those
whom he had left to possess the cities which he had taken, that they should
also harass the Nephites on the borders by the east sea, and should take
possession of their lands as much as it was in their power, according to the
power of their armies.

ALM 52:14 And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances in the
ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi.

ALM 52:15 But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of the
reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of Moroni--who had
established armies to protect the south and the west borders of the land, and
had begun his march towards the land Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum
with his men in retaking the cities which they had lost--

ALM 52:16 And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make an
attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were possible.

ALM 52:17 And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack
upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites;
but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were
in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and returned again
to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive
strength to his army.

ALM 52:18 And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at the land
of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and seventh year of the reign of
the judges over the people of Nephi.

ALM 52:19 And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni and
Teancum and many of the chief captains held a council of war--what they should
do to cause the Lamanites to come out against them to battle; or that they
might by some means flatter them out of their strongholds, that they might gain
advantage over them and take again the city of Mulek.

ALM 52:20 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites,
which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob,
desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the
plains between the two cities. But behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, would not
come out with his army to meet them upon the plains.

ALM 52:21 And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting them upon
fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that he might decoy the
Lamanites out of their strongholds.

ALM 52:22 Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men
and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in
the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when
the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto
Jacob, their leader.

ALM 52:23 And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth
against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the
smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming
out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.

ALM 52:24 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began to
flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor. And while Teancum was thus
leading away the Lamanites who were pursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni
commanded that a part of his army who were with him should march forth into the
city, and take possession of it.

ALM 52:25 And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to protect
the city, yea, all those who would not yield up their weapons of war.

ALM 52:26 And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek with a part
of his army, while he marched with the remainder to meet the Lamanites when
they should return from the pursuit of Teancum.

ALM 52:27 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum until they
came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met by Lehi and a small army,
which had been left to protect the city Bountiful.

ALM 52:28 And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had beheld
Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much confusion, lest
perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek before Lehi should overtake them;
for they were wearied because of their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.

ALM 52:29 Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear
with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.

ALM 52:30 Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should meet
Moroni and his army.

ALM 52:31 And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated far they
were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on one hand, and the men
of Lehi on the other, all of whom were fresh and full of strength; but the
Lamanites were wearied because of their long march.

ALM 52:32 And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until
they had given up their weapons of war.

ALM 52:33 And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a
Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to
battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.

ALM 52:34 Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined
to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni
and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the
Lamanites.

ALM 52:35 And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding
fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and
Jacob was killed.

ALM 52:36 And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men,
that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the
remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike.

ALM 52:37 Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will
bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear
shedding your blood.

ALM 52:38 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words,
their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down
their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that
they should do the same.

ALM 52:39 But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not
deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were
taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth
into the land Bountiful.

ALM 52:40 And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the
number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on
both sides.

ALM 53:0 City Bountiful fortified--Nephite dissension gives advantage to
enemy--Helaman and his two thousand stripling warriors.

ALM 53:1 And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the
Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also
the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to
guard them while they should perform their labors.

ALM 53:2 And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of
the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been
with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto
Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea, they were beloved by
each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.

ALM 53:3 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying
their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the
land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should
commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city,
Bountiful.

ALM 53:4 And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the
inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the
breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until
they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of
timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.

ALM 53:5 And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and in this
city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall
which they had caused them to build with their own hands. Now Moroni was
compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it was easy to guard them
while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an
attack upon the Lamanites.

ALM 53:6 And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of
the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the
city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the
land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.

ALM 53:7 And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the
Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea,
and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also
delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and
providing food for their armies.

ALM 53:8 And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west
sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some intrigue amongst
the Nephites, which caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground
over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a number
of their cities in that part of the land.

ALM 53:9 And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of
dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most
dangerous circumstances.

ALM 53:10 And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of
Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or
rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and
they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been
protected by the Nephites.

ALM 53:11 And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms
against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed
blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they
would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren,
had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his
brethren had had for them.

ALM 53:12 And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla;
and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.

ALM 53:13 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many
afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved
with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their
country.

ALM 53:14 But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they
were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were
about to break the oath which they had made.

ALM 53:15 And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls;
therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold
their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances
at this time.

ALM 53:16 But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered
into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend
themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves
together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called
themselves Nephites.

ALM 53:17 And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the
Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea,
even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they
would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.

ALM 53:18 Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered
into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.

ALM 53:19 And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the
Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they
took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.

ALM 53:20 And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for
courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all--they
were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.

ALM 53:21 Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught
to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.

ALM 53:22 And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two
thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the
land on the south by the west sea.

ALM 53:23 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

ALM 54:0 Ammoron asks for exchange of prisoners--Moroni grants request upon
conditions--The Lamanite king's angry reply.

ALM 54:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and ninth
year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that he would
exchange prisoners.

ALM 54:2 And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this
request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the support of
the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired
his own people for the strengthening of his army.

ALM 54:3 Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not
a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom
Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as many
prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible.

ALM 54:4 Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron,
the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he
wrote unto Ammoron, saying:

ALM 54:5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning this war
which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy brother hath waged
against them, and which ye are still determined to carry on after his death.

ALM 54:6 Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and
the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and
withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions,
which is the land of Nephi.

ALM 54:7 Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening
unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to
receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and
withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own
lands.

ALM 54:8 But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the
people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.

ALM 54:9 And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and except you
withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the wrath of that God whom
you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction.

ALM 54:10 But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye
withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our
cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of
our God.

ALM 54:11 But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these
things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of hell; therefore I
will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save
it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his
children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will
exchange.

ALM 54:12 And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my
armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against
you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our
first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life;
and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of
the earth.

ALM 54:13 Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to
murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek
to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land,
the land of our first inheritance.

ALM 54:14 Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people of
the Nephites.

ALM 54:15 Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this epistle,
was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words
which he wrote, saying:

ALM 54:16 I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of
Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you,
yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.

ALM 54:17 For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that they
did rob them of their right to the government when it rightly belonged unto
them.

ALM 54:18 And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves
to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I
cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more.

ALM 54:19 Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my
people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.

ALM 54:20 Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your
request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will
wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the subjecting the Nephites to our
authority or to their eternal extinction.

ALM 54:21 And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we
know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a
being, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.

ALM 54:22 And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not
send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have
hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not.

ALM 54:23 I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed
and brought out of Jerusalem.

ALM 54:24 And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been
waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain their rights to the
government; and I close my epistle to Moroni.

ALM 55:0 Moroni, incensed at Ammoron's false assertions, refuses to exchange
prisoners--Strategy secures release of captured Nephites--City of Gid taken
without bloodshed.

ALM 55:1 Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was
more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud;
yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him
to wage a war against the people of Nephi.

ALM 55:2 And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save
he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not
grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.

ALM 55:3 Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom
they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle,
behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death
among them until they shall sue for peace.

ALM 55:4 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he
caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a
man who was a descendant of Laman among them.

ALM 55:5 And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he
was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.

ALM 55:6 Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go
forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.

ALM 55:7 Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni
appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.

ALM 55:8 And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the
Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith
unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite. Behold, we have escaped from the
Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought
with us.

ALM 55:9 Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy;
and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad
that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.

ALM 55:10 But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against
the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink
of the wine;

ALM 55:11 For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and
by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go
against the Nephites.

ALM 55:12 And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.

ALM 55:13 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was
pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was
strong, having been prepared in its strength.

ALM 55:14 And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they
were all drunken.

ALM 55:15 And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and
were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that
had happened.

ALM 55:16 And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had
prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the
Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the
prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;

ALM 55:17 Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as
were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners;
and all those things were done in a profound silence.

ALM 55:18 But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the
Nephites could have slain them.

ALM 55:19 But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in
murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from
destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would
not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.

ALM 55:20 But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of
the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to
gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.

ALM 55:21 And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from
them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.

ALM 55:22 Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the
Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the
Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.

ALM 55:23 And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these
circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with
the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and
they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for
mercy.

ALM 55:24 Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of
war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should
be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were
a great strength to his army.

ALM 55:25 And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had
taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the
fortifications round about the city Gid.

ALM 55:26 And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid,
according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the
city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.

ALM 55:27 And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues
of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and
also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.

ALM 55:28 And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious,
and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.

ALM 55:29 Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night,
but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.

ALM 55:30 And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the
Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.

ALM 55:31 But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God
in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea,
they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the
Lamanite prisoners.

ALM 55:32 And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered
among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a
Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.

ALM 55:33 And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make
preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by
their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding
stronghold.

ALM 55:34 And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and
also new supplies of provisions.

ALM 55:35 And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

ALM 56:0 Helaman's epistle to Moroni--Wonderful faith and valor of the
stripling Ammonites--Another great battle--Nephites victorious.

ALM 56:1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth year of
the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, Moroni received
an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of
the land.

ALM 56:2 And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved
brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare;
behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare
in this part of the land.

ALM 56:3 Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down
out of the land of Nephi--now ye have known that these were descendants of
Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;

ALM 56:4 Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their
unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things--

ALM 56:5 Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these
young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their
leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.

ALM 56:6 And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made,
that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed
blood.

ALM 56:7 But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and
our tribulations for them, they were about to break the covenant which they had
made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.

ALM 56:8 But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which
they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should
not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which they had taken.

ALM 56:9 But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For
behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of
these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye
had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.

ALM 56:10 And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be
called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice
exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because
their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to
mourn.

ALM 56:11 Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have
died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy.

ALM 56:12 And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are
chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they
are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.

ALM 56:13 And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained
possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;

ALM 56:14 The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and
the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.

ALM 56:15 And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the
city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to
fortify the city.

ALM 56:16 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they
had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and
thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.

ALM 56:17 And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die;
therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me,
yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.

ALM 56:18 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had
received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of
Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.

ALM 56:19 And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in
this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus
were we preserved.

ALM 56:20 They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they
had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the commencement of
the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.

ALM 56:21 Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we
were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.

ALM 56:22 And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the
movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to
make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.

ALM 56:23 For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet
them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them
in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were
met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were
disappointed in this our desire.

ALM 56:24 They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they
with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.

ALM 56:25 Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither
durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.

ALM 56:26 And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those
cities which they had taken.

ALM 56:27 And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was
brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.

ALM 56:28 And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of
Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for
them, and also for their wives and their children.

ALM 56:29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and
provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally
forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and
strength.

ALM 56:30 Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise,
we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus
ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, as
if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.

ALM 56:31 And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going
to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.

ALM 56:32 And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our
provisions, to go to that city.

ALM 56:33 And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his
army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city. But he did not march forth
until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.

ALM 56:34 And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of
the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.

ALM 56:35 And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies,
they came forth with their army and marched against us.

ALM 56:36 And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And thus
we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;

ALM 56:37 Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the
army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right
nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as
we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them,
and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.

ALM 56:38 And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his
army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did
Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.

ALM 56:39 And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the
Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with
them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands;
therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.

ALM 56:40 Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should
be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they
should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they
would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness,
even until it was dark.

ALM 56:41 And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we
saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.

ALM 56:42 But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they
halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.

ALM 56:43 And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I
said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that
we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;

ALM 56:44 Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?

ALM 56:45 And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I
seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.

ALM 56:46 For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very
young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he
will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay
our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should
overpower the army of Antipus.

ALM 56:47 Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did
think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives;
yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God
would deliver them.

ALM 56:48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do
not doubt our mothers knew it.

ALM 56:49 And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against
these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had
overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.

ALM 56:50 The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so
short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and
had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.

ALM 56:51 For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because
of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march--therefore
the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began
to give way before the Lamanites.

ALM 56:52 And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to
pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when
Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them
exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned
upon Helaman.

ALM 56:53 Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them
about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the
Lamanites.

ALM 56:54 And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of
Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay
them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war
and also themselves as prisoners of war.

ALM 56:55 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up
unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing
lest there were many of them slain.

ALM 56:56 But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to
the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never
were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such
mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and
for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.

ALM 56:57 And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to
keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land
of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them;
and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took
our march back to the city of Judea.

ALM 57:0 Helaman's epistle continued--Antiparah retaken--City of Cumeni
surrenders--Lamanites driven to Manti--A miraculous preservation--Escape of
Lamanite prisoners.

ALM 57:1 And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the
king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners of war whom we had
taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us.

ALM 57:2 But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were
sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the
prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would
only deliver up our prisoners on exchange.

ALM 57:3 And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners;
therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah.

ALM 57:4 But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their
other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city
of Antiparah fell into our hands.

ALM 57:5 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 57:6 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and ninth
year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army,
from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six
thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join
their brethren, my little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong,
yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us.

ALM 57:7 And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the
army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.

ALM 57:8 And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our
desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did
surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a
supply of provisions.

ALM 57:9 And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many
nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites
could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times;
but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt.

ALM 57:10 At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter
the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites;
therefore, we did take them and their provisions.

ALM 57:11 And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support
after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore
it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to
Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.

ALM 57:12 And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the
Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city
unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city
Cumeni.

ALM 57:13 But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that,
notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our
force to keep them, or to put them to death.

ALM 57:14 For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight
with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their
hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had
surrendered themselves prisoners of war.

ALM 57:15 Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to
their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and
also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people,
notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites.

ALM 57:16 And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious
matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did
resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a
part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down to the land
of Zarahemla.

ALM 57:17 But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now
behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the
Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling
into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of
provisions and also a numerous army of men.

ALM 57:18 And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners
did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.

ALM 57:19 But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most
desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death
unto all those who opposed them.

ALM 57:20 And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the
Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.

ALM 57:21 Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command
with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them;
and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had
taught them.

ALM 57:22 And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been
selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was
they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of
Manti.

ALM 57:23 And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the
sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.

ALM 57:24 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately
gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the
dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.

ALM 57:25 And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two
thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless,
according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the
joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and
neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.

ALM 57:26 And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea,
that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were
slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of
their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe--that there
was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by
his marvelous power.

ALM 57:27 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are
young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God
continually.

ALM 57:28 And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our
wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who
were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners whom they had
started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with.

ALM 57:29 Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to
guard them down to the land.

ALM 57:30 And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did
start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners. And it came to
pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch
the camp of the Lamanites.

ALM 57:31 And they cried unto us, saying--Behold, the armies of the Lamanites
are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them,
yea, and will destroy our people.

ALM 57:32 And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which
caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.

ALM 57:33 And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our
swords should come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in a body run
upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the
remainder of them broke through and fled from us.

ALM 57:34 And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we
took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in
time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.

ALM 57:35 And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies.
And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us;
yea, that has done this great thing for us.

ALM 57:36 Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of
Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in
preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of
them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God.

ALM 58:0 Helaman's epistle concluded--Nephite operations before Manti--A
Lamanite sortie--Gid and Teomner capture the city--Enemy withdraws.

ALM 58:1 And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the
city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the
city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto
done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their strongholds.

ALM 58:2 And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst
not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.

ALM 58:3 Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the
maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions;
therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more
strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.

ALM 58:4 And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of
our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people. And it came to
pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of
Zarahemla.

ALM 58:5 But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also
receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus
were our circumstances at this period of time.

ALM 58:6 And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time,
resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle
with them, because of their retreats and their strongholds.

ALM 58:7 And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult circumstances
for the space of many months, even until we were about to perish for the want
of food.

ALM 58:8 But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us
by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the
assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from
falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was
innumerable.

ALM 58:9 And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they
did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and
also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon
our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.

ALM 58:10 Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would
strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also
give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our
possessions, for the support of our people.

ALM 58:11 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with
assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to
our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should
hope for our deliverance in him.

ALM 58:12 And we did take courage with our small force which we had received,
and were fixed with a determination to conquer our enemies, and to maintain our
lands, and our possessions, and our wives, and our children, and the cause of
our liberty.

ALM 58:13 And thus we did go forth with all our might against the Lamanites,
who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our tents by the wilderness
side, which was near to the city.

ALM 58:14 And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the Lamanites saw
that we were in the borders by the wilderness which was near the city, that
they sent out their spies round about us that they might discover the number
and the strength of our army.

ALM 58:15 And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not strong,
according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut them off from their
support except they should come out to battle against us and kill us, and also
supposing that they could easily destroy us with their numerous hosts,
therefore they began to make preparations to come out against us to battle.

ALM 58:16 And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out
against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of men, should
secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a small number of
men should secrete themselves also in the wilderness.

ALM 58:17 Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the left; and
when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I remained, with the remainder
of my army, in that same place where we had first pitched our tents against the
time that the Lamanites should come out to battle.

ALM 58:18 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their
numerous army against us. And when they had come and were about to fall upon us
with the sword, I caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat
into the wilderness.

ALM 58:19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with great
speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us that they might slay
us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the
midst of Gid and Teomner, insomuch that they were not discovered by the
Lamanites.

ALM 58:20 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or when
the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from their secret places,
and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites that they should not return to the
city.

ALM 58:21 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran to the
city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the city, insomuch that
they did destroy them and did take possession of the city.

ALM 58:22 Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their whole army,
save a few guards only, to be led away into the wilderness.

ALM 58:23 And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had obtained
possession of their strongholds. And it came to pass that we took our course,
after having traveled much in the wilderness towards the land of Zarahemla.

ALM 58:24 And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land
of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead
them on to destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness
again, yea, even back by the same way which they had come.

ALM 58:25 And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for the
chief captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the Nephites were weary
because of their march; and supposing that they had driven their whole army
therefore they took no thought concerning the city of Manti.

ALM 58:26 Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my men
should not sleep, but that they should march forward by another way towards the
land of Manti.

ALM 58:27 And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on the
morrow we were beyond the Lamanites, insomuch that we did arrive before them at
the city of Manti.

ALM 58:28 And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take
possession of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.

ALM 58:29 And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did arrive
near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were astonished
exceedingly and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into the
wilderness.

ALM 58:30 Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did flee
out of all this quarter of the land. But behold, they have carried with them
many women and children out of the land.

ALM 58:31 And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them
are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and
our children are returning to their homes, all save it be those who have been
taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites.

ALM 58:32 But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a number of
cities and so great possessions.

ALM 58:33 But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over those
lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and those lands, which were
our own.

ALM 58:34 Now we do not know the cause that the government does not grant us
more strength; neither do those men who came up unto us know why we have not
received greater strength.

ALM 58:35 Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye have
drawn away the forces into that quarter of the land; if so, we do not desire to
murmur.

ALM 58:36 And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction in
the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance; for we know
that they are more numerous than that which they have sent.

ALM 58:37 But, behold, it mattereth not--we trust God will deliver us,
not-withstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us out of the
hands of our enemies.

ALM 58:38 Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we
are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of
Nephi.

ALM 58:39 And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so highly
spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord has supported them, yea,
and kept them from falling by the sword, insomuch that even one soul has not
been slain.

ALM 58:40 But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they stand
fast in that liberty where-with God has made them free; and they are strict to
remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his
statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith
is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come.

ALM 58:41 And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has
redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his presence; yea, and
may he favor this people, even that ye may have success in obtaining the
possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for
our support. And now, behold, I close mine epistle. I am Helaman, the son of
Alma.

ALM 59:0 Moroni writes to Pahoran, asking reenforcements to Helaman--City of
Nephihah taken by Lamanites--Moroni's anger at seeming indifference of the
government.

ALM 59:1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi, after Moroni had received and had read Helaman's
epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding
success which Helaman had had, in obtaining those lands which were lost.

ALM 59:2 Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the land
round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.

ALM 59:3 And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to Pahoran,
desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen
Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain
that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.

ALM 59:4 And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of
Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might obtain the remainder of
those possessions and cities which the Lamanites had taken from them.

ALM 59:5 And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making preparations to
go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of Nephihah, who were
gathered together from the city of Moroni and the city of Lehi and the city of
Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.

ALM 59:6 Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land of Manti,
and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this
part of the land.

ALM 59:7 And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving strength from
day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth against the people of
Nephihah, and they did begin to slay them with an exceedingly great slaughter.

ALM 59:8 And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the people of
Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and joined the
army of Moroni.

ALM 59:9 And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to the
city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and
knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the
Lamanites than to retake it from them, he supposed that they would easily
maintain that city.

ALM 59:10 Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places which he
had recovered.

ALM 59:11 And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost he was
exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the wickedness of the
people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren.

ALM 59:12 Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted and
marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the
success of the Lamanites over them.

ALM 59:13 And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government,
because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country.

ALM 60:0 Moroni's second epistle to Pahoran--Complains of neglect--Demands
immediate help on peril of reprisal.

ALM 60:1 And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the land,
who was Pahoran, and these are the words which he wrote, saying: Behold, I
direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, who is the chief
judge and the governor over the land, and also to all those who have been
chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war.

ALM 60:2 For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of
condemnation; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been appointed to
gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all
manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites,
in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.

ALM 60:3 And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also
Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great sufferings; yea, even
hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every kind.

ALM 60:4 But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur nor
complain.

ALM 60:5 But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people; yea,
thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have otherwise been if ye
had rendered unto our armies sufficient strength and succor for them. Yea,
great has been your neglect towards us.

ALM 60:6 And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this exceedingly great
neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of your thoughtless state.

ALM 60:7 Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of thoughtless
stupor, while your enemies are spreading the work of death around you? Yea,
while they are murdering thousands of your brethren--

ALM 60:8 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have
placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have
sent armies unto them, to have strengthened them, and have saved thousands of
them from falling by the sword.

ALM 60:9 But behold, this is not all--ye have withheld your provisions from
them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their
great desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they
have done when they were about to perish with hunger, because of your
exceedingly great neglect towards them.

ALM 60:10 And now, my beloved brethren--for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye
ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the
freedom of this people; but behold, ye have neglected them insomuch that the
blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known
unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings--

ALM 60:11 Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and
because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would
deliver you? Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain.

ALM 60:12 Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have been killed
it is because of their wickedness? I say unto you, if ye have supposed this ye
have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen by
the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;

ALM 60:13 For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and
judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the
righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the
rest of the Lord their God.

ALM 60:14 And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments
of God will come upon this people, because of their exceeding slothfulness,
yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and their exceedingly great
neglect towards their brethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.

ALM 60:15 For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head,
we could have withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over
us.

ALM 60:16 Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among ourselves;
yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so much bloodshed among
ourselves; yea, at the time we were contending among ourselves, if we had
united our strength as we hitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the
desire of power and authority which those king-men had over us; had they been
true to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone forth against
our enemies, instead of taking up their swords against us, which was the cause
of so much bloodshed among ourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in
the strength of the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would
have been done, according to the fulfilling of his word.

ALM 60:17 But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking possession
of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women
and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they
should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great
wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those
king-men.

ALM 60:18 But why should I say much concerning this matter? For we know not but
what ye yourselves are seeking for authority. We know not but what ye are also
traitors to your country.

ALM 60:19 Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the heart of our
country and ye are surrounded by security, that ye do not cause food to be sent
unto us, and also men to strengthen our armies?

ALM 60:20 Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? Yea, have ye
forgotten the captivity of our fathers? Have ye forgotten the many times we
have been delivered out of the hands of our enemies?

ALM 60:21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while we sit
upon our thrones and do not make use of the means which the Lord has provided
for us?

ALM 60:22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with thousands
of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit in idleness, while there
are thousands round about in the borders of the land who are falling by the
sword, yea, wounded and bleeding?

ALM 60:23 Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit
still and behold these things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye
should remember that God has said that the inward vessel shall be cleansed
first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.

ALM 60:24 And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and begin to
be up and doing, and send forth food and men unto us, and also unto Helaman,
that he may support those parts of our country which he has regained, and that
we may also recover the remainder of our possessions in these parts, behold it
will be expedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we have
first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, even the great head of our government.

ALM 60:25 And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto me a
true spirit of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify our armies, and
grant unto them food for their support, behold I will leave a part of my
freemen to maintain this part of our land, and I will leave the strength and
the blessings of God upon them, that none other power can operate against
them--

ALM 60:26 And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience in
their tribulations--

ALM 60:27 And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a
desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold
I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who have desires to
usurp power and authority shall become extinct.

ALM 60:28 Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my
God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments that I do take my
sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of your iniquity
that we have suffered so much loss.

ALM 60:29 Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do
bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones, the
sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit
you even to your utter destruction.

ALM 60:30 Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do administer
unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and
smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the
progress of this people in the cause of our freedom.

ALM 60:31 For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and wax
strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.

ALM 60:32 Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come out in
judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the tradition of their fathers that
has caused their hatred, yea, and it has been redoubled by those who have
dissented from us, while your iniquity is for the cause of your love of glory
and the vain things of the world?

ALM 60:33 Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye
do trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom
ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye
shall go up to battle against them.

ALM 60:34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the covenant
which I have made to keep the commandments of my God; therefore I would that ye
should adhere to the word of God, and send speedily unto me of your provisions
and of your men, and also to Helaman.

ALM 60:35 And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for
behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with hunger; therefore he
will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the sword. Now see that
ye fulfil the word of God.

ALM 60:36 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain. I seek not for power, but to
pull it down. I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God,
and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I close mine epistle.

ALM 61:0 Pahoran's patriotic reply--He exonerates himself and the
freemen--Nephite state tottering--Governor appeals for military aid against
rebels.

ALM 61:1 Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his
epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from Pahoran, the chief
governor. And these are the words which he received:

ALM 61:2 I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these
words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you,
Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.

ALM 61:3 But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea,
insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and also those of my
people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly
numerous.

ALM 61:4 And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me
that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great
flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the
cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have
daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.

ALM 61:5 And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to
the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I could get.

ALM 61:6 And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the
land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defence
of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.

ALM 61:7 And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in
rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us
and durst not come out against us to battle.

ALM 61:8 They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they
have appointed a king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the
Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which
alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he
supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and
he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the
Lamanites.

ALM 61:9 And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I
am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not
seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the
rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in
the which God hath made us free.

ALM 61:10 And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We
would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.

ALM 61:11 We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up
in rebellion and take the sword against us.

ALM 61:12 We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were
requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.

ALM 61:13 But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to
our enemies, but that we should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us.

ALM 61:14 Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and
whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and
dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our
freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the
cause of our Redeemer and our God.

ALM 61:15 Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and leave
the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to
conduct the war in that part of the land, according to the Spirit of God, which
is also the spirit of freedom which is in them.

ALM 61:16 Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not
perish until ye can come unto me.

ALM 61:17 Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and
we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the strength of our God
according to the faith which is in us.

ALM 61:18 And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may
obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth
against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great
iniquity.

ALM 61:19 And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was
somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us
to go against our brethren.

ALM 61:20 But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you that
ye should go against them.

ALM 61:21 See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to
fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in
that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to
my beloved brother, Moroni.

ALM 62:0 Moroni marches to relief of Pahoran--Zarahemla recaptured from the
rebels--Help sent to Helaman, Lehi, and Teancum--Lamanites concentrate in the
land of Moroni--Teancum slays Ammoron, at cost of his own life--Lamanites
driven out of the land.

ALM 62:1 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle his
heart did take courage, and was filled with exceedingly great joy because of
the faithfulness of Pahoran, that he was not also a traitor to the freedom and
cause of his country.

ALM 62:2 But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those who
had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who
had rebelled against their country and also their God.

ALM 62:3 And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according
to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder
of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.

ALM 62:4 And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did
enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land
of Gideon.

ALM 62:5 And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his standard, and
did take up their swords in the defence of their freedom, that they might not
come into bondage.

ALM 62:6 And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in
all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those
of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of
Pachus, who was the king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen out of
the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.

ALM 62:7 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their
armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did
meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.

ALM 62:8 And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and
Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.

ALM 62:9 And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and
also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were
executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men,
whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would
fight against it, were put to death.

ALM 62:10 And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly
observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying
their freedom was speedily executed according to the law.

ALM 62:11 And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the
people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of
Zarahemla, among their own people, having inflicted death upon all those who
were not true to the cause of freedom.

ALM 62:12 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and first year
of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused
that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be
sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.

ALM 62:13 And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a
sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum.
And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the
Lamanites.

ALM 62:14 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large body of
men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a large body of men towards
the land of Nephihah, being determined to overthrow the Lamanites in that city.

ALM 62:15 And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they
took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took
their provisions and their weapons of war.

ALM 62:16 And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to
enter into a covenant that they would no more take up their weapons of war
against the Nephites.

ALM 62:17 And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to dwell
with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had
not been slain.

ALM 62:18 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued
their march towards the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they
had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of
Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.

ALM 62:19 Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle
against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly
great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they
durst not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in that
day.

ALM 62:20 And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the
night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city
the Lamanites did camp with their army.

ALM 62:21 And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and
they were all asleep. And now Moroni returned to his army, and caused that they
should prepare in haste strong cords and ladders, to be let down from the top
of the wall into the inner part of the wall.

ALM 62:22 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march
forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part
of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their
armies.

ALM 62:23 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by
night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the
morning came they were all within the walls of the city.

ALM 62:24 And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni
were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did
flee out by the pass.

ALM 62:25 And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did
cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and
surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled
into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.

ALM 62:26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of
Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who
were slain.

ALM 62:27 Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were prisoners
were desirous to join the people of Ammon and become a free people.

ALM 62:28 And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them it was
granted according to their desires.

ALM 62:29 Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the people of
Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the ground, raising all
manner of grain, and flocks and herds of every kind; and thus were the Nephites
relieved from a great burden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all
the prisoners of the Lamanites.

ALM 62:30 Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of
the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies
of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had
been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly;
therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi.

ALM 62:31 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was
coming against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of
Moroni.

ALM 62:32 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army did pursue them from
city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites fled
from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they
came to the land of Moroni.

ALM 62:33 And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch
that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni. Now Ammoron, the king of
the Lamanites, was also with them.

ALM 62:34 And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with
their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that
the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the
south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.

ALM 62:35 And thus they did encamp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and
the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore
they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were
Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered
that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great and
lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much
war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.

ALM 62:36 And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the
camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city. And
he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the
king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart.
But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they
did pursue Teancum, and slew him.

ALM 62:37 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was
dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had
fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had
suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and
had gone the way of all the earth.

ALM 62:38 Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came
upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter;
and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did
not return at that time against the Nephites.

ALM 62:39 And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and bloodsheds, and
famine, and affliction, for the space of many years.

ALM 62:40 And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions, and all
manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi; nevertheless for the righteous'
sake, yea, because of the prayers of the righteous, they were spared.

ALM 62:41 But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the war
between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become hardened, because of the
exceedingly great length of the war; and many were softened because of their
afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God, even in the
depth of humility.

ALM 62:42 And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of
the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently
strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the
place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the
people of Nephi.

ALM 62:43 And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his
son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might
spend the remainder of his days in peace.

ALM 62:44 And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did take
upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God; for because of so
many wars and contentions it had become expedient that a regulation should be
made again in the church.

ALM 62:45 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did declare the
word of God with much power unto the convincing of many people of their
wickedness, which did cause them to repent of their sins and to be baptized
unto the Lord their God.

ALM 62:46 And it came to pass that they did establish again the church of God,
throughout all the land.

ALM 62:47 Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law. And their judges,
and their chief judges were chosen.

ALM 62:48 And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land, and began
to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the land. And they began to
grow exceedingly rich.

ALM 62:49 But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their
prosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes; neither were
they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they did humble themselves
exceedingly before him.

ALM 62:50 Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for them,
that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and from prisons, and
from all manner of afflictions, and he had delivered them out of the hands of
their enemies.

ALM 62:51 And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually, insomuch that
the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so that they did wax strong and
prosper in the land.

ALM 62:52 And it came to pass that all these things were done. And Helaman
died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people
of Nephi.

ALM 63:0 Shiblon succeeds Helaman--Death of Moroni--Hagoth, builder of
ships--Nephite voyages to the land northward--Helaman, son of Helaman, keeps
the records--Moronihah defeats Lamanites--End of Alma's account.

ALM 63:1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and sixth year
of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Shiblon took
possession of those sacred things which had been delivered unto Helaman by
Alma.

ALM 63:2 And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God; and he
did observe to do good continually, to keep the commandments of the Lord his
God; and also did his brother.

ALM 63:3 And it came to pass that Moroni died also. And thus ended the thirty
and sixth year of the reign of the judges.

ALM 63:4 And it came to pass that in the thirty and seventh year of the reign
of the judges, there was a large company of men, even to the amount of five
thousand and four hundred men, with their wives and their children, departed
out of the land of Zarahemla into the land which was northward.

ALM 63:5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man,
therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders
of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the
west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.

ALM 63:6 And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter therein and
did sail forth with much provisions, and also many women and children; and they
took their course northward. And thus ended the thirty and seventh year.

ALM 63:7 And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships. And the
first ship did also return, and many more people did enter into it; and they
also took much provisions, and set out again to the land northward.

ALM 63:8 And it came to pass that they were never heard of more. And we suppose
that they were drowned in the depths of the sea. And it came to pass that one
other ship also did sail forth; and whither she did go we know not.

ALM 63:9 And it came to pass that in this year there were many people who went
forth into the land northward. And thus ended the thirty and eighth year.

ALM 63:10 And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the
judges, Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to the land northward
in a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the people who had gone forth into
that land.

ALM 63:11 Therefore it became expedient for Shiblon to confer those sacred
things, before his death, upon the son of Helaman, who was called Helaman,
being called after the name of his father.

ALM 63:12 Now behold, all those engravings which were in the possession of
Helaman were written and sent forth among the children of men throughout all
the land, save it were those parts which had been commanded by Alma should not
go forth.

ALM 63:13 Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and handed down
from one generation to another; therefore, in this year, they had been
conferred upon Helaman, before the death of Shiblon.

ALM 63:14 And it came to pass also in this year that there were some dissenters
who had gone forth unto the Lamanites; and they were stirred up again to anger
against the Nephites.

ALM 63:15 And also in this same year they came down with a numerous army to war
against the people of Moronihah, or against the army of Moronihah, in the which
they were beaten and driven back again to their own lands, suffering great
loss.

ALM 63:16 And thus ended the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the judges
over the people of Nephi.

ALM 63:17 And thus ended the account of Alma, and Helaman his son, and also
Shiblon, who was his son.
