          COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF THE ORDER
                      AND
           NUMBER OF BOOKS OF THE BIBLE
  The original sequence of the books of the Bible differ 
somewhat from the sequence that is presently found in the 
English Bible. The original* text had the following order:
1. Genesis  12.Isa     23.Zep    34.Esth    45.James      
2. Exodus   13.Jer     24.Hag    35.Dan     46.I Peter    
3. Lev      14.Ezek    25.Zech   36.Ezra    47.II Peter   
4. Numbers  15.Hosea   26.Mal    37.Nehem   48.I John     
5. Deut     16.Joel    27.Psa    38.I  Chr  49.II John
6. Joshua   17.Amos    28.Prov   39.II Chr  50.III John   
7. Judges   18.Obad    29.Job    40.Matt    51.Jude       
8. I Sam    19.Jonah   30.Song   41.Mark    52.Romans     
9. II Sam   20.Micah   31.Ruth   42.John    53.I Cor
                   56.Eph       62.I Tim
                   57.Phile     63.II Tim
                   58.Col       64.Titus
                   59.I Thes    65.Phil
                   60.II Ths    66.Revelation
                   61.Hebrews   
* Original means the Oldest or most original that were 
known to the world, at this time.
  Some of the books assign themselves, either totally or in 
part to a particular scribe's name, while others are 
anonymous. The books which reveal (in part or totally) the 
scribe's identity are :
     Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy ascribe 
themselves to Moses and are ascribed to Moses in other 
books of the Bible. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the 12 
minor Prophets ascribe themselves to the scribes whose name 
the book bears. Psalms is ascribed to David. Proverbs and 
Song of Solomon ascribe themselves to Solomon and 
Ecclesiastes ascribes itself only to the "son of David" 
which most believe to be Solomon. Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah 
ascribe themselves to these respective scribes. James, 1 
and 2 Peter and Jude bear the names of their respective 
scribe. The Epistles of Paul ascribe themselves, with the 
exception of Hebrews, to Paul. Revelation ascribes itself 
to John.
     The anonymous books, therefore, are : Genesis, Joshua, 
Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, Job, Ruth, 
Lamentations, Esther, 1 and 2 Chronicles, Matthew, Mark, 
Luke, John, Acts, 2 and 3 John, and Hebrews.
     Moses has 4, Solomon 3, Peter 2, Paul 13. The other 
identified scribes have one book each.
     The number 66 is 6 -11's (Feature 1). The anonymous 
books are 22 or 2-11's. The non-anonymous books are 44 or 
4-11's (Feature 2). Of these 44,  22 (or 2-11's) belong to 
writers of more than one book and 22 (again 2-11's) belong 
to writers of only one book (Feature 3). The sum of the 66 
numbers totals 2,211 or 201-11's. We can divide this number 
in this manner: the 22 books of the writers of more than 
one book have 946 (or 86-11's), while the other 44 have 
1,265 (or 115-11's) (Feature 4).
     Of the 66 books, 21 are Epistles. Their numbers are 
(James to Philemon or 45 to 65). The sum 2,21 for the 66 
books can be divided between Epistles and Non-Epistles. The 
Epistles have 1,155 (or 105-11's) and the non-epistles have 
1,056 (or 96-11's) (Feature 5).
     Moses, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, Joel and Daniel 
are expressly quoted in the New Testament. The number of 
their respective books are 2,3,4,5,12,13,15,16,27,35. The 
total sum of these books is  (Feature 6) 132 (or 12-11's).
The Numeric Values of the Bible Writer's names are:
Moses      345  Isaiah     401   Jeremiah   271   
Hosea      381  Joel        47   Amos       176   
Jonah       71  Micah       75   Nahum      104   
Zephaniah  235  Zechariah  242   Malachi    101   
Solomon    375  Daniel      95   Ezra       278   
James      833  Haggai      21   Peter      755   
Paul       781  John       781   John      1069   
Ezekiel    156  Obadiah     91   Habbakuk   216
David       14  Nehemiah   113   Jude       685                
                              
     The total sum of these is 7,931  -  which is 11 X 7 X 
103. Just to show you that can also be expressed as 721-
11's, while the sum of the factors 7, 11, 103 is 121 or 11-
11's (Features 7 and 8).
     There may be some that may claim that this could be 
accidental or by design. The the number of books in the 
Bible should be a multiple of 11 could possibly be 
accidental; However, since only every 11th number is a 
multiple of 11, then THE CHANCH OF ACCIDENT IS 1 IN 11!
     That this number can be divided between anonymous and 
non anonymous books in such manner as to be multiples of 11 
could also be accident; However, THE CHANCH IS 1 IN 11 
TIMES 11 or ONE CHANCH IN 121!
     That this number can be divided between the non 
anonymous by 11's among the authors of only one book and 
those of more than one book could also be accidental; 
However, the chanch for it being accident is ONE IN 11 
TIMES 11 TIMES 11 or ONE CHANCH IN 1,331.
     If we carry out the progressions through the eight 
occurances proven above, we concede that each one could be 
accidental; However, the chanch for them all being so 
becomes ONE CHANCH IN 11 TO THE EIGTH POWER  or ONE IN 
214,358,881!!!!
      Using our pencil and a lot more paper, we find:
     The sum of the numeric values of the 26 authors named 
as Biblical writers which was shown above as 7931 is a 
multiple of seven  (Feature 9) as well as eleven . The sums 
of the numeric values of the 26 writers (7,931) is a 
multiple of 11. Of this number the 21 writers of the Old 
testament (3-7's) have 3,808 or 544-7's and the new 
Testament writers have  (Feature 10) 4,123 or 589-7's. of 
the 3,808 belonging to the Old Testament, 2,933 or 419-7's 
belong to the writers of the Law and the Prophets, from 
Moses to Malachi, and 1,190 or 170-7's belong to the 
writers of the hagiographa, from David to Nehemiah (Feature 
11). Seven of the 21 Old Testament writers (3-7's) are 
expressly named in the New Testament; These are Moses, 
David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Hosea, Joel. Their numeric 
value is 1,554 or 222-7's (Features 12 & 13). The numeric 
value of Moses who heads the list and John who closes it, 
345 and 1069 equal 1414 or 202-7's (Feature 14)
     The Bible begins with the Hebrew word "beginning" and 
ends with the Greek word "saint". The Hebrew word occurs in 
the following books: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, 
Deuteronomy, 1 Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, 
Amos, Micah, Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes, Daniel, 
Nehemiah and 2 Chronicles. The Greek word occurs in 
Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 
Jude, Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, 
Philemon and Revelation. These books total 42 or 6-7's. 
take the number of these books in the order of their 
respective place and the sum is 1575 or 225-7's.
The possibility of these eight features of SEVEN and the 
eight  features of ELEVEN occuring together is ONE IN 
5,764,801 TIMES 214,358,881 or ONE IN ONE THOUSAND MILLION 
MILLIONS !!
It would be IMPOSSIBLE, therefore to claim accident or 
conspiracy in the phenomena indicated. The above clearly 
demonstrates the design of:
1. THE NUMBER AND ORDER OF BOOKS AS RECEIVED. * feature 1*
2. THE PROPORTION BETWEEN ANONYMOUS AND NON-ANONYMOUS BOOKS 
   *2*
3. THE  PROPORTION BETWEEN BOOKS WRITTEN BY AN AUTHOR OF  A 
   SINGLE  BOOK  AND THOSE WRITTEN BY AUTHORS OF MORE  THAN 
   ONE BOOK. *3 & 4*
4. THE PROPORTION BETWEEN EPISTLE AND NON EPISTLE BOOKS. *5*
5. THE NUMBER OF O.T. WRITERS QUOTED IN THE N.T. *6*
     The Bible was written by some thirty different writers 
from many different walks of life over a period of sixteen 
hundred years between its first and last writers. If we 
assume that it was exclusively written by HUMAN hands, we 
cannot account for the mathmatic phenomena demonstrated. If 
we assume that a SUPERIOR MATHMATICAL MIND (The Mathmatical 
Author of Nature) has planned these phenomena, provides an 
immediate and rational explanation of these phenomena and 
others found in the Bible.
     It is not the desire of this report to provide 
anything other than an insight into the immeasurable 
intelligence that produced the Bible. The same intelligence 
that produced the limitless stretches of space, that 
produced the smallest one cell creature, the same one that 
created it ALL, is the only source that could have produced 
the Bible as it presently stands.
