        Praying the Rosary:  The Essence of Christian Mysticism

 Some time ago, I promised to send my complete list of Rosaries.
Previously, I sent out about 1/3 of the different kinds of Rosaries
I've collected.  Here is the complete list.  It is a _long_ file.

 Enjoy!

 Herein is a compilation of many different Rosaries of the Church.

NOTE:  Some in the list appear to be duplications; they are sometimes
       very similar but are not exactly the same.

                      Beads for the Dead

 Beads for the Dead.  This rosary consists of four decades (40 beads)
in memory of the forty hours which Our Lord is thought to have spent
in Limbo.  There are also the 5 introductory beads as on the Dominican
Rosary.

 One begins and ends this chaplet with the De profundis or an Our
Father and Hail Mary.  On the large beads is made acts of faith, hope,
and charity.  On each small bead is said:  "Sweet Heart of Mary, be my
salvation."  Each decade is concluded with:  "Eternal rest grant unto
them, etc."

 Compilers note:  I gather the complete final prayer is as follows:

V.  Eternal rest grant unto him/her, O Lord.
R.  And let perpetual light shine upon him/her.

V.  May he/she rest in peace.
R.  Amen.

V.  May his/her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed,
    through the mercy of God, rest in peace.
R.  Amen.

<All make the sign of the Cross>

May the love of God and the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ bless us
and console us and gently wipe every tear from our eyes:  in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
R.  Amen.

                       Blessed Sacrament Beads

 Blessed Sacrament Beads (Blessed Sacrament Fathers).  These consist
of a medal of the Blessed Sacrament and 33 beads, recalling the 33
years of Christ's life on earth.

 On the medal one makes a spiritual communion as follows:  "As I
cannot now receive Thee, my Jesus, in Holy Communion, come,
spiritually into my heart, and make it Thine own forever."

 On each bead say:  "Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament have mercy on us!"

 This information is quoted from TWENTY-FOUR ROSARIES AND CHAPLETS by
Patrick Shaughnessy, O.S.B., S.T.D.  Reprinted 1984 by Our Lady's
Rosary Makers.

 Approved May 30, 1911 by Pope Pius X (The Holy Father has granted to
the entire world 300 days indulgence each time the above prayer is
recited.)

 From the card that came with the Rosary.

 On the back of the Spiritual Communion Medal is the following:

 JESUS IN THE BLESSED SACRAMENT ON THE ALTER, HAVE MERCY ON US
 300 DAYS INDULGENCE

                   The Brigittine Rosary

 The Brigittin Rosary (Brigittine Fathers).  The Brigittine Rosary
consists of 6 decades of 10 beads each.  There are 3 additional beads
at the end.  Each decade consists of 1 Our Father, 10 Hail Marys.  The
Apostle's Creed is said on the crucifix.

 The 63 Hail Marys are in remembrance of the 63 years of Mary's
earthly life according to one traditional account.  The 7 Our Fathers,
said on the large beads between each decade, are in remembrance of the
Seven Sorrows and Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin.

                         CHAPLET OF FAITH

On each decade of the rosary pray:

   on large bead:         One Apostles Creed --
   on 10 small beads:     Jesus, Mary, I love you, save souls,
                          save the consecrated --
   at the ends, 5 times:  Hail Holy Queen.

                            Chotki

 Eastern Orthodox rosary.  This Oriental form of rosary is known in
the Hellenic Greek Church as Chaplet or String of Knots of Beads, in
the Russian Church as Vervitza (string), chotki (chaplet), or
liestovka (ladder), and the the Rumanian Church as matanie
(reverence).  Our everyday name of "beads" for it is simply the Old
Saxon word "bede" (a prayer) which has been transferred to the
instrument used in reciting the prayer, while the word rosary is an
equally modern term.

 The Rosary prayed by the Eastern Orthodox is a string of 33, 100, or
300 beads on a string or knots made of wool; they are not divided into
decades. On each bead or knot is prayed the following mantra:  "Lord
Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on me, a sinner."  The
modern Chotki, as it is known, calls for a slightly different mantra:
Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner."  Having
prayed both versions, I can attest that the latter is easier.  Both this
mantra and the Glorious mantra above are derived from the Gospel story
of the Pharisee and the tax collector.  (The Hail Mary, of course,
comes from the Angelic Salutation coupled with a later additional
prayer.)  That's about all I know about the Eastern Orthodox Rosary.

 I've learned from some sources that lay Orthodox do not pray the
Rosary or Chotki but that it is pretty much exclusively in the domain
of monastics.  However, from other sources I have learned that the
Chotki is quite popular among the laity.  I believe, therefore, that
it may depend upon the Eastern denomination.  For what it's worth, I
obtained my Chotki from Eastern Christian Supply through a
Byzantine Church.

                        Corona of Mercy

         (For private recitation upon the Rosary beads)

 Our Father....Hail Mary....Creed

 On the large beads:

 "Eternal Father, I offer Thee the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity
of Thy Most Beloved Son and Our Lord Jesus Christ in atonement for our
sins and the sins of the whole world."

 On the small beads:

 "Through the sorrowful passion of Jesus show mercy unto us and to all
the world."  (ten times)

 (The same is repeated for every decade of the Rosary and is to be
joined with meditation on the mystery of each individual decade.)  In
conclusion add:  "Holy God, Holy Omnipotent, Holy Immortal, have mercy
on us."  (3 times)

                        Crosier Beads

 Crosier Beads (Crosier Fathers).  This is the same as the ordinary 5
decade Dominican Rosary.  It is merely a question of the indulgences
attached to the beads.

 On August 20th, 1516, Pope Leo X granted to all the faithful an
indulgence of 500 days for every Our Father or Hail mary said with
devotion on the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary blessed by the
General of the Crosier Fathers.  This was extended later to all
priests applying to the Congregation of Indulgences by Pope Pius X.

 Any Catholic possessing a rosary having this indulgence can gain the
indulgence by reciting an Our Father or Hail Mary.  No prayer imposed
as a confessional penance, however, can gain the indulgence of the
Crosier blessing.

 There is no obligation to meditate on the mysteries of the Passion.

 The Rosary must be held in the hand to gain the indulgence.

 The indulgence is applicable to the Souls in Purgatory.

                      The Crown of Our Lord

                         (Camaldolese)

 The Crown of Our Lord consists of 33 beads -- 3 decades and 3
additional beads commemorating the 33 years of the earthly life of Our
Lord.  There are two methods of reciting this crown.  The first method
is as follows:  Having made the sign of the cross say:  "O God incline
unto my aid; O Lord make haste to help me."  The mystery is then
announced, e.g., "Jesus, Who sweat blood for us, etc."  Then follow
1 Hail Mary, 10 Our Fathers, and 1 Glory Be.  These are all to be
repeated 3 times.  Then add 1 Hail Mary, 3 Our Fathers, and another
Hail Mary.  The 5 Hail Marys are to commemorate the Five Holy Wounds.

 The second method consists of meditating on an event from the life or
passion of Our Lord while saying the prescribed Our Father or Hail
Mary.

                      Chaplet of the Divine Mercy

           (for private recitation on ordinary rosary beads)

Begin with:

     Our Father...., Hail Mary...., Apostles Creed.

Then, on the OUR FATHER BEADS, pray:

        Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and Blood, Soul and
        Divinity of your dearly beloved Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ,
        in atonement for our sins and those of the whole world.

On the HAIL MARY BEADS, pray:

        For the sake of his sorrowful Passion have mercy on us
        and on the whole world.

In conclusion, THREE TIMES, pray:

        Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us
        and on the whole world.


(From the Diary of the Servant of God Sr. Faustina -- Note Book I,
page 197.)

An inner voice taught Sister M. Faustina Kowalska of the Congregation
of the Sisters of Our Lady of Mercy (the Apostle of Divine Mercy and
the Servant of God) the above chaplet rosary.  Jesus later said to
Sister Faustina:  "Say unceasingly this chaplet that I have taught
you.  Anyone who says it will receive great Mercy at the hour of
death.  Priests will recommend it to sinners as the last hope.  Even
the most hardened sinner, if he recites this Chaplet even once, will
receive grace from My infinite Mercy.  I want the whole world to know
My infinite Mercy.  I want to give unimaginable graces to those who
trust in My Mercy."

                    Chaplet of the Five Wounds of God

 Chaplet of the Five Wounds of God (Passionist).  This chaplet
consists of 5 groups of 5 beads each.  For each bead, pray one Glory
Be and one Hail Mary for the Sorrowful Virgin.  As one prays each
group, one meditates on the Wounds of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.  Variation:  Invocations in honor of the Holy Wounds of Our
Lord Jesus Christ.  On the large beads pray:  "Eternal Father, I offer
Thee the Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ to heal the wounds of our
souls.  Amen."  One the small beads pray:  "My Jesus, pardon and mercy
through the merits of Thy Sacred Wounds.  Amen."

 Medals are usually attached to the beads or 3 beads are added at the
beginning of the chaplet.  These medals display the Wounds of Christ
on one side and Our Lady of Sorrows on the other.  The medals are not
necessary either for blessing or for obtaining the indulgences.  The
medals are ordinarily arranged so that one meditates first on the
Wound in the left foot of Our Lord, then the Wound in the right foot,
the left hand, the right hand, and finally the Wound in the sacred
side of Jesus.

 The earliest mention of the Rosary of the Five Wounds of God is found
in a document dating back to 1821.  The Platea of Saints John and
Paul, at Rome, relates "The Most Rev. Fr. General, acting in
accordance with our spirit to promote devotion to the Passion of Our
Lord, obtained permission to bless the Chaplet of the Five Wounds, at
the same time enriching it with indulgences."  This chaplet was first
approved by a decree of Pius VII dated Jan. 22, 1822.

 Some Christians may wish to pray different mantras in place of the
Hail Marys.  Here are some suggestions:

Heavenly Mysteries:    O Jesus, Son of Mary, have mercy on us.

                       Holy God, Holy and Mighty,
                         Holy Immortal One,
                         have mercy on us.

Revelation Mysteries:  O Jesus, glory of Israel, light to the
                          Gentiles, have mercy on us.

                       Holy Trinity, One God, have mercy on us.

Teaching Mysteries:    O Divine Master, make us instruments of your
                          peace; let us sow faith, hope, and love, and
                          the joy of dying into eternal life.

Powerful Mysteries:    O Jesus, our Saving Justice, shine your light
                          into the darkness of our hearts, and grant
                          us peace.

Passion Mysteries (1): Jesus of Nazareth, Son of David, have mercy on
                          us.

Passion Mysteries (2): Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, have mercy
                          on us.

Glorious Mysteries:    Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have
                          mercy on us.




Sacramental Mysteries (optional):

Baptism:       Water from the Side of Jesus, wash away our sins, clothe us
                  in Christ our Lord.

Confession:    Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on
                  us poor sinners.

Confirmation:  Lord Holy Ghost, protect us in our hour of need,
                  strengthen us in our time of weakness, comfort us in
                  our time of sorrow; let us dwell forever under the
                  shadow of El Shaddai.

Eucharist:     Father in Heaven, give us this day our daily bread and
                  forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin
                  against us.

Holy Orders:   With all your soul, fear the Lord and honor his
                  priests; with all your might love him who made you,
                  and do not abandon his ministers.

Marriage:      Let that which God hath joined together let no one cast
                  asunder.

               Lord Jesus, let our marriage be a witness to our faith
                  in you.

Unction:       Lord Jesus Christ, enter into our brokeness, heal our
                  wounds with your gracious love, and fill our holes
                  with your abounding mercy.

(All reverence Crucifix)

Prayed on the Crucifix:  Apostles Creed
_______________________________________

We believe in one God,
  the Father, the Almighty,
  maker of heaven and earth,
  of all that is, seen and unseen.

We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
  the only Son of God,
  eternally begotten of the Father,
  God from God, Light from Light,
  true God from true God,
  begotten, not made,
  of one Being with the Father.
  Through him all things were made.
  For us and for our salvation
    he came down from heaven:
  by the power of the Holy Spirit
    he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary,
    and was made man.
  For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
    he suffered death and was buried.
    On the third day he rose again
      in accordance with the Scriptures;
    he ascended into heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
  He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
    and his kingdom will have no end.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
  who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
  With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified.
  He has spoken through the Prophets.
  We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.
  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sin.
  We look for the resurrection of the dead,
    and the life of the world to come.  Amen.

Our Father, who art in heaven,

Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
  as we forgive those
    who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
  but deliver us from evil.  Amen.

Hail Mary, full of grace;
  the Lord is with thee;

  now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.

My Jesus, really present in the most holy Sacrament of the Altar,

  to come spiritually into my soul
  through the immaculate heart of your most holy Mother,
  and abide with me forever.

Thou in me,
  and I in Thee,

  in Mary.

Sweet Mother Mary, please take this spiritual communion
  to bind together these roses, containing my (our) prayers,
  into a lovely boquet to carry with you into heaven.
Then fly, most holy Mother, fly away into heaven,
  embrace your Son, our Saviour, Jesus Christ,
  lay your sweet head upon His breast,

  inside the Sacred Heart of Jesus.  Amen.


Concluding prayer on the medal
______________________________

Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy,
  our life, our sweetness, and our hope.
To you do we cry, poor banished children of Eve.
To you do we send up our sighs,
  mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.
Turn then, O most gracious advocate,
  your eyes of mercy upon us;
  and in this our most dreadful exile
  show unto us the blessed fruit of your womb, Jesus.

O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.

That we may become worthy of the promises of Christ.

Amen.

        [ Some may wish to substitute Marian devotion with

        Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi

        Lord, make me an instrument of your peace;
           where there is hatred, let me sow love;
           where there is injury, pardon;
           where there is doubt, faith;
           where there is despair, hope;
           where there is darkness, light;
           where there is sadness, joy.

        O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
           to be consoled as to console;
           to be understood as to understand;
           to be loved as to love;
        for it is in giving that we receive,
           it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
           and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

           Chaplet or Beads of the Seven Dolours (Card)

 This is a devotion instituted in the course of the thirteenth
century, in honor of the sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary, endured
by her in compassion for the suffering and death of her Divine Son.
It is practiced upon a Chaplet composed of seven times seven beads,
each portion of seven being divided from the rest by medals,
representing the seven principal sorrows of her life.  In the use of
it a Hail, Mary has to be said on each of the beads, with one Our
Father before every seven Hail, Marys; and at the end of all, three
Hail, Marys are to be said, in honor of the sorrowful tears of our
Lady.

 While reciting the first Our Father, and seven Hail Marys, reflect on
and sympathize in the sorrow of our Blessed Lady, when she presented
her Divine Child in the Temple, and heard from the aged Simeon that a
sword of grief should pierce her soul on His account.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 At the second medal, reflect on her sorrow when, to escape the
cruelty of King Herod, she was forced to fly into Egypt with St.
Joseph and her beloved Child.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 At the third medal, reflect on her grief, when, in returning from
Jerusalem she perceived that she had lost her dear Jesus, whom she
sought sorrowing during three days.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 At the fourth, reflect on her meeting her Divine Son, all bruised and
mangled, carrying His cross to Calvary, and seeing Him fall under His
heavy weight.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 At the fifth, reflect on her standing by when her Divine Son was
lifted up on the cross, and the blood flowed in streams from His
sacred wounds.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 At the sixth, reflect on her sorrow, when her Divine Son was taken
down from the cross, and she received Him into her arms.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 Seventhly, and lastly, contemplate her following His sacred body, as
it was borne by Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus, to the sepulchre,
inclosed there, and hidden from her sight.

 Our Father, seven Hail, Marys.

 Three Hail, Marys, as mentioned before, in honor of her tears.

                         INDULGENCES

 Benedict XIII., September 26th, 1724, granted an indulgence of two
hundred days for every Our Father and every Hail Mary to those who,
with sincere contritition, and having confessed, or firmly purposing
to confess their sins, shall recite this Chaplet on any Friday, or on
any day of Lent, on the Festival of the Seven Dolours, or within the
Octave; and one hundred days on any other day of the year.

 Clement XII., December 12, 1734, confirmed these indulgences, and
moreover granted:--
 1.  A Plenary indulgence to those who shall have recited this Chaplet
for a month every day -- Confession, Communion and Prayers for the
Church, required as usual.
 2.  An indulgence of one hundred years to all who should recite it on
any day, having confessed their sins, with sincere sorrow, or at least
firmly purposing to do so.
 3.  One hundred and fifty years to those who should recite it on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and Holidays of obligation, with
Confession and Communion.
 4.  A Plenary indulgence once a year, on any day, to those who are
accustomed to recite it four times a week, on condition of Confession,
Communion, and the Recital of the Chaplet on the day of Communion.
 5.  Two hundred years' indulgence to all who recite it devoutly after
Confession; and to all who carry it about them, and frequently recite
it, ten years' indulgence every time they shall hear Mass, hear a
sermon, or reciting Our Father, and seven Hail Marys, shall perform
any spiritual or corporal work of mercy, in honor of our Blessed
Saviour, the Blessed Virgin Mary, or any Saint, their advocate.
 All these indulgences were confimred by a decree of January 17th,
1747, and rendered applicable to the souls in Purgatory.

                     Rosary of Good Saint Anne

 A Redemptorist devotion.  The Chaplet of Good Saint Anne originates
in 1875 and is the pious invention of a devout client of our saint.
If his name is unknown to man, he is surely known to God and dear to
Good Saint Anne, for these beads have been the beginning of a chain of
blessings, spiritual and temporal.  Many graces and favors have been
obtained through their recitation.

 The Little Chaplet of Good Saint Anne is composed of three Our
Fathers and fifteen Hail Marys and is divided into three parts; the
first part, one Our Father and five Haily Marys, is said in honor of
Jesus, the Author of Grace; the second in honor of Mary, the channel
through which all graces come to us from Jesus; the third in honor of
Good Saint Anne, our advocate.

 Manner of reciting:  Make the sign of the cross; then kiss devoutly
the medal of Good Saint Anne saying the prayer:  Jesus, Mary, Anne.
While reciting the first part thank Jesus for His favors, ask pardon
for sins and future favors.  While reciting the second part praise
Mary and ask her to present your petition to Good Saint Anne.  The
third part is a petition to Good Saint Anne.  Each group is concluded
with a Glory Be as an act of praise to the Blessed Trinity.

 This information is quoted from TWENTY-FOUR ROSARIES AND CHAPLETS by
Patrick Shaughnessy, O.S.B., S.T.D.  Reprinted 1984 by Our Lady's
Rosary Makers.

                  Chaplet of Saint Anne

 Recite three times Our Father, etc. and fifteen times Hail Mary, etc.
The first time say once Our Father, etc. and five times Hail Mary,
etc. in honor of Jesus; the second time in honor of Mary, and the
third time in honor of St. Anne, and repeat after each Ave the three
names; Jesus, Mary, Anne.

                      The Healing Mysteries
                      A Rosary for the Sick

                         (Joanne Turpin)

 The First Mystery:

        The healing of the crippled man at the pool of Bethesda

The Second Mystery:

        The healing of the woman with an infirmity of spirit

The Third Mystery:

        The healing of the paralytic at Capernaum

The Fourth Mystery:

        The healing of the woman suffering from hemorrhage

The Fifth Mystery:

        The healing of the blind man at Jericho

              The Little Chaplet of the Holy Face

 The purpose of the Crown or Chaplet of the Holy Face is to honor the
Five Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and to ask of God the triumph of
His holy Church.

 This chaplet is composed of a cross and thirty-nine beads; of these
six are large beads and thirty-three small ones; to this chaplet is
attached a medal of the Holy Face.

 On the Cross, which reminds us of the mystery of our redemption, we
begin the chaplet by saying the words:  "Incline unto my aid, O God; O
Lord make haste to help me.  Glory be."

 The thirty-three small beads represent the thirty-three years of the
mortal life of our Divine Lord.  The first thrity beads recall to us
the thirty years of His hidden life, and are divided into five parts
of six beads each, in honor of the senses of touch, hearing, sight,
smell, and taste of Jesus, and, as they were situated princippaly in
His holy face, to render reparative homage for all the sufferings
which our Lord has endured in His Face through each of these senses.

 Each six beads are preceded by a a large bead, followed by a Glory be
to recall the sense we wish to honor.  The three other beads mark the
three years of the public life of Our Lord, and have for their
intention to honor all the wounds of His adorable Face; there are also
preceded by a large bead, to be followed by a Glory be for the same
intention.

 On each large bead is said:  "My Jesus Mercy."  On the small beads is
said:  "Arise, O Lord!  and let Thy enemies be scattered, and let them
that hate Thee fly before Thy Face."

 The Glory be is recited seven times in honor of the seven last words
of Jesus upon the cross, and the Seven Dolours of the Immaculate
Virgin.

 The chaplet is concluded by saying on the medal:  "God, our
Protector, look down upon us and cast Thine eyes upon the Face of Thy
Christ."

 This chaplet was composed by Sister Saint-Pierre, a Carmelite of
Tours.  Saint Athanasius relates that the devils, on being asked what
verse in the whole Scripture they feared the most, replied:  "That
with which the sixty-seventh Psalm commences:  'Let God arise, and let
His enemies be scattered let them that hate Him flee from before His
face.'"  They added that this always compelled them to take flight.

                   Chaplet of the Holy Ghost (card)

 The Chaplet of the Holy Ghost was composed in 1892 by a Franciscan
Capuchin missionary of the English province in order to give the
faithful an easy means of honoring the Holy Ghost.  It was approved by
Pope Leo XIII in 1902.  It is intended to be in regard to the Holy
Ghost what the Dominican Rosary is in regard to the Blessed Virgin.

 This rosary consists of 5 groups of 7 beads each.  Before and after
each group there are 2 large beads, that is, 12 large beads in all.
In addition there are 3 small beads at the beginning.  On these three
beads one makes the sign of the Cross, recites an act of contrition
and the hymn Come Holy Ghost.

 In each group the Glory be is said on the 7 small beads, an Our
Father and a Haily Mary on the 2 large beads.  On the remaining 2
large beads are said the Apostles Creed and an Our Father and Hail
Mary for the intention of the Holy Father.

 There is a mystery for each of the 5 groups; the number 5
commemorating the Five Wounds of Jesus which are the fountains of
grace which the Holy Ghost imparts to all men.  The reflections
suggested are as follows:

        THE FIRST MYSTERY

     By the Holy Ghost is Jesus conceived of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

 The Meditation:  "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power
of the Most High shall overshadow thee; and therefore also the Holy
which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God."
(Luke, I, 35)

 The Practice:  Diligently implore the aid of the Divine Spirit, and
Mary's intercession, to imitate the virtues of Jesus Christ, Who is
the Model of virtues, so that you may be made comformable to the image
of the Son of God.

        THE SECOND MYSTERY

     The Spirit of the Lord rested upon Jesus when he was baptized.

 The Meditation:  "Jesus, being baptized, forthwith came out of the
water:  and lo! the heavens were opened to Him, and he saw the Spirit
of God descending as a dove, and coming upon Him."  (Matthew, III, 16)

 The Practice:  Hold in the highest esteem the priceless gift of
sanctifying grace, infused into your soul by the Holy Ghost in
Baptism.  Keep the promises to which you then pledged yourself.
Increase, by constant practice, Faith, Hope, and Charity.  Ever live
as becometh children of God and members of God's true Church, so as to
obtain, hereafter, the inheritance of heaven.

        THE THIRD MYSTERY

     By the Spirit is Jesus led into the desert to be
     tempted by the Devil.

 The Meditation:  "Jesus, being full of the Holy ghost, returned from
the Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the desert for the space of
forty days; and was tempted by the devil."  (Luke, IV, 1-2)

 The Practice:  Be ever grateful for the sevenfold gift of the Holy
Ghost bestowed upon you in Confirmation, for the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, of counsel and fortitude, of knowledge and piety, and
of the fear of the Lord.  Faithfully yield to His Divine guidance, so
that, in all the trials and temptations of life, you may act manfully,
as becometh a perfect Christian and valiant soldier of Jesus Christ.

        THE FOURTH MYSTERY

     The Holy Ghost in the Church.

 The Meditation:  "Suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a
mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house wehre they were
sitting....and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
speak....the wonderful works of God."  (Acts, II, 2, 4, 11.)

 The Practice:  Thank God for having made you a child of His Church
which is ever animated and directed by the Divine Spirit, sent into
this world for that purpose of the day of Pentecost.  Hear and obey
the Holy See, the infallible mouthpiece of the Holy Ghost, and the
Church, the pillar and ground of truth.  Uphold her doctrines, seek
her interests, defend her rights.

        THE FIFTH MYSTERY

     The Holy Ghost in the soul of the just man and just woman.

 The Meditation:  "Know you not that you members are the temple of the
Holy Ghost, Who is in you?" (I Cor., VI, 19.)

 "Extinguish not the Spirit."  (I Thess., V, 19.)

 "And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto
the day of redemption."  (Eph., IV, 30.)

 The Practice:  Be evver mindful of the Holy Ghost Who is within you,
and carefully cultivate purity of soul and body.  Faithfully obey His
Divine Inspirations so taht you may bring forth the Fruits of the
Spirit -- Charity, Joy, Peace, Patience, Eenignity, Goodness,
Long-suffering, Mildness, Faith, Modesty, Continency, Chastity.

 Conclude with the "I believe" as a profession of faith.

 Say finally once Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be to the Father,
for the intentions of the Sovereign Pontiff.

               Rosary of the Holy Wounds of Our Lord Jesus Christ

                                      OR

                               Chaplet of Mercy

May be said on the Rosary beads.

On the large beads:  Eternal Father, I offer Thee the WOUNDS of
                     Our Lord Jesus Christ -- To heal the wounds
                     of our souls.
                                    (300 days indulgence each time)

On the small beads:  My Jesus, pardon and mercy -- Through the merits
                     of Thy HOLY WOUNDS.
                                     (300 days indulgence each time)

Sacred Penetentiary, January 15, 1924.

These two invocations were taught by Our Lord to Sr. Mary Martha
Chambon, deceased, in the Vistation of Chambery, France, Marcy 21,
1907.  The Sister received from Our Lord a double "Mission":
constantly to invoke the HOLY WOUNDS herself, and to revive this
devotion in the world.

      Promises of Our Lord to Sr. Mary Martha

"I will grant all that is asked of Me by the invocation of My HOLY
WOUNDS.  You must spread the devotion."

              Rosary of the Immaculate Conception

 This chaplet consists of 3 groups of 4 beads each.  An Our Father
bead is placed between each group and a medal of the Immaculate
Conception is attached on the end of the Rosary.  Saint John
Berchmans, S.J., composed this Rosary and prayed it daily to obtain,
through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the grace never
to commit any sin against the virtue of purity.  Beads are pale blue
for the Immaculate Conception.

 This is how to pray the Rosary of the Immaculate Conception:

Begin with the Sign of the Cross:  In the Name of the Father, and of
                                   the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
                                   Amen.

Pray the Our Father

Next pray the following:  Blessed be the Holy and Immaculate
(4 times on 4 beads)      Conception of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.

Pray the Glory Be after each set.  Pray all three sets.

If you wish, you may conclude by praying the Consecration to Mary by
Saint John Berchmans, S.J.:

 Holy Mary, Mother of God and Virgin, I choose you this day for my
Queen, patron, and advocate, and I firmly resolve:  never to abandon
you; never to say or do anything against you, nor to permit that
anything be done by others to dishonor you.  Receive me, then, I beg
of you, as your perpetual servant.  Assist me in all my actions, and
do not abandon me at the hour of my death.  Amen.

                Chaplet of the Immaculate Conception (card)

    Method of saying

In the Name of the Father,
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

   First set of Beads

Blessed be the Holy and Immaculate
Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

The Our Father once, Hail Mary four times, Gloria once.

   Second Set

Same prayers

   Third Set

Same prayers

   Indulgence

300 days.  Plenary, once a month.

            Chaplet in Honor of the Immaculate Heart of Mary

                            Our Lady of Sorrows

 This chaplet consists of 5 groups, each comprising 1 Our Father and
7 Hail Marys.  One begins with the prayer:  "Incline unto my aid,
O God; O Lord, make haste to help me."

                         Little Crown

                             OR

            Chaplet of the Infant Jesus of Prague

 This chaplet consists of 3 Our Fathers in honor of the Holy Family,
and 12 Hail Marys in memory of the 12 years of the Sacred Infancy of
our Divine Saviour.  To this chaplet of 15 beads is attached a medal
of the Infant Jesus [of Prague].

 On the medal the following invocation is said:  "Divine Infant Jesus,
I adore Thy Cross and I accept all the cross Thou wilt be pleased to
send me.  Adorable Trinity, I offer Thee for the glory of Thy Holy
Name of God, all the adorations of the Sacred Heart of the Holy Infant
Jesus."

 Each Our Father and Hail Mary is preceded by the aspiration:  "And
the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us."  On terminating the
chaplet say:  "Holy Infant Jesus, bless and protect us."

 This devotion owers its origin to the zeal of Sister Marguerite, a
Carmelite religious, who died in France in 1648.  She was
distinguished for her devotion to the Holy Child Jesus.

        Chaplet of the Holy Infant Jesus (card)

                  The More You Honor Me
                 The More I Will Bless You

 On the medal the following invocation is said:

 "Divine Infant Jesus, I adore Thy Cross, and I accept all the crosses
Thou wilt be pleased to send me.  Adorable Trinity, I offer Thee for
the glory of the Holy Name of God, all the adorations of the Sacred
Heart of the Holy Infant Jesus."

 Each "Our Father" and "Hail Mary" is preceded by the aspiration:

 "And the Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us."

 On terminating the chaplet, say:

 "Holy Infant Jesus, bless and protect us."

 The Divine Infant revealed to His faithful servant how pleasing to
Him is this holy practice; He promised her that He would grant special
graces, above all purity of heart and innocence, to all who carried
the chaplet on their person and recited it in honor of the mysteries
of His holy infancy.  As a sign of His approval, He showed her these
chaplets shining with a supernatural light.

        Novena to the Infant Jesus of Prague in Urgent Need
        (To be said for nine days or nine consecutive hours)

    O Jesus, Who said, "Ask and you shall receive, seek and you shall find,
    knock and it shall be opened to you," through the intercession of Mary,
    Your most holy Mother, I knock, I seek, I ask that my prayer be answered.
    (Mention your request.)

    O Jesus, Who said, "All that you ask of the Father in My Name He will
    grant you," through the intercession of Mary, Your most holy Mother,
    I humbly and urgently ask Your Father in Your Name that my prayer be
    granted.  (Mention your request.)

    O Jesus, Who said, "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My word shall
    not pass," through the intercession of Mary, Your most holy Mother, I
    feel confident that my prayer will be granted.  (Mention your request.)

                        The Jesus Prayer

        Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me."

Compiler's note:  Or:

        Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God,
        have mercy on us.

 The following is quoted directly from:  THE MANUAL OF PRAYERS FOR
CONGREGATIONAL USE.  London:  Burns Oates & Washbourne Ltd.
Publishers to the Holy See.  1942.

                        THE JESUS PSALTER

 This Psalter was composed probably by Richard Whytford, first a
Secular Priest, then a Brigittin of Syon House, Middlesex, in the
fifteenth century.  An original MS. is in the possession of Lord
Abergavenny.  Bishop Challoner's edition, which is here given, is a
compressed formulary, and the language is generally modernized.

There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be
saved.                                                   ACTS iv, 12

The holy name is not to be repeated hastily, but with great reverence
and devotion.

                             PART I

You must begin by a devout kneeling, or bowing, at the adorable name
of JESUS, saying:

 In the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in
heaven, on earth, and under the earth:  and ... every tongue confess,
that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.
                                                      Phil. ii, 10-11

                      FIRST PETITION

        Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, }
        Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, }   have mercy on me.
        Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, }

Jesus, have mercy on me, O God of compassion, and forgive the many and
great offences which I have committed in thy sight.  Many have been
the follies of my life, and great are the miseries which I have
deserved for my ingratitude.

Have mercy on me, dear Jesus, for I am weak; O Lord, heal me, who am
unable to help myself.

Deliver me from setting my heart upon any of thy creatures, which may
divert my eyes from a continual looking-up to thee.

Grant me grace henceforth, for the love of thee, to hate sin; and, out
of a just esteem of thee, to despise all worldly vanities.

Have mercy on all sinners, Jesus, I beseech thee; turn their vices
into virtues; and, making them true observers of thy law, and sincere
lovers of thee, bring them to bliss in everlasting glory.

Have mercy also on the souls in purgatory, for thy bitter Passion, I
beseech thee, and for thy glorious name Jesus.

O blessed Trinity, one eternal God, have mercy on me.

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom
come.  Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.

Rx  Give us this day our daily bread.  And forgive us our trespasses
as well forgive them that trespass against us.  And lead us not into
temptation:  but deliver us from evil.  Amen.

Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee:  blessed art thou
among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Rx  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour
of our death.  Amen.

                   The Chaplet of Saint Jude

 Oh Holy St. Jude, Apostle and Martyr, great in virtue and rich in
miracles, near kinsman of Jesus Christ, faithful intercessor of all
who invoke your special help in time of need.  To you I have recourse
from the depth of my heart and humbly request assistance.  Help me in
my present and urgent petition.  In return, I promise to make your
name known and cause you to be invoked.

 Say three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys and Glorias.

 This novena, if said in good faith, has never been known to fail and
must be said for nine consecutive days.

                  Little Crown of the Blessed Virgin

 The following is quoted from the appendix to "True Devotion to the
Blessed Virgin" by Saint Louis de Montfort.  This Rosary appears to be
basically the same as the Rosary of the Immaculate Conception but I
include it here as found in Louis's book because the recitation of the
prayers is slightly different and, while the purity of the Virgin is
invoked, there is no actual mention of the "Immaculate Conception,"
which I don't think had yet been defined.

BEGIN QUOTATION

 St. John the Evangelist saw a woman crowned with twelve stars,
clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet.  According to the
commentators, this woman is the Blessed Virgin Mary, with her virtues
and her privileges, especially that of her divine maternity.  Thus
originated the "Little Crown of the Twelve Stars of the Blessed Virgin
Mary," which St. Joseph Calasanctius, St. John Berchmans and many
other saints made it a practice to recite frequently.

 In order to make this prayer more attractive, St. Louis de Montfort
added to each Hail Mary one of the praises of the Blessed Virgin, with
the invocation, "Rejoice, O Virgin mary; rejoice a thousand times."

 It is this prayer which Louis de Montfort gave to his religious
families (the Montfort Fathers and the Daughters of Wisdom) as their
morning prayer.  He also recommends it to all those who embrace the
devotion of the holy and loving salvery of Jesus through Mary.

LITTLE CROWN OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY

I.  Crown of Excellence

       (To honor the divine maternity of the Blessed Virgin,
       her ineffable virginity, her purity without stain,
       and her innumerable virtues.)

1.  Our Father.
    Hail Mary.
    Blessed art you, O Virgin Mary, who didst bear the Lord, the
    Creator of the world; thou didst give birth to Him Who made
    thee and remainest a Virgin forever.
    Rejoice, O Virgin Mary.
    Rejoice a thousand times!

2.  Hail Mary.
    O holy and immaculate Virgin, I know not with what praise to
    extoll thee, since thou didst bear in thy womb the very One Whom

    Rejoice a thousand times.

7.  Hail Mary.
    Glory be to thee, O Mediatrix between God and man!  Through thee

III.Crown of Goodness

        (To honor the mercy of the Blessed Virgin toward sinners, the
        poor, the just and the dying.)

9.  Our Father.
    Hail Mary.
    Glory be to thee, O refuge of sinner!  Intercede for us with God.
    Rejoice, O Virgin Mary.
    Rejoice a thousand times.

10. Hail Mary.
    Glory be to thee, O Mother of orphans!  Render the Almighty
    favorable to us.
    Rejoice, O Virgin Mary.
    Rejoice a thousand times.

11. Glory be to thee, O joy of the just!  Lead us with thee to the
    joys of heaven.
    Rejoice, O Virgin Mary.
    Rejoice a thousand times.

12. Hail Mary.
    Glory be to thee who art ever ready to assist us in life and in
    death!  Lead us with thee to the kingdom of heaven!
    Rejoice, O Virgin Mary.
    Rejoice a thousand times.
    Glory be to the Father.

                              Let us pray

 Hail, Mary, Daughter of God the Father; Hail, Mary, Mother of God the
Son; Hail, Mary, Spouse of the Holy Ghost; Hail, Mary, Temple of the
Most Holy Trinity; Hail, Mary, my Mistress, my treasure, my joy, Queen
of my heart; my Mother, my life, my sweetness, my dearest hope, yea, my
heart and my soul!  I am all thine and all that I have is thine, O
Virgin blessed above all things!  Let thy soul be in me to magnify the
Lord; let thy spirit be in me to rejoice in God.  Set thyself, O
faithful Virgin, as a seal upon my heart, that in thee and through
thee I may be found faithful to God.  Receive me, O gracious Virgin,
among those whom thou lovest and teachest, whom thou leadest,
nourishest and protectest as thy children.  Grant that for love of
thee I may despise all earthly consolations and ever cling to those of
heaven; until through the Holy Ghost, thy faithful Spouse, and through
thee, His faithful spouse, Jesus Christ thy Son be formed in me for
the glory of the Father.  Amen.

                    Little Flower Rosary

 This chaplet consists of 24 beads, commemorating the 24 years of
Saint Therese's life, and one additional bead.  On the one bead the
following ejaculation is said:  "Saint Therese of the Infant Jesus,
Patroness of Missions, pray for us."  On the other 24 beads is said
the Glory be to honor the Holy Trinity in thanksgiving for having
given us the Little Saint who lived in this world but 24 years.

 The use of this chaplet is encouraged by the Carmelite Fathers.

             Rosary or Little Beads of Our Lady of Consolation

 This chaplet consists of 13 beads with a medal of Saint Augustine.
On each bead is said an Our Father and a Hail Mary, and at the end the
Hail, Holy Queen is recited.  The 12 Our Fathers and Hail Marys are in
honor of the 12 Apostles; the other Our Father and Hail Mary are in
honor of Our Lord, King of the Apostles.

 While reciting these prayers one should meditate on the 12 articles
of the Apostles' Creed and pray for the safety of the Holy Father, the
Pope and the welfare of the Church.

 This chaplet is designated especially for the Augustinian secular
tertiaries.

                        Penal Rosary

Sorry to get your hopes up for nothing.  A Penal Rosary (I don't know
where the name comes from) consists of a single decade (i.e. one large
bead, ten small beads) with a ring at one end.  You slip the ring over
your thumb, and pray the first decade of a normal (Dominican) Rosary.
Then you move the ring to your index finger, and pray the second decade.
And so on.  Not really a new Rosary -- just a more compact version
of the old one.

Hello!  I am an enforced lurker on soc.religion.christian (UVA
doesn't allow us to post, only to read).  I saw your post about
the Lutheran Rosary.  While I don't have any information about
this one specifically, I do have a very, *very* good book on the
rosary in general (I was surprised to find out how many different
kinds there are.)  The book is a thin little gem called A DOORWAY
TO SILENCE by David (??) Llewelyn (sp?).  I got it from the Holy
Rosary Apostolate in Canada.  I don't have the address on me, but
if you are interested, I will try to find the info. for you.  The
book has a few pages of into concerning what the rosary is and
what it is for, and the rest of the book is about the practice of
contemplative prayer, answers to difficulties one encounters when
attempting same, techniques to focus concentration, etc.  It has
a very gentle, patient tone and pace, and I have found it to have
had the greatest influence on my prayer life of any devotional
material I have ever read, save the Bible itself.

In closing, I found this in another pamphlet on rosaries in
general, and it is now my standard prayer when I'm saying the
rosary.  The prayers are taken from the Anglican Book of Common
Prayer, which is in turn largely taken from the Bible.

        Crucifix:  Nicene Creed
        1st bead:  Lord's Prayer
        3 beads and decade beads:
            Blessed be Christ Jesus, very God and very man,
            Blessed be the holy Name of Jesus.
            O Saviour of the world, who by thy cross and
             precious blood hast redeemed us,
            Save us and help us, we humbly beseech thee, O Lord.
        2nd single bead: Gloria
        Medallion:  Lord's Prayer
        Beads between decades:  Gloria to end decade and Lord's
            Prayer to begin new decade.

I haven't come up with a suitable prayer to end the rosary, so I
use something I found in a Lenten Study guide - don't know it's
history.
       Jesus, may all that is you flow into me.
       May your body and blood be my food and my drink.
       May your passion and death be my strength and my life.
       Jesus, with you by my side, enough has been given.
       May the shelter I seek be the shadow of your cross.
       Let me not run from the love which you offer,
       But hold me safe from the forces of evil.
       On each of my dyings, shed your light and your love.
       Keep calling to me until that day comes,
       When, with your saints, I may praise you forever.  Amen.

I also use this as a personal thanksgiving after receiving
Communion.

God bless you and keep you!

    Chaplet in Honor of the Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ

                       (Precious Blood Fathers)

 This chaplet consists of 33 beads, in honor of the thirty-three years
of Our Lord's life on earth.  There are 6 groups of 5 beads each, and
3 closing beads, and a medal of the Precious Blood.  For each group
one says the Our Father 5 times and the Glory be 1 time.  On the final
group of 3 beads one says the Our Father 3 times and the Glory be
1 time.

 In the beginning say:  "Incline unto my aid, O God.  O Lord, make
haste to help me.  Glory be, etc.

 There are 7 mysteries recalling the occasions on which Our Saviour
shed His Blood for us.  After each group of 5 Our Fathers and 1 Glory
be, the following prayer is said:  "We therefore pray Thee, help Thy
servants whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy Precious Blood."

               Rosary of the Blessed Name of Jesus

Joyful Mysteries:  Incarnation, Birth of Jesus, Circumcision,
                   Finding in the Temple, Baptism of Jesus

Sorrowful Mysteries:  Washing the Feet of the Disciples,
                      Prayer of Jesus in the Garden of Gesthsemene,
                      Our Saviour is Apprehended or Arrested,
                      Our Saviour Carries His Cross,
                      Descent of Our Saviour into Hell

Glorious Mysteries:  Resurrection, Ascension, Our Lord Jesus Sends
                     Down His Holy Ghost, Our Lord Jesus Crowning

                     Our Lord Jesus Christ Coming to Judge Mankind

I believe this Rosary is sometimes called the Old Dominican Rosary.
The mantra is also different, being the following:

Joyful   :  O Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on us (10 times).*
Sorrowful:  Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, have mercy on us.*
Glorious :  Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God, have mercy on us.*

                Rosary of Saint Michael and All Angels

 The Rosary of Saint Michael and All Angels is a lovely Rosary
consisting of nine sets of prayers; one Our Father and three Hail
Marys is prayed for each of the nine choirs of angels.  The nine
choirs of angels are:

Cherubim        Dominions       Principalities
Seraphim        Virtues         Archangels
Thrones         Powers          Angels

 One day, Saint Michael, Prince of Angels, appeared to a devout
servant of God named Antonia d' Astonac.  The Arch-angel Michael said
to her, "I wish to be honored by nine salutations corresponding to the
nine Choirs of Angels, consisting of one Our Father and three Hail
Marys for each of the angelic choirs."  Saint Michael went on to
promise that anyone who prayed this devotion in his honor would have,
when approaching the Holy Altar to receive the Eucharist, an escort of
nine angels chosen by himself from each of the nine choirs of angels.
In addition, he promised that anyone who recited this devotion daily
would be given during his life Prince Michael's own protection as well
as the continual assistance of all of God's holy angels.  Furthermore,
after death, such a one will obtain for himself and his relations
deliverance from purgatory.

 This is the method of reciting the chaplet:

 The chaplet is begun by saying the following invocation on the
Powerful Medal (Saint Benedict's Medal):

        O God, come to my assistance.
        O Lord, make haste to help me.
        Glory be, etc.

These are the nine salutations to be followed by one Our Father and
three Hail Marys:

 Following the nine salutations, pray one Our Father in honor of each
of the following leading angels:  Saint Michael, Saint Gabriel, Saint
Raphael, and our Guardian Angel.  Personally, I myself pray one Our
Father in honor of the following four angels:  Saint Michael, Saint
Gabriel, Saint Uriel, and Saint Raphael; I requested that God make
Uriel and Raphael my guardian angels.  On the Guardian Angel Medal I
say an additional Our Father for my personal Guardian Angel whose name
I do not know.

        Prayer

merciful desire for the salvation of all men, hast appointed the most

we beg through the merits of Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.

On the front of the Powerful Medal is Saint Benedict.  The Latin says:

        Ejus in obitu nostro praesentia muniamur
        At our death may we be protected by his presence

The medal, especially when properly blessed, is a protection when worn
or carried on one's person, or when attached to walls, doors, or other
objects.

Passion of Christ, strengthen me!
O Good Jesus, hear me!
Within Thy wounds, hide me;

                     Chaplet of Saint Anthony

 Chaplet of Saint Anthony (Franciscan).  The Chaplet of St. Anthony is
composed of thirteen groups (or decades) of three beads each, at the
end of which may be a medal of Saint Anthony holding the Infant Jesus.
On the first bead of each group (or decade) is said the Our Father, on
the second the Hail Mary, and on the third the Glory Be to the Father,
etc.  At the end the Miraculous Responsory is recited:

        If miracles thou fain wouldst see
        Do, error, death, calamity,
        The leprous stain, the demon flies,
        From beds of pain the sick arise.

           The hungry seas forego their prey,
           The prisoner's cruel chains give way;
           While palsied limbs and chattels lost,
           Both young and old recovered boast.

        And perils perish; plenty's hoard
        Is heaped on hunger's famished board;
        Let those relate who know it well,
        Let Padua of her patron tell.

           The hungry seas, etc.
        Glory be to the Father, etc.
           The hungry seas, etc.

        V.  Pray for us Blessed Anthony.

        R.  That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

                Let Us Pray

 O God!  Let the votive commemoration of Blessed Anthony, thy
Confessor, be a source of joy to thy Church, that she may always be
fortified with spiritual assistance, and may deserve to possess
eternal joy.  Through Christ, Our Lord.  Amen.

 During the prayers meditation on the following virtues of the saint
is recommended:  Faith, Hope, Charity, Love of Jesus, Prudence,
Justice, Patience, Penance, Humility, Purity, Obedience, Poverty,
Spirit of Prayer, and Union with God.

 An indulgence of one hundred days each time.  A plenary indulgence,
once a month.

 Another method calls for meditation on the following thirteen
petitions while reciting thirteen times the Our Father, Hail Mary,
Glory be.

1.      Saint Anthony, raiseth the dead, pray for those Christians now
        in their agony, and for our dear departed.

2.      Saint Anthony, zealous preacher of the Gospel, fortify us
        against the errors of the enemies of God, and pray for the
        Pope and the Church.

3.      Saint Anthony, powerful with the Heart of Jesus, preserve us
        from the calamities which threaten us on account of our sins.

4.      Saint Anthony, who drivest away devils, make us triumph over
        their snares.

5.      Saint Anthony, lily of heavenly purity, purify us from the
        stains of the soul and preserve our bodies from all dangers.

6.      Saint Anthony, healer of the sick, cure our diseases and
        preserve us in health.

7.      Saint Anthony, guide of travellers, bring to safe harbor those
        who are in danger of perishing, and calm the troubled waves of
        passion which agitate our souls.

8.      Saint Anthony, liberatory of captives, deliver us from the
        captivity of evil.

9.      Saint Anthony, who restorest to young and old the use of their
        limbs, obtain for us the perfect use of the senses of our body
        and the faculties of our soul.

10.     Saint Anthony, finder of lost things, help us to find all that
        we lost in the spiritual and temporal order.

11.     Saint Anthony, protected by Mary, avert the dangers which
        threaten our body and our soul.

12.     Saint Anthony, helper of the poor, help us in our needs and
        give bread and work to those who ask.

13.     Saint Anthony, we thankfully proclaim thy miraculous power,
        and we beseech thee to protect us all the days of our life.

(At times this chaplet may be composed of 13 beads instead of 13
groups of 3 beads each.)

 PRAYER TO OBTAIN FROM SAINT ANTHONY THE RESTORATION OF THINGS THAT
ARE LOST.

 Great Saint Anthony, who hast received from God a special power to
recover lost things, help me that I may find that which I am now
seeking.  Obtain for me, also, an active faith, perfect docility to
the inspirations of grace, disgust for the vain pleasures of the
world, and an ardent desire for the imperishable goods of an
everlasting happiness.  Amen.

Saint Benedict

First Prayer

Oh Jesus Christ!  Eternal Sweetness to those who love Thee, joy surpassing
all joy and all desire, Salvation and Hope of all sinners, Who hast proved
that Thou hast no greater desire than to be among men, even assuming human
nature at the fullness of time for the love of men, recall all the
sufferings Thou hast endured from the instant of Thy conception, and
especially during Thy Passion, as it was decreed and ordained from all
eternity in the Divine plan.

Remember, oh Lord, that during the Last Supper with Thy disciples, having
washed their feet, Thou gavest them Thy Most Precious Body and Blood, and
while at the same time Thou didst weetly console them, Thou didst foretell
them Thy coming Passion.

Remember the sadness and bitterness which Thou didst experience in Thy Soul
as Thou Thyself bore witness saying:  "My Soul is sorrowful even unto
death."

Remember all the fear, anguish and pain that Thou didst suffer in Thy
delicate Body before the torment of the Crucifixion, when, after having
prayed three times, bathed in a sweat of blood, Thou wast betrayed by Judas,
Thy disciple, arrested by the people of a nation Thou hadst chosen and
elevated, accused by false witnesses, unjustly judged by three judges during
the flower of Thy youth and during the solemn Paschal season.

Remember that Thou wast despoiled of Thy garments and clothed in those of
derision; that Thy Face and Eyes were veiled, that Thou wast buffeted,
crowned with throns, a reed placed in Thy Hands, that Thou was crushed with
blows and overwhelmed with affronts and outrages.

In memory of all these pains and sufferings which Thou didst endure before
Thy Passion on the Cross, grant me before my death true contrition, a
sincere and entire confession, worthy satisfaction and the remission of all
my sins.  Amen.

Second Prayer

Oh Jesus!  True liberty of angels, Paradise of delights, remember the horror
and sadness which Thou didst endure when Thy enemies, like furious lions,
surrounded Thee, and by thousands of insults, spits, blows, lacerations and
other unheard-of-cruelties, tormented Thee at will.  In consideration of
these torments and insulting words, I beseech Thee, oh my Saviour, to
deliver me from all my enemies, visible and invisible, and to bring me,
under Thy protection, to the perfection of eternal salvation.  Amen.

Third Prayer

Oh Jesus!  Creator of Heaven and earth Whom nothing can encompass or limit,
Thou Who dost enfold and hold all under Thy Loving power, remember the very
bitter pain Thou didst suffer when the Jews nailed Thy Sacred Hands and Feet
to the Cross by blow after blow with big blunt nails, and not finding Thee
in a pitiable enough state to satisfy their rage, they enlarged Thy Wounds,
and added pain to pain, and with indescribable cruelty stretched Thy Body on
the Cross, pulled You from all sides, thus dislocating Your Limbs.

I beg of Thee, oh Jesus, by the memory of this most Loving suffering of the
Cross, to grant me the grace to fear Thee and to Love Thee.  Amen.

Fourth Prayer

Oh Jesus!  Heavenly Physician, raised aloft on the Cross to heal our wounds
with Yours, remember the bruises which Thou didst suffer and the weakness of
all Thy Members which were distended to such a degree that never was there
pain like unto Thine.  From the crown of Thy Head to the Soles of Thy Feet
there was not one spot on THy Body that was not in torment, and yet,
forgetting all Thy sufferings, Thou didst not cease to pray to Thy Heavenly
Father for Thy enemies, saying:  "Father forgive them for they know not what
they do."

Through this great Mercy, and in memory of this suffering, grant that the
remembrance of Thy Most Bitter Passion may effect in us a perfect contrition
and the remission of all our sins.  Amen.

Fifth Prayer

Oh Jesus!  Mirror of eternal splendor, remember the sadness which Thou
experienced, when contemplating in the light of Thy Divinity the
predestination of those who would be saved by the merits of Thy Sacred
Passion, Thou didst see at the same time, the great multitude of reprobates
who would be damned for their sins, and Thou didst complain bitterly of
those hopeless lost and unfortunate sinners.

                  Chaplet of Saint Joseph

 This chaplet consists of 15 groups of beads, each group having
1 white and 3 blue beads.  At the end there is an additional group and
also 1 extra blue bead.  On the white beads is recited the Hail Mary
while one meditates on a mystery of the rosary.  On each blue bead one
says:  "Praised and blessed be Jesus, Mary, and Joseph."

 The beads of the Rosary of Saint Joseph are white and blue,
symbolizing his purity and piety.

piety.

following prayer is said:

among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of
our death.  Amen.

On each of the beads in the groups of three say:  "Praised and blessed
be Jesus, Mary and Joseph."

The chaplet is ended with the following prayer:

V.  Pray for us, O Holy St. Joseph

R.  That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

                    Let Us Pray

O God, Who has predestined St. Joseph from all eternity for the
service of Thine eternal Son and His Blessed Mother, and made him
worthy to be the spouse of the blessed Virgin and the foster-father of
Thy Son:  we beseech Thee, through all the services he has rendered to
Jesus and Mary on earth, that Thou wouldst make us worthy of his
intercession and grant us to enjoy the happiness of his company in
heaven.  Through Christ Our Lord.  Amen.

                 Seven-Day Scriptural Rosary

                        (Larry London)

 The distinguishing feature of the Seven-Day Scriptural Rosary is that
there is a unique set of five rosary mysteries for each day of the
week.  There are a total of three hundred fifty Scripture excerpts for
meditation.  One is read before each Hail Mary over the course of the
week, fifty each day of the week.  Five of the total thirty-five
rosary mysteries are prayed each day.  Each mystery contains ten Hail
marys along with the corresponding Scripture meditation, and so we
have a Rosarium -- fifty Hail Marys -- prayed each day.

 Below are listed the recommended mysteries for each day of the week:

                Chaplet of the Way of the Cross

 This chaplet consists of 15 groups of 3 beads each, between which are
medals representing the stations of the cross.  An additional 6 beads
are added as well as a crucifix.

 This chaplet of the Way of the Cross was granted to Vincentian Order
by Popes Pius IX and X.  Later it was withdrawn by the Holy Office
(1912), since the indulgences can be gained by using the crucifix
alone.

 It is somewhat of a misnomer to call this a rosary.  To the sick and
to others who cannot go to a church to make the Way of the Cross the
Holy See has given the privilege of gaining the indulgences attached
to the Way of the Cross by holding in their hand a specially
indulgenced crucifix and saying the prescribed prayers, the Our
Father, Hail Mary, and Glory be 20 times.

Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Ponti Pilato;
passus et sepultus est,
et resurrexit tertia die, secundum scripturas,
et ascendit in Caelum, Sedet ad dexteram Patri.
Et iterum venturas est cum gloria, iudicare vivos et mortuos,

Confiteor unum baptisma in remissionem peccatorum.
Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum,
