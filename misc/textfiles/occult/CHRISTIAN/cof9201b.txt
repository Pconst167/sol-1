Rings of Saturn and the Authorized Version

Some years ago, a NASA space probe gave the world its first close-up of
the rings of Saturn. Prior to this the nature and structure of these rings
were thought to be fairly straightforward. In fact, it was shown to be
quite the opposite! Not only did the rings orbit Saturn, but the rings
themselves contained orbiting "rings." They displayed a previously
unimagined complexity. But the closer one looks, the more it reveals the
hand of God. It bears witness to the fact that indeed it is the
fulfillment of God's promise to preserve His original work of inspiration.
Far from its "problem passages" revealing any deficiency; under scrutiny,
these reveal "dust of gold" (Job 28:6). And what is more, they test the
heart and motives of all who come to its pages! - Jack A. Moorman, Conies,
Brass, and Easter: Answers to `Problem' Passages in the Authorized Version
