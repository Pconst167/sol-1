        It is a known fact that every language has one or more 
        terms that are used in reference to God and sometimes to 
        lesser deities. This is not the case with Allah. Allah is 
        the personal name of the One true God. Nothing else can 
        be called Allah. The term has no plural or gender. This 
        shows its uniqueness when compared with the word god 
        which can be made plural, gods or feminine, goddess. It 
        is interesting to notice that Allah is the personal name 
        of God in Aramaic, the language of Jesus and a sister 
        language of Arabic. 
             
        The One true God is a reflection of the unique concept 
        that Islam associates with God. To a Muslim, Allah is 
        Almighty, Creator and Sustainer of the Universe, Who is 
        similar to nothing and nothing is comparable to Him. The 
        Prophet Muhammad was asked by his contemporaries about 
        Allah; the answer came directly from God Himself in the 
        form of a short chapter of the Quran, which is considered 
        the essence of the unity or the motto of monotheism. This 
        is chapter 112 which reads:
             
             In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 
             Say (O Muhammad) He is God the One God, the 
             Everlasting Refuge, who has not begotten, nor has 
             been begotten, and equal to Him is not anyone. 

        Some non-Muslims allege that God in Islam is a stern and 
        cruel God who demands to be obeyed fully. He is not 
        loving and kind. Nothing can be farther from truth than 
        this allegation. It is enough to know that, with the 
        exception of one, each of the 114 chapters of the Quran 
        begins with the verse: "In the name of God, the Merciful, 
        the compassionate." In on of the sayings of Prophet 
        Muhammad (peace be upon him) we are told that "God is 
        more loving and kinder than a mother to her dear child." 
             
        But God is also just. Hence evildoers and sinners must 
        have their share of punishment and the virtuous, His 
        bounties and favors. Actually God's attribute of Mercy 
        has full manifestation in His attribute of Justice. 
        People suffering throughout their lives for His sake and 
        people oppressing and exploiting other people all their 
        life should not receive similar treatment from their 
        Lord. Expecting similar treatment for them will amount to 
        negating the very belief in the accountability of man in 
        the Hereafter and thereby negating all the incentives for 
        a moral and virtuous life in this world. The following 
        Quranic verses are very clear and straightforward in this 
        respect. 
             
             Verily, for the righteous are gardens of Delight, in 
             the Presence of their Lord. Shall We then treat the 
             people of Faith like the people of Sin? What is the 
             matter with you? How judge you? (Quran 68:34-36) 

        Islam rejects characterizing God in any human form or 
        depicting Him as favoring certain individuals or nations 
        on the basis of wealth, power or race. He created the 
        human-beings as equals. They may distinguish themselves 
        and get His favor through virtue and piety only. 
             
        The concept that God rested in the seventh day of 
        creation, that God wrestled with one of His soldiers, 
        that God is an envious plotter against mankind, or that 
        God is incarnate in any human being are considered 
        blasphemy from the Islamic point of View.
             
        The unique usage of Allah as a personal name of God is a 
        reflection of Islam's emphasis on the purity of the 
        belief in God which is the essence of the message of all 
        God's messengers. Because of this, Islam considers 
        associating any deity or personality with God as a deadly 
        sin which God will never forgive, despite the fact He may 
        forgive all other sins. 
             
        The Creator must be of a different nature from the things 
        created because if he is of the same nature as they are, 
        he will be temporal and will therefore need a maker. It 
        follows that nothing is like Him. If the maker is not 
        temporal, then he must be eternal. But if he is eternal, 
        he cannot be caused, and if nothing caused him to come 
        into existence, nothing outside him causes him to 
        continue to exist, which means that he must be self-
        sufficient. And if he does not depend on anything for the 
        continuance of his own existence, then this existence can 
        have no end. The Creator is therefore eternal and 
        everlasting: 'He is the First and the Last'
             
        He is Self-sufficient or Self-subsistent or, to use a 
        Quranic term, Al-Qayyum. The Creator does not create only 
        in the sense of bringing things into being, He also 
        preserves them and takes them out of existence and is the 
        ultimate cause of whatever happens to them. 
             
             God is the creator of everything. He is the guardian 
             over everything. Unto Him belong the keys of the 
             heavens and the earth (Quran 39:62,63)      
             No creature in there crawling on the earth, but its 
             provision rest on God. He knows its lodgingplace and 
             its repository (Quran 11:6). 

        
        
        GOD'S ATTRIBUTES 

        If the Creator is Eternal and Everlasting, then His 
        attributes must also be eternal and everlasting. He 
        should not lose any of His attributes nor acquire new 
        ones. If this is so, then His attributes are absolute. 
        Can there be more than one creator with such absolute 
        attributes? Can there be for example, two absolute 
        powerful creators? A moment's thought shows that this is 
        not feasible. 

        The Quran summarizes this argument in the following 
        verses:
             
             God has not taken to Himself any son, nor is there 
             any god with Him: For then each god would have taken 
             of that which he created and some of them would have 
             risen up over others (Quran 23:91). 
             And Why, were there gods in earth and heaven other 
             than God, they (heaven and earth) would surely go to 
             ruin (Quran 21:22). 



        THE ONENESS OF GOD 

        The quran reminds us of the falsity of all alleged gods. 
        To the worshippers of man-made objects it asks: Do you 
        worship what you have carved yourself (Quran 37:95) or 
        have you taken unto you others beside Him to be your 
        protectors, even such as have no power either for good or 
        for harm to themselves? (Quran 13:16). 

        To the worshippers of the heavenly bodies it cites the 
        story of Abraham:
             
             When night outspread over him he saw a star and 
             said, "This is my Lord." But when it set he said, "I 
             love not the setters." When he saw moon rising, he 
             said, "This is my Lord." But when it set he said: 
             "If my Lord does not guide me I shall surely be of 
             the people gone astray." When he say the sun rising, 
             he said, "This is my lord; this is greater." But 
             when it set he said, "O my people, surly I quit that 
             which you associate, I have turned my face to Him 
             who originated the heavens and the earth; a man of 
             pure faith, I am not of the idolators." 
             (Quran 6:76-79) 



        THE BELIEVER'S ATTITUDE
             
        In order to be a Muslim i.e., to surrender oneself to 
        God, it is necessary to believe in the oneness of God, in 
        the sense of His being the only Creator, Preserver, 
        Nourisher, etc.. But this belief - later on called 
        "Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah" is not enough. Many of the 
        idolaters knew and believe that only the supreme God 
        could do all this. But that was not enough to make them 
        Muslims. To 'tawhid ar-rububiyyah,' one must add 'tawhid 
        al'uluhiyyah' i.e., one acknowledges the fact that it is 
        God alone who deserves to be worshipped, and thus 
        abstains from worshiping any other thing or being 
             
        Having achieve this know;edge of the one true God, man 
        should constantly have faith in Him, and should allow 
        nothing to induce him to deny truth.
             
        When faith enters a person's heart, it causes certain 
        mental states which result in certain actions. Taken 
        together these mental states and actions are the proof 
        for the true faith. The Prophet said, "Faith is that 
        which resides firmly in the heart and which is proved bu 
        deeds."
             
        Foremost among those mental states is the feeling of 
        gratitude towards God, which could be said to be the 
        essence of 'ibada' (worship). 

        The feeling of gratitude is so important that a non 
        believer is called 'kafir', which means 'one who denies a 
        truth' and also 'one who is ungrateful.'
             
        A believer loves, and is grateful to God for the bounties 
        He bestowed upon him, but being aware of the fact that 
        his good deeds, whether mental or physical, are far from 
        being commensurate with divine favors, he is always 
        anxious lest God should punish him, here or in the 
        Hereafter. He, therefore, fears Him, surrenders himself 
        to Him and serves Him with great humility. One cannot be 
        in such a mental state without being almost all the time 
        mindful of God. Remembering God is thus the life force of 
        faith, without which it fades and withers away. 

        The Qur'an tries to promote this feeling of gratitude by 
        repeating the attributes of God very frequently. We find 
        most of these attributes mentioned together in the 
        following verses of the Qur'an: 

             He is God; there is no God but He. He is the Knower 
             of the unseen and the visible; He is the All-
             merciful, the All-compassionate. He is God; there is 
             no God but He. He is the King, the All-holy, the 
             All-peace, the Guardian of faith, the All-preserver, 
             the All-mighty, the All-compeller, the All-sublime. 
             Glory be to God, above that they associate! He is 
             God the Creator, the Maker, the Shaper. To Him 
             belong the Names Most Beautiful. All that is in the 
             heavens and the earth magnifies Him; He is the All-
             mighty, the All-wise (Quran 59:22-24). 

             There is no God but He, the living the Everlasting. 
             Slumber seize him not, neither sleep; to Him belongs 
             all that is in the heavens and the earth. Who is 
             there that shall intercede with Him save by His 
             leave? He knows what lies before them and what is 
             after them, and they comprehend not anything of His 
             knowledge save such as He wills. His throne 
             comprises the heavens and earth; the preserving of 
             them oppresses Him not; He is the All-high, the All-
             glorious (Quran 2:255). 

             People of the Book, go not beyond the bounds in your 
             religion, and say not as to God but the truth. The 
             Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was only the messenger 
             of God, and His Word that He committed to Mary, and 
             a spirit from Him. So believe in God and His 
             messengers, and say not, "Three." Refrain; better is 
             it for you. God is only one God. Glory be to Him - 
             (He is) above having a son (Quran 4:171).
