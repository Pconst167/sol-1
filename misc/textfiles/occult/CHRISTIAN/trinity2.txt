                                   God is ONE                    1/AV




          Deuteronomy 6:4 

           4. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God [is] one LORD:

          Deuteronomy 32:17 

           17  They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom
          they knew not, to new [gods that] came newly up, whom your
          fathers feared not.

          2 Samuel 7:22 

           22  Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for [there is]
          none like thee, neither [is there any] God beside thee,
          according to all that we have heard with our ears.

          Isaiah 43:10 

           10  Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant
          whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and
          understand that I [am] he: before me there was no God
          formed, neither shall there be after me.

          Isaiah 44:6 

           6  Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer
          the LORD of hosts; I [am] the first, and I [am] the last;
          and beside me [there is] no God.

          Isaiah 44:8 

           8  Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee
          from that time, and have declared [it]? ye [are] even my
          witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, [there is] no God;
          I know not [any].

          Isaiah 45:5 

           5. I [am] the LORD, and [there is] none else, [there is] no
          God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
           6  That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from
          the west, that [there is] none beside me. I [am] the LORD,
          and [there is] none else.

          Isaiah 45:21 

           21  Tell ye, and bring [them] near; yea, let them take
          counsel together: who hath declared this from ancient time?
          [who] hath told it from that time? [have] not I the LORD?
          and [there is] no God else beside me; a just God and a
          Saviour; [there is] none beside me.

          # Tit 2.13 2Pe 1.1
          
          There is NO other Saviour besides God.  In the passages



                                   God is ONE                    2/AV


          cited above, Christ is referred to as Saviour; a direct
          implication of His divinity in the NT.
           
           22  Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the
          earth: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else.

          Isaiah 46:9 

           9  Remember the former things of old: for I [am] God, and
          [there is] none else; [I am] God, and [there is] none like
          me,
           10  Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient
          times [the things] that are not [yet] done, saying, My
          counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

          Galatians 4:8 

           8. Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto
          them which by nature are no gods.

          Hebrews 6:13 

           13  For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could
          swear by no greater, he sware by himself,

                                 God is TRIUNE                   1/AV




          Genesis 1:26 

           26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
          likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the
          sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and
          over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
          creepeth upon the earth.

          "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:"  The two
          "ours" here can only be speaking of Angels and God, OR the
          triune Godhead alone.
          
          Since man was made a little lower than the Angels (Ps 8.4-5)
          as was the form of flesh Christ occupied (Hebrews 2.7), then
          God could not be indicating he made man after the
          "image" and "likeness" of angels.
          
          Further, "let us make man" could not include angels, because
          they are not creative beings.  God is the only Creator.
          Therefore, the "us" must speak only of God as a Creator of
          man in His "image" and "likeness".
           

          Genesis 11:7 

           7  Go to, let us go down, and there confound their
          language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

          Psalms 110:1 

           1. A Psalm of David. The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou
          at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

          # Mt 22.44 Lu 20.42 Act 2.34
           

          Isaiah 48:16 

           16. Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken
          in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was,
          there [am] I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath
          sent me.

          Matthew 22:44 

           44  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
          till I make thine enemies thy footstool?

          # Ps 110.1



                                 God is TRIUNE                   2/AV




          Matthew 28:19 

           19  Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them
          in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
          Ghost:

          Notice "name", not names.  The singular use of name for the
          authority of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit alludes to
          unity of essence and nature.
           

          Luke 1:35 

           35  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy
          Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
          shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
          shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

          Luke 20:42 

           42  And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD
          said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,

          # Ps 110.1
           

          Acts 2:34 

           34  For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he
          saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my
          right hand,

          # Ps 110.1
           

          Romans 15:30 

           30. Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus
          Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye
          strive together with me in [your] prayers to God for me;

          1 Corinthians 12:4 

           4  Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
           5  And there are differences of administrations, but the
          same Lord.
           6  And there are diversities of operations, but it is the
          same God which worketh all in all.


                                 God is TRIUNE                   3/AV




          2 Corinthians 13:14 

           14  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
          God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, [be] with you all.
          Amen.

          Galatians 4:6 

           6  And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit
          of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.

          # 1co 6.19
          
          God has sent the Spirit of his Son to dwell in the same
          place which is earlier called the Temple of the Holy Spirit.
           

          Ephesians 4:4 

           4  [There is] one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are
          called in one hope of your calling;
           5  One Lord, one faith, one baptism,
           6  One God and Father of all, who [is] above all, and
          through all, and in you all.

          # 1co 6.19 Gal 4.6
          
          Previously, both the Spirit of the Son and the Holy Spirit
          are said to reside in the believer.
           

          Hebrews 9:14 

           14  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
          the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,
          purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
          God?

          The "eternal" Spirit.  The Holy Spirit is eternal, and
          therefore must be divine.
           

          1 John 5:7 

           7  For there are three that bear record in heaven, the
          Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are
          one.

                                  God the Son                    1/AV




          Isaiah 9:6 

           6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and
          the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name
          shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The
          everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.

          # is 10.21
          
          The term "mighty God" is used of Christ here in Is 9.6 as
          well as Is 10.21 which is a direct reference to Jehovah.
          Both hebrew words are "El Gibbor"
           

          John 1:1 

           1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
          God, and the Word was God.

          John 1:3 

           3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any
          thing made that was made.

          # he 3.4
          
          God/Christ are creator.
           

          John 1:14 

           14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and
          we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of
          the Father,) full of grace and truth.

          John 1:18 

           18  No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten
          Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared
          [him].

          Most mss. read "only begotten God".
           

          John 1:23 

           23  He said, I [am] the voice of one crying in the
          wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the
          prophet Esaias.

          All mss say "way of our God".



                                  God the Son                    2/AV




          John 5:18 

           18  Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because
          he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God
          was his Father, making himself equal with God.

          # Joh 19.7
          
          JW's will say this is John quoting the Jews'
          misunderstanding of what Jesus was claiming to be.
          
          Rather, John is saying that he is an eyewitness account that
          Christ made these claims directly.  Diagramming the sentence
          in Greek, or English, brings this out.
           

          John 5:23 

           23  That all [men] should honour the Son, even as they
          honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth
          not the Father which hath sent him.

          John 8:58 

           58  Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
          Before Abraham was, I am.

          # ex 3.14 de 32.39
          
          "I am", "Ego eimi"
          
          If Jesus was only pointing to the fact that he was before
          abraham, he would have said "Ego en", which means "I was".
          Instead, he is alluding Ex 3.14 and the Greek Septuagint,
          which says "Ho on", which is from the same verb "to be".
           

          John 10:30 

           30  I and [my] Father are one.

          The word for "one" in Greek is neuter and is "hen".  The
          masculine would be "heis".  The neuter indicates oneness of
          essence.  The masculine, oneness of person.
           

          John 14:14 

           14  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do [it].

          Most mss say "ask me any thing in my name,...".



                                  God the Son                    3/AV




          John 17:5 

           5  And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self
          with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.

          # is 42.8
           

          John 18:5 

           5  They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto
          them, I am [he]. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood
          with them.

          "He" is not in the text.  Christ is indicating that he is
          the great "I am".
           

          John 19:7 

           7  The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he
          ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.

          John 20:28 

           28  And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my
          God.

          "Ho Kyrios mou kai ho theos mou."
          
          "The Lord of me and the God of me."
          
          Jesus surely would have rebuked him for this.  But rather
          encourages the response as valid.
           

          1 Corinthians 12:3 

           3  Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking
          by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no
          man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

          "Lord", "Kyrios".
          
          Kyrios is the Greek rendering of the tetragrammaton.
           

          Philippians 2:10 

           10  That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of
          [things] in heaven, and [things] in earth, and [things]
          under the earth;


                                  God the Son                    4/AV




          Colossians 1:15 

           15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of
          every creature:

          "firstborn" = "prototokos" here means "preeminent one".
          
          Compare Ge 41.51-52. with Jer 31.9
          
          In Ge 41.51 the "firstborn" is Manasseh.  In vs 52 the
          second born is Ephraim.  Jer 31.9 calls Ephraim "my
          firstborn".
          
          Ephraim, although second born, was called firstborn in the
          sense of having preeminence.
          
          If Paul would have meant that Jesus was the first one
          created he would have use the word "protoktisis", meaning
          first one created.
           
           16  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven,
          and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether [they
          be] thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all
          things were created by him, and for him:
           17  And he is before all things, and by him all things
          consist.

          Colossians 1:19 

           19  For it pleased [the Father] that in him should all
          fullness dwell;

          "fullness"
          
          Vine's calls this fullness "God, the completeness of his being".
          Vine's Expository Dictionary, Vol II, pg. 136.
           

          Colossians 2:9 

           9  For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
          bodily.

          "For in him all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily
          form". (NASB)
          
          JW's mistranslate this to mean "divine quality" rather than
          a direct reference to the nature of God in Christ.  For
          definition of the word Godhead, see Vine's Expository Dict.,
          Vol I, pg 328.

          Titus 2:13 

           13  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious
          appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

          # 2pe 1.1 Is 45.21

          The word "our" is not justified in the Greek as is mistakenly

          Hebrews 1:3 

           3  Who being the brightness of [his] glory, and the express
          image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of
          his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down
          on the right hand of the Majesty on high;

          "person" mistranslation.. s/b "substance".
          
          No creation is the exact image of God's person (substance).
          
          "'Image' is from the word 'charakter' which denotes a tool
          for graving, then a stamp or impress as on a coin or a seal,
          in which case the seal or die which makes an impression
          bears the image produced by it, and visa versa.  All the
          features of the image correspond respectively with those of
          the instrument producing it."  Vine's Expository Dict., Vol

                              God the Holy Spirit                1/AV




          Matthew 12:31 

           31  Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and
          blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy
          [against] the [Holy] Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

          Only blasphemy against God could incur such an absolute lack
          of opportunity for forgiveness.  The Holy Spirit holds
          special office as the convictor of mens' souls.
           
           32  And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man,
          it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the
          Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this
          world, neither in the [world] to come.

          Luke 1:35 

           35  And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy
          Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest
          shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which
          shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

          John 14:16 

           16  And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you
          another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;

          "Another" in Greek denotes another of the same (Allos), as
          opposed to another of a different kind (Heteros).  Vine's
          Expository Dict., Vol I.
           

          Acts 5:3 

           3  But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine
          heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back [part] of
          the price of the land?

          
           
           4  Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it
          was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou
          conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto
          men, but unto God.

          Lying to the Holy Spirit was equivalent to lying to God (see
          prior verse).



                              God the Holy Spirit                2/AV




          1 Corinthians 6:19 

           19  What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the
          Holy Ghost [which is] in you, which ye have of God, and ye
          are not your own?

          # 1co 3.16
          
          1Co 3.16 calls the body temple of God.  This is the same
          body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit in this passage.
           

          1 Corinthians 12:7 

           7  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every
          man to profit withal.

          God can only give spiritual gifts.
           
           8  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to
          another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
           9  To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the
          gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
           10  To another the working of miracles; to another
          prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another
          [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of
          tongues:
           11  But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
          dividing to every man severally as he will.

          2 Corinthians 3:17 

           17  Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of
          the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.

          The Lord (Kyrios) is called "Spirit" and the Spirit is called
          "Kyrios".
           
           18  But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
          glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from
          glory to glory, [even] as by the Spirit of the Lord.

          Hebrews 9:14 

           14  How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through
          the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God,
          purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living
          God?

          The "eternal" Spirit.  The Holy Spirit is eternal, and
          therefore must be divine.
