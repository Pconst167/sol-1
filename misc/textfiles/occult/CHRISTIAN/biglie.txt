 
                                 THE BIG LIE!
 
        The Bible warns that before the return of the Lord Jesus at the
   consummation of this age there will be a manifestation of the powers of
   darkness on earth.  Satan and his demons will perform 'signs and lying
   wonders' with the goal of deceiving mankind.  The Bible says: "And then
   shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the
   spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:
   Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and
   signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness
   in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth,
   that they might be saved.  And for this cause God shall send them strong
   delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned
   who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness"
   (2 Thess. 2:8-12).
 
        There is a great deception coming into the world.  All who reject
   the truth of the Gospel of salvation by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
   will believe this lie.  Could UFO's and contact with alien beings be a
   part of this deception?  I think it is!  The following are the major
   beliefs or Theology of UFO'ology:
   1)  God is not a personal being.  God is an impersonal force
   2)  The Bible is not God's only revelation to man
   3)  The Lord Jesus Christ is not the only Saviour
   4)  There is no eternal punishment or hell
   5)  There is no resurrection from the dead
   6)  Man himself can evolve from planet to planet to perfection
       by reincarnation
 
        The nature of UFO'ology can also be seen in that the world of the
   occult (psychics, mediums, etc.) has embraced UFO's and contact with
   'alien beings'.  The occultists frequently speak about our 'friendly'
   space brothers who wish to help mankind with their superior knowledge and
   technology.
 
        The Bible warns: "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the
   latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
   spirits, and doctrines of devils" (1 Tim. 4:1).  The theology of
   UFO'ology is contradictory and hostile to Biblical Christianity.
 
                            YOU MUST MAKE A CHOICE!
   "...choose you this day whom ye will serve;...but as for me and my house,
   we will serve the Lord" (Josh.  24:15).
 
   "NEITHER IS THERE SALVATION IN ANY OTHER: FOR THERE IS NONE OTHER NAME
   UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN, WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED" (Acts 4:12).
 
                                The Bible says:
 
   ALL HAVE SINNED: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of
   God;" (Rom. 3:23).
 
   SIN HAS A PENALTY: "The soul that sinneth it shall die..." (Ezek. 18:20).
   "...except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish" (Luke 13:3).
 
   THE LORD JESUS PAID THE PENALTY: "But he was wounded for our
   transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of
   our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (Isa. 53:5).
 
   YOU MUST RECEIVE THE LORD JESUS: "But as many as received him, to them
   gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
   name" (John 1:12).
 
                                SINNERS PRAYER
 
        Lord Jesus, I confess that I am a sinner.  I ask you to come into my
   life to forgive and save me.  I now receive You as my Saviour (trusting
   in You ALONE to save me) and my Lord (making You my Master and committing
   my life to You).
