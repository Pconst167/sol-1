Will this do?  I put it together myself





Contradictions -- The Bible is riddled with repetitions and

contradictions, things that the Bible bangers would be quick to point

out in anything that they want to criticize. For instance, Genesis 1

and 2 disagree about the order in which things are created, and how

satisfied God is about the results of his labors. The flood story is

really two interwoven stories that contradict each other on how many

of each kind of animal are to be brought into the Ark -- is it one

pair each or seven pairs each of the "clean" ones? The Gospel of John

disagrees with the other three Gospels on the activities of Jesus

Christ (how long had he stayed in Jerusalem -- a couple of days or a

whole year?) and all four Gospels contradict each other on the details

of Jesus Christ's last moments and resurrection. The Gospels of

Matthew and Luke contradict each other on the genealogy of Jesus

Christ'f father; though both agree that Joseph was not his real

father. Repetitions and contradictions are understandable for a

hodgepodge collection of documents, but not for some carefully

constructed treatise, reflecting a well-thought-out plan.



Of the various methods I've seen to "explain" these:

1. "That is to be taken metaphorically"  In other words, what is

   written is not what is meant.  I find this entertaining, especially

   for those who decide what ISN'T to be taken as other than the

   absolute WORD OF GOD - which just happens to agree with the

   particular thing they happen to want...



2. "There was more there than...."  This is used when one verse says

   "there was a" and another says "there was b", so they decide there

   was "a" AND "b" -which is said nowhere.  This makes them happy,

   since it doesn't say there WASN'T "a+b".  But it doesn't say there

   was "a+b+litle green martians".  This is often the same crowd that

   insists theirs is the ONLY possible interpretation (i.e. only "a")

   and the only way.  I find it entertaining they they don't mind

   adding to verses.



3. "It has to be understood in context"  I find this amusing because it

   comes from the same crowd that likes to push likewise extracted verses

   that support their particular view.  Often it is just one of the

   verses in the contradictory set is suppose to be taken as THE TRUTH

   when if you add more to it it suddenly becomes "out of context".

   How many of you have goten JUST John 3:16 (taken out of all context)

   thrown up at you?



4. "there was just a copying/writing error"  This is sometimes called

    a "transcription error", as in where one number was meant and an

    incorrect one was copied down.  Or that what was "quoted" wasn't

    really what was said, but just what the author thought was said when

    he thought it was said.  And that's right - I'm not disagreeing with

    events, I'm disagreeing with what is WRITTEN.  Which is apparently

    agreed that it is incorrect.  This is an amusing misdirection to the

    problem that the bible itself is wrong.



5. "That is a miracle".  Naturally.  That is why it is stated as fact.



6. "God works in mysterious ways"  A useful dodge when the speaker doesn't

   understand the conflict between what the bible SAYS and what they WISH

   it said.

A good source of _literal_ Biblical self-contradictions is (surprise)

"Self-Contradictions of the Bible", written by William Henry Burr in

1859 as a response to fundamentalism.  It is currently published by

Prometheus Books, 700 East Amherst St., Buffalo, NY 14215.  P.B. also

publishes a large number of books on religious inquiry and biblical

critiques, the majority of which have a humanistic/atheistic slant.

As far as "Self-Contradictions ..." goes, it contains about 140 textual

inconsistencies, classified under "Theological Doctrines", "Moral Precepts",

"Historical Facts", and "Speculative Doctrines."  

=============================================================================

"The Bible Handbook" is a compilation of several previous works by several 

authors, including W P Ball, G W Foote, and John Bowden.  Also, the writing 

by Mr Foote is dated 1900, so we see that this is not a new endeavor.  

_The Bible Handbook_ by W.P. Ball, et al., available for nine dollars from the

the American Atheist Press, P.O. Box 2117, Austin TX 78768-2117.  It's a

collection of biblical contradictions, absurdities, atrocities, immoralities,

indecencies, obscenities, unfulfilled prophecies and broken promises.  This

372-page volume will give the atheist tons of scriptural ammunition for

shooting down the flimsy arguments of the reality impaired.

ACT 2:30  Therefore being a prophet, and  knowing  that  God  had

cording to the flesh, he would raise up  Christ  to  sit  on  his

throne;



MAT 1:18  Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as

>Rabbits do not chew their cud.



LEV 11:6  And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but  divideth

not the hoof; he is unclean unto you.



'Gerah', the term which appears in the MT means (chewed) cud, and

also perhaps grain, or berry (also a 20th of a sheckel, but I think

that we can agree that that is irrelevant here). It does *not* mean

dung, and there is a perfectly adequate Hebrew word for that, which 

could have been used. Furthermore, the phrase translated 'chew the cud'

in the KJV is more exactly 'bring up the cud'. Rabbits do not bring

up anything; they let it go all the way through, then eat it again.

The description given in Leviticus is inaccurate, and that's that.

Rabbits do eat their own dung; they do not bring anything up and

chew on it.

=============================================================================

> Insects do NOT have four feet.



LEV 11:21  Yet these may ye eat of every  flying  creeping  thing

that  goeth  upon  all four, which have legs above their feet, to

leap withal upon the earth;

LEV 11:22  Even these of them ye may eat; the  locust  after  his

kind,  and  the  bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after

his kind, and the grasshopper after his kind.

LEV 11:23  But all other flying creeping things, which have  four

feet, shall be an abomination unto you.

>Snails do not melt.



PSA 58:8  As a snail which melteth, let every one  of  them  pass

the sun.

>fowl from waters or ground?



GEN 1:20  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the

moving  creature  that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the

earth in the open firmament of heaven.

GEN 1:21  And God created great whales, and every living creature

that  moveth,  which  the  waters brought forth abundantly, after

their kind, and every winged fowl after his  kind:  and  God  saw

that it was good.



GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast

of  the  field,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto

Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called

every living creature, that was the name thereof.

} order of creastion

Here is the order in the first (Genesis 1), the Priestly tradition:



Day 1: Sky, Earth, light

Day 2: Water, both in ocean basins and above the sky(!)

Day 3: Plants

Day 4: Sun, Moon, stars (as calendrical and navigational aids)

Day 5: Sea monsters (whales), fish, birds, land animals,

creepy-crawlies (reptiles, insects, etc.)

Day 6: Humans (apparently both sexes at the same time)

Day 7: Nothing (the Gods took the first day off anyone ever did)



	Note that there are "days", "evenings", and "mornings" before

the Sun was created. Here, the Deity is referred to as "Elohim", which

is a plural, thus the literal translation, "the Gods". In this tale,

the Gods seem satisfied with what they have done, saying after each

step that "it was good".



The second one (Genesis 2), the Yahwist tradition, goes:



Earth and heavens (misty)

Adam, the first man (on a desolate Earth)

Plants

Animals

Eve, the first woman (from Adam's rib)



=============================================================================

How orderly were things created?

#1: Step-by-step. The only discrepancy is that there is no Sun or Moon

or stars on the first three "days".

#2: God fixes things up as he goes. The first man is lonely, and is

not satisfied with animals. God finally creates a woman for him.

(funny thing that an omniscient god would forget things)

=============================================================================

How satisfied with creation was he?

#1: God says "it was good" after each of his labors, and rests on the

seventh day, evidently very satisfied.

#2: God has to fix up his creation as he goes, and he would certainly

not be very satisfied with the disobedience of that primordial couple.

(funny thing that an omniscient god would forget things)

Matt.27:46,50: "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 

saying, "Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?" that is to say, "My God, my God, why hast

thou forsaken me?"  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice, yielded u

the ghost."



Luke23:46: "And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, "Father, unto 

thy hands I commend my spirit:" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost."

>years of famine



II SAMUEL 24:13: So God came to David, and told him, and said unto him, shall

SEVEN YEARS OF FAMINE come unto thee in thy land? or will thou flee three

months before thine enemies, while they pursue. thee?



I CHRONICLES 21:11:  SO God came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the 

LORD, Choose thee. Either THREE YEARS OF FAMINE or three months to be destryed

before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee;

>The GENEALOGY OF JESUS?

In two places in the New Testament the genealogy of Jesus son of Mary (PBUH)

is mentioned. Matthew 1:6-16 and Luke 3:23-31. Each gives the ancestors of

Joseph the CLAIMED husband of Mary and Step father of Jesus(PBUH). The first

one starts from Abraham(verse 2) all the way down to Jesus. The second

one from Jesus all the way back to Adam. The only common name to these two

lists between David and Jesus is JOSEPH, How can this be true?  and also

How can Jesus have a genealogy when all Muslims and most Christians believe

that Jesus had/has no father.

=============================================================================

>God be seen?

 Exod. 24:9,10; Amos 9:1; Gen.  26:2; and John 14:9

	"And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my backparts."

	(Ex. 33:23)

	"And the Lord spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his

	friend." (Ex. 33:11)

	"For I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved." 

	(Gen. 32:30)

God CANNOT be seen:

	"No man hath seen God at any time." (John 1:18)

	"And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for there shall no man

	see me and live." (Ex. 33:20)

	"Whom no man hath seen nor can see." (1 Tim. 6:16)

=============================================================================

>CRUEL, UNMERCIFUL, DESTRUCTIVE, and FEROCIOUS or KIND, MERCIFUL, and GOOD:

	"I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy." (Jer. 13:14)

	"Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and

	spare them not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling."



	"The Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy." (James 5:11)

	"For his mercy endureth forever." (1 Chron. 16:34)

	"The Lord is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his 

	works." (Ps. 145:9)

	"God is love." (1 John 4:16)

=============================================================================

>tempts?

	"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham."

	(Gen 22:1)



	"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God 

	cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man." (James 1:13)

=============================================================================

>Judas died how?

	"And he cast down the pieces of silver into the temple and departed,

	and went out and hanged himself." (Matt. 27:5)



	"And falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his

	bowels gushed out." (Acts 1:18)

=============================================================================

> ascend to heaven

	"And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." (2 Kings 2:11)



	"No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven,

	... the Son of Man." (John 3:13)

What was Jesus' prediction regarding Peter's denial?

 

Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34

 

Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30

=============================================================================

 

>How many times did the cock crow?



MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to

mind  the  word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow

twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he

wept.



MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know

not the man. And immediately the cock crew.

MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said

unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he

went out, and wept bitterly.



LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And

immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.

LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter

remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before

the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.



JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my

sake?  Verily,  verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow,

still thou hast denied me thrice.



JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock

crew.

>who killed Saul



SA1 31:4  Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw  thy  sword,

and  thrust  me  through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come

and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his  armourbearer  would

not;  for  he  was  sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and

fell upon it.

SA1 31:5  And when his armourbearer saw that Saul  was  dead,  he

fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

SA1 31:6  So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer,

and all his men, that same day together.





SA2 1:15  And David called one of the young  men,  and  said,  Go

near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

seed  remaineth  in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of

God.

MAT 27:6  And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said,

It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is

MAT 27:7  And  they  took  counsel,  and  bought  with  them  the

potter's field, to bury strangers in.
