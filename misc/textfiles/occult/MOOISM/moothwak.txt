The secret inner core of the MOOist church.  They live in shadows, and never
brush their teeth...  They are (dramatic music) The Unthwakables.

Lurking in darkness, the unthwakables perform strange and mysterious rites for
their ring leader, one Mr Half Mad.

Armed only with wet sponges, the unthwakables are calm, cool, and completely
psychotic.  

They feed off your lack of fear.

They wear funny hats.

They know when you are sleeping, and they'll guess when you're awake about 50%
of the time.

They are, the unthwakables!

They carve soap into funny animal shapes.

They haunt you like the plague.

They feed your pets rare and disaterous herbs that cause your pets excretions
to be bright beige.

They are, the unthwakables.
