                        Proclamation â-1
                        Carrot Divination

   Hi, and welcome to the exciting world of the MOO-COW Gamma series of High
Preest revelations, proclamations, stipulations, exacerbations, and
aggravations.
In this proclamation, we will explore the wonderful new vision of the Carrot
deck, as revealed to Floyd Gecko after a hideous tarot-MAO game (if you don't
know, DON'T ASK)...

   Part One:  Tarot/Carrot

   The MOOish peoples will shortly have long had a retroactive tradition of
Carrot Divination, using the mystical system of the Carrot Deck, somewhat
related
to the Tarot Deck of many other peoples.  As the Tarot Deck may be related to
the
Kabbalah, so may the Carrot Deck be related to the Kobbler.  However, the
Carrot Deck is far more sophisticated than the Tarot Deck, as it allows
divination to proceed through the mind of the interpreter, a far more flexible
device than a deck of cards.  To wit, the reader simply makes up an
explanation.
Its structure is indicated below, as compared with that of the Tarot.  It is
clearly more sophisticated:

Tarot Structure:
Minor Arcana: 4 Suits with 14 cards each
Major Arcana: 22 cards with meaning
   Suits:  Cups, Swords, Disks, Wands
   Made Of:  1-10, Queen, Princess, Prince, Knight

Carrot Structure:
Short Arcana: 4 suits with 11 cards each
Tall Arcana: 23 cards with no meaning
Stoopid Arcana: 23 specific predictions
Major Inana: 1 Carte Blanche, 1 green card, 2 greeting cards, 1 punch card,
 2 credit cards, 2 Jokers, 1 Batman
Minor Inana:  The 4« of Forks
   Suits:  Cups, Knives, Plates, Spoons
   Made Of:  1, 6, 7, 8, Dopey, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Doc

               Part Two:  Doin' The Funky Carrot

   The correspondences of the Carrot Deck with the Tarot Deck are superficial
at best.  The Tarot Deck is composed of 78 meaningful cards, while the Carrot
Deck is composed of 101 meaningless cards, into which the interpreter can read
whatever is appropriate.  Some readers may find that certain meanings instantly
apply themselves to the cards, and start to use those.  This is foolish: the
Carrot Deck is completely meaningless and utterly useless as a divinatory tool.
   There are 46 cards not specified in the above listings, those of the Tall
Arcana and Stupid Arcana.  The Tall Arcana are based entirely on the Kobbler
Koncept, and are grouped into five groups.  They are as follows:

Halfy Group:  Happy, Sad, Confused, Alien.
Olypmpics:  Yes, No, Maybe, Summer, Winter
Venn Group:  2A, 2B, Not-2B
Pentagon:  Anarchy, Bureaucracy, Peace, Nothing, Copyright
Lumpy Group:  Plaid, Paisley, Taco, Elvis, 401
No Group:  Unsociable

   In order to increase the precision of this deck (if not the accuracy), the
Stoopid Arcana consists of 23 specific precictions, quotes, or commentaries,
corresponding to fundamental emmanations from the Carrot Sphere.  Thus, since
there's no such thing as a Carrot Sphere, these predictions, if they come true,
do so only by random chance:  "Beware Brick Lobbing Beavers", "Gilligan's
Island
Rerun's On At 7:00", "That Idiot Behind You Has A Gun", "There Is A Loaded GNU
Next Door", "There Are Squids Hiding In Your Underpants Drawer", "This Card Is
Temporarily Out Of Order", "Never Mind, Too Late", "Elvis Will Pay You A Visit
Soon", "Vote For Hellhound >101< In Whatever He Happens To Be Running For NOW",
"Ah, Blow It Out Your Ear, Cinnamon Feet", "Quid Pro Quo", "Stop Asking Me
Stupid
Questions, You Goof", "There Is A Bomb In Your Piano", "Your Head Would Make A
Good Paperweight", "Never Play Golf With A Lawnmower", "Contemplate Your
Navel...
Then Figure Out Why You Have One", "MOO", "The Price Of Linguini Noodles Will
Go
Up In The Near Future", "DUCK!", "DUCK!", "GOOSE!", "Your Elephant Will
Spontaneously Combust In The Near Future", and, of course, "Burrito-12".

   Part Four:  Interpreting A Carrot Reading

   Don't.

   Part Five:  Carrot Designs

   The design on the back of the cards should be a picture of a carrot, held
aloft among floating Knives, Spoons, Plates, and Cups, speared by a fork in the
midst of a bright light emmanating from a real huge lightbulb.  The pictures on
the faces are left to deck designers and other assorted deckhands.  The designs
should reflect the underlying order and symmetry of the philosophy behind the
deck.  To wit, none.  For this reason, the Carrot Deck has never actually been
designed, in keeping with this principle.  However, blasphemers and Gnu Popes
may
wish to create their own decks designs.  There has already been a proposal for
a Cyberspace Deck of the Carrot system, in which each card is replaced by a
floppy disk with a .GIF image of the card on it in 2023x2023x23-bit colour.
