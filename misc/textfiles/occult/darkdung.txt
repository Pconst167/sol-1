                               DARK DUNGEONS
                                 By J.T.C.
              (Adapted from comic-book form by J. Brad Hicks)

Around the dining room table in Ms. Frost's (the DM's) apartment, a group 
of teenagers were playing "Dark Dungeons".  Some were bored, others were 
worried.  The table was littered with soda cans and miniatures.  From 
behind the DM's screen, Ms. Frost said, "Okay, Wizard, cast your spell!" 

Debbie (Elfstar) replied, "Okay, Dungeon Master.  My spell of light blinds 
the monster." 

The DM nodded, and announced, "The thief, Black Leaf, did not find the 
poison trap, and I declare her dead." 

Marcie (Black Leaf) leapt up with panic written large on her face, and 
screamed, "NO, NOT BLACK LEAF!  NO, NO!  I'M GOING TO DIE!  Don't make me 
quit the game.  Please don't!  Somebody save me!  You can't do this!" 

Debbie sneared, "Marcie, get out of here.  YOU'RE DEAD!  You don't exist 
any more." 

Later, after the game, when they were alone, Ms. Frost confided, "Debbie, 
your cleric has been raised to the 8th level.  I think it's time you learn 
how to REALLY cast spells."  Debbie asked, incredulously, "You mean you're 
going to teach me how to have THE REAL POWER?" 

Ms. Frost smiled and replied, "Yes, you have the personality for it now." 

The intense occult training through D & D qualified Debbie to enter a 
witches' coven as a priestess.  Twelve people in robes stood inside a 
circle with a pentacle painted on the floor and an altar at the point.  
From outside the circle, Ms. Frost lead in Debbie, saying, "I've brought 
Elfstar to become a priestess and witch."  The man who met them at the 
circle's edge replied, "Welcome, Elfstar.  You're now a priestess of the 
craft, and of the Temple of Diana." 

Days later, in Ms. Frost's apartment, Debbie was jubilant.  "Ms. Frost, 
this is fantastic ... This makes the game REAL ... It's not a fantasy any 
more.  Last night I cast my FIRST spell ... This is REAL power!" 

Ms. Frost replied, approvingly, "I knew you were ready by the way you 
played the game ... but this is just the beginning.  There is so much more.  
Which spell did you cast, Debbie?" 

Debbie answered with a sinister grin, "I used the mind bondage spell on my 
father.  He was trying to stop me from playing D & D." 

That won another knowing smile from the Dungeon Master.  She asked, "What 
was the result?"  Debbie laughed and said, "He just bought me $200.00 worth 
of new D & D figures and manuals.  IT WAS GREAT!" 

Later that week, during a game, Ms. Frost answered the phone at her 
apartment, and turned to Elfstar.  "Hey, Debbie!  Marcie's on the phone.  
She wants to talk to you.  She's really upset." 

Debbie didn't even move to get up, but said instead, "I can't.  I'm 
fighting the Zombie.  Tell her I'll see her tonight." 

That night, at Marcie's house, Debbie said to Marcie's mother at the door, 
"Hi, Mrs. Anderson.  Marcie wanted me to see her tonight." 

Marcie's mother said, "I'm glad you're here, Debbie.  Marcie has shut 
herself in her room and won't come out.  She hasn't been herself for weeks.  
I've been very worried.  Ever since her character in the game got killed, 
it's as though a part of her died.  Maybe you can talk some sense into 
her." 

But it was not fated to be, for when she entered Debbie's room, she was 
instead greeted by the sight of Marcie, hanging dead from the light 
fixture, surrounded by her D & D figures.  "No, Marcie!  You didn't HAVE to 
do that!" sobbed Debbie.  The suicide note read, "It's my fault Black Leaf 
died.  I can't face life alone! - Marcie" 

Debbie ran to the DM with the news.  "Ms. Frost, I can't get Marcie out of 
my mind.  How could she do something like this?  If I'd left the game, 
she'd be alive today." 

For the first time that we'd seen, Ms. Frost was genuinely angry.  "Get 
your priorities straight, Debbie.  Your spiritual growth through the game 
is more important than some lousy loser's life.  It would have happened 
sooner or later.  Her character was too weak." 

Debbie replied, "But the law of our faith is that we can do anything we 
want as long as we harm no one.  But now we have harmed Marcie."  ("What 
have I gotten myself into?" she wondered to herself.) 

Ms. Frost shouted impatiently, "DON'T BE STUPID, DEBBIE.  I think you'd 
better let Elfstar take care of things.  You're getting out of control!" 

But now Debbie was frightened rather than sad, said, "I don't want to be 
Elfstar any more.  I want to be Debbie." 

Later, her handsome friend Mike found her crying in the park.  "Hey Debbie, 
what's wrong?  Can I help?" 

Debbie looks up, and answered, "I thought I had all the answers, Mike, but 
now everything is falling apart," and sobbed. 

Mike replied, "Debbie, I told you Jesus is the only answer.  I've been 
praying and fasting for you." 

Surprised, Debbie asked, "Why would you do that for me?" 

Mike said, "Because I know what you're involved in.  It's a spiritual 
warfare that you can't win without the Lord Jesus." 

Debbie asked, "What can I do?"

Mike answered, "Come with me to a meeting this afternoon.  The speaker came 
out of witchcraft and he knows what you're up against." 

That afternoon, the speaker took the pulpit and said, "You who are involved 
in the occult, think you have achieved power.  But you have been trapped in 
a dungeon of bondage.  The limited power you have been given is only bait 
to lure you to destruction.  But Jesus came that you might have life and 
that more abundantly." 

Gathering steam, he continued.  "Jesus sets us free from the bondage of 
witchcraft.  Jesus gives us power over all of the enemy and nothing shall 
by any means hurt you. [1]  You must fulfill Acts 2:38.  REPENT of the sins 
in your life and turn to Jesus as your Lord and Savior.  You must fulfill 
Acts 19:19.  Gather up all your occult paraphenalia like your rock music, 
occult books [2], charms, Dungeons and Dragons material.  Don't throw them 
away.  BURN THEM!  We'll do that here tonight.  Also tonight, we'll be 
praying for the deliverance of those who have allowed occult forces to 
control them." 

Raising his arms, he commanded, "If you want Jesus as your Lord, come 
forward now."  Startling the people around her, Debbie rose up in tears and 
cried, "Oh, God!  I need help ... My life's a mess.  HELP ME!" 

The evangelist placed his hands on Debbie's shoulders and said, "In the 
name of Jesus, I order [3] you spirits of the occult to leave Debbie."  
Debbie responded, "Jesus, I REPENT of my sins and I want you to be my 
Saviour and Lord.  You guide me through Life.  I want You to be in charge 
of everything ... not that lousy D & D manual." [4]  Over her shoulder, 
ghostly demons could be seen fleeing Debbie's body. 

Later that night, a crowd gathered around a huge pile of books and games.  
The evangelist struck a pose, and loudly proclaimed, "We take authority in 
the name of Jesus Christ through the power of his shed blood and bind the 
demonic forces in this filth of Satan!" 

The flames rose high into the night.  In the crowd behind him, Debbie said 
softly, "Thank you, Lord, for setting me free."

Adapter's note:  I think the factual errors in this piece speak for 
themselves.  Despite the claim that the speaker (Chick?) "came out of 
witchcraft," it's pretty obvious that Chick knows nothing of either The
