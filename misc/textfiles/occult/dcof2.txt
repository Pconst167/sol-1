      MAKING YOUR OWN PERSONALIZED DIVINING MACHINE/OUIJA BOARD
             --------------] WitchCraft [--------------
         )))))))))))))))))))))))))((((((((((((((((((((((((


  For divining on personal topics, make your instrument of a single
 hair from your own head, tying to one end of the hair a favorite ring
 or a button that you have worn many times. Attach the weight to the end
 of the hair and the other to your right index finger towards the tip.

 Arrange yours hands as follows, and be sure to work on a firm table
 because an unsteady one may contribute a motion of it's own and
 deceive you into misinterpreting the information that you receive.

 --Place the left hand in a fist on the table (thumb on top, little
   finger down), make a fist with the right hand but point out the
   index finger with the hair and weight attached to it and place
   atop the left fist.

  When everything is set, hold your hands still until the instrument
 has stopped swinging. Then say aloud:

             " Line,line,show to me.
               What the future is to be.
               Circle, show that that is to be.
               As I will, so mote it be."
  
 Then ask the instrument:
                          "High and mighty spirit force.
                           Art thou here to be my guide?"

 The instrument will normally respond by beginning to swing in a line,
 indicating 'yes'. If it does not respond, put it away and come back 21
 minutes later to try again. These early contacts between you and the
 spirit force are critical beyond any means we have to tell you.
 --Follow the instructions given here with total precision, or assume
 responsibility for what may happen yourself.

  Repeat the trial and invitation until you get results. In every case
 that we have dealt with, there has always been a positive answer
 within the mystic five trials.

  Once you receive a positive answer, construct the following chart:
                     
                         NORTH
                           <>
                     _________________
                    /       5         \
                   / 4 _____________6  \
                  /   /     |       \   \
          WEST<> / 3 /      |        \ 7 \ <>EAST
                /   /       |         \   \ 
               / 2 /        |          \ 8 \ <-----------------|                 
              /   /         |           \   \                  |
             / 1 /          |            \ 9 \                 |
            /   /           |             \   \                |
   SOUTH<> / 0 /------------+--------------\ 0 \ <>SOUTH       |
                                                               |_____
  Note: This is the basic drawing for the chart due to limited ascii |
        Grafix....so make the two inner arcs half circles instead of--
        being squared off!

  Now by holding your instrument over the chart, you can devine precise
 answers to your questions.
  --As an example:
       Lets say that you have lost your dog.
    Using your magical divining instrument, ask first:
       In what direction does the dog lie?.....Then ask,
       How far from here is the dog?.........
    In this manner you can pinpoint the dogs location.

  You may also ask where the location of any buried treasure is, or
 to find any lost object......the uses are limitless!!!!!

  Occasionally you will be led to suspect that your instrument is
 being controlled by some force of malicious intent because the answers
 seem to lead you astray deliberatley. At such a time it is well to
 construct a new instrument from new materials, then ask it questions
 to which you do not know the answer. Ascertain the answers later
 and judge the validity of the controlling force from how well it
 responded to you.

                 HOW TO CAUSE THE APPERANCE OF 3 LADYS
                     IN ONE'S ROOM AFTER SUPPER
                 -------------------------------------
                      -----] Black Magick [-----
                    
                   Taken from The Complete Grimorie



How to Cause the appearance of 3 Ladys in one's room:

I. Preperation.

Abstain for three days from drawing Mercury, and then you will rise
up. On the fourth day, you shall cleanse and prepare your chamber
as soon as it is morning, immidiately after dressing, the whole fasting.
But see you do it in such a way that it will not be liable to disarrangment
during the remainder of the day. Note that there must be no hangings, nor
anything set crosswise, no tapestries, no hanging clothes, hats, bird cages,
bed curtains, &c. Above all, put clean sheets on your couch.

II. Ceremony.

After supper pass in secret to your chamber, made ready as above; kindle a
good fire; place a white cloth on the table, round which is set three
chairs, and before each chair, upon the table, let there be a wheaton roll
and a glass full of fresh clear water. Lastly, draw up a chair and settee to
the side of the bed, and retire to rest, utter the following

                              CONJURATION

Bestictum consolatio veni ad me vertat Creon, Creon, Creon cantor laudem
omnipotentis et non commentur. Stat superior carta bient laudem omviestra
principiem da montem et inimicos meos o prostantis vobis et mihi dantes
que passium fieri sincisibus.

The three persons having arrived, will rest themselves near the fire,
drinking, eating, and finally thanking he who has entertained them. The
said three persons will draw lots among each other to know which of them
shall remain with you. She who wins will place herself in the arm-chair
which you have set by the bed, and she will remain and commune with you
until Midnight, at which hour she will depart with her companions, without
any need of dismissal. As regards the two others, they will keep themselves
by the fire, while the other entertains you. So as long as she remains you 
may question her upon any art or science, or upon what subject soever, and
she will immidiately give you a positive answer. You may also inquire of her
wether she is aware of any hidden treasure, and she will instruct you as to
its locality and the precise time suited to its removal. She will even appear
there with her companions to defend you against the assaults of the Infernal
Spirits who may have it in their possesion. At parting, she will present you
with a ring, which, worn on the finger, will render you lucky at play, while
if it be placed on the finger of any woman or girl, you shall there and then
have your delight with them. Observe, however, that you must leave your window
open in order that they may enter.
 This ceremony may be repeated frequently at the will of the Operator.

It must be acknowledged that the above experiment offers a large return for
very small pains in the preperation, and hence is very popular with the makers
of the Grimories.

            HOW TO MAKE VISIBLE THE 'SPIRITS' IN THE AIR
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       )) Black Magick ((


 * This experiment should be performed only by those who fear NOTHING!!


   Equipment: The brain of a cock (Dissection of the object may be
              performed by you, a poulters assistant or Kitchen Maid).

              The dust from the grave of a dead man; but to visit the
              nearest cemetery will not be sufficient, because it is
              useless to collect it on the surface, that which is next
              to the coffin will alone serve the purpose.

              Oil of Almonds

              Virgin Wax (or and Unused Natural Candle, non scented)


   A compost must be made of the four, and it must be wrapped in a 
   sheet of virgin Parchment inscribed previously with the words:
          GOMERT,KAILOETH , and with the character of Khil.

   The following is the Character of Khil:
                                   ...
                                  .   .
                            ...............
                           .     .   .     . 
                          .    ............
                           ....   . .
                                   
  Note: The dots represent solid lines, just draw lines to connect
        the dots together (this is all ascii will allow me!!)


   The materials thus prepared now remains to be set alight, burn the
   ingredients as prepared.

   The Operator will behold visions of all surrounding Spirits in
   the air......caution however must be taken as many of these
   beings are quite unsightly to the human eye and will try to cause
   fear within you. However some will be quite Magnificent and
   elaborate.

                   The 'Black Coffin' Death Spell
                  ---------] WitchCraft [---------


   Prior to Midnight on the dark of the Moon, burn some Black Arts
  Incense to summon dark forces for about a half hour before the ritual.

   Use no Invocation for this working and do everything by the light
  of a single black Candle that has been annointed with Black Arts
  Oil. By dim light and silence you summon the quiet of the grave.

   As the evil hour strikes all must be ready to proceed:
  Fashion a coffin by hand of warm black wax from a melted candle.
  Fashion also by hand from the same a small doll to represent thy
  victim and lay in the coffin.
  Scribe the victim's name on a piece of parchment in black ink and
  lay in the coffin next to the doll.
  Insert several large pins into the body of the doll with thy silent
  curse for the victim as each pin enters the body of the doll.
  Sprinkle the coffin and doll with Black Mus Powder and meditate on 
  the harm thou wouldst inflict on the victim.
  When the candle has burned to a stub( the one that was annointed ),
  put it out and repair to the victim's dwelling.
  Sprinkle more Black Mus Powder around the doorstep and set the coffin
  on it. Place the burned out stub next to the coffin and draw an:
  ' X X ' (just the x's) with some of the Black Arts Oil on the door.
  Throw a few pinches of the Black Mus Powder onto the Oil on the
  door so that it sticks and shows the ' X X '.

  It is best to do this when the victim is not at home, so that he/she
 may find the ghoulish work when they return.

  When all has been thus accomplished , maintain strict silence about
 thy work and never acknowledge the existence of the victim.

                     The Voodoo Death Doll Hex
                    -------) WitchCraft (------


    During the time of the Waning Moon, fashion a poppet from red wax
  and name it to be thy victim. Dress it with Destruction Oil and
  sprinkle it with some Damnation Powder.

    Await the time of the Dark of the Moon, and light a red candle
  and some XX Incense.

    In the flame of the candle heat a sharp thorn and insert it into
  the poppet's heart.

    As thou doest that sayest:
          I KILL, I KILL, I DRIVE THIS WEDGE
          TO FESTER AND MAIM
          UPON _______________ I WISH THE SAME.

    Heat up a sharp nail in the candle flame and drive it totally
  through the poppet's body so that it sticks out the back side.

    Hold the poppet by the nail and twirl it through the incense smoke
  as thou sayest:
          PAIN AND FEAR SHALL ALL BE HERE
          RUIN AND RACK ARE ON THE ATTACK.
          BRING DOWN THIS ONE TO THE GRAVE'S
          MOULDY ROT,NOTHING BUT THAT
          TO HIS/HER LOT.

    Bury the poppet in the earth for a month. Then exhume it on the
  Dark of the Moon.

    Scatter the Damnation Powder, the Destruction Oil and some rum
  onto the victim's doorstep and hammer the poppet into the door
  frame near the door knob.

    Try to accomplish this when the victim is out, if possible.

    One must be unseen doing all of this, or the work may fail.
