I hope the following information on Tesla books will be of interest to
some of you.

I recently purchased the following books from:
Lindsay Publications, PO Box 583, Manteno, IL 60950-0583, FAX: 815-468-3694
Their service was EXCELLENT!!
I have tagged each book with a brief "review." The opinions are my own.

Number  Title                                                   Cost

20404   Design & Construction of Induction Coils                $ 12.95
            Step-by-step guide to building your own induction
            coil. Reprint from early 20th century magazine project.
            Fascinating, but many turned brass parts, etc., probably
            make this project too hard for most.
 4392   Experiments With Alternate Currents of High Potential   $  9.95
            <not yet read>
20030   High Frequency Apparatus                                $ 11.95
            ,Very good general book on high frequency electricity.
  844   How to Build a 40,000 Volt Induction Coil               $  4.95
            A solid state design that uses a surplus auto ignition coil
            and a power transistor. Almost all Radio Shack parts.
            Small booklet. Some info on Kirlian photography, ozone
            production, etc. Interesting (and easy - no coil winding)
            project, but not a Tesla coil.
20544   Electricity at High Pressures & Frequencies             $ 11.95
            Reprint of old book. Contains very good introduction to
            basic electrical principles in early chapters. Lots of
            formulas, etc. Interesting, and good for theory.
 4953   High Power Wireless Equipment                           $  9.95
            Step-by-step process from old radio magazine on building
            an (illegal!) spark-gap transmitter. Nice historical
            information, fascinating processes and diagrams. Probably
            too hard for most people to actually build.
  748   Tesla's Lost Inventions                                 $  5.95
            Booklet. Sshort descriptions of several of
            Tesla's most interesting inventions, including turbines,
            etc. Good, but too short!

The following is a listing of books I got from CompuServe by checking the
keyword "Tesla" via their Books in Print ($$$) service. I didn't order the
full records as it was too costly, but this should give you some idea of
the titles currently available. I have deleted some titles that were
obvious duplicate listings (probably different editions from different
publishers). From the way the listings came up, it appears that there's
quite a bit of fluctuation in exact titles. For example, if you can't
locate "Tesla. Man Out of Time", you might try "Tesla: Man Out of Time".
Likewise "Dr. Nikola Tesla Bibliography" is probably equivalent to "Nikola
Tesla. A Bibliography", though I've listed both. Etc.
