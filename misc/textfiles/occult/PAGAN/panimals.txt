Come to us: Eagle, Wolf, Bear and Cougar.

Share with us freedom, majesty and fighting skills.

Dance with us The Power dances.
 
Wolf, cunning tracker, by day or night.  Share with us endurance,
courage and adaptability.
Teach us lessons we need to learn.  Dance with us The Power
dances.
 
Bear, trampling along earthen paths, Share with us Mighty
strength and sense of smell.
Teach us lessons we need to learn.  Dance with us The Power
dances.
 
Cougar, lonely tracker of terrains, Share with us Agility,
stamina and endless curiosity.  Teach us lessons we need to
learn.  Dance with us The Power dances.
 
Movements slow
Movements rapid.
Frenzied swaying
Upward, downward.
Dipping, turning
Round and round.
Dance we now
The Power dances.
 
Dancing partners,
You and I.
With me, in me
I am you, you are me.
Together as one,
Yet separate, too.
Dance we now
The Power dances.
 
Awaken now
All Spirit Beings,
To dance the dances
With your human kin.
 
Dance the Cycles
Of Life and Death,
Hope and Fear,
Good and Evil.
Dance the Cycles,
Now and Again.
 
Lowerworld, Upperworld,
Journeying now
and forevermore.
Of Time and Space
All is Once,
There is none.
Dance the dances
Again and again.   .......from R.M.P.J. 8/86
