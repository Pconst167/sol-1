                            The Magick Pantry

This post was written to assist those participating in the 
ASTRAL_GARDEN echo, or anyone for that matter that can benefit from 
its content.  If you haven't checked out the Astral_Garden echo, 
perhaps you would like to see what has brought all this on.  It is 
intended as a general reference to give those not familiar with a 
Magick Panty, what exacly it is, and what items might be included.  
Some of the items my not be considered ethically sound, so please 
use your own descretion and training to make these decisions.

Purpose and Directions:

The larder or Magick Pantry must be kept secret and secure. It is a 
place to store all of your magickal herbs and various plants that 
the magician needs to rely on in the day to day practice of magick. 
 It is a perfect accompinemt for the plants grown in your Magick 
Garden.

Find a cupboard or recess in the house, preferably one with a solid 
oak door.  Be careful not to let in too much light.  Damp must be 
kept out.  Open the door swiftly, put in and take out what is 
needed and close the door again.  Keep all the herbs separate and 
in labelled jars.  Rose water and orange water must be placed in 
earthenware pots since glass would allow the light to draw their 
potency.  Similarly, precious substances such as Ambergris and 
Caviare should be stored in boxes of Almond-Wood as this is the 
safest of all of the known woods.

To prepare well all spells and magick potions, the vessels, 
including mortar and pestle, spoons, and knives should be perfectly 
clean and in some cases brand new.  For the more demanding spells 
the utensils can be used only once.

More difficult spells or those requiring open cooking, may need the 
construction of a tripod of sticks from which to hang the pot.  
Keep a selection of Efficacious Sticks.  Elder, Almond, Oak, Apple, 
Rowan, Medlar, Vine, Cypress and Laurel branches can be gathered 
for this purpose.

For spells promising fertility and youth Hippomanes is needed. (Of 
course this is definately NOT used by all magicians, and therefore 
I'd suggest using your own descretion.)  This is the foamy white 
substance found on the head of a newly born foal.  The vital parts 
of a wolf as well as its skin, teeth and feet will be useful in 
many spells, particularly those warding off injury and attack.  To 
inspire, excite or please the pet cat, a supply of its favourite 
herb, Catnip is also needed.

For making spells stay or even last for ever, dissolved gold, 
silver and pearls are necessary.  To ease all pains, to secure 
death for oneself or to bring it under control and make a slave of 
it Hemlock is the classic herb.  It is said that to eat only a 
little of the herb will make someone your slave for life.  I don't 
know if that it actually the case, as I've never really wanted a 
slave, so I've never tried using it in this manner. <smile>

Varied additional supplies that are available thru some Herbalists 
and which are good for the Magick Pantry are: Camel Oil, Dragon's 
Blood, and Unicorn Milk (of course these are simply the man-made 
names)  Again, check with your local herbalist for recipes of this 
nature.  If you have recipes for either of these three, I'd 
certainly appreciate and welcome your posting them.

In the next post labeled "The Magick Pantry" you will see some of 
the herbs to include as well as their names and some of their 
magickal uses.  These are some of the most important ones to read: 
Marigold, Nettle, Wild Teasel, Celandine, Periwinkle, Pennyroyal, 
Houndstongue, Henbane, Lily, Mistletoe, Centuary, Sage, Vervain, 
Celery, Rose, and Snakeweed.

                       The Magick Pantry - Alchone

If this herb can be obtained, it must be kept and preserved as 
something precious.  It is the herb of the sun itself.  It can heal 
the passions and secret griefs of any sufferer.  It can also soothe 
the stomach.  Moreover, it increases a man's sexual potency if the 
juice is taken prudently.  To carry the root is tot keep the eyes 
free from infection or even from seeing anything to grieve them.  A 
little Alchone tucked inside a shirt will preserve the wearer from 
fits.  It is also an anti-congestant and an anti-depressant.

Your selection of canisters should be glass, and properly labeled.  
Remember, it is a very vital root for any magician to stock.

                     The Magick Pantry - Asphodel

This is the same beautiful flower that covered the fields of 
Elysium but it is useful, too.  It works best under the influence 
of Saturn, since it belongs to this planet.  Use Asphodel for pains 
in the legs or bladder.  Boil a little of the root in water and 
drink the resulting infusion. <see the infusion recipe if you are 
not sure how to make one>  A little of the root itself, carried in 
a clean white linen cloth, will protect against all negativity 
<evil influences>.  keep some wrapped up and hidden in the house 
for the same effect.  Teething children should carry a little 
Asphodel and their teeth will break through and grow painlessly.  
It also offers ver good nighttime protection against fears and 
enemies alike.

As with previous roots, store in a glass container away from the 
light and moisture.  Be sure to seal the lid after every use to 
insure freshness and potiency.

                       The Magick Pantry - Basil

This is the most controversial of all the herbs.  To many it is 
sweet and charming.  To others it is poison.  In all ancient 
writers Basil excites rude abuse.  A French physician of the Middle 
Ages has claimed that to inhale the herb causes a scorpion to be 
born in the brain, or as the modern doctor might say, madness.  Of 
course, opinion again vary.. although many myths have their basis 
of fact.  On the other hand, Basil is a popular and harmless 
cooking herb.  Include it fresh in the Magick Pantry.  Grow a new 
sprig in the garden and it will keep you safe.  The Hindus solemnly 
hold it to be a sacred herb and worship it.  So dear to them is the 
Basil that they place a sprig of it in each room of their house to 
bring safety and prosperity.  Hang it on the inside of the door of 
each room.  Sprinkle a pinch on food just before it is eaten and 
your soul will be joined to that of the goddess of love.  The 
married partner who has eaten Basil will be truly loved, but may 
also become quarrelsome.

As with other herbs, store in a proper container, sealed to prevent 
moisture loss/gain.  Basil can be dried from fresh cuttings by 
hanging upside down for a week or longer depending on the plant.  
Once dried, storage is relatively easy.

                    The Magick Pantry - Belladonna

The term deadly nightshade accurately describes the strength of 
this powerful Herb.  Sweno's army, when it invaded Scotland, was 
lulled into repose while its leaders were negotiating a truce which 
the Scots never intended to accept.  The Scottish side provided the 
drinks and refreshments by mutual agreement.  The drink given to 
Sweno's army was laced with Belladonna.  The wretched army fell 
into a deep slumber and, thus made vunerable, was overwhelmed by 
the Scots.  The name Belladonna derives from two sources.  The herb 
has its cosmetic uses and can make a lady twice as beautiful by 
enlarging her pupils into a seductive wide-eyed look.  But also it 
is named after a notorious Italian poisoner, Leucota, who viciously 
used the herb to poison all her beautiful female friends.

This herb can be difficult to aquire although storage isn't a 
problem.  Utilizing the same principles as in the previous posts 
should be sufficent.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 28966348
                       The Magick Pantry - Betony

this herb is also known as Bishopswort but in the Magick Pantry it 
may not be given an ecclesiastical name.  Call it Betony or Wood 
Betony and hold it in awe.  It has both a good and evil reputation. 
 The physician to the Emperor Caesar Augustus used it to treat his 
master for liver trouble, to protect him from Epidemics and to 
assist in his digestion.  <as you can see it's great for the 
digestive part of the quinary>  It was said that the Emperor used 
it to guard against Witchcraft although this term was mistaken in 
those days.

On the other hand, Betony is said to have been invaluable to 
sorcerers' spells.  It's forbidden name was bestowed upon it 
because it tended to grow around old abbeys and derelict churches.  
Many people said that the herb was hiding on consecrated ground 
from the may occultists who would use it for evil purposes.  

In opposing various forms of witchcraft, it may be used as follows:

Gently flake the dried leaves and strew them in an unbroken circle 
around the outside of the house or place you want to protect.  Make 
the ring thicker under windows and outside the door.  A wall of 
good enfluences will arise and no evil deed will be able to pass 
through it.  

Caution:  If Betony is consumed it is sure to cause death by 
vomiting.  Please do not use this herb in edible recipes!

Betony is a natural enemy of the vine, for their tendrils repel one 
another.  Keep them far apart in the Magick Pantry for this simple 
reason.  Like described in the Astral_Garden, there are those herbs 
and trees that simply will not tolerate each other.

As with the other herbs, store in sealed containers, away from 
excessive moisture and light.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 28966498
                     The Magick Pantry - Blood Root

Store this herb in a jar labelled with a false name but remember 
that the Blood Root is within.  This herb is the root of deception. 
 The Indians of North America used it to stain their bodies, and it 
is used still to dye fabrics.  Taken internally it can produce a 
hypnotic trance. (use with caution as with all magickally oriented 
herbs)  Carried on a person, inside a leather pouch or a 
money-purse, Blood Root will protect that individual from 
negativity or evil influences.  But keep it close to money for it 
demands payment.  If a home is suffering from an evil influence, 
put a sprig of Blood Root under the doorstep or windowsill and all 
will be well.  Any definite spell or curse placed by a witch can be 
reversed by flinging broken pieces of the root onto his/her 
doorstep.  However, never trust Blood root unquestioningly, as it 
often times will suprise you.

As with other herbs, store in a glass container or container of 
your choice.  keep it free of excess moisture, and always shield it 
from extra light.

                     The Magick Pantry - Brimstone

No substance is more powerful in invoking or in driving off the 
forces of evil.  Find a piece of red paper and lay this on a metal 
plate or dish.  On the paper place a pinch of Brimstone.  do this 
four times and put each dish in one of the four corners of the room 
in which the spell is being cast.  At midnight set light to the 
Brimstone.  Address each dish with the following words:

     * I command all evil to flee this house never to return *

Remember to leave all windosw wide open during this rite or the 
smoke of the brimstone will be unable to escape and with it the 
spell.

Some say that Brimstone is actually a resin like that of 
Frankinsence.  If you have additional information on this item, 
please feel free to post about it.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 28966bf9
                     The Magick Pantry - Celandine

Never confuse this important plant with the lesser Celandine or 
Pilewort used traditionally in the treatment of haemorrhoids.  The 
true Celandine is at once a more disagreeable and more potent herb. 
 It has black seeds; its taste is bitter and caustic; and its smell 
is foul.  But its influence is not to be sneered at.  Swallows and 
Eagles build their nests in May, and the flowering of the Celandine 
in that month is linked with this annual domestic impulse in the 
animal kingdom.  the herb has its human uses and it is a useful 
medicine for jaundice, corns, warts, sore eyes, toothache, ringworm 
and scurvy.  

John Parkinson, in a manual published in 1640, writes that he has 
it on good authority that any sufferer from yellow jaundice will 
benefit by putting a sprinkling of Celandine herb beneath his bare 
feet and treading it.  But its influence is wider still.  If the 
heart of a mole can be obtained, cooked with this herb and then 
consumed, it will vanquish all enemies and win any law suits that 
may be contested.  More somberly, when placed on the head of a 
dying man, the Celandine will disclose whether or not the sufferer 
is bound to lose his fight. If the man must die, he will sing out 
in a loud voice, but he will weep if he can be saved.  I thought 
that was interesting indeed.  Something that I simply must try when 
given the unfortunate opportunity.

As with all herbs, store them in a closed container away from 
external light sources, and keep them dry.

                       The Magick Pantry - Celery

Known traditionally as smallage, this plant has always been one of 
the prime aphrodisiac foods and more will be made of this kind of 
magick in the final set, probably located in the Astral_Home echo.  
The rumour is that the famous cola drinks contain elements of this 
particularly stimulating tonic.  

Gather the root when it is still green, drench it in the oil of the 
Cypress tree and place the greenery in a pot of gruel.  Leave the 
gruel for one year.  Worms will appear, and those who carry these 
worms with them will be gentle and kind and able to triumph over 
their enemies. <I know that sounds discusting, although it has been 
said to be quite powerfull>

To make Oxen etc, faithfull and certain to follow their masters, 
tie a pouch of the celery herb around their necks.  The length of 
time unfortunately was not specified.  Being that this is the 
Astral_Chef echo, that didn't sound too important anyway. <smile>

As with all herbs, you know.. so on and so on...

                     The Magick Pantry - Centaury

The Sun dominates this herb as it does many of the other Magick 
Plants.  A Centaury opens its flowers just as the sun comes out and 
closes them as the sun goes in.  Often the Centaury is described as 
an agreeable herb and is prescribed for Dyspepsia, but care is 
advised.  If this herb is mixed with the blood of a female lapwing 
or a black Plover and poured with oil into a lamp, all those who 
circle the light will believe themselves to be magickal and will 
live in a world of delusions, so it is stated.  Throw the same 
mixture into a fire when the stars are shining and then watch the 
heavens.  The stars will seem to clash and collide.  Put some of 
the herb and the birs's blood on a bandage and push it under a 
foe's nostril, it is said that he/she will suddenly be filled with 
groundless fears and run for his/her life.

I will try to find more about this herb.  If anyone has additional 
info, I'd really love to hear it..

                      The Magick Pantry - Chicory

Do not despise Chicory or Endive and exile it to some anaemic 
salad.  Endive was a divinely chosen herb among many cultures.  
Traditionally, it is a herb of love.  To prepare it and bring it to 
usefulness, chop the Chicory and let it dry.  Grind it to a powder 
and as a love philtre add it to your food or drink. (especially to 
flavour coffees)  It is said to do so without telling anyone and, 
if the secret is well kept, this philtre will arouse passion in the 
lover of one's choice.  For good fortune in romance an Endive must 
be carried on the person.  Be sure to renew it every two weeks with 
a fresh plant as its period of potency is not more than fifteen days.

Legend states that in ceratin ceremonies, if carried out with 
Chicory, can make the man who eats the plant invisible to human 
view.  Crusaders hung it on their banners, explorers carried it as 
they wen venturing into a new land, and prospectors looking for 
gold in California kept a sprig of it in hand for good luck.  

Gather Chickory at midnight on the 25th of July.  Force a sprig 
into any lock that will not open, and pass another sprig over 
parchment bearing a description of any problem to be solved; all 
obstacles and difficulties will be resolved according to legend 
about this herb.

As with any herb, keep snug in a seal container.  Label your 
container and be sure to keep direct sunlight away from this herb, 
as it tends to loose its potency when over exposed to excessive 
sunlight.

                      The Magick Pantry - Coriander

In many religions Coriander is honoured.  Several references have 
been documented that the Gods demanded that this herb should be 
used with four others at each feast.  Its other uses are not so 
godly however.  Grate the seeds into a glass of your best, matured 
wine.  Give them to a lover and strong passions will be arroused.  
But as the powder is placed in the wind, the lovers must chant 
together with the following couplet:

           "Warm seed, warm heart, Let us never be apart"

Nothing else must be said according to legend.  When the wine is 
drunk its influence will be felt sruging in the blood, so it is 
written.

The Coriander seed is round and has an appearance like that of a 
small nut.  Its shell is eaisly broken once dried, and has a very 
pleasent fragrance.

Store this herb in a glass container, free of moisture in your 
Magick Pantry. As with other herbs, keep them away from strong 
external light sources..

                        The Magick Pantry - Dill

Like with most herbs, the myths are endless for this one as well.  
It was said that many attributed this herb as a cure for the common 
hiccough.  Many even thought that the common hiccough was a result 
of a witch with a frog in the throat. <grin>  This amused me..

The power of the Dill shouldn't be taken lightly, as it should be 
greatly appreciated by any magician.  To cure the common hiccough, 
stir a small pinch of Dill into a syrup made from Black Cherries 
which have been laying in the Magick Pantry for at least (3) days.  
When the powder is well dissolved in the liquid/syrup, allow a few 
drops to trickle down the throat without swallowing.  The hiccoughs 
will cease.

Dill was also included in many love potions.  Here's an old recipe 
used here as an example.  Steep a few sprigs in hot sweet wine.  A 
few minutes after drinking on half of a pint, it is said that 
passions will be excited. (old but effective, I'd say)

Dill is also quite effective in removing negative energies 
throughout the household.  As with Basil, the same techniques are 
applied.

Keep this and all herbs in a sealed container in your pantry.  
Again, away from strong light and excessive moisture.

Make a light distillation of this herb and bathe the face with it.  
Do not use a mirror and trust the herb.  It is said that by 
utilizing this tincture on the face that it will profit the 
complexion by removing unwanted blemishes etc.  

Elecampane is of course also an effective love potion.  Aristotle 
himself taught how to make them, using this herb as follows.  Take 
Vervain and Mistletoe and place these herbs in a got oven with the 
Elecampane.  Dry and mingle the sprigs thoroughly.  Pound the three 
herbs into a powder and put this into the food or drink of the one 
desired.  The magickal combination of each herb bound together by 
this process is said to achieve a potency far beyond that of your 
basic aphrodisiac's strength.

I'm sure that everyone would be interested in hearing from those of 
you that have utilized this herb in other fashions as well.

                       The Magick Pantry - Eringo

This unique herb has many benefits, not to mention its tremendous 
powers in the healing plane.  It is a necessary part of any Magick 
Pantry, one that should never be left out.

To heal broken bones or simply to draw out thorns from lacerated 
flesh, make a paste of the herb by brusing the root and boiling it 
with pig fat (bacon, fatback etc. although salted lard works best)  
Apply the mixture as a poultice.  The bones will heal, the thorns 
will spring out and the skin will mend without a any trace of a 
scar.  

Again, this herb has many benefits.  Like most herbs it too can be 
used in Love Potions.  To improve a love affair or invigorate a 
marriage bed, grind the root into small pieces or into a powder.  
Add this to your food or better still, to that of the uninspired 
partner.  Legend says that the ancient Greek women always wore a 
sprig of Eringo to ensure that they kept the love of a man.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 2899ac0c
                      The Magick Pantry - Ginseng

With the exception of tea's, Ginseng is the most celebrated plant 
in all the Orient.  The Chinese have great faith in its curative 
and strengthening properties and call it the "Chinchona of China".  
The Manchurian Genseng comes from the Emperor's mother country, 
from the soil from which legend says sprang the `God of Heaven'.  
It is, therefore, gragrded as more efficacious than the Ginseng 
grown anywere else.  When the plant grows wild its root resembles 
the shape of the human body, and like Mandrake, it is thought to be 
most appropriate for most any Magickal spell.

Medicinally, Ginseng is a cure for colds, skin diseases and poor 
circulation of the blood.  It's anti-spasmodic properties relieve 
certain forms of hiccoughs too, like Dill.  But it is also a very 
powerful remedy for rheumatism.  When taken regularly it removes 
general fatague and promotes good health.  Combined with the juices 
of a ripe pineapple, it is an excellent medication for indigestion. 
 Ginseng is particularly useful in the treatment of young children 
as well as the aged.

Ginseng tea can be made from the dried leaves or blossoms of the 
herb.  After the berries are gathered select the brightest, 
cleanest leaves from a mature plant.  Place them above the kitchen 
stove in thick bunches turning and mixing well until they are very 
dry.  Store away in paper sacks.  When the leaves are steeped in 
boiling water, just like ordinary tea, the liquid may be drunk with 
cream and sugar if preferred.

Another recipe for general use in the home is the following:  Take 
a piece of the root when it is very hard and dry.  Break it up with 
a hammer and grind it through a coffee mill several times until it 
is reduced to a fine powder.  To three ounces of the powder add one 
ounce of milk, sugar and sixty drops of oil of wintergreen.  Mix 
all the ingredients well and store in a glass jar.  The correct 
dosage in one teaspoonful to a small teacup of boiling water.  When 
the drink is cooled it should be taken before each meal.  It may 
also be filtered served with cream and sugar, and consumed with the 
meal.  Made as directed this is a most pleasant aromatic tea and 
has a good effect on the stomach, brain and the nervous system.  If 
the evening cup of ginseng is much larger, it is a good and safe 
hypnotic, producing a deep restfull, natural sleep.

I would also like to point out that Ginseng does not always have to 
be considered as a medicinal herb, as that is simply not true.  It 
is a food, a plant that can be consumed as food.  Therefore one 
should consider Ginseng as a food rather than a medicinal remedy.  
Long before the Chinese used herbs medicinally, they realized the 
benefits of Ginseng as a food.  When the warring states began, they 
began to search out its benefits medicinally.  Now that we are once 
again a peace loving lot, we once again should realize these `food' 
related benefits as opposed to the medicinal ones.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 2899af91
                      The Magick Pantry - Henbane

Mystery has shrouded this herb for centuries.  Many legends both 
true and false as also accompanied it for this reason.  To begin 
with let's discuss the hard cold facts.. NEVER play with Henbane.  
It is as powerful as Opium and a deadly poison if taken unprepared. 
 NEVER let a child sleep near a Henbane as if he/she does, they 
will never wake.

Not suprisingly, it was a traditional means of putting down a mad 
dog in years gone by.  The dog was induced to eat meat mixed with 
this herb and the animal quickly died.  Curiously, too, if the 
juice of the henbane is poured into a silver cup, the cup will 
shatter into thousands of fragments.

For those who enjoy a dish of Hare in season but cannot endure the 
hunt, the following is recommended.  Mix Henbane with the blood of 
a young hare and hang the hare's skin, smeared with the potion, 
outside the kitchen door.  According to English legend, every Hare 
from the neighborhood will gather there and will not move until the 
skin is removed.  Truly a Magickal enchantment, if the legend holds 
true.

The benefits of Henbane to human life are more controversial.  It 
is said that if the feet are washed in Henbane a peacefull sleep 
ensues.  Sniffing the flowers can have the same effect.  Hundred of 
years ago, dentists would burn Henbane in a sizzling dish of 
charcoal surrounded by water, and the desperate patient would be 
prevailed upon to inhale the fumes.  The charlatan would then claim 
that he could see the wicked, achebearing worms make their escape 
from the painful tooth into the water around the coals.  The 
chronicler of this story notes that the dentist had usually 
arranged for an accomplice to drop tiny pieces of lute strings into 
the water, as the patient closed his eyes against the smoke.  When 
he looked again he would feel less pain, owing to the numbing 
effects of the Henbane, and he could actually see his toothache 
wriggling in the dish.

Truly an interesting herb that does warrent some serious 
considerations, both in the preperation and storage of the plant.  
Please do be careful when working with this herb.

                     The Magick Pantry - Houndstongue

If you are squeemish please pass this entry as it's quite detailed, 
although an interesting addition to the Magick Pantry.  The herb is 
however a part of the pantry.

Whether or not this herb does neutralize the bite of a mad dog 
cannot be stated authoritatively.  But it is recorded that when 
strewn under the feet of a barking dog Houndstongue will silence 
the nuisance.. hence the name.  

The full spell is a bit more complicated.

Capture  a frog (it must be a young female) remove its heart and 
reproductive organs and crush them into the powdered plant.  Put 
the paste in an open dish outside your door or wherever the 
annoying dogs choose to bark.  Soon all the dogs in the 
neighborhood will gather around the pot.  Take enough sprigs of the 
herb and push one under the front toe of each of the dogs 
assembled.  They will be dumb henceforward.

Please Note!!! <This is for information purposes ONLY, and NOT to 
be considered advise from the Astral_Chef Echo or CrystaLink.  
Should you attempt this, you do so under your own accord.>

A more infuriating yapping can be even more effectively silenced.  
Tie a small sachet of Houndstongue around the dog's neck, where it 
cannot be ripped by the creature's teeth.  The animal will turn 
round and round wildly and finally drop down in a state of 
paralysis, barely distinguishable from death.

These techniques are of course totally used at the magicians own 
personal descresion.

                    The Magick Pantry - Ivy (General)

Ivy should have been planted into the very stones of the house.  It 
is also a necessary part of the Magick Garden (see the 
Astral_Garden echo for details). When it has wrapped itself around 
the home, it is said that everyone within will be well guarded 
against negative influences and illness.  However, it is said that 
if the ivy withers and does not thrive around the outside walls, 
financial storms will follow.

Old legends tell us that wine merchants, and innkeepers, or anyone 
who is making wines or throwing a party, must have a pring of Ivy 
outside their door.  Bacchus owns this plant and he will bring 
special merriment to any house where it is honoured.  It is also 
said that in doing the above that there will be gaiety but no 
drunkenness. 

Another legends states that if a girl who wants to find herself a 
spouce, takes a sprig of Ivy, laying it gently on her breasts and 
repeats these words, will find her awaited mate.

"Ivy, ivy, I love thee,  In my bosom I put thee,  The first young 
man who speaks to me, My future husband he shall be.."

It is also said that the concentrated essense of Ivy dropped into 
the nostrils will cure the common cold.  

In many religions the Evergreen Ivy is a symbol of everlasting 
life.  To others, more pessimistic, the gentle Ivy is a poison.  
Which ever view you choose, the Ivy is definately an essential 
accompaniment to your Magick Pantry.

                      The Magick Pantry - Lettuce

This is a very powerful plant, homely as it is.  Lettuce seems to 
be woman's enemy, and is said to be a chief cause of infertility.  
Never let more than twelve lettuces grow in the garden and never 
keep more than one lettuce in the pantry or the house will lack 
children.  Legend sometimes says otherwise, although many still 
swear by this today.

For the Romans lettuce was a good counter to drunkenness and 
titillated the sexual appetite after a good dinner.  The earliest 
English sources use in severe cases of insomnia.  The Egyptian 
Pharahos prized the Lettuce and offered it in worship to the high 
gods.

It has been said that nutritionally, some forms of Lettuce are 
perhaps absent of nutrients.  It is also documented that Lettuce 
contains 70% vegetable fats and water, which unlike popular 
thought, is not the best choice of dieters using this philosophy.

                       The Magick Pantry - Lilly

This is the flower of the moon and its best known action is to cool 
and pacify.  Medically, its strength lies in settling fevers and 
particularly in soothing madness.  Freckles and sunburn respond to 
the gentle application of the distilled water of the Lilly.  In 
some phases of the Magickal world the power of the Lily is somewhat 
different however.  Some say it produces madness, as does the moon 
herself, although these cases are few and far between.

Again, the following may not be pleasent for some.  If you tend to 
be squeemish, I'd simply go to the next entry. <smile>

Gather the flowers when the sun is in the sign of Leo.  Mix the 
dried flowers with the juice of the Laurel or of the Bay tree and 
leave the paste under a pile of cow dung.  Worms will breed.  Catch 
the worms, dry them and make up a powder.  Secretly sprinkle this 
powder on the chosen victim's clothes or even try to drop some down 
his neck.  So long as this powder sticks to him, never again will 
the enemy rest or sleep.  The oil drawn from the origional dung 
will cause an instant fever, if you can succeed in anointing the 
victim's brow with it.  However, if the enemy is just to be given a 
severe warning, drop some of the oil into his milk churns and 
endeavour to cover these with the skin of a cow of a single colour. 
 His cows will dry up till the spell is undone.

As you can see from the above, many cultures have abused the 
essences of the Lily, which in itself is a shame.  The herb/plant 
is a beautiful creation with many benefits to mankind.  Why someone 
would want to harm another using this addition to the Magick Pantry 
does not seem to be logical.

If you have a recipe from the Lily and would like to share it/them 
with us, I would certainly welcome them. <smile>

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 289a9562
                      The Magick Pantry - Mandrake

The root of Mandragora crudely suggests the appearance of a man.  
It hardly needs saying that this plant is probably the most famous 
in magick lore.  Superstition decrees that Mandrake must not be 
plucked from the ground by human hand or else the plant will kill.  
Instead, a cord was wound round the plant and then tethered to the 
collar of a manageable dog.  When the dog was chased, the root was 
pulled up and a hideous cry was heard to come from the plant.  
Again, according to superstition, the dog did not survive the ordeal.

Many superstitions of this nature shroud this mysterious herb.  The 
great sorcer Merlin knew of ways to call upon the Mandrake's 
powers, as well as the proper method of harvesting the herb.  
Legend has it that it was from the Mandrake that Morgan Lefae' was 
bewitched into Merlin's dominion.  Some say that they still are 
incased together for eternity below Stonehenge as a result of the 
Mandrake's influence.

It is said that a little of the juice makes a man vain.  More makes 
him an imbecile.  Mandrake is dedicated to Circe, the goddess of 
fecundity, celebrated for her golden hair and notorious for her 
knowledge and application of Witchcraft.  Circe's Island, the basis 
of many legends is said to hold the true key to the Mandrake and 
it's uses.  Although no man has ever returned from the island sane, 
according to legend.

To keep this herb in the house sufficiently guarantees against 
sickness and peril.  When it was impossible to find a single 
uncloven root, again legend says that some of the ancient ones 
formed peices of Mandrake into human figures.  These also held 
tremendous magickal powers.  A man would order a female form and a 
woman would order a male form.  Each believed that the affection of 
the opposite sex could be secured thereby.  Many people burried 
their entire wealth by the Mandrake plant in the belief that the 
pot of gold would increase.

Moreover, the powder is an indispensable aphrodisiac.  Even the 
sceptical Pliny has no doubt about this.  In parts of Asia the root 
was worn to increase vertility and provide protection against 
attacks on the person.  Most magicians value the potiency of the 
Mandrake, and heed the cautions thereby.  Many spells will be 
useless unless the herb is burned as an incense while an 
incantation is being chanted.  Never forget that the Mandrake is 
supposed to be a living creature, engendered underground from a 
dean man's seed dropped on the earth as he was hanged for murder.

Interesting as the Mandrake is, the magickal uses are still 
somewhat puzzling to most in the craft.  I would be interested in 
hearing from those of you that have also used this herb in your 
magickal ceremonies.

                      The Magick Pantry - Marigold

Taken as a mouthwash, this is an ancient remedy for a toothache.  
The marigold is a well known stimulant too.  For hundreds of years, 
particularly in Holland, it has been the favourite flavouring for 
stews and potions.  As it is the flower of the sun and a summer 
flowering plant, it must be kept in a dried state.  The ancients 
believed that the Marigold's power to turn with the sun was a 
highly magickal property.  Rightly used it would ensure perfect 
peace and prosperity to the bearer.  But the following spell must 
be worked with the Marigold before it can succeed.

Always gather this flower in August when the sun is in Leo.  Wrap 
the head from one of the flowers in a Laurel leaf or in the leaves 
of the May tree or Hawthorn.  Add a wolf's tooth.  No one will say 
a bad word against the wearer of this charm.  Let him sleep with 
this small parcel under the pillow and if any man secretly wrongs 
him the enemy's identity will be made known.  If a marigold is left 
in your circle, or church, it is said that no woman that has 
commited adultery against a wronged and faithful husband will be 
able to leave the spot where they stand or sit.  If any spell 
demands that the marigold is eaten, make sure that this is done at 
breakfast time ONLY!

                      The Magick Pantry - Mistletoe

Legend and superstition place this plant on the higest plane of 
magickal power and influence.  Most of us involved in magick, have 
heard stories of the Mistletoe, or have utilized it in one fashion 
or another.  It is said that to hang Mistletoe round the neck would 
ward off negative influences.  Its habit of growing on trees, and 
particularly the mighty Oak has been attributed to the plant's 
anxiety never to touch the ground.  It's a benefical exchange as 
the Mistletoe actually protects the Oak from the dangers of 
lightning.  

The Anglo-Saxons worshipped Mistletoe as a present form of heaven 
and as the sprem of the holy Oak tree.  It has been written that 
only the Druid, robed in white and carrying his golden sickle, 
could gather it, and then but once a year during a ceremony 
dignified by the sacrifice of two white bulls.  At this ritual 
sacred songs were sung in honour of the plant and prayers to the 
gods were addressed to it.  Every New Year the Mistletoe was 
distributed to each family and used throughout the following twelve 
months as a remedy against all ills and as an antidote to all 
poisons.  

More specific among its uses is its power to open all locks.  How 
to perform this ritual is unfortunately not recorded in any text 
that I could find.  If you know or have read it somewhere, I'd 
certainly appreciate the post.

It has also been said to test whether a man's prophecy is valid, 
lay a pinch of Mistletoe mixed with rosinweed on his tongue.  If 
the prophecy is true the man will repeat his statement.  Otherwise 
he will forget it.  It is also a well-authenticated phenomenon that 
if the mixture just described is rubbed into a swallow's wing and 
the wing is the left hanging from a tree, the birds from miles 
around will spped to the spot and hover there indefinitely.

Exactly why anyone would want to do the above with the swallow is 
not recorded.

Store Mistletoe in your Magick Pantry in a sealed container, again 
away from  non essential light.  Keep the lid to the jar tightly 
sealed.

Balance and Light...

                       The Magick Pantry - Mugwort

This is definitely a female herb and its medical uses are generally 
in the interest of women.  With ordinary field daisies, it may be 
used to smooth away all hard cysts and bumps that grow in the neck. 
 In medieval witchcraft and in some modern traditions, Mugwort 
could bestow gifts of Clairvoyance if respectfully used.  One of 
its names is Witch Herb.  

Crystal Gazers/Scryers valued the plant and would strew their 
tables and tabernacles with sprigs of dried Mugwort.  The plant's 
tendency to lean to the north as it grows made many people believe 
that it was magnetic and responsive to many supernatural messages.  

To dream about the future, take three leaves of Mugwort and tuck 
them inside a hemp bag.  Put the bag under the pillow at night.  
After three nights have passed it is said that one will dream of 
the days to come.

When a magician had to be consulted, they frequently took a long 
time to complete the spell.  To prevent fatigue, they would often 
give their clients a sprig of Mugwort as they journeyed homeward.

Store this as you would the other items in your Magick Pantry.  
Again, paying close attention to excess moisture and light.

Balance and Light...

Hey, this sounds keen!  A couple things--
       1)  Back up a bit, and go over that bit about the 
Hemlock/slave onnection.  You may not have much use for that info, 
but, potentially, I do!  What kind of dynamics are involved here? 
Who actually eats it, what part, how much (obviously, dosage is NOT 
something to experiment with here!), with or without their 
knowledge (hopefully "with"), under what conditions does this work 
best, does the effect carry from this life to the next (i.e. is 
this a bonding that extends beyond death?), and most importantly, 
what makes it work (i.e. why wouldn't munching on a parsley sprig, 
for example, work just as well?  Why is it eaten, not just rubbed 
on the body, or burned & inhaled/incensed/whatever?  What's the 
significance of it all?  I'm assuming that it's partially something 
in the Hemlock itself, but I'm fairly sure that there's something 
beyond just that... how does Will figure into the scheme?)
       2)  You mentioned "recipies" for Dragon's Blood, Unicorn 
Milk & Camel Oil.  I've seen Dragon's Blood in resinous chunks 
(_Calamus Draco_) in a few herb shops, and have seen Unicorn Milk 
mentioned in a book or 2, but never followed up on it--is it 
similar to Unicorn Root (_Aletris Farinosa_, or _Chamaelirium 
Luteum_, for "False Unicorn Root")?  Anyway, I do have a reference 
from _Wylundt's Book of Incense" under Dragon's Blood which states 
that
      "Many unscrupulous dealers will sell you 'Poor Man's 
       Dragon's Blood'.  It looks and smells much like the 
       real thing, only it's made of talc, red sandalwood, and
       frankincense."
That's about as close to a "recipie" as I can find!
       Thanx for the posting--this promises to be quite keen!
       (However, I'm unclear as to whether this is a whole new echo 
that's coming up, or if it's an extension of this one? 
Clarification would be grand!)
       Much thanx--Tal

Yes, definately if you have them, by all means use them.  Some 
herbs, those with little to no chlorphyll <sp> ie: Hybiscus Flowers 
are fine in clear glass containers.  Actually, I have many of them 
in Sterilized Jars <old Ragu jars are perfect for this, after

Dragon's blood is the resin from the Draceana Draca, a palm tree 
which grows in temperate to tropical climates. It is a deep red 
color, and is harvested in much the same way as frankincense oil.

Thank you Lady Galadriel!  I've seen recipes for Unicorn Milk,

Oh I have no doubt of that.  If something is strong enough to smash

Astral_Chef was originally created to explore the art of poultices,

Personally, I prefer to hang the Basil for a time.  This allows the 
nectar to travel down through the stems to the leaves.  It also for 
some reason keeps the leaves (aroma) sweet smelling rather than 
creating a tartness which some Basil tends to do.

Storing the plant is easy once you've dried it.  The stalks make an 
interesting accompaniment for your homemade incenses, if ground.

It is my opinion that the colour of the glass isn't important, if

another story though.   Did your source give you any other details

                      The Magick Pantry - Musk Oil

Never feel that this is too exotic for the larder.  Many spells are 
made sweeter or more insidious by the lingering scent of musk.  To 
bless a Talisman of Venus and ensure good health, prosperity and 
love, Musk can be utilized in the following ways..

Bring the talisman for blessing on a friday; come at the tenth hour 
of the day or at the eighth hour of the morning.  Make a fire of 
Myrtle wood and throw Musk Oil and Lignum into the flames.  Place 
the talisman (used for defense, protection, or allurement) in front 
of the vessel that bears an offering to Venus, and as the incense 
rises chant the following invocation:

"Conjuro et confirmo Super vos angeli fortes, Sancti atque 
potentes, Sancti atque potentes."  <if someone would like to 
translate this, it appears to be Latin.  I would welcome the 
English translation>

After this invocation a special request is made and the Talisman 
will be blessed.  It is important not to touch the talisman until 
the next day.  Leave it to rest, or the spell will be undone.

As you can see, Musk Oil is traditionally used in incenses, bath 
oils, and elixers for love.  This recipe simply allows the maker to 
invoke the talisman with a purpose.

I would like to add here that in many traditions, the difference 
between a Talisman and an Amulet is that while the Talisman is used 
for protection, love ect.. the Amulet is usually agressive, and 
promotes agressive magickal properties.  Do not confuse the two, as 
the "Purpose" must be clearly stated prior to the invocation of any 
magickal tool. <for more information on tools, check in our new 
echo MAGICKAL_TOOLS.>

                       The Magick Pantry - Myrtle

Out of all of the primary ingredients, Myrtle is one of your best 
resources.  If one is ever afflicted by bad dreams sent by one's 
enemies, it has been written that Myrtle is the perfect remedy.  

Here's what you do:

Make a small glass of the liquid and keep it by the bedside.  It is 
said that any negative night spell at work will be cancelled.  The 
reason for this is unclear, however based on research and from 
personal experience, it is definately worth the effort.

Myrtle was a particular favourite of the goddess Venus.  Both the 
Greeks and the Romans believed that the plant contained the secrets 
of eternal youth and passionate love.  The theory was as follows:  
To gain these benefits for ever, a brew of Myrtle must be drunk 
once every three days since the spell lasts only that long without 
renewal.

The taste of the plant is undeniably disagreeable.  It is, 
therefore, permissible to mix Myrtle with food.  But mix it only 
with meat for when it is added to another substance it will taste 
of blood.  Remember for this charm to work both lovers must eat or 
drink from the same container, otherwise no good effect will be 
felt from the Myrtle.

It is said that for thinning hair, you can use Myrtle berries 
together with rosemary, southernwood, hazel-bark and maidenhair in 
equal amounts.  Burn them together in a fresh fire and collect the 
ashes carefully.  Stir this powder into white wine and use the 
liquid as a shampoo, rubbing and massaging into the scalp.  make 
this a daily ritual.  <please understand that this is not for those 
experiencing Male Pattern Baldness, as that is a totally different 
issue all together.  It is rather used for sudden hair loss cases 
etc.  I have to admit however, I've not tested this on myself, so 
who knows for sure, it may just work..<smile>>

Some old cultures believed that if Myrtle was eaten, it would 
empower anyone to spot those delving into evil magickal art forms.  
Be forewarned however, that most expert in these arts are also able 
to counter these actions.  It is not something to play with to say 
the least.

It is said that when a fresh Myrtle sprig is picked and crackles in 
the hand that the beloved person is always true and faithfull.

Many legends refer to this herb with affection calling it the 
bleeding tree, since it was connected with blood and sorrow in 
Greek mythology.  Phaedra pricked these leaves with a hairpin in 
her anxious frustration as she awaited Hypolytus, who was already 
dead.  The leaves still bear the sorrowful marks.  Therefore, when 
storing Myrtle leaves, never crush or bend them before they are 
dried or used.

                       The Magick Pantry - Nettle

Nettle is an agressive plant with many properties.  The Nettle in 
England was traditionally supposed to have been planted by the 
Roman legions of Julius Caesar.  Unused to England's miserable and 
freezing climate, they frequently found their limbs chilled or even 
numbed by the frost or sleet.  As a remedy they plucked the Nettles 
and then scorged their legs and arms with them.  After this they 
enjoyed the warmth of the inflammation.  Legend has it that to hold 
the Nettle in one's hand <how tightly was not mentioned> insures 
one against any fears of hallucinations.

Take some Nettle leaves and mix them with the common houseleek, 
which is a soothing agant against Nettle stings.  Anoint the body 
with this essence and sprinkle the rest on any stretch of water 
where fishing has been unseccessful.  Then enter the water treading 
with dignity and respect for the magick, and the fish will leap 
into your hands.  If they are unacceptable or too small, just 
withdraw the hand and the fish will happily jump back into the 
water of their own accord.

Growing tips and planting the Nettle are located in the 
Astral_Garden echo.

                       The Magick Pantry - Orris

This is an ordinary herb to all appearances but its two magickal 
uses must be known.  In the middle ages it was mixed with food and 
drink to promote love.  Ground into a fine dust and blown over the 
clothes of a loved one, it will ensure that the lover's affection 
is returned.  

Orris is a powerful incense in many magickal arts.  When making a 
benign incantation during the casting of a spell favourable to 
oneself, sweeten the breath with an Orris root.  Offer a sprig to a 
baby, if he takes it and puts it in his mouth, his teething will be 
easy and his whole life is said to be a happy one.  If he seems to 
be refusing it, encourage him, since to embrace the Orris is to 
learn to enjoy all that is moderate and pleasant in life.

                    The Magick Pantry - Pennyroyal

Any ordinary domestic larder will certainly contain this common 
flavouring even before a Magick Pantry is assembled.  But grow the 
plant in your Magick Garden (see the Astral_Garden echo).  A brew 
of the plant is useful as a remedy for spasms or hysteria.  The oil 
will deter mosquitos and gnats as well.  A garland of the flowers 
worn round the brows will relieve giddiness and a swimming head.  

By far the most mysterious powers of the herb possesses bear on the 
animal world.  Take some dried Pennyroyal, grind it with a stone 
taken from the nest of a lapwing or a black plover, and smear the 
belly of any female beast with this powder.  The animal will 
quickly produce an offspring that is deep black in colour.  An 
ailing animal can be miraculously healed of any sickness by 
sniffing a pinch of Pennyroyal mixture.  At first the poor beast 
will drop as if dead but presently it will rise again completely 
cured.  A little more of the mixture placed among bees will ensure 
that they never desert the hive.  Any bees or flies that have been 
drowned can be placed in the warm ashes of this herb and it is said 
that they will return to life within the hour.

As you can see, there are many legends on this marvelous herb.  I 
would be interested in hearing anyone elses experiences with it as 
well.

                    The Magick Pantry - Periwinkle

Beware of treating this herb as mearly decorative and removing it 
to a vase or a display.  Recently its strength was further 
revealed.  It was claimed by some medical opinion that the 
Periwinkle or Vince Rosea, was an effective cure for diabetes.  
More interesting to most of us is the power the plant has to 
reconcile man and wife and revive their passions.  

Note: This may not be appropriate if you are weak stomached. <grin>

To effect this atonement, beat the Periwinkle into a powder and mix 
it with earthworms and the herb named Houseleek.  Unfortunately, no 
further information was available as to the specific way this balm 
should be applied, except to say that it should be given with meat 
to the unhappy couple.  Furthermore, put this herb in the mouth of 
a young bull and the animal will run amok directly at your enemy.  

For those of you that like special effects at your circles, and 
enjoy outside fires within them, sprinkle some Periwinkle powder 
into the fire and the flames will turn bright blue.

                       The Magick Pantry - Peony

It is said that this herb cured the gods injured in the Trojan 
wars.  From time immemorial, the seeds have been dried and worn in 
ticht neckband by men and women as a sure protection against those 
that work in the black arts.  In Christian philosophy, it was 
Lucifer himself that was credited with the creation of the Peony, 
but its dedication has long since been transferred to the sun.  
Therefore, work spells with it only on the seventh day, and then 
only after sunrise.  

It contains a remarkable cure for a swimming head or for those 
sensations of unreality that may afflict on at any time.  Take the 
root and the seed of one and the same Peony flower.  Ensure that 
the weight of both is equal.  Pound them together into as much 
powder as will balance a nutmeg on the scales.  Now grind the 
netmeg, shake the powder and grind it again.  Mix together both the 
powders and sprinkle fine sugar into them.  Put a pinch under the 
toungue every morning for a month.  This will steady and calm any 
being.

In Ireland it is widely used and is helpful to women suffering 
after childbirth.

The Rose is beautiful both in appearance and in scent.  Yes, it is 
a flower but it's also considered to be a very powerfull herb.  The 
magickal effects of the Rose can be devastating.  Take a center 
from the whole flower or just one dried petal.  A mustard seed and 
a weasel's foot are also needed.  Hang all these together in a 
hempen bag on a branch of ANY tree;  that tree will never again 
bear fruit.

A dried Rose, entwined in a fisherman's net, will charm into it a 
full shoal of fish.  To create an optical illusion, if illusion it 
be, take some of the origional Rose and some mustard powder and mix 
it together with purest Olive oil and a little Brimstone <Sulphur>. 
 Sprinkle this potion over the roof and the outside walls of the 
chosen house.  When the sun shines this house will appear to be on 
fire.

                      The Magick Pantry - Rosemary

It is traditional it is said to wear Rosemary at weddings.  This 
was always done in ancient times and the herb was a much a symbol 
of marriage as was the colour white.  The power of Rosemary is to 
remind and to bind.  For many years occultists have appreciated 
Rosemary as a stong agent.  

One spell, enabling a virgin to see her future husband, had to be 
carried out on the eve of St. Mary Magdalene.  The herb was dipped 
into a mixture of wine vinegar and water in a glass dish, and the 
juice was then used to anoint the virgin's breasts.  She had to be 
accompanied by two of her closest friends under the age of 
twenty-one, who would then conduct her back to her bedroom after 
the ritual, all without speaking a word.  The virgin would then 
inevitably dream of her future husband.

An alternative to the anointing was for the three girls to take 
three sips of the liquid.  They then fastened a sprig of Rosemary 
to their bosoms and retired confidently to bed.  All three would 
that night dream of their future husbands and learn the secrets of 
their lives thereafter.

Rosemary can also be used to retain or gain power over a man.  To 
do this, aquire some water or wine already touched by the man 
himself.  Place the Rosemary in four boxes, set out at the four 
polls of the compass, (Northe, South, East, and West) which must be 
placed in the center of the room.  Pour a little water or wine into 
each of the boxes and say the following: (Again, a Latin 
translation would be nice)

   "Tibi impero ut quaedam viluero, et velim adimpleas et facias"

When two days have elapsed take out the Rosemary, swathe it in silk 
and bury it in the earth, no less than six inches deep.  Let it lie 
there for three days and then remove the bundle one hour after 
sunset.  Burn the herb, collect and powder the ashes.  When this 
powder is discreetly placed into the food or drink of the chosen 
man, he will return your love.

Rosemary is a long slender leaf tapered on the ends.  It smells 
sweet, and when crushed it is quite palatable.  It is also said 
that one can make a Rosemary infusion, to rid the household pet of 
fleas.

                         The Magick Pantry - Rue

Many cultures have adorned this herb for centuries.  It is said 
that Rue is helpful in rescinding unwanted magickal workings, and 
to reverse decisions.  It is the herb of repentance, the herb of 
grace.  Roman Catholics sprinkle the petals of Rue on the surface 
of their holy water.  During a symbolic ceremony to guard against 
disease, it is also strewn in some courts of law.  Its uses in 
removing negative entities are astounding.  This includes the art 
of excorsism, in some faiths.

Here was an instruction from a priest recorded in 1664 that I 
though was interesting regarding excorsism.  His origin was never 
mentioned...

To remove the influence of someone's Familiar

First they are to try the entity by dousing with prepaired holy 
water, or water blessed by the faith.  To this would include the 
addition of incense, sulphur, and rue which from thence, as we 
suppose can, came to be called herb of grace, along with St. John's 
wort which therefore they call the evil out, yet they may do good 
to the patient.

Other uses would be to make a tea and some incense from Rue.  Drink 
the tea and burn the incense simultaneously.  Although Rue is not 
an aphrodisiac, it has been known to attract a desireable lover, 
clear the mind, and enable one to solve many problems.

                         The Magick Pantry - Sage

Many traditions utilize this powerful herb in many ways.  Of these, 
smudging, incenses, as well as cooking are among the most popular.  
Again, this herb must be grown fresh. <see the Astral_Garden echo>  
Never use the remnants of your cooking supply for magickal 
workings.  Red Sage is an exotic plant in spite of its conventional 
uses.  The herb may be used for throat gargles and mouthwashes, but 
it also has many magickal properties.

This magickal working is not for those that are squimish.  (I found 
it interesting, and am in hopes that others will as well.)

Dry, purify and select the best pieces of the plant and put them in 
a small pile of cow dung on a glass dish.  If discretion and 
respect are used, soon a worm will issue forth or perhaps a bird 
with black tail feathers.  The blood of the creature that wriggles 
or hops out of the glass vessel is powerful and dangerous.  Place a 
drop of it on the brest of anyone to be disposed of.  The person 
will loose his/her wits and feel nothing for fifteen days or more.  
Once the magick creature is killed for its blood, burn the carcass 
and collect the ashes.  Scatter them on a fresh fire.  A 
magnificent rainbow will appear in the sky and a horrible 
thunderstorm will follow.  If a woman wishes to dominate her home 
she must grow plenty of sage in her garden.

As mentioned above.. this text is for reference purposes only.

In the U.S. it is illegal to kill wolves, last I heard. I would 
also add that often the labels used in spells are meant 
allegorically, not literally. Take the example of Dragon's Blood. 
Any thing which could be accomplished by using wolf parts can also 
be accomplished in another way, thereby not causing the demise of 
such a wonderful creature. Those which may be road killed are often 
not good for magicakal purposes, altho by all means save the hide 
if possible.

Socrates did not make a slave of death this way! This is dangerous 
information. Hemlock is very poisenous, and even in minute doses 
will cause massive discomfort physically. Even inhaling the smoke 
of burning hemlock can be very dangerous.

Yes, it did, but it comes under the influence of Pluto, and was 
used in that connection by the Eleusinian mystics. The fields of 
Elysium are located in the Underworld. Also in connection with this 
it is used in the consecration of the magickal wand, and assits in 
the crossing over of souls if planted near grave sites.

from some very archaic herbals - and not good ones at that.
 The Hindus
 > solemnly hold it to be a sacred herb and worship it.  So
Use it to invoke Krishna and Vishnu.

Basil is used as a tea for indegestion, fevers, colds, flu, kidney 
and bladder troubles, headaches, cramps, nausea, vomiting, 
constipation and to calm nervous conditions. It can also be an aid 
in starting delayed menses.
Dried basil placed in grains and flours repels weevils.
Magickally, Basil is associated with salamanders and dragons. It 
can be used to invoke their prescence for advice, inspiration, or 
protection. For this purpose it can be burned as incense, drunk as 
a tea, or sprinkled as a libation.
It can also be used to promote courage for facing Initiations, it 
provides strength for positive expansion. It protects one from 
spiritual fear. It was used by Solomen is the asperging of the 
Temple.

 >                      The Magick Pantry - Belladonna

Used to invoke Bellona and other goddesses of war. Ruling planet is 
Saturn. Has an affinity to Onyx and should be stored with the stone.
Belladonna is the source of both Atropine and Scopolomine, both 
very useful drugs in allopathic medicine. The alkaloids which are 
refined for use in these drugs are responsible for the herbs `evil' 
reputation. They produce hallucinations, rapid heart beat, flushing 
of the skin, dry-mouth, which can lead to coma and death if not 
counteracted.
The active ingredients are Tropeine alkoloids,flavone glycosides, 
coumarins, scopoline, scopoletine, tannin, acids, and phytosturol.
In case of accidental poisening you should induce vomiting and give 
charcoal tablets.
This plant can be purchased in most any herbal garden shop.
Belladonna is still used in some countries to dilate the pupils of 
the eyes for thourough examination. It continues to be used in 
prepartions sold by pharmaceutical companies, and prescribed by 
M.D.'s for nervous stomach in the form of Donnatol.
It's use should be restricted to trained Herbalists due to the 
great potential for over-dosage with possible fatal results.
It has also been used as a specific antidote for nerve gases and 
accidental poisening from pesticides used in aeriel spraying.
             Blessed Be
             Lady G.

Where did you get this???? It is completely untrue!!!! Wood betony 
is NOT poisenous. It is often used as a substitute for black tea, 
without the harmful caffiene and acids found in tea.
Wood betony can help prevent intoxication if worn or carried, as

This mineral is sulphur, with brimstone being the archaic term for 
it. From this many of the "sulpha" drugs are made. Sulpha is an 
antibiotic, which can cause nausea and vomiting in many people, it 
has a FOUL smell. It can indeed be used as a cleansing fumigatory 
in sick rooms, altho its debatable if the cure isn't worse than the 
problem.
As a powder it has been sprinkled into infected wounds, altho today 
it is more common to use it in tablet form. It is especially 
effective in urinary infections.

I am referring to Celadine the Greater, in the following post.
Celandine aids in escaping unwarranted imprisonment and entrapment 
when worn next to the skin and replaced every three days.(Probably 
cause it smells so bad no one wants to be near you). It cures 
depression and imparts good spirits.
It is used in Eastern Europe in tincture form for sluggish liver, 
neuralgia of the face, head or shoulders. It is also useful in 
relieveing wound pain. Considered an effective wart remover, 
howeve4r it may also cause ulcerations.
It is considered a narcotic due to the effect of the volatile oils 
which contain the alkoloids. Active ingred: chelidonine, 
chelerythrine, coptisinel, protropine, chelidonic acid, saponin, 
carotenoid pigments and enzymes.

If you leave any food for a year worms will appear.

Chew celery seeds to aid concentration.  Use in dream pillows to 
aid sleep. Burn with Orris root to increase psychic power. 
Stimulates the liver. Celery juice or tea taken several times daily 
helps relieve some forms of sciatica or neuralgia. Stimulates the 
kidneys. Also useful for flatulence when tinctured into brandy.

Named after Chiron the Centuar, the great hunter, and patron of 
herbalists.
Used in cold infusion for stomach problems, stimulates the liver 
and bile when taken prior to meals.
In no reference do I find any indication of toxic properties.
I am having some severe problems Greg, with the fact that there are 
often warnings attached to very benign herbs, and NONE attached to 
many of the very  dangerous ones you have listed here.

Chicory is use4d as a substitute for coffee, particularily among 
the French. It stimulates the liver. Used externally for skin 
inflammations, swelling and lacerations. Has a diuretic effect 
similar to dandelion. Chicory is also used as one of the Bach 
Flower remedies.
Active ingredients: Intybin, bitter principle, in root. Glycusides 
and cicharin in leaves.

Its name comes from the Saxon word meaning to lull. Used to relieve 
colic in babies. Relieves flatulence, and aids in releasing breast 
congealing. Stimulates appetite, has a laxative effect.
Protective when hung in doorway or carried in sachet. Often used in 
money spells.

I strongly urge you NOT to experiemnt with Hemlock in any way shape 
or form. It is extremely noxious, and the only slavery you will 
find from it is imprisonment for having killed a lover!
I am sorry if I sound severe, but this is very dangerous, and I am 
upset that Greg put this out without any cautions what so ever. 
PLEASE, please do not use hemlock. Even getting the volatile oil on 
your skin or inhaling it when burning can cause nasty reactions in 
some people.

No herb is stranger in its powers than Snakeweed.  It is also 
called Bistort and under this name it was used by doctors as a 
gargle and as a treatment for haemorrhages.  But regard it as 
Snakeweed and treat it accordingly.  

One legend says... Bury a sprig of it in the ground with a leaf of 
Clover.  Red and Green snakes will spring out from this patch of 
earth.  Catch and kill them and dry their skins.  Make a powder out 
of them and scoop a little of hte substance onto a burning lamp in 
a darkened room.  Again red and green snakes, wreathing and coiling 
in multitudes, will sprout from the light.  Place the same powder 
under the sleeping head of any man troubled by recurring dreams and 
he will never again dream of himself.

If you have anything further to add about Snakeweed, please feel 
free to do so.

                     The Magick Pantry - Spikenard

This plant is more common in North America rather than Europe, but 
international legend has much to say about its powers.  It is 
particularly well known in the German occult world.  But the herb 
originally grew in India and it has a deep history and significance 
among the Hindus. In the Christian faith for example, the Bible 
claims that Jesus Christ was anointed with ointment distilled from 
Spikenard.  

It is a most useful herb to keep a lover faithful.  Take a sprig of 
the herb and try to make the lover touch it with his right hand.  
Better still, make him/her wear it for a short time against his/her 
heart.  Retrieve the Spikenard and enclose it in a leather pouch.  
Tie the bag very securely and bury it in the ground.  The best 
place to do this is within the circle of stones in the Magick 
Garden.  As long as the bag remains in the earth, the lover will be 
true.  Check the bag twice a month, for on those occasions a new 
sprig of Spikenard must be added to continue the spell.

This root can be acquired under the name of skunk cabbage or meadow 
cabbage.  It has both the appearance and the reputation of being a 
nasty and anti-human herb.  Medically, its only use seems to be for 
producing saliva and helping to calm fevers.  But to the magician, 
its powers are more precise and more important.  

Take a Suntull leaf which must have been gathered on a Sunday in 
August, on hour after sunrise.  Fold a single yellow dandelion 
flower within the leaf.  Around this a bayleaf must be wrapped.  
Carry this talisman in your pocket to guard against those who wish 
to do you harm.  Every person henceforth will become a friend and 
justice will be obtained in any court of law.

                    The Magick Pantry - Tonka Beans

These beans are native to Guiana so some hardship may be 
experienced in acquiring them.  But their uses are various so it is 
worth wile to persevere. They are important in the making of 
incense on account of their strong and lasting smell.  To consume 
them is a perilous venture, since their power is to paralyse the 
heart.  However, when the bean is used with caution, its power is 
good.  

Take one or three of the beans and put them in a locket or pouch.  
To give the cham grace and greatly added power, attach a cross 
(made of wood, metal or other substances, just as long as it's not 
a crucifix) Aquarian Star, or a Pentagram/Pentacle to the chain on 
the locket.  To make a more powerful talisman <used for positive 
purposes> or an Amulet <used for destructive purposes> pierce the 
bean at the sharp end and thread it with a thin gold wire.  Onto 
this wire tie a golden cross, or any of the above suggestions.  Try 
to use a wishing stone or tool as this will bring about greater 
power.

Charge this amulet or talisman with a purpose, and release the 
energy into the universe.  It is said that by carrying this 
talisman, you will be protected against even the greatest harm.  
Likewise, if employing an amulet the same is true only in the 
agressive nature.

@MSGID: 1:133/520.1 28a81fcd
                       The Magick Pantry - Vervain

Many traditions utilize this powerful herb in many ways.  Here are 
some of the more interesting possiblities...

It is certainly a strong drug and widely used as a tranquilizer.  
Traditionally, a weak Vervain water creates merriment among the 
guests at a formal gathering.  An old custom was to steep Vervain 
in hot water, strain off the herb itself and diluting the solution 
further, to use the liquid as a detergent or a spray around the 
home.  It was said that all negativity would be kept at bay by its 
use.  The water was commonly referred to as Juno's brew.  The dry 
herb has often been carried as a charm against similar forces.

To cure fainting fits, gather the herb when the sun is in Aries.  
Mix the dried substance with a pinch of Peony or a single Peony pod 
which is one year old.  The brew will remedy the sickness.  If the 
herb is buried in a garden, after eight weeks worms will be 
engendered.  These worms are fatal to the touch.  A sprig of the 
plant, placed in a dovecot, will keep the doves happy and stop them 
from flying away.  If a man keeps two mistresses, a pinch of this 
powder will set the two women at each other's throat.

Vervain is not the best smelling herb out there, especially if you 
are going to steep it.  Be forwarned that it can have some major 
complications should a pet ingest too much of the herb, although I 
personally know of several people that give it to their animals 
regularly.  Cats are primairly of interest here as they tend to 
adore it, as a substitue for Catnip, so it is said.

It is said that Vervain is so powerful that if it were able to make 
contact with the sun that it would turn blue, if it were to ever be 
taken there.

                    The Magick Pantry - Whale Oil

This is an important ingredient in the Magick Pantry.  No this 
isn't the oil from the whale, although in old times, it was.  Today 
it is mostly Crocodile oil or the distillation of some organ from a 
reptile that is used.  Certain spells that you may come across will 
reference this type of oil.  These substances are getting harder 
and harder to purchase.  Hardly a single delicatessen still stock 
reptile produce.  

Here are some uses for Whale Oil..

To end the irritating croaking of frogs in the Magick Garden or to 
drive away howling cats (as we have all heard from time to time) 
you can cast the following spell:

Melt some wax that has been bleached by Sunlight and add a little 
Whale Oil from an earthenware jar.  Put the mixture into a clay 
vessel and lower into it a sturdy wick.  Light the magick lamp and 
put it on the edge of the pond or on a doorstep.  No frog will 
croak again and no cat will dare to howl at night, when this has 
been achieved.

                    The Magick Pantry - Wild Teasel

This is a mysterious and important herb to keep in the Magick 
Pantry.  It comes third in the magick order of plants, but it is 
rarely found in a garden.  It's power is unquestionable... the 
proof is found in tis capacity of produce pregancy in animals.  

The traditional spell demands Mandrake juice.  Mix this fertile 
essence with the prepared liquid of the Wild Teasel.  Give the 
mixture to a bird or a beast and it will presently produce healthy 
young of its own kind.  But do not give thanks to the Mandrake 
alone.  Fear the Teasel for it can create discord.  The secret of 
this reprehensible power is a dangerous one and must be carefully 
handled.

A tooth recently extracted from the gum is needed.  Drop the tooth 
into meat or drink prepared with Teasek, and quarrels and fights 
will begin.  Only the calming Valerian can soothe the tumult.

                      The Magick Pantry - Wormwood

Myths and legends surround this herb as well.  It was said that as 
the serpend writhered its way in flight from this Garden of Eden, 
this plant sprang up in its trail.  Its power is great, not only 
agains halitosis and worms, but also against mouse bites and 
attacks by jellyfish, Anomoes, and particularly the Portuqese 
Man-of-War's.

This herb dedicated to Artemis, it has long been employed in 
ceremonials to raise the dead, Necromancy.. if you will.  It has 
also been used to conspire with the lower negative entities of the 
underworld by many magicians.  In such rituals Wormwood must be 
burned on glowing charcoal and the incense will work the spell.  
Sometimes the powdered herb is placed in a folded cone of black 
paper and the paper is lighted at the tip.  But this must be 
performed only at the dead of night.  As the smoke rises, cry out, 
invoke the name or names of the desired departed, or entieies and 
ask them to make their presence known.  Provided that the necessary 
apparatus can be constructed, the spell will work better if the 
fuming incense is swung from side to sid on a pendulum.  

To cure the plaque magicians used to mix Wormwood with rue, plunged 
into a pint of ale with a slice of lemon and left overnight.  In 
the morning the brew was drunk in one draught without other food or 
drink.  The patient sually rallied.

by their powers".  (This probably isn't excessively accurate, but 
I'm pretty sure that's the general jist of it.)
       Do you mean that these incantations don't come with 
explanations?  I dunno, but for me, I'd be a little on the leery 
side of invoking/creating something with words I don't 
understand....maybe I've seen too many movies, but even still...!

Is this the same myrtle trees that grow pretty much only in 
Jerusalem-area and along the Oregon coast?  Keen!  I've kinda 
wondered what was so special about them that there would be such a 
market for all the little myrtlewood trinkets in gift shops along 
the coast...and maybe I can still find that myrtlewood cross that i 
got as a gift so long ago...?

Basicly light in general will leach nutrients  etc from any herb,

I might mention that putting mud on a nettle sting works very well 
for relieving pain of the sting.. and I have used the sap from a 
fresh maple leave for it also.. (I don't know if it was just 
coincidence with that or  not.. )
