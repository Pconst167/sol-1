This ritual, or piece thereof, was written in response to my need to do 
something about the situation in the Middle east.  Please feel free to 
modify it in any way you feel you need to, or adopt portions of it to your
general use.

Full Moon Ritual for the Middle East.

Calling the quarter:

I call to the guardian of the North, The spirit of the Stag who renews and
nourished.  That which strengthens the body.  I emplore you to come here and
witness this act of love.

I call to the guardian of the East, The spirit of the Eagle who mediates all
disputes.  That which strengthens the mind.  I emplore you to come here and
witness this act of love.

I call to the guardian of the South, the spirit of the Dragon who gives life
motion.  That which strengthens the will.  I emplore you to come here and
witness this act of love.

I call to the guardian of the West, The spirit of the Whale who ever changing
remains the same.  That which strengthens the intuition.  I emplore you to
come here and witness this act of love.

I call to the guardian of the Akasha, The spirits of the Goddess and of the
God.  That which brings enlightenment.  I emplore you to come here and
witness this act of love.

The circle is complete, let no discord enter.

Invocation for resolution

HIGH PRIESTESS
Bright lady of the moon
you who brings the blessings
of the night and the blessings of
peaceful solitude, we call upon you to
protect those who seek only peace.

(let the power slowly rise through this time)
(A Goddess chant should softly be started at this time)

Bright lady of the moon
you who brings the calm of
the night and the peace of the
dark, we call upon you to prevent
the long night of tyranny.

(the Goddess chant should be slowly building in intensity)

Bright lady of the moon
you who have worn the armor
of war, and give the caress of
peace, we call upon you to strengthen
the hearts and souls of our people.

(The Goddess chant should be built to a good intensity by now)

Bright lady of the moon
you who are the mother of
all, who gives breath to life
we call upon you to let none
steal your breath from our people.

By the four quarters....
by the Goddess...
by the God...

We release this energy to give sustenance to our desires....

The ritual then continues with the normal Full Moon rituals of your group and
ends of course with the grounding of the circle

I hope this helps...
