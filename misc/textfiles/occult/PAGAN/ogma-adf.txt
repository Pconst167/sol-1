                   AN INVOCATION OF OGMA
                       By Beth Bock
 
The following invocation of Ogma was used in the main ritual at last year's
Mean Earrach in New York. It opens a very nice portal to facilitate
communication with the Gods.
 
              Ogma! Bearer of knowledge.
              Ogma! Who brought the sacred script to our people.
              Ogma! Keeper of the gates between the worlds.
              Hear us!
              Open the gate to the other world
              That we may commune with our ancestors,
              The spirits of this place,
              And the Gods.
              Open the gate.
              Open the door.
              Open the way.
              So mote it be.
 
Closing the portal:
 
              Ogma!
              We thank you for giving us access to the other world,
              Our work is done.
              Close the gate that we may leave this place in peace.
              Blessed Be. (or alternatively 'So mote it be')
