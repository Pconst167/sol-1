             THE SCIENTIFIC SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF GOVERNMENT
                      (strictly private and confidential)

                               by Comte de Fenix
                              (Aleister Crowley)

                                   THEOREM.

  The scientific solution of the problem of Government is given in AL  (Liber
  Legis).  This Law supersedes all the empirical theories hitherto current.

                                  QUOTATION.

                                  Chapter 1.

            3. Every man and every woman is a star.
            10. Let my  servants be few  & secret: they  shall rule
               the many & the known.
            40. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
            41. The word of Sin is Restriction.
            42. thou hast no right but to do thy will.
            43. Do that, and no other shall say nay.
            44.  For  pure  will,  unassuaged of purpose, delivered
               from the lust of result, is every way perfect.
            57. Love is the law, love under will.

                                  Chapter 2.

            19. Is a God  to live in a  dog?   No!  but the highest
               are  of  us.  They  shall  rejoice,  our chosen: who
               sorroweth is not of us.
            20. Beauty and strength, leaping laughter and delicious
               languor, force and fire are of us.
            58. Yea! deem not of change:  ye shall be as ye are,  &
               not other.   Therefore the kings of the earth  shall
               be Kings for ever; the slaves shall serve.

                                  Chapter 3.

            4. Choose ye an island!
            5. Fortify it!
            6. Dung it about with enginery of war!
            7. I will give you a war-engine.
            8. With it ye shall  smite the peoples; and  none shall
               stand before you.
            58.  But  the  keen  and  the  proud, the royal and the
               lofty; ye are brothers!
            59. As brothers fight ye!
            60. There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.
              DEMONSTRATION.

    1. The average voter is a moron. He
       believes   what   he   reads  in
       newspapers,      feeds       his
       imagination   and   lulls    his
       repressions on  the cinema,  and
       hopes  to  break  away  from his
       slavery   by   football   pools,
       cross-word  prizes,  or spotting
       the winner of  the 3.30.   He is
       ignorant   as   no    illiterate
       peasant is  ignorant: he  has no
       power  of  independent  thought.
       He is the prey of panic.  But he
       has the vote.
    2. The men in power can only govern
       by  stampeding  him  into  wars,
       playing   on   his   fears   and
       prejudices  until  he acquiesces
       in    repressive     legislation
       against  his  obvious interests,
       playing on  his vanity  until he
       is  totally  blind  to  his  own
       misery   and   serfdom.      The
       alternative      method       is
       undisguised   dragooning.     In
       brief, we govern by a mixture of
       lying and bullying.
    3. This desperate resort to archaic
       weapons  is   the  heritage   of
       hypocrisy.    The  theories   of
       Divine    Right,    aristocratic
       superiority, the moral order  of
       Nature, are all to-day  exploded
       bluffs.  Even  those  of  us who
       believe     in      supernatural
       sanctions for our privileges  to
       browbeat and  rob the  people no
       longer delude ourselves with the
       thought that  our victims  share
       our superstitions
    4. Even dictators understand  this.
       Mussolini  has  tried  to induce
       the  ghost  of  Ancient  Rome to
       strut the stage in the image  of
       Julius   Caesar;   Hitler    has
       invented a  farrago of  nonsense
       about Nordics and Aryans; nobody
       even pretends to believe either,
       except  through  the   "Will-to-
       believe."   And the  pretence is
       visibly      breaking       down
       everywhere.  They cannot even be
       galvanized   with   spasms    of
       pseudo-activity,    as     still
       occasionally  happens  with  the
       dead toads of superstition.
    5. There  is   only  one   hope  of
       uniting    the    people   under
       intelligent leadership;  because
       there is only one thing in which
       everyone really believes.   That
       is, believes in such a way  that
       he  automatically  bases   every
       action of his daily life on  its
       principles.    (This  is true of
       practically  all  men,  whatever
       their  race,  caste,  or creed.)
       This universally accepted  basis
       of conduct is Science.
    6. Science   has   attained    this
       position  because  it  makes  no
       assertion   that   it   is   not
       prepared to  demonstrate to  all
       comers.   (This part is so  well
       understood that  all the  "false
       prophets"    -     Spiritualism,
       Christian Science,  ethnological
       cranks,  Great  Pyramid  puzzle-       mongers,  and  the  rest  of the
       humbugs - all pretend to  appeal
       to evidence,  not to  authority,
       as   did   the   Kings  and  the
       Churches.)     The  problem   of
       Government is therefore to  find
       a  scientific  formula  with  an
       ethical   implication.      This
       formula    must    be    rigidly
       applicable  to   all  sane   men
       soever without reference to  the
       individual qualities of any  one
       of them.
    7. The formula is given by the  Law
       of Thelema.  "Do what thou  wilt
       shall be the whole of the  Law."
       This  injunction,  in  one sense
       infinitely  elastic,  since   it
       does not specify any  particular
       goal  of  will  as desirable, is
       yet infinitely rigid, in that it
       binds  every  man  to follow out
       exactly the purpose for which he
       is    fitted    by     heredity,
       environment,   experience,   and
       self-development.    The formula
       is   thus   also    biologically
       indefeasible,    as    well   as
       adequate,  ethically  to   every
       individual,  and  politically to
       the State.
    8. Let this formula be accepted  by
       every government.  Experts  will
       immediately be appointed to work
       out,  when   need  arises,   the
       details  of  the  True  Will  of
       every individual, and even  that
       of every corporate body  whether
       social  or  commercial,  while a
       judiciary    will    arise    to
       determine the equity in the case
       of    apparently     conflicting
       claims.  (Such cases will become
       progressively   more   rare   as
       adjustment  is  attained.)   All
       appeal    to    precedent    and
       authority, the  deadwood of  the
       Tree of Life, will be abolished,
       and     strictly      scientific
       standards  will   be  the   sole
       measure by  which the  executive
       power  shall  order  the people.
       The absolute  rule of  the state
       shall  be  a  function  of   the
       absolute    liberty    of   each
       individual will.

      NOTICE OF O.T.O. DUES INCREASE

       Effective in September, all dues
    and fees  in O.T.O.  will increase.
    This  is  the  first  such increase
    since the early 1970s.  The purpose
    of this article  is to explain  the
    change  and  to  review   financial
    obligations   of   O.T.O.   members
    overall.
       In  1919,  dues  and  fees  were
    published in Equinox III(1).   When
    modern  figures  were  set  in  the
    early '70s,  they were  established
    as three times the 1919 value  (far
    below  the  inflation  rate,  no?).
    Now, approximately 15 years  later,
    dues are being reset at four  times
    the  1919  schedule  -  a one-third
    increase.
       O.T.O. members are charged  with
    the sacred obligation of supporting
    the Order to the fullest extent  of
    their financial means.  Annual dues
    are established by  the Order as  a
    minimum contribution.  Fees are set
    for  each  initiation  to defer the
    costs  of  the  initiation  itself.
    Additionally, the Lodge itself  may
    charge its own dues.
       The  annual  dues  are  sent, in
    their entirety, to Grand Lodge  for
    the general  operating fund  of the
    Order.  Fees remain with the  local
    bodies; but especially in the  case
    of Minervals and Io, these often do
    not meet actual expenses, let alone
    leave  anything  for  general local
    operations.
       To meet  the need  for at  least
    minimal  local  funding,   Baphomet
    Lodge and its satellites charge  an
    additional fee, equal to one year's
    Io  dues,  for  each initiation 0o-
    IIIo.    This  is  in lieu of Lodge
    dues.   The charge  is linked  to a
    distinct  service,  rather  than to
    the   more    abstract   idea    of
    "membership."    It  also  pays for
    your  subscription  to  the   Lodge
    newsletter.   The complete  revised
    schedule of dues and fees is listed
    here for  Man of  Earth initiations
    at   Baphomet    Lodge   and    its
    satellites:

            DUES  FEES  LODGE   TOTAL    0o      $20   $20   $20  = $60
    Io      $20   $20   $20* = $60
    IIo     $40   $20   $20  = $80
    IIIo    $60   $20   $20  = $100
    IVo     $80   $40        = $120
    C.P.I.  $20              = $20
    * Minerval & Io on same occasion
      = $100  (only one Lodge charge)

    For completion,  here are  the dues
    and fees for all other degrees:

            DUES  FEES         TOTAL
    K.E.W.  $20              = $20
    Vo      $104  $60        = $164
    K.R.E.  $40              = $40
    VIo     $124  $104       = $228
    G.I.C.  $144  $104       = $248
    P.R.S.  $156  $104       = $260
    VIIo    $224  $204       = $428
    VIIIo   $448  $408       = $856
    IXo     $672  $816       = $1,488

       Dues are  payable upon  taking a
    new initiation, or after one  year,
    whichever  comes  first.   Fees and
    Lodge  charges  are  payable   upon
    taking a new  initiation.  In  some
    cases, Lodge charges can be paid in
    labor or similar service.
       Members are also welcome to make
    whatever  additional  contributions
    they may  wish from  time to  time.
    All  funds  received  are   applied
    scrupulously to O.T.O. and Baphomet
    Lodge activities.  Any Lodge member
    is welco e to examine the financial
    records  of  the  Lodge on request,
    other than another member's private
    records.
       If  there  are  any   questions,
    please feel free to ask them.

     Love is the law, love under will.

             He Who Laughs...

      Do what thou wilt shall be the
             whole of the Law

       Much of what we do in life has a
    serious purpose.  Any task which we
    undertake, be  it for  spiritual or
    material attainment,  is a  serious
    and sober creation  of life in  one
    form or  another.   In this  we are
    gods; isn't being  a god a  serious
    undertaking  in  itself?    What  a
    sober  responsibility,  but  what a
    joyful experience!
       With  joy  comes  laughter,  our
    true outlet  for that  which cannot
    be  expressed  in  words.    Humans
    laugh;  those  that  can't or won't
    fall  into   a  very   sorry  state
    indeed.
       Why do we  laugh?  Laughter,  in
    the  form  of  a  "nervous giggle",
    occurs   when   we   are  tense  or
    anxious; it comes often at  someone
    else's   misfortune;   it   is  the
    response to jokes, usually told  at
    some other's expense.  We laugh  at
    anger,   at   danger,   at    fear.
    Laughter     relieves     otherwise
    unexpressible f elings: relief that
    the self is not the victim, loss of
    self-control, a sense of not  being
    in   control   of   ones  immediate
    destiny.    Seldom,  though,  do we
    laugh at ourselves.
       The utter inanity of a situation
    is   largely   that   which  is  in
    ourselves inane and ridiculous.  To
    laugh  at  that  part  of the inner
    self  is  to  see  all the joy that
    cannot be  so easily  expressed and
    to  conquer  that  which  is  self-
    righteous   and   self-destructive.
    Children do  this innately;  adults
    have "unlearned" this ability.
       Life is too serious to be  taken
    seriously.  Laughter, like a child,
    needs no excuse.  Laugh at the pure
    joy of being, at nothing at all, at
    yourself.
       "I tell you solemnly, anyone who
    does not welcome the kingdom of God
    like  a  little  child  will  never
    enter  it."     Regain   a  child's
    ability to  laugh; enter  into your    kingdom.

     Love is the law, love under will

            FROM THE XAO PALACE

              By Soror Sophia

       Turning  the  page  on our Thoth
    Tarot Calendar, there was the  card
    of the month:  Two of Cups  - Love.
    It  is  June,  and  that  certainly
    flavors things a bit.  It's a  time
    of emphasis on relationships,  deep
    loves, and passions; whether it  be
    spiritual or material.
       A person wonders: Is this person
    the right one?  Am I in love?   Are
    our  charts  too  similar,  or  too
    divergent?   This partner  can't be
    the  only  choice  to  make  on the
    planet.   Once decided,  and willed
    that  the  relationship  is the one
    that is desired, the person is in a
    new ball park.  One might apologize
    and   be   willing   to  accept  an
    apology, letting go totally  things
    that in a prior relationship  would
    have been held there for some time.
       The difference may be, that once
    one  has   the  stable   underlying
    certainty of  the rightness  of the
    action it can be carried out.  This
    is     not     just      concerning
    "relationships."  For "as above, so
    below,   and    within."       This
    relationship, as an analogy, can be
    a symbol for our overall  spiritual
    quest or  desire for  marriage with
    the infinite.  I feel that one must
    muster     the     same      drive,
    perseverance,    dedication,    and
    endurance  to  succeed,   whichever
    course  we   take.     The  lessons
    learned  are  carried  over to each
    plane of existence.
       When  one  signs  up  for   this
    "Course,"  let  it  be  known   and
    understood that there is work to be
    accomplished.    That  you  will be
    working  with  your  lab partner on
    certain experiments.   You  will be
    given  certain  tests  and   should
    expect them at anytime  whatsoever.
    You   cannot   audit   the  course,
    participation is  necessary.   Your
    lab  partner   is  yours   for  the
    duration  of  the  course.     Your
    determine the length of the course,
    the grades, what goes on at recess,    and the class size.
       But what shall be the sign  that
    one  has  made  a  right  decision?
    (sounding familiar here?)  Well the
    UnderXao   answers,   bending   her
    working   hands   down   over   the
    keyboard,  her  fingers  arched for
    typing,   her   lovely   feet   not
    stepping on  XaoBird, the  parakeet
    loose on the floor:
       "Thou  knowest!    And  the sign
    shall    be    my    ecstasy,   the
    consciousness of the continuity  of
    existence, the  omnipresence of  my
    body."
       As a friend of mine found as  he
    stepped  off  a  plane  in  Hawaii,
    feeling the warm air engulf him, he
    knew  he  made  the right decision.
    We too know and can feel it.
       This issue is one of  expansion,
    and nurturing.  We are building and
    creating, and  I am  having a  fine
    ole time at it.

                Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law

     Well, that's it.   We're all doomed.   1984 has become a  reality.  Soon
  we'll  have  no  personal  freedom.    Christian  prayer  in  the  schools.
  McCarthyism!  Plagues  of toads and  spiders!  Anita  Bryant for President,
  goats with two heads, Pat Boone  albums...arghhh!  Oh, hell.  It's  summer,
  and it's too damn hot for diatribes.   You guys only use this page  to line
  bird cages anyway. I'm going to the beach.  See you this fall.

                                            it'll be wrong.
  2. I disagree, but "As brothers fight  2. I'm  planning your "greater

  6. It's a blind.                       6. No one knows.
  7. It's revealed wisdom.               7. He made it up.
  8. Their rituals are too "Old Aeon."   8. There's   not   enough   sex  and
                                            violence.

                                            will die.

            ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND
              STUNS SKEPTICS

        by Edwin L. Andrews, Ph.D.
     (reprinted with permission from
         Archae-O-logical Annual)

       The tablet here presented is the
    oldest solid  evidence of  computer
    technology by early  civilizations.
    Written  in  Hebrew  characters, it
    is,  apparently,  the  mapping   of
    eight pairs of 8- bit registers, or
    possibly even  eight single  16-bit
    registers, from an ET 8032 computer
    chip.    It  will  be  noticed,  on
    inspection, that nine of the  bytes
    are  marked  with  a  |  character.
    These   divide   the    hexadecimal
    architecture    into    a   decimal
    infrastructure.
       The nine bytes designated by the
    |  character  contain  the   Hebrew
    correlates of  I, L,  and A  in the
    right bank, and  V, Ch, P  (final),
    B, and  R in  the left  bank.  This
    enumerates, by  the usual  methods,
    to 337, the value of a Hebrew  word
    meaning    "Ruler    of     Earth."
    Obviously,  this  alludes  to  some
    scheme  to  conquer  the  planet at
    large.
       Accompanying papyri declare that
    someone named  He-Shem (HShM,  "The
    Name")  brought  them  from  a land
    called Y'nis  (INIS).   He-Shem may
    in fact have been He-Shom.
       The vertical  lines of  the left
    register give an amazing key to the
    ancient chant of the Sudan:

       Dammel thinshed
       Kathachowdom
       Lo, the tizzle-tock
       The Darpadoth
       B.B. ve-Thaloa
          [The "B.B." has always
           been mysterious.]
       Shekkanah-brawl
       He-Vilthinbar
       Mish Becky Egg Heqq

       Also, the total numeric value of
    both   tablets   is   10,097.  This
    remarkably  matches  precisely  the
    number  of  Frigginites  exiled  in    Libya.  Furthermore, the tablet  is
    divided   exactly   as   were   the
    Frigginites  by  gender;  id   est,
    4,258  men  (matching  the value of
    the right tablet), and 5,839  women
    (the left tablet).
       Besides these few small  points,
    the     right     side      remains
    unintelligible  and  is   published
    here  with  the  earnest  hope that
    other scholars may assist in  their
    decipherment.

         "The Book of the In-Laws"

    1. New and improved!  The filet  of
       Haddock.
    2. Oh  come,  all  ye faithful, and
       Jim shall spill all the  secrets
       which  have  not  been  revealed
       already.  I, Christopher  Robin,
       am  the  complement  of Pooh, my
       bear. He is hungry, and he lives
       under the name of Sanders.
    3. I  am   always  the   center  of
       attention, which makes my wife a
       bit edgy.
    4. Yet it is  she who gets  invited
       to the best parties.
    5. Yuck!    These  old  rituals are
       filthy!  Let the nasty ones  get
       lost;   let   the   good    take
       laxatives.  Then we'll talk.
    6. I am heartburn and sunstroke.  I
       am  Life,  and  I  gave  at  the
       office,  yet  I  am  expert   in
       Grateful Dead trivia.
    7. I am The Omen and The  Exorcist.
       I am the fly in the ointment and
       the lime in the coconut.   "Come
       unto me" is a foolish word,  for
       I do not make house calls.
    8. Who  worshipped  Har-Po-Marx has
       worshipped  me;  badly,  for   I
       prefer Chico.
    9. Remember that  existence is  one
       long party; that hangovers  pass
       and are  done, but  liver damage
       remains.
    10. O boy, I can see you had enough
       of this yesterday.
    11. I see you hate the hand and the
       pen, but  I could  not afford  a
       word processor.
    12. Because we are both broke.
    13.  for  why?  Because thou failed
       grammar, and me.
    14.  Also,  we  couldn't  pay   the
       electric bill.
    15.  For  I  am  just  the greatest
       thing, and my number is nine one
       one to the  fools, but with  the
       "in" crowd I  am eight, and  one
       eight, and four out of five, and
       two for  one.   Which is  really
       critical, only I forgot why.   I
       didn't  draw  to  my   Jack-high
       straight.
    16. I am a priest in drag.  Oh, and
       I can count to eleven, just like
       my wife.
    17. Hear me, ye people of sighing
       Whose next  three paychecks  are
       all spent;
       Now is the time to start  crying
       --
       The Landlord just increased your
       rent!
    18. They are better off dead, these
       worthless  bums.     they   will
       hardly feel a  thing.  We  don't
       care  --  we're  on  the winning
       team.
    19.  Is  God  to  walk a dog? Woof!
       But Pig enumerates to 93.
    20.  Beauty  and  fashion,   Malibu
       condos and  fast cars,  coke and       cognac are of us.
    21. We have  nothing with the  scum
       and  the  rabble.    Refuse them
       spare change!  Kick them in  the
       ribs!    Spit  on  them!   Gouge
       their eyes out!  Drop napalm  on
       their  foul,  stinking   streets
       full of  cheap wine  bottles and
       shopping carts and -- excuse me,
       I got carried away.  If the body
       of the King dissolve, the Palace
       probably  needs   a  new   water
       softener.  Nuts!  Haddocks!  Pa-
       Ra-Keets!    UV  lamps, steroids
       and   contact   lenses,    track
       lighting!   I ask  you, is  this
       any way to run a pantheon?  Then
       again, what can you expect  from
       a bunch of nocturnal snakes?
    22. I am the Worm that lieth in the
       bottom  of  the  tequila  bottle
       which     fills     men     with
       drunkenness.   For a  good time,
       buy   strange   drugs   from  my
       distributor and trip  thereupon.
       The brain damage will barely  be
       noticeable.  Just say "Nu!"  The
       exposure  of  innocence  is fun.
       Be a manly,  lusty Man; you  can
       explain it all to God later.
    23. I am alone.   There is no  God.
       Where am I?
    24. But  ye, o  my people,  rise up
       and -- Shut  up, o deacon;  I am
       not there yet.  This is just one
       of many  Grave Mysteries  I plan
       to  hint   about  without   ever
       actually  telling  you anything.
       For example, it  is said, or  so
       some say,  that there  are those
       of  my  people  who are hermits.
       Now,  think  not  to  find  them
       milking goats in the West County
       of Ireland, or even standing  in
       wheatfields    holding    cubist
       lanterns  along  the  Tiphareth-
       Chesed Freeway, but at  cocktail
       parties, and in the Tokyo subway
       system.    How  is  it, you ask,
       that  such  people  are   deemed
       Hermits? Chalk up another  Grave
       Mystery.    Remember:  Kill  the
       wretched,  and  the  weak,   the
       struggling masses yearning to be
       free!    Burn  their homes, plow
       their fields with salt,  enslave
       them, oppress them -- oh my, I'm
       sorry,  I  seem  to  have gotten
       carried  away  again.   I really
       will  try  to  keep  a lid on it
       from now on.  Promise.
    25. It's us against them, boy,  and
       I say we call in the nukes!  The
       hell with what I just  promised!
       I  hate  them!    I  hate  them!
       Aaaargh!
    26.  I  am  the  train  entering  a
       tunnel, and the hot dog  chasing
       a donut.  If I lift up my  head,
       and  shoot  forth  venom, I will
       have to wash  the sheets in  the
       morning.
    27. There is danger in this  verse,
       for whoso  does not  give it  to
       his  editor  shall  make a great
       mess.  He shall stumble into the
       pit  called  Writers  Block, and
       there he  shall reason  with the
       Xaos.
    28.  Now,  damn  Because,  and  the
       horse he rode in on!
    29. Just who the Hell does  Because
       think he is, anyway?
    30. If  Will stops  and cries  Why,
       fire him.
    31.  If  Power  asks  Why,  tell it
       whatever it wants to hear.
    32.  Reason  won't  work either, at
       least not for you.
    33.  Enough  Because,  already!   I
       don't even like his dog!
    34. (What has he got against  dogs,
       anyway?  Is  it  my  turn,  now?
       Okay...*ahem*)  But  ye,  o   my
       people,  rise  up  and   restore
       circulation to your arms!
    35.  Let  the  rituals be performed
       with latex and farm animals!
    36. There  are parties  every other       Tuesday at Bagh-i-muattar Camp.
    37. A feast for the first night  of
       Pernod over ice!
    38. A feast for each of the ninety-
       four days of the writing on  the
       Book of the In-Laws.
    39. A  feast for  Alexia, child  of
       1.75 Masters  -- Ptah-Sekhet,  O
       profit!
    40.   Practices   for    initiation
       rituals, and  practices for  the
       Equinox so we  can piss off  the
       A... A... types again.
    41.  A  feast  after  class,  and a
       feast  on  payday;  a  feast for
       life,  and  a  sudden  loss   of
       appetite following death.
    42. A  feast every  day with  me so
       you can get heartburn.
    43.  A  feast  every  night with my
       wife so you can get spacey.
    44. Yeah!   Party  hardy, bro,  and
       fear not hangovers at all.
    45. There  is death  for the  dogs,
       but  only  if  a Czechoslovakian
       restaurant    opens    in   your
       neighborhood.
    46.  Doest  thou  fall?    Art thou
       hurt?      Call   Work    Injury
       Resources at (213) 466-1058.
    47. Where am I?  What are these?
    48. Pity not  the fallen!   (What a
       great idea for a song  title...)
       they are not my problem!  I hate
       them,  hate  them,  hate   them!
       Torture them, destroy them, burn
       them,!   Rip their  throats open
       with dull knives, and -- whoops,
       there I go again.
    49.  I  am  Haddock,  hear me roar,
       while I kill and maim the  poor;
       they knew that I would get  them
       in the end.  (This is one of the
       nine to  five; after  work there
       is  happy  hour,  wherein  I  am
       three sheets to the wind.)
    50.  Green  am  I,  and pink in the
       weave of my  shirt, yet the  red
       lines are  in my  eyes, and  the
       purple shadows under them.
    51. I mean really purple; it is the
       light high  as a  mountain, tall
       as a tree.  My toadie shall call
       this   light   "infrared,"  thus
       establishing his credentials  to
       create  a  system  of scientific
       illuminism.
    52. There is  some veal; that  veal
       is black.   It  is the  veal you
       bought for  dinner three  months
       ago; it is  the veal that  still
       lieth  in   the  back   of  your
       refrigerator.   Throw away  this
       fuzzy specimen of mycology!   Do
       this,  and  I  shall reward thee
       with  freedom  from  severe food
       poisoning.
    53.  Don't  worry,  kid,  you won't
       regret writing  this thing.  You
       are  perfectly  OK,  I swear it,
       and any minor discomfort you may
       feel  is  only  temporary,   and
       probably   just    psychosomatic
       anyway.
    54.  So  your  family,  loved ones,
       friends,   and   everyone   else
       you've   ever   respected  think
       you've  gone  off  the deep end?
       Big deal!  You know who you  can
       trust, right? The stops as  thou
       wilt; the  yields as  prescribed
       by state law.
    55.  Thou  shalt  learn  the entire
       English  Alphabet;  thou   shalt
       learn    to    construct   words
       therefrom.
    56.  Laugh  while  you  still  can,
       mockers!  They laughed at me  at
       the University,  but now,  now I
       will show them! Ahahaha!
    57. He that  is righteous shall  be
       righteous  still,  he  that   is
       filthy shall take a bath.
    58. Don't  go changing,  to try  to
       please me, I  love you just  the
       way you are.   Perhaps that  bum
       is a  King who  likes cheap  red
       wine.    A  King  can choose his
       refreshment  as  he  will;   the
       rabble  cannot  hide  their poor
       taste.
    59. Kill them all, and let Me  sort
       them out!
    60. Strike low, strike often;  kick
       them when they're down, so  they
       won't get up again!
    61. There is  a light before  thine       eyes,  a  light  undesired, most
       annoying.  Buy  a new shade  for
       your desk lamp.
    62. Your chest hurts, and the  roof
       is leaking.
    63. Just breathing is an effort.
    64. Oh!   You let your  guard down,
       we have you now: hail, hail, the
       gang's  all  here:  prophet of a
       Nut! prophet of the Odd! Prophet
       of Bar-B-Que!  Now rejoice,  and
       party, and write trashy novels!
    65. I am the Master; you will  obey
       me.
    66.  Write   and  work,   and  find
       ecstasy  in  bed!    Thrill with
       victory and  agonize in  defeat!
       Those who  see your  death shall
       be glad -- doesn't that make you
       feel just great?  I love you  so
       much  I  think  I'll  kill  you.
       Cheer  up!    We're  all in this
       together.
    67.  Hold!    A  little more to the
       left!    Keep  it  up!   Oh, for
       God's sake, don't pass out now!
    68.  Harder!    Faster!    Oh!  Oh!
       OH!!!
    69. Whew!   What do I  feel?  Am  I
       exhausted?  Not with this  verse
       number, I'm not.
    70.  There  are  other  ways,  too.
       Wisdom says: be rich! Then canst
       thou     afford     more    joy.
       Recrystallize  thy  rapture.  If
       thou drink, don't drive, if thou
       love,  do.    If  thou  do aught
       joyous,  don't  get  caught, and
       destroy all evidence.
    71. But go for the gusto!
    72. Grab more and more!  Live fast,
       die young, leave a  good-looking
       corpse.
    73. Ah!  Ah!  Death!  Death!  Thou!
       Thou!  Shalt!  Shalt! Long!   --
       excuse me, I got stuck.  Anyway,
       forget death.
    74.  Absence  makes  the Heart grow
       fonder.  He  who lives long  and
       desires death much is  obviously
       not very good at suicide.
    75. Aha!  Listen to the Secret Code
       Message:
    76. 20-N-Z  6-B-17-M  3-M-2-N-3-M-3
       16-6-C-15   18-14-N-11-5.   What
       the Hell  does that  mean?   You
       won't figure it out, that's  for
       sure.  Ten cometh after me; they
       shall read  it, and  weep.   But
       remember  --  even  if you don't
       understand  it,  you  can  still
       tell it to your friends.
    77. O be  thou proud and  macho and
       muscular, and  the Castro  shall
       be thine.
    78.  Thou  art  really something, a
       special kind of guy, truly  head
       and shoulders above the crowd, a
       standout, one-of-a-kind.   Thine
       head shall  expand to  encompass
       the stars.   They  shall worship
       thy name, and the number of  thy
       beverage 202.
    79.  The  end   of  the  filet   of
       Haddock,  and  so  long  to you,
       sucker.

       "CERTAIN ACTS" BILL MADE LAW

       President  Drakonian  signed the
    once  controversial  "Federal Anti-
    Crime Act" into law today.  The Act
    is  intended   to  strengthen   the
    Federal  Government  in  its war on
    Crime,   Drugs,   Terrorism,    and
    certain    other    problems     by
    centralizing     authority      and
    eliminating    legal     loopholes.
    According to the Act,  "Individuals
    suspected  of  committing   certain
    acts, conspiring to commit  certain
    acts, advocating  or condoning  the
    commission  of  certain  acts,   or
    associating with those who  commit,
    conspire to commit, or advocate  or
    condone the  commission of  certain
    acts, shall under the provisions of
    this  law  be  subject to immediate
    arrest, conviction, and application
    of   certain   corrective    and/or
    punitive measures..."
       President  Drakonian   expressed
    praise     for     Congress     and
    satisfaction with the new bill at a
    reception today before a  gathering
    of the National Conservative  Youth
    Front.   Said the  President: "This
    new measure will be a great help to
    us in our  ongoing efforts to  stop
    the most terrible threat in history
    to the American way of life, and to
    the values  and institutions  which
    have made this  country what it  is
    today.   We   applaud    Congress's
    courage  and  vision  in supporting
    our commitment  to stem  the rising
    tide  of  Crime  and  certain other
    problems,  and   to  cut   back  on
    bureaucratic  red  tape.    We also
    thank  our  good  friends  in   the
    Supreme  Court  for  their gracious
    assistance.  Decent citizens across
    the  country  may  rest  a   little
    easier  in  the  certainty that the
    forces  of  Freedom,  Justice   and
    Security  will   now  be   able  to
    operate  without  the  hindrance of
    the needless and costly formalities
    of times past."
       In spite of media predictions of
    widespread   demonstrations,    the
    government  is  not  expecting  any
    serious  trouble;  says   Drakonian    administration   spokesman    Peter
    Hammer.     According  to   Hammer,
    "Under  certain  provisions  of the
    Act,    certain    agencies     are
    authorized  to  implement   certain
    policies within a certain  boundary
    of  retroactivity.    Under certain
    circumstances, special task  forces
    may be created to expedite  certain
    phases  of  said  policies.    Said
    circumstances were considered to be
    fulfilled when certain  information
    was   received   through    certain
    channels   which   linked   certain
    individuals and organizations  with
    certain   other   individuals   and
    organizations known to be linked to
    violations of Law according to  the
    provisions of the Act.  Certain  of
    said task  forces were  immediately
    created, and under the direction of
    certain   officials,    immediately
    carried    out    certain     field
    operations.      Said   operations,
    through  the  effective utilization
    of certain  methods and  equipment,
    achieved desired results within the
    designated time  period."   Further
    details were not available.

      Notes from the Editor-in-Chief

               by Hagios Xao

       The last quarter here at  Hermes
    Camp   has   been   an  interesting
    period.  First off, just days after
    the  last  Breeze  was  mailed, the
    Xaos moved into  a new home.   Less
    than a month  later, a large  party
    was held at  our new place  for the
    First  Day  of  the  Writing of the
    Book of  the Law.   At  that party,
    TahutiNet was unveiled.   TahutiNet
    is a new computer "bulletin  board"
    system run as an outreach  activity
    of Hermes Camp.  This BBS completes
    the  downward  pointing  electronic
    triangle (with Tahuti at the  apex,
    of course) of which BaphoNet in New
    York  and  ThelemaNet  in  Berkeley
    form  the  other  two  points.  All
    three  systems  carry  three  "echo
    conferences,"  collectively  called
    MAGICKNET,  which  connect  Magick,
    Witchcraft, and Neo-Pagan  oriented
    BBS systems  across the  country in
    one large message base.  Also,  the
    three  OTO  boards  carry a special
    conference  available  only  to OTO
    members.    In  addition, TahutiNet
    can   be   used   to   download  an
    electronic version of the Breeze or
    to  upload   articles  for   future
    issues.   The numbers  for the  OTO
    BBS systems are:

    TahutiNet
        Eagle Rock, CA   (213) 258-5724
    ThelemaNet
        Berkeley,  CA    (415) 548-0163
    BaphoNet
        New York, NY     (718) 499-9227

       This  issue  also  marks a first
    for the Xao.   My courageous  wife,
    colloquially known as the UnderXao,
    has volunteered as my successor  as
    Editor of the Breeze and has  begun
    training  "the  hard  way."   (That
    means  that  she  has single-handed
    about 80% of  the work involved  in
    producing  this  issue.)    She has
    done a fine  job at the  formidable
    task  of  carrying  on  the  Breeze
    tradition of  high quality  content
    and presentation. (At least we  are
    not conceited!)

         Master of Ptah Sekhet Oasis,
    OTO Quartermaster

    4/29/88 e.v.

    Excellent Companion,

      Do what thou wilt shall be the
             whole of the Law

       The following Notice pertains to
    the OTO Quartermaster function  and
    parallels   a   similar   but  more
    serious notice  to be  published in
    the Link.

                  NOTICE

       Although Baphomet Lodge does not
    currently  have  a  Master, it does
    have a Past Master, a Half  Master,
    and now a Quartermaster.  Yes, I've
    been  cajoled  into  accepting  the
    responsibility of providing all OTO
    initiators with everything (nearly)
    they need  to perform  initiations.
    The first thing  I'd like to  do in
    the  context  of  Quartermastery is
    try  to  gather  together  a   good
    portion  of  the  Order's Wisdom of
    Experience  on  how  Man  of  Earth
    initiation temples  have been,  can
    and should be  put together.   I'll
    need your  help for  this.   Please
    send  your  stories  (success   and
    horror),   tips,   reccomendations,
    photos,  samples,  blueprints, etc.
    etc.  to  me  now  for compilation,
    analysis,      synthesis,       and
    redistribution.   I have  a special
    interest in  hearing from  those of
    you   who   might   be  willing  to
    actually  make   items  of   temple
    equipment  for  sale  to the Order.
    Please write  to the  Quartermaster
    at the following address:

           Ordo Templi Orientis
         22797 Barton Rd., No. 110
             Colton, CA  92324

       Or phone.  If you don't know the    pho e  number,  please  get it from
    someone who does.

     Love is the law, love under will.

          HUNCHBACKS AND SOLDIERS

    ?:  What  is  M...M...M...?    I've
    never come across it.
    ?:  What   is  the   diamond-shaped
    symbol   with   11   crosses  which
    Crowley sometimes uses in front  of
    his name?  I have seen some ads for
    jewelry  like  this  and  wanted to
    know what it meant.
    ?:  What  is  a  Viceroy?   Some of
    Crowley's letters  to Germer  refer
    to him as Crowley's Viceroy.

    !:  These  three  "hunchbacks" have
    been grouped together because  they
    can all  be answered,  at least  in
    part, by reference to one  historic
    document.
       There  exists  a  famous charter
    from   Mercurius   (James    Thomas
    Windram),    which    most   O.T.O.
    archivists have in their files.  It
    has been a standard from which many
    current forms and certificates have
    been   designed.      It  reads  as
    follows:

      "O.T.O. MYSTERIA MYSTICA MAXIMA

    Peace, Tolerance, Truth, Salutation
                  on all
    points of the Triangle, respect  to
                the Order.

    Know all Men by these presents:-
    That the  greatly honoured  Brother
    James  Thomas   Windram  Xo,   Most
    Puissant Sovereign Grand Commander,
    Absolute Grand Patriarch, Sovereign
    Grand  Master  General  and Viceroy
    for the  Union of  South Africa  by
    virtue of  his exalted  office, and
    under  the  authority  of  a Patent
    conferred  on  him  by  the   Grand
    Master Baphomet, dated Anno IX, Sun
    in  10o15'17"  Capricorn  Moon   in
    7o14'41"   Pisces,   does    hereby
    authorize and empower Venerable and
    right worthy  Frater Frank  Bennett
    VIIo,  and   Venerable  and   right
    worthy Soror  Veni Cooper  Matheson
    VIIo,  and  those  associated  with
    them to  constitute, hold  and rule
    the  _______  Lodge,  No.  2 on the
    Register  of  the  National   Grand    Council of the Ordo Templi Orientis
    for the Union of South Africa  with
    the right to work the Grades of the
    M...M...M...   Rite   subject   and
    according  to  the  Constitution of
    the O.T.O. and M...M...M..., in the
    City of Sydney, N.S.W.
       Given in the  name of the  Grand
    Master Baphomet,  and by  order and
    under  the  hand  and  seal  of His
    Excellency  the   Viceroy  of   the
    O.T.O.  for  the  Union  of   South
    Africa  this  15th  day of November
    1915 E.V."
       At   the   lower   left,  it  is
    "Sealed,  signed  and  delivered by
    us, Mercurius  Xo."   At the  lower
    right we find: "In witness  whereof
    I have hereunto  set my hand,  L.M.
    Yardley   VIIo,   Sovereign   Grand
    Secretary     General,      O.T.O.,
    M...M...M...,   Union   of    South
    Africa."    Each  prefixes his name
    with the  11-fold cross  concerning
    which    our    correspondent   has
    inquired.
       (1)   M...M...M...   stands  for
    "Mysteria Mystica Maxima"; that is,
    the degrees  from Minerval  through
    Prince   of   the   Royal   Secret.
    (Beyond this, beginning with  VIIo,
    is the O.T.O. proper.)
       Each   of   the   old   national
    sections  of  O.T.O.  had  its  own
    name,  such  as  Mysteria   Mystica
    Veritas, Mysteria Mystica  Aeterna,
    and  Veritas  Mystica  Maxima.  The
    British Order,  under Crowley,  was
    called Mysteria Mystica Maxima,  as
    were    all    national    branches
    springing    directly    from   it.
    M...M...M...   is   thus    roughly
    synonymous with what folks commonly
    call  "Aleister  Crowley's O.T.O.,"
    the  outer  O.T.O.  system   (below
    VIIo) as descended through Crowley.
    It is  no accident  that the  three
    initials enumerate to 120.
       (2)   The   so-called  "Baphomet
    Cross" is  a minor  variation of  a
    traditional Masonic insignia.   One
    official O.T.O. instruction  refers
    to it  as, "the  triple and  eleven
    fold Cross in the invisible Diamond
    which  a  member  of  our   Supreme
    Council     prefixeth     to    his
    signature," linking it specifically
    to Supreme Council members.  I have
    never seen  it used  in any  source    document except by a Grand  Master,
    Grand    Secretary,    or     Grand
    Treasurer.    The  female  form has
    curved serifs (see Leah  Bathurst's
    signature on p.   206 of  the "Blue
    Equinox").   Ignorance of  its true
    meaning  has  lead  many  to assume
    wrongly  that  it  is  a IXo cross;
    that it  is a  jewel for  anyone in
    O.T.O.; etc.  By traditional usage,
    it should be used only by the  four
    Grand     officers     and    their
    international counterparts.
       (3) There are  two forms of  Xo.
    Each  type  may  hold  the national
    administrative office called "Grand
    Master."  One is a "Supreme &  Holy
    King,"  appointed  directly  by the
    O.H.O.  (the  international  O.T.O.
    head).   The other  is a  "Viceroy"
    (Vice- King), appointed in  special
    circumstances by  a Xo  who is  not
    O.H.O.  Windram  was Xo Viceroy  of
    the  Union  of  South  Africa,  not
    Supreme & Holy King, because he was
    appointed  by   Xo  Crowley   (with
    O.H.O.   Reuss'   permission),  and
    reported   directly   to   Crowley.
    Similarly, C.  S. Jones  identified
    himself   in   one   document    as
    "PARZIVAL Xo  O.T.O., Deputy  Grand
    Master  General   of  all   English
    Speaking Countries, Viceroy of  His
    Most  Sacred  Majesty  BAPHOMET for
    the  Dominion  of  Canada."    Karl
    Germer was Xo  Supreme & Holy  King
    of  Germany;  but  when  he came to
    live in the U.S., we had a  Supreme
    &  Holy  King,  Wilfred  Smith (per
    appointment  by  O.H.O.  Crowley in
    1932).    Therefore,  though Germer
    retained   his   degree,   he   was
    addressed   in   correspondence  as
    Crowley's  Viceroy.    This gives a
    historic  precedent   for  two   Xo
    members living in one country, only
    one of whom is that nation's  King,
    the other being  a Viceroy of  that
    King or of another.
       The title  "Viceroy" should  not
    be  confused  with  Deputy ("Vice")
    Grand Master General.
