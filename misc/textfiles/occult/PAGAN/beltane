I SHALL GO AS A WREN IN SPRING          |   Women
WITH SORROW AND SIGHING ON SILENT WING  | 
AND I SHALL GO IN OUR LADY'S NAME       |
AYE, TILL I COME HOME AGAIN             |

AND WE SHALL FOLLOW AS FALCONS GREY      >   Men
AND HUNT THEE CRUELLY AS OUR PREY        >
AND WE SHALL GO IN OUR MASTER'S NAME     >
AYE, TO FETCH THEE HOME AGAIN            >

THEN I SHALL GO AS A MOUSE IN MAY       |   Women
IN FIELDS BY NIGHT AND CELLARS BY DAY   |
AND I SHALL GO IN OUR LADY'S NAME       |
AYE, TILL I COME HOME AGAIN             |

BUT WE SHALL FOLLOW AS FAT TOM CATS      >   Men
AND CHASE THEE THROUGH THE CORN AND VATS >
AND WE SHALL GO IN OUR MASTER'S NAME     >
AYE, TO FETCH THEE HOME AGAIN            >

WITH SORROW AND SIGHING AND MICKLE CARE |
AND I SHALL GO IN OUR LADY'S NAME       |

BUT WE SHALL FOLLOW AS SWIFT GREY HOUNDS >   Men
AND DOG THY TRACKS BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS   >
AND WE SHALL GO IN OUR MASTER'S NAME     >
AYE, TO FETCH THEE HOME AGAIN            >

THEN I SHALL GO AS A WINTER TROUT       |   Women
WITH SORROW AND SIGHING AND MICKLE DOUBT|
AND I SHALL GO IN OUR LADY'S NAME       |
AYE, TILL I COME HOME AGAIN             |
