I have uploaded this file as information only. By doing so, I am
not in any way recommending or attesting to the veracity or usefullness
of any material contained in any of the listed books. I have found
John (Ballantrae) to be an excellent source of out-of-print material
and there have been very few books that I have requested that he has
not been able to locate and I hope that he will be a valuable resource
for the members of this forum also.

SEX SYMBOLISM IN RELIGION (1922) J.B. Hannay. "All the Ideas in the Bible,
the nature of the Gods, the stories of creation, miracles, life and death,
the manner of sacrificing, worshipping, vowing, building altars, arks,
dress, altar furniture, and symbolism - in fact the entire religion as taught
us in the Bible - are absolutely and totaqlly founded upon and saturated with
Pallism; and the Phallic cult is that on which Christianity has been founded.
Phallism is sex symbolism, and all creative power in a god is symbolized by
the actual facts of creation of life in nature by means of the organs of sex.
In my preface to Christianity I wrote, 'Any work on the symbolism of 
religion, without treating its pahllic basis, would be like Hamlet without
the Prince of Denmark".
