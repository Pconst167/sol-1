     After spending several hours decoding the planetry hours 
     charts I decided that I would release this information unto 
     anyone that is capable of reading this ASCII text file.  I 
     hope that this file will be of use to you.  If not to you 
     then perhaps you can send it on to someone else.

                              *Blessed Be*

     Let me first try and convey the various symbols for the 
     planets to you and be in hopes that I do not confuse you 
     more.

     Sun      : Circle with dot in the middle, Archangel is 
                Michael
    
     Moon     : A moon shaped object, Archangel is Gabriel
  
     Mars     : A circle with an arrow point to the right out of 
                the top, Archangel Samael

     Mercury  : A circle with a cresent sitting on the top of it, 
                with cross below it, supporting it, Archangel 
                Raphael  
     
     Venus    : Looks like a four, archangel Sachiel

     Saturn   : A cross supporting a circle, Archangel Anael

     Jupiter  : A t with a two connected to it, Archangel Cassiel

     
     Okay you now posses a limited knowledge of the shapes, since 
     I do not have access to graphics to show them to you, a hope 
     that I have provided you with enough infomation.  (Please 
     note: Jupiters symbols can also appear as an h)

     Mercury, adaptability, and knowledge, Mercury is the 
     chameleon.

     Venus, Love, romanace, beauty, harmony, wealth, fame, 
     pleasure.  Venus is a serious planet, do not invoke venus 
     unless you intend to be serious (in other words, if you only 
     want someone to like you, invoke the moon not venus)

     Mars, Bellicosity, warfare, strength, passion.  Mars is hard 
     to control once invoked, it will not stop until it 
     vanquishes everything in it's path, it is also very powerful

     Jupiter, benevolence, generosity, judgement, good fortune, 
     the relegious life.  Jupiter represents expansion and 
     growth.

     Saturn, old age, limitations, discipline.  The key word for 
     saturn is crystillisation, saturn has a tendance to slow 
     things down.

     The Moon is it's 5 phases:

     New moon, new begginings

     Waxing moon, Construction

     Full moon, Completion (Most powerful phase of the moon)

     Waning moon, Draw within

     Dark moon, low energy (lowest point of the moons cycle)
