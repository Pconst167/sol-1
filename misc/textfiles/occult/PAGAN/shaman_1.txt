                         Abstract
 
Within the last 30 years a number of earthworks have been
built by artists, primarily in North America, but extant
examples are known elsewhere in the world.  These artworks
are not intended to be bought and sold or displayed within
the usual gallery-focused art distribution system.  They are
site-specific works, often located in remote, hard-to-reach
areas.  Curatorial documentation is sometimes incomplete.
Some artists do not even list their earthwork projects on
their resumes.  What then is the purpose of the contemporary
earthworks?  They appear to be similar in siting and
materials to archaic earthworks which we assume to be sacred
in intentionality.  Are the contemporary works also religious
statements of sacral orientation?
 
In this exploratory study, 203 questionnaires were sent to
artists throughout North America whose work seemed to show an
especial interest in earthworks, visionary experiences,
and/or nature.  (Half of the artists selected were female
artists, one-fourth were artists of self-identified
Amerindian ancestry, and half had Canadian addresses.)
Questions were asked of the artists concerning visionary
experiences, paranormal experiences, life crises, religious
background and current religious affiliation, among other
things.  The questionnaire return rate was 54.7% or 120
completed questionnaires.  Subsequent interviews were
conducted with 19 artists.
 
The findings of the survey indicate that for most of the
artists in the group--native and non-native alike, male and
female alike--their visions and paranormal experiences
inspire and authenticate their work as artists, work which
they themselves believe to be "healing" and linked to the
earth as sacred, a world in which they frequently encounter
"sacred places," power centers, and other experiences of mana
or kratophany.  In very special ways, the artists feel
themselves to be mediums for a sacred knowledge which they
believe comes from nature, from the earth, from the energies
of all life, of all time--but not from god or gods per se.
The artists appear to perceive the world as a self-contained
whole, a healing whole, and in their art they take part in
that healing whole.
 
Thus, the dissertation argues that the analogy of shaman as
artist (artist as shaman) is a useful one to make to
explicate the religious experiences of artists; that artists
can be studied as a group using the statistical profile
methods of social sciences; and that contemporary earthworks
may constitute a hitherto unrecognized body of sacred art.
If so, they are sacred places.
 
 
 
                      WORKS CONSULTED
 
 
 
The following list of articles, monographs, and interviews is
divided into nine parts arranged under two major headings--
primary and secondary documents.  Under the heading of
primary documents is one subheading for the list of first-
person statements by artists used in the study.  Some are
published articles and interviews.  Others are artists'
catalogue statements.  Still others are unpublished
interviews and letters, plus notes from telephone
conversations and informal meetings.
 
Under the heading of secondary documents are eight further
subheadings arranged with the hope that the reader will find
the subject listings helpful because the bibliography is both
lengthy and interdisciplinary.  Titles are not double-listed
under different headings.  Under art criticism will be found
articles about contemporary art and artists, particularly
with reference to earthworks, which were not written by the
artists being discussed.
 
Under shamanism, the reader can locate general writings on
shamanism and neo-shamanism.  Most of the titles listed are
for cross-cultural and/or comparative studies.  Tribal-
specific studies of shamanism and individual profiles of
shamans are also listed here, and studies of shamanism and
"primitive" and/or archaic art forms.
 
The listings for Amerindian traditions and culture comprise
a variety of items, including visual arts, but omitting
shamanism, having to do with the peoples of the first nations
of North and South America.
 
The psychology of art, creativity, and mysticism listings
are, for the most part, Western-oriented contemporary studies
of creativity in the visual arts, trance experiences, and psi
phenomena.
 
The religion and art listing includes studies which discuss
the relationship of art to religion and studies concerned
with the origin of religion (and/or art), especially those of
the Old World paleolithic and neolithic eras.  The listing
also includes some general work in religious studies typology
and "patterns" (Mircea Eliade's felicitiously chosen term) of
religiosity.
 
The section entitled topofilia includes studies of North
American cultural geography, ecology, eco-theology and geo-
piety.  Studies of architectonic space, particularly with
reference to contemporary North American culture and
religions, are listed here also.
 
The social sciences methodology section lists the how-to
titles which guided the survey design (questionnaire and
interviews), and the interpretation of the survey's findings.
 
Finally, miscellany as a subsection heading is just what its
title says--a catch-all list of reference books which I
consulted from time-to-time.

New Bibliography Available
 
     One of the objectives of the CONTENTS Project is to compile a freely
accessible collection of bibliographies of interest to any of the areas of
study within religious studies.  The CONTENTS Project encourages those who
have bibliographies that would be of interest to researchers to make these
available to others by submitting them for placement on the CONTENTS
fileserver.  Authors of major papers, thesis, dissertations and manuscripts
should consider making their bibliographies freely available to the academic
community.  Compilers retain the full copyright to their work.  Our intent is
simply to provide a cost free method of dissemination of research material.
 
For more information on how to submit a bibliography to the CONTENTS Project
fileserver, please contact the project director at 441495@Uottawa (BITNET) or
441495@Acadvm1.Uottawa.CA.
