=============================================================================
Martin Luther King's "Dream" speech planted the seeds of his dream for a
better life in the hearts of his people and through the years those seeds took
root and empowered many people to work toward a better world.  However, as a
Witch who considers every living thing on this planet kindred in spirit, if
not in flesh; I needed a broader vision.  So...

       I have a Vision
               of a world wherein
               the color of a person's skin
               does not preclude respect
               for the sacred spirit within.

       I have a Vision
               of a world in which
               *WHO* you love is less important
               than *THAT* you love.

       I have a Vision
               of a world in which
               it matters less *WHAT* you believe
               than that you
               strive to *PRACTICE* what you believe
               with *ABSOLUTE*
               respect for the right of others
               to practice what *They* believe.

       I have a Vision
               of a world in which
               Wealth is less important than
               Life, Love, and Health.

       I have a Vision
               of a world wherein
               the measure of a person's accomplishments
               is less in the power they wield
               than in the Beauty and Harmony they can create.


These words are my seeds.  May they take root in the hearts of kindred souls
until there is enough loving power behind them to make Vision REALITY.


Brightest Blessings
