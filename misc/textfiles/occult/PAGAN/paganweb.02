    The Pagan Strength Web is a new network within Circle Network
formed to protect religious freedom for Wiccans and other  Pagans
and to give spiritual support to those harrassed because of their
religion.  The  Web  emerged  this  October to get rid of Federal
legislation aimed at denying tax exempt status to Craft groups.

    Here are some ways to participate in the Pagan  Strength  Web
and help it with its work.

    Letter  Writers  -  The  Web needs people to write letters to
lawmakers about any legislation,  such as the Walker Bill,  which
threatens  religious freedom.  The Web also needs people to write
the mainstream news media with compliments of  good  coverage  of
Paganism and complaints of slanderous reports.

    Group  Contacts - In order to get calls to action out to even
more people more quickly  in  the  future,  we  are  compiling  a
special  list  of  group  contacts  for Pagan Rights work.  Every
Wiccan Coven,  Goddess Circle,  Magickal Lodge,  and other  Pagan
Group  that  wants  to  be  part  of  the  Pagan Strength Web and
notified of emergency alerts needs to select a contact person  to
be  responsible  for  quickly relaying information to the rest of
the group.  To be a group contact,  write the Web c/o  Circle  as
soon  as  possible  with  the  following information:  your name,
address, and phone, plus your group's name and orientation.  This
information will be kept confidential and used for  Pagan  Rights
alerts and other special reports only.

    Lawyers  -  Circle  is  compiling  a  special list of lawyers
interested in working with the Pagan Strength  Web  by  providing
counsel  to  individuals and groups in need and/or helping defend
Pagan  religious  freedoms  in  the  courts.  Interested  lawyers
should  contact  us as soon as possible with the following infor-
mation:  your  name,  address,  phone,  short  summary  of  legal
training  and experience,  background in Paganism.  Also,  please
specify what services you are willing to  donate  and  what  fees
would be charged for other services you may provide.

    Reporters - We need people to keep us  informed  of  positive
and  negative coverage in all types of media.  We especially need
people to monitor the  fundamentalist  Christian  media  for  in-
stances  of  slanderous attacks on Pagan religions.  In addition,
the Web needs people to report on  instances  of  discrimination,
harrassment  and  other  persecution,  as  well  as on efforts to
uphold Pagan religious freedom in your local  area.  Updates  and
reports  we  receive  on  Pagan Rights issues and actions will be
published in this  new  Pagan  Strength  Web  section  of  CIRCLE
NETWORK NEWS, unless those who give us reports specify otherwise.
In  cases  of  emergencies (such as the Helms Amendment),  alerts
will be issued by phone and through first class mailings.

    Contributors - The Pagan Strength Web needs money in order to
do  its work.  Money is needed to pay for printing and postage of
special mailings and is especially needed  to  pay  for  all  the
phone  calls we have made and are still making in connection with
Pagan Rights work.  Even  though  Amendment  705  died,  we  have
continued to make calls to stay updated on other legislation that
is  still  in the works.  In addition,  we have been on the phone
more than ever before providing help to Pagans who have been per-
secuted because of their religion (reports of some of these cases
are published on this page).  Donations,  large  and  small,  are
needed  in  order for the Rights services of the Web to continue.
All donations are still tax deductible.  Make checks  payable  to
Circle and specify that donations are for the Pagan Rights Fund.

    Magick Workers - The Web needs individuals and groups to send
healing  and  strength to Pagans who have been attacked for their
beliefs.  Remember them in your meditations and energy  workings.
Any  spiritual  support you can give to those in need does make a
difference.  Having experienced persecution  several  times  our-
selves,  we  know  this  very  well  --  the energy received from
Pagans, including those who had never met us, very much helped us
get through our times of crisis and helped give us  the  strength
to  continue  with  our work.  We hope that our readers will send
healing energy to everyone  listed  in  the  Circle  of  Strength
section in this and future issues.

           LEGISLATIVE UPDATE ... WALKER BILL, HR 3389

    The wording and intent of the Walker Bill is nearly the  same
as the Helms Amendment,  except that it does not mention Satanism
at all and it stands on its own,  rather than being an amendment.
Introduced  to  the  House  on September 19 by Congressman Robert
Walker of Pennsylvania,  it is presently in the  House  Ways  and
Means  Committee.  While the Helms amendment was defeated as well
as  the  similar  amendment  Congressman  Schulze  (a  friend  of
Walker's)  tried  to attach to the massive Tax Reform Bill in Oc-
tober, it appears that Walker is still trying to find some way to
get his bill, HR 3389, passed.

    The Tax Reform Bill may be considered by legislators as early
as  this  February or March,  and some of our contacts on Capitol
Hill have warned us that there may be another attempt to get  le-
gislation  passed  that  could affect tax exempt status of Wiccan
churches.

    PLEASE WRITE your Senators and Representatives right away and
state your opposition to the Walker Bill and any  similar  legis-
lation.  Focus  on  the  importance  of  preserving the country's
Freedom of Religion.  Keep us posted  on  your  efforts  and  any
replies you get from those you write.  Thanks!

   These pagans have been harrassed because of their religion.
  Please remember them in your healing meditations and rituals:

*   VIRGINIA THOMPSON, Box 5564, San Diego, CA 92105

    She  was  harrassed  on the job because of her Craft religion
    and in September was fired.  She is in the midst of  fighting
    her  dismissal  through legal channels.  Send her healing and
    strength.  Send energy for a speed and positive resolution to
    her case.  Please write her if  you  have  any  knowledge  of
    litigation regarding job harrassment due to Paganism.

*   ARTHUR of North Carolina

    In October,  he had his personal Druidic  altar  confiscated,
    and  other harrassment intensified.  In January,  he was dis-
    missed from the Army with a less  than  honorable  discharge.
    He  is  now contemplating a lawsuit.  Send him and his family
    healing and strength.

*   PAT TOBIAS, Spider's Web, 333 Beale Street, Memphis, TN 38103

    She and her magick shop were evicted from the previous  loca-
    tion  in  Spring 1985 because of her religion.  While the new
    shop location is working well,  she is now experiencing  some
    new  personal harrassment because of her religion.  Bless her
    and her shop with protection and success.  Please contact her
    if you know a good lawyer,  preferably near Memphis,  to help
    her on Pagan religious issues in court.

*   OZ in Abuquerque, NM

    This  past  Fall,  a  positive article appeared about Oz in a
    high school newspaper stemming from a  talk  she  gave  there
    explaining  the  differences between Satanism and Witchcraft.
    Some parents took offense that a Witch was allowed  to  speak
    in the schools and a slanderous attack on Oz  and  the  Craft
    was  broadcast  on  a show no a Christian television channel.
    Send Oz healing,  strength,  and protection so that her posi-
    tive work on behalf of the Craft can continue.

*   GROVE OF THE UNICORN, Box 13384, Atlanta, GA 30324

    Intolerant   "Christian  neighbors"  desecrated  the  Grove's
    outdoor Temple several times,  tearing down stones  from  the
    Circle,  stealing religious objects,  and planting a cross in
    the fire pit.  One of the desecrations was done in full  view
    of  TV cameras and shown on the evening news along with slan-
    derous attacks on the Grove and their Wiccan  religion.  Lady
    Galadriel  and  the  Grove have responded by going public and
    speaking out on the positive nature of the Craft to local and
    national media,  and the importance of freedom of religion in
    this  land.  The  Grove  is  filing lawsuits.  Send them spi-
    ritual support to help sustain them through  the  harrassment
    and  legal  battles.  Send  energy  so they cand find another
    site for their temple.  Send them money to help defray  their
    growing legal costs.

calls, networking, and magick.

circulation.
    *  Everyone who sent us copies of your letters to legislators

necessary  for us to state our thanks here instead of through in-
dividual letters to you.  Yet,  each of your letters was read and
very much appreciated.
    *  Everyone  who sent us donations for the Pagan Rights Fund.
Because of your financial support,  we were able to mail out even
more alert flyers and do other Pagan Rights work.
    *  Barry Lynn and the ACLU for all the work they did with 705
and for their continued work with us regarding other  legislation
still  pending.  If you would like to express thanks to them per-
