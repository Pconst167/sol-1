A MAN OF DOUBLE DEED
traditional
(music)

tHERE WAS A MAN OF DOUBLE DEED,
WHO SOWED HIS GARDEN FULL OF SEED.
WHEN THE SEED BEGAN TO GROW,
`TWAS LIKE A GARDEN FULL OF SNOW;
WHEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL,
LIKE BIRDS IT WAS UPON THE WALL;
AND WHEN THE BIRDS BEGAN TO FLY,
`TWAS LIKE A SHIPWRECK IN THE SKY;
AND WHEN THE SKY BEGAN TO CRACK,
`TWAS LIKE A STICK UPON MY BACK;
AND WHEN MY BACK BEGAN TO SMART,
`TWAS LIKE A PENKNIFE IN MY HEART;
AND WHEN MY HEART BEGAN TO BLEED,
THEN I WAS DEAD AND DEAD INDEED.
