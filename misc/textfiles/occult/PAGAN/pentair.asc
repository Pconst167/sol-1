                      THE SUPREME PENTAGRAM
                          RITUAL OF AIR

                       By Israel Regardie

                          Issued by the
                       Thelemic Order and
                    Temple of the Golden Dawn

1. Perform the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Earth Pentagram.
2. Perform the Lesser Invoking Ritual of the Air Pentagram.
3.  Face East. Feel breezes coming eastward or from the East, and
feel that the breeze or the windgusts of it goes right through
you, coming into the front and going out the back. After having
got the wind through, try to feel the wind as yellow.  See a
stream of yellow light emanating from this particular cardinal
point.
4.  Vibrate each of the following Names as often as you feel
inclined:

          SHADDAI EL CHAI     (Divine Name)
          RAPHAEL             (Archangelic Name)
          CHASSAN             (Angelic Name)

5. Visualize Sylphs -- little fairy-like figures. Let your
imagination run away with you as with the Gnomes, but do not
force it. Remember they are trying to subtilize, trying to
eliminate the gross, and are trying to make everything in which
the Light can function. Let the cramp of the mind go and let the
mind play with these fairy-like Sylphs. Feel that they are
pouring through you.
6. Recite the Invocation. It is the Prayer of the Sylphs.
REMEMBER YOUR IDEA OF GRATITUDE. You, too, must help them, even
as they are helping you. They have no consciousness in our sense
of the work.  Having no consciousness, they have no sense of
goal, and we must give them a concept of goal. And for the
benefit of all the Sylphs in our Nature we recite the Invocation
and we inspire them to our goal.

          Holy art Thou, Lord of the Air,
          Who has created the Firmamnet.
          SHADDAI EL CHAI.
          Almighty and everlasting, ever-living be Thy name
          Ever-magnified in the Life of all.
          We praise and we bless Thee, in the changeless empire
               of created Light;
          And we aspire without cessation unto Thy imperishable
               and Immutable Brilliance. Amen.

7. Perform Banishing Ritual.
8. Perform meditation.
