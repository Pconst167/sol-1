        Well, not exactly...Magicknet is/was a privately distributed echo that
was started mainly to let people know about some ickyness that was going on in
regards to some Anti-Pagan/Witch legislation...and grew...For the longest time
there was just Magicknet (the echo), which then absorbed Alternate_Religions,
a small, local Pagan echo which I ran. As things grew, it was split by the
moderator, Brad Hicks, into three separate echos: Magicknet, discussing things
relating to Pagan religions and Magick and Ceremonial Magick; Mundane, a pagan
"Chat" echo; and Metaphysical, a place for "magazine quality" articles.

        Then Brad stepped down as moderator due to time constraints and
such...and things continued to grow...so it was decided to "formalize" the
network, and call it something. The Pagan Distribution Network was the fav,
but due to the fact that it was already used in the Fidonet Nodelist for
somethingelse...we fell back upon the Pagan/Occult Distribution System, or
PODS.
