beliefs, practices, while showing how they evolved and their basis in
ancient Celtic belief...  

  We concieve our journal as a traditional Celtic publication...  We are not
neo-Pagans and our journal is not a neo-Pagan creation.  It is a traditional

nothing to do with ancient form, but that much can be learned by going to
scholars and Irish sources.  Cnl, emphasizes the study of Irish (Gaelige),
as a thaumatergic--liturgical language, believing a person's language
determines his/her reality.:  Articles, linguistics, discussions, book
reviews.  16-24 pages.  Subscriptions $9/year in U.S and Canada:  $11/year

The Druid's Progress:  The journal of Ar nDraiocht Fein ("Our own
Druidism") edited by P. E. I. Bonewits.  Scholarly emphasis.  Bonewits is
creating a Pan-European reconstructionist tradition of Neo-Pagan Druidism.
The journal is opinionated, intellectual, fascinating.  The organization is
hierarchial--or at least not democratic to the point of overthrowing the
Archdruid (Bonewits) himself-but really good for people searching for a
structured form of study on the Druidic path.  Discusses beliefs,
linguistics, training, history, research, art, music, ritual.
