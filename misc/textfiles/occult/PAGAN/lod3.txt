LORD OF THE DANCE
based on a Shaker tune

WHEN SHE DANCED ON THE WATERS AND THE WIND WAS HER FORM
THE LADY LAUGHED AND EVERY THING WAS BORN
SHE LIT THE SUN AND THE LIGHT GAVE HIM BIRTH
THE LORD OF THE DANCE THEN APPEARED ON THE EARTH

<CHORUS>
DANCE THEN WHEREVER YOU MAY BE
FOR I AM THE LORD OF THE DANCE SAID HE
AND I'LL LEAD YOU ON WHEREVER YOU MAY BE
AND I'LL LEAD YOU ALL IN THE DANCE SAID HE

I DANCED IN THE MORNING WHEN THE WORLD WAS BEGUN
I DANCED IN THE MOON AND THE STARS AND THE SUN
I WAS CALLED FROM THE DARKNESS BY THE SONG OF THE EARTH
I JOINED IN THE SINGING AND SHE GAVE ME BIRTH

<CHORUS>

I DANCE AT THE SABBAT WHEN YOU CHANT THE SPELL
I DANCE AND I SING THAT EVERYONE BE WELL
WHEN THE DANCE IS OVER DO NOT THINK I'M GONE
I LIVE IN THE MUSIC SO I STILL DANCE ON

<CHORUS>

THEY CUT ME DOWN BUT I LEAP UP HIGH 
I AM THE LIGHT THAT WILL NEVER NEVER DIE
I LIVE IN YOU IF YOU LIVE IN ME
I AM THE LORD OF THE DANCE OF THE DANCE SAID HE
