I WALK THE UNFREQUENTED ROAD
Frederick L. Hosmer
American folk hymn, 1835
(music)

I WALK THE UNFREQENTED ROAD
WITH OPEN EYE AND EAR;
I WATCH A-FIELD THE FARMER LOAD
THE BOUNTY OF THE YEAR.

A BEAUTY SPRING-TIME NEVER KNEW
HAUNTS ALL THE QUIET WAYS,
AND SWEETER SHINES THE LANDSCAPE THROUGH
ITS VEIL OF AUTUMN HAZE.

I FACE THE HILL, THE STREAMS, THE WOOD,
AND FEEL WITH ALL A-KIN;
MY HEART EXPANDS;
THEIR FORTITUDE
AND PEACE AND JOY FLOW IN.

I FILCH THE FRUIT OF NO MAN'S TOIL
NO TRESPASSER AM I,
AND YET I REAP FROM EV`RY SOIL
AND FROM THE UNMEASURED SKY.

I GATHER WHERE I DID NOT SOW,
AND BIND THE MYSTIC SHEAF,
THE AMBER AIR, THE RIVER'S FLOW,
THE RUSTLE OF THE LEAF.
