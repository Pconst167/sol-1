ALU MARI
ME PORTATES
SAY VOLETEIT
KAY ME SONATEE
ALU MAIRA OLA VIA
COSEE MAMALA DONA MIA
ALU MARI, ALU MARI
MENTRE COMPOTA JOA MARI

TO THE SEA, TO THE SEA
LET ME FOLLOW, TO SAME ME FROM
BURNING AND HEAL MY SORROW
TAKING THE WAY OF SAND AND WATER
THE TIDE WAY, THE LAST WAY,
TO LOVE MY MOTHER.

DOWN THE DUNES WITH SISTER
AND STRANGER
THE WICKED WOMEN WHO DANCE
IN THEIR DANGER
CRAVING THE BLESSING ALTOGETHER
OF GRASSES AND SEAWEED
SHELL AND FEATHER.

ALU MARI, ALU MARI
MENTRE COMPOTA JOA MARI

SO IN LOVE DOES MY LADY ENJOY ME
THAT DEATH BY DROWNING CANNOT DESTROY ME
LIFE ON THE TIDE WILL RUN BEFORE ME
THE LONG WAY, THE GRAY WAY
WILL CRY MY STORY

ALU MARI
ME PORTATEE
SE VOLETTE
KAY ME SONATEE
ALU MARI, ALU MARI
COSEE MAMALA DONA MIA
ALU MARI, ALU MARI
MENTRE COMPOTA JOA MARI
