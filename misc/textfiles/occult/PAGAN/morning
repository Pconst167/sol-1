MORNING HAS BROKEN
Gaelic melody
(music)
(apologies to Eleanor Farjeon)

MORNING HAS BROKEN, LIKE THE FIRST MORNING,
BLACKBIRD HAS SPOKEN LIKE THE FIRST BIRD.
PRAISE FOR THE SINGING, PRAISE FOR THE MORNING,
PRAISE FOR THEM SPRINGING FRESH FROM THE WORD.

SWEET THE RAIN'S NEW FALL, SUNLIGHT FROM HEAVEN,
LIKE THE FIRST DEWFALL ON THE FIRST GRASS.
PRAISE FOR THE SWEETNESS OF THE WET GARDEN,
SPRUNG IN COMPLETENESS WHERE HER FEET PASS.

MINE IS THE SUNLIGHT, MINE IS THE MORNING,
BORN OF THE ONE LIGHT GODDESS GAVE PLAY.
PRAISE WITH ELATION, PRAISE EV`RY MORNING,
GODDESS' CREATION OF OF THE NEW DAY.

MORNING HAS BROKEN, LIKE THE FIRST MORNING,
BLACKBIRD HAS SPOKEN LIKE THE FIRST BIRD.
PRAISE FOR THE SINGING, PRAISE FOR THE MORNING,
PRAISE FOR THEM SPRINGING FRESH FROM THE WORD.
