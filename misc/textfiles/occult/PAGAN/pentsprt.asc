                      THE SUPREME PENTAGRAM
                        RITUAL OF SPIRIT

We are dealing with a subject which is considerably more complex
to discuss than any which we heretofore had. It is the Fifth
Element -- Ether or Akasha. The ancients did not include this and
we have to look to the Alchemists for whatever we are able to
give out regarding it. As soon as we reach this Fifth Element, we
have difficulty in understanding what they meant. We have no
prayer for the Fifth Element; but that there is a Fifth Element
is fairly obvious. This Element is half manifest, half concealed.
The Alchemists pay attention to five Elements and to the
manipulating of this Fifth Element of Ether. The Fifth Element
synthesizes the Four Elements and yet although a synthesis is an
Element by itself, this Fifth Element is a duality.

We will use the truncated pyramid. A truncated pyramid is one
whose vertex is cut off by a plane usually parallel to the base.
(The vertex of a pyrmid is the point of intersection of the
generating lines or boundary planes respectively.) Each side of
the truncated pyramid is considered to be one of the elements,
Earth, Air, Fire and Water. The base is OLAHM (the World). The
top is ALEPH TAU -- the Alpha and Omega. Spirit, Essence, and
being directly involved here as the Fifth Element.

Imagine after thoroughly relaxing that you have built up a huge
pyramid. See that Pyramid built up with all the imagination you
have. You have to build up that Pyramid with the truncated top,
and see yourself standing at the top. The East side of the
Pyramid is Yellow in colour, the South is Red, the West is Blue,
and the North is Black. Expand your consciousness. Here, however,
we approach a different concept, not Elemental, but Spiritual. Up
to now we have dealt with the elemental side, the Green Ray. That
was to strengthen the interior basis of your nature, so that now
it will have something interior to work on. Enlarge your body to
fill infinite Space so the forces of God can pour through you.

Inasmuch as there are some of you able to do this Ritual twice a
day, I am going to give you variations of this in two ways
because I do not want it mixed up with other work -- not even the
Middle Pillar. Simply do this one thing. Of course you do the
relaxation. It is always a part of your formula and routine.

1. Perform the Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram.

2. Perform the Greater Invoking Pentagram Ritual of Spirit,
active and passive, then retire and face East.

3. Trace the Sign of Aquarius with your hand outstretched, and
vibrate the appropriate divine Names I gave you for the Element
of Air:

          SHADDAI EL CHAI
          RAPHAEL
          CHASSAN

Stand still and recite the prayer of Air, and at the same time
imagine that the Sylphs are there and pouring through you:

          Holy art Thou, Lord of the Air,
          Who has created the Firmament.
          SHADDAI EL CHAI.
          Almighty and everlasting, ever-living be Thy Name
          Ever-magnified in the Life of all.
          We praise and we bless Thee in the changeless empire
                    of created Light;
          And we aspire without cessation unto Thy Imperishable
                    and Immutable Brilliance. Amen.

4. Face South and trace the Sign of Leo. Then vibrate the
appropriate divine Names of Fire:

          YOD-HEH-VAV-HEH TZAVOOS
          MICHAEL
          ARAL

Stand still and recite the prayer of Fire, and at the same time
imagine that the Salamanders are there and pouring through you:

          Holy art Thou, Lord of the Fire,
          Wherein Thou hast shown forth the Throne of Thy Glory.
          YOD-HEH-VAV-HEH TZAVOOS.
          Leader of Armies is Thy Holy Name.
          O, Thou Flashing Fire, Thou illuminest all things
          With Thy insupportable Refulgence
          Whence flow the ceaseless streams of Splendour
          Which nourisheth Thine Infinite Spirit.
          Help us, Thy children, whom Thou hast loved
          Since the birth of the Ages of Time. Amen.

5. Face West and trace the Sign of Scorpio. Then vibrate the
appropraite divine Names of Water:

          ELOHIM TZAVOOS
          GABRIEL
          TALIHAD

Stand still and recite the prayer of Water, and at the same time
imagine that the Undines are there and pouring through you:

          Holy art Thou, Lord of the Mighty Waters
          Whereon Thy Spirit moved in the Beginning
          ELOHIM TZAVOSS
          Glory be unto Thee RUACH ELOHIM
          Whose Spirit hovered over the Great Waters of Creation.
          O, Depth, O inscrutable Depth, which exhalest unto
                    the height:
          Lead Thou us into the true Life, through sacrifice,
                    through Love,
          So that one day we may be found worthy to offer Thee,
          The Water, the Blood and the Tears, for the remission
                    of sins. Amen.

6. Face North and trace the Sign of Taurus. Then vibrate the
appropriate divine Names of Earth:

          ADONAI HA-ARETZ
          AURIEL
          PHORLAKH

Stand still and recite the prayer of Earth, and at the same time
imagine that the Gnomes are there and pouring through you:

          Holy art Thou, Lord of the Earth,
          Which Thou hast made for Thy footstool.
          ADONAI HA-ARETZ, ADONAI MELEKH.
          Unto Thee be the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory.
          MALKUTH-GEBURAH-GEDULAH. Amen.

          The Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of the Valley.
          O Thou Who hidest beneath the Earth,
                    in the Valley of Gems.
          The marvelous seed of the Stars.
          Live, reign, and be Thou the eternal Dispenser of
                    Thy treasures,
          Whereof Thou hast made us the wardens. Amen.

7. Return to the centre of the Temple where you are sitting, and
relax forthwith in the completest way possible.

8. Build up the Pyramid

          East side of Pyramid   YELLOW
          South   "    "         RED
          West    "    "         BLUE
          North   "    "         BLACK
          Base    "    "         BLACK
          Truncated TOP of Pyramid will be WHITE.

9. Then imagine that you are standing on the top of the Pyramid.
You are a vast figure of enormous size perched on an equally
large Pyramid, and feel that you are standing on that truncated
peak.

10. Then vibrate the Names:

          JEHESHUAH           (or HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT)
          JEHOVASHAH          (or RA-HOOR-KHUIT)

and whilst vibrating the Names, feel yourself being bathed with
Light, and then that power is coming through from every part of
space, making you glow with Light.

11. Get off the Pyramid. Wait of course on top, and when you get
the impulse to do so, get down. This is a test. I am not telling
you what side. You go down to the bottom of the inside of the
Pyramid, and remember I am not telling you what side you go into
the Pyramid, or what side you go out.

12. Inside the Pyramid you vibrate once more the Divine Names:

          JEHSHUAH           (or HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT)
          JEHOVASHAH         (or RA-HOOR-KHUIT)

and then four other additional Names. They are four words of five
letters each:

          EXARP               (pronounced  X - R -Pay)
          HCOMA               (    "       Hay - Co - Mah)
          NANTA               (    "       En - En - Tah)
          BITOM               (    "       Bay - E - Toe - Em)

          These are Enochian Spirit Names.

13. Then wait quietly inside. Do not try to make things happen or
formulate things in your imagination. If you get ideas, feelings,
or any other concepts, note it, because you are going to record
it always in your own notebook. Wait there quietly for some while
until you feel the Meditation has come to the end.

14. Then ascend once more to the top of the Pyramid and feel
yourself once more bathed with Light. Then as you stand on the
top of the Pyramid recite the Invocation:

15.       JEHESHUAH, JEHOVASHAH (or HOOR-PAAR-KRAAT, RA-HOOR-
          KHUIT).
          I invoke ye, ye Angels of the Celestial Spheres whose
                    dwelling is in the Invisible.
          Ye are the Guardians of the Gates of the Universe.
          Be ye also the Guardians of the Inner Shrine.
          Keep far removed the evil and the unbalanced.
          Strengthen and inspire me so that I may
                    preserve unsullied
          This abode of the Mysteries of the Eternal Gods
          Let my Sphere be pure and holy, so I may enter in
                    and become a partaker
          Of the secrets of the Light Divine. Amen.

16. Then when you feel you have enough, draw in and perform the
Banishing Ritual.

Note:  You can lie or sit down, but when you do the exercise you
have to build up in your imagination yourself standing on this
Pyramid. Remember that your inner body is capable of extending,
so if you train yourself to grow in actial practice you do grow.
It is your own inner form in which consciousness lives so that it
expands. Sit down, and imagine that while you are sitting it is
still you or your form getting bigger and bigger.

Let me impress upon you again the great importance of this
exercise. Take a few minutes and record the result of your
Meditation in your note book as soon as you are finished. You are
put to a test in order to see how your own inner consciousness
will act, as to getting on the Pyramid and how you get off, and
what you see when you get in. This is a test and this is an
efficient way to find out your progress. It is not easy. It is a
fight to the finish.
