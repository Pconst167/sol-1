
THE PACE EGGING SONG
traditional       a spring equinox song

[CHORUS]
HERE'S ONE TWO THREE JOLLY LADS 
ALL IN ONE MIND
WE HAVE COME A PACE EGGING
AND WE HOPE YOU'LL PROVE KIND
AND WE HOPE YOU'LL PROVE KIND 
WITH YOUR EGGS AND STRONG BEER
FOR WE'LL COME NO MORE NIGH YOU
UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR

AND THE FIRST THAT COMES IN IS LORD NELSON, YOU'LL SEE
WITH A BUNCH OF BLUE RIBBONS TIED ROUND BY HIS KNEE
AND THE STY ON HIS BREAST IT LIKE SILVER DOES SHINE
AND I HOPE HE REMEMBERS IT'S PACE EGGING TIME

[CHORUS]

AND THE NEXT THAT COMES IN IS HIS LORD FALLENWOOD
AND HE FOUGHT WITH LORD NELSON TILL HE SHED HIS BLOOD
AND HE'S COME FROM THE SEA, OLD ENGLAND, TO YOU
AND HE'S COME A PACE EGGING WITH THE WHOLE OF HIS CREW

[CHORUS]

THE LAST THAT COMES IN IS OLD TOSSPOT, YOU'LL SEE
HE'S A VALIENT OLD MAN AND EVER HE'D AGREE
HE'S A VALIENT OLD MAN AND HE WEARS A PIGTAIL
AND ALL HIS DELIGHT IS IN DRINKING STRONG ALE

[CHORUS]

COME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SIT BY THE FIRE
PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS AND GIVE US OUR DESIRE
PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS AND TREAT US ALL RIGHT
IF YOU'LL GIVE NOT, WE'LL TAKE NOT
FAREWELL AND GOODNIGHT

[CHORUS]
