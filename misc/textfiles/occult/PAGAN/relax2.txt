    DEEP BREATHING

    Close  your  eyes...Get yourself comfortable.  Pay careful attention to
    your breathing.  Recognize how slow and deep  breathing  will  help  to
    induce  relaxation.   Exhale,  then  take a deep breath in through your
    nose and blow it out through your mouth.  Breathe  from  your  abdomen,
    deeply and slowly.  Allow your abdomen to rise and fall as you breathe.

    With  each  inhale  and  exhale,  count your breaths.  count ONE on the
    inhale and TWO on the exhale.   Focus  only  on  the  breath  and  your
    counting.

    If  a  thought  comes  into your mind which causes you to lose track of
    your counting, just return to the count.

    If a thought comes into your mind, look at it as though it were someone
    else's.  Neither grab hold of it nor chop it down.  Neither stop it nor
    pursue it.  Simply  watch  it  come  into  view  and  disappear.   Then
    continue your counting.

    Count  your  breaths until you feel deeply relaxed.  Breathe in and out
    slowly, counting each breath, until you feel quiet, relaxed, and  still
    alert.
