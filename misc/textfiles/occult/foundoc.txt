OMNet, the Occult and Mysticism Network

_Foundation Document_, dated 940320 (Equinox)

PURPOSE

The purposes of this organization shall be to facilitate public access
to occult and mystical documents and social groups, and to promote
interdisciplinary information exchange.


FOUNDATION STATEMENT

For the purposes of this organization, the terms 'occult' and 'mysticism'
shall be defined as follows:

By 'occult' we shall mean any discipline of Divination (such as chiromancy,
cartomancy, necromancy, etc.), Astrology, Numerology, Alchemy, Qabalah,
or Ritual Magick.  It shall not include such things as Psychicism,
Spiritualism, Fortune-telling, Herbalism, Hypnotism, or any of the various 
forms of Therapy or Massage.

'Mysticism' shall include disciplines of Liberation, Awakening, Purification,
those involving a direct relationship, or unification, with 'the divine',
etc., especially as separate from any religious systems in which they may
be found.  It may also tangentally include attendant philosophy or
mythology which serves as an underpinning, result or functional mechanism
of any mystical discipline.


INITIAL FOCUS

The context of initial activity shall be what is popularly called 'the
Internet' or 'cyberspace', and it shall consist of maintaining and
revising the document which has been released as 'the Mage's Guide to
the Internet'.

Subsequent efforts may include the establishment of a membership
(organizations, individuals) based upon participation in fulfulling
the purposes of OMNet.

Other possible activities may include the establishment of a mechanism
by which various groups within the Internet (and perhaps later, society
at large) may be monitored, with pertinent documents combined, distributed
to membership and made available to the interested public (such as through
the distribution to ftp sites).


LONG-RANGE

Should the usefulness and success of this organization allow, OMNet shall
extend itself beyond cyberspace and become a legal entity, serving
nonprofit, educational purposes if and as so dictated by its administrators.


THE ss (subservant)

OMNet shall be represented by its subservant (ss), initially Tyagi Nagasiva,
who shall, while adhering strictly to the purposes stated above, meet the
needs and directives of the membership.  Should the membership be without
unified voice or resolved authority, then the ss shall be vested with the
power to decide any particular issue after a reasonable period of discussion
has concluded (as determined by the ss).

Aside from dismissal or undue hardship, the membership shall assign the ss
to any task within OMNet that they feel is appropriate, except where this
assignment would compromise the ss' ability to faithfully and accurately
represent OMNet to the public at large.

The term of office for the ss shall be life or until that individual sees fit
to burden another with said responsibility.  The ss shall appoint and/or
employ any needed assistants to perform the duties laid out above in service
to OMNet and its membership.

The ss has absolutely NO authority with regard to membership decisions,
with the exception of unresolved authority as stated above, though if the
membership so wishes it, it may consult with the ss as per its needs/desires.

When no membership exists beyond that of the ss, then that individual
shall determine the precise nature of 'best service' in regards fulfilling
the purposes of OMNet above.  In this circumstance, the ss shall take
whatever measures are necessary for the preservation of the sanctity of
the organization.


ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

The membership shall initially be a consensus-based structure that may
reform itself into any political edifice which it agrees shall best serve
the purposes of the OMNet.  By 'concensus-based' we mean that all
members must understand and assent to actions taken by the whole.

Subsequently, any ambiguity of authority that cannot be resolved by the
membership (as described above) shall be adjucated by the ss, and this
is the only official role which the ss may take in the political structure
of the organization aside from advisor, counsel, and representative.

Example:
The membership decides to become a monarchy.  All membership accepts a
'King and Queen' to rule them.  At some point a member questions the
legitimacy of this rulership and the authority of the regents.  There is
discussion and the dissenting member is not persuaded.  The ss then
hears both cases and decides as to the legitimacy of the regents.

Should any membership structure collapse, then it shall revert to a
consensus-based organization once more.

Other details of organizational structure are to be defined and handled
by the membership as it sees fit.

Examples:
Method of becoming a member
Membership status differences and authority for each
Responsibility and roles of individual members beyond that outlined above
