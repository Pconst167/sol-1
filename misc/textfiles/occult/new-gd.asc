        Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.

There is now  emerging  in the  world  a  New Order of the Golden
Dawn.  It is a Magical Order dedicated to  the vital perpetuation
of the teachings of Aleister Crowley and Israel Regardie. It is a
Royal  Academy  of  Adepts who  teach  the  Sacred  Mysteries  of
Ceremonial Magick,  Tantra,  Alchemy,  Qabalah, Tarot, Astrology,
and Yoga. Its  chief function is to  initiate aspirants  into the
Royal Life of  the Law of Thelema and to administer unto the wise
the Secret of Secrets in the Holy of Holies.

The New Order  of the  Golden Dawn  is  a  Thelemic  Organization
devoted to the magical development of a New Race  of free men and
women who are consecrated to the Law of Thelema  which is the Law
of Liberty. Its members are  pledged to  the dynamic creation and
essential  establishment of  a  New Civilization governed by that
One Law of the New Aeon of Horus, and  their principal work is to
uphold that  obligation by fulfilling the Law itself, that is, by
doing their own true Wills.

The  Thelemic Order  of the Golden Dawn now operates as an active
International Organization under the direction and supervision of
Christopher S. Hyatt and  Sir David Cherubim  of  Falcon Press in
association with the Israel Regardie Foundation, Inc.  Initiation
Ceremonies,  Correspondence Lessons,  Newsletters, Classes, etc.,
are available for interested aspirants. Call or write for further
information.

                Love is the law, love under will.


                      Frater Superior Chief
