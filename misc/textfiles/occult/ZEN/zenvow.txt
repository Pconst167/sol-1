THE VOW OF THE 'TEN FOOTSTEPS'

USED BY 'TRUE FOLLOWERS'

OF CH'AN TAO CHIA

I will have compassion
for all sentient beings;
and will not cause needless hurt
or unnecessary harm.

Through my training,
I will seek enlightenment,
the distinction between right and wrong,
liberation from delusion
and the malevolent influences of
greed, jealousy and rage.

I will seek
to transcend unnecessary dichotomy,
and learn to accept that differences
are often an attitude of mind.

I accept
that of greater value
than the accumulation of goods,
are justice and creativity,
right motive and action, and essentiality,
love and peace, and the freedom to grow.

I will act
with honour,
without contriving for self-advantage
or egotistical effort,
false pride or humility.
I will try to live my life
so as not to give cause
for later regrets.

I will help
those who are suffering,
or disadvantaged,
and those who seek liberation
or enlightenment.
