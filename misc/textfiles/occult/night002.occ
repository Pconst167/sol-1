
After many millenniums of experience there is a Soul who is qualified to
become a  Planetary Soul.  The Planetary Soul is the Soul for every person
upon that planet.  Think  of a pie sliced into an incredible number of pieces
of pie.  The pie as a whole is the  Planetary Soul and you are one of those
pieces of the pie. The Earth is the physical body  of a very advanced Soul who
I have told you is the Ancient Dragon Tiamat.  Many of  humankind have named
this Soul, Gaia/Pan. This name representing the fe/male aspect  of the Earth
Soul.  Every human being is a part of the Soul of Earth.  Moreover every part
of our human body, that is causal, mental, emotional, etheric and physical is
directly  effected by the Earth Soul.  Our entire existence is constantly
effected by the Energies of  this Being which plays upon our own energies.
Just as you are developing and evolving  magickally so is Soul Earth.  Soul
Earth's evolution is far greater then that of yours but all  are aiming
towards the One Goal; every greater unfoldment of Night Consciousness.  You
must take care of the Earth Body.

It is your stage upon which you gain magickally and moreover it is the vehicle
through  which Gaia/Pan gains magickally and has its physical being.   If the
body of Tiamat is  killed then the Soul will leave it just as if your body is
killed your soul must leave it.  If  there is continued pollution and
destruction of planetary life and resources then soon  Tiamat will have to rid
itself of the cancer that is causing physical destruction.  I believe  all of
humankind should take this as a warning.  It has happened before and it will
happen  again, Tiamat will not allow the death of its physical body before its
proper time.  It will do  what is necessary to stop the destruction of its
body just as you would.   There is also  another type of destruction happening
on Earth and that is with alien races from the Yang  matrix.

I know this subject may be tough for you to deal with but consider it as you
have  everything else, with an open mind. This planet is a battlefield between
Yang races and the Night Soul of this world, Tiamat.   The opening poem was
not just a piece of fiction.   There are still Yang races who desire  to
possess the Earth for its wealth and who enjoy dominion over human beings.
There  are other Yang races who plan to slowly convert the Yin souls of this
world into Yang  souls.  To change the basic polarity of all souls on this
world.  They believe that their  polarity is the only appropriate polarity and
would see the destruction of the Yin matrix of  life.   What evidence is there
of this?

I can point out to you books on the market today that deal with alien
visitation and kidnapping in which there are biological experiments going on
to create a human/alien  yang body in which they plan on placing Earth yin
souls in order to ultimately change the  polarity of the souls.  Turning back
to the pie example given earlier, think of what happens  to the pie if pieces
of it are removed never to be returned.  I believe Soul Death is an
appropriate term.   You can look at the Yang religions that were introduced by
the so-called gods or god and see that through their magickal practices they
slowly change a  soul's vibration from Yin to Yang. These of course are the
religions that have no  tolerance for other religions and have gone to great
lengths to force conversion on others  such as Christianity.  There is also my
own personal experience.  I will not go further in  discussing my personal
experience except to say it wasn't pleasant and could have led to  my ultimate
destruction.  What can you do?

You will learn many things to do in Night Magick.  You will learn to place
your body in attunement with the Yin Force of this planet.  You are learning
to unite with the  consciousness of the Oversoul which is one in consciousness
with the Planetary Oversoul.   If enough human souls accomplish this the Night
Force will become too strong for the  Yang races to deal with. You have
learned to take care of the Earth.  Go out and help  environmentalists who
promote care of the planet.   When you feel physically well the rest  of you
responds in kind and so it is with the Earth.  If the Earth Body is strong and
healthy  the Earth Soul will be strong and its aura will repel the alien
races.  In your meditations  and visualizations, see the Earth and Its Soul
strong in the Night Force.  Use your Night  Pillar and extend its protection
around and through the Earth.  Use your Night Pillar  around every human body
and soul to keep them strong in the Night Force.  If enough of  humankind
joins in there will be no destruction of the Yin life force.  If you think
that  aliens are fiction, DON'T.  If you practice Night Magick you will draw
their attention to you.   I have had personal experience with aliens and my
battle with them continues.  I advise  you strongly to wear your Night Amulet
and Ring at all times and keep your Night Pillar  strong through constant use.
I hope you will take my advice and not have to learn through  experience.

This is the Earth Realm where you have to live and practice Night Magick.  In
Earth  Magick, I will introduce knowledge, rites, and exercises which will
help to improve and  refine your physical body.   To make your body a more
sensitive instrument to the Night  forces around you.  The more refined the
instrument the greater the Night Power that will  be able to be expressed
through it.  These exercises will not only benefit the physical but  overlap
into the development of the higher vehicles too.  Earth Magick will give you
ultimate control over your physical body and the world around you.  So study
with all your  heart, persevere, practice, have courage and patience and you
will attain the Earth.  Your  first subject for study and practice in the
Earth Realm is Night Breathing.

14.  Night Breathing    

Breathing is an important aspect in life and Night Magick. Breathing is
essential to life  and your well-being.  That may seem like an obvious
statement since without air you  could not live, but actually breathing means
more then just taking in air to sustain life.  As  you will see, breathing
correctly and with the knowledge of what it can do for you will  propel you
far down the magickal road.  Incorrect breathing leads to many problems in
your life.

Does it seem that you run out of energy well before the day is done?  Are you
often  nervous and irritable for no real apparent reason?  Through correct
breathing you can  eliminate these problems from your life.  You will be able
to go through each day with  boundless energy. Tension, irritability, and
nervousness will disappear from your life.   What is wrong with the way you
breathe?

Stop right now and notice how you are breathing.  Do you find that your
breathing is  shallow? Almost everyone in the world is a lazy breather.  Deep
breathing is a simple  thing to do but in the beginning it will take some
effort on your part for it to become a  regular practice.  Begin by taking a
slow, deep breath and as you inhale, not only expand  your chest to hold more
air but force out your abdomen and feel that air going deep down  into your
lungs.  When you have inhaled as much air as you can, try to take in just a
bit  more air.  Really fill up your lungs. Now that you have inhaled as much
air as possible,  exhale very slowly and steadily.  Bring your expanded
abdomen in and force out the air  till you are completely empty.  At no time
should you strain yourself in doing deep  breathing.  Even though you cannot
go around in public being very obvious about this  exercise you should, no
matter where you are, breathe as deeply, slowly, and  rhythmically as
possible.  You will do this consciously at first but soon this will become a
part of your life without thinking of it.  Do this and you will have a
vibrant, youthful body.   Why would an increase in air intake cause this
increased vitality?

There is an active, vital, life force that energizes the world around you.  In
the Eastern languages this essence is called Prana.  This Force is active not
only on the physical  plane but on all planes or dimensions of life.  On the
physical level, you breathe in the air  which contains one aspect of this
Force and which then is transmitted throughout your  body via the nerve
network.  When you are feeling nervous, irritable, or tense, this can be  due
to a lack of this vital Force.  The Pranic Force is not just for the physical
body.

There are many aspects of the Pranic or what is called in Earth Magick, Earth
Force.  To  utilize the Earth Force, you must learn to draw in this Energy
within you.  The technique  outlined is termed Night Breathing. To begin with,
retire to your Magician's Study and sit comfortable with spine erect in your
chair.  For a few minutes practice deep breathing with your feet on the floor
and touching.  Your hands should be resting in your lap, palms down at all
times.  The indrawing of the  Earth Force is through the action of the mind
rather then the physical act of breathing.  As  your attention has been on the
physical act of breathing let's now move it to the Earth  Force surrounding
you.

This Force is the Life of the world.  Through it you have your well-being.
Your mind must remain in a state of complete openness to the Earth Force.
Your mind must be  completely centered in the Earth Force alone.  The mind
must be without strain.  You  must not force the indrawing of the Earth Force.
It is breathed into your being through a  conscious attunement to it. Feel the
Earth Force entering into your body.  See it  penetrating every cell in your
body and causing them to be filled Earth Light.  Know that  as it fills your
physical body with Earth Light and Life that the Earth Force also charges
your higher bodies with this same Emerald Light. As you continue to absorb the
Earth  Force know that you will achieve a Oneness with it.  You will lose
identity with your  physical body and forget physical limitations for in the
Earth Force there are no limits.   You are the Earth Force, Limitless and
Free.  Through Night Breathing, you will become  filled with the Earth Force.
This Force will keep your body in Eternal Youth.  You will be  free of
sickness. You will have abundant energy.  Not only does the Earth Force
quicken  the physical but also the Emotional Body.  Your outlook on life will
improve.  It will raise  the vibration of your body so that depression,
loneliness, and fear will not have a part in  your world.  The Night Force
transforms the Mental Body.  It can give you perfect memory.   Your mind and
all that it can do will be greatly enhanced.  Your memory will be able to
search back to when it first was.  The Earth Force will help raise your
overall Being into  Night Consciousness.  In addition to the practice of Night
Breathing and the use of the Earth Force you must also study and practice the
art of the Magician's Meditation.

15.  The Night Magician's Meditation    

The Night Magician's Meditation is the beginning level at which you will begin
to awaken  your Inner Self.  It is an exercise that is essential to your
magickal growth.  In the  beginning stages of meditation, your sense of
awareness will take place from your  physical awareness, but as you grow your
conscious awareness will move into your  Oversoul.  There are many benefits
that can be derived from meditation.

Meditation will greatly benefit your health.  The body will become inwardly
calm and tranquil.  The practice of Magician's Meditation can help to
eliminate ulcers and other physical problems due to stress and tension.  What
meditation can do for you physically it  can also do for you emotionally.

You can achieve a state of emotional tranquility and stability never before
thought  possible. No matter the confusion going on around you, you will be
able remain steady  and firm as a rock. It will develop your ability to
concentrate and to expand the workings  of your mind.

You will be able to achieve true telepathic communication with those of
similar magickal standing.  Your memory will be vastly enhanced.  Ideas from
the Higher Mental Realm  will come to you. From the Mental Realm, you will be
able to contact and obtain  information from the Akashic Record.  This Record
I will speak of later.  You will be able  to know the past, present, and
future probabilities for yourself and for others.  You will be  able to gain a
true understanding of your life and why you are here. There are  preparations
and precautions to take prior to meditating.

First, you must watch the food you eat.  You must avoid fried foods and spicy
foods close  to the meditation period.  Do not eat just prior to meditating
for a full stomach can be  quite discomforting.  You will then need to set a
quiet period aside each day.  This period  should be at the same time each day
if possible.  Early morning or late evening will be  the best time. You should
feel refreshed when you meditate so wash up prior to  commencing.  Now that
you have taken care of your bodily needs it is time to set the  proper
atmosphere for meditation.

Retire to your Magician's Study and be sure that you can not be disturbed for
say a half  hour. Put on your robe, light your incense, and sit down in a very
comfortable chair.  Do  not light your candle for the flickering will tend to
distract you.  Once you have done this  you are ready to begin the Magician's
Meditation.

Close your eyes now and place the Night Pillar around you. Follow this with
Night  Breathing. Now select the type of meditation.  There are actually two
ways of meditating,  and they differ by your conscious directive. The first
way of meditating will have you direct your thoughts on a particular subject.
For example, the subject can be on strength.  You will want to look at the
different types of strength.  Try to understand how strength develops and how
you can become stronger.   You can go on to becoming Pure Strength and the
qualities needed in your life to be  Strength.  As you continue to look fully
at the subject of strength and understand all that  there is about it your
conscious thoughts will slowly be overshadowed by your Oversoul,  and you will
be given true enlightenment on Strength, or any subject you should choose.
The second way deals with entering the Silence of your Oversoul.

Here you will not choose a topic but remain in a state of silence and complete
Openness  to the Indwelling Oversoul.  You must remain completely free of
thought.  You must not  enter into this meditation with cares or worries but
surrender them into the care of your  Oversoul.  As you advance into the
meditation you will become aware of Its Presence.   You will feel Its Energy.
Here the Oversoul will choose the subject of importance and  instruct you
directly. Remember, "to be Silent and Know".

Having chosen the type of meditation, turn your attention to within yourself
and give open recognition to the Oversoul within. If you feel a slight sense
of shaking or a raising of the  heart beat do not let it bother you.  It is a
good sign that what you want is taking place.   Remain very relaxed and allow
your thoughts to drift on the subject.  Do not overtire  yourself. If at first
you can only do five to ten minutes then that's fine. Do not push for
results.  The results will come in their own good time.  Meditate only as long
as you feel  comfortable with it. After you have finished don't get up and
plunge back into the work-a-day world.  Take it easy and allow yourself a few
minutes or however long is necessary to  adjust to a faster pace of living.
In Magician's Meditation, you slowed your rate of living  considerably.
Strive to attain but be patient for the results to happen.  You will not
attain  all you can be overnight but someday the Night will be yours.  There
is nothing greater  you can do for your quest on the Night Road then the
sincere practice of Night Magician's  Meditation.  In Night Magician's
Meditation you studied a method of changing your  conscious vibration and
attuning it with the Oversoul's Consciousness.  Now you are going  to explore
the very depths and heights of the Realm of Vibration. 16.  The Realm of
Vibration

The study of vibration is important to a Night Magician.  The actual magickal
progression made is a result of increased vibration of the physical,
emotional, mental, and causal  bodies. You must therefore begin with the
lowest level of vibration, the physical, and  study its nature.

Vibration is movement.  In the physical world, vibration is based on molecular
motion or movement.  The physical world is composed of small particles in
motion which are termed molecules. Molecules are composed of small particles
known as atoms.  Atoms are  composed of even smaller particles which are
protons, neutrons, and electrons.  If you  could become small enough you would
see that the electrons orbit around the nucleus  like the planets around the
Sun.  If you took the analogy farther, you would see that the  human body
would be composed of many solar and galactic systems.  The human body is  in
constant molecular motion which produces something akin to electricity.  There
are  machines today which can measure this very fine electricity.  The
combination of this fine  electricity added to the Energy of the Oversoul
causes sentient life.  All forms of matter  produce this fine energy due to
molecular motion.

Further, all matter, that is the mineral, plant, and animal kingdoms, are
guided in development, just as you are, by a Higher Power and therefore have
Life.  This Life is  perhaps not as you know Life, but yet it is Life.  As you
have seen, all forms of matter have  molecular activity.  This molecular
activity is very active in some forms and slower in  others.  The rock has a
very slow molecular, or vibrational rate, whereas the air has a very  high
vibrational rate.  This rate of vibration is termed frequency.  When the
vibrational rate  is high the frequency is high and the opposite is also true.
You have learned that matter  is in a constant state of motion.  That all
motion has a relative vibrational rate, or  frequency, dependent on the
molecular activity.  An important part of the physical realm of  vibration
which goes on to touch all levels of vibration is light and color.

Light and colors are dependent on matter and its rate of vibration.  Color is
important in  your physical life.  In a moment, you will discuss how it
effects the human body, but some background information on light and color
will prove beneficial. Light is energy.  Light is actually electromagnetic
radiation. When light strikes an object the molecules absorb  some of that
energy, and in turn, that which is not absorbed is reflected and radiated out
into the surrounding space.  This radiation is perceived by the eyes as color.
The  different colors seen are due to the different frequencies of that
radiation.  This frequency  is a slightly different term than that used to
describe molecular activity.  The frequency  used to measure color is based on
the fact that color is a radiation or energy.  Light is  separated into seven
basic frequencies.  These frequencies are seen as the colors red,  orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.  Red is of the lowest frequency and
violet  the highest. Here you have looked at the physical definitions of light
and color.  How,  though, can light and color be of benefit to the well-being
of your physical body?

You are familiar with how colors can effect one's mood.  A blue room for
example can  give one a feeling of peace and relaxation while a red room would
tend to make one feel  energetic or even nervous.  But few of us are aware of
how colors can effect the physical  body directly.  The entire principle
behind color healing is vibration.  Every part of your  body vibrates at a
particular frequency.  Disease is the result when any part of the body
develops disharmony or the wrong frequency.  Color radiation when directed at
the  particular area of imbalance, induces a sympathetic vibration into that
organ and corrects  the frequency of the organ back to its original frequency,
and thus, good health.  How can  this be done?

Before explaining this procedure its best to give this WARNING!!! Do not go
out based on  these teachings and setup a healing practice!  If you are not a
doctor, are you really sure  of what is wrong with the person?  You could be
sued if you end up hurting someone.  As  you progress magickally, you will
know through your Oversoul what is wrong with the  person and what color to
use.  Use this science to help only those to whom you are close  to and on
yourself.  Be absolutely sure of what you are doing.  If you have any doubts,
DON'T DO IT!   This is a great healing science if used wisely.  Be careful.
There are  several methods to induce color healing. No discussion will be made
here of the use of  color lamps for they will be replaced soon with a more
advanced machine.  What will be  discussed is the use of color meditation and
your own physical instrument, the body.

You are a channel for the higher energies.  You are a magnet for these
energies and by concentrating or meditating on the specific color necessary to
be applied you will  magnetize them to you and then be able to apply them to
the one needing healing.   Before discussing the actual procedure you must
prepare yourself as you did in  meditation.  Be sure you are in good health or
you could induce your illness into the one  your healing.  When you enter into
meditation it would be good to get a sheet of paper  with the color you wish
to magnetize and gaze on it.  As your meditation proceeds be sure  your ankles
and hands are crossed.  This conserves the energy you are magnetizing.
Visualize this color energy filling your Night Pillar. See the Pillar becoming
filled with the  color until it can hold no more.  Then you are ready to pass
it to the one in need of  healing.  If you are the one who needs healing see
that energy penetrating the area in  poor health.  See that part of the body
becoming whole and perfect. If it is another person  or anything needing the
color energy place your hands on the area that is ill. Again see  that energy
penetrating into that part and restoring it to perfect harmony and vibration.
You do not necessarily have to be present to administer the healing energy.
If the person  is somewhere else see your energy moving to that person.
Visualize that person and the area of illness and again see the energy making
all whole and perfect.  Be sure when you  are finished that you wash your
hands in cold running water.  It will be necessary to  continue the number of
treatments once every hour until the condition is relieved.  You  should apply
the healing for a period lasting fifteen minutes.  These continuous
treatments are necessary so that you are working in harmony with the cyclic
nature of the  body.  This time period allows the body adequate time to use
the energy being supplied  to it.  Also it allows you to know when to stop
treatment, for sometime in the forty-five  minute period, you can observe the
healing process and its progress.  The last subject to  discuss is the colors
themselves and what ailments they cure.  You will begin with the  lowest
frequency of color, red.

Red is vibrant and alive.  Red is a heating, vitalizing, and stimulating
color.  It is directly responsible for your physical vitality.  In cases where
there is a lack of energy red is an exceptional color.  It is effective in the
treatment of anemia and cancer.  It vitalizes the  blood and helps to purify
it.  Do not use this color when there is an inflammatory condition  present or
when the person is of excitable temperament.

The color orange has often been associated with the Sun.  It is necessary for
health and vitality.  It influences primarily the processes of assimilation
and circulation.  The color helps to regulate the intake of food and is
centered around the spleen. It is good for the treatment of asthma,
bronchitis, colds, and epilepsy.  It is further useful for the treatment  of
gout, inflammation of the kidneys, gall stones, cessation of menstruation, and
mental debility.

The color yellow acts as a tonic on the nerves.  It is an inspiring and
mentally stimulating color.  It is good for the treatment of dyspepsia,
diabetes, flatulence, and constipation.  Clear golden yellow is one of the
most powerful forces against depression and limitations  of every kind.
Yellow stimulates the brain as well as exerting great therapeutic influence
on the assimilative organs of the body.  Yellow also stimulates the purifying
action in the  body for it effects the liver, gall bladder, and intestines in
stimulating them and aiding in  the elimination of the body wastes.  Yellow
improves the texture of the skin, heals scars,  and heals other blemishes.

Green is the color of the Earth.  It is the color of harmony and balance.  It
has a soothing  effect upon the nerves.  It has a very powerful effect on the
blood supply and its  distribution throughout the body.  Green is an excellent
tranquilizer and is further  beneficial in the treatment of heart complaints,
blood pressure, and headaches.   Blue is the color of deep peace and harmony.
It acts upon the body as a powerful  antiseptic.  It is excellent in the
treatment of insomnia.  Blue is good in the treatment of  all throat diseases
and in the treatment of gall bladder attacks, jaundice, skin abrasions,  cuts,
burns, and rheumatism.

Indigo is the Healer for the eyes, ears, and nose.  It is excellent in the
treatment of  deafness, cataract, delirium tremens, and eye inflammation.  It
is good in the treatment of  lung disorders, pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis,
and indigestion.

Violet is the highest vibration of visible light.  Its effect is primarily in
the area of the brain.   It is good in the treatment of mental disorders,
cataracts, and paralysis.  Creative artist  and workers would benefit by
surrounding their room with objects of this color and  meditating and storing
this color.  It is excellent in the treatment of insomnia.

In closing, again use the colors carefully.  Do not use them excessively.  At
all times, you  should seek the guidance of your Oversoul.  Never prescribe
treatment to anyone.  And  above all, in the case of illness Consult your
Physician!  You can use this science to aid  your healing and that of others,
but it is not meant to replace the therapeutic care given by  your Physician.
I have made a small beginning in discussing the realm of vibration.  I  spoke
of the vibrating world around us and how all life is in constant motion.  I
discussed  the special world of light and colors and their relationship to the
human body.  In the next  topic you are going to explore some fascinating
information concerning the human body  and how it works.

17.  Night Centers and the Physical and Etheric Bodies    

In the Eastern languages the Night Centers are known as chakras. Night Centers
are  located in each type of body that you have, from the Etheric to the
Mental Body.  They are,  in appearance, small whirlpool-like vortices of
concentrated energy.  The Night Centers  are responsible for a number of
functions.  They are conveyors of the Night Force from  higher dimensions to
the lower ones.  They act as step-down transformers taking the  higher energy
and lowering it to meet the requirements of each body. They further  function
as message centers.  They connect each dimension from the higher ones to the
lower with an internal form of communication keeping your entire system of
bodies in  rapport with each other.  They have other functions but these will
be covered in later  topics.  You are presently going to look at two bodies,
the physical and Etheric, and the  role of the Night Centers to each.  Let's
look at the physical body first.

In the physical body there is a corresponding organ and/or gland to each of
the Night  Centers. The lowest of the centers is at the base of the spine and
relates to the gonads.   The second of these centers is located over the area
of the spleen and is associated with  the spleen/pancreas. The third Night
Center is located over the navel area or the solar  plexus and corresponds to
the adrenal glands.  The fourth is located over the heart region  and relates
to the thymus gland. The fifth is located in the throat area and relates to
the  thyroid gland.  The sixth Night Center is located in the brow area and
relates to the pineal  gland.  The seventh Night Center is located at the top
or crown of the head and is  associated with the pituitary gland. What is
interesting and important to observe is that  the organs make up the
endocrine system.

These glands produce a substance called hormone which is spilled into the
blood stream  to regulate every cell in the body.  These glands further effect
the growth and  development of the physical body; the way you feel; and even
the way you think.  The  endocrine system is regulated by the nervous system.
Here there is an important parallel.   For every Night Center there is a nerve
center that corresponds to it too.  These nerve  centers are closely related
to the glands they regulate, which are those of the endocrine  system.  This
leads us to the Night Centers, Etheric Body, and their relationship to your
bodily control.

The Etheric Body is produced by the electromagnetic energy generated by the
physical  body. The Etheric is an exact counterpart to the physical body.  The
Etheric Body  interpenetrates the physical body and extends from a half inch
to four inches around the  physical body and can be seen by the Night Eye as a
whitish blue light.  The Etheric Body  is the lowest body where the Night
Centers can be found.  The Oversoul influences the  body through the
transmission of Night Force through the Higher Night Centers which  continues
to be stepped down till the energies enter the Etheric vortices which in turn
affects the nerve centers, endocrine system, and the body overall.  They are
all  interrelated.  The two Night Centers which directly effect the well-being
of the physical  body are the lowest two.

The lowest center found at the base of the spine contains the Earth Fire.  In
the Eastern religions it is called Kundalini.  I will discuss this Energy in a
later topic but for now I will discuss the intake of Earth Force, a less
concentrated form of the Earth Fire.  Those who  have ever lived in a
high-rise apartments and worked in similar offices may recall feeling  very
tired and run down.  This is due to lack of direct contact with the Earth.  It
is essential  for humans to remain in contact with the Earth.  When the body
makes direct contact with  the Earth, the base Night Center is then able to
absorb the Earth's energy. Everyone  should take time to get outdoors in
direct contact with Mother Earth and absorb that vital  energy.  In a later
topic, I will present a rite to help keep the Earth energies high in
yourself.  The second Night Center concerned with your well-being is located
over the  spleen/pancreas and absorbs the pranic force generated by the Sun.
This is the second energy necessary for the well-being of your physical body.
An  adequate intake of this energy will give you good health.  It will give
you vitality, youth,  and a zest for life.    As was mentioned earlier, the
Etheric extends beyond and around the  outline of the body approximately a
half to four inches.  It is bluish grey to bluish white in  color.  When a
person is in good health the Etheric will be strong in appearance and  extend
several inches beyond the outline of the body.  In poor health or when one is
low  in energy the Etheric will be close to the body and hard to see.  How do
you see the  Etheric?

Etheric sight is the best way to begin to see magickally.  Since this energy
is of lesser  vibration then that of auric energy it will be easier to see
with the Night Eye.  For a  moment, let's discuss exactly what is the Night
Eye and then the mechanics of how it  operates.

The Night Eye and its existence have been known since the time of the Ancient
Ones.  In  the Eastern languages it's referred to as the "Third Eye" .  The
Night Eye is a magickal  organ that when activated allows you to see the
higher dimensions.  The Night Eye is also  capable of enlarging microscopic
particles till you can see them.  This is very similar to  the microscope and
its function.  For most, the Night Eye is closed and blind to the higher
realm, but through the techniques and practices in this work you will learn to
use and see  through the Night Eye. The mechanics of the Night Eye will be
discussed in greater depth  in a later topic.  For now, the Night Eye is
related to the sixth Night Center and the pineal  gland.  When they are
functioning under your voluntary control then you are able to see  magickally.
Knowledge of the exact mechanics is not necessary in order for you to see
through the Night Eye.  What is necessary is knowing the techniques for
opening and  using the Night Eye and then plenty of practice. Therefore, let's
perform some exercises  to begin its development.

To convince yourself more fully that there really is an Etheric Body begin
with the  following experiment.  One night as you are in bed, lie on your back
with your feet spread  apart.  Then slowly bring your feet together until you
can feel them touch each other.   When you feel them just touch try and see if
you can put them together any closer.  You  will be surprised to find that you
can.  This distance is the area occupied by the Etheric.   You can also do
this with another person.  Try touching the other person on an area of  bare
skin.  The neck and head area is the best.  Touch them with one finger very
lightly  and then slowly remove the finger to about one inch away.  The person
will not be able to  tell the difference when you are touching and when you
are not.   Now that you are more  fully convinced that there is an Etheric,
let's move on and see it.

It will be easier if you get another person to help you.  Have that person
stand against a  neutral background, the best color is white, and have them
relax and breathe deeply.  The  lighting is very important.  The light should
be behind you and positioned such that it will  not produce a shadow on the
subject.  The lighting should be dim.  You should now  position yourself away
from the subject about six to ten feet and sit or stand in a  comfortable
position.  Relax and breathe deeply.  Look at the subject and let your eyes
relax.  Do not concentrate on seeing anything.  Look beyond the subject as if
looking off  into the distance.  The subject's Etheric Energy will extend
around the outline of the  physical body.  If you are alone you can still
practice seeing the Etheric.

Have a mirror positioned in front of you such that you can see the upper body
outline.   Have behind you a background of neutral color.  Do the same as
outlined above as if you  had someone before you.  In all the work, outlined
above, do not become discouraged if  results do not occur the first time.  Be
patient and know that all is, and will, work for you if  you but try. No one
can become a Master Night Magician without great practice and  perseverance.
So you, too, can be a Master of Night Magick if you will but practice and
persevere.  You leave the Realm of the Etheric and Magickal Sight to enter
into the Realm  of Magickal Sound.

18.  The Power of Sound    

Ever see an opera singer shatter a crystal glass?  It is said that words are
things and once spoken may cause the very thing to happen.  Can there really
be so much to the spoken  word? Let's explore the physical properties of the
spoken word, or in other words, sound  and its properties and discover the
secret.

You first must learn that sound is caused by vibrating structures.  That for
sound to travel  it must move through a material substance or medium.  Sound
travels as a wave motion.  As a sound wave travels, in a medium, small
displacements occur to the molecules in that  medium or substance.  These
small displacements are a regular collective motion in  which all the
molecules, in a small volume of matter, move together.  Think of this motion
as compared to a small volume of water held by a container in which you would
see a  wave moving in the volume of water.  This ordered wave motion is
superimposed on the  random thermal agitation or vibration of the molecules.
We, therefore, look at sound  waves as the molecules of the substance jiggling
back and forth in a regular fashion.  You  know that sound is the result of
vibrating bodies but beyond this you must know that a  traveling sound wave
transports energy.

When this sound wave is incident on, or striking, a body of matter there is
absorption of  that sound wave's energy by that body.  In some cases this will
force the body to vibrate at  the frequency of the incident wave.  A state of
resonance will occur when the vibration of  the body and that of the incident
wave are close in natural frequency.  Sound can do some  phenomenal things.
For example, remember the high pitched note of the singer, when it  is
incident upon the crystal glass, causes it to break.  But even greater is the
Power of the  spoken word or sound energy, when that energy is transmitted on
the carrier wave of  creative magickal thought.  The spoken word is endowed
with the Night Force when the  creative thought behind that word is that of
Night Consciousness.  Your words are  endowed with Night Force when your
Magickal Consciousness is that of the Oversoul.   Your words are as potent as
your consciousness is equal to that of Night Consciousness.   For your words
to be life and accomplish that where they are sent, then your  consciousness
must be that of the Oversoul.  Your will is the selector of the words, but for
them to be more then mere words they must be endowed with Night Force through
Night  Consciousness.  Let's try it.

To begin with first see yourself as the Oversoul.  Feel the Night Presence of
your own  Oversoul selecting the words with which you wish to create with.
Then speak the words  knowing that it is not you that says the words, but that
it is the Oversoul who says the  Words.  Then those Words will go forth and do
as they are sent forth to do.  The greater  your attunement with your
Oversoul, the greater will be the potency of the Words.  Keep  your thoughts
in tune with your Oversoul at all times.  For your words to take on the Night
Force you must become the Oversoul in all you do. Repeat the Words over and
over again  till you can feel the words take on a life of their own.  Repeat
them till your words are  endowed with Night Force then they will go forth and
create as you have said.  There are  no limitations to what your Words in
Night Consciousness may do.  They can bring to you  your heart's desire.  They
can literally move mountains.  They can create life.  There are  no
limitations to what you can do, so long as it is in accord with your Oversoul.
As you are  filled with the Sound of the Oversoul, now to fill yourself with
the Energies of the Earth.

19.  Earth Rite  

Your body is very much like that of the Earth.  As was shown in an earlier
topic, the body  has interspaced in it an Etheric Body. This is your magnetic
field just as the Earth has a  magnetic field.  It is essential to your good
health to be in contact with the Earth.  The  Earth currents mixed with your
own magnetic currents keep you in good health.  You will  experience less
tension and frustration.  If you can do nothing else you should get out into
the country and go barefoot.  Here though, I would like to introduce a rite
which will allow  you to absorb a great deal more Earth Energy.

The Earth's energy is of the highest order.  You may feel that the Earth is an
unclean  place and that its energies are of the same order.  This is not true!
Man's attitude is the  harmful energy which is slowly destroying the Earth
itself.  From the Oversoul's viewpoint  the Earth is covered in a dense
blanket of Man's wrongful attitude concerning the Earth.   The Earth is the
Body of a magickally advanced Being and Its Energies are of the deepest
order.  Let's look specifically at how to absorb these life giving energies.

The only place to do this rite is outdoors.  You should select a place which
is free of  Man's urbanization.  Go out into a park or a private woods.  Go
somewhere so that you  won't be disturbed. Once you have selected a place that
feels right sit down and get  comfortable.  Your bottom should be in direct
contact with the Earth.  Do not sit in a chair.   Next begin with deep
breathing, relax, and let all tension go.  When you are perfectly  relaxed
begin to feel your own Etheric Body.  Feel your magnetic current touching the
magnetic current of the Earth.  When you breathe in, you will draw the Earth
Energy up  into your body via the Night Centers.  See this energy flowing up
through the base center  and flow on higher and higher through each center
until it reaches the crown center.   When it has reached this far, hold the
energy there and allow it to penetrate your entire  being.    Then, as you
exhale, see the tired and tense energies of your own body flow  back out of
your body and being absorbed by the Earth.  The Earth will change and  charge
these energies with Earth Force. Continue this exercise as long as you feel
comfortable.  During this exercise you should feel a communion and Oneness
with the Soul of the Earth.  The Earth is a Magickal Fountain of the Darkest
Night.  Drink from it  and be renewed!

You have traveled far on the Earth Road.  You have learned a great deal about
yourself.   You have come to know the hidden faculties and powers that lie
within you.  But as all  things on Earth must end so in the next topic, you
will come to know your own ending and  this chapter on Earth Magick.

20.  The Physical Realm of Death    

It has always been said that people fear the unknown.  One of the greatest
unknowns in  life is death.   Dying is as important as living on Earth.  Dying
does not have to be a big  unknown. There does not have to be fear of death.
To end the fear of dying one must  look at death and understand it.

Your life is sustained only so long as the silver cord is attached to your
physical body.   This is your lifeline from your Oversoul to that which you
know as "I".  In the actual  physical process of dying it takes three complete
days for this cord to separate.  The body  should be left alone and
undisturbed as much as possible till then.  As you are  separating, you feel
like a cloud drifting over your physical body.  After three days, you  will
cast off like a ship adrift on the seas.  The process of dying is entirely
painless and  you should have no fear.  Before casting off for the next
dimension, you are required to  view the actual process of the preparation of
your body for burial.  This is to convince you  that your physical body has
actually died, but that you still live.  Here, it might be  appropriate to say
something about those who are left behind.

In the west, you have been taught that you should grieve for the one who has
departed.  It  would be more appropriate to celebrate for they now have left
this world for a new world  of happiness and joy.  In this new world there is
no suffering, hunger, or struggle for  survival.  You grieve over another's
dying for many reasons, but mostly at the loss you  feel and at being alone.
How can you overcome this grief?

First, you should realize that you will someday be reunited with them if you
wish.  Only  those in harmony with each other can reunite, for only harmony
can exist on the other  side.  You should also realize that you should not
grieve so much for the one gone, for  you tend to disturb their rest and
recuperation on the other side.  What can you do to help  the person who is
suffering from grief?

The best help you can provide is to be the "listening ear".  You should do
everything in  your power to help the person talk out their grief.  Let them
talk to you about the sorrow  they feel over their loss and talk about how it
was in the past.  Keep them company and  let them cry all they want.  Crying
and tears are the greatest safety valve the human body  has.  This prevents an
emotional overload causing perhaps insanity.  Allow the person a  reasonable
time to express their grief.  But this should not go on for ever and ever.
Grief  can not be allowed to go too far. It will cause the person to develop
self-pity and this is  just as bad.  Dying to this world is birth to the next
and higher world.  There is a practice which will assist you in the process of
dying.  You should prepare  yourself through meditation.  Meditate on the
subject of death as has been described  here.  See yourself at the time of
dying.  Feel and know yourself developing as a cloud of  consciousness over
the physical body.  See yourself actually trying to get out of that old  dying
house.  Then you should see and visualize the person you want to come help you
and meet you.  Feel their presence very strong and know that they are there to
help you  make the transition.  If you have no one special to come get you,
know that there are  special helpers waiting to assist you into the next
dimension.  Have no fear for you are  never alone.  Know that just as soon as
there is complete separation of the silver cord  from the physical body that
they will assist you to the next realm.  Then allow yourself to  relax and
wait out the physical process of dying.  There is no pain nor fear to
experience,  only the beginning of a new day in a new world.  The only thing
you will experience is the  feeling of going home.   This simple process of
meditating on the transition from one  world to the next can relieve much
anxiety and worry when the actual time seems near.   There is no way that
meditating on death can bring about the actual thing.  Only the  Oversoul
knows the time of transition and can cause it to happen.  So rest assured,
that in  dying from the physical world, the process is simple, easy, and
merely a phase of  transition necessary to enter the next world beyond.  Now
you must also make the  transition from one chapter in Night Magick to the
next.

You must leave behind the Earth Realm and enter the Water Realm. You have seen
many wonders in the Earth Realm.  You have learned better ways of breathing
and things about  your body you may have never known about.  You are opening
your Night Eye by learning  about and seeing your Etheric Body.  You should be
acquiring better health and a  sounder mind through meditation and the use of
colors.  I must emphasize here, before  leaving Earth Magick, that no matter
how far you go do not stop practicing the techniques,  rites, and exercises
learned early in this book. Always take time to meditate and practice  Night
Breathing.  All the things you have learned, so far, are essential for your
success  later on.  If you are ready to explore a fascinating realm and
discover many new wonders,  then let's enter into the exciting Realm of Water
Magick.

CHAPTER V


WATER MAGICK

21.  The Water (Astral) Realm 

Here you will enter a land of great beauty.  A land of Harmony and Peace.  In
the last  topic, you had just left your dying body, the silver cord had
separated, and you were set  off adrift.  At this point, it is essential that
you believe that there is continuity in life after  physical death, otherwise
you will simply drift in a dense, dark fog, until slowly you  realize, that
you are still conscious and alive.  As soon as doubt is gone, the clouds will
dissipate and your loved ones will be there to help you.

In the first stage of transition, you will be allowed time to recuperate.  The
process of  living on Earth and the troubles of the long years spent there
have made you very weary.   In the new realm that you have just entered, you
are given time to rest from your journey  on Earth and to adjust to the Astral
Realm. Everyone, no matter what their magickal  attainment, must enter this
level of the Astral Realm.  It has been referred to, by some  religions, as
purgatory.   You are here in order to rest, purify yourself of human dross and
make decisions about your magickal future.  Your magickal development
determines the  level of purgatory you first arrive at.

For souls who are of the lowest and crudest of development, there is a very
low vibrational level for them.  At this level, acts of the worst kind, akin
to their own vibrations, are  portrayed before them.  The things that they did
wrong on Earth are done to them.  This is  a very dense region.  This is not a
land of punishment and torture, but a place to show the  individual the folly
of such a life and a place to rid the soul of its denser energies.  This is
not Hell.  There is no such place as Hell.  If Hell is anywhere it is right
here on Earth.  It is  what humankind has made of the Earth.

Above this there is the next level which some go immediately to and some come
up to  from a lower level.   This level is for souls who allowed their lower
passions to rule them.   For those who sought after money and power without
maintaining the Eternal Night  Balance.  This region is very much akin to the
physical plane just left behind.  The Astral  surroundings will be very
similar to those of the Earth.  Here the souls will remain, till they  rid
themselves of the courser Astral material, so that they may go ever higher.
They rid  themselves of this dense Astral material by learning control of
their passions.  They must  make up the Eternal Balance.  From here we go to
the level you probably rose to from the  beginning.

You rise to the level where generally all begin who are of a basically good
nature.  This  land is filled with beautiful parks and lakes.  There are very
beautiful buildings all around  you.  There are colors never before seen by
you.  The air is alive with energy and life.   Animal life is abundant and
tame.  There is beautiful music everywhere in the air.  Here in  this realm no
disharmony can occur.  No one can meet anyone who would cause them
unhappiness of any kind.  When you first arrive, your loved ones or magickal
helpers will  be there to assist you.  In this realm, all that you want is
produced by your thoughts.   Travel is by thought.  If you want to wear
clothes then you must think of yourself dressed  as you want to be dressed.
Your nourishment is all around you.  All you have to do is  breathe.  Your
physical habits that you learned on Earth will still be with you.  You may
feel that you still have to eat.  This is fine. You need only think of the
food you want to eat  plus the table and so forth necessary to eat it with.
But the sooner you learn to forget the  old physical habits, and learn and
experience your new Astral Body, the sooner you will  be able to progress.
This is a very real world.  This world is as solid and real to its
inhabitants as your own Earth is to you.  But there are some who see this
realm slightly  different.

For some souls who believe in an exact type of heaven according to their
religious beliefs,  or even of the opposite region, and feel that this is
where they are going, then this is what  they will see.  If they believe that
they will see the Pearly Gates and St. Pete at them, then  this is what they
will see.  Gradually though, imperfections will show up here and there.   The
gates may squeak or even fall off the hinges as they start to open.  The
angels, flying  about, may suddenly be wearing flannel shirts and play off-key
on their rusty harps.   When the person has enough doubts about their
make-believe heaven, then like a dream,  it will disappear and the real Astral
Realm will appear and so their beloved ones too.

It is best to keep an open mind when you make the transition. This will
quicken your entry into your new realm and life.  After you have become
adjusted to this new realm, you will  be escorted to a building where you will
review your recent life and past lives you have  lived.  All that you have
ever done will be shown to you on what has been called in some  religions the
Akashic Record, and by others, the Book of Records.  Let's look at this
Record and see what it is?

The Night Record, as you will come to know it, is a special energy upon which
everything  that has ever occurred to anyone and anything is recorded.  There
is further shown, on the  Night Record, the probabilities for the future.
This Record not only can show what has  occurred on the Earth, but for
anyplace located anywhere.  This Record can be seen by   those who have made
the Earth transition in order to look at their life just lived, and by  those
of high magickal development who have a need to see. The Record is not for the
use of just anyone.

So, you were just entering the Night Record Hall and preparing to review your
life.  You  see the things you did and the things you shouldn't have done.
You see the things you  were supposed to have done and learned.  No one judges
you but yourself and your  Oversoul!   You are your own sternest judge.  It is
through your Oversoul that you see  where you have gone wrong and what your
Oversoul wanted you to accomplish in your  life.  You are then led out of the
Hall by your guide and taken to a council of advisors.  These advisors are
trained to aid you in reviewing your lives and determining the best  means for
accomplishing the previous desired results wanted by your Oversoul and thus
planning your future. You are placed in the proper circumstances, at the
proper time, to  achieve the desired results.  After this planning, you will
retire to the Astral Realm of your  vibration and rest and prepare yourself
for the next phase of life.

You are responsible for all that you do in life.  You are responsible for the
debts you  occur in life and for repaying your debts.  No one will pay your
debts except you.  The bad  and good you create is called Karma.  Karma and
the Astral Realm are deeply related.  It  is at this plane of life that you
make decisions which will effect your future.  Until you  learn the lessons
necessary to be learned on the Earth plane then you must continue to  return
until you have learned all there is to be learned.  Who determines when you
have  learned all that there is to be learned?  The Oversoul is who!

In a Process not described here, your future is woven out of your magickal
essence in the  Astral Realm.  This magickal fabric that is being woven
contains the basic kinds of  programs.  By programs, I am referring to
programs very similar to that used by the  computer so that it can carry out
its basic functions.  One of your inner programs sets for  you predetermined
events which you must experience.  These events are the results of  energies
you have set into motion from out of the past which must be again experienced
and worked through.  Further, they can be events, not necessarily a result of
your past but  of events which you need to experience to make you stronger and
a better instrument for  your Oversoul.  The second program is for you to
make.

These are periods which allow you to determine the path you will choose.  They
are like a blank tape upon which you write your future.  You know when you
have entered these  periods for you feel like a ship adrift on the seas.  All
the familiar surroundings,  experiences, and securities in your life are gone.
They are not easy times for you, but  they are the greatest periods for your
soul growth.  They bring to you periods of inner  growth, new directions in
your life, and a chance to accelerate your magickal growth.  In  these
periods, you are the Captain of your Destiny.  By the choices you make and the
opportunities you take to advance, your future is set in motion.  These
periods allow you  to clear up excess karmic debt.  They will bring to you new
friends, teachers, and many  changes which if taken advantaged of, will allow
you to achieve great magickal growth.   You must watch for these periods and
take all the advantage of them you can.  You have  to be tough.  They will
test the very essence of that which you are made of.  You must do  the very
best you can in all that you do.  You must be strong and know that you are
guided.  You never fail in life if you can say that you did your best.  You
can gain these learning experiences in the Astral Realm just as you can learn
them on Earth.  So why  would you want to leave the Astral world.

In the Astral, life is full of harmony and beauty.  It would take a long time
to learn even the easiest of lessons.  So, in order for the Oversoul to grow
at a fast rate, it chooses to send  a part of itself, being you, to learn
quickly in the "School of Hard Knocks".  You know that  you grow fastest when
you have to learn the hard way.  You learn your lessons quickly  and well.  If
life was all fun and games you would never learn, so life is not easy.  There
are some lessons that can only be learned on Earth. A hard life may not
necessarily be a  sign of large karmic debt, but a period of quick growth and
possible advancement.  How  many lifetimes does it take before you don't have
to come back here anymore?

No one can really say how many lives it will take except your Oversoul.  There
is only so  much that can be learned from each sojourn on Earth.  There are so
many things that  must be learned from living on Earth.  You keep coming here
to the Earth until you have  learned all the lessons necessary and until the
Oversoul is in charge of your life.  Each of  your lives adds to the Eternal
Essence which is your Oversoul.  Yet this idea of  reincarnation or the
returning to life on Earth time and time again scares many.

They don't like reincarnation because they are afraid that they will lose
their individuality. Well, you never lose that individuality.  Your Oversoul
can be compared to a vessel of  water.  In that vessel of water, if you add
some red dye the water will appear red add the  color yellow and you will have
orange.  Each color is still there but their added essence  creates a new
whole. Thus you add each individuality into the Oversoul.  The Oversoul  grows
and becomes more then it just was by that new addition.  You are still that
individuality but you are in cooperative union with all the other parts which
make up the  sum, which is the Oversoul. When you have learned all that must
be learned, then you no  longer have to return to the Earth. You then pass
beyond the Astral World when you have  learned all that you have to learn
there. There are many things to learn in the Astral.

There is the special group that is responsible for the souls making the
transition from the Earth to the Astral.  There are those who weave the soul
fabric for a soul's journey to  Earth. There are also teachers, doctors,
nurses, advisors, and guides to those still living  on Earth. You can, after
gaining all that you must learn in the Astral, die or leave this  dimension
and go on to an even higher realm.  You could also go on to a more advanced
planet and civilization and begin the cycle of life and death there.  The
variables are  endless and the choice of your Oversoul.  I have referred to
the Astral Realm as the Water  Realm.  In Night Magick, the things you will
learn of this realm are known as Water  Magick.

From the beginning, the Ancients have likened the Astral Realm to water
because things  of the Astral involve the emotions.  The Astral Body is the
body of emotions.  You feel and  express emotions because you have an Astral
Body.  It is the purpose of Water Magick to  help you gain control over, and
to refine, your Astral Body.  The instruction, exercises, and  rites are
presented here to accomplish this purpose.  This is the hardest body to gain
control over.  The emotions in most people run wild and out-of-control.
People give into  their emotions without trying to gain any self-control.  You
have to learn to control your  emotions in order to have magickal growth.  You
must make the Astral Body an  instrument worthy of the Oversoul.  It must
become an Instrument through which the  Oversoul pours out Its Night Energies
into the world.  You must strive at all times to be  consciously aware that as
you feel and express emotions that actually it is the Oversoul  who feels and
expresses through you. That control over your emotions and the expression  of
Night Force comes only through constant communion with your Oversoul.  Strive
for this  communion at all times.  You are the Oversoul in emotional
expression here on Earth.   Through the Oversoul you will succeed.  Let's
begin immediately learning exercises for  emotional control and magickal
advancement.

22.  The Astral Body and Exercises for Emotional Control 

On each realm of life that the Oversoul lives on there is a necessity for a
vehicle made up  of that realm's essence in order for the Oversoul to find
expression in that realm.  The  vehicle you are most familiar with is the
physical body.  It is made up of dense physical  matter.  You know from
earlier discussions that there is a large amount of space between  all the
molecules of the physical body.  Interspaced in the physical body can be found
the  Astral molecules which make up the Astral Body.

In the Astral Realm, your Astral Body and all the Astral surroundings are as
solid and real  to you as is your physical body and surroundings, when you are
in the physical realm.   The Astral Body is much more refined, and vibrating
at a higher vibration, then is the  physical body.  The Astral Body has the
same identical form as your physical body.  When  you are in the Astral Realm
though, your Astral Body is very beautiful and without  imperfections.  There
are no signs of ageing as there are in the physical world.  The Astral  form
is very beautiful and the face is of exquisite beauty.  There is no ugliness
or lack of  harmony in the Astral.  The Astral Body exists simultaneously with
the physical body and  all other bodies as well.  While you are in the
physical body, the Astral Body is the body  through which you feel.  It is the
body through which the Oversoul impresses and  communicates with you.

At night, when you sleep, it is the body through which you experience dreams.
Dreams  are often distortions of your experiences in the Astral Realm.  The
Astral Body is the body  of emotions.  The Astral Body can be likened to an
emotion magnet. When you express  an emotion, you actually charge the
surrounding Astral material with that emotion.  You  have experienced this
happening.

For example, when you have gotten someone angry, you can actually feel the
atmosphere around that person become alive with anger. You have also seen this
when someone  expresses love for another. The Astral material which surrounds
you and the physical  world is made up of charged Astral Energy.  For the
Earth, this energy is of a dense  nature.

There are all kinds of emotional energies which make up the astral material
around the  Earth. These energies range from love to hate.  On the Earth you
can have inharmony  and discord and harmony and accord.  This is what is meant
by dense.  You can express  any emotions while on Earth.

When you express an emotion, such as hate, the energy which is of like quality
in the  Astral is attracted to you.  You can see that your hate, added to the
greater hate which is  surrounding you only makes your hatred more intense.
You can then become consumed  with hate, so much so, that you may lose control
and seriously hurt through that hate.   Long after the hate seems to have left
you, it still remains within your Astral Aura.  The  slightest thing can
trigger again this hate reaction and more hate energy will be  generated.
This is what happens from a lack of emotional control.

As I've said, the world as a whole is made up of many kinds of emotional
energies.  The  energies are there to use and express with control.  Without
control, you become a pawn  for domination by the emotional energies
surrounding you.  You must begin by learning  to refine your Astral Body.  To
learn to place it under the control of your Oversoul.  Let me  introduce some
exercises which will help you gain self-control.

Begin by deliberately slowing yourself down.  When you drive on the road
always let the  other person go first.  Slow down when you drive.  If you will
drive the speed limit, or five  miles an hour below it, you will be passed by
all.  When you walk do it slowly.  Let others  enter a building or room ahead
of yourself. The idea is to slow down.  This is the first  exercise and the
next involves your use of meditation. When you are in meditation, visualize a
cleansing energy moving through your Astral  Body and Night Centers.  See that
energy cleansing all emotional energy and replacing it  with the Night Force.
Visualize bliss, peace, and ecstasy filling your entire being.  Next,
visualize any act which you know produces an out- of-control emotional
response within  yourself.  See that event occurring and you remaining in
perfect control.  Do this with all  events and slowly you will gain control.
Learn to disassociate from an emotional world of  chaos.

The world rids itself of an over abundance of chaotic energies through natural
means.   These include such events as hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes,
floods, and violent  storms.  They are the world's safety valves when the
human emotional energies become  too much.  You can help to prevent these
occurrences by correcting your own energy  production.  In meditation, you can
visualize the entire world and do for it what you did for  yourself above.
See that cleansing energy fill the world.  See the emotional energies of
humankind balanced and in order.  If you will do this daily the world will
become a more  stable environment.  This is your first step on the Road of
Water Magick.  Your next  involves the Astral Aura and its relationship to
colors.

23.  Astral Aura, Color, and Exercises  

Around you, shaped like an egg, is the electromagnetic energy known as the
aura.  Each  body produces its own aura.  The most studied aura is the product
of the Astral Body.  I  will discuss the astral aura, its relationship to
colors, and exercises for seeing and  strengthening the aura.

The aura surrounds your body like an egg with the point at the feet.  In the
average  individual the aura extends approximately twelve to eighteen inches
around the body.  As  you develop magickally the aura enlarges.  The
electromagnetic energy is perceived by  the Night Eye as color.

In the Astral aura, these colors reflect the emotions which make up the
individual.  The  colors of the aura generally extend up to the eyes with the
halo region just beyond that.   Out of the top of the head extends a fountain
of energy in the more advanced soul.  This  halo region is the strongest
region of energy and is the easiest to see using your Night  Eye.  On the
outer fringes of the aura is the Auric Sheath.

This is a skin-like film and completely encloses the aura.  On the auric
sheath, which can  be compared to a translucent screen, the subconscious mind
projects a variety of thought pictures.  On this screen can be seen images of
thoughts and even past life images.   Before you learn to see the aura, let's
look at what the auric colors reveal about people.

To begin with, some of the colors seen reflect current emotional expression.
For  example, anger will flash into the aura as a deep, dark blackish-red.
This color will  generally last only as long as a person feels the emotion,
although residuals of this anger  will remain for sometime.  The second kind
of colors seen reflect long standing emotional  states.  You'll remember in
the last topic that the emotional energy produced by your  Astral Body was a
magnetic attracter for similar energy.

For example, if you become angry a great deal, then this energy tends to
concentrate in  your aura.  The concentration tends to increase for
surrounding anger energy is attracted  to the anger energy already in your
aura.  Thus, you will see a heavy concentration of  blackish-red in your aura
which remains there over long periods of time.   It won't  dissipate so long
as you continue to create this energy.  This applies to all kinds of
emotional energy.

There are seven basic colors in the aura.  They are red, orange, yellow,
green, blue,  indigo, and violet.  All the colors and their shades indicate a
particular emotion or  something about the character of an individual.  Take
each color and try to learn as much  about it as it pertains to people.  Some
things you will learn about colors will come from  your experiences over the
years.  Colors can first be broken down into two main groups.   The red,
orange, yellow group are full of energy.  They represent people who are
vibrant.   These are people who are extroverts. They are the worlds'
socialites.  The second group,  green, blue, indigo, and violet are the
introverts.  These are the quiet, less social people.   They are more
concerned with their interests then those of the world.

The color red rules the physical world.  It is the color of Earth's fertility.
It is the color of activity and creativeness. When seen as a clear, bright red
in the aura it signifies people  who possesses the attributes of ambition,
leadership, sociability, and strong character.  It  indicates force, vigor,
and vitality in people.  They will have a strong sex drive.  They will  be
pioneers. They will love adventure and have a great need for new friends and
new  things.  These are very aggressive people.  This does lead to some
problems.

Red makes people very impulsive.  They are apt to be abrupt and impatient in
all things.   They are very earthy in their ways. This is the person with
clear, bright red in their aura.   But there are many modifications to the
color red that can be see in the aura.  Dark red  indicates a deep passion or
emotion within. A person who is sometimes domineering and  brash.  A light red
indicates irritability, nervousness, and one who is excitable.  A bright  red
flashing on a black background indicates extreme anger arising from hatred and
malice.  A brick red is for conceit and reddish brown is for deceit.  A dark
scarlet is for the  strongest, sensual love.  A coral color pink is for
immaturity in teenagers; childishness  and insecurity in adults.  A clear,
rose pink is for a friendly, selfless loving person.  The  people who have red
in the best and clearest colors are leaders of the world.  They are
one-pointed, high spirited, and seek after what they want on their high
driving force.   These are people of high energy and a color you could use
some of in your aura.  This is  the color of creation.

The color orange is related in some ways to the color red.  The color orange
is formed by  the blending of the red and yellow colors.  It is the color of
vitality.  When this color is  found in the aura it indicates people who are
in good health and full of vitality.  Orange  indicates that they are
considerate towards others.  They are the humanitarian.  It can  further
indicate people who are creative, even to the extent of genius.  This is a
social  person.  Again, you see the red nature of this color. These are people
who like to get  along with others and be liked in return. They like to lead
an adventurous life.  They look  for events in their lives which offer
excitement.  They are lovers of freedom and look  forward to all that is new.
Shades of orange represent many things.

A dark orange indicates one full of self-pride.  A brownish orange represents
one who is  lazy. It could also indicate someone who is subject to kidney
trouble.  If muddy and  cloudy orange is present in the aura it indicates a
person of low intellect.  But yellowish  golden orange in the aura shows
self-control and efficiency in all things.  I have indicated  what orange can
mean when seen in the aura.  Let's go a bit further and see what orange
induced into your aura through meditation can do for you.

The color orange is a color which can induce change into your system.  It is
an energy for dealing with problems which can be changed to a more positive
situation.  For example,  let's say you have an inferiority problem.  You
always feel unmatched towards any  problem.  You perhaps have a low opinion of
yourself and never feel able to deal with life.   The orange light can change
this attitude.  It can make you feel free of limitations.  It will  add zest
and optimism in your life.  Orange helps to induce change into your thinking
processes so that you can assimilate new ideas.  It also induces stability in
your thinking.   As you will recall, orange is made up of two colors.  The
first was red and the second is  yellow.

Yellow is the color of the mind.  It signifies all there is in relation to
intelligence.  In the  aura, a bright, clear yellow represents good mental
capabilities.  This color is very  prominent in the halo region.  An excess of
this color denotes people who spend almost  all their time after mental
pursuits. These people have very quick minds.  They are able to  realize their
mental capabilities.  They have a desire to help other people through the
products of their mental abilities.  They do tend to be shy and slightly
introverted.  They  control their anger easily. They are the concrete thinker.
They deal in hard physical  realities.  This is a good color for scientists
and professors.  If the colors are of a softer,  paler shades, then this is
good for the writer, artist, and all creative workers. Diffused  yellow, in
the aura, indicates people who are tactful, cheerful, and use discrimination
in  all they do.  They do not worry about mundane things.  They are generally
happy, friendly,  and helpful to others.  If the yellow is muddy, mustard
yellow it shows craftiness.  A  grayish cast to the yellow shows mental
cunning.  A greenish yellow aura it indicates  jealousy.  Pinkish yellow shows
astuteness in people.  A dingy yellow shows cowardice  and reddish yellow
shows mental, moral, and physical timidity.  Yellow induced into the  physical
body leads to the regeneration of the human cells keeping the body in beauty
and health.  Yellow effects the Astral Body by inducing a state of emotional
well-being.  It  further helps the mental capabilities by sharpening them and
improving the memory.  It  will make the mind quicker and able to more easily
assimilate new material. Yellow  qualities help to produce the next color.

Green is the color of Earth.  It is the garment that clothes the Goddess/God
of Earth.  This  is the color which symbolizes balance, harmony, and
abundance.  In the Night World, this  is the color of balance and harmony.  In
the physical world, it is the color of success and  prosperity. If this color
is a pure, emerald green, with just a touch of blue, it is the color of
healing.  This color can be found in the aura of doctors and nurses.  Green is
also found  in the auras of teachers.  Green in the aura generally indicates
people of peace and  harmony. They are the good neighbor and active in all
community projects. They are  people who have a strong inner faith in
themselves and humankind.  It is a color  representing generosity and sympathy
towards all of humankind.  If there is a light green  present it shows
prosperity and success.  A middle green denotes adaptability and  versatility.
An excess of green indicates people who are very individualistic and
independent.  Clear green denotes sympathy and dark green indicates deceit.
Olive  green shows treachery and a double nature.  Next we have blue.

Blue is the color of the Sky World.  This is the  color denoting peace and
calm.  In the  aura, the deeper the shade of blue the deeper the nature of the
individual.  Blue is a good  color regardless of its darkness.  Pale blue is
an indication of people who are trying to  grow emotionally.   They may be
struggling with who they are and what they should do in  life.  As the blue
deepens so does their emotional maturity.  They are closer to knowing  who
they are.  They are closer to seeing the true purpose of their life.  They are
people  who are more dedicated and work harder in life.  The deep shades of
blue indicate people  who have found their quest.

They are people actively involved in their quest.  They know their purpose in
life and  actively seek to complete it.  They are totally immersed in the
magickal quest.  People  with blue predominate in their auras are generally
very calm individuals. They seek the  contemplative life and friends of like
nature. They are not akin to the social set.  They can  be very temperamental
when their calm is disrupted.  They are easy people to get along  with and are
very thoughtful.  They are sensitive people towards their surroundings and
other people.  They enjoy times of intimacy with close friends and love the
quiet and  solitude.  In the aura, a deep and clear blue indicates one of pure
magickal devotion.  A  pale and etherial blue shows devotion to a noble idea.
A bright blue shows one given to  loyalty and sincerity.  The sixth color is
indigo.

Indigo is the color of the true seeker on the magickal path. They are one
dedicated to the magickal quest and only the magickal quest.  People with
indigo predominate in their  aura are the ones who aim at the stars and
succeed for they combine the ideal with the  practical.  They have developed a
magickal maturity which will carry them unto their  ultimate goal; the goal of
Night Consciousness.  The final color to study is violet.   Violet is the
highest vibration of color that can be seen in the aura.  The souls who have
this color in predominance are very rare indeed.  They are supersensitive and
will hold to  their ideals even at the cost of personal suffering.  All the
great works of art owe their  realization to the souls who have this color in
their aura.  Violet is the stimulator of ideals  and provides nourishment for
the brain cells in the upper brain which gives greater  magickal
understanding.  They are people of a mature, well- rounded personality.  They
are strong in character with sound judgement in all things.  They have
excellent mental  abilities and strong reasoning capabilities.  They have the
highest sense of personal  integrity.  People are strongly attracted to them.
They are introspective and temperamental. They can be easily irritated because
of their sensitivity.  They enjoy the refinements of life, but can easily
forego these and endure the most austere of lives, if it  will serve their
purpose in attaining their goals.  So far, I have said a great deal about the
colors of the aura itself.  This won't help you, if you can't see them.

To be able to see the aura you will need to go back to the topic on seeing the
Etheric  (Topic 17).  If you have been studying and practicing seeing the
etheric, then you will soon  be able to see the Astral aura.  The aura is not
easy to see.  The colors in the aura are of  a much higher vibration then the
energies of the Etheric, and this requires that you have  greater development
of the Night Eye.  It requires that you do not become impatient and  give up.
The lower colors, those from red to yellow, will be the easiest to see.  The
higher  colors may elude you for some time. Do not forget that you can also
see thought images  or in other words pictures projected onto the auric
screen.  The procedures for seeing the  Astral aura are identical for seeing
the Etheric.

It is best to begin with a period of meditation before trying to see the aura
so that you will  be in the highest of magickal states and awareness.  All of
this will take time and practice  on your part but the effort is well worth
it.  You will help your magickal development and  learn more about people.
You will come to know people for what they truly are inside  when you can see
their auras.  The second exercise involves strengthening the aura.

To strengthen the aura, you must first cross your wrists and your ankles.
This will  complete your bodily circuit and prevent your energies from being
dissipated.  You must  also slow down and deepen your breathing.  A few
minutes of Night Breathing would be  excellent.  You should then see added
energy flowing down your silver cord, from your  Oversoul, adding tremendous
Power to your aura.  This will aid you when dealing with  others who try to
exert their own aura against you.  This often takes place between people  in
business who are negotiating a contract between themselves.  It will also aid
you in  trying to see someone else's aura along with your own.  If you are
trying to view another  person's aura, and they are practicing with you, have
them do this too.  You will find you  can see it much easier and more clearly.
The progression of the colors from red to violet  marks the road of a Night
Magician's journey.

You must develop the highest qualities and characteristics of each color.
Ultimately, you  must master each.  Through mastery of the qualities embodied
in the colors and their  energy added to your aura, you will see yourself
progressing towards Night  Consciousness.  As you learn to see your aura, you
can identify the colors and the  character they represent.  If they are not of
the highest standard then you can work for  their improvement. Again, strive
to achieve mastery over self.  Embody within yourself the  highest qualities
of the colors.  The next subject is intricately related to auras and colors.
It is the Higher Night Centers.

24.  The Higher Night Centers and Exercises

In topic seventeen, you looked at the purely physical aspects of the Night
Centers.  Here,  you are going to examine the magickal aspects of all seven.
You will discover the powers  that will become yours to use as each Night
Center begins to function within you.  You will  see how colors are related to
each Night Center and learn an important exercise to help  advance the opening
of the Night Centers.  Finally, you will examine and perform an  exercise that
will release the Night Energy through the Night Centers into your world.

First, let's have a quick review of what you learned in topic seventeen.  You
were able to  locate the Night Centers in relation to the physical organs.
The first and lowest was  located at the base of the spine in relation to the
gonads.  The second was located over  the spleen/pancreas and the third over
the navel area or solar plexus.  The fourth is  located at the heart level.
The fifth at the throat.  The sixth at the brow level and the  seventh at the
crown of the head.  The Etheric Centers have a role in your life which
extends beyond the physical plane and your physical bodies.  You saw that the
centers  are for the purpose of keeping all planes in communication with each
other. As you grow  magickally, the Night Centers begin to unfold more and
release their energies into your  life.  As these centers unfold, you become
aware of the higher things on those realms. As  you develop magickally, all
Night Centers on all realms evolve and receive continually  higher energies
which pour into your lives.  This releases abilities and powers into your
life not normally present in the lesser evolved.  What are the abilities and
powers of each  awakening Night Center, and what do they mean to you?

Let me begin by saying, "DO NOT FORCE YOUR DEVELOPMENT!"  As you proceed in
this  topic, I will cover the powers which will awaken in you as you develop
magickally and the  Night Centers begin to open.  In the unevolved, only the
minimum of energy flows through  the Night Centers to the physical body so
that there is life. But as you develop magickally,  the centers evolve and the
Oversoul is able to send more of Its Energies through you.  As  long as you
develop along magickal lines, the Oversoul will send ever greater Energies
through you.  But do not practice any form of Night Meditation, or Yoga, or
whatever,  which will force the development of the base Night Center.  This is
the seat of the Earth  Fire.  In the eastern languages, it is referred to as
the Kundalini.  The Earth Fire is Life.  It  is the Energies of Life itself.
This Energy lies in the base Night Center of all planes. It is a  powerful and
special Energy which when released, will surge upward through the Night
Centers and awaken each of them to their fullest extent.  Only if you are
fully and  magickally developed and have special guidance from a magickal
teacher of the Higher  Realms will you survive such a forced awakening.  For
example, the Earth Fire, on its way  up, could very easily tear through tissue
and destroy various organs and cause physical  death.  This is the least that
could happen!

The second Night Center is concerned in its undeveloped state with sensual
gratification, sexual desires, and reproduction.  If the Fire is unleashed
while the Night Center is  magickally undeveloped, then all the bad traits of
this center will be extremely heightened  which could result in
uncontrollable, depraved, sexual conduct and harm to others.  This  forced
awakening could cause insanity.  Allow the Earth Fire to awaken inside of you,
naturally, as the result of your magickal development.  Grow magickally and
the base  Night Center will awaken in you, as you are ready to handle the
power that is contained  within it.  You will be shown how to unfold the upper
Night Centers but allow the base  center to unfold of itself.  It will awaken
naturally and easily as you unfold magickally.   When this base Night Center
has fully awakened, you will become the Oversoul.  You will  be a Night
Magician of the highest degree. In the beginning of your development, this
center will glow with a reddish light.   When you have achieved Night
Consciousness it  will glow with an intense dark light of incredible power.

The second Night Center relates to your passions.  The deeper your passions
are and involvement in lust and sexual gratification the darker the red of
this center's light.  As you develop magickally, a dark light begins to be
added to the red till the center is all aglow in  the Night.  In its highest
development, this Night Center will allow one to overcome  disease, old age,
and eventually physical death.  This is a great center of vitality.  It
absorbs the orange light and distributes the energies throughout one's being.
As this  Night Center begins to awaken, you will be able to remember journeys
taken into the  Astral Realm at night.  Upon awakening in the morning, you
will begin to have vague  recollections of what they did in the Astral that
night as their body slept.  You will  probably have the feeling of flying
while in the Astral Realm.

The third Night Center as it awakens will give you the feeling of an awareness
of Astral presences.  You will become very conscious and sensitive to all
manner of psychic and  Astral influences. Some of these influences may feel
good, while others may induce in  you a sense of fear.  On the lowest levels,
this center is associated with power, mastery,  and ego control.  This is the
center for engrossment in material matters and their control.   On the highest
levels, this center will be able to help you achieve strong magickal rapport
with your fellow Astral brothers.  This center is used to contact Astral
entities.  This Night  Center should be surrounded in the Night Pillar such
that the contact remains a contact  and does not allow the Astral entities
control over your bodily mechanism.

The next Night Center is the crossroad for all centers.  This is the fourth
Night Center and  it is located over the heart.  As this center begins to open
on the  etheric level, you will  begin to have an emotional rapport with
others.  You will be able to know and feel the  emotions of others around you.
You will have empathy with them on all levels of feeling,  to include that of
feeling their pains as your pains.  Located within this Night Center is the
"Heart of the Oversoul".  This is the anchor within your magickal being placed
there by  your Oversoul.  It is around this miniature dark star that all that
you are is gathered.  You  can liken it to a small miniature Oversoul.  It is
the embryo of your Oversoul beginning.  As  you begin on the path of Night
Magick and continue to grow magickally, you will see this  embryo begin to
grow into a small child of the Oversoul.  The farther along you develop,  the
child will continue to develop and grow, until you gain Night Consciousness
and the  Oversoul within you is a full adult.  This center actually does exist
and can be seen in  meditation.  You will learn to do this in a later topic.
It is the focal point in your world  where you, as a Night Magician, can go
and meet your Oversoul.  In this center's fullest  development, the Power of
your Oversoul will pour out from you.  Through the Energy  pouring out of you
there will be nothing you cannot do. This is the Center of the Night in  which
you move and have your being.

Through the fifth Night Center, you gain the ability for clairaudience.
Clairaudience is the ability to hear voices in the Astral Realm.  You will
have the sensation of hearing those on  the other side, as you can hear those
on this side of life. You may also be able to hear the  "Music of the Night
Spheres". As this center continues to develop, you will be able to  clothe
your thoughts in form.  The thoughts you generate with your mind, through this
center, will be able to take on direction and energy and go forth and do as
directed.   Through the development of this center, you will achieve strong
will power which will see  you through difficult tasks.  Through this center,
you will achieve true mastery over  yourself and life.  This is only, though,
when you link up this center with that of the heart.   Together, these centers
in unison can do anything.

In Night Magick, the sixth center is the Night Eye.  As this center begins to
develop, you  first perceive Astral shadows.  You will often see nothing more
then clouds of color.  As  the Night Eye continues to develop, you will be
able to see Astral people, landscape, and  symbols.  When the Night Eye is
fully developed, you will be able to have true seeing  which you call
clairvoyance. Clairvoyance is the ability to see and know Truth in all its
forms.  It is seeing and knowing as the Oversoul within you sees and knows.
You will be  able to see the past and present.  You will be able to see
anyplace at anytime and be  able to enlarge, in the physical world, matter
ranging in size from small to microscopic.   In the future, you will be able
to see the probabilities of what might happen.  In the future,  there is
little which must happen, and a great deal which can change according to your
actions.  Thus, according to the way things seem to be forming you can see
what will  probably  happen. The seventh center is the link between your mind
and that of your Oversoul.   In the  beginning, as this center begins to open,
it allows for partial consciousness when you are  in the Astral world.  As
this center unfolds, your consciousness will be more complete, and  you will
perceive the Astral Realm as clearly as you do the physical world.   You will
never  know any cessation of consciousness whether you are in the physical
world or the Astral  world.  As you grow more and more dedicated to doing the
Soul's Will this Night Center  will continue to open on Higher Realms allowing
more and more Magickal Energy to be  released into your everyday world.  You
will become more in tune with what your Higher  Self would have you do in this
world.  When this center has developed far enough, in  conjunction with the
heart Night Center, the Oversoul Child will be born within you.  When  this
Night Center has opened completely, your aura and your word will be filled
with Night  Energies and the aura will glow with a brilliant radiance of the
Night.  From what has just  been said, there can be seen a relationship
between the Night Centers and colors.

Each Night Center, in its pure and developed state, vibrates to a particular
color.  The  base Night Center vibrates to the color red.  The spleen/pancreas
center vibrates to the  color orange. The third center, located over the solar
plexus, vibrates to the color yellow.   The heart center vibrates to the color
green and the throat center to that of blue.  The brow  center, Night Eye,
vibrates to that of indigo, and the highest of Night Centers, the crown,
vibrates to the color violet.  As all the Night Centers are developing
magickally, they will  attain to the purest of colors.  As the Night Centers
reach perfection, they will open, and  the colors will flow till they can be
perceived as the color of the Night.   Let's look at an  exercise which can be
done to develop the Night Centers so that they will radiate in the  Night and
permit your the Night Powers to flow through you.

First, refer back to topic sixteen.  In that topic, we discussed meditating on
the desired  color you needed for healing and projecting it into your Night
Pillar.  You prepared  yourself for meditation with a sheet of color paper,
which would help you concentrate, and  draw to you, the desired color energy
that you wished to use.  Let's again do the same  technique, only this time,
instead of sending the color into your Pillar, you will send it into  the
specific Night Center you wish to stimulate.

You should first see the specific Night Center, in your mind, and feel that
great wheel of  Night Energy slowly rotating, and see the specific color
desired flowing into the Night  Center and stimulating it.  See the center
whirling faster and faster as the result of the  inflow of color energy.   See
the center becoming a pure channel for the color energy and  the impure
energies leaving it.  Further, see the added Energies of the Oversoul flowing
into the center via the silver cord.  Do this with all of the Night Centers
except the base  Night center.  This is an excellent exercise will actually
bring the Night Energies from the  Higher Realms and then release them into
the physical world around you.  Stand with  your feet together, and your arms
and hands outstretched, as you form a living X.  Palms  should be facing
outward.  Now you must become very calm and silent within. See  yourself as
the Oversoul on Earth.  See yourself as a  Night Being.  Now, you will bring
into your being Two Great Energies. Through the soles of your feel, you will
see the Earth  Energies rise up, and at the same time, you will be drawing
into you the Night Force  flowing from your Oversoul down through the Crown
Night Center.  These Energies will  meet in the heart Night Center.  As they
meet, see these Energies going out, under the direction of your Oversoul and
the Night Gods, healing, cleansing, purifying, and touching  the Earth.  If
you know someone in special need of the Energies, see them flowing to her  or
him.  As you continue to practice this exercise the flow of the Energies will
become  stronger and stronger.  You will be of true service to the Night
Guild.  You will truly be a  Night Magician when the Night Centers radiate in
the night of your world.  I said earlier,  that as the Crown Night Center
begins to open, you have partial awareness of the Astral  Realm.   Yet, your
awareness is often distorted.  One state of awareness that you have of  your
Astral journeys is the dream state.  In our next discussion, you will enter
the Dream  Realm.

25.  The Dream Realm 

There are a great many books on the market dealing with the topic of dreams.
Many of  these books list the symbols which you see in your dreams and then
tell you what they  mean, or what is going to happen because of what you
dreamed.  But interpreting dreams  is just not that easy.  Dreams are a very
personal thing to each of us.  A dog, seen in one  dream, may mean one thing
to me and a totally different thing to you.

To begin with, there are two basic types of dreams.  The first type of dream
is a common occurrence in most people's lives. This is the dream when upon
awakening you have only  vague recollections of what transpired.  These are
dreams which you rapidly forget what  took place. They are very confusing
dreams and are the mental garbage which your mind  gets rid of as you sleep.
The second type of dream is what you need to pay attention to.

These are dreams which you remember very vividly upon awakening. You see
images,  and possibly colors, vividly.  You feel that you were actually there
and taking part in what  was going on.  You have a sharp recollection of what
took place and you do not easily  forget what transpired after awakening.  If
this is the kind of dream that has occurred in  your life, then you are
remembering an actual experience that has taken place in the  Astral Realm.
You can also be witnessing a message that is meant to help guide your  life.
The first type of dream you can forget about.  This is just your mind getting
rid of a  lot of mental garbage and worries pressed upon it, or a distortion
of a journey in the Astral  Realm.  The second type is important. You have
often heard of the phrase, "sleep on it",  in connection with solving a
problem that you cannot seem to resolve.

When you sleep on a problem, you are out in the Astral Realm and can meet with
people  on that side of life and receive an answer to your problem.  The
answer generally comes  to you in the form of a dream.  There are other things
that can be done in the use of your  dreams.

Let's say that you have an important interview with a client coming up.  The
night before,  you will need a picture of your client that you're going to
meet.  Preferably, this should be  a physical picture or a strong mental
picture will suffice.  Then before going to sleep, you  should concentrate on
the picture of your client and think of the thing you would like your  client
to do.  Think and say the things to your client that will persuade her/him
your way.   Then put it out of your mind and just know, that as you sleep, you
will meet your client in  the Astral and this will help prepare your way in
tomorrow's meeting.  You will be  successful if you do this. You can see that
there are endless variations and possibilities  in the use of your dreams.
You can also help improve your dreaming.   The first thing you should do in
helping yourself in dreaming is find out which way you  sleep best.  The body
best picks up magickal currents by having the head facing in a  certain
direction.  Practice sleeping with your head pointed say to the North and keep
a  record on how you slept for a week.  Then the next week, sleep in a new
direction and do  the recording.  You should do this for all four directions.
This is the first step towards  better sleeping and dreaming.

To further improve dreaming do the following: when you fall asleep at night,
say to  yourself that you're going to remember all that you dream of clearly
and sharply.  Say this  over and over to yourself until you fall asleep
naturally.  Know that you are going to dream  true!   Now, you will want to
keep a diary of your dreams.

Keep this diary by your bed along with a pen.  Upon awakening from a vivid and
true  dream, record what you saw and the impressions of what it meant to you.
If the dream is  in a very symbolic form, then take that dream into your
meditation periods and seek to  discover the meaning of those symbols.  As
said before, symbols are a very personal thing  to you and their meaning lies
with the Oversoul and Night Teacher.  You may want to  record these symbols on
a three by five card and arrange them alphabetically.   Symbolism is used a
great deal of the time by your Oversoul for communication with you.
Symbolism is used so that you will spend more time in communication with your
Night  Teacher and Oversoul in seeking an answer.  Dreams are important.  It
is important for you to become familiar with your dreams and their meaning.
Dreams  are one means by which the Oversoul may speak with you and give
important information  to guide your life. This could be from warnings
concerning your health or well-being to job  assistance or ways to improve
your practice of Night Magick.  Another mode of  communication is the Oracle,
which we will discuss in the next topic, along with a discussion of Astral
Guides and the use of Trance.

26.  Astral Guides, Oracleship, and Trance

You are never alone in this world.  You may feel that you stand on some
deserted island  in the middle of the ocean, yet you should take comfort in
the fact that all around you your  Guides and Teachers are with you each and
every moment of the day and night.  In  addition to discussing the Guides, you
will also explore communication with the Astral  Guides, or oracleship, and a
special state of consciousness, the Trance.  To begin with,  let's take a
close look at who your Guides and Teachers really are?

Your Guides and Teachers are actually two distinct groups of magickal helpers.
The  Guides are those who have remained on the Astral Realm and assist you
from that  dimension.  They are composed of both relatives and friends of your
past lives who are  gaining valuable experience and magickal growth by
assisting you on the physical plane.   You should remember that their
personalities are still very much akin to the ones they  had in their last
life.  There are Specialist who come under this group of Guides.  They  assist
you with special guidance if you are undertaking a special task and need their
magickal expertise. They assist those in the process of transition from
physical to Astral  living.  They are the Astral doctors and nurses. The other
group is made up of those I  term Teachers.

They are a magickally advanced group of Beings.  They administer to you from a
much  higher realm of existence.  The Realm of the Soul.  They are usually
with you from the  beginning of time and follow you long into your magickal
development.  As you reach a  special development in your magickal path, the
rank of the Teacher continues to advance  until you work with your Night
Teacher.  I will discuss the Night Teachers in a later topic.

Everyone on this planet has been led by inspiration at some time or another,
but most  have never taken the time to try and understand where that
inspiration came from.   Inspiration has its origins from two different
sources.  The first is your Oversoul and is of  the highest form of
inspiration.  The second is guidance given to you through your  Magickal
Guides and Teachers. You can receive a closer rapport with your Guides and
Teachers by learning to remain in a state of inner listening, by remaining in
a state of  inner awareness, knowing that they are always with you and that
you can receive from  them guidance in all that you do. You must begin by
accepting their Presence and knowing that you can communicate with them.
Whenever you can shut out the outer world and its problems, then can you hear
them speak to you.  You must always carefully weigh what they tell you and
know that,  ultimately, the decision is yours.  They never compel you to do
anything, but simply guide  you as to what the probabilities are and then it's
your decision.  You may be able to hear  the Astral message, but some are
exceptionally good at hearing those from the Astral  Realm.  These individuals
are Oracles. An Oracle is a person who through a difference in body and brain
structure is able to  receive messages from the Astral with an exceptional
clarity.  They are individuals with a  delicate physical and nervous system
upon which Astral Spirits may impress the  message.  The person enters an
altered state of consciousness, whereby the Guide or  Teacher is able to
impress upon the nervous system the message to be given.  The  Highest Guide
or Teacher also acts as a traffic controller regulating which Guide or
Teacher will give a message and who will not, through the Oracle.  The Oracle
must  remain in a very passive state of mind.  The Oracle is only a link
between this world and  that of the Astral.  There are degrees of passivity in
consciousness for the Oracle.  The  Oracle may retain almost total
consciousness while seeing and hearing the message, and  then again,
consciousness may be totally repressed by the Guide or Teacher.  This total
repression of consciousness, in the Oracle, is known as Trance.

Trance is an altered state of consciousness, whereby the Oracle's
consciousness leaves  the body and that of a Higher Entity enters into it.
Thus, the Higher Entity has free reign  to speak and act through the body
instrument without misinterpretation by the Oracle.  In  the other form of
oracleship, the Oracle hears and interprets what s/he sees and in this  case
s/he does not. Generally, for the Oracle in Trance, it seems as if s/he has
been  pleasantly sleeping.  Depending on the Oracle's development, s/he can go
into Trance on  the physical plane and still remain conscious and active on
the Astral plane, and so can  control the type of entity who is giving the
message through her/his body, to those on the  physical plane who are
listening.  Even if the Oracle cannot remain awake in the Astral,  there is
nothing to fear.  If her/his body, emotions, and thoughts are one with the
Oversoul  then nothing can happen to her/him while s/he is in a state of
Trance.  Here is a warning  to those who would attempt to practice the state
of Trance.  If you are without fear and  know that there is nothing to be
afraid of, and live in the Night Pillar of the Oversoul, then  no harm can
befall you.  Remember this, keep your thoughts at one with the Oversoul and
nothing bad will ever happen to you.  If you cannot live in this state of
being then do not  try to reach a state of Trance.  Otherwise, you are subject
to entry and hold by the lower  mischievous entities. Most people have a
safeguard against entering Trance and that is falling asleep, but entry and
hold is still possible at just the point of falling asleep, and  the point of
awakening.  This can only occur when you are attempting to reach the state of
Trance. This cannot occur if you are just normally going to sleep.  Have no
fear, but live in  the Oversoul and no wrong entry can occur to you during the
state of Trance.  There are  several forms of Trance.

There is the kind, just mentioned above, whereby a Higher Entity uses your
body to  transmit a message to a group of listeners while the Oracle is in a
soporific state.  There  is also what is called Night Trance. Here the Oracle
can be fully conscious and by his own control deliberately enter the state  of
Trance rather then it being induced by the possessing Higher Entity.  The next
kind is  called Magician's Trance.

Here, the body is very rigid, even to the point of having hard skin.  You are
still in your  body, but what you see can be likened to sitting on the highest
peak with a telescope.  In  other word wherever you look, you can see what is
transpiring. There is no limit as to  where or what you can see.  Time,
distance, and/or physical structures are no obstacles to  your seeing.  The
final kind is called Trance Projection.

Here you leave the body.  The flesh remains very limp and the breathing
greatly reduced.   The heart rate is also greatly reduced.  Again, there are
no limits to where you can see.  Everyone, to one degree or another can
receive messages from the Astral.  It is important  that everyone learn to
take time to know and become close to their Guides and Teachers.   Their
messages of guidance and help can completely change the world that you live
in.   There is no limit to the aid that they can provide in your world.  Take
the time to still the  mind and body so that you may hear the guidance that
they have to offer you.  It is not  essential that you try the states of
Trance.  You should only induce the state of Trance  under the guidance of
your Magickal Teacher.  Therefore, I have omitted the how-to  instruction for
the state of Trance.  You should not try the different states of Trance unless
you are sure of what you're doing and that you're entering them with the
correct frame of  mind and under the proper supervision.  Above all learn
this, "To be still and know the  Oversoul."  This is the key to Night Magick
and Night Consciousness.  We have been  discussing the magickal influence of
your Astral Guides and Teachers.  Yet, they are only  one magickal source, out
of many, that influence your life. Another great source of  magickal influence
over your emotional and magickal life is the Goddess Diana.  She is  better
known to you as the Presence of the Moon.

27.  The Moon and Its Rites

There are many roads of magickal evolution which are filled with excitement,
adventure, accomplishment, and success by those who travel them.   One of
these roads is serving as  the indwelling life force for souls within a moon,
planet, or star.  The stars, planets, and  moons are the physical bodies of
Great Beings who are on far on the road of magickal  evolution.  Of all these
grand Bodies, the one most symbolic of this chapter on Water  Magick is the
Moon.

The Moon of the Earth exerts great influence over the tides of the ocean.  You
can then  extend the Moon's influence over the Tides of humankind's emotions.
In this topic, you  will examine this function and the magickal role that the
Moon plays in your life.  You will  also study and perform special rites
associated with the Moon.  Let's begin by looking  directly at the magickal
role of the Moon.

You see the Moon because it is lit by the reflected light from the Sun.  The
Moon is a  source of Yin Light for it takes the Light of the Sun and
transforms it into Yin Light.  This  Energy is at a lesser extent, when the
Moon is new, for it reflects lesser quantities of the  transformed Energies.
The Energies of the Moon can help directly in the process of your  Oversoul's
gaining control over your emotions.  The Energies of the Moon passing  through
your Oversoul where in turn, they are purified and added to your aura, go on
to  strengthen and build emotional stability.  The Energies of the Moon are
very powerful and  add great Magickal Force to your life when purified.  The
Oversoul, acting as a filter,  filters out the impurities of the Moon's
Energies caused by the grey energies that come  from humankind. After
filterization, you have the Moon's Pure Magickal Energies, and the  Moon
shines in the night as a Luminous Orb of Rarified Power.  When your life and
aura  are illumined with the Yin Light of the Oversoul and is in turn
magnified by the Moon, a  great reflector, then is your Power in the Night
multiplied to its maximum.  You are  likened to the Moon, when you, as a Night
Magician, use your purified Night  Consciousness to reflect the Yin Light of
the Moon into the world.  You are the Moon, a  reflector of the Night
Energies.  The time of the New Moon is a time of new beginnings.

It is a time when a Night Magician should consecrate and dedicate her/his
aspirations  and life anew unto her/his Oversoul.  Thus you celebrate this
time with a rite of new  beginning.  The rite unfolds as follows:

Make sure your Night Altar is ready except don't fill the chalice with any
wine or grape  juice. Putting on your Night Robe and arming yourself with your
Night Weapons place the  Night Pillar around yourself, the Night Altar, and
the world.   Put in your right hand the  Night Wand; face the direction of
North which symbolizes the element of Water; and now  while making the sign of
Night Magick, see fig.___, say this solemn invocation to the First  of the
Four Great Beings of the Cosmic Elements: "I invoke the Great Powers of the
Cosmic Being of the (insert direction) to flow into my being.  Fill me with
the Cosmic  Power of (insert element).  Renew me in the Power of Night
Consciousness.  Make me a  Being of Cosmic Yin Light.  Guide me upon the Road
of Night Magick."  Then face the  Night Altar and place a little of the
correct element from the vile into the chalice.  The  chalice is symbolic of
you and the element representing the Cosmic Being. Then face the  West and
repeat the entire procedure inserting the correct direction and selecting the
correct element to put into the chalice.  Do this for all four directions.
The correct  elements and directions are as follows: water representing Water
and North; oil  representing Air and the West; salt is of the Earth and South;
and fire(candle) that of Itself  and East.  Now pickup the candle; make the
sign of Night Magick over the chalice; and if there is just you, then repeat
an invocation of dedication of your life and being to the  guidance and care
of your Oversoul, Night Teacher, and Guides.  After this, touch your  first
two fingers of your left hand in the substance of the chalice, and upon your
heart  make the sign of Night Magick and then repeat the Night Invocation on
Earth as follows:

"Let the Earth be filled with the Presence of the Night.  I honor the Presence
of the Night  in all I say and do.  By the Night all things are given, by the
Night all enemies removed.   By the Yin Light of the Moon I shall walk the
Night Road on Earth in power, and glory and  victory forever. So be it."

After this you will need to hum for ten to thirty minutes. Although you
probably know how  to hum let me make sure.  With your lips shut and together
make the "mmmm" sound.    Hum the sound such that eventually you'll feel a
resonance building in your head.  As you  head begins to resonate, this
resonance will spread over your body and you will begin to  feel yourself
vibrating and pulsating.

If there are others doing this with you, then select one to be the officiant.
The officiant will  do all that has been described so far, up to the point of
saying the Night Invocation on  Earth. Each member present will repeat a
silent prayer of dedication to her/his life and  being, and committing it to
the guidance and care of her/his Oversoul, Night Teacher, and  Guides.  After
this, the officiant will touch her/his first two fingers of her/his left hand
in the  substance of the chalice, and upon each member's heart s/he will make
the sign of Night  Magick and repeat the following: "With the substance of the
Four Worlds and the Powers  thereof, may you forever be guided on the Road of
Night Magick and become a Night  Magician."  Then, repeat the Night Invocation
on Earth, in unison. Everyone will then hum  in unison till stopped by the
officiant. This is the Rite of the New Moon.  A time of joyous,  beautiful
renewal in Night Magick.

The next rite is in celebration of the Full Moon.  The Full Moon marks the
time of  realization, attainment, and fulfillment.  The consecration and
deepening within of these  aspects is celebrated in a very beautiful rite.  If
there is just you performing this rite, then  you will need only one small
candle on a plate.  In addition, you will need two more small  plates; one
containing sage and the other holding your vessel of water.   With these
things in hand, you are now ready to begin.

Place these three things on your floor Night Altar, with the candle in the
middle, the sage  on the right, and the water on the left.  Place them such
that you will be seated facing the  North with them in front of you.  Then
before being seated, take the candle in your right  hand and with your left
hand clear the four points of direction.  You will begin with the  East and
move counterclockwise making the sign of Night Magick and repeating to each
direction:  "This way is the clear road to Night Magick bathed in the Yin
Light of the Full  Moon."  Now be seated, repeat the Night Invocation of the
Earth and enter into a deep  silence and communion with your Oversoul and feel
the achievement of knowing and  being the Oversoul on Earth.  Now take a small
portion of the sage in your right hand and  say, "This is the Spirit of the
Night in form upon the Earth.  It is the Essence of a Night  Magician.  Honor
to the Night Spirit that I have achieved all that I AM".  Place the sage
around the candle.  The candle should be lit from the beginning of the rite.
Next pickup  the water in your left hand and repeat "Water is the Night Spirit
in pure Essence.  It is the  Power of the Spirit and Life on Earth. I AM the
Waters of Life and the Night Soul on  Earth." Pour the water around and on the
sage.  Now repeat, "the Night Soul united, One  and forever, in Spirit, Power,
and Life, within that which I am, a Night Magician.  So be it".   Close by
humming the "mmmm" sound till you resonate deeply the sound. If there is  more
then one then use the following guidelines.

Everyone present will have the same plates and materials before them.
Selecting one as officiant, s/he will clear the four points following the same
procedures outlined earlier.   S/he will stand in the center of the circle
formed by all the celebrants and begin in the  East.  Then everyone should be
seated.  Hum together after seated.  Continue all as the  same in unison.

The final rite requires nothing other then yourself.  Be seated comfortably on
the ground  at eventide, or night, when the light of the Full Moon may fall
upon you.  Doing this on a cloudless night is best.  Put the Night Pillar
around yourself and all members  participating.  If there are more people
doing this then just yourself, then all should face  towards the Moon. Begin
with Night Breathing for a few minutes.  Then you will visualize,  and all
with you, the Light of the Full Moon passing through your Oversoul.  Know that
the  Moon's Energy is being purified of all the Earth's human dross and is
flowing now into  your Astral Body and aura.  See yourself filled with a most
intense, pure Yin Light.  This  Light will give you emotional stability and
inner strength.  Do this, feeling the Night Soul's  Presence being magnified
within yourself. Know that you are the Oversoul.

You have learned from the Moon and its cycles, that it represents your
beginning upon  the path of Night Consciousness in its New Moon phase and ends
with your fulfillment as  the Night Soul in the Full Moon phase.  Use
carefully the Light of the Moon.  The Light of  the Moon must be purified by
the Oversoul before it can be accepted into your world.   Thus, you must
always remain in Night Consciousness in order to reflect into your world  only
the Night Energies.  The Moon is a very Advanced Being.  The Moon is a great
reflector of the Yin Light into your world during its night.   The Goddess
Diana is the  Master of the Element Water on Earth.  Now, you, too, will
become Master of the Element  Water in the next topic.

28.  Water Rites  

Water is representative of the Night Spirit.  Water is Life and the Night
Spirit.  I will  introduce two rites which embody the use of water.  Water is
a very powerful magnet and  container for the Night Energies.  Water will
greatly intensify your drawing power of the  Night Force.  The first rite that
I will teach is designed simply to aid your drawing upon,  and concentrating
the Night Force.

Begin by obtaining a glass bowl, similar to a mixing bowl, with a large open
space at the  top. The size you will need is based upon the number of people
participating with you.   You should have a bowl set aside for private use and
one for group use. When your not  using the bowl keep it wrapped and in a
place so that no one else will disturb it.  You will  also need three black
candles, your Night Altar that is close to the floor, and a black cloth  to
cover the table.  Setup the Night Altar so that you, or the officiant, when
seated at the  altar faces North.  If there are others present then they
should be seated around the altar.  The Night Altar should be covered with the
altar cloth.  Fill the bowl full of water and place  it in the center of the
Night Altar. Finally, everyone will be seated, but the officiant who will
light the three candles and place two of them on the outer edges of the group.
Now that  you have these things setup your ready to begin.

Light the incense with the third candle; face West of the Night Altar; and
with the lit, black candle in your right hand and while making the sign of
Night Magick with the left hand  repeat the following invocation: "Let only
the Night Spirit remain here and only the Night  Spirit go out.  This room is
protected in the Yin Light of the Oversoul.  Let the Light of the  Night
Brethren enter here and only the Night Force remain.  The first Night Guardian
shall  remain this way and only the Night Spirit's Power will stay.  So be
it".  Now turn  counterclockwise to the next major direction and repeat again
this invocation.  Each time  preceding it with the sign of Night Magick.  Do
this again in the third major direction, and  finally over the Night Altar
itself. Then take your seat on the floor before the bowl and  again surround
yourself with the Night Pillar.  Contact your Oversoul and begin to draw  into
yourself the Night Force.  Then reach out and touch the bowl with both your
hands,  one on each side of the bowl.  If this is being done as a group, then
all will interlock  fingers when hands are placed upon the bowl by all members
present.  All should see the  Force flowing into themselves, and then into the
bowl filling the bowl with the Night Force.  Continue to do this as long as
you, and the members with you, feel comfortable and can  control the Force.
If at anytime you should begin to feel uncomfortable, you should stop  and
again stand and clear all four corners of the room.  Then rest a while before
trying  this again.  This is a tremendous rite for collecting the Night Force
in its most  concentrated form.  After the rite, it is suggested that you
obtain clean drinking glasses  (one for each member present) and dip them into
the water of the bowl and drink of it. Drink as much water as you can
comfortably hold.  The water has a great healing and energizing effect and
will ward off illness for a long time.  It is further effective in aiding
ailing plants and animals.  The benefit of the Force, coursing through your
body, is cause  enough to do this as often as possible.
