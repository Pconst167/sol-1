The ear buzzing you detected while shopping today had nothing to do
with the chair but rather a signal to alert you that the "writing"
of yesterday was not accurate.  That is why the power failure and
loss of the material this evening.   We sense your saddness at the
loss of that material,  as you felt it was worthwhile...but trust
in what we say in this true Transmission.   The concepts conveyed
yesterday were valid,  but the mode was inappropriate and the
distractions did not allow for clear Transmission of thought.  This
is such critical and vital information that it must be correctly
relayed;

Those who Transmit information should not be the focal point of
the work.   This applies to past messengers and your modern day
scribes.  You are scribes.  You chose to come as scribes and 
perform the task of relaying the Universal Knowledge.  This is
true of the ones you call Buddha and Jesus.  They did not ask to
be worshipped.  They attempted to share the Universal Knowledge
and convey to all that each of you can access this information.
That was the message.   They were teachers and there is a
distinction.  You (the personal you as in the form known as 
Jamelle) are a scribe.  You know this.  You chose to be a scribe,
not a teacher.  David is both a scribe and a teacher.  This is
the role selected for this lifetime.  As a scribe,  your work can
be facilitated using the best means available.   This appears to
be a combination of written form and use of the electronic
Transmission.   

(I have a question --  you are transmitting,  I am receiving.
Are you to be acknowledge as a Teacher?)

WE are part of you and you are part of US.   WE are not to be
the focal point of the work.   WE are shifting and comprised of
various entities in what you think of as time.  This is not as
critical as the Universal Knowledge.   Whether WE include your
father figure,  the One Who Rules the Hierarchy as Was called
Sanat Kumara,  the Kumaras of Light or  the Brotherhood ...
this will not be constant.  The Knowledge IS constant.  The
work is to convey the futility of arguing over Dharma,  Bibles,
Sutras,  and such texts.   The work is to harmonize and blend
the teachings.  To AWAKEN.   Once Awakened,  the Knowledge
can be conveyed directly and there is no need for concern of
format.   This is what is being conveyed to David as the
critical drive path.   The critical part is what will Awaken
others.   Will the Genesis Gospel awaken a critical mass of
humanity?   Is there any one text that will accomplish that
goal?   No.  But,  in the sharing of many texts,  many 
viewpoints,  many Transmissions,  there is an increased 
opportunity for awakening the critical mass.   That is the
need for the 12 parts.   1 viewpoint may not touch the soul
of a person and awaken that person.   but in 12 viewpoints,
twelve totally different perspectives on the same subject,
one of those 12 will touch that soul.   This is true.  This is
why the sharing is the critical drive path.   This is why you
were called the Outreach Coordinator.   You can bring together
12 diverse viewpoints and share these through your electronic
Transmission.   This is why we suggested Master David's text,
the Book of the Lamb,  the War in Heaven document,  our dear
messenger Norma's work,  your own Transmissions,  and the
others which will become clear as they are presented.  These
will represent 12 perspectives.   In the bringing forth of
the 12 will be the Whole.   In the Universal Knowledge it
requires 12 components to make a Whole.   12 ego/personalities
make a soul group.   12 soul groups make an Entity.  12 entities
make a Master.  Remember the teaching of the Great One Sanat
Kumara WHOM conveyed to you 12 x 12 x 12   this was the lesson.
12 Masters make a Brotherhood.    Soon this becomes beyond your
ability to comprehend,  but this is what makes the Universe.
The Whole of the Universe is what some call God,  the Other
Power,  the Energy,  the Spark of Creation.   The 12 Faces of
God.  Perhaps that can be the title of your document,  You
still must compile your Transmissions into such a document as
it is needed as one of the 12 perspectives that will awaken
the masses.   The work is in the sharing.  That is why the
project must go forward.  That is why the project WILL go
forward.   The play is set in motion.   The pieces are coming
together.   that is why you experienced such a sense of
Knowing when you spoke with Master David regarding the
project.  He too Knows it will happen.   Abbe Knows.  Tom
Knows.  Trece Knows.   Marcy Knows.  This is because all of
you have awakened.   Those who remain asleep can be awakened.
And when a critical mass of humanity is Awake,  then the planet
shall be Awake.   This is a Universal Law.  

This is a much better portrayl of the "Truth" than that which
was eliminated during the power failure.  Now you may save this
message and we will say good evening.   We are with you always.
