           'FRIDAY THE 13th': The Television Series
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Paramount Pictures Television is happily announcing a new, fresh
 alternative for television this fall, and its called:'Friday the 
 13th: The Television Series'.
  Although, the series will have NOTHING to do with the movies. The
 TV series will not feature Jason Vorhees. It won'nt have a new crop
 of teenagers slaughtered every week. In fact, it won't have any
 explicit gore at all. It won't be written or directed by the Friday
 the 13th pioneers Sean Cunningham or Steve Miner.
  What the TV series will have is an antique store, a cursed antique
 store that three cousins inherit from a mysterious uncle. The cousins
 have to get back everything that was ever purchased or given away
 from this store since its all cursed. They have a big log listing
 every item, and each week they go to buy or steal back one of those
 items. In one episode the cousins might have to track down a cursed
 necklace a husband bought for his wife before it strangles her to
 death.
  In other words , all the 'Friday the 13th: The Television Series'
 has is the name. In case you are wondering why it is called this
 theres one simple reason: money.

EXPERTS REPORT EVIDENCE THAT THE 'DEVIL' STILL WALKS AMONG US!!!

Mysterious "Devil's Hoofprints" - unexplainable prints that often
trace paths no living creature could follow - have been found again
and again in the U.S. and England, say experts.

  "These hoofprints are shaped like those of a goat or a sheep, but
with two legs", says veteran psychic investigator Ed Warren. "There
are reports of this phenomenon dating back over 100 years...but many
recent cases too.
  "The Hoofprints belong to no known animal or human - thay ARE the
footprints of the Devil."!
  And Brad Steiger, author of 35 books on the paranormal, revealed:
"Devil's Hoofprints have been found not only on the ground, but also
on roofs of houses and the tops of walls. They often follow a path no
known human or animal could take, before vanishing into the thin air".
  In Jan. 1985 a psychologist at a prominent Ivy League college began
counseling a female West Indian student who was very troubled, Warren
recalled:
  "One Afternoon during a therapy session with the girl the psychologist
gazed out her back window down to the top of the garage. There in the
heavy snow were the hoofprints of a cloven-hoofed animal.
  "But there were only two hoofprints at a time, as though the beast
had been walking on it's hind feet. The hoofprints leaped down from
the garage and followed a straight line 20 feet across her yard where
they ended abruptly".
  "The next week during the girl's therapy , there was a loud screeching
outside", Warren continued:
  "But all I could see were more strange hoofprints in the snow. That
Evening there were loud rapping and scratching sounds on all sides of
her home. The next morning she found hoofprints circling around and
around the building".
  At this point Warren was called into the case. "I interviewed the
girl and discovered she'd been possessed by demons while particip-
ating in Occult rituals in her homeland. "The hoofprints had been
left by the Devil". "He had come to visit one of his victims and to
torment the psychologist trying to help her".
  "The girl later underwent an exorcism-and the Devil's hoofprints
have NOT been there since, Warren said.
  In an incredible case that occured in England in the early 1980's,
an accountant saw the Devil's hoofprints on a beach. "The beach was
deserted and gloomy but a single line of hoofprints began at the base
of a tall, unclimbable cliff and ran from there into the sea".
  "Devil Worshippers had once held rituals in the area at night, and
the Devil had arrived on Earth to survey his domain".
  In still another terrifying case, a young couple moved into a sec-
luded old home in rural Massachusetts in Winter, 1984. They spent
their evenings reading Occult books and trying Occult experiments.
Soon they began hearing tinkling music at night-or banging noises.
"When the first heavy snow came, they found hoofprints beginning
under their bedroom window, two by two into an ever widening circle",
said Steiger. Finally the hoofprints became lost in the woods.
  "The couple consulted a paranormal expert-who determined they had
seen Devil's hoofprints".
  "The strange noises and the Devil's hoofprints were not seen again"!
