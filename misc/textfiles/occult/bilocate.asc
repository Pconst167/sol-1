               MONROE TECHNIQUES FOR ASTRAL PROJECTION (BI-LOCATION)


       Note: After having studied many methods of Astral Projection, I have
             found that  this  is  the easiest to do.  Monroe teaches these
             techniques in a week, but they  can  be  easily done in a day,
             with proper devotion.

             I feel  that this technique is superior to others  because  it
             does not  require  intense  visualization,  which  many people
             cannot do.  Enjoy!

             (Taken from Leaving The Body: A Complete Guide to Astral
                 Projection, D. Scott Rogo, Prentice Hall Press)

       One of the chief barriers people learning to project face is fear.

       Many are afraid that they may die,  or  be  harmed  in some way as a
       result of their  projection.   Nothing  could  be farther  from  the
       truth.

       The Cantebury Institute,  reknowned for its occult studies, executed
       an experiment in projection involving  over  2,000  people.  None of
       them were hurt in any way by this, and now, three years  later, none
       have complained of any newly arising problems.

       Once you are  aware  that  you  cannot  be harmed by projecting, you
       should begin monroe's techniques, step by step.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step one: Relax the body.

       According to Monroe,   "the  ability   to   relax   is   the   first
       prerequisite, perhaps even the first step itself" to  having an OBE.
       (out of body experience)

       This includes both  physical  and mental relaxation. Monroe does not
       suggest a method of attaining this relaxation, although Progressive
       Muscle relaxation, coupled with deep  breathing exercises (inhale 1,
       exhale 2, inhale 3.... until 50 or 100) are known to work well.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step two: Enter the state bordering sleep.

       This is known  as  the  hypnagogic state. Once again, Monroe doesn't
       recommend any method of doing this.  One way is to hold your forearm
       up, while keeping your upper arm on the bed, or ground. As you start
       to fall asleep, your arm will fall, and you will awaken again.  With
       practice, you can  learn to control  the  Hypnagogic  state  without
       using your arm.

       Another method is  to concentrate on an object.  When  other  images
       start to enter your thoughts, you have entered the Hypnagogic state.
       Passively watch these images.  This will also help you maintain this
       state of near-sleep. Monroe calls this Condition A.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step three: Deepen this state.

       Begin to clear your mind.  Observe your field of vision through your
       closed eyes.  Do  nothing more for a while. Simply look through your
       closed eyelids at the blackness in front of you.

       After awhile, you  may  notice light  patterns.   These  are  simply
       neural discharges.  They have no specific effect.  Ignore them.

       When they cease,  one  has  entered what Monroe calls  Condition  B.
       From here, one  must  enter an even deeper state of relaxation which
       Monroe calls Condition C-- a state of such relaxation that you lose
       all awareness of the body and sensory  stimulation.   You are almost
       in a void in which your only source of stimulation  will be your own
       thoughts.

       The ideal state for leaving your body is Condition C.  This is
       when it is voluntarily induced from a rested and refreshed condition
       and is not the effect of normal fatigue.

       To achieve Condition  C,  Monroe suggests that you practice entering
       it in the morning or after a short nap.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step Four: Enter a state of Vibration.

       This is the most important part of  the technique, and also the most
       vague.  Many projectors have noted these vibrations at the onset
       of projection.  They can be experienced as a mild tingling, or as is
       electricity is being shot through the body.

       Their cause is a mystery.  It may actually be the astral body trying
       to leave the physical one.  For entering into the vibrational state,
       he offers the following directions:

            1. Remove  all  jewelry or other items that might  be  touching
               your skin.

            2. Darken the room so that no light can be seen through your
               eyelids, but do not shut out all light.


                                      Page 2





            3. Lie down with your body along a north-south axis, with your
               head pointed toward magnetic north.

            4. Loosen  all  clothing,  but  keep  covered  so  that you are
               slightly warmer than might normally be comfortable.

            5. Be sure you are in a location where, and at a time  when,
               there will be absolutely no noise to disturb you.

            6. Enter a state of relaxation.

            7. Give yourself the mental suggestion that you will remember
               all that occurs during the  upcoming  session  that  will be
               beneficial to your weel-being. Repeat this five times.

            8. Proceed to breath through your helf-open mouth.

            9. As you breath, concentrate on the void in front of you.

           10. Select a point a foot away from your forehead, then change
               your point of mental reference to six feet.

           11. Turn  the  point 90 degrees upward by drawing  an  imaginary
               line parallel to your body axis up and above your head.

       Focus there and reach out for the vibrations  at that point and
       bring them back into your body.

       Even if you don't know what these vibrations are, you will know when
       you have achieved contact with them.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step five: Learn to control the vibrational state.

       Practice controling them  by  mentally  pushing them into your head,
       down to your toes, making them surge throughout your entire body,
       and producing vibrational waves from head to foot.

       To produce this  wave  effect, concentrate  of  the  vibrations  and
       mentally push a wave out of your head and guide it down your body.

       Practice this until you can induce these waves on command.  Once you
       have control of the vibrational state, you are ready  to  leave  the
       body.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step six: Begin with a partial seperation.

       The key here  is  thought control.  Keep your mind firmly focused on
       the idea of leaving the body. Do  not  let  it wander. Stray thought
       might cause you to lose control of the state.

       Now, having entered the vibrational state, begin exploring  the  OBE
       by releasing a hand or a foot of the "second body".

       Monroe suggests that  you  extend  a  limb until it comes in contact
       with a familiar object, such as a wall near your bed.

                                      Page 3





       Then push it  through the object. Return the limb by placing it back
       into coincidence with the physical  one,  decrease  the  vibrational
       rate, and then terminate the experiment.

       Lie quietly until you have fully returned to normal. This exercise
       will prepare you for full seperation.

       --------------------------------------------------------------------

       Step seven: Dissociate yourself from the body.

       Monroe suggests two methods for this.  One method is  to lift out of
       the body.  To do this, think about getting lighter and lighter after
       entering this vibrationa   state.   Think about how nice it would be
       to float upward.  Keep this thought  in mind at all costs and let no
       extraneous thoughts interrupt  it.  An OBE will occur  naturally  at
       this point.

       Another method is the "Rotation method" or "roll-out" technique.

       When you have achieved the vibrational state, try to roll over as if
       you were turning   over  in  bed.   Do  not  attempt  to  roll  over
       physically.

       Try to twist your body from the top  and  virtually  roll  over into
       your second body right out of your physical self.   At  this  point,
       you will be out of the body but next to it.

       Think of floating  upward,  and  you  should  find yourself floating
       above the body.

       Monroe suggets you begin with the  lift-out  method, but argues that
       both are equally efficacious.

                If, after all this, you still can't project, I recommend
                purchasing Leaving  The Body, by R. Scott  Rogo.   It  only
                costs $7.95 and contains another eight or so techniques.

                Not all  techniques  work  for  everyone,  but  chances are
                you'll find one that works for you in this book.
                                                     Good luck!
