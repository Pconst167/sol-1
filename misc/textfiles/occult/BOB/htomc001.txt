       2nd Authorized FisTemple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius
          Dr. Philo Drummond, 01 and Cookie Drummond, F.G.O.T.R
                              P.O. Box 1572
                        Maryland Heights, MO 63043

       Yes, "Bob" inexplicably transferred his right-brain man (the first
       and only *true* OverMan) from Dallas to Dioxinland near St.
       Louis.  Those who dare can now contact Philo himself at this
       only other fully-sanctioned P.O. Box.  When Philo and Cookie
       (and the UberBaby, Christinita) were Transported, Church
       combo Drs. for Wotan split into WOTAN SOUTH (Dallas) and
       Philo's new 2000 DOKTORS.  Unless the music is directly
       Dobbs-oriented, send your self-produced EPs to Philo, not
       the Foundation.  Philo knows Dobbs better than anyone -- so
       all Church Bribes should be sent to him as well.

       And Philo possesses the last known stash of the second STARK
       FIST (tabloid sized issue).  It's out of print and a sure-
       fire collector's item.  You can order these precious back
       issues for $5 apiece FROM PHILO ONLY.  We probably will
       reprint it again, but it'll *LOOK* like a reprint.  NHGH got
       to the originals in the form of a fungus that attacks rubber
       cement.

       "The church of the SubGenius was founded in 1978 by DOBBS
       and Doktor Philo Drummond, whose true identity remains a
       secret lest his prominent family in Dallas be mortified by
       his unorthodox religious activities."

       (end of excerpt)

       I personally spoke with Dr. Drummond and Rev. Stang recently
       at the opening date for Drummond's latest Doktor Band, "The
       Swinging Love Corpses".  The MagicK of Mail Order Sales is
       *STILL ALIVE*.  Be sure and ask about the new video.  And
       tell'em "Some Damn Old Nobody" from SWBT sent ya'!
