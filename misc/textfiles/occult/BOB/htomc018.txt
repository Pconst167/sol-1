SHIT ALERT - SHIT ALERT - SHIT ALERT - SHIT ALERT

  The 1993 Award for the worst, phoniest bullshit goes to the entire city of
MYRTLE BEACH, SC.  After seeing it for the first time after a period of several
years, the remaining vestiges of fun have all been turned into cheesy T-shirt
shops.  You can still play any kind of video game you like, as long as that
game is a Kung-fu-fighting game.  The best clubs have closed down, the few that
remain have no slack or vibe whatsoever.  The only thing that hasn't changed is
the legions of butthead police, who must save you from the evils of drinking a
beer or having fun.  The beach itself is OK, being relatively free of toxic
wastes.  Not even doing away with the Sunday alcohol blue-law has helped the
overall scene, though.  If you're looking for fun, don't bother here.
[and for those who might say that its just *me* getting older and more cynical,
go look for yourselves.  The psychic rot from NMB has finally spread south.]

The only thing that kept the whole trip from being a complete fucking waste was
the only late show in town (in a town which once had TONS of midnight movies..)
Not for the squeamish, The Faces of Death part IV
is highly recommended.   This is *real* death on
camera, ranging from the usual series of grisly
accidents, to attacks by deadly mutant creatures
from toxic pollution, culinary treats from other        <Picture of the
cultures, miscalculated bungee jumps,loose psychos       certificate of
in hospitals, and dictatorship police slaughtering       survival>
their own people in the streets.  Maybe the NRA
might be onto something after all.  Plus, if you
can make it through the entire showing, you get 
the OFFICIAL Faces of Death IV certificate of ->
             survival.  It doesn't mention whether
             you made it through without tossing
    G        your cookies, as there were definitely
             a few close calls in the theatre.
    R
             Congratulations, or something like that, to the graduating classes
    A        of 1993.  Now that you've finished kissing the asses of a bunch of
             Conspiracy teachers, get ready to pucker up and bend over for the
    P        Conspiracy "Bureaucrats" that will define your existence from this
             point forward. Give a big thanks to Bill Clinton and previous
    H        administrations for your future career flipping greaseburgers at
             your local McDonald's. Expect the only "change" that will occur
    I        under this current batch of do-gooders is that the pace of the
             Conspiracy will INCREASE.  Don't look at me- I voted for "Bob".

Donating Money for U.S. Debt Is Like Giving Booze to a Wino
by Tom Barberi

     Am I missing something?
     The government has dug a $4.2 trillion - that's $4,200,000,000,000 -
debt.  It has done this by taking every dime it could, with every tax
imaginable and spending more than it took in.
     Now the Clinton administration proposes to pay off the debt by taking
even more money from us.  Not only that, but it is going to spedn a whole
bunch more on new stuff.  On top of that, a 14-year-old North Dakota boy and
his well publicized $1,000 donation toward the national debt has fostered
similar nutty behavior.
     Could it be the hole in the ozone layer?, El Nino?, gloval warming?, Not
evnough dietary fiber?
     What prompts otherwise rational people to take time out of busy lives to
put on a bake sale and send the proceeds to that money-gobbling machine in
Washington?
     I don't get it.  Even a batch of fifth-graders from Ohio peddled baked
goodies cleverly named for our leaders: Bill Brownies, Gore Goodies, Capitol
Hill Cookies, Tipper Toffee and Oval Office Oatmeal.  They raised $278.50.
     I'm surprised they didn't try to market Socks Suckers.  Maybe they
realized those might wake people up.  This wave of citizen guilt for a
problem they didn't create isn't limited to school kids.
     The staff of a weekly newspaper in North Dakota is planning a bake sale.
The Eskimo Pie Corp. has decided to donate to the same cause: 5 cents for
every box of its chocolate-coated vanilla ice cream snacks sold between
tomorrow and April 4th.
     Isn't that like double taxation?  If that company truly wanted to do
something for the economy, wouldn't it make more sense to lower the price of
an Eskimo Pie by 5 cents?  That way the consumer would have more money to
spend supporting other businesses that pay taxes or employ people who pay
taxes.
     Sending the government more money that it already confiscates from us is
like giving a wino a key to the state liquor store.  What is the first thing
that a credit counselor does when people come in for help?  He or she cuts up
the credit cards and creates a budget that will lead them out of debt.
     The ease with which government created this mammoth debt was illustrated
the other night on the news when the manager of a former defense contractor,
who was shifting his company to perform in-military work, said the company
now would have to do some real thinking because private business won't pay
$600 for a toilet seat or $400 for a hammer.
     To put out a fire you have to remove its fuel source.  It only makes
sense that to put out this D.C. spending inferno, we must cut off its money
supply - or at least thin it out.

         The True Adventures of Jim Morrison: Space Ranger  Part 1


     The shooting had stopped.  The jungle's quiet was disturbed only by
the sound of inch-long mosquitos flying through the humid summer air.
A full moon gave Morrison's face a ghastly pall as he reloaded his Tarantula
9000.  The Tarantula was a fine weapon, a 50 caliber recoilless machine
pistol of a type that would not be mass-produced for another twenty years.
     Damn.  If only the Viet Cong patrol hadn't returned to their camp
half an hour early.  Damn.  If only he hadn't gotten separated from his
squad during the firefight.  Damn.  If only any of a vicious chain of events
that deposited him here, alone, hungry and sick, in the jungles of southern
Thailand, hundreds of miles away from his base camp, hadn't happened.  Damn.
     Morrison tried to clear his mind by concentrating on his Tarantula.
It was a prototype, a weapon he had rescued from the laboratories of a
dead Ceylonese weaponsmith, and he hadn't been taking proper care of it.
Now, the loading mechanism was jammed, and he didn't have the tools to
repair it correctly.  He tried to improvise using his pocketknife, the one
he'd picked up during the Doors' last tour, years before.
     He worked long into the night, slapping at the mosquitos that descended
in clouds to drink the blood from his exposed arms and chest.  So intent
was he on his work that he did not notice the subtle change in the quality
of the moonlight as it slowly altered from silvery-white to blood-red, until
the sound of inhuman voices nearby attracted his attention.


     [Moving shot from over the right shoulder of walking man.  All we
can see of the man is his dark blue suit and that he has short Bryllcreemed
hair and a pipe, which occasionally trails smoke into the camera lens.
He walks down a steel-grey corridor, his shoes clicking on the concrete
floor.  He stops at a door with two security guards in front of it.
The guards immediately stand at attention as the man approaches.]

     Man:  Hi guys!  Gee, it's a real scorcher outside, isn't it?

     Guard 1:  Yes, Mr. Dobbs.

     [Guards stand aside as Dobbs approaches a small panel beside the door.
After a retinal scan, fingerprint scan, voice check, and magnetic ID check,
the bolt on the door automatically clicks open.  The camera pans back as
Dobbs enters the room, revealing a blindingly white room, with computer and
medical equipment lining the walls.  Dominating the room is a large plexi-
glass tank with a shadowy figure floating within.  Around the tank are
arranged more pieces of equipment and white-coated technicans.]

     Dobbs:  Hi everybody!  Gee, it's a real scorcher outside, yep.

     TECHNICIANS:  Hello Mr. Dobbs.

     [Dobbs approaches the tank]

     Dobbs:  So this is our man, eh?  Stang, fill me in.

     Dr. Stang:  We found him in Thailand three days ago, during a routine
border patrol.  He was suffering from multiple gunshot wounds and malaria.
It's a miracle he survived as long as he did.  At the time, he kept mumbling
'give me back my tarantulas'.  However, by the time we got him back to
Dobbstown hospital, his condition had degenerated drastically, so I decided
to bring him here.

     Dobbs:  Well, well, well.  Let's have a look at him, okay?

     [Dr. Stang lifts back the cover of the tank to reveal the mad,
glittering eyes of Jim Morrison!]

     Dobbs:  Hi Jim!  Gee, it's a real scorcher outside, huh?

     Dr. Stang:  "Bob", he can't hear you.

     Dobbs:  Well, maybe not with his *brain* so much...

     Dr. Stang:  We've scheduled the brain surgery to implant the microchips
for Thursday...

     Dobbs:  Thursday?  I go bowling Thursday...

     Dr. Stang:  We've already cloned the replacement heart and right leg,
so this will be the last operation.  He'll be recovering in the tanks for
a few months, though.

     Dobbs:  You were able to save the...

     Dr. Stang:  Uh, yes.

     Dobbs:  Oh, good.  Well, once you're back on your feet, Mr. Morrison,
what should I do with you?  Computer?

     Computer:  Hi there, "Bob"!

     Dobbs:  Hi!  What are the latest projections involving Jim by Project
Ragnarok?

     Computer:  A real good question, "Bob"!  It seems Mr. Morrison here
will be vitally important to our plans during the summer of 1997, but the
public can't be allowed to know that he's alive until 1993 at the earliest.
At least, that's what the precogs say.

     Dobbs:  And not letting him do concerts would rob him of vital Slack.
Hmm...

     [Dobbs meditates briefly, and as he does, an eerie high-pitched hum
fills the air.  A technician kicks the terminal next to her and the hum
stops.]

     Dobbs:  Jeepers!  I've got it!  We'll put him on a mini-tour of this
arm of the galaxy.  Jimi's been needing a vocalist, and we can't get Lennon.

     Dr. Stang:  And since he'll be travelling most of the distance near
lightspeed, he'll hardly age, so he'll be in great shape for the end times!
Great work, "Bob"!

     Dobbs:  Aw, shucks.

an art prank.  There was a art show   |                                        
going on, my friends took a 2 foot    |  DJ Darren   Greensboro                
section of a 2X4 and painted it blue, |  DJ Threat   Chapel Hill               
then drove a 10 penny spike into the  |  DJ Thomas   Velvet in Atlanta         
side of it and mounted upright. They  |  w/special performace by PARIS         
named it something odd like "Man's    |

bucks for it.                         |  Call NC Raveline for info
