ZEN AND THE ART OF SLACK========================by James "Kibo" ParryMy mantra is "mantra, dammit".    As I sit here on my zafu (that's a Zen meditation pillow stuffedwith tofu), I reach satori even though I live downstairs from thedemolition derby rink.    I feel a oneness with the itch in my first chakra. I feel a onenesswith the Pet Rock I used to own. I feel a twoness with myself.    I realize that everything is either something or a hole insomething. Or, perhaps, everything is one big hole and the somethingsare holes within the hole. I shift my weight imperceptibly and the zafumakes a fart noise.    Upstairs, two old Trans Ams, surplus from "Knight Rider", collide.    I can hear the sound of my blood moving through my inner ears. Irealize that everything which exists is made up of little dots arrangedin diagonal rows. A cockroach runs across the floor and into my zafu.    I realize that "Bob"'s teeth are clenched and his Pipe is notbetween them. The teeth are joined and the Pipe ends in front of them.His nose casts a shadow on the Pipe and the Pipe casts a shadow on hischin but they do not touch. I have reached enfuckinglightenment!    As I nearly fall off my zafu, it farts again, blowing the cockroachinto the next room.        There once was a novice monk named Bho Zho who asked the master,    "Does a house burn up or burn down?"        The master set fire to the novice's house, after taking all his    money. As the house burned both up and down, the novice was    enlightened.    I bow to the Sacred Halftone Print of "Bob" to thank him for theenlightenment. As I do so, "Bob"'s face shimmers and blurs before myface. All I see is the Dots but not the Smile. All I see is the Smilewithout the Dots. I see both. I see neither. I see the hair of DesiArnaz, the eyes and mouth of Pee-wee Herman, the jaw of Jay Leno allcombined in a blender: "Bob".    "Bob" is before me and I am "Bob" and yesterday is tomorrow and Iam the walrus mama dada googoo chihuahuahuahua ommmmmmmmm    "Yo! Yo! Stop with the satoiri already!" "Bob" steps out of thepicture, slaps me, and pours himself a Dr Pepper. He sits on my zafu,which makes a sound like a tuba. I sit on a tatami which is beginningto sprout. "Bob" looks me in the eye.    "Cool it with the meditation, guy, it's dull. It's `Bosom Buddies'without the laughtrack. It's the sound of one lip chapping. It's abicycle riding a fish, a steamroller being run over by a birthday cake.It just doesn't compare to the fun stuff, especially sex."    I avoid meeting "Bob"'s gaze as I whisper, "He who claims someonedoes not have Buddha-nature has no Buddha-nature."    "Hey, it's easier to say `Slack' than `Buddha-nature', you know. Or`swellness'. They're all the same thing. You're on a true path toenlightenment, but true paths have true dirt and true mosquitoes... falsepaths are much better. Give me your money now."    "I have no money, just one zafu, one tatami, my oryoki, this setsustick, an inflatable Buddha, a tofu log, all three "Sweatin' to theOldies" tapes,  a disposable zabuton, a pile of bulk miso, myZen-to-English dictionary..."    "AND A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE!" "Bob" waggles his eyebrows andsmiles. "But seriously, pal, I'll take it all and pretend it's cashequivalent.  Hey, after I take your zafu, I'll even give you a receipt.Get it? Re-seat!"    "Bob" packs all my worldly possessions into his seeminglybottomless pockets and he leads me out of the monastery. Millisecondslater, a black Trans Am falls through the ceiling, crashing right wherewe had been sitting. It yells insults at us as we walk to the pebblegarden.        "This eggplant in my pocket is like an elephant," said Bhoddyohdor.        "Yet this elephant in my pocket is like a pair of wax lips,"    replied Tai Dhee Bhoul.        Just then, Master Rhais Ahroni strolled past. "Tell us," begged    Bhoddyohdor and Tai Dhee Bhoul, "Is the eggplant like the elephant    which is like the wax lips, or should we just go watch sitcoms all    day?"        The master ate the eggplant, shot the elephant, and got germs on    the wax lips. The novices were not enlightened. The master laughed.    "Bob" is using my rake to draw Snoopy in my pebble garden. "So,Kibo, why the heck do you have all these pebbles filling up a perfectlygood wading pool?"    "Raking the pebbles is a task which accomplishes nothing. The goalis to clear the mind by doing nothing."    "Um, hey, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't `doing nothing' doingsomething? So by doing nothing, you're doing something, thereforeyou're not accomplishing the nothing in the first place! You can't notdo anything."    He is clearly suffering from Buddha called dhiarrhea of the mouth.I say, "You have Bozo-nature."    "Of course. Because if I said I were not a bozo, I would be provingmyself to be a bozo! Now, are you a bozo?"    At that moment, the enlightenment clears from my mind and I devolveto a lower plane of being. "Bob" congratulates me by giving me a wiglike his. We go out for a beer.        "What is the meaning of this story?" asked the novice. "Also, what    is the sound of one hand clapping, and what's a zabuton? Why does Fox    cancel all its shows every season? And why the hell does your Pipe's    stem hover a quarter-inch in front of your mouth?"        "Slack," said the master. "Pure, unadulterated slack. But I lie."        At that moment, the novice dropped dead before finishing this sto
