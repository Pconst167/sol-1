                THE PIPE-SUCKING, GUT-BLOWING ALL NEW NEW AND
                        IMPROVED SLACK QUIZ #1

This is a fairly medium-sized test based on the Purity Test.  Unlike the
Purity Test, which gauges purity (something we could care *less* about),
this measures SLACK!

*ISCLAIMER: This test gives results only roughly representative of the actual
slack of a person.  For the true results, you must learn to whiffread, and
to learn that skill, you must SEND YOUR MONEY to the Church.  Yes, folks,
send that green right in.  But first, send it to ME!  Through E-MAIL!  And
I'll send it for you with my personal blessings.  OR KILL ME!!!!

                        had an original thought since you were born.

-100 to -51:            Go get a lobotomy.  You'll do us all a favor.

-50 to 1:               When the X-ists come, don't bother waiting for a ride.

0 to 49:                You have a little bit of SubG in you, but not much.

50 to 99:               Smoke some 'frop and give me all your money.  You
                        aren't a SubGenius, but at least you can do the rest
                        of us a favor.

100 to 150:             You are beginning to see the light, you just need
                        your butt kicked a little more.

151 to 170:             You are either a) incapable of addition, in which
                        case you're just like every other stupid fool to
                        come out of the public school system, or b) cheating,
                        in which case you've got more slack in you than any
                        of the other poor schmucks who actually added up the
                        score.

I dunno, I printed it
out and smoked it!:     Congratulations, you have slack.  Now give me your
                        money anyway.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you actually bothered to add up the score, congratulations, in spite of
anything said above, you are undeniably pink.  And so is this posting.  And
that's because we all need our slack, and I can't afford to waste any on this
damn system.  So gimme slack, or gimme food, or kill me.  Or not.

Subject: Robert Tilton Ministries
Organization: Knights of Christianity Against Legal Sex

Holy hallelujah and fuckwad, Pee Dog!

One of my Pink acquaintances pointed out a potential ShorDurPerSav for me.
He said:

"Have you watched Reverend Robert Tilton on television?  He's the
hottest up-and-coming T.V. evangelist anywhere.  He doesn't even
bother talking about goodness and such; his main point is that, if you
are poor and send him in $1000 you don't have, God will deposit it
your bank account right after you mail in the letter.  He does all the
wonderful gimmicks; he speaks in tongues, he asks the viewers to place
their hands on the screen, "touching" his, and "feel the energy", and
he brings in people who used to be poor who tell great stories of how
they sent in money to Robert and suddenly found their lives
overflowing with wealth."

So of course I began watching Tilton every day and putting my hand on
the screen along with Robert.  I watched every fake tear, praised his
weekly "miracles."  But it wasn't until I received his prayer book in
the mail that I learned that Robert is, praise "Bob", a SubGenius.

Here's why:

o  He calls himself "Bob" exclusively.  In fact, he doesn't even sign
   his name "Bob Tilton", just "Bob".
o  He understands that ripping off Pinks is the ideal way to make a living.
o  The mail I got from him today is too unbelievably SubG.  I received:

  - "Life-Sized Poster of Me Praying the Prayer of Agreement With You"
  - "Anointing oil"
  - "Prayer of Agreement Seals"
  - "Complete Instructions on How to Receive Your Miracle"
  - "An Illustration of the Life-Changing Vision God Gave Me About The
     Prayer of Agreement and You"
  - A red miracle prayer cloth, made out of the cheapest fabric I've
    ever seen.  He wants you to send it back, even.
  - Three "Miracle envelopes"   (the one for week 1 is pink, by the way)
  - "much more!"

o  Some quotes from the material:

  - "This miracle package has been especially designed under God's
     anointing to meet your toughest miracle needs."
  - "Sign here and join me in faith for your miracle!"
  - "every day for the next 21 days...say out loud `I stand in agreement
     with you, Bob, and believe God for my miracle!'"
  -  "God promises that the truths outlined within this miracle
     package will work for you if you are willing and obedient to act upon
     them.  Get started today on your road to miracles in every area of
     your life!    In Christ Jesus,  Bob"
  -  "Week #1: Bob, please pray over my urgent prayer requests during
      our 21-day miracle campaign."
  -  "I'm not slack, saith the Lord, concerning My promises..."

o  And what's the address of the Robert Tilton Ministries?  It's...

           P.O. Box 819000
           Dallas, TX  75381

   ...right next to Dobbs!

I urge all of you to send off for this free book/poster/oil/prayer
cloth.  For pure slack, this rivals the Stark Fist.

Just write them at the above address, or call (214) 620-6200 and ask
for Bob's free book.  They'll ask you what they can help you pray for.
Tell them you just got a raise and you aren't sure if the money should
go to God or to a new car.  But don't give them your phone number.


Praise Dobbs!  Praise Tilton!  Praise free slack!
