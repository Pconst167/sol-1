     This news article was transcribed during a trance session.  Mr. Ambasgun,
completely zonked on 'Frop [TM] (Trade Name for Hazafropzipulops Herb Blend),
apparently viewed it precognitively during a trance rant at the Chicago chapter
of The Clench of the Stark Fist of Removal.  T_Deacon transcribed the session,
with annotations by T_Rev.
 
 
                 BYRNE AND BYRNE BURN BYRNE, THEN BURN
 
CHICAGO(UPI) - The bodies of famed entertainer David Byrne, comic book writer
John Byrne, and former Chicago mayor Jane Byrne were identified this morning as
apparent victims of a murder-suicide pact at the former site of the 3 Penny
Theatre.  Firefighters were alerted by the theatre's fire alarms almost
immediately, but their attempts to control the blaze proved futile as the
structure burned to the ground.
 
The bodies were found near a locked iron box, which escaped the flames
undamaged.  The box contained old campaign posters, several recent issues of
_Superman_, and Laurie Anderson's album, _Home of the Brave_.  Police
detectives also discovered an encrypted note describing in detail the motive
and means of the murder.  "It appears that John Byrne, in his final effort to
subjugate women, enlisted the aid of the musician in a bizarre plot to protest
women in politics and boost his employer's sagging sales in the comics
industry," said police captain Margaret Sawyer.  On the subject of the
murder/suicide's details, Captain Sawyer explains, "It was a pretty grisly
scene.  We believe that John and David immolated the ex-Mayor, then doused
the theatre with gasoline and set it ablaze, dying on their own pyre."
Preliminary autopsy reports, including dental records, indicate a strong
resemblance between Ms. Byrne and supposedly deceased Chicago political
"Boss" Richard Daley.  Pop psychologist Eric Berne, author of _I'm OK,
You're OK_, was unavailable for comment.
 
The comics and music industries have been badly shaken by the news.  DC Comics
released a statement that performance artist Laurie Anderson will take over
the plotting and scripting of _Superman_.  Many changes are in store for
Anderson's Man of Steel.  Anderson said, "As my new colleague Chris Claremont
pointed out, 'Is there any reason why this character _can't_ be a woman?'
I'll be exploring the implications of this in the months to come."
Aforementioned comics writer Chris Claremont will be taking over David Byrne's
mantle as songwriter/lead singer of the rock group Talking Heads.  "I
believe that the band will be reissuing _Life During Wartime_, and I personally
have an idea for a Jerry Harrison limited series.  Crossover characters will
probably include Wolverine, Kitty Pryde, and Janet Van Dyne.  Also, Louise
[Simonson] has suggested that Power Pack be included."
 
A lead to a possible link between the tragedy and a pornography ring
based in the harbors of Chicago is being pursued.  Any citizens having
relevant infomation should contact the Chicago Police Department.

I'm here to quote various SubGenii sources and do a mini-Rant while waiting for
  Stang or someone to come rant for a while.  Thanks to BoB TeCH (or however
  it's capitalized these days) for the group and the first introductory rant.
  Perhaps someday soon I'll do a real rant, for now though, I'll slack off...
 
"We lie constantly and DO NOT TRICK YOU.  The Conspiracy lies constantly and
 TRICKS YOU.  We talk in absolutely _no-bullshit_ fashion about a FUCKED-UP

              Age of the Yog-Sathoth.
Keywords:
 
I'm afraid there have been some rumours floating around that the Ancient Illumi-
nated Seers of Bavaria have had a hand in 1. Kennedy's Assasination, 2.
George Bush's Public Vomiting, and 3. The Church of the SubGenius founding, and
administration.
        We here at the Jim Jones Cabal would like to get a few things straight
right now. We HAVE NEVER been a part of the JFK assasination, except for
hiring the killers, co-ercing the CIA and the Dallas Police into 'turning the
other way' for us, getting Lee Harvey Oswald to play the part of Dupe and take
the fall for the whole thing, securing the weapons and ammo., getting the
killers into position, hypnotising all of the members of the Warren Commision,
blackmailing Oliver Stone into putting out "JFK" to further cloud the issue,
and coming up with alt.conspiracy so that our little mis-information games
could continue.
        We at the A.I.S.B. however are entirely responsible for the LHO
shooting though. After all, he was the Head Honcho for the Chaos branch of
the A.I.S.B. and we couldn't allow him to remain alive.
        We hope you understand.
        As for George Bush's Public Vomiting, except for one of our Secret
Service contacts slipping a canister full of synthetic Stomach Flu virus
into the Presidential Suite two nights before, we did nothing.
The Flu was synthesized at the POEE's SphincterZone Labs in Umbrage,
Vermintown, Atalantis (which is, BTW, the official name of Atlantis, which
is the commonly used name). We have had the labs check the Prime Minister of
Japan Brother Oliver Stone is hard at work on this one as well.
        The Church of the SubGenius, though, is another bowl of tumours
entirely. The Church has been completely infiltrated by the A.I.S.B. and
is being finely tuned to bring the majority of those identifying themselves
as "the SubGenii", mostly college aged males, into line with official
A.I.S.B. and POEE mindset. Thus, as has been hypothesized before, the Church
of the SubGenius and all of its publications, trademarks, and upper ecshelon
are all Illunminatus puppets. "Bob" himself, who was, according to Jim Jones
files, born in Gary, Indiana in 1403 and 1924, and was killed officially, only
once, on May 23, 1985 (5/23/85 for all you numerology buffs), was first
conceived, in vitrio, in the same SphincterZone Labs.
        The date for X-day; July 5, 1998; has been set, because that is
the day when the Eschaton will be immenantized. On this day, the Illuminati
will return to South America, and the Cracking of the Great Pyramid will
occur, taking all of the Illuminati to the safe havens under the ground.
This is where all of the SubGenius fantasies of the X-ists came from.
Unfortunately, we have already chosen the desirables from the UnFit, so
becoming a card-carrying member is pretty pointless. This doesn't mean,
however, that you should stop sending money; it goes to pay for our
doughnuts.
        Sorry.
