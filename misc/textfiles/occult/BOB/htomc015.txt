** SPECIAL VULKON ISSUE **

  Elements of the 29th Tactical Squadron of the Holy Temple of Mass Consumption
  will be attending the Vulkon convention in Atlanta Ga.  They may be easily
  bribed with large sums of money, real estate, or hot steamy sex.  Miracles,
  dispensations, confessions, and financial advice may be obtained according
  to your personal state of unworthiness, determined individually.

"Bob" Sighting:

  Reported by A.J. Janschewitz <p00258@psilink.com>:

  It seems that some misbegotten system administrator has gotten across the
  fax-on-demand system at a Connecticut state government agency. If you call
  203-297-5698 from a fax machine and tone in 13013 after the recording begins,
  you're prompted to start your fax machine, and after a cover sheet, a
  Picture of the Piped One follows.

New Comix:

  *** Death: The High Cost of Living  1 & 2 of 3
  Spin-off of Sandman, Death spends a day among the living.  Maybe the reason
  she looks like a 16-year old girl has something to do with the average age
  of comic book buyers.  Good story anyway.

  ** Ren & Stimpy in Space (#6)
  Commander Hoek & Cadet Stimpy vs. The Croco-Men from Planet Zed.  Nice
  story, but I don't know how far they can go by reusing old gags from the
  show.  Let's see something original.  Plus, ad-comic ratio is getting bad.

  ***** Cherry's Jubilee #2
  Cherry meets Russian underground classic Octobriana.  Plus, Swede Racer,
  Cherry in space, politics, and more.  Great stuff.

  ***** Cry For Dawn vol. IX
  Same great surreal comics, plus short stories, conspiracy theories, and
  info from the Church of Dawn - videos, books and more available.

  *** The Mishkin File!
  The story of the brilliant early animator Ted Mishkin, and the murals he
  painted as part of his rehabilitation from neurosis.  
   
  *** Simpsons #1
  More adventures of Bart and the other Simpsons.  As twisted as the series,
  the first story also contains veiled references to Ren & Stimpy debacle.

  **** The Hacker Files: Working-Class Hero 1 & 2
  Hacker helps refugees from Tienanmen Square massacre, and gets caught up
  in more intrigue with Digitronix Corp.

Now you've done it.  You've goaded me into posting one of the short
stories I ghostwrote for the Church of the Subgenius(TM).  It's about Zen.

I'd like to point out that I in no way endorse the Church of the Subgenius(TM),
one of the most EVIL organizations in the world.  J. R. "Bob" Dobbs is
the ANTICHRIST and MUST be DESTROYED.  If you meet him on the road, kill
him, then kill yourself, then kill me.

Everything in this story is true.

                        by James "Kibo" Parry
                              (C) 1991

My mantra is "mantra, dammit".
    As I sit here on my zafu (that's a Zen meditation pillow stuffed with
tofu), I reach satori even though I live downstairs from the demolition
derby rink.
    I feel a oneness with the itch in my first chakra. I feel a oneness
with the Pet Rock I used to own. I feel a twoness with myself.
I realize that everything is either something or a hole in something.
Or, perhaps, everything is one big hole and the somethings are holes
within the hole. I shift my weight imperceptibly and the zafu makes a
fart noise.
    Upstairs, two old Trans Ams, surplus from "Knight Rider", collide.
    I can hear the sound of my blood moving through my inner ears. I
realize that everything which exists is made up of little dots arranged
in diagonal rows. A cockroach runs across the floor and into my zafu.
    I realize that "Bob"'s teeth are clenched and his Pipe is not between
them. The teeth are joined and the Pipe ends in front of them. His nose
casts a shadow on the Pipe and the Pipe casts a shadow on his chin but
they do not touch. I have reached enfuckinglightenment!
    As I nearly fall off my zafu, it farts again, blowing the cockroach
into the next room.

      There once was a novice monk named Bho Zho who asked the master, "Does
a house burn up or burn down?"
      The master set fire to the novice's house, after taking all his money.
      As the house burned both up and down, the novice was enlightened.

    I bow to the Sacred Halftone Print of "Bob" to thank him for the
enlightenment. As I do so, "Bob"'s face shimmers and blurs before my
face. All I see is the Dots but not the Smile. All I see is the Smile
without the Dots. I see both. I see neither. I see the hair of Desi
Arnaz, the eyes and mouth of Pee-wee Herman, the jaw of Jay Leno all
combined in a blender: "Bob".
    "Bob" is before me and I am "Bob" and yesterday is tomorrow and I am
the walrus mama dada googoo chihuahuahuahua ommmmmmmmm
    "Yo! Yo! Stop with the satori already!" "Bob" steps out of the
picture, slaps me, and pours himself a Dr Pepper. He sits on my zafu,
which makes a sound like a tuba. I sit on a tatami which is beginning
to sprout. "Bob" looks me in the eye.
    "Cool it with the meditation, guy, it's dull. It's `Bosom Buddies'
without the laughtrack. It's the sound of one lip chapping. It's a
bicycle riding a fish, a steamroller being run over by a birthday cake.
    It just doesn't compare to the fun stuff, especially sex."
I avoid meeting "Bob"'s gaze as I whisper, "He who claims someone does
not have Buddha-nature has no Buddha-nature."
    "Hey, it's easier to say `Slack' than `Buddha-nature', you know. Or
`swellness'. They're all the same thing. You're on a true path to
enlightenment, but true paths have true dirt and true mosquitoes-false
paths are much better. Give me your money now."
    "I have no money, just one zafu, one tatami, my oryoki, this setsu
stick, an inflatable Buddha, a tofu log, all three "Sweatin' to the
Oldies" tapes,  a disposable zabuton, a pile of bulk miso, my
Zen-to-English dictionary."
    "AND A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE!" "Bob" waggles his eyebrows and
smiles. "But seriously, pal, I'll take it all and pretend it's cash
equivalent.  Hey, after I take your zafu, I'll even give you a receipt.
Get it? Re-seat!"
    "Bob" packs all my worldly possessions into his seemingly bottomless
pockets and he leads me out of the monastery. Milliseconds later, a
black Trans Am falls through the ceiling, crashing right where we had
been sitting. It yells insults at us as we walk to the pebble garden.

      "This eggplant in my pocket is like an elephant," said Bhoddyohdor.
      "Yet this elephant in my pocket is like a pair of wax lips," replied
  Tai Dhee Bhoul.
      Just then, Master Rhais Ahroni strolled past. "Tell us," begged
  Bhoddyohdor and Tai Dhee Bhoul, "Is the eggplant like the elephant
  which is like the wax lips, or should we just go watch sitcoms all
  day?"
      The master ate the eggplant, shot the elephant, and got germs on the
  wax lips. The novices were not enlightened. The master laughed.

    "Bob" is using my rake to draw Snoopy in my pebble garden. "So, Kibo,
why the heck do you have all these pebbles filling up a perfectly good
wading pool?"
    "Raking the pebbles is a task which accomplishes nothing. The goal is
to clear the mind by doing nothing."
    "Um, hey, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't `doing nothing' doing
something? So by doing nothing, you're doing something, therefore
you're not accomplishing the nothing in the first place! You can't not
do anything."
    He is clearly suffering from Bhudda called dhiarrhea of the mouth. I
say, "You have Bozo-nature."
"Of course. Because if I said I were not a bozo, I would be proving
myself to be a bozo! Now, are you a bozo?"
    At that moment, the enlightenment clears from my mind and I devolve to
a lower plane of being. "Bob" congratulates me by giving me a wig like
his. We go out for a beer.

      "What is the meaning of this story?" asked the novice. "Also, what is
  the sound of one hand clapping, and what's a zabuton? Why does Fox
  cancel all its shows every season? And why the hell does your Pipe's
  stem hover a quarter-inch in front of your mouth?"
      "Slack," said the master. "Pure, unadulterated slack. But I lie."
  At that moment, the novice's head exploded before he finished this sto
