Review: George Bush at
NC Fairgrounds, 10/21/92

After donning the official fake Press Pass and worming my way onto the press
platform, I had the perfect view of a tired and incoherent G. Bush. At enormous
taxpayer expense, he arrived aboard "The Spirit of America" train (what the
hell was that "Operation Lifesaver" banner on the locomotive?).  The only part
of his 14-minute speech that made any sense at all was the call for a line-
item veto.  Other than that, it was the same old Reagan cheerleading
BEST BANNERS: Clinton supporters who infiltrated the event had signs:
"Re-elect Bush?  Wouldn't Be Prudent."  and "George Bush- The Farewell Tour".
BEST JOKE: goes to Fuhrer Bush himself: "Clinton wants to turn the White House
into the Waffle House."  MOST INTERESTING COMMENTARY: the continuous dialog,
Rocky Horror style, of the reporters on the platform.  The press REALLY does
HATE Bush.  "Annoy the Media, Re-Elect Bush" stickers don't help.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A midterm campaign examination on everything we have learned so far:

1.  Which promise on taxes by George Bush do you find more persuasive?
    a.  His 1988 pledge: "Read my lips.  No new taxes."
    b.  His new, improved 1992 pledge: "I am not going to do it again.
        Ever, ever."

2.  Which action by a college student do you consider more important in
    determining your vote in 1992?
    a.  What Bill CLinton did to avoid getting drafted to fight in a war
        he opposed.
    b.  What Dan Quayle did to avoid getting drafted to fight in a war he
        supported.

3.  In the Great Owl Debate of "jobs vs. environment" posed by the Bush
    campaign, which would be more upset to wake up tomorrow morning and
    find was gone?
    a.  Your job.
    b.  Your planet

4.  Which of the following would you be willing to bet your next paycheck
    that the Vice President of the United States could spell correctly?
    a.  Antidisestablishmentarianism
    b.  Potato
    c.  Cat

5.  What is your favorite family value?
    a.  The right to choose whether to have a family.
    b.  The right to watch "Murphy Brown."
    c.  The Grand Slam Special at Denny's.

6.  Which candidate has the most appeal among young voters?
    a.  Clinton, because he plays that hip musical instrument, the
        saxaphone.
    b.  George Bush, because he talks in rap.
    c.  Al Gore, because he looks like Superman.
    d.  Dan Quayle, because he looks like Jimmy Olsen.
    e.  Ross Perot, because he's an elf.

7.  Bush says the election is about trust.  Which of the following would
    you trust Bush to do if elected to a second term?
    a.  Never to raise taxes again.  Ever, ever.
    b.  To select only the best-qualified Americans for important jobs
        such as the vice presidency and the US Supreme Court.
    c.  Not to throw up on heads of state while visiting other nations.

8.  During the sale of US missiles to Iran, the late Ronald Reagan was
    napping through the presidency and Vice President Bush was "out of the
    loop."  Write your best guess as to who was running the United States.


9.  What is your primary concern about the US economy?
    a.  How to spend the big bonanza if Bush finally succeeds in cutting
        capital gains taxes.
    b.  Whether US jobs are on a fast track or a slow track to Mexico.
    c.  That there be one again.

10. What about George Bush reminds you most of Harry Truman?
    a.  Nobody thinks he's going to win.
    b.  He likes to fish and recently rode on a train.
    c.  He's a dead man.

                        REN AND STIMPY UPDATE

From: Jenny.Lerew%bbs@quake.sylmar.ca.us (Jenny Lerew)

     OK, first let me say that I'm a professional in the animation business
who's been following the posts here for some time with great interest.  My
reason for this is that I know John K. and his core group of artists,
personally as well as professionally.  After the events of a few weeks ago,
John and I were discussing the situation, and I told him about the reaction
of the guys on Usenet.  He was impressed by the action a lot of you said you
were taking on behalf of his show.  I also told him how, with each new
development, rumors were flying re: the reasons for Nickelodeon's yanking
R&S, the future of the series, and whether or not he was going to have any
involvement in it creatively.
     He asked me if I'd post something to clear up a few things. I'm going
to try to be as succinct as possible. First:

        Nickelodeon's claims of *having* to take the show away because of
missed deadlines and going over budget are false.  John had gotten the series
ON TIME.  Nick has just put the show behind by their actions.  As has been
mentioned before, they didn't have to show reruns so early this season--they
did it because they suddenly decided not to air the new episodes they had.
Furthermore, these episodes WERE EXACTLY THE SAME, SHOT FOR SHOT, AS THE
STORYBOARDS THEY'D APPROVED MONTHS AGO, so Spumco WAS NOT pulling a fast one
on Nick, as some have said.  I know, since I saw the boards, *and* Nick's
notes on those boards, and the finished show.  So why they got cold feet--
who knows?

     As for the budget: When Nick took the show from John/Spumco, all they
got was Bob Camp and some drawings.  No equipment, no space, and NO staff...
as I write this Nick has opened a new, expensive office for Bob Camp, they
still need to buy everything to go in it, plus they have a standing offer to
Spumco's artists to "go over" and work there for a big increase in salary.
Sound like they're worried about the budget to you?  Incidentally, not one
of the important artists that drew/wrote Ren & Stimpy have taken them up on
that offer.  These are people who work in a currently tight market, who have
house payments and (some of them) kids to feed.  No sir, they won't do it.

      Some of the best work John & Co. has ever done might never be seen, as
Nick is NOW slicing and dicing away at the remaining shows, in their various
stages of completion.  John is not going to allow his name to go on these
shows, so be warned.  When I heard that John had been made a "consultant" on
R&S, I asked him what that meant.  What it means, folks, is NOTHING.  It's
PR on Nickelodeon's part, to calm down all the angry fans they've been
hearing from.  Unless John has the creative control that got the series
conceived in the first place, he won't involve himself.  Anything less would
amount to WAY too much less.

    The question is: do you want to see the shows listed in FILM THREAT the
way they were intended to be seen, done by an artist who has been killing
himself to perfect them?  Or will you settle for a vastly inferior version,
as Nickelodeon thinks, plans and hopes smugly that you will?

Bob Camp, to put it mildly, is out of his depth as the "head" of production
of Ren & Stimpy.  If he *does* somehow manage to eke out the shows, the
shows will suffer for it.  It's entirely possible that when Nick sees
disaster looming, they'll realize their mistake and go back to the source
for help.

    If any of you think *that* would be a nice turn of events-- if you know
that the reason this show exists is Spumco--John and the rest of his loyal
cartoonists--then let Nickolodeon know.  Don't be snowed by the company
line.  Tell them you know the difference between the real thing and a
corporate, plastic changeling they would put in its place, if they can get
away with it.

BTW, the "inside dope" about John directing a Rescue Rangers movie
for Disney is pretty funny to John.  Where do these things come from?

 [Picture of      About Andre Marrou, the Libertarian Presidential Nominee
  Andre Marrou]   Andre Marrou is a graduate of MIT and has worked as an
                  engineering manager.  Marrou was elected in 1984 to the
                  Alaska State Legislature where he introduced legislation
                  to limit the size of government and reduce taxes.  In 1988
                  Marrou was the LP vice-presidential nominee and running
                  mate of Congressman Ron Paul.


 [Picture of      About Nancy Lord, the Libertarian Vice-Presidential Nominee
  Nancy Lord]     Nancy Lord has degrees in medicine and law and is an
                  attorney specializing in medical-legal and constitutional
                  issues.  As a businesswoman Lord could see first-hand
                  how taxation and bureaucratic regulation were stifling
                  entrepreneurship; this sparked her decision to run for
                  mayor of Washington, D.C. in 1990.

                       Andre Marrou and Nancy Lord
                   1992 Libertarian Presidential Ticket


 The Libertarian Party
 is the Party of the future.  The LP is America's third largest and
 fastest growing party.  It has elected over one hundred candidates,
 and in 1990 polled over five million votes.

 A Party of Principle
 The LP has always stood for personal freedom and self responsibility.
 No Libertarian has ever raised your taxes or increased government spending.
 In fact, Libertarians have stopped or repealed taxes, including the Alaska
 income tax.

 Libertarian Ideas are American Ideas
 The Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights are libertarian
 documents.  We believe, as the Founders did, that people must be left
 free to live their own lives, must be responsible for their own actions,
 and must not harm others.  The only just role for government is to defend
 use against force and fraud.  The Constution and Bill of Rights limited
 government to that role, but the politicians have gone beyond those limits.

 The LP Challenges *US* to Fight Back
 A 3% tax led The Founders to rebel against England.  Now our taxes are
 nearly 50%.  This money is wasted.  The government gives billions to
 foreign governments, millions more to farmers who grow no food, thousands
 to cover Congressional bounced checks.  They've even given millions to
 both tobacco farmers *and* campaigns against smoking.

        THE LP HAS A BETTER WAY

 The Libertarian Way
 Let's stop giving billions to foreign governments, millions to farmers
 who grow no food, thousands for Congressional privilege, and millions
 more to tobacco companies.  Let's make government do its real job -
 *keep our streets safe and our land defended*.

 What if your bill for government went from 50% of earnings to 10% or less?
 What if your spendable income nearly doubled?  What would your life be
 like?  What causes would you support?  What could you do for your children?

 *Nothing is free*.  The government's supposed free services cost dearly.
 You pay for waste and political favors.  Get more for your money.  Confine
 government to the protection of your safety, and both your safety and your
 wealth will grow.  We'll have safe streets, a strong economy, and the
 money we need to give our children the education they deserve.

 That's the Libertarian Way -you choose-
 government waste and inefficiency, or safety and abundance for you
 and your family?

 To help build this responsible alternative to the old parties,
 call or write...
