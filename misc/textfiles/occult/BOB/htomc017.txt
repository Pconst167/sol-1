NEWS since the last time:

 SUCCESSFUL gut blow-out at the Jonestown (After Dark) party in Room 773
 at the Magnum Opus Convention.  Easily the most slack-filled place on the
 North American continent while it lasted, with special "potion", go-go
 dancers, and the TWISTER TOURNAMENT, with enough Euro-trash gothic industrial
 muzak to peel the paint off the walls.  The punch was NOT spiked with codeine,
 as verified by local police, but guests grew 2-7 extra appendages.

condoning Dahmer in any way whatsoever, many people got upset *just because
it happens to be in comic book format*, without even reading it.  It lead to a

     "David Koresh had warned
      that anybody trying to harm
      him would be "devoured by
      fire."  In the end, it was he
      who died in the flames."

Or so the Conspiracy Media tells us.            [Picture showing how
What precisely was the nature of the             Koresh made his escape]
meeting between J.R. "Bob" Dobbs and
David Koresh 2 years ago?  Despite
unofficial spottings of Koresh at a
7-11 in Minnesota, rumors abound that
the compound in Waco Texas was merely
a training exercise for Koresh, who
has been appointed the new Security
Chief for the Dobbstown Compound.

****************************************************************************


      Posessed, as I am, by the FIRES of enLIGHTenment, I must Proclaim unto
 the Five Corners of the Firmament, the Limbic Storm Intensity REVELATION
 that I just experienced while doing the dishes. WAAAAAAA...HOOOOOOOO!!!! I
 Shout it from the Rooftops, Scream it from the Ladders, Yell it at the Top
 of my Lungs while I'm in the back seat of the Holy Police Squad car, and
 Whisper it to my cellmates while I await my arraignment! SCREW my
 Arraignment! This is my Enlightenment!
      I tell you know of the Three Part Partial Cosmology of the
 Philosopher-King. I say Three-Part because that's how many parts I know of
 through the Crystal Diamond Bolt of Zero-sum Knowledge placed in my skull
 by the _Object from Space_! I say partial because I'm sure there's more,
 and I'll learn about THEM once I gt my head screwed into the fundaMENtal
 truths of the Three Part Cosmology. I say Cosmology because THESE FORCES
 RULE the UNIVERSE, or at least this particularly deranged part of it.
      Here are the Three Parts, that which once reigned over even "BOB," but
 now vie with him for Power and Dominion. They are: the Object from Space,
 the Communist Munchkins from the Center of the Earth, and the Fungi from
 Yoggoth! Eah has his role unto the Cosmos, and each shall be described upon
 this BBS. Yes, the Revelation is here-- through the beneficience of the
 Object from Space, flawlessly uploaded thanks to the benevolence of the
 Communist Munchkins, and posted even while under the watchful Purple Gaze
 of the Fungi from Yoggoth.
      So okay, it's still dropping letters when it word-wraps. The Munchkins
 aren't that slack.
      The Object from Space is that being which bestows madness upon a
 select few. The Object is clearly above constraints of good or bad,
 because, although many receive madness, some go bad, others go good. Mass
 murderers are the unlucky victims of the Object's Bad Karma. (Well, okay,
 their victims have it worse.) Those killers who talk or write strangely,
 like Manson or Jack the Ripper, are obviously touched by the fickle finger
 of the Object. There is a sick wisdom that may be gleaned here. The
 Ayatollah Khomeini, trapped in his delusions of power, is but a blind pawn
 of the Object, which guides him not. Warped visonaries are everywhere.
      On the other hand, there is much good in the Object, for its madness
 also gives us the blazing insight and unrestrained joy of pure creative
 genius. When Chuck Berry does his duckwalk, or when James Brown is onstage,
 they are receiving the Good side of the Object from Space, and this is
 Always a Holy Moment. When you see John Belushi doing his Samurai, that is
 the Object. Sam Kinison's screams come from the Object. George Carlin is a
 Saint, who has taken the touch of the Object and translated it into
 continuing rational insight. Epopt Illuminatae of the Object from Space
 include Little Richard, John Lennon, Salvador Dali, Lenny Bruce, Harlan
 Ellison, the staff of the 1972-1974 National Lampoon, William Burroughs,
 Buckminster Fuller, and Edgar Allan Poe.
      The Communist Munchkins from the Center of the Earth are more commonly
 knows as gremlins. Sullen imps of the netherworld, it's their job to fuck
 things up. When Saint John's disks crash, it's the fault of the Munchkins.
 The Iran-Contra affair was th Munchkins' work. The PTL Club was theirs
 since 1970. Airplane crashes, hangnails, false alarms at SAC,
 bacteriological warfare spills, and the Sargeant York tank are all theirs.
 A truly paranoid element, and it is impossible to trace ANY kind of method
 to their work. I think they do it because they have fun.
     The Fungi from Yoggoth is a pale, sickly yellow that reminds one of
 old, curdled fat. The Fungi from Yoggoth is manifested when an aging,
 decript system or individual tries to keep power in its hands, and away
 from the young, vital and intelligent. It's stagnation, pure and simple,
 the entropic heat-death of the Universe in the face of the ongoing struggle
 for life. Ronald Reagan, Frank Rizzo, Jerry Falwell, Jesse Helms, Tipper
 Gore and the PMRC, the staff of the National Review, Norman Podhoretz, and
 the Central Intelligence Agency are all manifestations of the Fungi from
 Yoggoth. Your high school principal. In the entertainment world, it's Frank
 Sinatra, Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, Buddy Hackett, Joey Heatherton, Sammy
 Davis, Jr., Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope (especially Bob Hope), Jan Murray and
 Jack Carter. In short, everyone who wouldn't want to get hit by Robert
 Crumb's Meatball.

      The best example of this is the loudspeaker voice at the University
 City Thriftway, the one that says, 'Choppers, over in our Seafood
 department, we now sell whale meat, only a dollar forty a can!'
      Beware the Fungi from Yoggoth, because it can make you part of It. It
 drains the exuberance and creativity of youth, my friends. It is that which
 denies you SLACK, and it should be avoided at ALL costs!

(A question was raised concerning how exactly this ties in with Brainsucking.)

My three part cosmology ties in with brainsucking as follows. The Object from
Space bestows upon people the necessary madness to recognize the
intelligence-expanding properties of brain sucking. The Communist Munchkins
make sure that the equipment you buy to do it fucks up. (I tried using an
Electrolux vacuum on a chemistry major once-- yike! I flunked the chem final I
had the next day, too.) And the Fungi from Yoggoth will prevent you from
sucking the brains of others by telling you LIES!
        You see, the Fungi from Yoggoth is very clever. First, it will lie to
you about the consequences. Then, when you finally try it, it will make sure
that the Brain you Suck will have a lower than average intelligence; or, it
may be under the influence of th Fungi from Yoggoth! One quick suck of THAT and
WHOOSH! there goes all of your youthful vim and vigor, to be replaced by the
dull yellow oppression of teh Fungi from Yoggoth.
        I will attest to the healing properties of select Bob Dylan. I also
recommend "Subterranean Homesick Blues," from the same album.
        As for Bon Jovi, I would either define him as False Object from Space,
or an undiscovered part of the cosmology. (Although I lke Springsteen, the
same thing applies-- he has no place in the discovered portions of the
Cosmology. However, what lies undiscovered may be Good, and he'd definitely
fall into that catgory.)
        Definite rockers from the Object from Space also include Devo, the Sex
Pistols, early Clash, Creedence, and Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.
(Especilally the last two!)

                 The True Story of Jim Morrison Part One

     In Which we learn of Dangerous Beings Who try (but fail) to stop
                             Rock'n'Roll


                          The Introduction

     The moon's crimson light illuminated a ghastly scene.  Jim Morrison
peered from his hiding place and his stomach got all mushy inside like
when you've eaten something really greasy and washed it down with Jolt [TM]
or when you've got a real bad crush on somebody and you think 'well, maybe
they like me' but you're not sure enough to do anything about it and
you're not unsure enough to write them off but in any case really gurgly
at the sight in the clearing below.
     What he saw was this:
     Three disembodied heads with blood oozing from where their necks should
be, wailing and foaming at the mouth and floating about and mouthing old
'Three Stooges' routines, but the most horrible thing about them was that
they were the heads of CURLY, SHEMP, and JOE!!!
     Eight two-headed black goats with glowing red eyes and green hooves.
     A flying cloud of vomit.
     Dan Quayle.
     A red-skinned dwarf with six-inch tusks.
     The assembled figures were dancing around a giant trout suspended in
mid-air in the middle of the clearing.  He noticed several nethack ghosts
scattered around the clearing.
     So astounded was he by this insane literary collage that he did not
notice when Dan Quayle, who had merely projected his astral form into
the clearing as a distraction, hit him over the head with the printout of
a month's worth of alt.slack messages from the fall of 1987.

     When he awoke, six months later, he was on a spaceship bound for
Sirius, a pipe in his mouth and an alien computer in his brain.
