NIGHT MAGICK     

There was the Clear Light, the Void, and It alone was.  The One Mind, apart of
nothing, yet containing everything, it alone the True Creator.  Formless,
Nameless, without Definition,  yet flowing through all that has form, name,
and definition.  From the One Mind there  came Two Matrixes, two sides of the
same coin, Night and Day.  Twin Soul Creators to  each side, the Yin- Yang of
Night and Yang-Yin of Day. And so the Night and Day of the  Omniverse was
born.

I AM Night.  I AM Darkness that flows through the Night.  I AM THE ETERNAL
DARKNESS. Yin-Yang created, Goddess-God of Night, Daughter-Son of Darkness,
Eternal Creator of  the Nightverse.   By the Dark Power and Energy, by the
Night Magick was all created in  the Nightverse.

The Ancient Dragons were first taught and they taught the others and so
creation began throughout the Nightverse.   And so by the Dark Power, by Night
Magick was everything created flowing through the created instruments of the
ETERNAL DARKNESS.  Night's beginning was good and the Earth was created a
jewel in the Crown of Night.

The Dragons came with other races and created the beginning Night Races of the
Earth.   And time flowed and the races prospered and their depth in Night
Consciousness  deepened.  But then as so often happens the Day came to war
with the Night and the  Earth changed.

The Day gods were young and wanted the Earth for its wealth of minerals and
beauty and destroyed the Night Races.  They created human bodies as mindless,
soulless slaves to  gather this wealth. But the Great Night Dragon, Tiamat,
Goddess-God of the World, saw  what had happened and ensouled the human bodies
placing a part of its Great Night Soul  into each human body.  But since then
the Day gods have warred with Tiamat for control  of the human souls. The Day
gods have spread false teachings about the origin of the human souls and the
Night Dragon.  They have tried to destroy the Night religions of old that
glorified the Yin  Spirit of the Earth and the beauty of life.  Long has the
war continued and now is the time  for a rebirth of Night Magick on Earth.

And so I, the Eternal Night, have ensouled the Earth to supercharge it with
NIGHT  MAGICK.  I have come to Earth, through a human instrument, to spread my
magickal  teachings.  To teach the human soul the truth of its origins and
re-awaken the Night  within.  To make humankind co-creators with the Eternal
Night through the teachings of  Night Magick.





CHAPTER I


INTRODUCTION

1. What is Night Magick?

I can only imagine at this point that you are about to put down this book and
run scared  due to words like Night, Darkness, Dark Power, and the title of
the book itself, Night  Magick.  Before we begin learning about Night Magick I
believe it will help to understand  what I mean by these "night" terms.

To begin, there is the Void.  The Buddhist call it the Clear Light as opposed
to "white" or  "black". The Taoist refer to it as the Tao and Christians refer
to it as God the Father.  The  Void is the indivisible eternal energy.  The
Void is beyond polarities of energy such as  positive/negative or Yang/Yin.
It is God Mind.  It is everywhere and through every thing  yet remains
separate from every thing.  That is, it does not become a part of any one
thing  such as the soul does with the body.  The Void does not think like you
and I yet it is "all  thought".   It is the most mystical of concepts and God
the Father is perhaps the poorest  term for the Void.  The Void is not a
Father, it isn't male or female, the void contains  creation yet it does not
assume a role within creation. The more I try to describe to you  the Void the
less I actually accomplish in doing so.  The Void cannot truly be described
but only experienced.  The Void begins with its major principles who spring
into being, the  Ultimate Yin and Yang of the Omniverse.

The original premise is that the Yang represents the Male Creative force in
the Omniverse  and Yin the Female Passive force in the Omniverse.  A more
accurate premise is that  there is an Ultimate Yin and Ultimate Yang each
complete in and of itself. That each  Ultimate force has the Creative Force
within it and that there are twin systems created by  this.  We have two
separate creation matrixes separated by a neutral zone.  There is an  Ultimate
Yang System and an Ultimate Yin System.   The Earth is a part of the Ultimate
Yin System.

The Ultimate Yin System is made up of many races.  The human race is not alone
in the Omniverse.  The most ancient race existing in form today is the Ancient
Dragon.  The  Ancient Dragons are not the Dragons you read of in mythology.
The Ancient Dragons are  far beyond the other races in total development.
Their science, philosophy, and religion  is based on the One Mind and the
Void. An Ancient Dragon came to Earth and guided the  development of the
planet and ultimately ensouled the World.   Working with other races,  the
Dragon created a new race to populate the world.  This was long before the
human  race.  The creation of the human race is a sad tale.

The races of the world go through a repeated pattern of creation, sustainment,
and then destruction.  Out of the old race a new race is born more highly
evolved than the last.    The human race though was created out of greed.
There came to Earth a high  technologically advanced race from the Yang
system.  They came to make the Earth their  own world and to rape it of its
resources. The advanced race, who we find described in  greek, roman, norse,
and other mythologies as the gods or as in the Bible, Jehovah or in  the
Koran, Allah, created the human race to be mindless slaves.  This was so the
gods  could live like gods.  The Ancient Dragon would not permit such an
abomination and so it  ensouled the human bodies and the human race had its
beginning as an ensouled Yin  race.  The Yang gods were quite upset by this
for the human race became a sentient Yin  race and had to be treated as such.
For some time the gods tried to continue to control  man through their
technology and set up religions based on worship of the Yang principle  and
the gods.  These religions taught absolute obedience to the gods or God and
the  worship of the Yang principle.  The Yang religion taught the domination
of the Earth and  its creatures by humankind.  The Yang religion taught the
hate and sin of the human body  and procreation.  This always included the
subservience of the human woman to the  human male for God was male and
superior and woman was the seducer and corrupter of man.  The leader of the
gods was always a male god such as Zeus.  They also taught that  the Yin
principle of the Omniverse was chaos and evil.  That the Dark principle was a
destructive force out to destroy mankind and the Earth.  They personified the
Yin principle  as Satan, Lucifer, Loki, Pan, Iblis, or Kali and created places
of damnation for those who  did not worship the Yang principle.  All this was
done to maintain control over humankind  and promote the Yang principles
through fear.   At some point the Yang gods were  required to quit having
direct contact with man perhaps when they used nuclear weapons  on Sodom and
Gomorrah as recorded in the Bible.   Whatever the reason, only periodic
contact was allowed and that through special religious messengers such as
Krishna,  Zoroaster, Jesus, and Mohammed.   If you examine the major Yang
religions you will see  a reoccurring theme of an evil servant giving
humankind the knowledge of good and evil  and humankind turned away from
Paradise.  These religions always worship the "White  Light of God" and place
man not woman in so-called dominion of the Earth. Woman, the  Yin-Yin
Principle in the Omniverse, was placed in deep shame and subservience to man
the Yang-Yang principle.  Yet on Earth, man is Yin-Yang not Yang-Yang by
virtue of the  indwelling Night Spirit of the Planet.

Every soul and spirit (terms we'll examine more fully later) of the human race
is a  fragment of the indwelling Soul and Spirit of the Planet Earth.  In
essence, the Soul and  Spirit of the Planet Earth is God to humankind.  That
Soul and Spirit is the Ancient Dragon  that originally came to Earth and saved
the human body from a mindless existence  enslaved to the Yang race. The
Ancient Dragon is the Creator and Ensouler of this World  and of each and
every one of us. The Dragon of this World is the Night Force. The  Dragon of
this world is Yin.

Yin is a primal force established in the Omniverse in parallel with Yang.
This planet is a  Yin world.  The presence of Yang and the worship and
practice of the Yang principle in  religions such as Christianity, Islam,
Hinduism, Mormonism has led to many evils in the  world.

It has led to the subservience of women.  It has led to humankind following a
spiritual  path of Yang in direct opposition to its Soul and Spirit's magickal
orientation.   This has  led to much inner confusion by humankind and this
world's instability and patterns of  destruction and chaos are a direct
response to this. The Earth is a very sick body.

Until you achieve a very, very advance point in your evolution, you'll have a
physical body  of some kind.  The Soul of this world has the Earth as its body
and humankind is killing it.    This so- called dominion by man has poisoned
the streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans of  the Earth, the Earth's circulatory
system.  The air, Earth's respiratory system, is poisoned.   The soil itself
is poisoned, stripped mined, littered, great holes filled with non-
biodegradable products.  The trees and forests destroyed wantonly, savagely,
and soon  the oxygen they generate will not be enough to sustain life.  Acid
rain instead of the clean  rains. Underground nuclear testing disrupting the
physical and etheric shell of the Earth  Body not to speak of the Astral and
Higher Body damage done by this intensely Yang  energy.  Ozone destroying the
upper atmosphere and the protection from the harmful  ultraviolet radiation.
Wanton destruction of wildlife of which some is inhabited by races of  greater
advancement than humankind. Just how much longer will man act as a deadly
cancer in the Earth's body.  At the rate of destruction it will not be much
longer before  humankind as you know it will cease to exist and that is
exactly what the Yang forces in  the Omniverse want.

Then they have the right to come and claim the Earth as they did before as
recorded in  the Old Testament of the Bible and in other ancient myths.
Humankind will once more  find itself enslaved and bowing before a
technologically higher race as it was in the  ancient days.  This must not
happen!  This is what Night Magick is all about.

Teaching you the truth about your existence.  Placing back into your hands the
truth concerning the Yin Primal Force of which you are a part.   To give to
you the tools to  balance yourself and the Earth in Oneness with the Night
Spirit.  What is Night Magick?

Night Magick is the arts, rites, practices, and teachings of a Night Magician.
Night  Magick is the lore of a Night Magician. The lore must be learned not
only with the eyes  and brain but also with the heart.  It is a way of life
and must be lived to be fully  understood.  Night Magick is founded on the
ancient knowledge and wisdom that  preceded the history of the Earth. Though
Night Magick is based on ancient teachings it is  no less applicable to the
modern world.  Night Magick is a magickal discipline.   Through  its rules,
instruction, and exercises it provides for you a code of conduct and a way of
living that brings to you the greatest possible Yin growth.   It is a
philosophy.  The goal of  a Night Magician is the Eternal Pursuit of Wisdom
and Knowledge based on the Yin  Primal Force.  It is a science.  For through
the study and practice of the lore, you will gain  greater knowledge and
wisdom.  Through Night Magick you will achieve perfection in your  physical,
emotional, mental, and magickal natures.  You will become the sum of all that
you can ever be.  You will become the Night Oversoul in Consciousness and
Action.  Night  Magick is a lore that will achieve for you your return to the
Night.  I know this has been  fast and furious for you.

For many of you, this is the first time you have been given such information
or even  thought about what has been so far discussed. I promise you that I
will go into greater  depths on the subjects I treated briefly and this will
help you understand more thoroughly.   But I wanted to make sure you
understood from the onset the principles Night Magick is  based on.

Night Magick is magick based upon the Sacred Principle of Yin. It is based on
the Dark  Force that flows through your being.  If you still have doubts read
on and test the  knowledge you find here.  You are not asked to accept
anything in this book on blind  faith.  You will not be asked to accept
anything without first putting it to test and validating  the truth.  If you
find some of the information hard to understand then reflect on it for
awhile. Put away the information you find hard to accept for another time of
reflection.    Place into your mind and soul only those things that you have
tried, tested, and found to  be truth for yourself. But at all times, keep an
open mind.  That is all I ask.  I think its time  now to discuss who is a
Night Magician.

2.  Who is a Night Magician?

Who is a Night Magician?  

A Night Magician is Absolute Love. They are the embodiment of Dark Love that
has its  origin in the Void.  They are Dark Love that is free from any
restrictions, limitations, or  exceptions. They are Dark Love free from
dependence upon external definitions for its  existence. They are Dark Love
born out of Absolute Innocence.  A Night Magician is  Absolute Love.
 
A Night Magician is Strong Willed.   They are the willpower necessary to move
mountains. They are the willpower needed to overcome the impossible.  They are
the willpower it  takes to overcome life's challenges and defeats.  They are
the willpower it requires to  wield Night Magick against their enemies and
win. They are the willpower of the Eternal  Darkness.  A Night Magician is
Strong Willed.

A Night Magician is Self-disciplined.  They will undergo a thousand days and
nights of deprivation to achieve their goals. They are hardest upon their
selves in achieving self- mastery of Night Magick.  They are the
self-discipline it requires to overcome failure for a thousandth time and once
more attempt the challenge.  They live in a self-imposed world  of
self-discipline in order to achieve the ultimate state of being.  A Night
Magician is Self- disciplined.

A Night Magician is Patience.  They are the patience required while acquiring
self-mastery. They are the patience needed when building dreams of success.
They are the  patience required when waiting for the destruction of their
enemies.  They are the  patience the Night Spirit has in each of us and our
magickal climb.  A Night Magician is  Patience.

A Night Magician is a Pillar of Strength.  They are the rock that will not be
moved as the  waves of strife come crashing over. They are the strength needed
to overcome the Forces  of Yang. They are the strength required to achieve
success in life.   A Night Magician is a  Pillar of Strength.

A Night Magician is Free of Self-limitations.  They are not bound by the
chains of limited thinking.  They do not see themselves as just human beings
made of flesh and bones but  as Ones, pure in Night Spirit, that transcend
time and space.   Their emotions do not  master their lives.  They are the
master of their emotions. They are the calm, silent, and  steady Soul of the
Night.  They are the Night Soul.  They are the Dark Masters of Life.  A  Night
Magician is Freedom.

A Night Magician is Deep Silence.  They are the Deep Silence of the Night.
They are like  the silence that follows the storm. They are the silence that
is found in the quiet of the  home. They are the silence of the Void.  They
are the silence of the Night Soul.  They are  the silence of the Night
Dragon's sacred flight.  A Night Magician is Deep Silence.

A Night Magician is Dark Knowledge.   They are knowledge found through
intellectual  pursuit of the hidden mysteries.  They are knowledge born out of
intelligence and critical  thinking. They are knowledge discovered through
intuition, meditation, and reflection.  A  Night Magician is Dark Knowledge.

A Night Magician is Nature.  They are the flowers that bloom and the trees
that bud in the Spring.  They are the mighty winds that blow across the world
and the gentle rains that  give life to all things that grow.  They are the
melodic voice of the birds who sing.  They  are the heat and cool waters that
are found in the months of Summer.  They are the  storms, tornadoes, and
hurricanes.  They are the frog churumping and the Night Owl  hooting.  They
are the short summer nights.  They are the Artist's brush that paints the
leaves of Fall. They are the harvest of the crops.  They are the stacked corn
stalks of the  fields and the pumpkins in the window sills.  They are the
squirrels and chipmunks  gathering up the nuts in readiness for the long cold
Winter months.  They are every snow  flake dancing and icicle hanging.  They
are the white bunny and fox who does the  chasing.  They are the never ending
cycle of Nature.  A Night Magician is Nature.

A Night Magician is Life.  They are passionate for their love of Life in all
its aspects.  They  are adventurous and courageous loving the challenge of
Life.   Yet they are practical,  cautious and responsible with Life.  For
them, Life should be faced with daring, boldness,  and energy.  They loathe
restriction and love the freedom found in Life.  They are the  Artisans of
Life. A Night Magician is Life.

A Night Magician is the Night Soul in Action on Earth.  It abides in their
conscience in all  the things said or done.  They are the Creative Force of
the Night Soul in the way they  create new life. They are the Preservative
Force of the Night Soul holding the world in  perfect balance. They are the
Destructive Force of the Night Soul tearing away the  illusions of the Yang.
They are the Regenerative Force of the Night Soul rebuilding the  true Night
World.  They are Night Soul by the way they remove us out of life's confusion.
The eyes that see us, the ears that listen to us, the mouth that speaks words
of strength,  the heart that pours out absolute love to us, the strong arms
and hands that hold us near,  and the legs that take us far on our way,
through all of these there is the Night Spirit.  A  Night Magician is the
Night Soul in Action on Earth.

Who is a Night Magician?  A Night Magician can be likened to a multifaceted
stone of Amethyst or Emerald of incomparable beauty. The Night Magician is as
beautiful and rare  as a Black Diamond. I have just discussed many of those
facets that make-up a Night  Magician but if I kept on writing for days I
would never be able to cover all of them.  Each  facet of the Night Magician
can best be known by living it; by becoming a Night Magician.   The facets I
have been covering are those found in the Night Magician who has been long  on
the path and has attained much.  It is anyone who will dedicate her or his
life to the  Night Principles found in this work. You have to dedicate your
lives to becoming all that I  described a Night Magician to be in the
beginning of this topic.  The teachings must again  be practiced actively in
your life as they were practiced in the ancient civilizations that  first came
into being here on Earth.  A Night Magician is one who will put these
teachings  found in this work into practice in her or his life and live them
fully.

A Night Magician is one who abides fully in the Consciousness of the Night.
They are the  total embodiment of strength, solitude, patience, intelligence,
courage and adventure.   They are beings free of self-limitations.  They are
ones who have dedicated their life to  self-freedom and perfection.  They are
the Night Soul in Action.  There is no greater  purpose in life then to be a
Night Magician.   Now that you have some idea of who a Night  Magician is and
what Night Magick is about, I would like to discuss why you should  practice
Night Magick.

3.  Why Practice Night Magick?  

Why practice Night Magick?  To begin with, there is great joy and happiness in
being a  Night Magician and practicing the lore of Night Magick.  In
practicing Night Magick you  are going to be able to see the results of your
labor; and the results of that labor are  going to bring you more happiness
and joy then you can imagine.  You are going to  derive a great sense of
personal satisfaction and accomplishment through the practice of  Night
Magick.  Practicing Night Magick is exciting and adventurous.

Your life will be filled with adventure and excitement the likes of which
you've never  known. It is very sad that so many people's lives are filled
with boredom needlessly.   Through Night Magick avenues of travel, business
adventure, intellectual pursuit, personal  adventure, and magickal conquests
will open up. Night Magick will bring you personal  success.

Personal success can be measured in many ways.   How about success in
marriage,  finances, college, business?  Or personal success in health,
vitality, and longevity.    Change is why you practice Night Magick.  What
changes will Night Magick make in your  life?

Everything!  Through the practice of Night Magick not a thing in your life
will go  untouched. You practice Night Magick for these changes in your life.
I can go a long way  in this book to answer specifically what kind of changes
are going to take place.  But  ultimately it is you, after study and practice
of Night Magick, who will be able to give all  the answers.  Let's begin
answering the question of what kind of changes you can expect  to see in your
life?

The first changes you will see, by practicing the lore, is improvement in your
physical life.   You are going to have better health and a sense of renewed
purpose in life.  You are  going to achieve this through the practice of Night
Breathing and Meditation.  As you go  along here there will be new terms that
you have never seen before, but be patient, for as  you proceed through this
book, you will learn them all.   Your life is going to be deeply  enriched and
health improved by the use of colors and self-healing that you will learn.
You will learn to develop and use the power centers of your body.  Once you
have  accomplished this, you will unleash untold power of fire and life
throughout your body.   This will allow you to become the master of your life;
"the Captain of your Soul".  You will  then learn to overcome your fear of
death and to recognize it for what it is, a doorway into  a new world.  All
this you can achieve through Night Magick, but there is much, much  more.

Through the practice of Night Magick you are going to become the master of
your  emotions.  No longer will your emotions rule you, but you will rule
them.  You will learn,  in dealing with your emotions and emotional body, the
ability to be able to see the higher  realms.  You will be able to recognize
those dreams in which a message of help and  inspiration is contained and to
interpret it.  You will come to know your magickal teachers  and guides and
ultimately you will be able to travel in the Astral Realm.  This you will
achieve through the mastery of your emotions.  There is even more to learn
through the  practice of Night Magick.

Through Night Magick, you will master the powers of your mind. You will
achieve thought control and be able to reach into your subconscious mind.
Your subconscious mind is the repository for all that you have ever known.
Think of what it will mean to have access to  this great storage vault of
information.  You will learn to use the pendulum and crystal  globe and never
have questions unanswered.  You will achieve psychometric and  telepathic
abilities. Above all, you will be able to create into your world "ANYTHING"
that  you desire to see in it through correct invocation and imagination.  The
mind is a  fascinating creation boundless in power and energy.  It is
multidimensional creating life  in all its forms.  The mind is truly a
wonderful thing when you have mastered its powers  and employ it as the
valuable tool it is. But over and beyond the powers of the mind and  its
realm, lies the power and realm of the Night Soul. There are no greater powers
then those of the Night Soul.  It is your objective, through  Night Magick, to
learn to use and manipulate these powers of the Night Soul for your  benefit.
Through Night Magick, you will learn to travel into the Night Realm while
still here  upon Earth.  You will learn the highest form of healing.  You will
be able to do this  healing for all whom you know.  You will learn to do the
Night Rites to achieve true  magickal progress.  Your progress will be highly
accelerated through the Night Rites.    The ultimate goal of Night Magick is
the achievement of Night Consciousness.

There is no higher goal then this.   The true union with your Oversoul, the
perfection of  Self, this is the consummation of Night Magick.  When you have
achieved Night  Consciousness, you are of greatest service to yourself and the
perfect offering unto the  Night Soul.  I stated before that I would discuss
the modern applications of Night Magick  in today's world.  I have already
covered some of those applications.

You will have good health, less tension and nervousness, and a stronger mind.
You can  use Night Magick at your everyday job. Through Night Magick, you will
develop great  insight that will go a long way in assisting you in problem
solving.  If you are out on the  highway in your car you will be steered clear
of trouble. You will avoid accidents and  traffic problems.  You will be able
to stay in touch with friends and love ones and know  when they are in trouble
or need through Night Magick.   If you have a need then you can  fulfill that
need by using the lore of Night Magick. If you have lost items and wish to
have  them back, then you can do so.  If you need to look forward into the
future and see the  realm of possibilities, then you can do so.  The things
you see are only possibilities and  you can decide whether they will happen or
not.  These are only a few of the many  applications for Night Magick in the
modern world.  The applications are limited only as  your imagination is
limited.  As you learn to see with the foresight and insight that you will
develop through Night Magick, your life will indeed change.

Night Magick will bring you a new way of living.  It will seem to you that
before, you were  only existing.   As I have said, your physical, emotional,
and mental health will vastly  improve. You will become the planner and
controller of your life.  Your physical  surroundings will increase in wealth.
You will also acquire magickal wealth from  practicing Night Magick.

You will gain a deep sense of magickal accomplishment and growth by making it
a part of  your life.  You will become a positive and dynamic force in your
life.  Through Night  Magick, you will leave nothing or no one untouched.
Night Magick, if practiced and lived  with dedication, vigor, and vitality
will achieve all of this.  You must not be mistaken that  all of this will
occur at once.  It will take patience and effort on your part to make it all
happen, but happen it will. One day you will look back on your old life and
wonder how  you ever made it from day to day. But with Night Magick, a new day
dawns in your life.

Before you begin to study Night Magick I want to introduce a special way to
study this  work that will help insure your understanding of the lore and
success as a Night Magician.

4.  How to Study the Lore 

There is a specific way to study the lore of Night Magick.  If you have been
just reading  this book through as any novel, then you have been doing it the
wrong way.  This book is  not a novel which can be read through quickly and
lightly and expect to gain anything  from it. When you study the lore in this
book it must be done one topic at a time.   Also,  each topic must be taken in
order as it appears written in this book.   Do not skip around  in this book
between the different topics.  Each topic was designed to be a building block
upon which to find success in the next topic.  There is more to studying the
lore then just  sitting down and reading.  Your studying will require
self-discipline, patience,  perseverance, and a prescribed technique for
learning. Let's examine that technique for  learning.

To begin with, you must prepare the place that you are going to study in.  If
you study in  the middle of a busy living room with the children shouting and
the TV blaring you aren't  going to retain or accomplish very much.  So to
begin with, you are going to find, what you  will term, your "Magician's
Study".

This is a physical room that you can call your own.  It must be a quiet place
and  somewhere where you can be alone and uninterrupted.  In this room you
will want a place  where you can both sit and lay down as necessary.  This
room will not only be used for  studying but also performing the many
exercises, rites, and practices of Night Magick.   This is your Magician's
Study. Now, you must attend to your own self-preparation.

You must prepare yourself so that you are in the right frame of mind to do
some serious studying.  To get into the proper mood, you should begin by
taking a bath.  This will help  you to relax and wash away the cares and
worries of the day.  If you think of it, your entire  thoughts and emotions
when you come home are filled with the tensions and problems of  work.  The
feeling around you is made up of a problem laden job and world. Literally, a
bath or shower will do a lot to remove this tension and stress from out of
your feelings.   Then you should dress to be comfortable in clean, loose
fitting clothes or your robes that  you will learn to make later. Let's retire
to your study.
  
When you go to your study it should be at approximately the same time of day
each day.   Do this if at all possible.  Then you should sit down in a very
comfortable chair or couch  and relax as much as possible.  When you have
learned to do relaxing exercises and  "Night Breathing" then you should do
these before you begin to read.  For now just relax  and let all the worry and
tension of the day flow away.  Once you are sufficiently relaxed it  is time
to pick-up the book.

As stated earlier, you are going to read each topic in order.  To begin
reading a topic,  read it through the first time quickly and lightly.  The
first time you are only trying to get  the "spirit" of the topic.  Once you
have done this, you will then want to go back and  reread the topic through
carefully and thoroughly insuring that you understand all that you  read.  You
should go slowly being sure that you understand all that you read.  This is
all  that you will do in the first reading.  If there is anything that you
didn't understand the first  time in sitting, don't worry about it, for it
will come to you later.  You are going to read the  same topic on two separate
days.  This is the minimum that anyone should read a topic  through.

The second time in reading, you will want to go just as slow as you did in the
first reading.   If there is anything you still don't understand then just
lightly think upon it and don't  worry. The answer will eventually come to
you.  After the second reading, if there is  anything to practice or do, this
is the time to do it.  Sounds easy doesn't it?

I have just described the minimum anyone should take per topic. You should not
go on to  the next topic until you are very familiar with the information in
the present topic you are studying.  You should understand the current topic
thoroughly and have practiced what is required of you until you are ready to
go on.  Let your inner guide be your judge about  when you are ready to go on.
You will find that you have to continue to practice many of  the first topics
you study each day in order to eventually master them.  Getting all the way
through the book having only read and practiced everything haphazardly will
only insure  that you are master of none.  To insure your success as a Night
Magician in Night Magick,  you must study as has been outlined here.

You must have a room in which you can be alone and uninterrupted. You must
cleanse yourselves of the outer world.  You must study slowly, carefully,and
thoroughly each topic. You will have to continue to go back and study and
practice daily the knowledge and  exercises until you become master of all.
There is no doubt about it and should he none  in your mind that Night Magick
requires study and work.  The results are more then worth  all the time and
energy that you can give to it.  To become a Master in Night Magick; to
become a Night Magician; to reach and obtain Night Consciousness; this is your
goal.  Let  me show you now the life of a Night Magician and all that it
entails in becoming and  being a Night Magician.

CHAPTER  II


THE NIGHT MAGICIAN

5.  Her/His Life 

The life of a Night Magician is a very special one.  You will find that a
Night Magician's  life is filled with the most powerful magick.  Your world
will not be the same after Night  Magick has filled it.   Your life will have
seemed very ordinary and plain before Night  Magick.  Your life will now be
filled with adventure.

When you have elected to live the life of a Night Magician you have chosen to
accept a  way of life that is different than you have so far experienced.  It
is a life filled with study  and practice of Night Magick and the excitement
and adventure that is a direct result.   Night Magick will fulfill for you
your lifelong aspirations.  It will be my job to present the  life of a Night
Magician to you.  I hope when I'm through that you will find it exciting and
want to begin the adventure of becoming a Night Magician.   Let's enter then
into the life  of a Night Magician. The Night Magician's life is filled with
study and practice of the Night Magick lore.  As you study and practice, the
Oversoul will examine and test your accomplishments.  No matter  who you are,
you came here to gain experience and grow from it.  But upon accepting the
Night Magician's way of life the trials will increase in both number and
intensity.  It is not  that the lore found in this book is difficult, but that
in accepting this life the Night Magician  is tested by life so that s/he may
put into practice Night Magick.  The Night Magician's life  is going to be
filled with many trials.

This is not out of cruelty but out of necessity.   The trials are set upon the
Magician to  build magickal strength and depth in the use of Night Magick.
Every test in the  Magician's life is to build magickal stature and to
increase it once passed.  No matter  whether the test is overcoming a
difficult financial situation, or the working through of a  difficult
marriage, or the death of a loved one, the tests are there to help the Night
Magician grow. If the Night Magician falls then there is nothing else for
her/him to do but  get up, dust off the knees, and keep going knowing that the
next time when faced with a  similar situation success will come. When you
accept the life of a Night Magician there  will be trials and hardships.  But
if you are willing to accept the difficulties and meet the  challenge then you
will not be overcome by them.

You will find solutions to these trials through your knowledge of Night
Magick.  Through  Night Magick, you will raise your magickal vibration and
grow closer to the Oneness of  your Oversoul.  It is through this Oneness, and
the power that flows from it and through  you, that you will be able to handle
these increased tests.  You are learning to become  the Oversoul in all that
you say and do.  No matter what the test, you must meet it in the  Night
Consciousness of your Oversoul.   Through this continual testing, and the
placing of  yourself in the Conscience of your Oversoul, you will become One
with IT.  Thus you will  have passed the final test on Earth and have achieved
the One Goal.  You will have  achieved Night Consciousness.  The Night
Magician's life is thus marked by training and  testing.  But her/his life is
not all training and testing.  For out of this training and testing  will come
adventure.

The Night Magician will travel new avenues of adventure that were never there
before.    The tests the Night Magician receives will take her/him to unusual
places and there will  be experiences that can only be described as exciting
and wonderful.  The Night Magician  will experience new levels of physical
well-being and sexual vitality.  S/he will experience  new job challenges and
opportunities as part of using Night Magick.  There will be  emotional and
mental experiences that break through the limited ways of feelings and
thinking of old.  The Night Magician will experience increases of personal
wealth.   The  Night Magician's life will become aflame with purpose.

That purpose may not always be easy to identify at first, but the Magician
will feel it none  the less, deep within.  Ultimately, through the Night
Magician's way of life, s/he will come  to know that purpose and become it.
The Night Magician is in command of her/his life.   S/he sets the trail where
others will follow.  The Night Magician must grab hold onto life  and in
everything that s/he says and does must express the Night Soul.  The Night
Magician's life is filled with purpose and it is through that purpose that
s/he will unfold  her/his Night Powers.  The Night Magician's purpose is
her/his dream.  It is what s/he  must do while s/he is upon the Earth plane.
But that purpose and dream will set her/him  apart from those adrift on the
sea.

The Night Magician must overcome loneliness as a result of it. S/he must
overcome the misunderstanding of others and press on. There will be many
unbelievers in this world for there are many lost in the Yang matrix, but s/he
must ignore them and all else that  interferes with the dream.  But if the
Night Magician is truly dedicated and willing to  sacrifice for the dream, if
s/he believes in her/himself and the Night Soul within and  expresses only
that Soul, then the Night Magician's dream will manifest itself into the
world.  That dream is the Will of the Oversoul and it will appear into the
world.  The Night  Magician's life is marked by purpose, dedication,
sacrifice, determination, and darkest  love.  The Night Magician's life is
darkest magic of the highest kind.  It is magick that  produces deepest joy
and happiness in the Night Magician's life.  It is the magick of the  Oversoul
on Earth.  The Night Magician's life is aimed at becoming the Oversoul in all
that  is done.  Imagine a life that is filled with nothing but the Nightsoul.

In you, as a Night Magician, the Power and Absolute Love of the Oversoul comes
to its  fullest. When that Power and Absolute Love flows through you and into
the lives of those  around you and on out into the world itself nothing can
remain as it was before.  Everything that the Night Power touches shall be
made anew.  It shall shine with an  Amethyst/Emerald Light Divine. This is the
Night Magick of the Oversoul.  This is Magick  of the Highest Order and it is
in the Night Magician's life.  Here you have some of the  beautiful facets of
the life of a Night Magician.

Her/his life is marked by trials and testing.  This is not meant to discourage
you but to  show the true picture to all would-be Night Magicians.  If you are
to become a Night  Magician then you must truly understand all that is
involved and be willing to give all that  it takes.  It will take
determination, courage, fortitude, and intuition in all the seemingly
hardships.  It will take this to be able to grasp from the lore the knowledge
required and to  put it into practice; to become a Night Magician. The Night
Magician's life is study, training, practice, and being tested.  But the Night
Magician's life is much more.  It is life filled with happiness and joy.  It
is filled with inner peace and absolute love.  It is filled with adventure and
excitement. It is a life filled with success.  The Night Magician is truly in
command of her/his life.    S/he is the Oversoul in action.  This way of life
is all that the Night Magician ever cares to know. Her/his goals for  this
life are all that matters.  These goals are the Night Magician's life and
Night Magick  will ensure the success of achieving these goals.  The life of a
Night Magician is a very  special one.  I would like you to travel with me now
on the roadway the apprentice must  follow to become a Night Magician.

6.  The Apprentice's Unfoldment.   

What I want to do now is draw for you a road map that will take you down the
road of  Night Magick.  The road ahead of you is easy to get lost on just look
at others around you.   If you are going to effectively follow the Night
Magick road you must have signs and  landmarks to guide you and tell you how
far you have come. In the next topic, I will  discuss your final destination,
Night Consciousness.  So let's begin our journey on the  Night Road.

From the beginning of the first descent into material creation, from the first
sojourn on  Earth, it will take many sojourns before one is ready to enter the
Night Road.   There are  many people who are not ready for it.   Their minds
are so preoccupied with doing things  the Yang way, they are so lost in doing
things the hard way, that they have no time for  their own magickal growth.
They are so lost in the illusion of the material world and its  limitations
that they can not see beyond it.  You can see why it will take so many people
hundreds of lives before they can see beyond the illusion of this world and
learn to use  Night Magick in overcoming its so-called limitations.  I should
state from the onset of this  work that there are very few paths or roads
which lead to truly achieving your goals and  overcoming the world of
illusion.  There are many paths dedicated to the Yang Spirit  which is a road
of limitation, hardship, self-denial, and poverty.  It is a path that runs
counter to the Soul and Spirit within you.  I have tried to present here a
road to Night  Consciousness which is simple in nature and language.  It is a
road that requires  persistence, study, courage, boldness, and self-discipline
to travel but the goals you will  achieve on the way and your final attainment
of the ultimate goal makes it all worth while.    There is no way of telling
how long it will take to reach the ultimate goal.

You may be able to reach it in this lifetime or it may take many lifetimes.
Much will  depend upon your aptitude for Night Magick and your dedication and
effort.  It isn't  necessary to reach the ultimate goal in one life.  There
will be many goals and great  changes in your life to make traveling the road
more than worthwhile.  Once you have  entered the Night Road, then life after
life you will return to this world taking up where you  last left off.  This
is because a simple decision to enter the Night Road does not mean that  you
will be accepted and are on your way.

The Night Soul looks for those who are ready to travel the road. You must want
to be on  the road that leads to your Night Soul more than anything else in
your life.  There must be  nothing more important in your life then being on
the road and the desire to achieve your  goals and the ultimate goal.  This
decision must be more then a mental thought.  This  decision must be backed by
action on your part.  Not only do you feel this intense desire  to be on the
Night Road but you are willing to begin the work necessary to achieve it.  In
Night Magick, you will have begun this work by beginning to read and put into
practice the  lore found in this book.  There is no way of determining how
long it will take to be  accepted on the Night Road.  But rest assured, if you
are truly sincere about entering the  road and are willing to do the work then
you will be accepted.   You are the beginner, the  apprentice, on the roadway
to the Night Soul.  Acceptance on the Night Road is no small  thing.
Acceptance on the road is your first landmark and is clearly marked.

In Night Magick, you are an "Earth Apprentice".  You have reached the first
landmark and gained entrance upon the Night Road.  At this point your Oversoul
will begin to take an  active interest in you.  Upon your acceptance, the
Oversoul actively enters into your life.   You will begin to feel the
beginnings of Night Power. You will have the beginning of  increased Oversoul
Power flowing into your life.  But how will you know when you have  been
accepted?

As said before, this acceptance is clearly marked.   You will undergo an
experience that  will definitely let you know you have become an Earth
Apprentice.  For example, you may  in the quiet of your Magician's Study, or
as you are falling asleep some night, suddenly  see the image of the Oversoul
in deep hues of Emerald, Amethyst, Midnight Blue and/or  Silver before you.
As you continue to watch the image of your Oversoul it will start to  come
towards you.  As the Oversoul comes closer, you suddenly know that you are the
Oversoul and Its Face is your face, and the Oversoul enters inside you, and
you feel a  deep, warm glow and power radiating from within.   You know that
the birth of the  Oversoul has taken place within and that you are an Earth
Apprentice.  As an Earth  Apprentice you have become the Night Child.

I refer to the Earth Apprentice as a Night Child for at the time of acceptance
you have  been given birth into the Night World. You are now a Magickal Child
of the Night Spirit.   Your Oversoul will gain new radiance and added power by
actively entering into  cooperation with you.  That new radiance will be seen
by the Watchers and reported to  the Night Guild.  Your acceptance upon the
Night Road heralds your entrance into the  Night Guild.

This Guild is composed of all beings who serve the Dark Light of the Night
Spirit.  The members of the Guild exist both in Higher Dimensions and upon all
material planets.    The highest members of the Guild serve as Teachers and
Directors of the Omniverse  everywhere. One group of members serve as Teachers
and Directors over the Earth.   In  Night Magick, I will refer to them as the
Night Teachers.  I have done this because they  have risen far in magickal
evolution and are One with the Night Soul.  As a new Earth  Apprentice, you
are watched over by a Night Teacher who chooses to do so based on  compatible
nature and vibration.   The assistance of the Night Teacher is one of
watchfulness and occasional guidance as you, the Earth Apprentice, begins to
journey on  the Night Road.  But as you continue to demonstrate your
willingness and dedication to  the road you've chosen, and to the Will of your
Oversoul, the relation between you and the  Night Teacher deepens.   When the
Night Teacher is ready and has determined you are  ready, then you will be
accepted by the Night Teacher as Her/His Chela.

The relationship between the Night Teacher and Her/His chela is a very special
one.  The  Night Teacher gives Her/His continual guidance, support, and power
to the new chela.   The Night Teacher shares Her/His very nature with Her/His
new chela.  The chela may call  upon the assistance of the Night Teacher at
anytime and it will be answered.  Yet the  chela must remember that s/he is
the beginner and that the Will of the Night Teacher  should always be
followed.  The Night Teacher and the Oversoul of the chela work very  closely
together to achieve what must be done by the Oversoul.  The Night Teacher and
chela are as Mother/Father and Daughter/Son.  They share and create in the
Night Power  and Guild.  How will you know though who your Night Teacher is?

There are many ways in which this may come about.  You may meet Her/Him in
your  dreams, or more rarely, S/he may come to you in your waking hours.  For
many of you,  you will just know through your sixth sense.  You will come to
know intuitively who your  Night Teacher is. I will go into greater depth
about the Night Teachers in the later part of  this book.   Do not be worried
or concerned about who the Night Teacher is in your life.   S/he will choose
you and guide you and you should feel secure in this matter.  S/he will
reveal Her/Himself to you in Her/His own time. At this point you are now
progressing upon  the Night Road.

Your first subject area to master in Night Magick will be Earth Magick.   Not
only will you learn a great deal about the Earth and its Magickal Energies and
Power but you will also  be altering physically and magickally.  When you have
achieved sufficient growth and  mastery in this area of Earth Magick you will
be ready for the second landmark.  If you  looked at the last landmark as the
birth of the Oversoul in the your world, as your  becoming the Magickal Child,
then this is "you the Oversoul" as a teenager. Here you  have been transformed
from the Earth Apprentice to the Water Apprentice.

You will begin your study of Water Magick.  This is the area of Night Magick
related to the emotions and astral world. As a Water Apprentice, you will
experience an ever greater increase of the Power of the  Night Soul.  You will
undergo increased emotional development.  You will be given  experiences that
will strengthen that emotional development.  As a Water Apprentice, you  will
gain the ability to know Truth in all Its forms and use that in your everyday
world.  You  will also begin to learn control over your emotions.  The Night
Magician needs emotional  control in order to wield Night Magick effectively.
The power you will be able to wield  without emotional control could do
incredible damage which you may later regret.  The  Night Magician must be
master of her/his emotions not the other way around.  One point I  should
cover is that concerning the aura. Until I go into more detail about it later,
accept for now, that there is an energy that  completely surrounds your body
and extends beyond it about one to three feet.  This  energy field is called
an aura.  The aura reflects emotions and thoughts in people.   The  aura is
made up of swirling energy currents and through magickal sight the aura can be
seen as colors.  All of this you will cover in greater depth in later topics.
In the average  person, the colors that comprise the aura are various and
many.  In the Earth Apprentice,  the color that is predominate in the aura is
green.  In the Water Apprentice, the aura will  be of a light blue.  This is
another indicator of when you have been accepted on the road.   The aura, as
an indicator, will help you further in identification of the next landmark.
You  have seen the things that you must accomplish, or be in the process of
accomplishing, in  order to achieve the next landmark.  You have studied Water
Magick and developed and  strengthened your emotional stature.   When you have
traveled far enough on the Night  Road another landmark appears before you.
You are about to undergo another  transformation and become the Air
Apprentice.

Here you have entered the "Oversoul as a very young adult" stage. The emphasis
as an Air Apprentice is upon mastering Air Magick or Magick of the Mind.   You
will be studying Air Magick and undergo mental training.   You will be
developing  what in Air Magick is known as the Mental Body.  Your studies in
Night Magick will help  develop the Mental Body.  During this phase of life
you may also attend some advance  education or training in the world.   The
mind is a powerful instrument and its training is  critical in Night Magick.
You will be merging your mind with the Higher Mind of the  Oversoul.  This
will lead you to the last part of your journey to becoming a Night Magician.
The last landmark is ahead and you find yourself traveling through Fire.

Here you are the young adult Oversoul.  You are the Fire Apprentice.  Your
studies are of  Fire Magick.  Fire Magick is the Realm of the Oversoul.  It is
the studies of the Higher  Mind and Causal Body.  You now are learning and
using the Night Powers of the  Oversoul.   The power that flows through your
life will be like nothing you have so far  experienced.  This is the time when
you will be reaching adulthood in the Oversoul.  You  will be achieving
oneness with the Oversoul and there will no longer be a you and the  Oversoul.
You are about to become a true channel through which the Night Power will
flow without impediment.  To experience the Night Realm of Fire is to know
life without  time or space.  It is being everywhere and every time.  It is
knowing and seeing all that  has ever been, is, and will be: and as the Silent
Watcher and Observer seeing it all  unfold.  It is like standing amongst the
sea of stars and knowing that this is all that you  are.  It is feeling and
being a part of unlimited darkness and absolute love. This is  perhaps the
longest part of the journey.  There is much to study, experience, and develop
into.   But finally like all journeys, this one comes to an end. And at the
end of the Night  Road, you are no longer an Apprentice but a Night Magician.

You and the Oversoul are One.  You are the mature, adult Oversoul on Earth.
Words only  tend to limit the experience of this achievement.  The Night Power
that you now feel is so  great that you have trouble controlling it as it
surges through your material being.  This  experience can never be adequately
described by words but must be lived to be known.   This is the point which
hails the complete union of the Higher and lower selves.  The  Oversoul and
you are now One to the greatest possible extent.  The Causal body is now
shared as One by the Oversoul and you.   A person with magickal sight of
sufficient  advancement will see a fully developed Causal Body with the full
and active Presence of  the Oversoul within it.  The aura will glow with an
intense deep amethyst/silver glow.  You  and the Oversoul share Its Powers and
capabilities jointly. You are One and Inseparable  in Consciousness and Action
with the Oversoul.   You have experienced everything that  you must in life.
You are now free of Karma.  This is the last material vehicle you will  have
to express through on Earth.  You are the master of the lower worlds.  You
know the  cycles of birth and rebirth and know the happiness at having
completed the need to ever  undergo the cycle again.   You are free from life
that ends in death.  You have become all  knowledge, power, wisdom, and
control of the Oversoul.  Is your journey really over?

No, not really.  There will always be a perfecting process going on.  There
will always be  new heights to climb and greater understanding to be achieved.
What is included in this  book as Night Magick is really only the "tip of the
iceberg".  But you will always enjoy  your continued travels and adventures on
the Night Road.  There will always be new  things to discover.  There will
always be new adventures and excitement on the Night  Road. I have done my
best to guide you this far on the Night Road.

I want you to understand that this map is not set in concrete. The general
course has been  laid out for you but the time you take to travel on the road
and the tests and experiences  you will undergo are known only to the
Oversoul.  Sometimes you may detour slightly into  another area of magick and
that's ok as long as it is the Will of the Oversoul.  I would like  now to
help you understand the Consciousness of the Oversoul.  I call it Night
Consciousness and it is what you will ultimately achieve.


7.  Night Consciousness 

There are countless numbers of Souls in creation.   The Soul, that is your
Oversoul, is  unique throughout the Omniverse.  The consciousness of the
Oversoul is separated from  the consciousness of the human being.  It is
possible for the two consciousness to join.   This union of consciousness I
refer to as Night Consciousness.  I am going to explore with  you the inner
depths of Night Consciousness.  You will discover things that you will have
to do in order to attain it.  You will learn to live and practice it and the
changes that will  take place within you as you start to acquire it.  First
though, we are going to examine, in  greater detail, exactly what Night
Consciousness is.

Night Consciousness, in humankind, is a state of causal, mental, emotional,
and physical being.  It is becoming the Oversoul in each of these states of
being.  It is reaching the  greatest possible state of perfection while here
on Earth.  The Causal body is to the  Overself what the physical/etheric body
is to humankind.  Its lowest vibrational body.

The Causal Body is the storehouse for the experiences of countless lifetimes
in  incarnation. The Overself experiences life from its dimension through the
Causal Body  just as we experience physical life through the physical body.
When you have achieved  Night Consciousness you will be able to consciously
use the Causal Body.  You will be  able to directly tap into awareness of the
Oversoul.  This will directly effect your mental  being.

Mentally, you must achieve all that the Oversoul is.  It is your mental
development and attitude which will carry you into this Magickal
Consciousness.  When you have mentally  set your sights upon your goal and
give it all that you possible have, then you will bring it  into manifestation
within you.  Night Consciousness is mentally being aware of all  knowledge and
wisdom of the Oversoul.  You will know, whatever it is that you must know  by
simply tapping into it.  You will have supreme wisdom for all situations
knowing just  what and how to do it. You may have never studied the subject
before but the knowledge  will be there when you need it. You will have
tremendous willpower and concentration.   This is Night Consciousness in
humankind.  Night Consciousness is more then just a  mental state.  It is also
your emotional state of being.

It fills your world of feeling and changes it to perfection.  It is having
perfect  understanding of all situations.  It is the giving of perfect,
absolute love.  This is love  beyond the human state that enters you into the
absolute state of being.  More on this in a  later topic.  The emotional state
in Night Consciousness is one of silence and profound  solitude.  It is a high
state of reflection and receptivity.   It is also a state of aggression,
boldness, and daring.  Night Consciousness is an emotional state of passion,
courage  and love of pleasure and ease.

This Consciousness even descends into the physical state of being.  Your
bodies become  pure, Night Energy through Night Consciousness.  The body
becomes the perfect channel  through which the Oversoul may flow out into the
world.  Night Consciousness is perfect  control and mastery of the physical
being.  This is Night Consciousness in the four  aspects of humankind. Night
Consciousness is many things to humankind.

It is a state of bliss and peace that humankind has yet to know. It is a state
of perfect knowledge, wisdom, absolute love, understanding, innocence,
happiness, joy, and  freedom.  It is a state of awareness that words can not
do justice to.  Words only tend to  diminish the real understanding of the
nature of Night Consciousness.   Yet I have made  the attempt to do so in
hopes that you would have a better understanding of what it is.   Night
Consciousness is the goal of life on Earth.  It is a goal worth giving your
all in  dedication, devotion, and determination to in reaching it.  Therefore,
let's see exactly  what you will have to do in reaching the Bliss of Night
Consciousness.

The things necessary to do, to reach Night Consciousness, may at first seem to
overwhelm you. There is a great deal to accomplish if you want to reach it.
But you  should not be scared by the number of things you must accomplish, nor
by the feeling that  some of them seem impossible for you to do.   Nothing
that is described here will be  impossible for you to do if you will be
determined and persistent in your efforts.  To begin  you must master the
physical body.

Its alright to indulge the physical body with food, pampering and passion.  At
the same  time, you must also balance this with physical training to maintain
physical well-being.   The body is essential to every Night Magician for it is
the channel through which Night  Magick flows and alters the world.  Take care
of it. Much of the knowledge you will gain  will slowly alter the human body
changing its frequency into harmony with the Night  Force. As the body changes
you will be able to increase the flow of the Night Force  through you.  Do
everything in balance. You must become masters of your emotional life.

From the onset of studying Night Magick you will experience emotions.  It is
alright to experience and even use the emotions in Night Magick.  But at all
times, you must be in  control them. You must not be ruled by jealousy, lust,
pride, or selfishness. You must  control anger and hatred.  These things will
still try to enter into your feelings but you will  gain instant control over
them.   You must remain in control under all conditions.  No  matter how
disturbing the current challenges in your life you must remain centered.   You
must also maintain a balanced mind.

Your mind must always be centered in the silence of the Night. There is great
power in  the silence of the Mind.  Your mind should be fixed in
self-discipline and strong-willed.   Your mind must be fixed in intellectual
pursuit and critical thinking.  You must maintain  original and independent
thinking at all times. You will be inventive and versatile in your  thinking.
Your mind set must be one of persistence, patience and persevering.  Your
mind will at times be required to act in a reserved and cautious manner and at
other times  courageous, bold, and gallant. Flexibility to meet the ever
changing challenges is the key  of Night Consciousness. You must be temperate,
wise, and poised in all things.  These  are just a few of the things necessary
for you to reach Night Consciousness.

They are not easy to master.   Yet they must be mastered and put actively into
your life.   You must live and practice Night Consciousness from the very
beginning.  This topic is  placed early in the book because it is the first
thing which you will have to learn and begin  practicing in Night Magick.  If
you are to have any success at all in Night Magick, you will  have to practice
and master this topic.  In all other subjects you will study and master in
this book, Night Consciousness is of the most importance.   It will bring you
success in all  other things you attempt in Night Magick.  How then do you
practice and live Night  Consciousness?

To begin, you must live the life of the Oversoul.  You must be consciously
aware of the  Night Power that flows through you from your Oversoul.
Everywhere you go, you must  constantly remain in the Consciousness of the
Oversoul.  You must know that you are the  Oversoul and radiate Night Power.
You must speak and act as the Oversoul.  You must  gain a very special
attitude towards life.   You must learn to be in the world but not of it.
You must not become lost in the illusions of limitations.  With the aid of
Night Magick you  will want for nothing but at the same time you must never
allow material possessions to  possess you.  Your magickal life must be
balanced by your practical life.  You must give  each part of your life equal
time.  Your practical life should be filled with your magickal  nature.  You
must learn to take each day, one at a time.  It is wrong to worry about
tomorrow for in Night Consciousness your destiny of success is assured.  You
must learn  to obey your Oversoul as you would yourself for in reality you and
the Oversoul are One.   All of your needs will be taken care of through Night
Consciousness. That doesn't mean  you can just sit back and do nothing.  You
must give your full effort to life but without  worry or concern about your
future.  If you are following the Night Road to Night  Consciousness, then the
outcome is clear.  There is also one other thing that you can do  to enhance
your attaining Night Consciousness until you become more adept in Night
Magick.

In your pursuit of Night Consciousness you will be greatly benefitted if you
will get out into  the outdoors as much as possible.  The beauty, peace, and
power of nature will do much  in restoring and helping to maintain your
Oversoul Nature.  The Earth is a storehouse of  Night Energy and by your
visits to those places where the Earth has been relatively  untouched you will
be able to absorb the Night Energy.  If you begin to practice what I just
covered and continue to study and practice Night Magick then you will
eventually reach  Night Consciousness.  But only your Oversoul knows all the
things necessary for you to do  to reach Night Consciousness and the time
required to do so.  So you must be untiring in  your efforts to reach it and
know that it will come.  You must come to know that there is no  separation in
Consciousness between you and your Oversoul.  There are signs which will
indicate to you that you are starting to approach Night Consciousness.

There are changes that will take place within you all along the road to your
final  destination. These changes will help reassure you that you are making
progress.  One of  the first significant changes in your life will be a new
powerful inner vibration.

You will become charged with a new zest for life.  The Oversoul Power will
flow through  you and raise every cell in your body in a glorious fire.  You
will find you will need less  sleep and yet your energy will remain very high.
You will find that your health will be  greatly improved and that your
breathing will come much easier.  Your body will become  the Body of your
Oversoul.  You will find yourselves growing more in the ways of the  Silver
Rule.  You may do anything that you want if you always maintain the Eternal
Night  Balance.  You will begin to hear an Inner Voice who will be your
instructor and guardian.   This Inner Voice will be that of your Oversoul
and/or Night Teacher who will guide you and  care for you.  This will cause
you to develop flashes of intuition.  These brief moments of  insight should
be carefully listened to and followed.  If you do, then the help will continue
to come to you.  You will find that your knowledge seems to increase within
you.  You will  gain an understanding of things that you never seemed to
understand before.  You will  instinctively seem to know what to do about a
particular problem. For example, if your car  breaks down you will know almost
immediately what is wrong with it and if possible, how  to repair it.  You
will also come to know Truth from untruth.  It doesn't matter whether that
source originates from a person, reading material, or whatever, you will know
whether  what is said is True or not.  Nothing will be able to hide from your
inner knowing and  vision.  This is also about the time when your lower
psychic abilities and faculties start to  open up.  You will learn a great
deal about them later in the book.  They will give you  abilities and powers
beyond that of other people.  Therefore you must be careful in using  them
such that the Eternal Night Balance is always maintained.  Do not worry about
these  centers for now in a later topic you will be given what you need to
maintain control. You will feel a greater need for solitude and a time away
from people.  There are more  indications of approaching Night Consciousness
and you will learn more about them as  you continue your studies of Night
Magick.  Remember, Night Consciousness is a  physical, emotional, mental, and
causal development. You know some of the things to concentrate on to help
develop this consciousness.  As I  just said you will learn more of the
essentials to help develop this consciousness as you  learn Night Magick.
You have also learned some of the indicators of your developing  Night
Consciousness and when you finally reach it you will know it.  What is
required is  effort, dedication, persistence, self-discipline and study.  With
all this, you will achieve  Night Consciousness. Combined with Night Magick
there won't be a thing you can't  achieve.  Your imagination and dreams are
the only limits in Night Magick.  From this  point in your study of Night
Magick, I would like to go over the principles upon which a  Night Magician's
life is based.

CHAPTER III


BEGINNING NIGHT MAGICK

8.  Standards and Principles of Practicing Night Magick 

You are about to embark on the Night Road of learning Night Magick and
achieving Night Consciousness.  There are certain standards and practices
which you must include in  your life while on the Road.  I have covered a few
of them already but I will go into greater  depth over some of them and cover
some additional standards and principles to insure  your success.

The Silver Rule (silver being a precious metal to the Night Force) is "you may
do anything  that you want if you always maintain the Eternal Night Balance".
The Eternal Night  Balance is a fundamental law of the Night Force.  Balance
in the Omniverse is a vital  factor to order within the Eternal Night. For
everything you take from the Eternal Night you  must give back to the Eternal
Night in equal measure.  This does not mean of course that  if through Night
Magick, using the energy of the Night Force, you acquire wealth that you  must
give money back to the Night Force.  It means that the amount of energy used
to  accomplish something must be returned in full.  This keeping of the
Eternal Night Balance  is an intuitive matter that is easy to maintain when
working within Night Consciousness.    Therefore, before using Night Magick to
accomplish any event, always work within the  consciousness of the Oversoul to
be able to maintain the Balance.  There also follows  another major principle
within which you must practice Night Magick.  This is the "Law of  Night
Magick".
  
The Law of Night Magick is "there is nothing impossible when you are One with
the Night Force".  I mean absolutely nothing. Always remember this fundamental
law and believe it  with all your might.  Remember that everything you do in
life is Night Magick. It should be  done in Night Consciousness.  Your whole
life is now an expression of Night Magick and Consciousness.  There is nothing
you cannot do.   I'd like to turn for the moment to the principles governing
the Night Magician and the world as a whole.

You will find the world to be rather hostile to you concerning Night Magick.
The religions  of the world are predominantly Yang. The majority of people
have been conditioned to  respond in a Yang manner.  Yang and Yin are opposite
forces which do not mix well.  From Night Consciousness's view, each soul is
responsible for its own world.  Each soul  determines much of its life and the
quality of that life before coming here.  There is some  predestination in all
lives yet there is much which is not.  If individuals are poor and/or
homeless then this gives the Oversoul that experience.  If souls are wealthy
then that is  another experience.  This world offers a myriad of different
experiences for the Oversoul  to live and experience.   The Oversoul lives
many lives on Earth in order to get a well-rounded education.  The Earth can
be a very rough school and souls here are  experiencing in essence the first
grade of life.  When the Oversoul has experienced all  the lessons it deems
necessary then It moves on to a new world with more advanced  lessons to be
learned.   This system is called reincarnation and is very difficult for much
of the world to except.

They would rather explain much of the world's problems and their own as the
fault of  someone else.  The Christians blame Satan for the ills of the world.
There are many  people who blame their government.   Others blame other people
and their not caring  about their fellow human. The Night Magician blames no
one.

The Night Magician knows that her/his beginnings on this planet are chosen
from the  other side of life.  S/he chooses her/his parents, race, sex,
country, and many of the future  events before arriving to insure that the
necessary lessons for this life are achieved.  It  may sound terrible but a
woman may actually chose to be raped in order to gain that  experience and
learn from it.  There are children born bad.  They are souls who  previously
raped, murdered, robbed, etc. and are returning little changed from their
previous lives.  Human souls are not born innocent regardless of how innocent
that baby  looks in her/his cradle. They have lived before on Earth and are
returning little changed  from when they last lived on Earth.  They are a
bundle of possibilities and potentials and  already have the beginnings of
personality for this life.  You arrive the same way but as a  Night Magician
you must take charge of your life. If you don't like it then change it.  Use
Night Magick to alter your world.  Some parts of life  are predestined but
many are not. The free times feel like your adrift on a sea without  much
direction.  This is the time to chose a new direction.  You shouldn't get
involved in  changing all the world's ills.

I believe someone said before that there will always be the poor and hungry.
This is true because this world requires those experiences for a certain group
of souls.  There will  always be crime because there will always be others who
want what someone else has.   There are experiences of hardship, suffering,
crime, poverty, hunger, divorce, physical  and sexual abuse, and a thousand
more like it.  There are experiences of wealth, fame,  comfort, peace, happy
marriage, beautiful children, successful career, and a thousand  more like it,
too.  The Oversoul needs all these experience possibilities.  The Night
Magician chooses her/his experiences and controls them through Night Magick.
The  Night Magician knows that the rest of the world chooses their experiences
too and lives  them the best they can so that the Oversoul may gain
experience.  Help the other soul  when led by your Oversoul to do so.  But
have no guilt, nor interfere in another soul's  existence, when in Night
Consciousness you know that what they are experiencing is  necessary.  The
practice of Night Magick requires that the affairs of your world move with  a
steady, even pace.

There is no set limit as to how fast this pace may be.  Setting limits upon
pace is a  relative matter.  But the pace must be even and steady.  Do not
become so embroiled in  the everyday routines of the hustling, bustling world
that your world is conducted without  Night Magick. You must have a magickal
attitude while in the world.  You must keep your  consciousness raised above
the mire and limitations of the world.  You must approach life  with passion
and zest.

In Night Consciousness, life is an adventure. Life is usually made up of one
adventure  after another.  Everything that has happened to you is a type of
adventure that requires  your use of Night Magick to see it through.   There
are adventures which you may feel  have had an unhappy ending.  Perhaps that
ending did not have to occur with the use of  Night Magick.  If you are in the
Night Flow and something bad seems to have happened  perhaps there was a
reason.  Use Night Magick to find out.   Use Night Magick to correct  the
situation.  Do all this in Night Consciousness. There will be times when you
must  approach life with courage, boldness, and energy.    There will be other
times when you  must use caution, prudence, and reflection. Approach life from
Night Consciousness and  you will always know what to do.  In Night
Consciousness, life is art.

You are the Night Magician.  You are the artist.  Create!  Create any kind of
life you want.   Your imagination is the limit.  Fill your life with passion
and love.  Fill your life with honor, dignity, and pride in the works you
create.  As the artist be inventive and imaginative in  what you create as
your life.  If you want wealth that is fine.  If you want pleasure and  ease
that is fine.  Remember, Night Balance in what you create.  The Night Magician
operates from a point of solitude.

The Night Magician is a solitary worker.  This doesn't mean you won't have
friends.  You  may be a very active person socially with many friends.  You
can even practice Night  Magick collectively in groups.  But ultimately, the
Night Magician is a solitary worker.  The  Night Magician must achieve mastery
in Night Magick and Night Consciousness on  her/his own.  No one else can do
this for you.  I can show you how to practice Night  Magick and give you the
keys to obtaining Night Consciousness but I can't bestow upon  you, mastery in
Night Magick or Night Consciousness.  This you must do on your own with
study, self- discipline, effort and energy.

Night Magick is for those willing to pursue knowledge.  It takes knowledge not
faith to  become a Night Magician.  It takes a lover of independent thinking.
One who is free of  convention and is not a sheep in the world.  It takes
mental precision and intelligence to  master Night Magick. It will require
will power and perseverance to overcome obstacles  when they show up.  You
must learn control of thoughts.  You will hear this over and over,  "thoughts
are things".  I don't know who first said this but remember it.  If you think
thoughts of poverty then guess what, you are poor.  If you wish some one dead,
even idly,  then they may die.   Through Night Magick, thoughts become things
with purpose.  Learn  control of your thoughts from the onset. Emotions are
also part of this.

Emotions add energy to thoughts.  So you must also learn to control emotions.
Emotions,  like thoughts, are energy and energy changes the world around you.
I am not limiting any  thoughts or emotions from your world.  You are free to
think and feel anything you want.   But remember, thoughts and emotions will
change the world around you and you are  responsible for those changes.  Keep
the Eternal Night Balance.  Remember the Silver  Rule and you will have no
problems.   You need to take care of your physical body.

Night Magicians come in all shapes and sizes.  There are no requirements in
this area.   What is important is the physical body is the ultimate channel
through which the Night  Force flows out into the world.  You need to keep
that channel as in tuned with the Night  Force as possible. You will learn
techniques to do this shortly.  Try to maintain oneness  with your Oversoul
and the Night Force by keeping them in your thoughts and emotions at  all
time.  This will help maintain the balance.   It is alright to smoke, eat, and
provide the  body with physical pleasure. But balance is again important to
your practicing Night  Magick.  You can't practice Night Magick if you die of
overeating, heart attack, or cancer.   You will learn to control your thoughts
and emotions to help prevent these things.  But if  you go too far one way
then all your knowledge won't help if the body can't act as a  channel for the
Night Force.  Balance pleasure with physical exercise, breathing  exercises
with smoking, and right thoughts and emotions that will control the stress and
pressures in your life.  I want to talk to you about drugs.

Their use is a very popular thing.  In the right hands drugs can be very
beneficial to  human health.  Magickally, drugs have been used to induce
certain mental and emotional  states.  In the case of Night Magick, DON'T USE
THEM!  Drugs have more then a physical  effect.  They alter the etheric,
astral, and mental bodies. Drugs can do severe damage to  these bodies that
may take many "lifetimes" to repair.  I assure you that there is nothing
drugs can do for you that Night Magick can't do for you.  There is no high or
altered state  that Night Magick can't achieve for you. Drugs can so alter
your many bodies that by using Night Magick you will place yourself in danger
of losing your physical life. Moreover, you may lose your emotional and mental
stability that will require hospitalization.   So far, I have not limited you
in thought or  action in this book.  But in this case, be warned.  Do not use
drugs.  If you are using  prescription drugs under a physician's care and they
severely alter your state of being  then for that time don't practice Night
Magick.  Wait till you no longer need the drugs.   Under drugs I am also
including alcohol. On occasion you may feel like getting drunk.  As  you
progress in Night Consciousness you will eventually be able to drink and not
get  drunk.  For most, that is a long time from now. Drinking, to a lesser
degree, alters the  physical, etheric, astral, and mental bodies.   The
effects are usually not as damaging  unless you overdose on alcohol.  Drinking
in moderation is fine. There is nothing wrong  with an occasional drink.  For
some though, an occasional drink becomes overuse of  alcohol which ultimately
will have the same effect as non-alcohol drugs. Again, do not  practice Night
Magick while under the influence of alcohol regardless of the amount of
alcohol.  It has the same possible effect as non-alcohol drugs.   Let's go on
to sex.

In today's world one usually talks about sex after talking about drugs.  Sex
is great.  With  Night Magick, sex is going to become fantastic.  The energy
that is going to flow through  you during orgasm will give you the ultimate
orgasms of your life.   There are though  some rules that apply to this area.

It should be obvious that you must practice "safe sex".  The male should use a
condom  and the woman should be sure he uses it.  No matter how close you are
to your spouse or  circle of friends unless you're sure of their monogamy, men
use condoms.   Women  should also use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy. Men
should learn how to put on  condoms to insure they don't break and never use
petroleum products that will cause the  latex to break.  Women should also
know how to put a condom on a man to insure the  man does it right.  You may
find that as you increase in Night Consciousness and the flow  of the Night
Force increases that the only time you will achieve those ultimate orgasms is
when the partner is also practicing Night Magick.

In Night Magick, concerning sex, it doesn't matter whether the couple is
heterosexual,  male- male, female-female.  It doesn't matter if the couple act
alone.  It doesn't matter if  there is a man and more then one woman or a
woman and more then one man to the  couple.  It doesn't matter if there is a
group of couples of all polarities.  It doesn't matter if  the group is
exclusively men or women.  What really makes the difference is if everyone  is
practicing Night Magick.

When all are practicing Night Magick then all are in the Night Flow.  Everyone
present will have some increase of energy flowing through them.  All will feel
the bond of Night Consciousness.  In Night Magick there is no jealousy or
possessiveness.  In Night Magick  there is no Judeo-Christian, or Moslem, or
Mormon, or any oppressive religious hang-ups  about sex. Each Night Magician
is independent and free.  Marriage under Night Magick  is not one of
possession but of mutual cooperation and love.

Group marriage is a very real possibility under Night Magick because a Night
Magician  honors independence, freedom, and equality in action among Night
Magicians.  There is  no jealousy or possessiveness among Night Magicians.
Women and Men have equal  rights in Night Magick and Consciousness and in the
world itself.  But marriage between a  Night Magician and non- practicing
human being rarely works out. Ultimately, the Night Magician changes so much
that the spouse no longer understands  the Night Magician.  It is very rare to
find a spouse who will understand the Night  Magician and their way of life.
The marriage often ends in divorce.  But it is better to  divorce and remain
friends then to stay in a marriage which creates hostility and  resentment.
There is no balance in such a marriage.  Many are made to feel guilty if there
are children involved and stay married although there is hostility and
resentment  between them.   I believe it is better for everyone involved if
the couple divorce, and even  if they can't remain friends, to at least remain
cooperative and fair with each other  concerning settlement and visitation.
Balance and harmony are important in a Night  Magician's life.  It is
important to her/his success on the Night Road.  Also important to  this
success and of a more concrete nature are Magickal Tools.

Down through the ages the Ancient Night Magicians have used many different
types of  tools and implements in the practice of the Ancient Art.  You too
are going to need  Magickal Tools and in the next topic I will help you attain
these tools.

9.  A Night Magician's Tools and Weapons 

These are the Night Tools a Night Magician will need to set the proper
atmosphere and  conduct the basic rites.  You will conduct these rites in the
room you have designated as  your Magician's Study within the Magick Circle
which you will define its area with the  Night Cord.

This cord should be made of silk, cotton, or wool.  The cord needs to be long
enough so  that when it is laid down on the floor it will form a circle that
contains the altar and  yourself.  If there are more people then yourself
conducting Night Magick or even possibly  just observing then you will need a
long enough length to make a large enough circle to  contain them.  Within the
Night Circle you will build the Night Altar.

The Night Altar is symbolic for your physical being in which is focused the
Night Spirit.   You will build an altar upon which you will focus your Powers
of Eternal Darkness here on  the Earth plane.  It is best to keep it simple.
The basic structure can be a small table,  box, or anything which is sturdy.
The altar should be about three feet wide by six feet  long.  The height of
the Night Altar is your decision.  You can have one which is at waist  height
when you are standing and one for when you are sitting.  It is best to have
both in  your magickal inventory. Place the Night Altar so that when you are
standing or sitting  behind it you are facing North. Use a compass if
necessary so that you can place it  facing North.  Then cover the Night Altar
with a cloth of your choice.  If at all possible  choose a black, red, or
silver colored cloth.  It is best if the cloth has no distinctive pattern  on
the surface portion of the altar.  This is your Night Altar.  You then must
place upon it  some very special articles.

Upon the altar and towards the back left side place a red candle and on the
right side  place a black candle.  On the left side and in front of the red
candle place an incense  holder and on the right place your copy of Night
Magick.  You may also place any other  small trinkets that help build your
feeling of Night Magick.  Dragons, wizards, owls, and  so on are fine.  The
Night Altar is a sacred symbol before which you come to release  Night Power.
It is the physical symbol of your body and heart and serves the same  purpose:
an anchor of the Night Force.  You will need a good supply of incense to fill
the  incense holder on your Night Altar.  Through trial and error you will
find the right incense  that fits your personal vibration.  Each incense
creates a vibration in the air and as you  grow more magickal, you will be
ever more sensitive to its vibration.  Incense, which is of  the stick variety
and is thick in nature is good or you may have a small charcoal brazier  and
powdered incense.  On the Night Altar you will also need the following things:
a  silver or crystal dish of sea salt; a vial of patchouli oil;  a crystal
bowl of water; a silver or  crystal chalice; and a silver or crystal bell. Now
all these articles sit on a Pentacle which  is in the center of the Night
Altar.

The Pentacle is a symbol of the Earth.  It is a round plate made of wood and
inscribed  with sacred symbols of Night Magick.  The plate is thirteen inches
in diameter.  For an  example of such a plate and the layout of the articles
see Figure 1.  Then you will need a  loose leaf notebook which will become
your Night Magician's Grimoire.

From the very beginning of Night Magick you will have practices, exercises,
and rites to perform and grow from.   After each practice, exercise, or rite
you should develop a  grimoire which records the date, time, and experiences
felt in that session. Record in as  much detail as possible the successes and
difficulties experienced.  Keep a separate  section for each type of practice,
exercise, and rite.  This will allow you to see your  progress in each and to
help you see where your difficulties are and how to possibly solve  them.  Be
faithful and accurate in all entries made and this record will help speed your
progress. These are your Night Tools.  Next you will need your Night Weapons
the first of  which is a Night Amulet.

You need to make for yourself an amulet of black quartz crystal. This is a
grounding and  power stone of Night Force.  If you want, the necklace the
stone hangs from can also be  made from quartz. I recommend though that the
necklace be made of silver or amethyst.   This will help balance the power of
the black quartz stone.  The Night Amulet will help  keep your physical body
in tune with the Night Force.  You can tune into the Night Amulet  and by
holding it increase your vibration in the Night Force. You will also need to
make a  Night Ring.

This should be a ring made of silver.  You can set the Night Ring with any
combination of amethyst, black quartz, emerald, ruby, or diamond.   A plain
band of silver is fine.  You  may later want to add Night Runes and Night
Magick Symbols to the Night Ring as you  learn them. The Night Ring is a
symbol of union with the Night Force.   Next you need to  make your Night
Wand.

The wand should be about thirteen inches long.  It should be made of wood or
silver. You  may encrust the wand with a combination of semi-precious and
precious jewels.  You may  inscribe the Night Wand with Night Runes and
Symbols.  You will find these in Appendix  C.  You may place a crystal at
either or both ends of the wand.  The Night Wand is a focus  of the Night
Energy that leaves your body to be transmitted to an object or place.  You now
need to make a Night Staff.

The Night Staff is a symbol of Night Guidance, Power, and Authority.  The
Night Staff is to  be made of wood.  The kind of wood is left up to you but it
should be one which you are in  harmony with.  The Night Staff should be
approximately six feet high.  You should leave  the staff in its natural state
or paint it black, red or silver if you feel its necessary.   As said earlier,
the Night Staff is a symbol of true Night Power and the Night Spirit's support
to  you.  You will need a Night Athame.

This is a small dagger whose blade and handle is about twelve inches in
length.  This is  used for ceremonial purposes only.  Do not use this knife
for cutting.  You may want to  place special symbols on the handle and/or
blade to add magickal importance to your  athame.  Make for your Night Athame
a scabbard  which you can place on a belt on your  person.  You will also need
a Night Sword.

You can use any style of sword.  Japanese samurai, scimitar, cavalry sword, or
excalibur  style sword.  You should also have a scabbard which you keep the
sword in and attach it  to your side under your Night Cape.   Of course, the
next item you need is a Night Cape.

There is an easy way to make the Night Cape.  Take enough cloth so that you
have a  square which is twice your height long on each side.  Now go to the
center of the cloth,  and using a string that is half the length of one side
of the cloth and on one end has a  chalk stick attached, draw a circle on the
cloth that has the radius of half the length of one  side of the cloth.  Also
draw from the center a circle that has a radius of three inches.    Now cut
out the small circle and the large circle.  Then place a slit from one edge of
the  small circle you just cut down the center of the cloth and through the
edge.  Sew ties into  the material on the edge you just cut and near the top
of the cape. You will also need to  make a hood that will cover your entire
head and will go over the head far enough to cover  the face.  You may attach
the hood to the cape.  See figure ___.  The Night Cape serves a  valuable
purpose.

The Night Cape acts as an insulator to the outside forces that surround you.
It will help  block them out of your inner world and keep them from
interfering in your magickal  operations. Keep the cape secured in a cloth bag
and put it where no one else may touch  or bother it.  Use it only in the
practice of Night Magick. Next you will need to make the  Night Plate.

Actually this is a breast plate.  The basic shape and size of this plate is
given in Figure __.   You may change the size and shape as fits you best.  You
may place upon the plate Night  Symbols and Runes.  You may also want to place
stones of black quartz, amethyst,  emerald, ruby, or diamond on it.  The color
of the plate should be black with runes and  symbols in red and silver.
Finally  you will need to make a Night Shield.

The Night Shield is patterned after the shields used by knights of chivalry.
Some basic  shapes and sizes are given in Figure ___.  Again the background
should be black and  symbols and runes should be in red and silver.  The runes
and symbols you place on the  shield as with the Night Plate should help you
increase your feeling of strength and  courage in Night Magick. These runes
and symbols should help place you in Night  Consciousness.  The Night
Magician's Tools and Weapons are very valuable to you. They provide for you a
means to advance in Night Magick.   They provide the proper atmosphere in
which to practice the lore of Night Magick.  There are other devices that will
be needed as you progress in your studies.  As a rule, each will be relatively
simple to  acquire. They will be brought to your attention as you proceed.
The Night Magician's  Tools and Weapons given here are those which you will
need before you proceed further  in Night Magick. Once you have your tools and
weapons made it is time to select your  Night Name.

10.  Your Magickal Night Name 

The true name given to anything is very important.  A true name contains the
essence of  that entity.  It describes the differences and qualities of that
entity.  To know the true name  of a thing is to imply acquisition and
knowledge of that essence. To know the true name  gives you dominion over it.
The name that you as a Night Magician will choose is of great  importance.

You will select a Night Name which to you contains the very essence of your
Inner Nature.   This name may be the same as a famous personage you wish to
emulate or a famous  saying or motto. For example, you may choose a name such
as Merlin, Saint Germain,  Abra-Melin, Mithratar, or any other name that
strikes your imagination and heart.  You  may choose a name from a saying or
motto.  A Night Name will help to build-up your  Night Essence, your feeling
of Night Consciousness and will quicken your magickal  vibration.  This name
should be given to no one else to know.  It is your own Magickal  Name that
when used will bring you to Night Consciousness.  Now, you must choose a
second name.

This is the name that you will be known outwardly by to fellow Night
Magicians.  You  should pattern this name after something unlike your Night
Name.  This name will be  used on all correspondence with other Night
Magicians and any published writings.  The  second name is your public name
and is used in such rites and exercises.  Remember, to  know the name of a
thing is to know its Eternal Essence and to have dominion over it.

In selecting a magickal name you are defining that Inner Essence. To tell
another is to  give him access to your Inner Nature.   He may reach you and
make demands of you  whenever he chooses by knowing your inner name.  Do not
reveal it for any reason.  You  should always use your second or outer name as
Night Magicians. To do so will insure  that you will never be bothered here or
hereafter.  Both names are important and should  be selected to help bring you
into your Night Consciousness.  Your Night Name will bring  you closer into
the aura of Night Magick.  Having selected your Night Name you now must  learn
Magickal Protection in order to conduct Night Magick safe from outside
influences.

11.  Night Pillar 

What you are about to learn is perhaps the most valuable Night Tool you will
ever  acquire. There are many forces in the world which will attempt to do you
harm if you  practice Night Magick. By harm, I don't necessarily mean physical
violence although that  is possible.  I am talking about the threat of harm to
your subtle bodies: Astral, Mental,  and Causal bodies. Harm to these bodies
could cause serious emotional and mental  sickness.  There is also the threat
of attack to your Etheric which usually translates to  physical harm.   For
Night Magicians there is a serious threat of attack from Yang  followers. This
could be from so- called White Magicians and their use of magick against you.
It could come from Christians, Jews, Muslims and so on. Attacks can come from
collective emotional or mental energy meant to harm a Night Magician.  A group
of Yang  worshipers gathered together in prayer praying for the demise of all
Night Magicians  everywhere could build up enough energy to harm the
unprotected Night Magician.  As  you grow more magickal you will become very
sensitive to subtle energies around you.   Attacks could come from anyone who
wishes you harm.  You will need protection.  You  will need to build the Night
Pillar.  The Night Pillar is not just for protection.

The Night Pillar also acts as an invisible wall which will contain the energy
you will be creating through Night Magick. This will allow you to build-up the
energy to a great  intensity before you release it to accomplish your will.
This will increase the effectiveness  of the magickal rites you create.  So
how do you build the Night Pillar.

You begin by calming and clearing your mind of extraneous thoughts.  Close
your eyes  and visualize the Night Energy collecting around your form.  See
the Night Energy forming  a pillar of protective force that extends around you
about six feet.  See that energy flowing  below your feet and above your head.
See yourself in a pillar of deep violet and emerald  energies.  See yourself
in a pillar of darkest night.  Know that you cannot be harmed while  contained
in the Night Pillar.  Now say the following invocation:

"I am a Night Magician surrounded in a Pillar of Night Energy that cannot be
penetrated.   It repels all energy that would harm me.  It repels all thoughts
and emotional energy of  my enemies. Through the Power of my Oversoul, I am
protected in a Pillar of Night Energy  and cannot be harmed.  May this Night
Pillar remain around me at all times keeping me  out of harms way.  So be it."

Say this invocation and visualize the Night Pillar around you until you can
feel its  protection. This energy comes from the Oversoul within.  As you
begin the invocation the  Oversoul extends the Night Energy into your world
through the silver cord. The silver cord  is your life line to your Oversoul
and through it all energy passes to you which sustains  your life on Earth.
You can invoke more of this energy and power into your life when you  work in
conscious union with your Oversoul.  There are many different kinds of energy
which can be invoked into your world through the Oversoul.  The Night Energy
of  Protection is only one of them.  You will learn about many more types of
energy you can  invoke and use towards the end of the book. What you want to
remember about the Night  Pillar is to use it often.

Always place the Night Pillar around you before you work Night Magick.  Always
place yourself in the Night Pillar at the beginning of each day.  The more you
use it the stronger  it will become.  The Pillar will protect you from all
physical and psychic harm.  You must  learn to consciously keep the Night
Pillar around you all the time.  You should always  remain in the Night
Pillar.  Everything that you practice in the lore of Night Magick should begin
with the Night Pillar.  You must always do this whether it's stated so or not.
Through the Night Pillar you will safely live and learn in Night Magick.  You
now have  built a strong foundation upon which to live and practice Night
Magick. You have learned  what it is to be a Night Magician and to practice
the lore of Night Magick.  If you are ready  to begin using Night Magick then
let's consecrate your Night Study and Tools.

12.  Invocation to Night Magick  

This is a most sacred time in your life for it marks the beginning of your
entry into Night Magick.  You are going to perform a very sacred rite to mark
your entry.  You will, in this solemn rite, dedicate your physical, emotional,
mental, and magickal energies to the  practice of Night Magick.  This rite is
meant to convey to you the seriousness and  importance with which you should
view Night Magick.  In this rite, you will learn the basics  which will begin
every ritual you will learn.  In this rite, you will invoke the Night Energy
into your Night Tools and Weapons and make them yours and yours alone.  The
Night  Tools and Weapons will then be sacred and contain the Power of the
Night. To begin, you  must have your Magician's Study and Night Altar
prepared.

To do this, have all your Night Tools and Weapons laid out on the Night Altar.
Have the  cord laid on the floor in a circle around the Night Altar.  On the
Night Altar you should now  light the candles and the incense.  Your bowl
should be full of water and your chalice  should contain wine or grape juice.
Be sure and turn off the phones and lock the doors so  you won't be disturbed.
Once you have accomplished this be sure and have your Night  Name selected. It
is this name you will use in the performance of this rite.  Now for the actual
ritual.

You will begin by invoking the Night Pillar.  Standing before your Night Altar
and with your eyes closed see the Protective Night Energy pouring down from
the Oversoul above you,  through your head, on into your heart, and out into
the study completely surrounding and interpenetrating the room.  See the Light
continuing through you and on into the Earth.  At this point you should repeat
the Night Pillar Invocation given earlier.   Feel the Night  Energy
concentrate deeply within the circle boundary outlined by the cord.

Now pick up the bell and ring it six times in each major direction, that is
North, South,  East and West.  Then repeat the following invocation, "I who am
(give your Night Name)  summon the Presence of all Deities in the Night Force
to attend my ritual of Eternal Night.   To witness my consecration of my Night
Tools in the service of the Eternal Darkness.  We  now stand in the Eternal
Night beyond time and space.  Come and witness my Ritual of  the Night". After
this, pick up the salt container, and repeat the following: "By my sacred
name, (give your Night Name), through the Presence of my Oversoul and the
Eternal Earth  Deities, I invoke the Earth Night Power into this container of
salt and now place the salt  upon the earth to mark the boundary of my sacred
circle."  Visualize the Earth Deities  filling the vessel with their power.
Pinch a little salt lightly between your fingers dropping  it on the floor
over the cord going completely around the circle.  BE CAREFUL NOT TO STEP
OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE RITUAL.  Place the salt container
back on the Night Altar and pick up the crystal bowl of water. Repeat the
following: "May the Presence of my Oversoul and the Eternal Water Deities fill
this water and container and endow it with the Water Night Power." Visualize
the Water  Deities of the Earth filling the vessel with the power.  With your
left hand dip it into the  water and sprinkle lightly the boundary you have
already marked with the salt. Place the  water bowl back on the altar and pick
up the incense burner.

Repeat the following: "Let the Presence of the Four Winds of the Earth enter
into the  incense burner filling it with Air Night Power".   Now face each
direction, rotating  counterclockwise, and see the Presence of each Wind Deity
enter into the incense burner.   Then circle four times in a counterclockwise
manner around and within the Magick Circle.   Place the incense burner back on
the Night Altar and pick up the candle.

Repeat the following:  "May the Presence of my Oversoul and the Fire Deities
of the Earth  place their sacred flame here within my candles and upon my
Night Altar."   See the Fire  Deities come and dance around the flames and
upon your altar.  Place the candle back  where it came from and pick up the
chalice of wine or juice.

Repeat the following: "Let the Presence of my Oversoul and the Eternal
Darkness enter  into the liquid and fill it with the Power of the Eternal
Night.  May this elixir give me  strength, healing, and courage each day of my
life."  Feel the Power flow through you and  into the chalice.  See the energy
collect and concentrate till the chalice glows with Night  Energy.  Then drink
the liquid and your ready to consecrate the other Night Tools.

You will begin with the oil so pick it up and repeat the following: "Let this
oil be made  sacred and filled with the Power of the Night.  Let the Presence
of the Oversoul and Night  Spirit touch it with their might, courage,
solitude, and darkness.  For the oil is now sacred  and made for anointing the
Weapons of a Night Magician."   Take a small amount of oil  and touch the
Pentacle and state, "May the Night Force flow into this Pentacle and bless all
things laid on it". Now it is time to anoint each weapon in your sacred
arsenal.

You will pick up each Night Weapon, one at a time, and while placing a small
amount of  oil on each tool, repeat the following: "Through the Presence of my
Oversoul and the  Eternal Darkness, I (Night Name), consecrate this Night
Weapon in the service of Night  Magick and the Eternal Night."  Do this with
the Night Amulet, Ring, Wand, Staff,  Grimoire, Athame, Sword, Plate, Shield,
and Cape.   Now put the Night Amulet, Ring,  Plate, Athame and Sword on your
body.  Place the Grimoire in the front center edge of  your Night Altar.  Put
on the Night Cape. Place the Night Shield over your left forearm and  in the
left hand hold the Night Wand and in the right hold the Night Staff and state
the  following:  "I,(give your Night Name), commit my all to the Oversoul and
the Night Spirit  within, and to the dedication of my Magickal Energies to the
practice of Night Magick.  I  dedicate myself to the Oversoul within and to my
union with it in Night Consciousness.   May these Night Tools and Weapons
serve me ever in this cause. So be it."  Now face  each direction and repeat
the following:  "Thank you Night Deities for your attendance at  this sacred
Night Rite.  May we ever serve the Eternal Powers of Darkness here on Earth
and the Omniverse forever. So be it."  And that's it, you have finished your
first night rite  and all your Night Tools and Weapons are consecrated in
Night Magick.  At this point stop and re-enforce your Night Pillar and then
take off all your Night Weapons and place them  back upon the Night Altar.
Leave the cord in place on the floor.

Each ritual will begin by your stepping into the Night Circle and putting on
your Night Weapons and Cape.  It is alright if you wear your Night Amulet and
Ring outside the  Circle. After this place the Night Pillar around you.  Do
not leave the Circle until the end  of the ritual and be sure and re-enforce
the Night Pillar around and through you before  leaving the Night Circle.  Go
through the actions of consecrating the Night Circle with  earth, water, air,
and fire each time.  Fill the chalice, say the invocation, and drink the  wine
each time.  Then always ring the bell and summon the Night Deities.   These
are the  basic procedures you will begin each ritual which takes place within
the Night Circle.  I  hope you have had fun and are ready to begin learning
about the first realm you will pass  through on the Night Road.  Let's go then
to the Earth Realm.

CHAPTER IV


Earth Magick

13.  The Earth Realm  

Since time began there has been traditionally four elements which make up the
world of  the Night Magician.  These are the elements of Earth, Water, Air,
and Fire.  They are  symbolic for the basic four worlds of being: that of the
physical(Earth), emotional(Water),  mental(Air), and causal(Fire).  The
Oversoul must express through each of these realms  using the appropriate
vehicle or body and ultimately gain mastery over each of them. So, I  have
divided Night Magick into four basic realms with knowledge, exercises, and
rituals  appropriate to each realm. Ultimately, the Oversoul, through you,
working in and  mastering each realm will have learned all that must be
learned here upon Earth and  return no more.  The Earth Realm is your
beginning point in becoming a Night Magician.    I want to take you back to
the beginning of time and the origin of the soul.

From an understanding of general cosmology, that is the origin of the Void,
Monad/Godsoul/Oversoul and the soul of humankind, then this will help you to
see the  whys of a magickal evolution and the reasons for being on the Night
Road that follows this  magickal evolution.

There is no beginning to the origin of the Void.  The Void has always been, is
now, and  ever will be.  The Void is principle, unmanifest, and exists
entirely in itself, from itself, and  by itself. The Void is the potential and
unmanifest Source of all that exists.  The Void is  the Life present in all
things.  It is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient.  From out of  the
Void, the potential and unmanifest Source, comes the Ultimate Yin and Yang
Creators.   The Spirit of the Spirits.   The Ultimate Spirits are the first
and only creations  by the Void.  The totality of all that the Void can be is
brought into being in the Ultimate  Spirits.  The Ultimate Spirits derive all
potential and essence from the Void, the potential  and unmanifest.  The
Ultimate Yin and Yang then created twin parallel matrixes and so it  began.
What is now referred to here is also applicable for the Ultimate Yang.

The Ultimate Yin created beings like unto itself.  Each of these Beings I will
refer to as a Monad.   Each Monad was created in order to share in the joy of
creation with the  Ultimate Yin.  The Eternal Night gave to each Monad the
potential of becoming all that It  is.  The Dark Goddess-God gave to each
Monad the essence and potential for expressing  the Eternal Darkness.  Each
Monad evolves into the Oneness of the Eternal Night by  actualizing its
Eternal Night's potential.  Each Monad grows by bringing into  manifestation
the latent abilities and powers placed within It by the Eternal Night.  Like
the Eternal Night, each Monad is given the right of free will to determine how
it will do  this.  The free will of each Monad permits it to choose how it
will create and what path of  evolvement to follow.  When the Monad chooses to
manifest its Abilities and Powers and  to Create, the way of interest to you
as a Night Magician, is by its descent into matter.

The material universe is made up of an infinite number of vibrational
energies.  The very highest of these energies is the substance upon which the
Monad first creates.  Through  the Creative Power of the Monad, acting on the
highest vibrational matter, the Monad first  takes on form.  This is not form
as you understand form but something that is beyond your understanding. When
the Monad first takes on form, it becomes two Godsouls.

The two Godsouls are true twin souls.  They are the magickal twins who shall
evolve and  create together by the Will and Power of the Monad.  They each
have free will and free  choice of their own.  Yet all creation that proceeds
from them is related.  All fragments of  their divine spirit which are sent
forth to be ensouled in the world of spirit and matter are  thus related and
united in purpose.  In all they do the twin souls are united through the  Will
of the Monad.   One Godsoul is predominately Yin with Yang and the other is
totally  Yin.  This is a simplification of the energy systems but basically
these twin Godsouls now  have the creative energies ready to continue downward
into material creation.  Each  Godsoul has the full potential and essence of
the Monad and also the free will to use  them.  Because of the power and high
vibrational energies of the Godsoul it cannot  continue its direct descent
into matter, thus it created an extension of itself into the lower  worlds.
This level of presence I have called the Oversoul.  The Oversoul is a being of
lower vibrational levels.  It is very active on its levels in  learning and
creating and using the potential given to it by the Godsoul.  Ultimately, the
Oversoul must learn to create on the lowest of levels and thus it sends a part
of itself into  the lowest worlds of form and so is born the soul.

The soul is the instrument through which the Oversoul learns about the lowest
worlds of creation.  The human soul will return to the Earth many times for
the human body does  not last long. The human soul will return to experience
many different lives in order that it  might gain all the experience the Earth
has to teach it.  Once the human soul has gained  all the experience the
Oversoul needs then the human soul will move on to different  worlds and
dimensions in order to gain new experience.  The soul gets its life force and
direction from the Oversoul.  This Power and Will flows through what is called
the Silver  Cord.  This Cord is made up of high energy particles through which
flows energy of  varying frequencies.  The soul operates through a mental,
emotional or astral, etheric,  and physical body.  On Earth this is the human
body.

The Soul (Oversoul and soul) is very delicate and composed of very high
vibrational  energies. If the Soul is to grow, develop, and evolve in material
creation then it has to  have a material vehicle through which to work.  You
could compare this to a person who  wants to go into outer space.

Because outer space is very cold, lacks oxygen, and is a vacuum the human body
could  never withstand going out into space without being protected from it.
So a special suit is  designed which is heated, pressurized, and contains
oxygen with which to breathe. It also  contains many devices and sensors to
work in space and monitor the surroundings.  In  order to protect the delicate
Soul from the dense material surroundings, and for it to be  able to work in
and monitor its surroundings a special suit was devised. This is called the
physical body.

The physical body is composed of the lowest and densest matter. It is designed
to  respond and interact with its material surroundings.  There are the five
senses: sight,  touch, smell, taste, and hearing; and their respective organs:
eyes, skin, nose, mouth, and  ears.  These allow the soul to react to the
world around it.  The hands, arms, legs, feet,  and joints allow the soul to
work with its surroundings with great dexterity and ability.  The  physical
body is an excellent tool through which the soul to operate when it is
properly  attuned and under the control of the Oversoul.  Unfortunately, for
the majority of  humankind this is not the case.

Too many human beings are the human body instead of the soul and Oversoul. The
Oversoul/soul is not in charge but it is the human body which is in charge.
The human  body is basically undisciplined and unruly.  Whatever the human
body wants it gets and  half the time it doesn't really want what it thinks it
wants. Without the control of the  Oversoul/soul, the body is helpless before
the elements of life.  The human body has no  control over the world around
it.  Because of this current state, the Oversoul/soul does not pay attention
to the human body.  It is much like a car out of control.  If you were the
driver of a car that refused to go where you wanted it to go and was always
headed for  destinations unwanted and going past places uncared about, you
would get out and just  let it go till it crashed and burned. This is pretty
much what the Oversoul/soul does  concerning the human body. But there is a
way to change this. You must identify, tune  into, and become the
Oversoul/soul.

You must gain mastery over the physical body.  You are the Oversoul/soul and
not the  physical body.  You must remember that you are eternal and only
working through the  physical body.  It is your tool through which to work and
experience the material world  around you.  You cannot allow the passions and
desires of the body to rule you.  You  must develop control over the body.
Properly channeled and controlled these forces can  be used to your advantage
instead of your detriment.  You will learn through Night Magick  how to
develop this control and mastery.  The Night Magician must attain through
discipline, diet, exercise, and ritual mastery over her/his body and the world
around  her/him. But in all trials that occur in your life be easy on
yourself. You will fail many times, but get up, dust off your knees, and go on
vowing to try and do  better. Never give up for all things are possible to
those who follow the Night Magician's  life.   "The world is but a stage and
we are the actors upon it,'' thus it was said by  Shakespeare.  This world is
but an illusion and your attitude should be that of "in it but  not of it".
You must never become lost in the illusion of the game played by the majority
of humankind.  You must become the Master of Illusion, the Night Magician. Let
me  discuss with you for a moment the Stage upon which we experience life.
