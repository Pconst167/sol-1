                       A new Technique for Viewing the Aura

       Back in the  mid 70's, I was asked to design equipment to be used in
       locating the Lost Hall of Records associated with the Giza Complex
       of the Great Pyramids.

       An amateur archeologist in Omaha  where  I  lived  at  the  time had
       translated some ancient Eqyptian documents.  One  of  the  documents
       told of how  the  Hall  would  be  found in the future.  It said the
       records, which detailed many of the  lost  secrets  of  the hows and
       why's of pyramid construction, would be found by  a  type  of energy
       they radiated.

       From my experience  with  the research of Wilhelm Reich, I instantly
       recognized the type of energy radiation  described  in those ancient
       texts.  It was  a  perfect  description of Orgone Energy,  the  life
       force or Bio-Energy surrounding all living things.

       Only this was  a  more  concentrated  form  of  the energy.  It even
       described aspects of Orgone that had  not been previously described.
       For example, it described light as waves upon the  water,  but  this
       energy was like water currents BENEATH the surface.

       It even went  on  to  say  how this energy was CONCENTRATED in DISK-
       SHAPED fields around planets and  accounted  for  the  rings  around
       planets (and this  was  thousands of years before the  discovery  of
       planetary rings!)

       Anyway, I successfully constructed a number of devices to detect the
       orgone.  Unlike Reich,  I  had  the  advantage of being able to work
       with more advanced  technologies,   like  Field  Effect  Transistors
       (FET's) instead of vacuum tubes.

       After several months, my job was done.  I had created  several small
       detectors capable of  detecting  orgone or life energy at a distance
       of 10 meters.  From the description of the Hall of Records energies,

                                      Page 1





       the energies put  out  by the Hall would be MUCH STRONGER and easier
       to detect.  Unfortunately, the group  intending  to  go to Egypt did
       not get the financing needed for their trip.

       The weird thing is that no one seemed to care about  the life energy
       detection devices I had made.  They became a toy to amuse myself and
       my friends and not much more, until a few years ago.

       Again a technological  breakthrough enabled me to use the techniques
       I had already used to take the process one step further.

       Thanks to computer imaging processes,  new  types  of  CCD's (charge
       coupled detectors that can image different types of  electromagnetic
       fields), and high frequency, high voltage induction devices (nothing
       new - they were pioneered nearly a century ago by Tesla), I was able
       to get STUNNING images of the AURA.

       At first, the  images were quite crude, but in time they got better.
       Now I can  image the aura and the  CHAKRA'S  (spinning  vortices  of
       energy located from  the tip of the spine to the top  of  the  head,
       they are 7  in  number  and control different types of energy within
       the body).  These Chakra's show up  in  FULL COLOR with exposures of
       less than 15 seconds.

       I have also imaged other odd things including what  one  might  call
       ghosts, and points  and  spheres  of  light  that  so far I have not
       figured out.

       I am sharing  some  of  these images  here  on  CompuServe,  perhaps
       someone knows where the project should be taken from this point.

       In one of the images, the woman is trying to astral  project, you'll
       notice her aura  shifted  from  it's normal position around her body
       and afterwards she described being  outside  herself  - but not very
       far.

       What should I  do  now?   I  am  currently successfully  working  on
       another aspect of  this work to enhance the aura.  I have included a
       before and after picture of my friend  Leon  before  and  after this
       enhancement process.

       Leon is a  Reiki  Master and told of a tremendous  increase  in  his
       healing powers for  several days after the enhancement.  Please feel
       free to write me.

       Vangard Notes....

          On Wednesday, July 1st, I had the  distinct  pleasure of speaking
          with Chuck Shramek.  Chuck works as a newscaster  for  a  Houston
          radio station  and is an active Ham and shortwave radio operator.
          He has been experimenting with  electronics for over 20 years and
          has 5 computers, several radio systems, scopes and numerous other
          lab equipment.



                                      Page 2





          Chuck tells  me that he began experimenting with Orgone Detectors
          about 20 years ago while studying  the  research notes of Wilhelm
          Reich.  For  those  who  are  unfamiliar  with  Reich,   KeelyNet
          currently has  two  files  (both pro and con regarding his work),
          they are REICH1 and REICH2.

          Reich was  thrown  in prison  for  what  many  believe  to  be  a
          conspiracy promoted by the AMA as punishment for  his  successful
          "cures" of cancer and other diseases using his Orgone Box.  It is
          odd that  our  government would take further steps which included
          the BURNING OF REICH'S BOOKS  to  prevent  dissemination  of  his
          research work.  This took place in the 1950's, what  should  have
          been an enlightened time.

          At any  rate,  Chuck  got  the idea of building a two dimensional
          scanning system which involved  the  movement  of a single Orgone
          detector in  an  X,Y grid.  At each point, the intensity  of  the
          field was recorded which yielded a tediously derived image of the
          Aura of  the body.  Chuck said that process took at least an hour
          with the subject lying prone and still on a table.  The images so
          derived were of very low resolution.

          We discussed the technique and the multiple applications to which
          this infant technology could  be  applied.   In  the  process,  I
          offered my  ideas on JUST HOW the images were produced  since  we
          understood it to have been through the use of a video camera.

          Those ideas  included his mention of an enhancement process which
          stimulated the body.  From that,  I had assumed from Reich's work
          that the  subject  sat  inside  an orgone box which  charged  his
          system with  a  high concentration of orgone energy.  The subject
          then stood on an electrical plate  which allowed the orgone to so
          modulate the corona as to generate the aura image.

          Chuck says close but not exactly correct.  The  process  in  fact
          USES NO ORGONE detectors.  Instead, the subject stands on a metal
          plate that is driven from a Tesla coil.

          This coil  is  fed  with  a  "swept" range of low level microwave
          frequencies that in turn stimulate  the body field.  The image is
          picked up using a special CCD that is sensitive and tuneable to a
          wide range of frequencies ranging from microwaves to low IR.

          Chuck further specified that the images that you  see  with  BOTH
          the visible  picture  of  the  subject AND the field are NOT TRUE
          IMAGES!

          This is  because  the  CCD  that  picks  up  and  translates  the
          microwave stimulated fields will NOT PICK up the VISIBLE IMAGE of
          the subject.  So what you actually see is the image  of  the Aura
          without a body and the Charkras suspended in space.

          To make  the true image, the subject is simultaneously videotaped
          with a standard video camera.   That visible image is then super-
          imposed on  top of the actual aura field to yield  the  composite
          images that we see.

          Chuck says  these  images are very low resolution (320 X 200) and
          that he has since expanded to VGA standards.

                                      Page 3





          Currently, Chuck is trying to figure out what the glowing spheres
          are that   periodically   appear  in  the  exposures.   Note  the
          exposures take about 15 seconds  each, so there is great room for
          improvement towards a movie type system.

          Also in regard to Reich, in his papers regarding work with BIONS,
          Reich reports  that  they  emit  some kind of UV  radiation  that
          resulted in burning of the eyes and in fact would tan tissue that
          was exposed  to  the BION emanations.  This is quite possibly due
          to a very high concentration of  Orgone energy which leads one to
          the conclusion  that  a human body could be so  charged  that  it
          would emit  a  high  degree  of  such  UV  radiation  and  so  be
          detectable by solid state imaging techniques.

          Yet another related detector is  the Sergeyev life field detector
          as mentioned  in the book, Psychic Discoveries  Behind  the  Iron
          Curtain.  These  detectors  could  sense  the  presence of living
          tissues (human) for a distance  of  up  to  100  feet and through
          walls.  A  physicist  friend  of ours from Washington  says  that
          several years  ago,  the Nielsen company (does TV ratings) made a
          public announcement  of  a new  method  of  getting  the  overall
          response of a crowd to a new TV show.

          This friend said that a detector (or array of such) was placed in
          another room and directed to monitor the audience  response  to a
          new show  or  program.   It  was  far  superior to the old rating
          system that required a checksheet,  because it directly monitored
          the emotional state of the crowd in a composite fashion.

          We also  know  of  many people who believe that  a  reliable  and
          reproducible method  of detecting the aura would lead to advanced
          medical diagnostic techniques.   Since  it  is  believed that the
          body is  controlled  and fed by an energy meridian  system,  then
          there would  be  areas  of  greater  or  lesser energy that would
          result in  an  imbalance.  Such  an  imbalance  would  alter  the
          function of the organ under its influence, leading  to illness or
          dysfunction.  Such a system would allow instant targeting of such
          an area and show in a direct way, what effect acupuncture or such
          energy flow modification techniques produce.

          Ron even  suggested  the imaging of someone at the point of death
          to try to capture whatever leaves  the  body.   This would really
          shake up  religions worldwide and open many doors  into  research
          into communicating  with discarnate entities.  And of course, one
          could capture  images of paranormal  events  that  currently  are
          quite difficult if not impossible to achieve.

          Of course, much more verification of this work needs to be done.
