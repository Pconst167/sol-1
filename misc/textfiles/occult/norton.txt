                      > EMPEROR NORTON - LIVE LIKE HIM <

Joshua Norton, or as he preferred to be called, Norton I, proclaimed himself 
Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico in 1859. 

Although a pauper, he was fed free in San Francisco's best restaurants. 

Although a madman, he had all his state proclamations published in San 
Francisco newspapers. 

While rational reformers elsewhere failed to crack the national bank monopoly 
with alternate currency plans, Norton I had his own private currency accepted 
throughout San Francisco.  

When the Vigilantes decided to have a pogrom against the Chinese, and sane men 
would have tried to stop them, Norton I did nothing but stand in the street, 
head bowed, praying. The Vigilantes dispersed.  

            "When the proper man does nothing (wu-wei), his thought
                         is felt ten thousand miles." 
                                  -- Lao Tse

Although a fool, Norton I wrote letters which were seriously considered by 
Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria.  

                 "You must take the bull by the tail and look 
                            the facts in the face."
                                -- W.C. Fields

Although a charlatan, Norton I was so beloved that 30,000 people turned out 
for his funeral in 1880. 

                   "Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. 
                    Few understand Hermann Hesse. 
                    Hardly anybody understands Einstein.
                    And nobody understands Emperor Norton."
