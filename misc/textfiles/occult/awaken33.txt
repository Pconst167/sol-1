1874 - WHAT THE WATCH TOWER BIBLE AND TRACT SOCIETY OF PENNSYLVANIA
       HAD TO SAY ABOUT WHAT WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE HAPPENED THEN.
 
This issue will comprise mainly of quotes from Watch Tower publications.
Present day Jehovah's Witnesses are unlikely to be aware of any of this
material. Why ? The Watch Tower had changed it's theology and does not
bother to let it's followers know facts about the past especially since
the present theology is totally contradictory to what was promoted in the
past. Both sets of incompatible conjectures were promoted as being found 
and proven in Scriptures. Prior to 1943 if a follower of the Watch Tower
questioned any of the Watch Tower's teaching about 1874, that person
risked getting kicked out of the group thus risked being shunned by
his/her family and any friends who followed the Watch Tower. After 1943
the teaching regarding 1874 was totally changed by the Watch Tower.

1891, from page 234 :

     "...the Scriptural declaration that the Millenium of peace and 
     blessing would be introduced by forty years of trouble, beginning
     slightly in 1874 and increasing until social chaos should prevail
     in 1914"
 
Watchtower, Jan. 15, 1892, from page :
     "The date of the close of that 'battle' is definitely marked
     in Scripture as October, 1914. It is already in progress, its
     beginnings dating from October, 1874"


Watchtower, Dec. 01, 1916, from page 5998 :
     "Pastor Russell...believed and taught that we are living in the
     time of the second presence of our Lord, and that his presence
     dates from 1874"
 

Watchtower, Sept. 15, 1922, from page 278 :
     "No one can properly understand the work of God at this time
     who does not realize that since 1874, the time of the Lord's
     return to power, there has been a complete change in God's
     operations"

Watchtower, Mar. 01, 1923, from page 67 :
     "The Scripture show that the second presence was due in 
     1874...This proof shows that the Lord has been present since 1874"


Watchtower, Jan. 01, 1924, from page 5 :
     "Surely there not the slightest room for doubt in the mind of
     a truely consecrated child of God that the Lord Jesus is present 
     and has been since 1874"


The Watch Tower maintained that Jesus's second coming occured in 1874.
This was in effect until 1943 when the new book "The Truth Shall Make
You Free" was published. From then on the theology and chronology as
presented by the Watch Tower changed and it's followers were expected
to again NEVER question what the Watch Tower was teaching.
 
The Truth Shall Make You Free, first published in 1943, from page 152 :
     "From Adam's creation to the end of 1943 A.D. is 5971 years. 
     We are therefore near the end of six thousand years of human
     history"
 

God's Kingdom Of A Thousand Years Has Approached, first published
in 1973, from pages 209-210 :
     "In the year 1943...published the book The Truth Shall Make You
     Free...This moved forward the end of six thousand years of man's
     existance into the decade of the 1970's. Naturally this did away
     with the year 1874 C.E. as the date of the return of the Lord
     Jesus Christ"
 
This is a perfect example of why I wonder how anyone can trust any
chronology as presented by the Watch Tower. Scripture was said to
show that the second presence BEGAN in 1874. The Millenium also
began in 1874, with the return of Christ. The Watch Tower stated
that the clergy did not agree with the Watch Tower about Christ's 
second presence beginning in 1874, because they were being
influenced by Satan. 

The Watch Tower's present day teaching regarding 607 B.C.E. are not
supported by ANY Archaeological evidence found since the middle of the
last century. 
 
The Watch Tower's present day teaching regarding 1914 is totally 
different from what it taught in the past.
 
As I have shown above, the Watch Tower's present day teaching about 1874
differs dramatically from what was taught as the truth in the past.
 
Yet, Jehovah's Witnesses will cheerfully claim that they are members in 
the Truth. I guess that would depend on some new definition of the Truth,
because it sure does not match the dictionary definition of Truth. If Jesus
did not return in 1874, then for OVER FIFTY YEARS the Watch Tower had
MISLED it's followers. The Watch Tower's present day chronology which
is fixed on the date of 607 B.C.E. for the destruction of Jerusalem is
INVALID and the Watch Tower KNOWS. There is NO EVIDENCE to support the
date 607 B.C.E. ALL THE EVIDENCE points to 586-587 B.C.E. Again, the
Watch Tower knows it (see the file AWAKEN31.ZIP for complete details),
but they totally disregard such facts.
 
How can Jehovah's Witnesses be sure that the Watch Tower is not still
misleading them as was the case with 1874. Any Encyclopaedia will show
that Jerusalem was destroyed in 586-587 B.C.E. There is no evidence that
Jehovah's Witnesses are in the Truth. Quite the contrary, it seems that
they can never be sure of what exactly the Truth is, since the Watch Tower
given time can and has changed what it presented as being Truth.

George Orwell, in his classic book 1984, wrote :
     "The key word here is BLACKWHITE...Applied to a Party member, 
     it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when 
     Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability 
     to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black
     is white, and to forget that one ever believed the contrary."
 
     "The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.
     It was their final, most essential command."

Please share the info found in these issues of AWAKEN with other
members of the faith to which you belong. Consider using this
info within publications issued to members of your faith. One
example is to use this info within Church bulletins. People need
to become informed about the Watch Tower and it's teachings. Why ?
Jehovah's Witnesses go door to door preaching whatever the
Watch Tower has told them to preach. They are trained weekly to
respond to any and all objections to their preaching. They are
told by the Watch Tower that the Watch Tower is the only TRUTH
and that the Watch Tower is the only TRUE religion. They are 
told by the Watch Tower that all other faiths, teach
false teachings because all other faiths are agents of SATAN.
They have no qualms attacking any and all aspects your belief
system, when they come on their un-asked for visits. They are
trained to SELL you on the Watch Tower's teachings, just as they
themselves had been SOLD. 

By becoming informed about the Watch Tower, one will be better 
prepared to decide whether one should get involved with this group.
