Preface

This little book has been written in the spirit of 
Suggestive Inquiry, and the writing of it has led to 
many illuminating ideas in regard to the Universal 
Tradition as disclosed by the Tarot Trumps.

Some months ago, I prepared a treatise entitled 
"Q. B. L. or The Bride's Reception," purporting to be a 
simple exposition of the Qabalistic Process and an 
explanation of "The Tree of Life" with its 
Correspondences according to the system I had studied 
and practiced for a number of years.

While writing it I obtained some "New" ideas which 
seemed to indicate the possibility of the Restoration 
of the Order of the "Paths" to their Original form. 
These ideas I put down as they came to me, and included 
them as an Appendix to the main body of the book.

Briefly, the nature of the suggested change was as 
follows: The Qabalistic Tradition of the last few 
centuries is that the "Ten Sephiroth", or "Numerical 
Emanations", were formed by the "Lightning Flash" of 
Creation, while the "Twenty-two Paths" were produced by 
the Ascent of the "Serpent of Wisdom" from Malkuth to 
Kether.

The recognized Numeration of these Paths was from 
Number Eleven, transmitting the Influence from Kether 
to Chokmah, to Number Thirty-two, transmitting it from 
Yesod to Malkuth the Tenth and last Sephira.

I questioned this, since the Serpent is said to 
have _Ascended_, and suggested that the Eleventh Path 
should be from Malkuth to Yesod, and so on up the Tree 
in exactly the reverse Order.

Upon experimenting with this arrangement I 
discovered that although there seemed to be a decided 
improvement as regards the Paths below the Abyss, above 
it, all the symbolism became reversed and confused. 
Even so, there were some interesting combinations.

The main point was, however, that the new 
arrangement of the lower Paths suggested the 
possibility of a wonderful Astrological Harmony, since 
many of them were now united with their Planetary 
Rulers, etc., in the Sephiroth.

The next step was the discovery of the Symbolism 
of the Middle Pillar, when the Three Mother Letters of 
the Elements were attributed to the Three Paths which 
unite the Four Sephiroth which are in equilibrium. 
These, when placed in position, showed the Symbolism of 
the Universal Mercury under the form of a Caduceus and 
Winged Globe.

I decided, therefore, to adopt this arrangement of 
the Three Elements, and to try to place the Planetary 
and Zodiacal Signs in such positions on the Tree that 
the Astrological Symbolism would be perfect.

I discovered that this was possible. There was one 
variation, which, if adopted, disclosed some other 
valuable Qabalistic Symbolism in regard to "The 
Beginning". I explained this fully in the Appendix to 
Q.B.L. With my original notes left in their rough form, 
I published the complete book in a limited edition for 
Students of the Qabalah. This has met with a very good 
reception in all parts of the globe. I have received 
many encouraging letters, all of which express interest 
in the revised arrangement. The press reports have been 
favourable, and a conservative Magazine "The Occult 
Review" admits the importance of the discovery.

One great Authority, however, while admitting that 
many of the ideas are brilliant, says that he cannot 
accept this Reformed Order in the face of several 
hundred years of the old tradition, and maintains that 
the previous arrangement is the correct one.

While I realize that great changes in the 
recognized Systems of Initiation in certain Orders 
might be necessary if the Reformed Order of the Paths 
were adopted, and while recognizing the importance of 
the opinion of the Authority mentioned above, I still 
maintain that this New Arrangement is worthy of the 
most careful consideration and study. One would expect 
to find some reason for the arrangement of the Paths, 
and this present plan seems to me the most reasonable; 
in fact it suggests that there was an Absolute Reason 
in the Primitive Universal Tradition, though this 
became lost to view as time went on.

My aim is to discover the Truth insofar as that is 
possible to man, and to uphold what seems to me most 
true, until I am convinced of error; but, to change my 
viewpoint, if necessary, as soon as more Light is given 
me. If this "New" arrangement is correct, it will prove 
itself to be so in the minds of those who study it in 
an unbiased manner. In any case it is of interest as 
one aspect of truth, and its right place may be found 
in due course. It may lead the Student to other 
important discoveries as it has in my own case. I am 
convinced that the enquiry is by no means exhausted.

The Tarot Trumps, being a sort of Universal 
Alphabet, may of course be interpreted in a variety of 
ways, but I shall discuss their Symbolism when arranged 
upon the Paths of the Tree of Life according to the 
Reformed Astrological Order given in the Appendix to Q. 
B. L.

If by this means we obtain "More Light on the 
Tarot Trumps" and the Universal Tradition, which 
transcends what we call Light and Darkness, becomes 
plainer to my readers, the book will not have been 
written in vain.

Before discussing the matter in detail, I am 
giving a brief summary dealing with the earliest 
traditions of Mankind and their effect upon the present 
day, or the New Aeon, the Cycle of Aquarius, in which 
we are not living. 

I trust that this book will lead to further Light 
on the very vital issues of this present Age, and 
perhaps to a solution of some of the most perplexing 
problems.

At least, I hope so.

Chapter I

Light on the Egyptian Revival

The more than ordinary interest displayed by all 
classes of people in the recent discoveries connected 
with the opening of the Tomb of King Tutankhamen, 
indicates, what may be termed, an Egyptian Revival.

This, to some, may appear quite unaccountable; in 
fact one of the popular writers in the daily papers has 
questioned just why the public should suddenly show 
such great interest in this particular discovery, while 
many similar ones have created little or no stir at 
all.

There may be a very deep underlying reason for 
this, and in order, if possible, to discover the hidden 
causes it will be necessary for us to make a brief 
survey of the Egyptian Current of Thought from the 
earliest times to the present day.

Again, we do not find the public interest centered 
alone in the treasures found in the tomb of 
Tutankhamen, but in nearly every instance reference is 
made to his immediate predecessor King Amenhatep IV, or 
to use his more familiar title King Khu-en-Aten.

King Khu-en-Aten is reported to have been the 
first King to attempt the establishment of a 
Monotheistic Religion in Egypt, and the Worship of the 
Aten or Solar Disk; whereas, after his death, 
Tutankhamen is said to have re-established the old 
order and the worship of Amen-Ra in place of that of 
Aten, or perhaps more properly Atum.

What was the cause of this controversy, and what 
is its bearing on the thought of the present day?

One of the immediate effects of the public 
interest in these matters has been the production of a 
charming little book by Robert Silliman Hillyer 
entitled "The Coming Forth By Day". This consists in a 
number of Hymns translated from the Egyptian "Book of 
the Dead", as it was erroneously called. But the chief 
item of interest is the introduction, giving a brief 
but sympathetic outline of The Egyptian Religion, which 
ends as follows: "For the mystics of the world have 
always, under all systems, escaped beyond the externals 
of faith, and held close to the Presence enthroned in 
the inner court of the temple; the same Presence in how 
many different sorts of temple! The God who walked by 
the Nile walks also among men today; whether we call 
him Christ or Osiris, whether we see him betrayed by 
Set or Judas, he is always here, he is always betrayed. 
Osiris was not the shadow cast before by the coming of 
Christ, nor Christ a remembrance of Osiris; they are 
the same, the same significance in different syllables 
over the earth. The machinery of religion changes, but 
whatever the modern man finds in his heart, that the 
Egyptian found also; for that is not the Christian 
Religion or the Egyptian religion; it is Religion, and 
the rest is merely an attempt to name that which is 
nameless."

We can hardly imagine a statement of this sort 
being made in a small, popular book a few years ago. It 
is surely a sign of the times and of the Influence of 
the Ever-coming Son, the Crowned Child, Lord of the New 
Aeon.

But Mr. Hillyer does not go back far enough into 
the past to throw the most truly significant light on 
the present and future. In order that we may properly 
understand the matter, we must delve deeply into the 
remotest times; somewhat in the way Gerald Massey did 
in the "Book of Beginnings." In fact his research work 
is invaluable, but unfortunately far too lengthy and 
recondite for the popular taste.

Let us then endeavor to piece together a few of 
the most vital and interesting fragments, so as to 
obtain, if possible, a bird's-eye view of the whole 
matter.

The beginning of mythology with the mother and boy 
is universal, and still survives in the Virgin and 
Child of Rome. The sonship preceding the fatherhood 
represents the most ancient form of belief, and when 
recognized in that light, is found to explain many of 
the early mysteries.

The first boy and his mother were called Sut-
Typhon. 

Sut means "The Opener", and this may be taken in 
the physiological as well as the astrological sense. 
The Child was the opener in the sense of being born of 
the un-mated Mother. The Sun is the Opener of the Day, 
while Sut as the Star-god was considered the Opener of 
the Year with the rising of Sothis, and on his rising 
was the Great Bear cycle founded.

The earliest conception of the great Mother was 
under the form of the Hippopotamus, the Devourer of the 
Waters. This led to that of the Water-Dragon, Typhon. 
But the Great Mother was She who brought forth the 
Starts, thus we find Her assuming the form of the Star-
Goddess, Nuit of the Heavens, who is represented by a 
beautiful human form arched over the earth. Her change 
to this human form was portrayed as "Beauty and the 
Beast in one Image", and from this was the ancient 
fable derived.

We find the Child described from the very earliest 
times, as of dual type, so that he became known as Sut-
Har or Sut-Horus. Later the idea of twins arose, and 
these became the Gods of the Two Horizons. Sut the 
Opener and Horus the one who Shuts or Closes. The 
earliest phenomenal form of these twins was as darkness 
(Sut) and light (Horus).

Har or Horus as the Sun was an earlier type than 
Ra who later became the principal Sun-god. Har, as the 
son of Typhon the Great Mother, became known as the 
earliest of the Pharaohs and rulers of Egypt.

Primarily the word Pharaoh is derived from Har-Iu, 
which means the Coming Son of a two-fold nature, and of 
the two (Iu) houses. This, again, was Har of the Shus-
en-Har or the Bar or Baal of the Heksus.

Now the rulers of the Shus were called Heks, and 
thus we may trace the early name of the God Hak which 
is a form of Harpocrates, the God of Silence, the Babe 
upon the Lotus; who is sometimes considered to be the 
twin of Horus, and concealed within him. 

Har-Makhu was the Star-God of both Horizons. Sut-
Har developed into the Solar Deity afterwards called 
Aten, or Atum. Thus we begin to see the Typhonian 
origin of the God Aten, and we shall learn from this 
something of the nature of the revival of Aten-worship 
under King Khu-en-Aten, the father-in-law of 
Tutankhamen.

But we first need some further links in our chain, 
and these may be supplied as follows:

As time went on there was mention of Four Suts, 
and the worship of the Mother Typhon and her son Sut 
began to fall into disrepute. A father was needed to 
account for the generation of all things, and gradually 
the idea of Tum the Old God of the Setting Sun arose, 
and he was said to be the Father of the Four Suts. 
(Thus the four Quarters were established, or perhaps 
the Equinoctial points and the Solstices). Tum then 
became known as Atum, and the Solar Fatherhood was 
established. Also the twin Lion-Gods assumed the type 
of Sut-Horus in Atum-Ra.

The quarrel which rent the monuments arose on 
account of Sut-Horus (Sut as brother of the Sun) and 
the Egyptian Amen-Ra who was identified with the Greek 
Jupiter-Amen. An alliance was made between the 
Ammonians and the Osirians against the followers of 
Sut-Har, or Sutekh or Sebek, and the ancient genetrix 
Typhon.

The taunt flung by the Osirians at the Sut-
Typhonians was "Orphan", intending to brand them as 
Fatherless in a religious sense because they worshipped 
only the Mother and the Child, who became looked upon 
as the Harlot and the Bastard.

This led to many unpleasant things being said on 
both sides, and we find a period when the followers of 
both forms or worship accused the others of every form 
of immoral practice.

We should now take up a slightly different angle 
of the situation. Atum was the same as the first Adam 
of the Hebrews. The Rabbins taught rightly that their 
typical Adam, of the same name as the monkey Udumu, had 
carnal knowledge of every tame and wild beast that he 
could dominate, and was not satisfied until Eve was 
made for him.

Atum as the Second Adam represented the first 
purely Human Deity without any animal admixture. We now 
get a glimpse of one of the reasons for the strange 
half-animal half-human types found in the ancient 
doctrines. There is another explanation of this, 
however, which will be discussed later. At the same 
time we begin to see how it was that King Khu-en-Aten, 
who revived the early traditions, had many purely human 
figures made, quite unlike the other Egyptian Images, 
and that these came to light in the recent discovery of 
the Tomb of Tutankhamen, who preserved them.

We have made mention before of IU, which means 
Twin, or Dual being, male and female in one. As in the 
case of Pharaoh or Har-Iu, we again find IU as the root 
of the word Jew.

So, too, we find in Iu-Sif the origin of Joseph, 
of whom more anon.

We find in Unicorn, Sut the Sun and Typhon the 
genetrix, and how this type preceded the Bullock or 
Osiris.

Sebek (The Crocodile) was a form of IU-Sif, as 
well as Har-Makhu and Aten of the Disk, who were each 
the Iu of the two horizons, as Son of the Mother.

After the reign of King Apehpeh in Egypt, the 
religion again changed hands and there arose a "King 
who know not Joseph" i.e. who did not worship IU-Sif or 
the Coming Son.

IU, as the Genetrix, became IU-Pater or Jupiter; 
and IU the Son who Comes, became IU-Sus, or Jesus. The 
Ever Coming Son was the prototype of the Wandering Jew, 
originally a symbol of Eternal Youth.

If there is any historical Joseph to be found in 
the monuments he is Aiu. He was a protégé of Amenhetep 
III.

This King was of the Black Aethiopian type, son of 
a black mother, but he married a fair wife. He was the 
father of Amenhatep IV, who changed his name of Khu-en-
Aten, or the Adorer of Aten. Amenhatep the IV's nurse 
was the wife of Joseph. On account of his parentage, 
Amenhatep IV was probably of a Reddish type, and the 
Aten whose worship he adopted was the Red Disk of the 
Sun. He may, however, have obtained a glimpse of the 
Concealed Father or Sun behind the Sun, and thus 
recognized that in one sense the old Sut-Typhonian 
tradition was nearer the truth than the prevalent 
worship of Atum Ra, or Amen Ra. He was of course 
misunderstood, most people thinking he had gone back to 
a dark and despised tradition. I shall endeavor to 
show, later on, how this confusion arose. We must 
remember that Atum was born as Horus or IU, child of 
the Mother and afterwards developed into Atum-Ra as God 
the Father. Hence he became the make of the Gods and 
men, the Begetter who succeeded his father Ptah. Atum 
means "Created Man" or Adam.

When the human soul had come to be considered as 
derived from the Essence of the Male instead of the 
Blood of the Female, the woman was naturally said to be 
derived from the man, as she is in the second of the 
Hebrew Creations described in Genesis. A soul derived 
from Atum was dual in sex. The soul was divided into 
Adam and Eve, the typical two sexes of the Hebrew 
legend.

Again it is recorded "When Horus had fulfilled the 
period of 2155 years with the Easter Equinox in the 
Sign of Aries, the birthplace passed into the Sign of 
Pisces, when the Ever-Coming One, the Renewer as the 
Eternal Child who had been brought forth as a Lion in 
Leo, a Beetle in Cancer, as one of the Twins in Gemini, 
as a calf in the Sign of the Bull, and a Lamb in the 
Sign of the Ram, was destined to manifest as the Fish, 
in the Sign of the Fishes. The rebirth of Atum-Horus, 
or Jesus, as the Fish Iusaas, and the Bread of 
Nephthys, was astronomically dated to occur in Beth-
Lechem -- the House of Bread -- about 255 B.C., at the 
time the Easter Equinox entered the Sign of Pisces, the 
house of Corn and Bread."

There had been a time when the two birthdays 
assigned to Horus of the Double Horizon, were allotted 
to the Child Horus in the Autumn, and to the Adult 
Horus at the Vernal Equinox; but when the Solstices 
were added to the Equinoxes, in the new creation of the 
Four Quarters established by Ptah for his Son Atum-Ra, 
there was a further change. The place of Birth for the 
Elder, the mortal Horus who was born of the Virgin 
Mother, now occurred in the Winter Solstice, and the 
place of Birth for Horus the Eternal Son was celebrated 
at the Vernal Equinox, with only three months between 
the two instead of six.

As above stated, the Entry of Horus into the Sign 
of Pisces occurred 255 B.C., and another period 2155 
years added to this, brings us down to the year 1900 
E.V. at which time Horus should astronomically be 
expected to appear in Aquarius. This is a purely Human 
Sign, the Sign of MAN, the Water-bearer or Bearer of 
the Waters of Life in his own person. 

In the year 1904 the Law for the New Aeon was 
received by one of the Adepts, and the reign of Horus 
duly proclaimed as Ra-Hoor-Khuit.

Since then many changes have occurred on the 
earth, and few can fail to recognize the coming of 
Horus in one of his aspects as the Avenger of his 
Father Osiris, so plainly manifested in the great World 
War, and in other ways. But Harpocrates, his twin, is 
hidden within Him, and we may look for the Crowned 
Child to be born in every Heart, during the Coming 
Period.

I have given this brief sketch, which is not by 
any manner of means complete, in order to prepare the 
mind of the reader for the explanation of the Universal 
Alphabet of the Book of Thoth, or the Tarot Trumps, in 
relation to their proper Paths on "The Tree of Life" of 
the Ancient Qabalah, as reformulated in my book Q. B. 
L.

I shall hope to show by this means that there is a 
still deeper meaning under all these things, that the 
Universal Tradition, long lost, may be revived to our 
great advantage in understanding not alone the Past, 
but the Present Period of the History of Mankind on 
this Planet.

But I shall first supply those who are unfamiliar 
with these ideas, with "The Essence of the Practical 
Qabalah," and even those who have read "Q. B. L." will 
do well to refresh their memories by a study of the 
brief outline which follows.



Chapter II

The Essence of the Practical Qabalah

It is not our intention that this chapter should 
represent a complete exposition of the Mysteries of the 
Holy Qabalah, but rather to give a brief outline of 
some of the principal doctrines which may lead the 
Student to a clearer conception of the value of the 
Qabalistic System as a method of drawing the Infinite 
within.

The Plan of the Ten Sephiroth, or Numerical 
Emanations, forms the basis of the Work, for, by 
erecting upon this foundation the scaffolding of our 
Temple, we may learn to restore our lost Equilibrium, 
thus canceling out the "Pairs of Opposites" which 
ordinarily obsess us. 

Briefly, this process may be described as follows: 
Prior to any manifestation, the Supreme was NOT. This 
being inconceivable, may yet be slightly apprehended if 
we consider the Air Suph or Infinite Space, followed by 
the potential existence of Infinite Light.

Only when we conceive this Infinite Light as 
concentrated upon a Central Point, does the first 
positive Idea arise. This Concentrated Light is called 
Kether -- The Crown -- the First Sephira. From this all 
else proceeds very much in the same way that Light may 
be broken up into the Colors of the Spectrum.

The next highest Idea is that of Wisdom, 
represented by Chokmah, the Second Sephira or 
Emanation. This is equivalent to the idea of the Logos, 
the Word of Creation which was in the Beginning with 
God and which was God. This is the great Creative Word 
-- the Divine Fiat -- and represents the Highest 
Intelligence of the Archetypal World. 

Next, co-equal with Wisdom, is Understanding, 
Binah the Third Sephira, the Highest Intuition which is 
capable of interpreting the Word correctly and of 
transmitting It to the lower Spheres. This is the 
Creative World of the Qabalah, the Great Mother 
Substance, energized by the Divine Will and Life.

These Three -- Light, Life, and Substance -- are 
the Supernal Triad, One and Indivisible. For Life is 
the substance of Light and the Second and Third 
Sephiroth are but aspects of the Living Substance which 
is Light Itself.

Next we come to the Formative World, composed of 
the following Six Emanations:

Chesed or Mercy, balanced by Geburah or Severity 
and forming thus Two Great Pillars which support the 
Arch of the Trinity. These balanced Ideas are 
harmonized in a third, the Sixth Sephira -- Tiphereth -
- which equilibrates them and is Itself called Beauty 
or Harmony. Following this we find the triad of 
Victory, Netzach, the Seventh Sephira; balanced by 
Splendor, Hod, the Eighth Sephira; and equilibrated by 
the Foundation, Yesod, the Ninth Sephira.

All the above are summed up in the Material World, 
the Tenth Sephira which is called Malkuth or The 
Kingdom. This sphere is pendant to the others; it is in 
reality One with Kether for all proceedeth from the One 
and is within the One. Yet in order that we may learn 
to comprehend the Nature of Unity, we must first 
contemplate the diverse and apparently complex. The 
limitations of Time, Space and Circumstance make this 
necessary to us at our present state of development.

But the ideal before us is to return to the Pure 
Conception of Unity, thus ridding ourselves of the 
Illusion of duality and accomplishing what is called 
The Great Work.

Had the Qabalistic Plan ended with the production 
of Malkuth the Kingdom or Material Universe, we should 
have been forced to admit that the creative process was 
one of degeneration. And so it Must appear to us from 
our limited viewpoint, until we have learned the Plan 
of Redemption and profited by it.

Chokmah, Wisdom or the Higher Will, is called The 
Father; Binah, Understanding or Intuition, represents 
the Great Mother; the next Six Sephiroth are centered 
in Tiphereth, The Son, and represent the Intellect; 
while Malkuth, The Kingdom or Animal Soul which 
perceives and feels, is called The Daughter.

The Daughter must marry the Son and so become the 
Mother, true mate of the Father, before all is re-
absorbed into the Crown of Light. In other words, by 
means of Intellect we may control our animal nature and 
eventually Understand through Intuition, which in turn 
is capable of receiving the Wisdom of the Father and 
thus making us true representatives of God upon Earth 
capable of doing His Will as it is done in Heaven.

The Qabalists further postulate a series of Graded 
Intelligences higher than Man. These are the Celestial 
Intelligences, the rulers of the Sephiroth. They 
reflect and re-produce the Divine Ideas, and also 
actively transmit them for the illumination of man and 
the control of Nature. Thus each is in itself both 
active and passive.

The Human reason is also active and passive. The 
reason proper is the active aspect, the passive side is 
usually termed intuition. This intuition is capable of 
absorbing truth from above and below. The active reason 
is capable of forming a thesis, antithesis, or 
synthesis in regard to the truths presented to it by 
the intuition.

The Nature-reason is to be found in the 
intelligibility and order of all natural things, 
according to their form and the material of which they 
are composed.

All corporeal things may be said to have a three-
fold existence. They exist as Ideas in the Mind of the 
Logos. Materially they exist in themselves, and 
Spiritually in the minds of Created Intelligences. It 
is important that we should grasp this three-fold idea 
of existence, as it makes many things clear that would 
otherwise be obscure to us.

If, for instance, we perceive a table, we should 
remember that since we are of the Order of Created 
Intelligences, the table exists Spiritually in us. What 
a table is in itself we do not know. Nor are we able to 
comprehend with certainty its Nature as an Idea in the 
Mind of the Logos.

Thus things may appear imperfect to us, while in 
truth they are perfect but for our limited idea of 
their nature.

The Great Work consists in correcting our 
distorted vision, thus making us capable of perceiving 
all things in the White Light of Truth, unrestricted by 
the limitations of our narrow outlook.

This may only be accomplished by our obtaining 
what may be termed a world-view or vision, free from 
distortion. The aim of all the Great Teachings is to 
give us such a view of the whole Creation, so that we 
shall be enabled to cooperate consciously in the 
fulfillment of the Divine Purpose.

Every Celestial Intelligence is said to be 
interiorly united with all things and to contain them 
in a spiritual manner. Thus the Great Work is to unite 
the Microcosm with the Macrocosm.

It is also said that every mundane intelligence is 
capable of taking all things into itself in a spiritual 
manner, and that in proportion to the extent to which 
this is accomplished does it become one with them. Here 
we have the key to the use of "The Tree of Life" or 
Qabalistic Plan of the Sephiroth and Celestial 
Intelligences. As we travel up the "Paths" of this 
"Tree" we must gradually absorb and so become One with 
all things in the universe in a spiritual manner. This 
must be accomplished by gradual steps, represented by 
the Grades of the Great Order. Each step taken must be 
fully mastered, ere we proceed to the next.

We must learn to balance and equilibrate all 
things as we go, for there may be no false summits in 
our Mystic Pyramid, nor missing spokes in the Great 
Wheel.

The Daughter, the nature-will, must be united to 
the Son, the personal-will which makes man more than 
mere animal, and gives him the power of choice. What is 
more, the Intellect -- or Son -- is naturally above 
Time and Space and is capable of containing time and 
space and all that is within time and space.

Thus, by means of Dhyana, does the Mystic 
transcend these limitations and becoming one with them 
absorbs them into himself. But the little "self" is no 
more, for he comprehends the nature of the Higher Self 
or Holy Guardian Angel. This is what is meant by the 
destruction of the ego; not a lessening of the 
conception of self but a recognition of the Nature of 
Self in its wider aspect.

The little self sees Nature as extremely complex; 
there are so many things to know that the task seems 
endless and impossible. The Qabalah teaches us to group 
all ideas according to their fundamental nature and 
correspondences, thus as we proceed, we are able to 
know a greater and greater number of things in the 
light of a smaller and smaller number of ultimate 
ideas. The thirty-two Paths of Wisdom enable us to 
classify all things in the universe in terms of thirty-
two; from that we go on reducing our ultimate ideas and 
increasing the field they cover, until Unity is 
reached.

The formula of 5 = 6 (that of the Adeptus Minor in 
Tiphereth) is represented by the Pentagram and the 
Hexagram. Man, the Microcosm is symbolized by the 
Pentagram composed of the Four Elements Crowned by 
Spirit. The Solar System is summed up in the Hexagram 
with its Planetary Correspondences, and this represents 
the Macrocosm.

Man must learn to draw the Macrocosm into himself, 
to absorb spiritually the Ideas represented by the 
Planetary and Solar Intelligences; thus may this part 
of the Work be accomplished. He obtains the Knowledge 
and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel or Higher 
Self. Beyond this, again, is the great Star Universe, 
wherein every man and every woman is a Star. He must 
absorb the Ideas of this Sphere, and at the same time 
recognize that every atom is a star in his own being. 
Thus at last will he come to Understanding, the Throne 
of the Great Mother.

Then will he, who is called Nemo, absorb the 
Wisdom of the Father, the Logos, so that in turn he may 
not only Understand but Will and Create according to 
the Divine Plan. He will then become Illumined by the 
One Light of the Crown upon his head; yet this, too, he 
must absorb so that Selflessness becometh Self and the 
Final stage of the Solve formula of the Great Work is 
accomplished. This Light must then penetrate deeper and 
deeper into Matter till the Plan of Creation is 
fulfilled.

Remember these words: Things exist because God 
knows them. Man knows things because they exist.

And again: Man ascends from things to ideas; God 
descends from Ideas to things.

Thus ye have the keys of the Great Gateway in your 
hands.

Now it is well that we should consider once again 
the very essence of the Qabalistic Process and the 
nature of its mystery of Number as the basis of all 
ideas.

If we can succeed in reducing our ideas to a 
numerical basis, we are better able to deal with them 
and to bring them back to Unity.

The Ten Sephiroth give us a basis of the decimal 
scale for all our main Ideas, which must be grouped 
accordingly. The Twenty-two connecting Paths, based on 
the letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which is itself 
numerical, enable us to link these ideas and to travel 
from one set to another with perfect ease and 
certainty. The Plan of the Four Worlds, The Archetypal, 
The Creative, The Formative, and The Material, enables 
us to increase the number of things known by 
considering the Sephiroth and Paths as existing in all 
of these simultaneously, yet at the same time to 
classify all Elemental ideas in terms of Four. These, 
crowned by Spirit, make the true Microcosm, Man the 
Pentagram. Our main Universal Ideas are to be summed up 
in the Hexagram as before said.  Unite the Pentagram 
and Hexagram and an Eleven-pointed Star give us the Key 
of the Aeon with its Word Abrahadabra as our Magick 
Formula. Thus we unite with the Word, the Logos, and 
finally with the Divine Breath which produced It.

Remember again the Qabalistic means of reducing 
all Words to their Numerical basis. For in Hebrew every 
word is also a number. Thus we may discover the Word 
and Number of our own being, and our place in the 
Creative Scheme. The correspondences between words of a 
similar numerical value will help us to form Galaxies 
of Stars, which are men and women, traveling in groups 
in a common direction, without friction, each in his 
proper orbit. Thus shall we come to comprehend the 
Mystery of the Starry Heaven, the Body of Our Lady 
Nuit. For as every atom in our bodies is itself a 
little solar system, so are we in the Body of the 
Mother of Heaven, and She is energized by the Invisible 
Point which is Not, yet which is the Life of All.

Remember too: The more universal ideas and reasons 
to which we attain, the nearer we approach to thinking 
the God Thought, which is the universe itself. There is 
but One true Thought, the ultimate Thought which is All 
Things. Normally, that which can be thought is not 
true, as the Hindus tell us, for until we reach the 
Smooth Point all things are but relative, and so is 
truth.

But: The Highest Reason, which is in God and which 
is God, is absolutely ONE. God knows all things by One 
Idea, which is identical with His Being.



Chapter III

More Light on the Tarot Trumps

In the Appendix to "Q. B. L. or The Bride's 
Reception" I have shown the possibility of arranging 
the Twenty-two Trumps of the Tarot on the Paths of the 
Tree of Life so that the Astrological Attributions are 
in perfect order, and I shall now trace out the 
Symbolism of the Cards themselves, and attempt to show 
that this arrangement is the Original one, long lost in 
the mists of antiquity.

The Diagram of the Tree of Life, with its 
attributions according to this re-arrangement, forms 
the basis of our present study.

Kether, The Crown of Light, is called AHIH or 
Eheieh which means Pure Being, that which Is, prior to 
"existence" or the "standing out" or "coming forth" of 
the manifested Universe. It is also call The Concealed 
of the Concealed, and the Supreme and Concealed One 
which is therefore Amoun. In Egyptian the hieroglyphic 
is two feathers, which represent AA. From this we 
obtain the idea of The One First and the One Last, 
similar to Alpha and Omega. This sign also represents 
the inherent idea of possible duality, or the apparent 
duplication of the One. But again it may be translated 
IU and is therefore the Root of "The Ever Coming One" 
of a dual nature. From this idea sprang that of IU-
Pater or Jupiter as the Father, and Io, the root of 
Jove or Jehovah, which also symbolizes the Number Ten, 
or the Ten Sephiroth inherent in the Being of the One.

Kether is also called the Sphere of the Primum 
Mobile, the First Whirling Motion. It represents the 
Living Substance; being potentially both Life and 
Substance in the Pure form of Light.

From Kether proceed the Ideas of the Father, 
Mother, and Holy Spirit or Son.

The First ray produced Yod, in Chokmah, the next 
He in Binah, and the third Vau in Tiphereth, and from 
this proceeded the final He, the Daughter, in Malkuth.

On the Path from Kether to Chokmah is the Tarot 
Trump called "The Wheel of Fortune," the Key of Destiny 
which is one with the True Will, and also, some say, 
with Chance. This is the Card of Iu-Pater, Jupiter the 
Father, and it symbolizes the Great Wheel of Life; the 
Whirling Forces of the Primum Mobile, which resulted in 
a System of Revolving Orbs, the Star Universe or Sphere 
of the Zodiac, in Chokmah.

This Card depicts the Three Principles of Alchemy, 
Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt; the Three Gunas, Satva, 
Rajas and Tamas; the three forms of Force, Radiation, 
Conduction and Convection; the States of Peace, 
Activity, and Sloth. These are symbolized by the 
Sphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon upon the rim of the 
Wheel; while the "Centrum in Centri Trigono" is 
concealed within.

This Life Force is active in the One Substance, 
which becomes differentiated into the Four Elements as 
symbolized by the Four Cherubic Beasts at the Corners 
or the Card. Also this is the birth of Tetragrammaton, 
the Word of the Elements, coming into Existence, or 
Becoming, as shown by the Letters Yod, He, Vau, He on 
the Wheel. On this we also find the letters Taro or 
Rota and the suggestion of the Beginning of Law as 
Thora.

This Ray of Light is the Essence of Wisdom, the 
Higher Will or Purpose of the Universe, and as the Star 
Universe this becomes apparent in Chokmah, the Sphere 
of the Zodiac, the Second Sephira. It is the root of 
the Jupiter-Amoun Tradition of the Fatherhood of God as 
a Supreme and Concealed Force, which on that account 
was little comprehended by those who accepted the 
Tradition of a Mother and Son, with the Son preceding 
the Father.

This Ray is the Essence of Light, but it becomes 
represented in Chokmah as Grey, a mixture of colors 
which partially concealed the Supreme Essence, thus 
causing the Root of Duality. From this Path cometh the 
Tradition of the Light as the Word or Logos, who was in 
the Beginning with God and who was God.

The Path from Kether to Binah is attributed to the 
Trump called "The Universe" corresponding to Saturn, 
Kronus, or Time. This represents the early tradition of 
SUT, who later became identified with Set or Satan. 
Here we have the beginning of the Tradition of the 
Fatherless Child and the Mother, the Sut-Typhonian 
Mystery, as we shall see more clearly later on.

The Card shows a Female Figure as the Mother of 
All Things, but this conceals a figure of Dual-Sex, or 
the Idea of the Two-Sexed Son, which afterwards became 
the Twin Horus, and later the Two figures Sut-Horus, as 
Darkness and Light, and the Two Horizons. The Ellipse 
shows the beginning of the Time Cycle, for Saturn or 
Kronus was the Devourer of his Children, the Hours. It 
also indicates how the Gods, the Tellers of Time, were 
to be born from the Elementaries or Elements, under 
which form the earliest ideas of the gods existed. The 
Card indicates the essential natures of the Four 
Elements in the Undifferentiated Substance from which 
they proceeded; or in the Womb of Time. The Four Beasts 
at the corners again show this clearly, and the Card 
itself is called "The Great One of the Night of Time." 
In this Path "The Light shineth in Darkness but the 
Darkness comprehendeth it not," for the Children of 
Time know not the mystery of the Here and Now.

This Card is the synthesis of the Elemental 
Forces; the Figure in the center directs the Positive 
and Negative Currents. It is attributed to Saturn and 
symbolizes the Influence from the Crown which resulted 
in the formation of the Sphere of Saturn or the Sephira 
Binah, the Great Mother. The early tradition connected 
the idea of the Great Mother with Typhon the Mother of 
Sut.

Binah is the Sphere of the Substance of all 
things, and it balances that of Chokmah wherein is 
concentrated the Life Force. Together they represent 
Living-Substance, the Father-Mother from which all 
proceeds.

Binah is also called The Great Sea. All is said to 
have been produced from Water brooded over by Spirit.

Uniting Chokmah and Binah we find the Path 
attributed to "The Star" and the Sign Aquarius. This 
Sign is Ruled by Saturn, and it will be noticed that it 
is connected with that Sphere. But it also represents 
the mystery of the Star Universe, which symbolism is 
derived from Chokmah.

The old G.D. Ritual (although attributing this 
card to the wrong Path, as in the old order) states: 
"This Key represents a Star with seven principal and 
fourteen secondary rays, altogether twenty-one, the 
number of the Divine Name AHIH. (Notice AHIH is the 
Divine Name of Kether immediately above.) In the 
Egyptian sense it is Sirius, the Dog-Star, the Star of 
Isis-Sothis. Around it are the seven planets. The nude 
figure is the symbol of Isis, Nepthys, and Hathoor. She 
is Aima, Binah, and Tebunah, the Great Supernal Mother 
Aima Elohim pouring upon Earth the Waters of Creation. 
In this Key she is completely unveiled. The two urns 
contain the influence of Chokmah and Binah. On the 
Right springs the Tree of Life, on the Left the 
Knowledge of Good and Evil, whereon the bird of Hermes 
alights, therefore the Key represents the restored 
world."

This symbolism is so clear according to the 
Restored World Plan of the Paths that it would seem to 
need little comment. But there is much more that might 
be said. 

The earliest calculation of Time centered in the 
revolution of the Serpent round the Dog Star. The First 
Mother is said to have given birth to the Seven 
Elementaries, who became the Seven Gods or Planetary 
Intelligences, the tellers of Time. I may go into this 
aspect more fully later on.

I have purposely made no mention of the Path from 
Kether to Tiphereth, as this will be better understood 
if we first deal with those from Chokmah to Tiphereth, 
and from Binah to Tiphereth. 

According to the Tarot Keys these are "The Sun" 
and "The Devil"; the twins of Light and Darkness.

The Card of "The Sun" represents the Influence of 
Chokmah or the Star Universe upon Tiphereth. The old 
G.D. description may again be quoted, but how different 
it appears when the card is in its proper place. "The 
Sun has twelve principal rays which represent the 
Zodiac (Chokmah), these are divided into 36 Decanates, 
and again into seventy-two Quinaries. Thus the Sun 
itself embraces the whole Creation in its rays. The 
Seven Hebrew Yods falling through the Air refer to the 
Solar Influence descending. The Two Children, standing 
respectively upon Water and Earth, represent the 
Generating influence of both, brought into action by 
the Rays of the Sun. They are the two inferior and 
passive elements, as the Sun and Air above them are the 
superior and active elements of Fire and Air. 
Furthermore these two Children resemble the Sign of 
Gemini."

Now, if we place the "Key" in position on its 
proper Path, glancing for a moment at the complete 
diagram of the Paths, we shall be able to draw some 
further conclusions.

The Sun, as a Star from the Sphere of Chokmah, is 
seen descending to take up his Office in Tiphereth, as 
the Son of the Father. The symbolism of the Sun shows 
the corrected division of Time according to the 
Precession of the Equinoxes, viz.: the Osirian 
calculation of the 365 1/4 days in the Year, instead of 
365 according to the Sut-Typhonians whose calculations 
were made by the Dog-Star. Gerald Massey states "There 
is an Egyptian legend which relates how Osiris in the 
365th year of his reign came from Nubia accompanied by 
Horus to chase the Sut-Typhonians out of Egypt. By this 
we may understand that the perfect Solar Year of 365 
1/4 days was made to supersede the Sun and Sirius Year 
of 365 days. In the battle for supremacy Horus was 
aided by Taht, the Lord of the luni-solar reckonings."

The two Children, or Twins, represent the twin 
theories, and also the Horus Twins, and the Two 
Traditions, which resolve themselves in Tiphereth.

Also the Wall of Red with its Blue Top represents 
the Barrier and the Waters of Death. The Path 
attributed to the Key "Death" is that from Chesed to 
Geburah, and it crosses this Path of "The Sun." Again 
the Twins appear on the Path of Gemini, which runs from 
Tiphereth to Hod. 

Rider's Pack shows a different symbolism. The Sun 
and Wall appear as before, but the Twins are replaced 
by a Child on a White Horse. This is the Crowned Child, 
the Son of the Sun, who has overcome Death and is the 
ruler of this Aeon.

Chokmah is the Root of Fire and this Card is 
called "The Lord of the Fire of the World" showing the 
Sun as representative of the Star Universe while ruling 
the World or Malkuth the Tenth Sephira.

This is the Path of the Tradition of Light.

We may now examine the Path from Binah to 
Tiphereth which is represented by "The Devil" and the 
Sign of Capricorn which is ruled by Saturn from whose 
Sphere it springs.

This Key is called "The Lord of the Gates of 
Matter, the Child of the Forces of Time," and it 
represents the Birth of Matter from the Great Sea, or 
Mother, the One Substance. This is the Way of the 
Children of Time, Saturn or Kronus. It is the Path of 
the Tradition of Darkness, the twin-brother of Light, 
of Lucifer, the Satanic Saviour who Fell from Heaven. 
This gave birth to the idea of the Sun as the Devil or 
Satan, for it represents the Sun in his material 
aspect, the Red Disk of Atum.

The Key shows the Twins chained by Time, while 
those of the "Sun" Card are Free, since they receive 
the influence of the Divine Will from Chokmah. The 
Italian Pack clearly shows The Devil standing upon the 
Sun, and so does Levi. This is the Card of Ayin, the 
Eye. It represents the Eye doctrine rather than that of 
the Head or Heart. The Sut-Typhonian calculation of 
Time was incorrect in representing the Year by 365 
days.

Notice in this card there is also a Wall, but the 
color symbolism is reversed. This again indicates the 
Wall of "Death" whose path this one crosses in the same 
manner as that of the Sun on the opposite side of the 
Tree.

This Path of "The Devil" represents the Sut-
Typhonian tradition of Set or Satan, as its ruler was 
afterwards called. The Path of "The Sun" represents the 
tradition of the Jupiter-Ammonians with Horus as its 
ruler. Horus of the Star is the reconciler between 
them.

Both the traditions of Light and Darkness as 
opposed to each other sprang from the Primal Idea of 
the Pure Spiritual Light of The Ever Coming Son, IU, 
the Holy Child of Kether. So we may now examine the 
Path from Kether to Tiphereth, that of the Influence of 
the Supreme and Concealed Father of All becoming 
Manifested in the Son in whom Glory and Suffering are 
identical.

This, by Tarot, is the Card called "Judgment" 
attributed to the Letter Shin, the true Fire of the 
Spirit, and the progenitor of the Sun behind the Sun. 
This is the equilibrated Triple Flame of the Supreme 
Godhead, the Winged Globe of the Three Supernals, the 
Head of the Staff of the Universal Mercury, the 
Absolute Reason of All Things.

The Influence of this Path causes the Dead to rise 
from their tombs in the Resurrection of the pure Spirit 
and the Regeneration of Matter. It passes through the 
Path of "The Star" as the Child of Chokmah and Binah 
which overcomes Death. It is the Path of the Ever-
living One coming into Manifestation, it represents the 
Absolute and Universal Tradition of the Golden Age. "It 
is called the Card of Perpetual Intelligence because it 
_regulateth_ the motions of the Sun and Moon (Tiphereth 
and Yesod) in their proper Order, each in an orbit 
convenient to it" (Sepher Yetzirah).

The Paths of "The Sun" and "Devil" merely suggest 
man's attempts to discover the true Motions and Order 
of the Universe, and to translate them into Time. This 
Path _actually regulates these motions_, therefore 
suggests, perhaps, the true calculation of the Course 
of the whole Solar System round the invisible Center of 
All.

It is said in the Old G.D. Ritual: "This card is a 
glyph of the powers of fire. The Angel crowned with the 
Sun is Michael, the Ruler of the Solar Fire. The 
Serpents which leap in the Rainbow are symbols of the 
Fiery Seraphim. The Trumpet represents the influence of 
the Spirit descending upon Binah (this according to my 
opinion should be Tiphereth), the Banner and Cross 
refer to the rivers of Paradise."

But in this Card we are able to trace the 
symbolism of the Divine Breath of Kether, not 
whispering the Work in Chokmah, but coming to us 
through the Trumpet of the Sun, ever proclaiming the 
Brightness of the Lord and Giver of Life to all men.

And this Trumpet is the Horn that is exhalted for 
ever. The Path combines the Mysteries of the Death and 
Resurrection as shown in "The Sun"; and the Erection 
and Re-erection of "The Devil" with the Generation and 
Regeneration of the Spirit.

As shown in "Q. B. L.," Shin represents the Roots 
of the Elements, the essences of Kether, Chokmah and 
Binah, concentrated in Tiphereth. It also represents 
"Number," the first of the Three Creative Sepharim of 
the Sepher Yetzirah.

Having dealt with the most direct influences 
descending upon Tiphereth, and we must next consider 
the supporting Pillars and the indirect influences 
through Chesed and Geburah.

Let us take the Path from Chokmah to Chesed, and 
then follow the one from Chesed to Tiphereth, thus 
completing the Right side first.

The Key to the Influence between Chokmah and 
Chesed is called "Temperance" and is attributed to the 
Sign Sagittarius. A Figure is seen pouring fluid from 
one urn to another. It represents "Preservation," as 
opposed to the "Destruction" of the Path of the 
"Blasted Tower" on the opposite side, while the 
equilibrated Path in the Center is that of "Creation" 
and "Regeneration" as before noticed.

Sagittarius is the Sign symbolized by the Archer 
who is half man, half horse. The Horse is said to be 
the gift to man of the Goddess of Wisdom, viz.: 
Chokmah. This Sign is Ruled by Jupiter and it receives 
the Influence of the Path of IU-Pater through Chokmah. 
It is also connected directly with the Sphere of 
Jupiter or Chesed. This gives us some indication of the 
dual-symbolism of the Forces of Life in the two Urns 
held by the figure on the Card. We may also glimpse 
some idea of the Ascending and Descending Arrows of the 
AA or IU. Again we have the ascent and descent of the 
Wheel of Life or Zodiac which revolves, so to speak, as 
Chokmah, between the two Jupiterial influences.

The Figure is clothed in Red and Blue, for Chokmah 
is the "Root of Fire" and Chesed the "Sphere of Water." 
It stands on Water, or Chesed, but the Robe immediately 
above the Water is Red, for Sagittarius is a Fiery 
Sign.

In Rider's Pack we actually see a "Path and a Sun" 
to the left of the Figure, just where the Path of the 
Sun comes in this arrangement. The Sign of Fire is on 
the Breast of the Figure, above which is faintly seen 
the Hebrew IHVH, the Word of the Father, Chokmah.

Chesed is the Sephira of Mercy (opposed to that of 
Severity, Geburah) and also that of Authority for it 
Transmits or reflects the Word of the Father or Logos.

The Path from Chesed to Tiphereth is that of "The 
Moon" by Tarot and is attributed to the Sign of Pisces, 
which in turn is Ruled by Jupiter. Through this Path 
came the Piscean Tradition of the Fish-God, another 
aspect of Horus as the Solar Deity or Son.

The Card itself is described in the old G.D. 
Ritual as follows (we should place the card in position 
on the Tree and study the symbolism carefully):

"It represents the Moon in its increase in the 
side of Gedulah (Chesed), it has sixteen principal and 
sixteen secondary rays. Four Hebrew Yods fall from it 
(4 = Chesed the representative of the Law of the 
Father). There are two Watchtowers, Two Dogs and a 
Crayfish. The Four Yods represent the letters of the 
Holy Name (transmitted from the breast of the Figure of 
Temperance). The Crayfish is emblem of the Sun 
(Tiphereth) below the horizon, as he ever is when the 
Moon is increasing above."

As we shall see later the Path of the "Sun" is 
that of the Setting Sun. The Moon God was known as 
"Sin" whose word is restriction, and this has been 
characteristic of the Piscean Age just passed. The true 
tradition of the Sun became clouded in that age.

The Moon transmits some Light even if it is but a 
reflector of the Sun. The Word of Sin being 
Restriction, we may notice how the influence of 
"Preservation" became that of "Repression" which is but 
a partial understanding of the idea.

On the other hand, we should next study the Path 
from Binah to Geburah and then the one from Geburah to 
Tiphereth. These represent the opposite tradition of 
Over Indulgence, or "Destruction" through Waste of 
Life.

The Path from Binah, the Primal Mother, to Geburah 
the Sphere of Mars, is by Tarot "The Blasted Tower" and 
it is attributed to the Planet Mars. Here we see 
another aspect of Horus as the God of War and 
Vengeance.

The G.D. Ritual says: "It represents a Tower 
struck by a lightning flash proceeding from a rayed 
circle and terminating in a triangle. It is the Tower 
of Babel. The flash exactly forms the Astronomical 
Symbol of Mars. It is the power of the Triad 
(concentrated in Binah, 3) rushing down and destroying 
the Column of Darkness (the Pillar of Severity, also 
the Dark Tradition). The men falling from the Tower 
represent the fall of the Kings of Edom."

"On the Right Hand side of the Tower is Light and 
the representation of the Tree of Life by Ten Circles, 
on the Left Hand is Darkness, and eleven Circles 
symbolizing the Qliphoth."

Here the tradition of Light and Darkness is 
clearly indicated. The fall of the Tower of Babel 
resulted in the loss of the Universal Language, since 
when confusion has prevailed. The Sons of Darkness for 
a time retrogressed, while the followers of the 
Tradition of Light were advancing. This is the result 
of the Positive and Negative Currents from the "Path of 
Saturn" through Binah the Dark Sphere.

The influence of Mars, passing through Geburah, 
the Sphere of Mars and of Severity, is transmitted to 
Tiphereth by the Path of Aries, or "The Emperor." Aries 
is Ruled by Mars and is the House of the Exaltation of 
the Sun. The Ram or Lamb was sacrificed as a 
_substitute_ for Man, so this path represents 
"Substitution" as that of Pisces, on the opposite side, 
represents "Reflection." Both are partial truths. This 
Path also transmits the "Personal Will" of Geburah to 
Tiphereth. When the Personal Will is substituted for 
the Divine or True Will trouble arises. In Tiphereth, 
The Heart, both the Personal and True Wills are 
harmonized, or apparently so.

Aries and Pisces are seen with the Sun, or 
Tiphereth, as reconciler between them, as in the 
beginning of the Great Cycle, with the Sun in His 
Natural place, unaffected by the Precession of the 
Equinoxes. In this position the Jupiter-Ammonian, and 
the Sut-Typhonian controversy is temporarily 
harmonized.

The Reciprocal Path from Chesed, Mercy, to 
Geburah, Severity, is that of "Death" the Great 
Transformer. The Sign Scorpio is its Yetziratic 
attribution, and this is Ruled by Mars the Destroyer. 
Death is both the enemy and the friend in one, for in 
truth there is no "death," but only a "Change of Life." 
The Card shows a Skeleton with a scythe, he is cutting 
down heads (one of which is crowned) but the "rise 
again" as soon as he passes over them, for the 
Influences of the Paths of "Resurrection," 
"Regeneration," and "Re-erection" all play upon this 
one. The Path of Shin, equilibrating Light and 
Darkness, rules over all, for this Path is that of the 
Influence of IU the Ever-coming Son, the true Horus 
whose appearance in Aries is as the Lamb, in Pisces as 
the Fish, or in the earlier Signs as The Lion, The 
Beetle, The Twins, or the Bull.

We have seen how the Influence of the Tradition of 
Light flows down into Tiphereth through two channels. 
The Paths of IU-Pater, Chokmah, and The Sun, and those 
of IU-Pater, Chokmah, Sagittarius, Chesed, and Pisces.

We have likewise traced the Tradition of Darkness 
through the Paths of Saturn, Binah and Capricorn, to 
Tiphereth; and also through Saturn, Binah, Mars, 
Geburah, and Aries, to the same Sphere.

The Universal Tradition which transcends both the 
Light and the Darkness, descends from Kether-Pure 
Being, by the Path of Shin or Spirit, through the Path 
of Aquarius, The Star of Hope, and that of Scorpio, 
Death and Despair, directly upon Tiphereth. This is the 
Line of Equilibrium between the Balanced Ideas of Good 
and Evil; Light and Darkness; Preservation and 
Destruction, etc. This is the Path of the Doctrine of 
the Heart, which unites with those of the Eye and the 
Head (Ayin and Resh) in Tiphereth the Sphere of the 
Heart, or the Son, wherein all things are Beautified 
and Harmonized.

It should be noticed that the Direct Influence of 
the Supernals upon Tiphereth comes from the Paths of 
Resh and Ayin uniting with those of Shin and Tzaddi. 
The Numerical Value of these Letters added to Tiphereth 
is 200 + 70 + 300 + 90 + 6 = 666, the Grand Scale 
Number of The Sun, and of the Beast or Man. Again, the 
Descending Triad of the Sephiroth Binah, Chokmah, 
Tiphereth is 326 [i.e. by concatenating the numbers of 
those Sephiroth. -- B.R.] the Numeration of IHShVH the 
Redeemer, the formula of the Descent of Shin into IHVH 
or of Spirit into Matter. 326 is also the Numeration of 
PARChVAL in the oldest form, which became PARZIVAL who 
is 418 in the New Aeon; thus connecting him with 
ABRAHADABRA, the Word of the Aeon, and the Reward of 
Ra-Hoor-Khuit; as will be more fully discussed later 
on. For the moment we should notice that The Beast, The 
Word of the Aeon, and Parzival are Harmonized in 
Tiphereth, as are all aspects of the Sun and the Son, 
although there may appear to be "division hither 
homeward."

The Sephiroth and Paths so far taken into 
consideration, form the great Heavenly Hexagram, the 
Center of which is Spirit, although this central point 
is not indicated by any Sephira, but only by the Path 
of Shin. In the Tarot Key "The Judgment" this Invisible 
Breath of Spirit proceeds from the Mouth of the Trumpet 
in the Center of the Card.

If we examine this Hexagram, we notice that the 
Hebrew Letters on the Paths forming the Hexagon, are as 
follows: Kaph, Samek, Qoph, He, Pe, Tau: or 
20+60+100+5+80+400 = 665 which is the number of BITh 
HRChM, meaning The Womb. This does represent The Womb 
of Creation, for these paths outline the Circle of the 
"Key of Life" or Ankh, upon which the Tree of Life is 
built.

We should notice also the peculiar arrangement of 
the Hexagram. There are four interior Paths, forming 
the bases of four similar Triangles. These Paths are 
those of "The Star," "The Sun," "Death" and "The 
Devil". They may be said to symbolically represent the 
Sun in the Four Quarters. Thus, "The Devil," although 
the basis of the Tradition of Darkness, represents the 
Rising Sun of the Eastern Horizon; for SUT is the 
"Opener" of the Day. This Dark Tradition gradually 
resulted in a Lurid Dawn. The Path of "The Sun" 
represents the Setting Sun, since the tradition of 
Light tended to become "Twilight." This is the Path of 
Horus, Lord of the Western Horizon, who closed the Day. 
Together they are Sut-Horus the Twin Lion Gods. The 
Path of "The Star" represents the Sun of Midday, at its 
height; thus "The One Star in Sight" during the Day. 
This position of the Sun has been called AHAThOOR, and 
in the Tarot Card we see that Goddess. But AHA is also 
a title of Horus, as is HAR and HAR-MAKHU, which means 
Horus of the Star. This is his Name as Opener of the 
Year, and it is His Influence which descends through 
the Path of Shin, as the Sun behind the Sun.

The Path of "Death" represents the Sun of 
Midnight, in the Underworld.

There came a period in Egyptian tradition when 
Four Suts were recognized as those of the Four 
Quarters, these were then called the Children of Tum, 
the Setting Sun, who became Atum, and afterwards Atum-
Ra, the Solar Deity as Father of All Things. This was 
the period when the Supreme and Concealed Father had 
been entirely lost to the followers of the Tradition of 
Light, while the Doctrine of the Mother and Child as 
First Cause had fallen into disrepute as representing 
the Tradition of Darkness. The Influence of the Supreme 
still descended upon Tiphereth, the Sun, through IU, 
but was only recognized by the few followers of the 
Universal Tradition of the Golden Age. All these 
traditions became merged in Tiphereth and there 
Harmonized, though the result was not an absolutely 
true one. An attempt to establish the truth was made by 
Amenhatep IV, or King Khu-en-Aten, who revived Aten 
Worship in place of that of Atum Ra, or Amen Ra; but he 
was ahead of his time, and it remained for the Present 
Aeon to re-establish the truth, as we shall endeavour 
to show more clearly further on.

We may remark, however, that the Universal Mercury 
is said to be "All present in Heaven and in Hell" so 
that we find the Ideas of Lucifer or Satan as the Sun, 
blended with those of the Sun of Light, and the Sun of 
the Universe, in the Heart of Man. Also we may notice 
how the Higher Will comes down to Tiphereth from 
Chokmah, and the lower or personal will through 
Geburah. These are both blended in Tiphereth, the 
Heart.

The "Circle" of the "Key of Life" having been 
formed; now follows the "Cross" which completes the 
Ankh. But at this point we shall notice a "Passover" or 
Crossing over of the dual Currents, for the "Middle 
Pillar" is the Caduceus, and the twin-serpents, while 
knotted together in Tiphereth, cross and re-unite lower 
down. This is symbolized clearly by the Three Mother 
Letters of the Elements, or the Three Sepharim of 
Number, Writing, and Speech; as explained in Q. B. L.  
These are Shin above Mem, above Aleph. We have already 
dealt with Shin as IU, which it symbolizes perfectly, 
since if we place the "I" inside the "U," the letter 
Shin is formed.  These are the letters of the Father 
and Son, who are united in Tiphereth.

Let us now trace the Currents as they "cross-
over". The Influence from the Path of Aries, joining 
Geburah and Tiphereth, passes through the latter and 
emerges as a channel from Tiphereth to Netzach. This in 
the Tarot is the Key called "Strength" and it is 
attributed to the Sign Leo which is Ruled by the Sun.

The Card shows a Woman closing (or opening) the 
mouth of a Lion. This is clearly the Woman of Venus, or 
Netzach, united with the Lion of the Sun or Tiphereth. 
The Ram, or Lamb (another form of Horus) has been 
sacrificed as a substitute, and passes through the 
Solar Fire at the "Passover." In the City of the Sun it 
may truly be said that "The Lion lies down with the 
Lamb"; both are aspects of Horus, their paths are seen 
united in Tiphereth.

This Lion may be called "The Green Lion" where the 
Path meets Netzach (Emerald Green), and "The Red Lion" 
as he approaches the Sun. Again we find symbolism of 
the Twin Lions of Horus (as later they appear as the 
twin Sphinxes of the Charioteer). We see the "Strength" 
of Geburah, transmitted through the Ram and the Sun, to 
this Path, where its Animal Nature becomes subdued by 
the Pure Love of the Woman of Netzach. Thus the Dark 
tradition becomes purified through this process.

On the other hand, the Path from Chesed to 
Tiphereth ("The Moon" by Tarot, or Sign of Pisces) 
emerges from its Solar Bath, as the Path of "The 
Lovers" or Gemini, which unites Tiphereth with Hod. 
Gemini is Ruled by Mercury whose sphere is Hod. We may 
then trace the "Wisdom" from Chokmah, through paths of 
Light, as it flows into this reservoir of pure Reason, 
carrying with it the ideas of the "Pairs of Opposites" 
from "Temperance", "The Moon" (with its twin towers), 
and "The Lovers" or Gemini.

This Key, "The Lovers", depicts the Symbolism 
perfectly. The Card shows the Sun above the heads of 
the Figures, just as they are relatively to Tiphereth. 
Beneath it are the Twins, the same Children we saw in 
the path of "The Sun" transmitting the Tradition from 
Chokmah. They have overcome the illusion of  the "Moon" 
with its restrictions. Cupid is seen with his Bow and 
Arrow (perhaps the Bow of the Moon and the Arrow of 
Sagittarius). Sometimes this card is shown as 
symbolizing a Man between two Women representing Virtue 
and Vice (so-called). He must learn to treat them both 
alike, and harmonize these ideas in the Light of 
Tiphereth, the Heart. This was a very necessary lesson 
for the followers of the White Tradition to learn, for 
the twilight had made their view narrow and restricted, 
therefore an elements of Sin (the Moon God) had 
entered, and the earlier Wisdom had been lost.

We may now consider the Influence of the Side 
Pillars. On the one hand we find "Justice" or Libra 
which is Ruled by Venus, bringing down the Mercy of 
Chesed to Netzach the Sphere of Venus. Here we see the 
Law of Love coming into operation under the Will of 
Chokmah, as it is written, "Love is the law, love under 
will". Love needs to be Balanced in Netzach, thus 
avoiding extremes. Opposite to this Path is that which 
transmits the Strength of Geburah to the Sphere of 
Mercury or Hod. The Influence herein operative is that 
of "The Hermit" or Virgo, which is Ruled by Mercury. 
One must be reasonable in regard to one's Virginity, 
but the Power of the Virgin is great.

Herein we find the Dark Tradition transformed into 
a wise Reserve or Secrecy. The Hermit merely conceals 
the Light in his Cloak, while he carries his Staff in 
his hand. This represents a better adjustment of the 
Life, which is the Substance of Light; the excess of 
the Path of the "Tower" is tempered down to a wise 
control. This refers also to the Control of Speech; the 
Tower was that of Babel, and its destruction caused the 
confusion of tongues, while here we see a re-adjustment 
as this path enters the Domain of Mercury, which 
contains the influence from Chokmah, the "Word" lost to 
the Dark Brothers for a time.

Few realize the secrets of the Tradition of the 
Widow's son, and the Substitute, and the Lost Word, as 
depicted in this Left Hand side of the Tree.

Uniting the Sephiroth Netzach and Hod is the Path 
of "The Hierophant", the Initiator into the Mysteries 
of Osiris the Bull. This Path is attributed to the Sign 
Taurus which is Ruled by Venus or Netzach. Venus and 
Mercury are herein united in a Wise and Initiated Love 
of a reciprocal nature. We see two Figures in this 
card, presided over by the Hierophant who is blessing 
them in the Sign of the Trinity.

There is yet another Path from Tiphereth to Yesod 
which crosses this one and influences it. This is the 
Path of "The Hanged Man" attributed to the Letter Mem, 
and the Element Water. It refers to "Writing" as the 
second Sepharim, and by means of Written Tradition have 
the true mysteries been transmitted, even thought the 
"writer" may never have been recognized or known to 
men.

Here we see a figure of a Man suspended by one 
foot from a gallows, his head and arms forming a 
triangle, above which his legs form a cross. He is the 
Sun of the Sun, bringing down the Light as far as 
Yesod, the Subconscious Mind of Humanity. His body is 
reversed, as if reflected in the Waters, his Head is 
surrounded by Glory, the reflection of Tiphereth and 
Kether. His Head is thus in Yesod, the Sphere of the 
Moon which reflects the Sun upon the Earth, or Malkuth. 
The shape of the Figure in Rider's Pack perfectly 
symbolizes this position on the Tree.

His is the power of the Redeeming Love, usually 
considered as self-sacrifice, but more truly 
representing the Justified One, who says: "This is my 
body which I destroy, in order that it may be renewed." 
The Mysteries of the Rose Cross are transmitted through 
this Channel, the Initiation being attended to by "The 
Hierophant". Two other Paths exert their influence 
directly on Yesod, the Foundation, or Sphere of the 
Moon; one leading from Netzach, and the other from Hod. 
The Coils of the Twin Serpents fold back again here, 
the Current having absorbed the influences of the Paths 
of the Side Pillars through these two Sephiroth.

The Path from Netzach to Yesod continues the 
Influence from the Path of Leo united with that of 
Libra. By Tarot it is "The Chariot" which is attributed 
to the Sign Cancer, ruled by the Moon (Yesod). This is 
a very important card indeed. The Hebrew letter 
attributed to it is "Cheth" which is 418 the number of 
the Word of the Aeon ABRAHADABRA. The Charioteer is one 
aspect of the Lord of the Aeon, and he is in a certain 
sense the Initiator, for in this age the Influence of 
the Constellation of Taurus comes to use through the 
Sign Cancer according to the Precessional. He has 
harnessed the Black and White Sphinxes, the Traditions 
of Darkness and Light, and he uses them to draw his 
Chariot. He is under the Starry Canopy of Love. He is 
the Child of the Powers of the Waters, for he has 
descended by devious channels from the Great Sea; he is 
also the Lord of the Triumph of Light in its higher 
sense. He has the Strength of the "Lion" and the 
balance of "Justice" combined with the Power of Love.

Dual Moons are shown on his shoulders, for, as 
Cancer, he is closely connected with The Moon. The 
Lingam-Yoni and Winged Globe appear on his cubical 
Chariot which represents "The Foundation" or Yesod.

Opposite to him on the Tree is the Path from Hod 
to Yesod, that of "The High Priestess" or "Priestess of 
the Silver Star". This is attributed to "The Moon" with 
which Sphere it unites. This is the Channel of the 
Serpent of Light winding back from Hod and bringing 
with it the Influence of the Paths of Gemini and Virgo. 
The High Priestess knows the secret powers of the 
"Lovers" and of the "Virgin". These she has under 
control in the same sense that the Charioteer controls 
the Sphinxes. She is truly his Counterpart. On her Lap 
is The book of the Law, the lost Thora of the Wheel of 
the Tarot, transmitted so wonderfully from the Path of 
IU-Pater through Chokmah, "The Sun", Tiphereth, "The 
Lovers", and Hod. Note that the Descent of this Law 
upon Tiphereth through Chokmah, was by the Paths of 
Kaph (20) and Resh (200) and that Liber CCXX is the 
Book of the Law; also that from Tiphereth, which is 6; 
representative of the Father 10 and the Mother 5 (as 
Wisdom and Understanding or IH) which make 15 and again 
through addition 6; it passed into the path of Zain 
(The Sword) 7 and to Hod 8, thus 15 = 6 and through 
Gimel 3 (6 + 3 = 9) to Yesod 9, where it entered the 
Subconscious Mind of Humanity as a seed of the Aeon.

The "Priestess of the Silver Star" is the Pure 
Influence of the Higher Self on the Subconscious Mind, 
transmitting the secret of the Star Universe and of the 
Silver Star. She is the Initiator into the Mysteries of 
Nuit, as "The Charioteer" indicates those of Hadit.

Our work, so far, has led us to an understanding 
of how the Universal Tradition has been imbedded in the 
Subconscious Mind of Humanity; built into its very 
Foundation and Substance. It is our Great and Glorious 
Heritage from the Past, made up from the Universal 
experience of the Race. But all men are not yet aware 
of this. It is still "Unconscious" in most.

Now we come to the final stages of our Journey, 
wherein these ideas are Manifested on the Material 
Plane. Malkuth, The Kingdom, is the Sphere of the 
Elements, and is saturated with the subtle influences, 
whereby the Fallen Daughter may become the Mother and 
bring forth Man as the Crowned Child of the Aeon.

The Path from Hod to Malkuth is by Tarot "The 
Magician" attributed to Mercury. This is the Wisdom and 
Will of the Father in Heaven brought down to the 
Kingdom of Earth. (Have we not prayed "Thy Will be done 
on Earth as it is done in Heaven" and has it not been 
answered "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the 
Law"). The Magician controls the Elements by means of 
his Four Elementary Weapons under the Direction of the 
Higher Will, as shown in the Card by the Wand, the Cup, 
the Sword, and the Pantacle. His is the Path of the 
Magic of Light and of Occultism. He is then the 
representative of the Great Father upon Earth, and his 
influence is within every father who realizes that he 
is a star.

The Path from Netzach to Malkuth is that of the 
"Empress" and of Venus. She represents the Love which 
regenerates the Kingdom when properly understood. The 
key shows her crowned with the Diadem of Stars. She 
Transmits the Understanding of the Great Mother. (So 
long misunderstood and thought of as the unmated and 
despised Woman of the Dark Sphere). Hers is the Path of 
Mysticism and Devotion, and of those who would be 
absorbed in the Absolute. She Represents the Great 
Mother upon Earth and is the Influence within every 
mother who knows Herself to be a Star.

Thus is this Kingdom supplied with Wisdom and 
Love, and lastly with Power, for we must finally 
consider the Path from Yesod to Malkuth, that of the 
"Pure Fool", and the All-Wandering Air, the Reconciler 
in all things. This is the Path of the Crowned Child of 
the Spirit who is in the Heart of all Humanity when he 
is brought to birth upon the Earth. This is the Path of 
those who follow neither the way of Magick nor of 
Mysticism, but the "Way of the Tao". These are the 
Masters of both Will and Love for they UNCONSCIOUSLY do 
the Work of the Father. Just as a Child naturally rules 
over his parents and is able to obtain his slightest 
desire, without effort, so must all Serve the Crowned 
Child the Lord of the Aeon.

This Path transmits the Universal Tradition of the 
Central Pillar -- the Pillar of Mildness and Peace. 
This is the Pathway of the Light to be discovered amid 
the contending forces and the darkness of matter. This 
Path of the Holy Spirit of the Sun behind the Sun is 
that of the Letter Aleph. In it the two A's of the 
Beginning have become One. It is the Path of Air, the 
third Sepharim, or of Speech. But this is the Power of 
Speech in the Silence, of Harpocrates hidden within 
Horus. It is also the true Power, as it is written;





	Unity uttermost showed,

		I adore the Might of Thy Breath,

	Supreme and Terrible God

		Who makest the Gods and Death

	To tremble before Thee,

		I, I adore Thee.

This is the Path of IU, Horus-Harpocrates, the 
Ever Coming One, and of Har-Machis, Horus of the Star, 
the Opener of the Ways of Eternity. This is the Path of 
the Here and Now, transcending those of Time and Space. 
This is the Path of Truth, which Is Now, as It Was in 
the Beginning, and Ever Shall Be, Malkuth without End. 
Aumn.



Chapter IV

The Sun, The Devil, and the Redeemer

One of my aims in the foregoing chapter has been 
to show that this is the Aeon of the Foundation of the 
Kingdom upon Earth, characterized by the Incarnation of 
God in the Heart of every Man, Woman, and Child.

It is not so much a question of "Climbing the Tree 
of Life" as of recognizing how all things have been 
working together for good so that the Source of All 
might become manifest in Matter, here on Earth, and the 
Kingdom of Ra-Hoor-Khuit be established.

We have seen in tracing out the Traditions that 
there have been two Wills at work, the Divine and the 
Personal, and that through the Ages these have appeared 
in conflict. One is the Bright Star or Pentagram of 
Unconquered Will, the other the Dark Star of the 
Reversed Pentagram. These two Starts are symbolized by 
the hands of Man, or the Magician, one raised to Heaven 
in the Sign of Solve, the other directed downwards in 
the Sign of Coagula. When united they form a Ten-fold 
Star, just as the hand of the man who has fallen may be 
grasped by the one who Raises him in the Grip of the 
Lion, which exactly symbolizes this uniting of the 
Rising and Setting Sun, or the Twins Sut-Har. For the 
Two Wills are Harmonized in Tiphereth.

But when we consider Malkuth, it is a question of 
Raising the Fallen Daughter, the Animal Soul, or 
Matter, to the Throne of the Mother, Understanding. 
That is a more difficult task, but we now have the Keys 
in our hands.

The Union of the two Stars as a Tenfold-Star in 
Malkuth is the Work before us, for this represents the 
Covenant God made with Abraham, as promised by the 
Rainbow of the old order. Having apparently lost this 
Symbol of the Rainbow through the alteration of the 
Paths, we may hope to find instead the Fulfillment of 
the Promise of the Covenant.

In the old order of the Paths we found Q, Sh, Th 
as the three influences descending upon Malkuth. QShTh 
is the Hebrew word for the Rainbow of Promise.

The Authority on the Qabalah, referred to in our 
Preface, rejected the reformulation of the paths of the 
Tree, partly on account of the fact of this symbolism 
being lost in the new arrangement. But what have we in 
its place? Wisdom, Love, and Power directly descending 
upon the Earth; the Paths of Magick and Mysticism, 
united by the "Way of the Tao". More than this, we have 
the direct influence of the Three Supernals upon the 
Kingdom. Kether, the Crown of Light, is upon the Head 
of the Crowned Child of the Path of Aleph, who wields 
the true Power of the Breath; the Wisdom of Chokmah is 
seen in the Path of Beth or Mercury, the Great Magician 
who represents the Father on Earth; while the Great 
Mother, Binah the Third Sephira, is translated into the 
Path of the Empress, the Woman of Venus, on the Path of 
the Mystic. So we find Father, Mother and Holy Spirit 
or Son, all prepared to raise the Fallen Daughter. Yod, 
He, and Vau once more symbolically united with the 
final He. Thus the Missing members of the Body of 
Osiris are all brought together again; the Lost Word is 
recovered; the Rulers of the Four Elements of Malkuth 
are shown in their respective offices; and in the midst 
is the concealed Power of the Spirit of Shin, IU, or 
Io, which is 10, the number of Malkuth, as well as 
Kether.

The same Authority objected the some of the 
Alchemical Symbolism was destroyed. The Alchemists tell 
us that in order to make Gold, we must have Gold; and 
this the Gold of the Sun. What now makes Gold in our 
Revised arrangement? The influences descending upon 
Tiphereth, the Sun. We have shown how the principal 
Paths of Influence, which are all Solar in nature, give 
us 666 the Grand Number of the Sun in Tiphereth. The 
secondary influences are from Aries of the Golden 
Fleece, Scorpio the Path of "Death", or the Sun at the 
Dark Stage, and from Pisces which is by Tarot the 
"Moon". These together make the True Gold of the Sun. 
Again they tell us that the First Matter is the Soul of 
Man, and we have shown how the dual soul became divided 
as Adam and Eve, etc., so that you may work out this 
Alchemical Symbolism on other planes. But there is an 
even more important aspect, which this study may lead 
us to understand; the Inner Mystery of the Sun, the 
Heart of the Beast 666 which is Man. Herein we may 
discover the answer to the riddle of the Sphinx, who 
with fixed gaze of impenetrable Mystery looks on at all 
the Changes of Life. Here, too, we may learn something 
of the Concealed Mystery of the Strange Baphomet of the 
ancient Templars, for all is made clear in the Reformed 
Order. If this is the Age of Horus the Revealer and 
Opener, there is nothing hid that shall not be 
revealed.

Let us turn our attention for a little while to 
what, to some, may appear the absurd idea of The Devil. 
Eliphas Levi, wisely states: He who affirms the devil, 
creates or makes the devil. But it has elsewhere been 
written: Since every idea, theory or doctrine must, in 
the very nature of things, have some truth as its 
basis, it happens that the more difficult, 
unreasonable, or even absurd, any idea seems to be, the 
more illuminative does it become when thoroughly 
understood; for only some very important truth could 
have availed to give currency to a teaching of extreme 
incredibleness and difficulty. 

Thus it is with doctrine of the devil, which, in 
one form or another, is found in almost every religion 
of the world.

The chief snare of the Devil is the Illusion of 
Time. Man is limited by the ideas of Time and Space, 
which are but modes of the human mind, as is now 
becoming scientifically recognized. The Black Tradition 
is based on Time. Saturn, the God of Time, and the 
Progenitor of the Devil, or Serpent of Time, is shown 
on the Path leading from Kether to Binah. This 
influence is further transmitted from Binah to 
Tiphereth by the Path of "The Devil" as explained 
before. The Hebrew letters of these Paths are Tau and 
Ayin, whose numerical value is 400 and 70. Ayin, Tau, 
or OTh is the Hebrew word for Time, or a period of 
Time, 470 is also the numeration of other Hebrew words 
meaning Eternity, or literally, a cycle of cycles. This 
should be sufficient evidence that the Paths are 
rightly placed. Taking into account the other two Paths 
influencing Tiphereth on this side of the Tree, which 
are Pe and He, or 80 and 5; we obtain 400 + 70 + 80 + 5 
= 555 which is the Numeration of the Hebrew word for 
Obscurity. This certainly proves that the Dark 
Tradition is operative in this part of the Tree, and it 
accounts for much of the confusion of the "Tower" of 
Babel.

We have shown how the Sut-Typhonian tradition 
arose, so that the Son was thought to have preceded the 
Father, and the Mother to have been the First Cause by 
means of Blood. One should note in passing, that the 
Reciprocal Path of "The Star" is that of Aquarius which 
Sign governs the Blood Stream.

This tradition as far as Time is concerned led to 
the calculation of the Year as 365 Days, based on the 
Sun and Sirius Cycle. We may also notice that the 
Sephiroth Numbered 3, 6, and 5, are those whose 
influence is here depicted. They form a Triad, linked 
by the paths we have been discussing, and the base of 
this Triad is the path of "The Devil", and of the 
Rising Sun.

We shall have more to say in regard to the Devil, 
but for the moment let us turn to the other side of the 
Tree, and examine the Channels of the Light Tradition. 
We might have done well to call these the Traditions of 
Black and White, for Black is that which absorbs all 
colors, and White that which reflects them all. The 
True Light is Equilibrated and Concealed in that 
Darkness which is higher than eyesight.

The Force of the Primum Mobile of Kether produced 
the Whirling motions of the "Wheel of Life" resulting 
in the Star Universe and Sphere of the Zodiac. Thus 
originated the illusion of Space, the other great 
limitation of the mind of man.

This Space became narrowed down till the idea of a 
Straight and Narrow Way limited all the conceptions of 
the followers of these Paths. The Light became but a 
Twilight, and a reflection of the primal Truth, as 
indicated by the Path of Pisces, and the Tarot Key "The 
Moon". The Primal idea of the Supreme as the Concealed 
Life of All was soon lost. Infinite Space, filled with 
the Infinite but Invisible Life, became 3rd dimensional 
space in the minds of men. The Paths of Influence are 
of interest; Kaph 20, and Resh 200, give us 220, the 
numeration of the Book of the Law of Thelema (Will), 
which will eventually redeem this narrowed conception 
and bring back the Truth. Will is Chokmah the Sphere of 
Wisdom and of the Word or Logos, which was not 
comprehended by the Children of Darkness. This being 
the 2nd Sephira, makes the complete Channel from Kether 
to Tiphereth 222, which is the Hebrew numeration of the 
word for "Whiteness", thus proving our earlier 
speculations Qabalistically.

Taking the Sephirotic Triad as before, we find the 
Base is the Path of "The Sun". This in the Twilight of 
the Setting Sun of the White tradition, they mistook 
for the Lost Father of the Gods. The Sun is, of course, 
the center of the Solar System and Ruler of the 
Planets; He is truly the Father of this Earth, but He 
is NOT THE FATHER OF THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. That is where 
the followers of the White Tradition made an even 
greater mistake than those of the Black. 

The Sephiroth Tiphereth, Chokmah and Chesed, as 6, 
2, 4 or 624 give us a number equivalent to the Hebrew 
Word for "His Covenant". The Arrow of Sagittarius 
(which in the old arrangement of the Paths was said to 
be the Arrow that pierced the Rainbow, on account of 
its position below Tiphereth) is seen on one of the 
other Paths of influence connecting this triad, and  
the "Moon" or "Bow" on the other. If we take these 
Sephiroth in the order of 264 we get the numeration of 
Hebrew Words for "Footprints" literally "Foot's 
Breadth", and "A Straight Row" indicating the "Narrow" 
Way referred to before. Or as 246, we obtain "Vision" 
or "Aspect" denoting Space, as before indicated. This 
also seems good enough Qabalistic proof.

We may now better understand how the True Sun of a 
Bi-une Nature, became looked upon as Sut-Har, and how 
the Traditions of the Sut-Typhonians and those of the 
Jupiter-Ammonians, were blended in Tiphereth. 

The Influence of Har-Machis, Horus of the Star, 
was little understood owing to the limitations of Time 
and Space, though it descended as the Mediating 
Influence upon Tiphereth, and Welded the Twin 
conflicting Ideas together. The Osirians of the Right 
Hand Path, examining Space with great care, discovered 
the more correct calculation of the Year as 365 1/4 
days. The Four Quarters were established, the Four Suts 
arose, and these were accepted as the Children of the 
Father Atum-Ra. Ra became the great Sun God, and the IU 
was lost to view in such an apparently Harmonious 
arrangement. So he who was the Son, became looked upon 
as The Father, and the Supernal Triad was no longer 
taken into consideration. The Pillars of the Temple of 
the Sun were set up. Boaz and Jachin were established 
in strength, as Geburah and Chesed, Severity and Mercy, 
and the Sun was seen between them as the Sole Lord of 
Light.

Followers of the old Sut-Typhonian Tradition might 
still secretly Symbolize Him as The Devil; followers of 
the Osirian Cult, as The Sun of Heaven.

Let us now return to our discussion of the Devil, 
or Baphomet fairly depicted, but the Symbolism of 
Rider's Pack is wrong. Eliphas Levi drew him correctly, 
and also described him perfectly. Let me quote: "The 
name of the Templar Baphomet, which should be spelt 
Qabalistically backwards, is composed of three 
abbreviations: Tem., Ohp., Ab., "Templi ominium hominum 
pacis abbas", "the father of the temple of universal 
peace among men." According to some, the Baphomet was a 
monstrous head; (Resh, the head, is the Sun); according 
to others, a demon in the form of a goat. (Capricorn is 
the Goat). A sculptured coffer was disinterred recently 
in the ruins of an old commandery of the temple, and 
antiquaries observed upon it a baphometic figure, 
corresponding in its attributes to the Goat of Mendes 
(Osiris) and the androgyne (two-sexed Horus) of 
Khunrath. It was a bearded figure with a female body, 
holding the sun in one hand and the moon in the other, 
attached to chains. Now this virile head is a beautiful 
allegory which attributes to thought alone the 
initiating and creating principle. Here the head 
represents spirit and the body matter. The orbs 
enchained to the human form, and directed by that 
nature of which intelligence is the head, are also 
magnificently allegorical. The sign, all the same, was 
discovered to be obscene and diabolical by the learned 
men who examined it. Can we be surprised after this at 
the spread of medieval superstition in our own day! One 
thing only surprises me, that, believing in the devil 
and his agents, men do not re-kindle the faggots."

The was written by Levi in 1855; even today there 
are many people who refuse to see the light of truth; 
but we are progressing.

The Figure of Baphomet, or the XVth Key of the 
Tarot, depicts the Symbolism of Tiphereth perfectly, 
from the point of view of the combined Traditions of 
Sut-Har, as shown on the Revised Tree.

The Flaming Torch between the Horns is the Holy 
Spirit of the Path of Shin, his Horns are the Paths of 
Sut-Har or of Capricorn and the Sun. The female body 
shows the Tradition of the Mother, while the Legs of 
the Goat are crossed to indicate the Passover or 
Crossing of the Ways after this point, as explained 
before. His head is that of an Ass, showing that the 
followers of the "Head" Doctrine of the acceptance of 
the Sun as the Supreme Father were foolish, but that in 
Tiphereth, the Heart, all things might be Harmonized. 
He makes the sign of Solve and Coagula, thus indicating 
"That which is above is like unto that which is below, 
and that which is below is like unto that which is 
above, for the performance of the Miracle of the One 
Substance". This is the sole Hermetic Dogma of the 
Microcosm and the Macrocosm; their Equivalence is found 
in Tiphereth. This sign also indicates the two Currents 
of "Will" and "will", harmonized in the Heart. This 
Figure should be studied with care, and it will reveal 
many other truths. The Caduceus in his lap, for 
instance, clearly shows that the Central Pillar of the 
Tree of Life is the Staff whereon the Twin Serpents of 
Time and Space are Twined.

We have explained how the Sut-Typhonians first 
looked upon the Great Mother as of Animal Nature, 
afterwards assuming her into the Heaven as the Star 
Goddess, Mother of the Sun. In this latter assumption 
they were absolutely correct, but the Worship of Nuit 
is practically pre-Dynastic, as is Her Symbol the 
Crossed Arrows. In the Darkness the idea arose of half-
human, half-animal beings as representing the earliest 
types. The Hebrew Tradition of the First Adam 
corresponds to this. The Universal Tradition of the 
Sons of God on Earth, was lost. Man, today, is the 
highest of the Animals, but the lowest of the Spiritual 
Beings. It is the personal will and power of choice, 
which makes him more than animal, for he has within him 
a spark of the Divine Intelligence which makes it 
possible for him to direct his own actions, though 
until he discovers the Divine Will in the darkness of 
his own being, and aligns the personal will with It, he 
cannot progress. The personal will transmitted to the 
Heart of man from the Sphere of Geburah, is harmonized 
with the Divine Will of Chokmah, to the extent to which 
the Channels of Light are Open. But Har, the Sun of the 
White Tradition, was "Closer" and the True Will was 
little realized and understood.

We can now see that Tiphereth is a perfect Image 
of The Beast, 666, as Man. This aspect combines in 
itself all that is Animal with all that is Human and 
all that is Spiritual and God-Like. This is the Great 
Solar Image which all men have worshipped and all men 
will worship for a long time to come. Yet it is not the 
Highest Truth in itself, it is a Harmonious Combination 
and Synthesis of Light and Darkness. Only through this 
Synthesis may the Truth be arrived at, however, as the 
Son of Man, Who was also the Son of God, has before 
remarked "No man cometh unto the Father but by Me". For 
the Son is always the visible Aspect of the Invisible 
and Concealed Father, who may never be known because He 
Is the very Essence of our Being.

The most truly representative Man of his time is 
always The Beast, for he displays all the qualities of 
the Race of the Period in which he lives. We look at 
such a Man and see in him Ourselves, for we can only 
see what is within us. To some he appears an Angel of 
Light, to others the grinning Devil of Darkness. Thus 
is Genius always misunderstood and blasphemed by some, 
while recognized and praised by others. He is the Son, 
wherein Glory and Suffering are identical. He is always 
betrayed, always Crucified, as we see in the Path of 
"The Hanged Man" immediately below Tiphereth. This is 
the Path attributed to Water, and Water was the enemy 
of Horus. Why? Because his Mother was the Great Deep, 
and She was misunderstood and reviled as the Harlot 
because the true Father was invisible. Thus are Man's 
greatest enemies those of his own household. The Son 
must suffer on account of the fact that he is born of 
Matter, and the Soul within him is crucified, by those 
who see naught but Darkness, while that same Darkness 
conceals a Higher Light than their own.

See the proud followers of the White Tradition, 
whose Sun has the Head of an Ass. For Intelligence 
cometh from Binah the Great Mother of Understanding, 
and without Understanding the Way of Holiness is indeed 
Narrow. These are the people who are always Right, 
while the others are always Wrong in their sight. Their 
1/4 day additional in the Year makes them too proud to 
perceive Wider and Grander Spaces and Cycles.

But, as I hope to show, the age of narrowness is 
passing, and for the first time in 25,000 years, Man 
has the opportunity of coming into his own.



Chapter V

The Mystery of Babalon and the Beast

The Beast, or Man of the Sun, represents, as I 
understand it, the Soul of Humanity, or of Man, between 
Spirit and Matter, ashamed of neither since both are 
essential to His existence. The Substance of the Sun 
descends upon Tiphereth from Binah through the Path of 
"The Devil"; its Life is transmitted from Chokmah 
through the Path of "The Sun"; it exists as a Spiritual 
Idea through the Channel of "Shin" which descends from 
Kether. Kether is its Final and Efficient Cause, 
Chokmah its Formal Cause and Binah its Material Cause.

"ON" is the Ancient Egyptian Word for the Sun; as 
long as we are prepared to go ON, all is well since we 
are in line with the natural urge of Evolution. But we 
may rise above the ordinary idea of Evolution into a 
consciously free co-operation with the Divine Purpose.

The numerical value of ON is 120. This is said to 
have been the Age of Christian Rosencreutz at the time 
he passed ON.

Those who try to reverse the process of evolution, 
to retreat or retrogress, saying "NO" in their hearts, 
fall into Sin which is restriction, and therefore get 
themselves into trouble.

ON is formed of the Hebrew Letters Ayin and Nun, 
thus this idea arises at the junction of the Paths of 
"The Devil" and "Death".

People of the "NO" type arose on the other side of 
the Tree, on the Path of the Setting Sun. NO may be 
spelled Nun, Vau, or NU, who was called the Father of 
the Waters, the reflector of Nuit. 

However, we may look for a reconciliation of these 
ideas in the Path of "The Star" which represents the 
Sun at High NOON.

It was at High NOON that Parzival wrought the 
Miracle of Redemption, when the Spear and Cup were re-
united. This Path unites the Spear of Will and Wisdom, 
Chokmah, with the Cup of Understanding and Intuition, 
Binah. The Father and Mother being thus united, the 
"One Star in Sight", Har-Makhu, or Horus of the Star, 
is recognized in His True nature as the Spirit of the 
Concealed Light of Kether.

The Truth was never lost to the Supernal Triad, 
but the Supernals were lost to the sight of man. We may 
wonder how this could be, and the time is now ripe for 
its revelation. But before an attempt is made to 
explain this, it is best that we should glance at the 
remaining Paths of the Tree, below Tiphereth.

Let us consider the Path of "The Hanged Man", 
sometimes called the Redeemer. Exoterically this Tarot 
Key is said to signify: "Enforced and not voluntary 
suffering"; while Esoterically it means "Self-
sacrifice", but not as usually understood. 

ATUM or ADAM, as the first purely Human type or 
Soul, is said to have been Two-sexed until he became as 
Adam and Eve. Tiphereth is the True Son but the false 
Father.

When the representative Son at this stage became 
mistaken for the Father, many women followed Him, 
seeking redemption. Thus an embarrassing situation of 
"enforced and not voluntary suffering" might be 
supposed to have arisen. The only reasonable course of 
action would be a concealment of the facts and a 
teaching which might be inferred to imply "Chastity", 
Celibacy, and other doctrines of repression. This is 
merely the exoteric view, but it accounts for the 
mistaken zeal of some who failed to understand the true 
teaching.

The Physical Sun is just as impotent to fertilize 
the whole Universe, although He may be entirely capable 
of attending to His own Solar System. He is all right 
in His place in the Order of the Universe; only when we 
misunderstand that place, do we fall into error.

The same trouble might arise in the case of a man 
who preached a doctrine of promiscuous sexual 
intercourse to a following of women; even were he a 
regular Lion he would be unable to supply the needs of 
an unlimited number and therefore be liable to attempt 
to retract his teaching. 

The above instances could only arise on account of 
the lack of a true interpretation of the Words of the 
Justified One, Osiris arisen from Ammenti. Destruction 
is essential or there can be no renewal, and IU the 
twin-sexed supplies the answer if interpreted by means 
of "The Hierophant" whose Path crosses that of "The 
Hanged Man" and shows a reciprocal current between the 
Spheres of Venus and Mercury.

We have noticed how the twin-serpents "crossed 
over" below Tiphereth, and have studied the Symbolism 
rather fully. Having separated they must again re-unite 
in Yesod -- The Foundation -- and continue as One to 
Malkuth by the Path of Aleph, the Pure Fool.

We may now consider Malkuth, the Fallen Daughter, 
who, according to the Qabalah, in order to be redeemed 
must Unite with the Son, be raised to the Throne of the 
Mother, re-awaken the Father so that all things are re-
absorbed into the Crown.

This process has been much misunderstood, it has 
bee thought to imply a return to the Crown. The Mystics 
have all wanted to be re-absorbed into the Absolute. 
The Magicians, on the other hand, have tended to keep 
going ON, and to attempt to usurp the Throne of God, 
which rightfully belongs to the Mother.

Both met with a terrible Abyss, while working on 
the old methods.

The Magician traveled up the "Tree" till he came 
to Chesed as an Exempt Adept who had built up a 
wonderful system of knowledge, only to find the whole 
structure must be broken in pieces in the Abyss, if he 
hoped to Attain to true Understanding and Wisdom. Few 
passed this Ordeal.

The Mystics, on the other hand, being of the 
negative type, opened their minds and souls to the 
"light" and often mistook false lights for the True 
One. Having a very limited basis of experience as a 
foundation of their Pyramid, the Apex was 
proportionately low, and the Light they saw at that 
point, they attributed to their own pet divinity as 
their savior and redeemer. The Dawning of Solar 
Consciousness (Dhyana) tended to come as such a shock 
that most of these Mystics lost their balance for a 
time, if not for the remainder of their incarnation. If 
they went further, they were literally flooded with the 
Dark Forces of the Abyss. Some of these truly saw the 
Devil, and believed in him, and preached his existence 
to their followers. They certainly never say God.

Many of these people lived a very holy and chaste 
life, according to the standards of their time, before 
reaching this stage. Afterwards, the ignorant believed 
in them as men of good reputation, and were even 
content to "believe" without further desire for actual 
experience. 

So we find a line of "Theorists" arose, under the 
guidance of "Partly Disillusioned" people who feared to 
go further and so taught a doctrine of Fear which is 
the forerunner of Failure, a doctrine of implicit 
belief in the leader of the movement, amounting in some 
cases to a "blind faith" in Substitutes, Reflections, 
Vicarious Atonement, and anything else but the 
necessity of working out their own Salvation. Yet there 
is an element of truth even in such apparently absurd 
notions as Vicarious Atonement; just as we found an 
element of truth in the doctrine of the Devil. Every 
man and every woman who Attains, make it just that much 
easier for the rest of Humanity to reach perfection. 
The whole Race must eventually Attain, for it is bound 
together by the closest ties, so that the process 
cannot be finally complete in the individual until the 
Last has become as the First in the Kingdom of Heaven 
upon Earth.

We seem far from that issue, but the Way is now 
OPEN, as before it was Closed, for Horus the Opener has 
taken his Seat in the East at the Equinox of the Gods.

But, to return to Earth, or Malkuth, as the Fallen 
Daughter. The true teaching, as I see it, is this. 
Malkuth, the Sphere of the Elements, or Matter, has 
been mistaken for the Planet Earth in place of _All the 
Material Substance of the Universe in manifested form_. 
Matter, as we should know, is _continuous_.

The Sun is the God of this world, its Physical 
Father, and as such he is worthy of our utmost respect 
and reverence. We do well to salute and recognize Him 
as Ra in the four Quarters. We "see" Him in the Rising, 
the Midday, and the Setting Sun; we "believe" in Him as 
the Sun of Midnight, our "heads" tell us that He is 
Osiris of the Underworld.

These are the old doctrines of the "Eye" and the 
"Head" transmitted to our subconscious minds from the 
Paths of "Ayin" and "Resh". "Seeing is believing", is a 
saying that held sway until the Scientists showed us we 
could not believe in the testimony of our senses. But 
the whole doctrine of the Birth, Death and Resurrection 
of the Sun or Son, was based on this dogma.

Also, just as of old the Sut-Typhonians tradition 
became despised, so Woman has been despised and held 
down by Man, by the son who had usurped the place of 
the Father. In this Man is truly a beast, and it 
required a Greater Beast, a practical living example, 
to show him his error, folly and wrong-doing. But man 
misunderstands and fears the Beast, who after all 
offers him the Secret of the Solar Pathway to the 
Stars. Why does he fear? The old Dark Tradition in his 
subconscious mind, holds him back. He fears to enter 
the Darkness of Night, lest he lose what little light 
he has therein. But this is the result of his limited 
earth-bound conception, which is quite un-scientific 
and gross.

If we truly believe in Osiris (or Christ) why 
should we fear to descend with Him into the Underworld? 
Jesus is said to have done so, before he rose again in 
Spirit to His Father in Heaven, thus uniting His True 
Self with the Invisible Central Star of the Universe.

Day and Night only exist for us on this Planet; 
the Sun does not travel round the Earth for our 
convenience. We, on this Planet, travel round the Sun, 
revolving as we go. Thus his Light only reaches certain 
parts of the Earth at any one time, and the rest of the 
Planet is in darkness. The Sun is always Shining, and 
if we come to consider things from the point of view of 
the Sun, we shall begin to shine too.

But the Sun, although Father of this Planet, is 
but the Son of the Great Mother, the Star Universe. 
Where then is the True Father? This is the question 
that puzzled the old Sut-Typhonians in the earliest 
times. The difficulty arose through the original 
Illusions of Time and Space, which have kept the World 
in ignorance since the last Golden Age. The Universe is 
Infinite in the Here, but men have tried to 
circumscribe it. The Infinite is ever present in the 
Now, but Men have looked backwards and forwards as if 
time were a line. There are Two Infinites, or 
conceptions of the Infinite, the Infinitely Great and 
the Infinitely Small. The extent of the One escapes us, 
the Present Moment of Pure Being escapes us. The 
Infinitely Great, is Nuit, Continuous Matter, Mother of 
the Stars. The Infinitely Small and un-extended point, 
is Hadit, the Inmost Essential Self of All, the Flame 
that burns in every heart of man and in the core of 
every Star. Both these are invisible to our Senses and 
Minds.

Since these are the Infinite, the Center is 
Everywhere and the Circumference Nowhere. Every point 
in Space is equally the Center of the Whole, there 
being no Limit. The True Father is Invisible, but the 
Center of all. Men called him "Father Time" but he is 
Father "Now." The Now became extended as the Serpent of 
Time, Saturn, who tempted Eve, Matter, and caused the 
Fall but Now is the accepted Time, Now is the Day of 
Salvation. The Illusion of Space, on the other hand, 
made it difficult to imagine or find the Center; study 
the Stars as we would. Imagining a possible Limit, men 
failed to perceive how that Center could be everywhere 
present at the same moment of Time.

The Long Lost Father, Hadit, is the true Life of 
All, and the Eternal Energy of All. Matter and Energy 
can never be separated, one always merges into the 
other in a continuous and continual Marriage Union. The 
Universe, as we know it, or may come to know it through 
Spiritual Perception, is the Result of that Union, the 
Crowned Child in the fullest sense.

Men and women of this Planet may think of the 
Secret Father as the Sun, till they draw that Sun 
within the Heart, and look at things from His 
viewpoint. This is the Balanced and Harmonious 
conception of the Great Beast which is MAN. Then we 
realize that the whole Solar System revolves around Its 
Central Sun, and so on to Infinity. There is No Limit 
to the Expansion of Consciousness in the Here and Now, 
for Hadit, the true Father is Now in each one of us, 
veiled by the Light of the Sun of our being, His 
Manifest Son of Light. Truly the Kingdom of Heaven is 
within us, it will never be found outside amid the 
illusions of space and time. Those who have sought the 
Kingdom of Heaven within, have rejoiced therein; but 
that is an experience each must Attain for himself by 
Work. Let us then return to the general discussion of 
the subject.

We have said that Malkuth was mistaken for the 
Planet Earth, which she only is in a narrow sense. If 
united with the Son, or Sun, she begins to view the 
universe from His standpoint. Around her revolve the 
planets of the Solar System, of which Earth is one of 
the smallest. But it is said she must be raised to the 
Throne of the Mother from which she fell. She must be 
understood as the Original Substance, or pre-elemental 
matter. Also her throne is the Sphere of Saturn, the 
outermost of the (then known) planets. On reaching 
Solar Consciousness she must not imagine that she has 
arrived at the Goal. This is the mistake made by those 
who are obsessed by the results of Dhyana, the earliest 
Illumination. She must _expand_ to the Rim of the 
Wheel, the Orbit of Saturn. She will gaze at the Great 
Zodiac, the Star Universe in Chokmah. She will seek to 
absorb this as the Father, her True Mate, and in so 
doing will Expand to Infinity as Nuit, The Ain, finding 
Kether, the True Father of Her Being, or Hadit, at Her 
Center, made Visible by the Extended Light of the Ain 
Soph Aur, which is Ra-Hoor-Khuit, the Lord of the Aeon. 
Having been assumed unto Heaven her effort will be to 
Contract upon the Center, and to Bring forth the Child. 
But she is Virgin, and the child is not born but "Ever 
Coming." The Force and Fire of the Universe ever 
Expands within Her. Thus we may conceive of the Two 
Infinites multiplied in the Crowned Child.

All these Mysteries may be discerned Spiritually 
by the Children of Earth who have within them the Light 
of the Crown. Man, the Microcosm, the Little Universe, 
is like unto God the Macrocosm. This is the great 
Mystery. The Soul, Malkuth, is capable of taking into 
itself, Spiritually, all that is in the Macrocosm, 
until able to think the One Thought of God, which is 
the Universe itself.

The Animal Soul is that which perceives and feels, 
without it we may not perceive or feel the Joys of the 
Universe. Despised as the Fallen Daughter, it is our 
greatest Treasure, for it is The Kingdom of Heaven upon 
Earth. We may now understand the Mystery of Revelation, 
of the Woman Clothed with the Sun, becoming great with 
Child. How the Beast, tried to Devour the Child, and 
stop further progress, in order that he might continue 
to be Worshipped as the Lord of Heaven. How the Woman 
escaped into Egypt, or expanded to the limits of the 
Mother of Sut, the Orbit of Saturn and so on till the 
True Child was brought to Light within Her and the 
light of the Sun and Moon were no longer needed, for 
there was the Crowned Child in the Midst of the Holy 
City.

So we may learn, through the expansion of our 
consciousness to the conception of Babalon and the 
Beast, to pass ON to the Greater Conception of Nuit and 
Hadit, and obtain our heritage of Cosmic Consciousness, 
as the Crowned Children of the New Aeon. This was 
prophesied by the Beast Himself, who made it his life 
work to teach; "First obtain the Knowledge and 
Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, the Higher 
Self, in Tiphereth the Kingdom of God in the Heart, and 
all things shall be added unto you."

Is it not written in the Qabalah: "Kether is in 
Malkuth, and Malkuth is in Kether, but after another 
manner"? This statement has been misunderstood owing to 
the limitations of our minds. Malkuth is NUIT, and 
Kether is HADIT, and when united RA-HOOR-KHUIT, their 
Son is in Tiphereth. Also Nuit has said "My number is 
Eleven, as are all their numbers who are of us." Kether 
is 1, Malkuth is 10, together Eleven, which is the Lost 
Sphere of DAATH, the Child of Chokmah and Binah. This 
is the Mystery of the Path of Aquarius, The Star, the 
Eleventh Sign of the Zodiac, brought to Earth at the 
Eleventh Hour, before Time had swallowed the Last of 
His Children, which shall be as The First in the 
Kingdom of the Here and Now.



Chapter VI

Further Light on the Tree of Life

We should now try to understand the Mystery of 
"The Tree of Life which is one with the Tree of 
Knowledge." It is written: "The letter killeth and the 
Spirit giveth life."

The Structure of the Tree of Life as represented 
in our diagram is evidently a Divinely given Plan of 
the Multi-dimensional Sphere of the Universe, in Two-
Dimensions. When we examine it superficially it means 
little or nothing; gradually, as we absorb the Divine 
Ideas reflected through its medium, our minds take on 
the Image and Likeness of God, and we are enabled to 
comprehend all in Spherical form.

The Qabalah teaches us to think of a greater and 
greater number of things, in the light of fewer and 
fewer Ultimate Ideas, as has been shown in the chapter 
on "The Essence of the Practical Qabalah." The highest 
Reason which is in God and which is God, is absolutely 
One. God knows all things by One Idea, which is 
identical with His Being. 

The limitations of Time and Circumstance obsess 
us, and we are at first unable to grasp the Divine 
Plan. Tradition is the result of the Thought of 
Humanity in the "past" focused in the Present, the Here 
and Now. So it is in regard to what we term the 
"future." The Plan of the Tree of Life gives us an idea 
of the Unchanging Basis of the Here and Now, in time 
and space.

The Reformulation of the Paths has made this 
clear; we have seen how the past leads to the Present, 
and glimpsed a Vision of the Great Light of the 
Beginning, which will Dawn on Humanity in the "future." 
Those who are able to comprehend may obtain this Reward 
Now. Nuit has said: "I give unimaginable joys on earth, 
certainty, not faith, while in life upon death, peace 
unalterable, rest, ecstasy, nor do I demand aught in 
sacrifice." Or as Christ said to one of the two thieves 
(Time and Space), "This Day shalt thou be with me in 
Paradise"; and on another occasion; "Now is the 
Accepted Time, Now is the Day of Salvation."

Let us examine the Tree of Life again in order 
that we may further grasp its mystery, and how it comes 
about that the New Aeon is possible in Human 
Consciousness. We must use the language of time and 
space, but we shall be informed of the Spirit if our 
minds are open to the Truth. 

Horus, the Ever-Coming Son, is said to have 
appeared under many forms, as the Great Cycle of the 
Precession of the Equinoxes progressed. The Complete 
Cycle is said to be 25868 years; though in more ancient 
reckoning it was 26000 years, when the year was taken 
to represent 360 days. 2155 Years represents one Sign 
on the Grand Zodiac, and every 2155 years Horus appears 
in a new guise. About 11,030 B.C. He would have 
appeared in the Sign of Leo, as the Lion God. If we 
examine the position of this Path on the Tree, we find 
it unites Tiphereth and Netzach. It is my opinion that 
the consciousness of Humanity during that period would 
be particularly influenced by that Path, and that the 
flower of the race could not have held conceptions 
above Tiphereth. They may have obtained a glimpse of 
the Sun as Ruler of the Elements. About 8875 B.C., 
Horus would be manifest through Cancer, as the Beetle, 
and the summit of Human consciousness would be lowered. 
Thus the age would seem one of retrogression, until 
Horus, dipping down into Yesod, re-ascended under the 
Moon's Influence thus entering Gemini. This seems 
indicated in the Tarot Trump "The Moon" where we notice 
the Beetle coming up from the Pool beneath the Moon. 
About 6720 B.C. He entered Gemini and appeared as one 
of the Twins. Consciousness would balance that of the 
Leo period, and tend to ascend to Tiphereth. In 4565 
B.C. Horus entered Taurus, appearing as a Calf. Moses 
seemed to consider the worship of the Calf a 
retrogression, and we see that the Path of Taurus is 
again below Tiphereth. In 2410 B.C. we find Him 
appearing in Aries, as the Lamb. This represented a 
distinct rise in the Race Consciousness, which however 
took on the Strong but Severe aspect of Geburah. This 
period was a Natural One, for the Constellation Aries, 
would coincide with the Sign of Aries in the Earth's 
Aura or Elliptic. This conflicting Time Cycles would be 
reconciled. Then, in 255 B.C. we find him as the Fish, 
the Path balancing that of Aries, and having the 
Influence of Mercy predominating. Thus it was till 1900 
A.D. when He appeared to enter Aquarius. But what a 
startling change. Suddenly we find Him on a Path 
uniting the Supernals of Wisdom and Understanding, and 
Their direct Influence made possible in the Minds of 
the Race. Not since the previous Golden Age 25000 years 
ago had the Influence of this Path been felt. No wonder 
men looked to the Sun as the Father, and even in the 
Pisces period only understood the lower Aspect of 
Jupiter. Once again in this Aeon we are able to 
recognize the Great Mother of the Stars, and to 
discover the Secret of the Lost Father.

There is also a Trinitarian Cycle of Father, 
Mother, Child, running parallel, so to speak, with this 
Tradition of the Evercoming Horus. It is the Natural 
Formula of Isis, Osiris, Horus, and is of Solar Origin. 
From 2419 B.C. to 255 B.C. Isis the Mother was said to 
be the Predominant Aspect of the Trinity. Hers was the 
Office of Nature, She presided over the Natural opening 
of the Great and Little Years which both coincided. 
Then Osiris, Dead and Re-Arisen, was the predominant 
object of Worship till 1900 A.D., and self-sacrifice 
and Renunciation were the principal exoteric formulae. 
In this present Cycle Horus is doubly pre-dominant, so 
we see Him in his Dual Nature as Horus-Harpocrates.

It is also interesting to note the character of 
Horus as Apophis the Avenger. The Isis, Osiris, Horus 
arrangement is quite the natural one for the course of 
events. Isis (The Moon) having taken the place of the 
Great Mother Nuit. But what of the Formula IAO, as 
Isis, Apophis, Osiris? If we make a list of several 
repetitions of the series thus:

Isis

Osiris

Horus

Isis

Osiris

Horus

Isis	etc.

and trace them back, we find the order Isis, Horus, 
Osiris, etc.; or Isis, Apophis, Osiris. Horus appears 
as the avenger Apophis to those who try to GO BACK, or 
retrogress. He has to destroy them in order that they 
may be renewed. But as long as we go forward, we travel 
with the Ever Coming Son, who is after all our Destiny, 
since He is within each of us as the True Urge of our 
Being. This, then, is the secret of the Way of the TAO; 
step boldly out on the Path of Destiny, having aligned 
the personal with the Divine Will, and thus prepared 
oneselves for the acceptance of that Destiny. Keep 
ahead of the urge from behind, and it will not fret us.

Then we become Free, Goers, Doing the Will of God 
upon Earth, Ever-Coming Sons of God.

But if we attempt to lag behind to carry out some 
personal whims and wishes, Destiny catches up with us 
and forces us on. To those who willfully turn back and 
seek to avoid cooperating with the Divine Plan, Horus 
is the Great Avenger. Has he not said "I am a God of 
War and of Vengeance. I will deal hardly with them." 
Thus at his Coming in 1904 he found the Race in a state 
of definite retrogression. "Civilization" met him as he 
advanced in triumph, and millions fell, without 
understanding what was happening. He still drives ahead 
in His Chariot, and millions more will feel his Force 
and Fire, until the Race recognizes that it must right 
about face, and cheer the Conquering Hero on. Then we 
shall have Peace and Rejoicing, and the Stern Warrior 
will seem as the Gentlest Child.



Chapter VII

The Law of Thelema

To some, this book will come in the nature of a 
challenge, to others as the fulfillment of the Covenant 
symbolized by the Rainbow of Hope. Some will understand 
readily, some will desire to understand and seek 
further enlightenment, others will partly understand 
and try to forget what they have read, some may 
definitely disagree. But one thing is certain "The sin 
which is unpardonable is knowingly and willfully to 
reject truth, to fear knowledge lest that knowledge 
pander not to thy prejudices."

I have tried to avoid the unpardonable sin by 
keeping an open mind for all that seemed to express an 
aspect of truth, even where I failed to understand the 
full significance of the teaching.

Take, for instance, the statement of the Master 
Therion "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the 
Law," which has been much misunderstood by some people. 
When I first heard this statement, many years ago, it 
shocked and surprised me; it did not seem possible that 
such a doctrine could be of universal application. But 
I did not reject it on that account.

When I read the "Message of the Master Therion," I 
found it clearly stated and explained that "Do what 
thou wilt" does not mean "Do what you like." What then 
does it mean? That I have tried to discover, by means 
of experiment, and I have found, as stated by Therion, 
that far from leading to "license" it becomes the 
"strictest possible bond."

One can hardly fail to realize that we have been 
living in an age of "restriction" which has led to most 
direful results. But the solution of the difficulty is 
evidently not to be found in a mad breaking away from 
all authority and order, a running wild with cries of 
"freedom" and "liberty" only to find ourselves more 
enslaved than before. What then is the solution of the 
difficulty? I will endeavor to tell you how this 
teaching has worked out in practice in my life and 
consciousness.

I considered the matter seriously and said "If do 
what thou wilt shall be the _whole_ of the Law" it 
evidently applies to all mankind. In that case my own 
personal will is but a little part of the will of 
Humanity, and in doing it I must learn first of all to 
consider other people's wills more than anything else. 
If all the people come to do their wills, what is left 
to be done must be my will, and my course become clear. 
Therefore let me learn to mind my own business, cease 
to make any attempt to interfere with the will of 
another, and see what results.

I found, as soon as I was less anxious to tell 
everyone else just what, in my opinion, they should do, 
I gained many true and devoted friends, who have never 
since deserted me, except through the change called 
death. People seemed to feel that I had no personal axe 
to grind, and gave me their brotherly and sisterly 
confidence. I, at the same time, found there was a 
great deal it was my will to do, which no one else 
seemed interest in undertaking, so that I continued 
very happily doing what I felt to be right, without 
coming into serious conflict with anyone. I did not 
feel that my will was in opposition to the laws of the 
Country, or the City, and so these in no way restricted 
me in a personal sense. I began to feel this was one of 
the chief rules of life, a good common-sense business 
proposition. It seemed so plain that I almost wondered 
why people had not adopted it before. Then I began to 
notice its effects on others who were also endeavoring 
to live it. In some cases their interpretation at first 
seemed to be "Do your will regardless of the other 
fellow," but they very soon found this did not work at 
all in their dealings with me, at any rate. If such 
came along and made a rough demand, or a stupid 
statement of what he would, or would not do to me, I 
simply said "Go ahead and do it but don't expect me to 
help you." The result was in every instance, since 
there was no opposition and I didn't really care one 
bit, that his ardor cooled and he changed his mind; 
some better way having occurred to him at once. 
Opposition and resistance in such cases would have been 
just the same as helping the other person to fulfill 
what was quite evidently a hasty choice of action, and 
had I followed that course, I should not alone have 
done something I did not feel to be right, but have 
aided him to do something he would afterwards have 
found to be wrong, and we might both have bitterly 
regretted the transaction.

I began to realize that the True Will of Humanity 
as a Whole was the same as the Will of God for Humanity 
at this particular stage of their development. 
Therefore by trying to help Humanity as a Whole, 
without distinction, as far as in me lay, I could learn 
to do the Will of God, or the True Will. I found this 
entirely satisfied my "personal will" for I realized 
that I was living for a greater purpose than I could 
personally formulate as a plan of action by means of 
the little "will." Herein then lay the secret of "Do 
what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law," it was a 
divinely sent promise to encourage Humanity in its Hour 
of Darkness. 

The more I endeavored to live up to this Law, the 
easier I found it became. It is very nearly the same as 
the Law of least resistance, for one takes advantage of 
the Inertia of the Universe.

There could be no turning aside, it became a 
Conscious and Free fulfillment of Destiny, a co-
operation in the plan of the Great Architect. This Plan 
became clearer and clearer. Problems that had perplexed 
me for years, gradually solved themselves, without 
effort on my part. Things I had tried hard to do, by 
means of the personal will alone, became easy. I 
obtained all the personal pleasure of the fulfillment, 
without the effort to attain them. I learned to tackle 
each problem at the time it arose, and to clear it up 
while it was small. My "duty" became plain, and it was 
my Will to do it while I had the opportunity. I found I 
had just enough work to do properly, without time to 
spare to do anything for others they could better do 
for themselves; but there was always enough time to 
help another on a point I could obviously clear up, and 
on which he really needed my help.

I began to notice calls on my attention from 
"outside" and to give them prior consideration. That is 
to say, if something "came to me to do" I tried to do 
it with my might; but I curbed, as far as possible the 
tendency to "look for trouble" that would not otherwise 
come my way. Thus I am finding "Do what thou wilt" is 
helping me to find _my particular place_ in the scheme 
of things. I am beginning to like all I do, which is 
much more satisfactory that trying to "do what I like."

This book is one of the results of my course of 
action. I spent many years as an Accountant, which work 
I did without it being particularly congenial to me. I 
found it became possible for me to make a living in 
more congenial ways, so that I became happier, if not 
so well off financially, than I had been. At the same 
time I feel that the result of my researches, which 
have given me great pleasure and keen enjoyment, may be 
of real service to those whose work does not permit 
them to apply the same amount of time to preparation 
and study that I have been able to devote to it. More 
of my brothers and sisters may therefore profit by my 
work, than would have been the case had I continued 
with my profession as an accountant.

In the light of this book, in which, I hope, 
shines a glimmering of the Universal Tradition, the 
statement "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the 
Law" will be even plainer to humanity. It is literally 
the TOUCHSTONE of our lives. This one thing which makes 
Man more than animal is the power of will or choices of 
action; the power of Intelligent Purpose. The Black 
Tradition interpreted this power wrongly, and thought 
by "personal will" to usurp the Power of God. God was 
Invisible to them, they could see no reason why they 
should not do anything they liked, regardless of the 
other fellow, so long as they had the power or the 
money to carry out their ambition. The White 
Brotherhood, while receiving the Will of God, allowed 
their Interpretation of that Will to become so narrow, 
that they felt themselves alone to be Right and all 
others Wrong. Such are the reformers, however well-
meaning. But the Universe is the Perfect Work of a 
Perfect Being. If we see wrong in it, it is owning to 
our own limited outlook.

THELEMA, or "Do what thou wilt," is a TOUCHSTONE 
in this respect. If we accept it and interpret it to 
mean the doing of the "personal will" only, we find 
Destiny steps in and stops us. If we still persist, 
willfully going against the Divine Will, against what 
is for the Good of Humanity as a Whole, against the 
Natural Urge of Evolution; trying to interfere with the 
will of others, and to usurp the Divine Right of every 
man and every woman to be THEMSELVES; we meet Horus the 
Avenger, and are deservedly smashed out of all 
recognition, ready to be made over again some other 
time when Nature has nothing better to do.

If we grudgingly submit to Fate and allow 
ourselves to be slowly pushed along by the Evolutionary 
process, we cannot expect much comfort or success. We 
are practically slaves, little better than animals.

If, on the other hand, we accept Divine Law, 
search our Hearts in the effort at all times to 
discover the Will of God within us, and to put our 
personal will in line with the Divine; we shall become 
Men and Women with a True Purpose. We shall step on the 
Road of Destiny, which is one with Free-will so long as 
it be God's Will, with a certainty and Courage which 
will be a living example and help to all around us. We 
cannot teach better than by example. Let us then seek 
constantly to do the Will of God which is our own True 
will, and we shall soon realize "There is no law 
beyond: Do what thou wilt!"



Chapter VIII

The Tradition of the Golden Age

A great deal more might be said on this subject, 
in fact it is truly inexhaustible, for fresh Light is 
Ever Coming.

There are one or two points which seem of 
particular interest and importance, and these I should 
Like to mention in the present treatise, so as to make 
is as complete and comprehensive as possible, as far as 
it goes.

I feel I have submitted fairly substantial 
evidence in justification of the Reformulation of the 
Order of the Paths, but I may point to some other 
interesting facts.

Firstly, the Path from Malkuth to Yesod is Aleph. 
Above Yesod and below Tiphereth we find the Paths of 
Vau and Mem, forming a Cross. These together are AUM, 
the word whereby we may prolong Dhyana, etc. But since 
M, the last letter is a closed sound and represents 
Death, we have been using the Word AUMN for some time, 
as this prolongs the Breath through the nasal sound of 
N, thus showing that Death may be overcome. We find the 
Path of Nun, N, or "Death" immediately above Tiphereth; 
so by this means we may be said to pass ON. This 
formula brings us directly in contact with the Channel 
of the Holy Spirit, or Shin.

I may say a new Ritual was revealed to us early 
this Year. I do not intend to describe it on account of 
its great Power. It might be a hindrance rather than a 
help to those unprepared for it. All I shall say is, 
that what we may term the 1923 Qabalistic Cross has the 
effect of Enlightening the Subconscious Mind by means 
of Wisdom and Understanding, thus enabling us, while on 
Earth, to ascend through the Power of the Breath, 
overcoming Water and Fire in the Light of the Spirit. 
Those who are ready will understand without further 
explanation. The Ascending Sign is that of Apophis as 
the Triple Flame.

While mentioning formulae we might also point out 
an exact correspondence to that of the Ritual of 
Mercury as indicated in the present arrangement of 
Paths. Taht, or Mercury, assisted Horus, be it 
remembered, in his struggle against the Powers of the 
Waters, by means of his Knowledge of the luni-solar 
reckonings. The Ritual states "The Sun is thy Father, 
thy Mother the Moon, the Wind hath borne thee in its 
bosom, and Earth hath ever nourished the changeless 
Godhead of thy Youth." In other words: The Sun 
(Tiphereth) is thy Father; thy Mother (Mem) the Moon 
(Yesod); the Wind (Aleph) hath borne thee in its bosom; 
and Earth (Malkuth) hath ever nourished the Changeless 
Godhead (Hadit) of the Youth (IU).

Now let us discuss a slightly different aspect. 
The Root of the word Qabalah is QBL, meaning "to 
receive." The Numeration of QBL is 132 which suggests 
the Supernal Triad. The word Qabalah is in Hebrew QBLH. 
The Final He suggests the Daughter, Malkuth. Kether, 
Chokmah, Binah, are the Sephirotic Roots of the 
Elements Air, Fire, and Water. Malkuth alone is 
attributed to Earth which is a compound of the other 
three. Therefore QBLH implies that Malkuth is "To 
Receive" the "Roots" of the Primordial Elements 
directly from the Supernals, and is composed thereof.

It has been shown how the Path of "The Magician" 
is directly representative of the Will and Wisdom of 
the Father in Chokmah, or of Yod of Tetragrammaton. 
Also how the Path of "The Empress" is directly 
representative of the Understanding of the Great Mother 
Binah, or of the He of IHVH. Again how the Path of "The 
Fool" transmits the Power of Vau, the Son, and of the 
Spirit or Shin. We find all these within the Daughter 
or final He, which becomes one with IHShVH, which, as 
326, has also been shown to be the numeration of 
PARChVAL the earliest spelling of the Fool which is 
Aleph, the One who is in All. 326 is also indicated in 
the Descending Triad of Binah, Chokmah, Tiphereth; 
symbolizing that Tiphereth is also within Malkuth in 
the Complete Sphere, of which Malkuth or Nuit is the 
Infinite Circumference, Kether the Invisible and 
Infinitely Small Center, or Hadit; while Tiphereth, as 
Ra-Hoor-Khuit, is the Finite Universe, capable of being 
absorbed into the Heart or Soul of Man, half-way, so to 
speak, between the Infinites. The Sphere of the Moon, 
Yesod, is the Subconscious Mind of Humanity which 
absorbs the Solar Seed of Truth, and reflects it to the 
Individual Soul.

This can be shown in another manner. If we take 
Malkuth as the Planet Earth, the Air (Aleph) circles 
round it. Then comes the Orbit of the Moon. We may 
imagine Yesod circling round Malkuth with her 
reflecting surface always toward it. This orbit of the 
Moon may be fittingly taken for the Aura of the Earth, 
capable of receiving every impression and transmitting 
it to the Subconscious.

Malkuth and its Moon travel round the Sun, 
Tiphereth, and the elliptic is the Aura of the Earth in 
a larger sense; since the Signs of the Zodiac retain a 
fixed relation to the Earth as imaginary divisions of 
this elliptic, even though the actual constellations 
have changed their positions owing to the precession of 
the Equinoxes. This causes the actual Constellation to 
extend its influence through a different Sign. For 
instance, at present (since 1900), the Constellation of 
Aquarius exerts its influence upon the Sun, through the 
Sign of Aries, and this influence is transmitted to the 
Earth.

This Orbit of the Earth, is however a part of the 
Aura of the Sun, which may be said to extend to the 
Orbit of Saturn. (More properly Neptune in the light of 
modern discovery.) 

Between the Earth and the Sun, as we look to Him 
as a Center, revolve the Planets Mercury and Venus. If, 
therefore, we Worshipped the Sun as our main objective, 
we should find ourselves traveling to a false Center. 
So we must turn our backs to the Sun, looking at things 
from His point of view, while still on the Earth, and 
around us will appear the Orbits of Mars, then Jupiter 
and then of Saturn, outside which are the 
Constellations of the Zodiac, and so on. From this 
symbolical viewpoint we may begin to absorb all these 
within us, as before stated in a slightly different 
way.

Now the Sun is ever the Son of the Star Mother, 
but as Father of Earth He transmits the prevailing 
influence of the Starts to the Earth through the medium 
of the Moon's orbit. If, from Earth, we look up at the 
Sun at the Vernal Equinox, which opens the Year, we 
should see him with the first Degrees of the 
Constellation Aquarius as a background. The Sun's Aura 
is particularly affected by the Influence of this 
Constellation, during the 2155 Years it appears back of 
the Zodiacal Sign of Aries in the Earth elliptic. The 
Life-force from the Sun is therefore charged with this 
influence, and all on Earth are accordingly affected. 
The Breath, or Prana, of the Sun is transmuted in the 
Body of Man, and he tends to become the Type of the 
Aquarian Age. This is a purely Human Sign, of the 
Water-bearer who carries the Waters of Life fearlessly. 
Horus has overcome the terror of the Waters, his 
ancient enemy, and to him that overcometh shall be 
given of the Waters of Life freely.

One could draw many parallels from the Scriptures 
to show that this is the Age of Fulfillment; even the 
FULL-FILLING of MAN with the Water of Life. Readers 
may, however, be interested in tracing some of these 
for themselves in "Revelations" and elsewhere.

We should remember, however, that Horus is the 
Ever-coming Son. This is not merely His second coming, 
any more than the last manifestation was His first.

At the risk of repeating myself I want to point 
out once again, from the Tree of Life, what a very 
important Age we have entered. In the last period, the 
influence of the Path of Pisces being predominant, it 
was next to impossible to rise above the Sphere of 
Chesed. Jupiter was the Highest conception of the 
Father known to man. It was an age of Mercy, 
unbalanced, and tending to aid and abet evil, just as 
the period before that was Over-severe and cruel. 
Without tracing all these paths again, let me once more 
say that the Path of Aquarius (if our plan is accepted 
as the correct one) is the ONLY Path of a Reciprocal 
nature among the Supernals, and the only Zodiacal Path 
above the Abyss. Therefore the coming period of 2132 
years, is the ONLY period in the Cycle of 25000 years, 
when Humanity has the advantage of the True Light of 
Wisdom and Understanding. At the end of this period, we 
may expect another FALL, just as Lucifer Fell at one 
period, and Eve at another. Then the Influence will be 
in the Path of Capricorn, or "The Devil," and the Light 
will decline towards Tiphereth as the principal 
manifestation of God according to the "Eye" Doctrine.

We may now understand why it was that the Ancient 
Brethren of the previous Golden Ages, seeing all things 
clearly, and realizing the future as well as the past, 
made very effort to leave PERMANENT MEMORIALS and 
LANDMARKS for the guidance of Humanity who would arise 
during the twilight and dark periods that must 
inevitably follow HIGH NOON. Our endeavor during this 
cycle should be to leave just such a permanent record, 
in Living form if possible. The formation of the Twelve 
Tribes as Living representations of the Signs of the 
Zodiac was just such an attempt in the past. The Jews 
were the IUs, representatives of the Ever-coming Son, 
the Wanderer, and thus they were called the chosen 
people. They were the people to which IUsaas came, 
hoping to find they still had a recollection of the 
Universal Tradition. But they had lost it, and did not 
understand. So He had to be content with promising the 
Gentiles that He would Come Again, and that next time 
it would be at the Eleventh Hours, in the Sign of 
Aquarius, and that the Golden Age would be renewed for 
a period. "In my Father's House are many mansions," He 
said, "I go to prepare a place for you." In other 
words, "This limited and restricted Sign of Pisces is 
which I am now appearing, leaves much to be desired." 
He knew He must be misunderstood, that the IUs having 
failed Him there was no chance of reviving the Lost 
Tradition, that the World would have to fulfill its 
destiny. He tried to explain to a few disciples, making 
each of the represent one of the Signs, so as to form a 
new Circle corresponding to the Tribes. Most of these 
have misunderstood, as time has shown.

Now He comes as a Conqueror, not as a Slave; but 
his chief weapon will be His Childlike Simplicity and 
His failure to perceive anything but good in all around 
him. For He knows that the Universe is the Perfect Work 
of a Perfect Being, that Existence is pure Joy, that 
the sorrows are but shadows, they pass and are done, 
but there is that which remains.

Now, in conclusion, let us say a few words in 
regard to Hermes, He who has given us His Book, the 
Tarot, as a true token of remembrance, of Whom we have 
one indisputably authentic record in the famous Emerald 
Tablet; all that is left of the Wisdom of Hermetic 
Philosophy of Ancient Egypt. Hermes prophesied that 
Egypt would fall, and so She did. He say there would 
come an end to the Golden Age in which He lived.

What says the Emerald Tablet. "True, without 
error, certain and most true; that which is above is as 
that which is below, and that which is below is as that 
which is above, for the performing of the miracle of 
the One Thing (or One Substance); and as all things 
were from one, by the mediation of one, so all things 
arose from this one thing by adaptation; the father of 
it is the Sun, the mother of it is the Moon; the wind 
carries it in its belly; the nurse thereof is the 
Earth. This is the father of all perfection, or 
consummation of the whole world. The power of it is 
integral, if it be turned into earth. Thou shalt 
separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the 
gross, gently with much sagacity; it ascends from the 
earth to heaven, and again descends to earth; and 
receives the strength of the superiors and of the 
inferiors -- so thou hast the glory of the whole world; 
therefore let all obscurity flee before thee. This is 
the strong fortitude of all fortitudes, overcoming 
every subtle and penetrating every solid thing. So the 
world was created. Hence were all wonderful adaptations 
of which this is the manner. Therefore am I called 
Thrice Great Hermes, having the Three Parts of the 
philosophy of the whole world. That which I have 
written is consummated concerning the operation of the 
Sun."

May Hermes, Thrice Greatest, guide the earnest 
seeker in his study of this book. May He enlighten the 
minds of those who study the Emerald Tablet, comparing 
it with the teaching herein set forth, the Keys of the 
Tarot, and the Reformulation of the Paths. It is enough 
if I add that the Three Parts of the philosophy of the 
whole world, the Three Supernals, now directly exert 
their Influence upon the Earth, through the Channels of 
Wisdom, Love and Power, and that in very Truth "That 
which is above is as that which is below, and that 
which is below is as that which is above, for the 
performing of the miracle of the One Thing" which One 
Thing is the One Thought of the Supreme and Concealed 
Father, as Manifested in the Ever-Coming Son.

  The Student will find a folding plate at the end of this volume, which should be opened out and 
used for reference while studying this and the ensuing chapters. All correspondences should be 
carefully traced while reading, if the best results are expected.
  I knew a similar case in recent years. The man was a weakling sexually and preached a 
doctrine of repression to his regular followers, while paying attention to one or two. All went 
well till the other women followers, who had repressed themselves to the point of serious 
neurosis, found him out, and he had to leave that part of the world.
