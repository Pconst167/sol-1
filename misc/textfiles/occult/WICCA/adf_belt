I. Starting the Ritual

  A) Processional : (starting Chant {Ku-Wa-Te})

     To enter the circle each person must pass through four "gates"
     representing each of the Three Worlds (Land, Sea & Sky) and Fire.
     Each person steps to the first Gate Keeper and is asked: "What do
     you ask of the Gate of Earth (Sea) (Air)?" AN answer is given or
     left unspoken, and the person is marked by the Guardian (with
     mud, water and brush of a feather) and proceeds to the next Gate
     and is questioned again. The Guardian of the last Gate, Fire,
     smudges the person before they enter the circle.
 
     When everyone is in the circle, the chant continues ("Ku-Wa-Te")
     as the Gatekeepers come into the circle and prepare themselves.
 
  B) Statement of Purpose :
 
     We are here tonight to honor the Goddess Danu, called the
     Earth-mother and to honor the God Belemos, Called the Sun King.
     We honor them and ask them to bless us and rekindle the warmth of
     the world.
 
  C) Centering Meditation:

     Group meditation and collective consciousness:

     All present are brought together with a group meditation, to form
     a "group-mind"; to help everyone center and bring themselves
     together to work in accord.

  D) Earth Mother Invocation :

         Oh Earth-Mother
         We praise thee
            That seed springeth
            That flower openeth
            That grass groweth
         We praise thee
         For winds that whisper
            Through the shining Birch
            Through the lively Pines
            Through the mighty Oak
         We praise thee
         For all things
         Oh Earth-Mother who gives life

II. The Active Ritual
