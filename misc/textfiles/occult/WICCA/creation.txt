     (AN ORAL TEACHING OF THE FAERY TRADITION OF WITCHCRAFT)


     Alone,  awesome,  complete  within Herself, the Goddess, She
whose  name  cannot  be spoken, floated in the abyss of the outer
darkness,  before  the beginning of all things. And as She looked
into  the  curved mirror of black space, She saw by her own light
her  radiant  reflection,  and  fell in love with it. She drew it
forth  by the power that was in Her and made love to Herself, and
called Her "Miria, the Wonderful".

     Their ecstasy burst forth in the single song of all that is,
was,  or ever shall be, and with the song came motion, waves that
poured  outward  and  became  all  the spheres and circles of the
worlds.  The  Goddess became filled with love, swollen with love,
and  She  gave  birth to a rain of bright spirits that filled the
worlds and became all beings.

     But in that great movement, Miria was swept away, and as She
moved  out  from the Goddess She became more masculine. First She
became  the Blue God, the gentle , laughing God of love. Then She
became  the  Green  One,  vine-covered,  rooted in the earth, the
spirit  of all growing things. At last She became the Horned God,
the Hunter whose face is the ruddy sun and yet dark as Death. But
always  desire  draws  Him  back  toward  the Goddess, so that He
circles Her eternally, seeking to return in love.

     All  began in love; all seeks to return to love. Love is the
law, the teacher of wisdom, and the great revealer of mysteries.
