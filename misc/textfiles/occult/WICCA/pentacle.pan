The Pentacle is a Magickal tool that some folks do not use.  Their reasoning 
is sound since it is obviously an adaptation from ceremonial Magick, as is the 
athame.  These people use only the wand and the chalice in their work.  But I 
like the use of the pentacle and athame because Wicca has always been quite 
ecclectic and drawn from several Pantheons and systems.  So it doesn't make 
any sense to me to say we can draw on all systems EXCEPT the Kabbalah as used 
in Ceremonial Magick.  Also I like the way using all 4 of these main tools 
that most traditions and practitioners share brings correspondences to the 4 
suits of Tarot cards and to the 4 elements.

The Pentacle is a flat disk, traditionally inscribed on copper and coated with 
a clear finish of some type to prevent corrosion after it has been inscribed 
with the continuos 5-pointed star or pentegram.  This is not an open pentacle 
like many witches wear.  It is ENGRAVED on the disk.  The reason being you put 
SALT on this disk in circle and if it was open all the salt would be on the 
altar, on the floor, everywhere but where you need it.  

I have also, recently, seen some pentacles inscribed on slices of agate put 
out by cauldron Crafts in Maryland that are JUST GORGEOUS.  Since the pentacle 
is feminine and relates to earth either the copper or the stone is 
appropriate.  However brass I find less so as it is usually considered a solar 
metal and masculine.  That is why I also prefer to avoid brass chalices.  
Copper chalices are avoided because they give off a metallic residue that is 
poisonous into the liquid, if they corrode - and alcohol in wine or ale and 
acid in wine or juice WILL do this.  But copper is perfect for the pentacle.

What you engrave on your pentacle is entirely up to you.  The NeoGardnerian 
and NeoAlexandrians (as well as the originals of these traditions) have very 
specific symbols that they always use.  Other traditions sometimes have 
specific symbols they require as well.  But others just use a plain pentacle, 
or tht pentacle with runic symbols of their choosing or whatever has meaning 
to them.  I have seen beautiful pentacles - in fact our distributor of jewelry 
carries them - that are pentegrams surrounded by inscribings of Celtic 
knotwork.   

I have also seen some gorgeous stained glass altar pentacles - my favorite of 
these was one where the points where the colors of the elements.  The 4 lower 
points were the Red, Yellow, BLue and Green my traditio ascribes to the 
elements and the top one was silver for Spirit/Divinity.  The center and 
background were a lovely violet color.  Obviously SOMEONE put a lot of work 
into it.

One note - a specific coating I have found to work well on copper pentacles so 
that the salt doesn't destroy them is CLEAR NAIL POLISH.  This has to 
periodically be reapplied however.
