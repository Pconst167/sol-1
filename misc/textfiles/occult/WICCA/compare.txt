Subj: CHRISTIANITY AND WICCA
The following is the comparison listing of Christianity and Wicca that I
mentioned in a previous message. It was prepared by Kerr Cuchulain, who is the
Canadian Chapter Head for the Witches League for Public Awareness, in response
to a request from a Christian minister who contacted the League.

* Names vary from tradition to tradition. lDifferent aspects of the
Goddess/God have different names creating the impression that Wicca may be
pantheistic.
** Wiccans use a book called the "Book of Shadows". This is a working notebook
rather than a scriptural text.
