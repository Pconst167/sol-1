        Well!  Having been fairly swamped with responses, I'm posting this
    to the whole net.  Note that I wrote it specifically for a women's
    group I belong to, but I'm sure it would be equally good in a mixed
    circle.  Comments are welcome, especially if you use it.  By the way,
    this ritual will be appearing in a two-volume book of rituals that will
    be coming out this fall from the Polly Theist Press (a new Wiccan
    publishing company), in trade paperback -- the real thing!  Wow!

RITUAL FOR WOMEN RECLAIMING THE GOD
 
        The session begins with everyone telling how the figure of the God
    had been "spoiled" for them -- ie, by patriarchal and/or sexually
    repressive religions, by the destructive aspects of male energy (war,
    domination), etc.
 
        The altar is decorated with symbols of the God -- ours had antlers,
    a crystal phallus, grain & grapes, a plastic goat from a Celebrator
    Doppelbock beer bottle, an abstract figure of Baron Samedi (a T shape
    made of dowels and dressed in a black frock coat with a top hat, a red
    scarf, and a cane), a couple of statues of Chinese sages or
    bodhisattvas.
 
        I. Quarters: E - Myrddin, S - Weyland, W - Taliesin, N - Freyr
    (sorry this is so sketchy; I just improvised them on the spot.  Check
    out their respective mythologies for ideas on how to invoke them)
 
II. Guided Meditation
 
	GROUND AND CENTER.  SINK INTO THE EARTH.  ALL AROUND YOU, THE
    BREATHING OF SISTERS BECOMES THE BREATHING OF THE WORLDS' WINDS.  THE
    HEAT OF OTHER BODIES BECOMES THE FIRE OF ALL LIFE.  THE RUSH OF BLOOD
    IN YOUR EARS BECOMES THE MURMURING OF THE SEA.  THE FLOOR BECOMES A
    RICH, LOAMY FIELD, FRESH PLOUGHED.
 
	FEEL THE SOIL.  RUB IT BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS.  SEE IT AND SMELL IT.
    IT IS DARK, ALMOST BLACK.  IT SMELLS OF COMPOST,SOMEHOW SMOKY.  IT IS
    SMOOTH, CRUMBLY, FREE OF ROCKS, FIRM TO SUPPORT ROOTS BUT LOOSE TO LET
    THEM SPREAD.  THIS IS MOTHER.  LIE DOWN UPON HER BODY AND EMBRACE HER;
    FEEL HER WARMTH, WARMTH FROM THE SUN, SEEPING INTO YOU, COMFORTING YOU.
 
	RISE UP.  AT YOUR SIDE, HANGING FROM YOUR SHOULDER, IS A BAG.  WHEN
    YOU REACH INTO IT, YOUR HAND COMES OUT FULL OF SEEDS.  WALK BACK AND
    FORTH IN THE FIELD, SCATTERING THE SEEDS.  FEEL THE SOIL GIVE UNDER
    YOUR FEET.  FEEL THE SUN OVERHEAD; IT IS HOT, AND YOU ARE GETTING
    TIRED.  KEEP ON, RHYTHMICALLY REACHING INTO THE BAG AND CASTING THE
    SEEDS ABROAD.  YOUR SWEAT RUNS OFF YOU INTO THE FURROWS, SOAKING INTO
    THE SOIL.  NOW THE WHOLE FIELD IS PLANTED.  NOW YOU CAN SIT AT THE
    FIELD'S EDGE AND REST.
 
	YOU ARE TIRED.  YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD REST FOR DAYS.  YOU
    SIT EASY, BALANCED, ROOTED LIKE A STONE.  YOU ARE A STONE.  YOU ARE THE
    GUARDIAN STONE OF THIS FIELD.  YOU WATCH, AS DAYS PASS.  SLOWLY,
    SLOWLY, THE SUN ROLLS OVERHEAD, CLOUDS FILL THE SKY AND EMPTY OVER THE
    FIELD WITH THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.  SLOWLY, SLOWLY, THE FIELD TURNS FROM
    BROWN TO GREEN, AS THE FIRST SPROUTS FORCE THEIR WAY FROM THE SOIL.
    DAYS PASS.  WEEKS PASS.  THE SPROUTS LOOK FIRST LIKE GRASS, THEN STALKS
    APPEAR AND GROW EVER LONGER.  AT THE TOP OF EACH STALK, SWELLINGS
    BECOME NEW SEEDS.  THE CLUSTERS OF SEEDS GROW, BLANKETED IN THEIR
    CHAFF, THE HEADS OF GRAIN GROW BRUSHY, BEARDED.  THE GRAIN TURNS GOLD
    FROM GREEN; THE HEADS BOW DOWN UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THEIR SEED.
 
	AND NOW YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE FIELD, WOMEN WITH SICKLES IN
    THEIR HANDS.  THEY ARE SINGING A DIRGE, A MOURNING SONG.  THEY COME
    INTO THE FIELD AND CUT THE STALKS, KILLING THE PLANTS!  YOU ARE A
    STONE, BUT YOU FEEL YOUR HEART BREAK WITH GRIEF FOR THIS KILLING.
    SOON, ONLY STUBBLE IS LEFT; THE WOMEN HAVE TAKEN THE GRAIN AWAY.
    BEFORE LONG, MORE WOMEN COME, AND SET FIRE TO THE STUBBLE.  YOU FEEL
    THE HEAT OF IT WARMING YOUR STONE BODY.  YOU FEEL CRACKS OPEN INSIDE
    YOU.  SOON, THE FIRE BURNS OUT, AND THE FIELD IS LEFT BLACK AS IT
    BEGAN.  THE WOMEN RETURN WITH SEEDS, PLANTING AS BEFORE.  THE WEATHER
    TURNS COLD, AND YOUR STONE-SELF CRACKS APART;  PIECES OF YOU FALL ONTO
    THE FIELD.
 
	YOUR AWARENESS IS IN THE FIELD NOW, IN THE SEEDS.  SLEEPING IN THE
    EARTH, UNDER THE SNOW.  WITH SPRING, YOU FEEL THE EARTH WARMING, AND
    YOU KNOW WITHOUT KNOWING HOW THAT THE SUN IS ABOVE YOU.  YOU PUSH
    UPWARD, TOWARD THE UNSEEN SUN.  YOU SEND DOWN A TAP ROOT TO HELP PUSH
    YOU UP AND TO FEED YOU, AND IN THE OTHER DIRECTION YOU SEND A SHOOT
    WITH TWO LEAF BUDS.  BEFORE LONG, YOU BURST OUT INTO THE SUNLIGHT.  ALL
    AROUND YOU ARE OTHER PLANTS.  AS THE DAYS PASS, YOU GROW WITH THEM.
    WHEN THE THUNDERSTORMS COME, YOU FEEL THAT THIS RAIN IS RICHER, AND YOU
    FEEL BLESSED.  SEEDS DRINK RAIN AND EAT SUNLIGHT AND GROW HEAVY UPON
    YOU.  YOU CANNOT HOLD THEM UP; THEY PULL YOU DOWN.  YOU ARE OPPRESSED,
    AND AT A STANDSTILL.  YOU SENSE MOVEMENT IN THE FIELD, AND THEN THERE
    IS A SHARP PAIN!  YOU ARE CUT OFF FROM YOUR ROOT!  YOUR POWER TO
    TRANSFORM SUNLIGHT SLIPS AWAY FROM YOU LIKE BLOOD!  YOU ARE DYING!  YOU
    ARE TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR MOTHER FIELD AND THROWN ON A HARD FLOOR.  YOU
    ARE BEATEN, BROKEN APART, SCATTERED.  YOU ARE DEAD.
 
	BUT SOME AWARENESS REMAINS WITH YOU.  YOU FEEL THE PIECES OF
    YOURSELF GATHERED UP IN HUMAN HANDS, AND THEN SCATTERED AGAIN, THIS
    TIME ON SOFTNESS.  IT IS MOTHER!  THEY HAVE RETURNED YOU TO MOTHER!
    AND NOW YOU ARE MORE THAN YOU WERE BEFORE; BEFORE YOU WERE A SINGLE
    PLANT -- NOW YOU ARE A DOZEN PLANTS.  THE CYCLE IS REPEATED, ALL OF
    YOUR SELVES ARE KILLED AND THROWN ABOUT, AND NOW YOU ARE HUNDREDS OF
    SELVES!  YOU DIE, YOU ARE TORN APART, YOU ARE REGATHERED, AND REBORN.
    YOUR HUNDREDS OF SELVES SPEAK IN THIS VOICE: EVEN THIS AM I, AND I AM
    GOD.
 
	COME BACK TO YOUR ONE SELF NOW, YOUR ONE HUMAN SELF.  YOU ARE
    SITTING BESIDE THE FIELD, WHERE YOU SAT DOWN, WITH THE EMPTY SEED BAG
    AT YOUR SIDE.  YOU LEAVE IT THERE, YOU RISE UP, AND TURN AWAY FROM THE
    FIELD, TO THE WOODS AT THE BACK OF THE FIELD.  YOU FEEL LEAF MOULD AND
    TWIGS UNDERFOOT.  ALL AROUND YOU YOU SEE LIFE SPRINGING UP OUT OF
    DEATH.  WHERE TREES HAVE FALLEN, NEW PLANTS ARE GROWING UP THROUGH THE
    ROTTING TRUNKS.  WHERE ANIMALS HAVE DIED, THEIR BODIES HAVE DECAYED TO
    PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE PLANTS ALL AROUND.  ALL AROUND YOU, LIFE IS LIVING
    OFF OF DEATH; THIS IS THE NATURE OF LIFE, ITS HORROR AND ITS WONDER.
    YOU HEAR A NOISE NEARBY AND TURN TO LOOK; THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT STAG
    JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A BUSH; YOU BLINK, AND IT IS GONE.  WAS IT
    ONLY BRANCHES?
 
	EVERYWHERE AROUND YOU, GREEN THINGS ARE FULL OF THE FIRE OF LIFE,
    AS ARE YOU.  YOU FEEL LIFE THRILLING THROUGH YOU, LIKE ELECTRICITY.
    SOMETHING ELSE IS EXCITING YOU -- WHAT IS IT?  YOU CANNOT QUITE TELL.
    IS IT A SCENT, A SOUND, A SENSE?  SOMETHING, THERE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR
    HEARING, SOMETHING YOU CAN ALMOST TOUCH, A FAINT SCENT YOU
    HALF-REMEMBER.  WHAT IS IT?  YOU ARE AROUSED AND DETERMINED TO TRACK
    DOWN THE SOURCE.
 
	EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, YOU SEE GLIMPSES, HALF-SEEN, OF SOMETHING.
    SOMETHING FLITTING THROUGH THE TREES.  IS IT A DEER?  A WILD BOAR?  A
    FERAL GOAT?  A BEAR?  ON THE BUSHES YOU FIND TUFTS OF HAIR.  BEFORE YOU
    YOU SEE TRACKS -- CLOVEN HOOVED, TOED, CLAWED.  WHAT ARE YOU FOLLOWING?
    DO YOU DARE GO ON?  ALL AROUND YOU IS THE PULSING OF ELEMENTAL FORCES:
    THE FIRE OF LIFE, THE WIND OF BREATH, THE WATER OF BLOOD, THE EARTH,
    THE EARTH, THE EARTH, POWERFUL AND DARK AND UNKNOWABLE.
 
	ABOVE YOU, THE SKY DARKENS, THE WIND RISES.  YOU HEAR THUNDER AND
    THE BAYING OF HOUNDS, CRYING FOR BLOOD AND DEATH.  YOU TREMBLE WITH
    FEAR AND EXCITEMENT; WHITE HOUNDS WITH RED EARS BURST OUT OF THE
    BUSHES, SURROUNDING YOU.  THEY GROWL -- BUT THEY ARE WAGGING THEIR
    TAILS.  ARE YOU THEIR PREY, OR THEIR MASTER?  YOU FEEL ANTLERS ON YOUR
    OWN BROW; ARE YOU THE STAG THEY HUNT, OR THE HUNTER WHO CARES FOR THEM?
    NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH THE DOGS, AND YOU FEEL THE LOVE OF THE
    PEOPLE, THE RESPECT.  YOUR DEATH WILL FEED THEM, GIVE THEM THEIR NEEDS,
    AND THEY ARE GIVING YOU THEIR LOVE.  YOU KNOW THEIR HUNGER, AND YOU
    FEEL GREAT COMPASSION FOR THEM.  YOU LIE DOWN AND LEAVE YOUR BODY TO
    THEM; THEY SING WITH JOY AS YOUR SELF FLIES UP OVERHEAD, OUTWARD,
    SPREADING, INTO THE TREES AND PLANTS AND ANIMALS AND EVERYTHING.
 
	YOU ARE SUDDENLY OVERWHELMED BY THE FEELING THAT YOU ARE BEING
    CAUGHT UP IN THE COSMOS; YOU ARE EVERYTHING AND NOTHING; YOU ARE NOT
    YOURSELF; YOU HAVE NO SELF; YOU FEEL A SUDDEN, UNREASONING TERROR; YOU
    ARE STILL; YOU ARE ALL.
 
	SLOWLY, SOMETHING BREAKS INTO YOUR FEAR.  YOU HEAR A SWEET, LOW,
    BREATHY PIPING.  THE PIPING CALMS YOU, AND YOU KNOW NOW IN YOUR HEART
    THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS A PART OF EVERYTHING AND EVERYTHING IS WITHIN YOU.
    YOU ARE STILL; YOU ARE ALL; YOU ARE LIFE AND DEATH AND REBIRTH; WITHIN
    YOUR OWN HUMAN BODY IS THE MICROCOSM OF ALL THAT IS.  THE GREEKS NAME
    THIS ALL "PAN".
 
	YOU STAND BACK IN THE WOOD, HEARING THE MUSIC, SMELLING THE SMELLS
    OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS, FEELING THAT PULSE OF POWER FILLING YOU,
    INFORMING YOU, EMPOWERING YOU.   YOU ARE ECSTATIC!  YOU TAKE TO YOUR
    TOES AND DANCE WITH JOY!  AROUND YOU, ANIMALS COME OUT OF THE FOREST TO
    DANCE WITH YOU, REJOICING IN LIFE!
 
	YOU SEE THE LIGHT OF THE SUN FILTERING DOWN THROUGH LEAVES, AND THE
    LIGHT SEEMS TO TAKE A SHAPE.  WHAT IS THAT SHAPE?  WHO DO YOU SEE?
 
	THE GOD STANDS, SMILING, WELCOMING, BEFORE YOU.  WHO IS HE?  HE IS
    ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE; WHAT IS HE TO YOU?  HIS EYES ARE SAD AND WARY
    AS A DEER'S.  HOW WILL YOU DEAL WITH HIM?  HE REACHES OUT TO YOU; YOU
    HAVE BEEN AS HE, YOU HAVE DIED AND RISEN, YOU HAVE BEEN THE LIFE OF
    WILDNESS, YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS BEEN WITHIN YOU AS YOU; WILL YOU WELCOME
    HIM BACK AS HE, THE GOD?
 
	YOU DO TOUCH HIM, AND WELCOME HIM.  HE THROWS BACK HIS HEAD TO
    LAUGH FOR JOY!  AND NOW YOU DANCE TOGETHER, AS ONE, FOR YOU ARE ONE.
 
	SIT UP.  FEEL YOUR BODY!  TOUCH YOUR BODY AND FEEL YOUR FLESH, FEEL
    THE HEAT OF LIFE UNDER YOUR FLESH.  BREATHE AND FEEL THE WIND WITHIN
    YOU.  MOVE, AND FEEL THE JOY OF THE DANCE!  RISE UP, AND DANCE THIS
    INVOCATION!
 
	HE IS THE STORM THAT SCOURS THE LAND 
	HE IS THE GUIDE OF HIDDEN WAYS 
	HE IS THE HOLLY AND THE OAK 
	HE IS THE HUNTER AND THE PREY 
	HE IS THE LORD OF STAG AND BEAR 
	HE IS THE SLAYER AND THE SLAIN 
	HE IS THE BLADE OF SACRIFICE 
	HE IS THE BLOOD THAT HEALS ALL PAIN 
	HE IS THE WORD THAT MADE THE WORLDS 
	HE IS THE SONG IN EVERY THROAT 
	HE IS THE IVY AND THE GRAPE 
	HE IS THE LORD OF RAM AND GOAT 
	HE IS THE HEAT IN LIMB AND LOIN 
	HE IS THE RAPTURE AND THE FRIGHT 
	HE IS THE FIRST LORD OF THE DANCE 
	HE IS THE FLAME UPON THE HEIGHT 
	HE IS THE SOWER AND THE SEED 
	HE IS THE STONE BESIDE THE TRACK 
	HE IS THE BEARDED HEADS OF GRAIN 
	HE IS THE LEAF AND BRANCH AND BARK 
	HE IS THE LORD OF HORSE AND BOAR 
	HE IS THE BLACKTHORN ON THE MOUND 
	HE IS THE PULSE OF WOODLAND'S HEART
	HE IS THE HOME AND HOLY GROUND 
	HE IS THE SALMON IN THE POOL 
	HE IS THE WINNER OF THE MEAD 
	HE IS THE HAZEL AND THE ASH 
	HE IS THE SECRET IN THE REED 
	HE IS THE SPEAKER OF THE RUNE 
	HE IS THE CORACLE ON SEA 
	HE IS THE SWALLOWED AND REBORN 
	HE IS THE RIDER OF THE TREE
 
        When all have danced to satiation, bring the dancing to a close,
    then say:
 
        LOOK AROUND AND SEE THE ALL IN YOUR SISTERS!  REACH OUT AND EMBRACE
    THE GOD YOU SEE THERE!
