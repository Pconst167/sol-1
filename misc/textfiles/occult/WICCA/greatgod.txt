                    Great God Cernunnos Invocation


HPS and HP turn to salute altar with the Horned God's salute as HP says:

HP:     "Great God Cernunnos, return to earth again !
        Come at my call and show thyself to men.
        Shepherd of Goats, upon the wild hill's way,
        Lead thy lost flock from darkness into day.
        Forgotten are the ways of sleep and night -
        Men seek for them whose eyes have lost the light.
        Open the door, the door which hath no key,
        The door of dreams, whereby men come to thee.
        O Mighty Stag, O answer to me !"

HPS & HP say:

Both:   "Akhera goiti 
        - akhera beiti !"               (lowering their hands)

 Witches"
-The Farrars say it is "the Invocation to Pan from Chapter XIII of 'Moon 
 Magic' by Dion Fortune, with ...[Cernunnons]...substituted for ...Pan".
