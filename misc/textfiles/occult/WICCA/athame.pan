An athame is traditionally a double-bladed knife with a black handle.  Very 
few people make their own, although it is possible to do so.  Most people 
obtain one and personalize it in some way.  This is most commonly done by 
inscribing symbols  or runes on it.  In some traditions specific symbols are 
required and have been handed down through their lineage.  In others and among 
ecclectic Wicca groups, these can be personal.

How do you do this?  You cover the blade with Parrafin. (WAX)  Then you let it 
cool.  Next you take a LONG sharp NAIL and inscribe the symbols in the wax.  
Then you use dilute Hydrochloric acid - careful, this stuff is dangerous, and 
drop by drop place on the blade where it shows through due to your 
inscriptions.  When the acid has worked - usually fairly quickly - you rinse 
the blade under running water THOROUGHLY and then you use VERY hot water and a 
lot of elbow grease to remove the wax.  

If ANY ACID FALLS ON THE SKIN RINSE THOROUGHLY UNDER COLD WATER IMMEDIATELY 
and if there is a burn of any type, seek immediate medical help.  IF it gets 
in the eyes, again rinse immediately and completely and CALL THE EMT/PARAMEDIC 
UNITS.  It is best when doing this if you wear either some type of glasses or 
goggles and rubber gloves.

DO NOT INGEST THE ACID OR LEAVE IT WHERE IT COULD BE INGESTED BY A CHILD OR 
ANIMAL.  Also be careful of how you dispose of the rest of it - do so in an 
environmentally SAFE way.

This sounded like a little too much for me, so I tried another method.  Koren 
made a beautiful athame for me and I personalized it by putting herbs of my 
choice in the handle and sealing this with a favorite crystal of mine - again 
with his help.

Oh, if you absolutely can't get a double-bladed knife - in Massechusetts, for 
example, possesion of such a weapon is a CRIME - get a single-bladed knife and 
grind down the other edge as much as you can.

As I said, the Athame is USUALLY black-handled, but there are exceptions - I 
saw one Lady use a knife with a deer's hoof for the handle.  She was oriented 
toward  her Native American heritage as much as her Craft, so it had deep 
significance for her.  I also saw - in fact a friend of mine was selling it - 
a BEAUTIFUL homemade athame with copper tubing forming a cross hilt and 
crystals in each of the three tips for the handle.  (this was almost a small 
sword)  AS ALWAYS USE WHAT SPEAKS TO YOUR OWN SOUL!!!!!

The athame is usully NOT used in circle for anything other than ritual and 
ceremonial purposed.  If you need to inscribe a candle for Magick or slice the 
bread for the cakes and wine part of the rite, you usually use a BOLINE or 
white - handled knife, often a small dagger or even a pen-knife, set aside for 
these purposes.
