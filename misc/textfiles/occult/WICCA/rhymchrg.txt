                  RHYMING CHARGE OF THE GODDESS

            I am the harmonious tune of the songbird
              And the laughter of a gleeful child.
          I am the bubbling sound of the running brook
               And the scent of the flowers wild.

             I am the floating leaf upon the breeze
            And the dancing fire in the forest glade.
           I am the sweet smell of rains upon the soil
          And the rapture of passion when love is made.

           I am the germination of seed in the Spring
              And the ripening of wheat in the Sun.
             I am the peaceful depth of the twilight
             That soothes the soul when day is done.

          I am found in the twinkling of an aged eye...
           And found in the birth of a newborn pup...
             Yes...Birth and Growth and Death, am I
            I am the gracious Earth, on whom you sup.

          I am your sister, your mother, the wise one.
           I wrap you gently in the warmth of my love.
           That which you seek you shall find within:
              Not without...not below...not above!

            Remember always, my children, be reverent
            Be gentle, loving and kind to each other
           And hold sacred the Earth and its creatures
             For I am the Lady, Creatrix and Mother!
