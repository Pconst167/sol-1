                   ==-> Witches Rede Of Chivalry <-==



             Insofar as the Craft of the Wise is the most ancient and most
   honorable creed of humankind, it behooves all who are Witches to act in
   ways that give respect to the Old Gods, to their sisters and brothers of
   the Craft, and to themselves. Therefore, be it noted that:



   { 1 }     Chivalry is a high code of honor which is of most ancient
           Pagan origin, and must be lived by all who follow the Old ways.


   { 2 }     It must be kenned that thoughts and intent put forth on this
           Middle Earth will wax strong in other worlds beyond, and return
           bringing into creation on this world, that which had been sent
           forth. Thus one should exercise discipline, for " as ye do plant,
           so shall ye harvest."


   { 3 }    It is only by preparing our minds to be as Gods that we can
           ultimately attain godhead.

   { 4 }    " This above all.....to thine own self be true..."


   { 5 }    A Witch's word must have the validity of a signed and witnessed

          oath. Thus, give thy word sparingly, but adhere to it like iron.


   { 6 }    Refrain from speaking ill of others, for not all truths of the
          matter may be know to all.


   { 7 }    Pass not unverified words about another, for hearsay is in large
          part, a thing of falsehoods.


   { 8 }   Be thou honest with others, and have them known that honesty is
          likewise expected of them.


   { 9 }   The fury of the moment plays folly with the truth; to keep one's
          head is a virtue.


   { 10 }  Contemplate always the consequences of thine acts upon others.
          Strive not to harm.


   { 11 }  Diverse covens may well have diverse views on love between members
          and with others. When a coven, clan, or grove is visited or joined,
          one should discern quietly their practices, and abide thereby.


   { 12 }  Dignity, a gracious manner, and a good humor are much to be
          admired.


   { 13 }  As a Witch, thou hast power, and thy powers wax strongly as wisdom
         increases. therefore exercise discretion in the use thereof.


   { 14 }  Courage and honor endure forever. Their echoes remain when the
         mountains have crumbled to dust.


   { 15 }  Pledge friendship and fealty to those who so warrant. Strengthen
         others of the Brethren and they shall strengthen thee.


   { 16 }  Thou shall not reveal the secrets of another Witch or another
         Coven. Others have laboured long and hard for them, and cherish them
         as treasures.

   { 17 }  Though there may be a difference between those of the Old Ways,
         those who are once born must see nothing, and must hear nothing.

   { 18 }  Those who follow the mysteries should be above reproach in the
         eyes of the world.

   { 19 }  The laws of the land should be obeyed whenever possible and
         within reason, for in the main they have been chosen with wisdom.

   { 20 }  Have pride in thyself, and seek perfection in body and in mind.
         For the Lady has said, " How canst thou honor another unless thou
         give honor to thyself first? "

    { 21 }  Those who seek the Mysteries should consider themselves as select
          of the Gods, for it is they who lead the race of humankind to the
          highest of thrones and beyond the very stars.
