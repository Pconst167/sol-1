----------
-A "standard" BOS usually lists its owner's standard modules so that they 
 follow each other, and optional pieces are probably given seperately with 
 no written explanation of how to put things together.  
-Obviously, the term "modules" is not traditional.  
-There are a large number of published sources for the Esbat ritual as a 
 whole.
