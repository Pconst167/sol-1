                        To Leave the Body


    'Tis not wise to strive to get out of your body until you have 
    thoroughly gained the Sight. The same ritual as to gain the Sight may 
    be used, but have a comfortable couch. Kneel so that you have your 
    thigh, belly and chest well supported, the arms strained forward and 
    bound one on each side, so that there is a decided feeling of being 
    pulled forward. As the trance is induced, you should feel a striving to 
    push yourself out of the top of your head. The scourge should be given 
    a dragging action, as if to drive or drag you out. Both wills should be 
    thoroughly in tune, keeping a constant and equal strain. When trance 
    comes, your tutor may help you by softly calling your name. You will 
    probably feel yourself drawn out of your body as if through a narrow 
    opening, and find yourself standing beside your tutor, looking at the 
    body on the couch. Strive to communicate with your tutor first; if they 
    have the Sight they will probably see you. Go not far afield at first, 
    and 'tis better to have one who is used to leaving the body with you.  

    A note: When, having succeeded in leaving the body, you desire to 
    return, in order to cause the spirit body and the material body to 
    coincide, THINK OF YOUR FEET. This will cause the return to take place.
