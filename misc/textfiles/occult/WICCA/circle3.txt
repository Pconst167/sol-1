                        Closing the Circle

When the Circle's work is done, R goes to the East, athame in hand, salutes, 
and draws a banishing Earth pentagram, saying:

R:      "Ye Lords of the Watchtowers of the East, ye Lords of Air, we thank
        you for attending our rites; and ere ye depart to your beauteous
        realms, we bid thee Hail and Farewell..."

All:    "Hail and Farewell !"                   (R extinguishes Quarter Candle)

Repeat for the remaining Quarters, addressing each with the titles by which 
it was invoked. 

R thanks and says goodbye to the God and Goddess. (Words To Be Decided.) and
extinguishes altar candles.

R then thanks and dismisses any spirits who have gathered.  

R:      "The Circle is open but unbroken. Merry meet, merry part and 
        merry meet again."

R extinguishes the Presence Lamp, saying:

R:      "This rite is ended !"

All:    "So mote it be !"
