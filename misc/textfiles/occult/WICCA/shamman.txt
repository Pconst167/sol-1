     Shamanism exists in tribal ccultures around the world and has done so for 
centuries.  Yet, in reading most anthropological texts on Shamanism, there is 
little, if any reference made to shamanism in Europe.  Howeverm Shamanism has 
existed among the peoples of Europe not only in ancient times, but also 
through the present day.  During the Middle Ages, the Old Ways largely 
disappeared from public view because of persecution.  Yet they were not 
erradicated but took a more underground existence.  Today, there are some of 
us of European ancestry that are bringing Shamanic ways rooted in 
pre-Christian Europe back into the light.

     Wiccan Shamanism is a term I began using several years ago in an attempt 
to describe my own path of magick and spirituality in relation to the other 
forms of Shamanism on the Planet.  Wiccan Shamanism draws on the Old but it is 
not simply an attempt re-construction and revival of the Old Ways of tribal 
Europe.  Wiccan Shamanism blends both the Old and the New to suit the modern 
times in wich we live.  Although emphasis is on European symbology and 
traditions Wiccan Shamanism is multi-cultural, incorporating ways of other 
helaers and magick workers from many places and eras.

     What follows is a glimpse into Wiccan Shamanism as I know it and practice 
it.  While Jim,Dennis, and others who help with various aspects of CIRCLES 
work may share many of these concepts, I speak here only for myself - for at 
the heartof this spiritual approach is the idea that each persoon must seek 
their own connection with the Divine, within their own Self, rather than 
having me or anyone else do this for them.  This is not a path of a leader 
with followers, but a path where each becomes thier own leader.

     I call to the Powers of the Four Quarters -- to Earth in the North which 
is the Realm of the Physical Body and Material Plane, to Air in the East which 
is the Realm of Thoughts and Intellect, to Fire in the South which is the 
Realm of Will Power and Action, and Water in the West which is the Realm of 
Emotions and and Intuition.  My Medicine Wheel is the Magick Circle which 
connects the Four Quaters.  The sacred places I frequent include a high rock, 
a crystal clear spring fed pool n a hidden valley and a circle of stones in a 
grove of Oak and Birch on a mound.

     I am a channel between Planet Earth beneath my feet and the Heavens above 
my head.  I become the World tree when I Shaminize, linking the transforming 
Dark of the Underworld with the Awakening Light of the Upperworld.

     I am the Crystal LIght that is at the Center of the Circle and is the 
fifth Element Spirit.  I seek always to act out of MY own Inner Self which is 
at the enter of MY being, for my Inner Self in the Balance of all the 
Elements, of my Female and Male sides, of my Lunar and Solar natures of my 
intellect and intuition my Inner Self is my doorway into the realm where All 
is One.

     I see the Circle of Life from the Center.  I watch the Seasons change as 
the Wheel of the Year turns and I clelbrate the 8 sabbats.  I connect with the 
dance of Night and Day, of Fair and Stormy Weathers, of the Waxing and Waning 
Moon.  I see the cycle of Birth, Growth, Maturity, Death, and Rebirth in all 
of Nature.  I examine the cycles of my own life and of the lives of those who 
seek healing aid from me.

     I am the traveler between the World of Daily Life and the Otherworld 
which is the land of Dreams, visions and Spirits.  I am a Consciousness 
Explorer. the Otherworldis as real and as important to me as the Day-to-Day 
World.  I bridge the Worlds rather than seeking to dwell solely in one or the 
other.  I journey into the Otherworld for a reason -- to bring back healing 
and knowledge to apply to Daily Life, helping others, myself and the Planet.


     I see the Divine in all things.  My friends and allies include not only 
humans but also plants, animals, rocks, winds, waters, fire, stars, and other 
life forms.  I commune with the Source some call "God" as both Mother Goddess 
and Father God, for both aspects are necessary for the Unity.
    
    The main focus of my Shamanic work is Healing.  I was called to this path 
as a young child in dreams and Out-of-Body experiences, but I didn't begin my 
work until my aduly years when I started Helaing myself.  To do this 
Ijourneyed alone into the Pit of my Shadow Self and came face-to-face with my 
problems and hang-ups; my doubts fears, disillusionments, rejections, angersm 
and hurts; with all MY false self images.  Words can not begin to express the 
misery, the utter despair the powerlessness I felt during this time.  Yet 
coming apart was essential; it enabled me to break through the barriers which 
I had formed and let others form in my psyche that had kept me from being one 
with my True Self.  In the deepest Darkness, I felt the Light of my own Inner 
Self beginning to shine through.  I focused on the Light and slowly emerged 
from the Pit, stronger and more integrated than ever before and with the power 
to heal others as well as myself.  As a result of this transformation process, 
my life's work became clear.  I now help others from thier own pits of 
negativity and become whole again.

    Yet my work also extends to more than Humankind; it involves bringing 
Healing to the Planet as a whole.  In my communing with the Land, I have heard 
the cries of the Earth mother, sorrowing over the self-centered, greedy, 
intolerant, and destructive behaviors of many of Her human children, who are 
polluting the soild, waters, and air; who are playing power games with nucler 
fire; and who are polluting the spiritual atmosphere of the entire world with 
their narrow mindedness and hate.  I am deeply concerned about survival -- not 
of the Planer Herself for all the humans in the world can not destroy Her even 
with all their weapons; She is too stong and powerful for that to happen.  
What I am concerned about is the survival of the human race. -- will we 
anhilate ourselves and many of the life forms around us, or will we wake up in 
time to see the larger picture, find and implement creative solutions to the 
worlds problems, and enter a New Age of expanded consciousness?

    The Balance of Life can be restored on Planet Earth; Harmony can be 
restored between humankind and other life forms; Love consciousness can 
increase and be prevalent on the Earth.  I, along with numerous other healers 
and ministers from a variety of spiritual traditions around the world today 
have responded to the upset of Mother Earth by dedicating our lives to this 
Planetary Healing Work, each in our own way.  It is this Great Work that 
underlies all the healing and other things I do.  It is the Heart of Wiccan 
Shamanism.
