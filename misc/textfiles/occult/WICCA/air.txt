-various sources including June Johns' "King of the Witches" (appendix),
 Starhawk's "Spiral Dance", Ellen Cannon Reed's "Witches Qabala" and a
 lovely pamphlet on the elements put out by Church of the Seven Arrows.
-putting elemental notes into the BOS (instead of in a Grimoire or in a set 
 of teaching notes) also appear's to be Khaled's idea
