  I face me to the east, an' Akila's there
  He's the fresh prince, he's the guardian of air.
  Homeboy'll guard us, protect us from the beasts,
  If anything ugly approaches from the east.
  (Akila... KICK IT!)

  Facin' to the south, and I got a mighty lion
  Leonos is my man, now you know I'm not lyin'.
  Comin' to the circle cuz I called upon his name,
  An' he's going to protect us, he's the guardian of flame.
  (Leonos... KICK IT!)

  Ormsilvern is the man when I face me to the west
  When you want it in the water, he's the one you want the best.
  Rise from the sea, come over to me,
  And tell the bad guys to f**kin' let us be.
  (Ormsilvern... KICK IT!)

  I make a right turn, and I'm headed for the north
  I'm callin' for the bull; yo, Taurus, come forth!
  Just call his name and the man is there,
  Holdin' up a circle with fire, water, air.

  By the powers of earth, air, fire, and water...
  ...keep it up, boyeeeeeeeez.
