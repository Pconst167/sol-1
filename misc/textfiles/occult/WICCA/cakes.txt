                        Cake Blessing


Follows: Wine Blessing

To consecrate cakes, HPS picks up athame again as HP kneels before her,
holding up the dish of cakes. HPS draws invoking pentagram of earth over
the cakes saying:

HPS:    "O Queen, most secret, bless this food unto our bodies;
        bestowing health, wealth, strength, joy and peace,
        and that fulfillment of love which is perfect happiness."

All sit as the cakes are passed around as was the wine.

HP refills cup and offers it to HPS, inviting her to join them.
When done relaxing and chatting, close the Circle.
