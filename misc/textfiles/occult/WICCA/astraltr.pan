RE: Astral Travel simplicity itself

The step by step instructions that I was taught, simillar to those in the 
LLEWELYN Practical Guide to Astral Travel, worked better for me - it took me 
alot of practise to get to where I could do it and it seems that for most 
people it takes practise, although some can do it spontaneously.  In fact it 
happens to some the first few times with no warning and then, after worrying 
they have gone crazy for a while, they later learn what it is. But I did just 
want to say for those like me for whom it does NOT come easy, not to get 
discouraged but to try working with it one step at a time.

Two interesting points about astral travel for me.  One is that I find it more 
interesting to explore the astral planes than to explore specific locations on 
this plane.  However when you are first learning, exploring specific locations 
on this plane can help.  Laurie Cabot suggests picking a store near you that 
you have never been in, try projecting to it, immediately on arising write 
down your impressions of it and then, as soon as you can, visit the store and 
check out your impressions.  If they are not all correct, don't be discouraged 
The example she gives is DID YOU SEE RED BEHIND THE CASH REGISTER AND IT'S NOT 
THERE?   Perhaps the cashier that day or evening was wearing a Red sweater!  
The longer you wait to visit the establishment, the more likely it is they 
will move something or change a display, so go soon after your visit.

the second is that I used to do it as a kid, no problem - right up until my 
Dad told me it was all in my head and I had imagined it.  Then I couldn't do 
it anymore.

A note here - My DAD, who used to be a hard-core skeptic, started attending a 
Spiritualist Church I hung-out at when he married my step-mother.  I find it 
humorous that originally he went there because it was non-denominational so 
you don't have to believe everything the ministers teach and because he liked 
the ministers, but he didn't buy the Psychic stuff.  Well, lately he's 
changing his mind as he's had some startling experiences.  I'm good, I'm nice, 
I don't tell him he is imagining things.  But I can't help laughing about it 
to myself just a little bit.

Oh, some of the stuff the Llewelyn book suggests is to practise opening your 
chakras first and grounding the energy,  work on that for 1 week to 1 month.  
WHEN YOU  HAVE IT DOWN PAT (be honest with yourself here or you can forget it) 
work on projecting a cloud of your energy out through your solar plexus (some 
people work better projecting from the 3d eye, I personally project the body 
through the solar plexus and when I project the consciousness into it, I do it 
via the 3d eye.  BUT since these are all merely visual aids to doing something 
non-physical,  I am not sure that it matters IF YOU ARE ACHIEVING VALID 
RESULTS) and leaving this energy as a cloud only then reabsorbing it.  YOU DO 
NOT PROJECT YOUR AWARENESS INTO IT.  You absolutely MUST reabsorb it.  That is 
done for a week or a month or however long it takes.  It is done by creative 
visualization until you get it to the point where you can feel that it is 
something more.   

Then you do the same thing for a week or a month, ONLY YOU SHAPE THE CLOUD 
INTO A SIMULCRAM OF YOUR BODY (if you are also trying to heal yourself, use 
the ideal form you wish to achieve - make it realistic and so it looks like 
you)  WITHOUT projecting consciousness to it, you send it out to watch a 
situation you can later check on for yourself.  When it comes back at a 
prearranged time later on, meditate for a while and write down your 
impressions AND DO NOT THROW ANY OF THEM OUT AS THEY SEEM SILLY OR IMPOSSIBLE 
- truth is often stranger than fiction.  Check on these later, DISCREETLY - 
don't TELL people you sent an astral traveler to them, say I HEARD THAT you 
went such and such a place today while I was in school so you can say to your 
mom that someone saw her and told you or something, OR just say it's a hunch, 
or, if you have the impression that your mom called your grandmother while you 
were in school, just say I WONDER HOW GRANDMA IS DOING? and see if your mother 
doesn't say, THAT'S WEIRD SHE CALLED ME TODAY.

PEOPLE GET PARANOID IF THEY THINK THAT YOU CAN WATCH THEM - AND THEY ALSO THIN 
K YOU ARE THE CRAZY ONE IF YOU SAY YOU CAN DO THIS.  Interestingly enough 
science (psychology) tells us that one of the classic symptoms of Paranoia is 
to think the OTHER person is crazy.

Always be sure to bring the simulcram back at the pre-arranged time and 
REABSORB IT!

The next step is to project consciousness into it, go out with it, and 
reabsorb the energy/substance afterwards - but only try this once you have the 
watcher exercise down pat.

THESE EXERCiSES SHOULD BE DONE FROM A MEDITATIVE STATE.

ALWAYS SHEILD YOURSELF BEFORE TRAVELING
