There is some controversy in both Ceremonial Magick and Wicca as to whether 
the Wand relates to the direction of the East or the South and whether it 
relates to fire or air as an element.  I am going to share here what I use and 
what works for me.  Others who work differently are more than welcome to share 
their usage.

The way  I use the wand in my Magickal working is as the tool for the EAST the 
element of air.  I can't PERSONALLY see the fire attribute, as I have problems 
with the idea of a tool relating to an element that can destroy it.  Since 
some wands are made of wood and almost ALL of them were until the 
popularization of Crystal work with the adoption by some NeoPagans of Native 
American practises made the metal wand with a Crystal in it the latest thing.  
If I WERE to work with people who used the wand as fire, I would certainly 
used a mettalic and stone wand of this type and NOT a wooden one.  Again, this 
is personal taste.

The air element relates to communication, intellectual ideas, Linear Logic, 
Clear and intelligent THINKING, and telepathy.  It relates to the concept of 
unity too, in that ALL of us - and all species of life - breathe the same 
atmosphere.  (note - I realize the plants use the Carbon Dioxide while we use 
the air, which is why I said ATMOSPHERE)

The wand relates to the suit of RODS in Tarot and vice versa.

The Wand is a MALE tool, like the Athame.  The FEMALE tools are the Chalice 
and the Pentacle.

The wand is used to summon the Rulers of the 4 directions and to invoke the 
Deities in casting a circle.  In CERTAIN types of Magick it is sometimes also 
used to cast the circle, but it is more common to use the athame for this.  
(or the sword if it is a coven and they have one)

The Wand can also be used when invoking the spirits.  

It is particularly helpful at times when wisdom is needed and in invoking the 
spirits before tranceworking where specific information or guidance is 
desired.  It is also good for doing this for VERY important divinations when 
they are done in a fully cast circle.

The wand is used in some traditions in a Spring Equinox celebration to create 
a hole in the soil in which seeds, symbolizing people's hopes, are planted - 
obvious fertility symbolism.  

The wand can hold a lot of power and be a very special and personal 
instrument.

There are some Witches/Pagans I know who use only the wand and the chalice as 
their tools.  Their thoughts on this being that the Pentacle is drawn from 
ceremonial Magick - which is correct - so they want to eliminate it as they 
feel it is necessary FOR THEM to get back to the roots of Wicca/Paganism.  
These people also eliminated the knife/sword because they pointed out that in 
ancient times Wicca was the religion of the Masses and the Peasants - who were 
not allowed to carry weapons.  These people use the wand to cast all their 
circles, replacing it for ALL the purposes for which the athame is used. 

Their are other groups, most noticably the Community of ISIS and it's inner 
circle the TEMPLE of ISIS in Salem MA., that use the wand for casting the 
circle although they retain the athame - which they seem to use only for 
blessing the chalice in the symbolic re-enactment of the fertility theme 
central to Wicca.  (PLEASE NOTE I SAID SYMBOLIC)

These are the major uses of the wand.T
