-various sources including June Johns' "King of the Witches" (appendix),
 Starhawk's "Spiral Dance", Ellen Cannon Reed's "Witches Qabala" and a
 lovely pamphlet on the elements put out by Church of the Seven Arrows.
-putting elemental notes into the BOS (rather than in a Grimoire or in a 
 set of teaching notes) also appears to be Khaled's idea
