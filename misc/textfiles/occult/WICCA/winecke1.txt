		WINE AND CAKES  ONE

A male witch kneels in front of the altar before a female witch. He holds up a chalice of wine and she holds her athame point down and lowers the athame into the wine. The man says:

	"As the athame is to the male, so the cup is to the female;
         and conjoined, they become one in truth."

The woman lays down her athame on the altar and kisses the manwho remains kneeling and she accepts the chalice from him. She sips the wine, kisses him again and he sips, rises, and givesit to another woman with a kiss. The chalice is passed around the Coven, man to woman, with a kiss each time, until the entire Coven has sipped the wine. The chalice can be refilled and any one can drink from it without repeating the ritual once the chalice has gone around once. To consecrate the cakes, the woman picks up her athame, and the man, kneeling before her, holds up the dish. The woman draws the Invoking Pentacle of Earth in the air above the plate while the man says:

	"O Queen most secret, bless this food into our bodies;
	bestowing health, wealth, strength, joy and peace,
        and that fulfillment of love that is perfect happiness."

The woman lays down her athame and passes the cakes to the man with a kiss, he passes them back with a kiss and they are passed around the Coven the same way the wine was. Be sure to save some of the wine and some cake for an offering to the Earth and the Little Folk. After the meeting, leave the offering outside of the house if working indoors, or behind inthe woods or field, when you leave if you are working outdoors.
