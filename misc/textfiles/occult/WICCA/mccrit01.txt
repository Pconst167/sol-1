                                Tiresias:____________

           In casting the circle, when calling the Quarters you are free to use
      your own words but we ask that you use Greek styling and personify with
      the names of the four Greek winds:

                                   North:  Boreus
                                    East:  Eurus
                                   South:  Notus
                                    West:  Zephyrus

           Tiresias seated north of altar rises, goes around to face altar, and
      invokes God and Goddess in a Greek style using these two triumverates:

                                         GOD
                                   Zeus:  Strength
                                  Hades:  Knowledge
                                 Poseidon:  Emotion

                                       GODDESS
                                    Hera:  Power
                                   Athena:  Wisdom
                                  Aphrodite:  Love


      He then step back and says:  "We have been called forth from the edges of
      Time and Space by one who seeks entry to the Halls of Olympus.  I am
      Tiresias, Prophet of Thebes, who, though blind, shall be his guide.
      Seeker, come forth!"

      Seeker approaches circle at north-east point of Circle.

      Tiresias:  "Who seeks entry to Olympus?"
      Seeker:  "I, __________.
      Tiresias:  "Before you enter, gaze upon one who sought what was not
                  rightfully his.  Do you still desire entry?"
      Seeker replies.
      Tiresias:  (If no, he leaves and circle is closed.  If yes):  "Then
                 enter and ask passage of the Guardians of the Gods."
      Seeker enters and they travel 1 1/8 to North.

      Tiresias:  "Hail, Mighty Hephaestus, Craftsman of the Gods.  With me is
                  one who seeks entry to Olympus."
      Hephaestus:  "How are you known, Seeker?"
      Seeker:  "I am called __________."
      Hephaestus:  "By what right seek you passage through the North?"
      Seeker:  "I have endured a year of the path of Earth and learned of my
                own mortality."
      Hephaestus:  "Pass with the Blessings of the Earth."
      They travel around 1 1/4 to East.

      Tiresias:  "Hail, Vigilant Artemis, Virgin Goddess.  With me is one who
                  seeks entry to Olympus."
      Artemis:  "How are you known, Seeker?"
      Seeker:  "I am called __________."
      Artemis:  "By what right seek you passage through the East?"
      Seeker:  "I have endured a year of the path of Air and have learned the
                need for focus of will."
      Artemis:  "Pass with the Blessings of the Air."
      They travel around 1 1/4 to South.

      Tiresias:  "Hail, Bright Apollo, Lord of the Sun.  With me is one who
                  seeks entry to Olympus."
      Apollo:  "How are you known, Seeker?"
      Seeker:  "I am called __________."
      Apollo:  "By what right seek you passage through the South?"
      Seeker has no answer.
      Apollo:  "You have not yet earned the right to pass through the South.
                To win this right, you must seek Fire from he who first gave
                it to Mankind, Prometheus.  Tiresias, guard him upon his path
                of Fire that he learn what he needs to face the Titan."
      They travel around 1 1/2 to North.

      Tiresias:  "I come with __________, who now seeks Prometheus that he may
                  gain the right to Fire.  What can you teach him that will
                  ease his path?"
      Hephaestus:  "Know that I am Hephaestus, Craftsman and Smith of the Gods.
                    In my labors, I use Fire as a purifying agent, seperating
                    the metal from the stone, and for the actual forging of my
                    Art.  But remember that creativity requires forethought.
                    Daedalus was a Master of my Craft, yet rarely considered
                    the implications of his creations.  He created the
                    Labyrinth of Minos, who then imprisoned him within its
                    intricasies.  He crafted wing that he and his son might
                    escape, yet in their flight Icarus died.  Always consider
                    the consequences of the which you create."
      They travel 1 1/4 around to East.

      Tiresias:  "I come with __________, who now seeks Prometheus that he may
                  gain the right to Fire.  What can you teach him that will
                  ease his path?"
      Artemis:  "Know that I am Artemis, Virgin Huntress.  Through my will, no
                 man has ever known me.  Yet will must be tempered by
                 intellegence.  Remember Otus and Ephialtes, twin giants who
                 were arrogant enough to think themselves better than the Gods.
                 They continued their ill-wrought plans, even after Poseidon
                 warned them.  Through supposed desire, they chose to pursue
                 me.  They seperated in pursuit of what they saw as a white
                 hind, and, with simultaneous throws, slew each other.  Thus
                 blind will caused the death of all they truly loved."
      They travel 1 1/4 around to the South

      Tiresias:  "I come with __________, who now seeks Prometheus that he may
                  gain the right to Fire.  What can you teach him that will
                  ease his path?"
      Apollo:  "Know that I am Apollo, God of the Sun and Keeper of Knowledge.
                Knowledge of Fire has allowed Man to forge a civilization.  But
                seeking to advance without can lead to catastrophe.  Witness
                Phaethon, who attempted to drive the Sun Chariot without proper
                knowledge, nearly causing the incineration of the Earth.
                Action without knowledge will often lead to ruin."
      They travel around 1 1/4 to the West.

      Tiresias:  "I come with __________, who now seeks Prometheus that he may
                  gain the right to Fire.  What can you teach him that will
                  ease his path?"
      Hestia:  "Know that I am Hestia, Goddess of Hearth and Home.  The warm
                glow of emotion in balance is vital for proper growth and life.
                But when emotions are allowed to rule above all else, tragedy
                is soon to follow.  Consider Paris, who upon seeing Helen,
                bowed to an all-consuming desire for her, kidnapping her
                without thought of the consequences.  Thus began the Trojan
                War.  Do not bury your emotions, but neither should you elevate
                them to the level of Ruler.
      They travel 1 3/4 around to the South.  Tiresias alone goes to altar and
      faces Seeker.

      Tiresias:  "Seeker, are you prepared to face Prometheus himself with your
                  request?"
      Seeker:  "I am."
      Tiresias:  "Then come forward and call him forth."
      Seeker goes to altar facing North.

      Seeker:  "From the depths of Time, I call you forth.  Arise Prometheus,
                Lightbringer."
      From within the members in the Circle, Prometheus rises and goes to north
      side of altar.

      Prometheus:  "I am Prometheus.  Who summons me here?"
      Seeker:  "I am __________."
      Prometheus:  "Why have you brought me here from the depths of Time?"
      Seeker:  "I seek the Gift of Fire."
      Prometheus:  "And by what right do you ask it?
      Seeker:  "By the right of perfect love and perfect trust."
      Prometheus:  "Then know that you are well met.  I will grant you Fire and
                    its path for a year and a day that you might learn its
                    lessons.  The most important lesson it can teach you is the
                    need for thought before action of any kind.  You must
                    always consider the consequences of all that you do or say.
                    At the end of your time on this path, you will be judged on
                    your fitness to continue your search."
      Prometheus gives Seeker a token of Fire.
      Prometheus:  "With my service done, I bid you farewell."
      Prometheus leaves, blending into Circle.
      Tiresias:  "Well done, most noble Seeker.Please join us for the remainder
                  of our revels."
      Seeker is given seat in Circle.  Tiresias faces front of altar and
      dismisses Deities using Greek styling and the following names:

                                         GOD
                              Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon

                                       GODDESS
                             Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite

      Each Quarter dismisses its element in a Greek style and dismisses the
      appropriate Wind:

                                   NORTH:  Boreas
                                    EAST:  Eurus
                                   SOUTH:  Notus
                                    WEST:  Zephyrus

      Tiresias:  "Our work is completed for now.  Let us rejoice and enjoy this
      company, remembering that though we may go our seperate ways, we are
      alway united as one.  Merry meet, merry part, and merry meet again!"
