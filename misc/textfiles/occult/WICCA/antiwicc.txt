For the past two years, I have monitored the Fundamentalist Christian radio
and television shows.  A surprising number of ministries and organizations
have demonstrated antipathy towards New Age and Wiccan interests.  Below is a
listing of those with whom I have come in contact, either via mail correspon-
dence, or through their appearance on radio and television shows.  This should
not in any way be assumed to be a complete list.  If you have names,
addresses, or phone #s to add to the list, please do so.  I would appreciate
being notified of any other names added to the list so that I can add them to
the files.  Thank You.

[My own notes are in square braces.  I keep a smaller collection than Rowan's,
but put the "Best Of" on-line.  Some of the rarer and more vicious stuff I'm
still trying to get ahold of.  The BBS phone number is (314) 389-9973.
