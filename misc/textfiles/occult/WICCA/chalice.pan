The use of the Chalice in Magick is as a feminine symbol.  It holds the juice, 
wine, spring water or ale.  IT is usually purchased but I have seen some 
hand-made ones that are gorgeous.  Pewter, Silver, silver plate, and pottery 
are the most common materials they are made of.   I knew a woman with a 
pottery chalice that had various Goddesses from all 5 races of the world 
painted around it, nude, with arms linked together.  This was her own work.  
It was NOT a great artist's work, but it reminded one of the primitive 
cave-paintings upon which our Craft revival draws for much of it's history and 
so was very beautiful in it's own right.  It was one of the most unique 
chalices I have ever seen.

Another witch I knew, who was ethnically Jewish, used a chalice that had a 
great deal of meaning for her.  It was her GRANDMOTHER'S Silver Kiddush cup 
used to greet the SABBATH BRIDE and draw the Shekinah Presence - also female 
according to Jewish tradition - into the home after the lighting of the 
Shabbat candles.  As this connected this particular Witch to her lineage and 
to her grandmother's spirit, it was expecially appropriate for her to use it - 
especially since she was an initiate of one of the offshoots of Gardnerian and 
Alexandrian tradition that draws heavily on the Kabbalah; which she emphasized 
more even than other H.Priestesses of those lineages due to her desire to 
remain connected to her background.

In some traditions a drinking horn is used instead of a chalice.  It is mostly 
used by those drawing from the Norse or Germanic legends in recreating their 
ritual structure, but really such a horn could be used by anyone.  You can 
make your OWN drinking horn far easier than making a chalice.  Get a cow's 
horn - usually available from farmers or from your local Tandy Leather store - 
and make a stand for it with heavy copper or silver wire that you wrap around 
it and form into a stand.  You can GENTLY engrave (DO NOT USE ACID FOR THIS) 
the horn or you can solder small gems and crystals to the wire stand or 
whatever else strikes you as being appropriate symbolism.  

But having a chalice or horn that IS YOU is important in your work, perhaps 
more so than any other article in Wicca which is so Goddess oriented.
