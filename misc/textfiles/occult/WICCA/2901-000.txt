2901

Once upon a time. . . .

. . . . I first spurred interest in T.O.P.Y. with the listening of
Dreams Less Sweet. After I proceeded to lose that tape to a young lady,
I decided to find out more about the sound and reasons of T.O.P.Y. I
purchased the live records series, which has proven to be a source of
great enjoyment. And I try to forward the ideas of T.O.P.Y. with
messages on the dorm door, and I try to play a few songs when I dj at
the campus radio station.

What I rather liked about T.O.P.Y. was that there was no forcing of
ideals on myself the listener. There are, I will not hold back, a few
ideals I do not in self practice, because they do not appeal to me, but
I will not condescend because someone else may. For the book, I do not
experiment with drugs, have sex, or denounce strongly non-pagan
religions. Persons may say that I have not lived, but that is someone
else's idea of living. If and when I wish to try something, I shall, but
until then I am content with myself. I guess the point is that it is a
choice, and one must not necessarily make certain choices to be involved
with T.O.P.Y.

The problem, well wait. Let us stay with that prior thought, about
choices, just for a minute. You may have noticed I don't spell certain
words the way T.O.P.Y. does; again I do not feel that is important for
me to reflect that thought to be considered involved with T.O.P.Y.
Anyway, as I was writing, the problem is I am afraid that I may not be
able to be as active as I wish in T.O.P.Y. with my schooling, because
education is very important to me. So, what I guess I am getting at, is
that I will do my best to do what I can. I can only hope that does not
sound too "wishy-washy". So, I am, will, try to do my most.

How would I explain T.O.P.Y. to a stranger? Simply, a group, tribe of
persons who are looking ahead, with little recourse to beliefs or
principles that have been embedded, sometimes unwillingly, into society.
An aim of reversal, getting people to quit taking for granted what
surrounds them, and having them realize they have control of their life,
and to use themselves to their potential.

Why do I feel T.O.P.Y. is important? Because it serves as a meeting
center for those persons who already know what they feel to get stronger
centralisation and organisation, and make themselves and their ideas
more available to others. It's got a lot to do with the concept of
awareness.

I guess aims and ideas have been taken care of. Sexuality, again, is an
awareness, realizing how present it is, and how it can be made into
something more wonderful than expected or known.

The Psychick Cross has so much behind it that it is rather hard to sum
up its meaning, besides representing a receptor for thought processes.
Also, I just rather thought that it could also be seen as a christian
cross overlapped by a satanic (inverted christian) cross, and a bar in
the middle to cancel the two out, which would go along with the theory
of bowing to no god.

23 is something I cannot comment too intelligently on, since I have not
the amount of information necessary. I have heard, however, that it is
the number of confusion, and actually, I myself have not much more of a
2902

view on it. . .yet.

Other resources of my self-determination, defining ideas clearly,
patience, art skills (with both pen and words), and desire to communi-
cate.

---------------------------------------------

Explanation of T.O.P.Y. to a Stranger:

I found this question difficult to answer as I do not know enough about
T.O.P.Y. People have asked me what it is, so I told them that it is an
information network and to contact T.O.P.Y. if interested. However, when
pressured I inform them of as much as I can, expanding on the ideas that
I know, and state that thee network runs all over thee country and that
depending on an individuals involvement information is available to
them; that it is up to thee individual, if they want, to becoum involved
and that one is not pressured into it.

To justify my involvement I would say that T.O.P.Y. has thee same or
similar beliefs to those I have always held, but from which I had
switched off as it was not "right" in thee conditioned world.

---------------------------------------------

On T.O.P.Y.

I have played PTV &/or T.O.P.Y. material for many friends, so I am often
asked about T.O.P.Y.

I tailor the answer to the questioner, telling no more than I think they
can follow at the time. Sometimes I describe PTV as a loose aggregate of
people working with music and video. I may explain that they are part of
a larger organisation which seeks to support people whose aims and
interests are outside the mainstream.

To people I trust I explain more. That T.O.P.Y. is a network of people
with some similarities and some differences, held together by a desire
to understand and short-circuit control. To explore ways to make what
they want to happen, happen. That T.O.P.Y. encourages people to find out
their true natures, not a shallow and generic, dictated and advertised
"identity".

One method is to exploit the cut-up, both on other material and
behaviourally as well. We constantly run on habit, and it is good to
break this up. Do you see friend X because you really want to? Or
because it's what you always do on Thursday night? A simple but
pertinent example.

Burroughs has been quoted as saying there was nothing special about 23,
just that it was something he noticed and then kept noticing. I see it
partly as a symbol of focus. That there is so much around that we screen
out daily, if we pick something not to screen out it will seem om-
nipresent. I also like the idea of it as a sort of mischievous number,
popping up with a will of its own where it has no statistical right. And
each time it pops up itself it reminds me of my psychic heritage that I
am reclaiming for myself.

2903

I see no particular sexual style that is representative of T.O.P.Y. It
is more an aspect of sex itself, that of the power (indeed - OV Power)
it contains. A power that can be frustrated by a denial of desire;
dissipated by investing it in removed, marketed images; or directed by
self-understanding and a ritual method. Since the sex drive is so basic,
and since social repression functions here as much or more than anywhere
else, sexual magick is a most powerful and empowering technique.

The particular interpretations of 23 and the Psychick Cross are not as
interesting or important to me as the fact that there are many
interpretations.

If a cynic - journalist or otherwise - is asking me about T.O.P.Y., I
believe it is important not to try too much to defend or to try to
convince the person that there's nothing horrid about us. I will,
however, try to dispel any basic misconceptions. I have found that so
much of what I take for granted is alien to many people that I cannot
explain parts of it. As I've noted, it took me a while to understand so
many foreign thoughts at once. If pressed by anyone who is obviously
hostile to and/or threatened by the ideas, I say "Well, I'm convinced of
it, it works for me, and I'm happy." I do not try to "convert"
them. If they are unaccepting of it, I give them some things to read,
and T.O.P.Y.'s address.

 ---------------------------------------------

T.O.P.Y. is an international network system, a kind of organisation that
brings in touch people who share ideas and feel free to do whatever they
like, as strange as it may be. That's the reason why T.O.P.Y. is
important. In times of loneliness, T.O.P.Y. tries to bring people in
touch, tries to bring back the lost innocence, the correspondence among
people. T.O.P.Y. hates everything and everyone who tries to limit its
freedom. T.O.P.Y. offers a method of living to better survive as a True
Being, and as an Individual, and not as part of the maze. Individuality
is expressed as Spirit and Will. "Love Under Will" is the meaning. To
manage it, T.O.P.Y. edits books, records, video tapes. T.O.P.Y. requires
belief in Magick and modern Paganism, and recognises the power of the
human brain.

The Psychick Cross means to me: Brain (upper bar); Heart (middle bar);
Prick - as the home of souls (lower bar). It means the Individual
itself, with its three psychic powers: Brain = dreams, fantasy,
cleverness; Heart = L.OV.E.; Prick = soul = the power that motivates all
the above.

The meaning of 23 is a mystic one, and people can only understand it
after long thought about T.O.P.Y.

---------------------------------------------

T.O.P.Y. is very important to thee continued growth of psychic awareness
in thee world. We have progressed physically as far as we can. Thee next
stage is mental.

T.O.P.Y. offers a series of mental training exercises: awareness
(especially ov yourself) is thee goal.

There is no obligation, as thee Temple is you.  Thee aims are immense.
2904

Education, realisation, principally.  Thee Temple can be anything you
need from it.  23 is thee pure number, completely random, a prime
number.  Thee Cross: a reflection of thee ego, a place to focus energy
and a simple, comfortable symbol representing a new strength in thee
world.

---------------------------------------------

Thee Justification ov T.O.P.Y.

Last night me and some members ov T.O.P.Y.S.T.E.E.L engaged thee "JESUS
ARMY" in verbal confrontation. It was in some ways an awakening
experience. It was also an experience which demonstrates thee necessity
for T.O.P.Y., PaganLink, O.T.O., etc.

To be confronted with thee organised inculcation of GUILT, FEAR and
LOATHING in militaristic form demonstrated the need for L.O.V.E.
organisations to provide the keys to self-(de)-programming.

To be confronted with INTOLERANCE and PSYCHIC VAMPIRISM showed the
horrible fate awaiting us if our society/thee earth is taken over by
thee forces of PERSONAL LIMITATION.

T.O.P.Y. provides a decentralised set of forums for individuals who wish
to escape our conditioned guilt and fear responses. It provides outline
methods for individuals who wish to acquire self expression, self love,
self discipline.

T.O.P.Y. is a will/energy focus. It's LOVE transmitting on all frequen-
cies.  True sexuality is a timeless moment of orgone mutation, thee
event where thee subconscious becomes all thee planes, thee times, where
it becomes an identity with thee conscious worlds. Liberation is only a
heartbeat away.

Thee Psychick Cross = pagan Cross. Sexual unions. Tree of Life,
qabballahs.  Thee planes, all in one. Thee sigil of Temple workings,
immanent in this cross, every working ever done before or in thee
future, happening now.  Thee sigil ov no name, thee blank sheet for our
experiences and desires to write upon.

23: No-one has ever satisfactorily explained to me how or why a computer
works. But I use one almost every day, and computers always touch my
life.  Similarly, 23 has not been totally explained to me, even in
numerological terms. Not fully anyway. Thee fact remains that 23 seems
to have some kind ov recurrent activity, in my experience. That does not
mean it will necessarilty be a feature of your experienced universe...

23 attaches itself in its various guises (32, 223, 123, 0-23, etc.) to
things I j- and many other YOUTH - are involved with. 23 seems to be a
sign of recurrent activity in thee universe, ov unifying themes.

---------------------------------------------

Justification of T.O.P.Y. to a cynical interviewer:

As rationality has failed to create a new mankind there are other
methods to be found of changing minds. The will must come from in-
dividuals, who, to reach their aims, gather in a group.
2905

Through the moral conditioning in childhood, school, military and the
general influence of language, media and moral systems, men are totally
controlled.  They control each other, oftenj without even knowing it.
The wishes, dreams of the body and subconsciousness are ignored and the
subject, so long as there is one, is conditioned to ignore it too. Only
functionality is important.

Life is shortened to operational functions to serve society. It is
degraded to a servant. As I feel unsatisfied by this, I need to escape
from this control and want to destroy it. I like to experiment with
other aspects of life. In this case, sexuality is an important factor
because it gives the individual a total conscience of its own existence.
It may help to find the inner self and break pre-formations. I like
sexuality. In orgasm, you cross the border. In orgasm you die. Your
coming back from another cone of reality after it. The coming to climax
is a way to ego-destruction.

---------------------------------------------

People are suppressed and conditioned by the socialisation processes of
our "society" - education, media, and the family - to believe in certain
attitudes and to behave in certain ways.

What has happened to individuality and the personality?

People should be taught to develop their own-selves and their own
personalities - To learn about instinct, nature, consciousness and
further heights of awareness, WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN PUSHED FROM OUR
MINDS.

The human mind is suppressed not to generate its "unacceptable" powers.

Meditation, creative visualisation, and MAGICK are important tools which
may be used to help bring out our true selves.

Sexuality is condemned from an early age. Society as a whole condemns
sexuality.

It is a beautiful experience - and can prove to be a very powerful and
magickal act - generating immense emotion and feeling.

The idea of PLEASURE AND PAIN is fundamental to the understanding and
experiences of people. Sex can exist within both concepts.

People should learn not to be ashamed of their sexuality, and sexually,
to share experiences with other individuals.

UNDERSTANDING, DEVELOPMENT, AND COMMUNICATION.

OUR AIM IS WAKEFULNESS.
OUR ENEMY IS DREAMLESS SLEEP

---------------------------------------------

Involvement with T.O.P.Y. means that I have broken away from the social
graces forced upon me by society. I am finding out what I really enjoy
to do, with my mental/physical attributes. I am learning to reach
further than before, to grasp the things that were previously beyond my
2906

reach.

T.O.P.Y. is a collective of individuals who, in a way, do not want to be
part of any group/social type. This is not as hypocritical as it sounds,
because each individual within T.O.P.Y. is going his/her own way, each
with differing goals, concepts of life.

T.O.P.Y. is important because it gives the individuals within a
confidence that others are trying to struggle against society. T.O.P.Y.
members feel as though they are not the only ones with a different point
of view. It gives the individual strength to succeed.

T.O.P.Y.'s aim is to help individuals attain their highest dreams, and
to help them accomplish their works and wishes in life.

---------------------------------------------

T.O.P.Y. allows thee individual a chance to know him/her self. I am not
sure if I would be able to explain T.O.P.Y. to a stranger. Recently I
was talking to a friend who told me she no longer wanted to be my friend
because I was involving myself with T.O.P.Y. She does not believe in
anything. Her point is that I would no longer be me and that I didn't
need T.O.P.Y.'s ideas to help me with my problems, that in time
everything works out in itself.

I disagreed with her argument, trying to explain that T.O.P.Y. would
help me with the goals that I want to obtain in my life, and that in the
past not all my problems have worked out by themself.

T.O.P.Y. asks for the individual to be clear in admitting their real
desires by discarding all irrelevancies and by asking yourself what do
you really want out ov life. The argument with my friend allowed me to
see that we were no longer friends and perhaps we never really were. How
could we have been friends when she would not allow me to be anymore
than I already was nor anything else that I could be.

T.O.P.Y. is not there to be occult. But a lot ov people have that
misunderstanding. People will always condemn the thoughts and actions ov
another.

There is someone who I am deeply interested in, who spoke ov tribal
living and the ideas ov T.O.P.Y. At that time I had no idea what he was
talking about and the shyness that we both have makes it almost
impossible to talk to each other. We are barely able to smile and say
hello, and I believe thru the Psychick process we will be able to speak
again. I will overcome the shyness that keeps me within myself and keeps
me from having what I really want from life.

T.O.P.Y.'s ideas are for everyone who wants to wake up fromthe dreamless
world that we are living in. It's for the individual who asks themself
what they want from life, and the rituals are there to make those
thoughts happen.

"Awareness ov your own energy is the awareness that flesh and spirit are
one, that thou art goddess, eternally linked, connected, at one with the
moving spirit ov all" (Starhawk 138)

T.O.P.Y. is there for thee individual who makes the coumitment to become
2907

aware ov thee energy that is inside us all. . .

---------------------------------------------

Magic has interested me from an early age - but I didn't have the best
informed beginning. I used to try telekinesis, telepathy, astral
projection,even levitation, all with varying degree of complete failure.
I had no concentration or confidence, and a very impatient streak. The
things I tried to do were very nice "tricks" but many of them are no
longer goals of mine. I see no reason now to attempt things for which I
had little aptitude, solely to impress others and build up my own social
standing. People are so cynical now, and maybe some of it has rubbed off
on me.

The Temple has shown me a practical side to magick which makes no
pretensions, I don't expect to be able to force the hand of chance with
minimum effort and concentration and nothing to inform me but a
half-read Aquarian Press book. In my future sigil work I shall aim to
overcome some of my less attractive tendencies, and build on my natural
talents and abilities. My ideal target will be a perfect self and not a
material manipulator. Maybe people should expect miracles because I
think if you believe in something enough then you are halfway to having
it, just as long as it's within and not without yourself.

I don't feel that I need to justify my involvement with anything, to
anyone.  People have an instant dislike and fear of things they don't
understand, but worse than this, an aversion to information which could
disrupt their secure, boring, featureless lives. To me, many of these
people are lost causes, I would prefer that they knew nothing of what I
choose to do with my life - which is too precious to spend arguing with
people who will never see sense for the simple reason that they don't
want to. This may seem a selfish attitude, but the example of Susan
Bishop is enough to put me off talking to journalists, and Christians,
for life. Let them remain ignorant and happy, they will never change.

---------------------------------------------

People like to control you. They want power and they achieve it. These
thieves are smart and they work off people's insecurities. CONTROL means
dictating how others should live and how to think. If you are afraid of
making these decisions for yourself (because of fear of failure, lack of
self-confidence, fear of death, and definitely laziness) then it is easy
to associate yourself with, and follow someone strong enough to make
decisions for you.  You are no longer responsible for yourself and no
longer have the burden or that responsibility. It is easier to identify
oneself with an already developed personality (hero/heroine) than go
through the never ending struggle of self-discovery. The insecure
robbers who feed off our weaknesses are the ones most people tend to
trust: our rabbis and priests who control through strict regulations and
traditions, our school teachers who take advantage of
the innocence and naivety of young children by presenting themselves and
their ideas as manifestations of god, and our media which depicts THE
acceptable lifestyle through slanted manipulations. These thieves are
aware of your trust and innocence, and intend on using those weaknesses
to control you.

The Temple Ov Psychick Youth is an organisation aimed at DE-control.
They do not wish to control you; they wish to liberate themselves. They
2908

offer suggestions on how you COULD liberate yourself, not how you SHOULD
liberate yourself. The process of liberation consists of many types of
research, such as the music group PTV. Members of the Temple feel that
there is no reason why life should not be "lived to the fullest" where
all one's NEEDS and DESIRES are fulfilled. Because there are so many
distractions to divert one's attention from one's goals, symbols are
invented to be worn, to be drawn, etc., to constantly remind, if not the
conscious, then the unconscious, of these goals. Ideally, through this
process laziness is combatted and the goals will more likely be achieved
since those goals are constantly on the person's mind. Because there are
so many distractions and limitations posed by the "controllers",
sometimes our deepest wants do not seem earthly possible, and we repress
them in our subconscious (a step towards neurosis) trying to dismiss
them. The Temple does not believe in repressing our needs and desires
(submitting to those "controllers"), because our personal needs are what
make us human and individual.

The Psychick Cross is the symbol of the "whole" person, uncovering one's
unconsciously hidden desires and obtaining them. The unconscious speaks
most loudly in our dreams and our fantasies. When we fantasize, our
desires usually take place in Utopian settings, and represent these
goals by creating collages including parts of our physical body to
personalise the symbol of our goal even more. This symbol reminds us
over and over again that this is thee want, this is thee self. Temple
members using this process end up understanding their needs and desires
better, are more able to satisfy themselves and succeed in life.

I personally enjoy making decisions and discoveries on my own. I will
not allow anyone to take that joy away from me. I enjoy my intelligence,
my talents, and discovering myself using the symbolic rituals suggested
by the Temple Ov Psychick Youth. T.O.P.Y. is an important organisation
because: 1) it shows people they are not alone in the struggle, and 2)
it allows people to exchange views, ideas, and solutions to better these
processes to liberate and satiate the individual self.

                          "What is Paganism" 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is the text from a brochure that BAPA puts out called
"What is Paganism" (author unknown)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

"WHAT IS PAGANISM?

"History of Paganism
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"The term Pagan has numerous common definitions.  Many dictionaries
define a Pagan as anyone not of the Judeo-Islamic-Christian religions.
Some people consider anyone who does not share their religion to be a
Pagan.  Still others believe that a Pagan is a person who is
anti-religion.  None of these "definitions" manage to capture the true
meaning of the term.

"To discover the core meaning of Pagan, we look back to ancient times
when the word Pagan referred to a person of the country, or a peasant.

{deletia... in summary, several paragraphs relating the history of the
Catholic Church and the poor peasants' inability to relate.  Brief
description of the "glory of the Goddess and God in each starry night"
and note of the inconsistancies of the original Pagan beliefs with the
Catholic church.  Also, several paragraphs detailing the development of
of the Church's campaign to expunge Paganism, some of the methods
employed and the subsequent Witch Hunts.  Finally, an overall summary of
the persecution.  If interested, let me know and I'll post it
separately.}

"Paganism in Modern Times
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Today, little is known about the Pagans who survived what is now often
called "The Burning Times."  Paganism, as it exists today, is best
described as the practice of any of a number of nature-based religions,
traditions that find their roots all over the world.  {Liana- sound
familiar?} Many modern Pagans call themselves "Neo-Pagans" to declare
their religion as a revival of the old beliefs.

{more deletia... in summary, two paragraphs comparing contemporary
Pagans to the peasants of old, extolling our intelligence and
involvement in technology.  Also a paragraph defusing the Satanism
comparison.  Again, if interested, let me know and I'll post it.}

"What do Modern Pagans Believe?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Paganism is actually a large umbrella containing a number of
nature-based religions beneath it, from the European-originated Wicca
and Druidism, to African Yoruba traditions and Hawaiian Huna.  As a
result of this diversity, it is impossible to make statements about the
beliefs of Pagans that will apply to *all* {italics} Pagans.  However,
some statements can be made that will, in general, apply to a vast
number of Pagans.

2910

"Many Pagans tend to:

"* Be polytheists, believing in more than one deity or more than
   one aspect of a single deity.

"* Be pantheists, seeing the God/Goddess force represented in everything
   around them.

"* Recognize the divinity of the feminine as well as the masculine, not
   seeing masculinity as a superior force.

"* Believe that the life force is sacred, and that nature, as a vital
   representation of that force, is divine.

"* Believe that all life forms are equal, sharing an equal claim to the
   earth as a home.

"* Believe that each individual is solely responsible for his or her
   actions.

"* Believe that the forces of nature can be shaped in ways commonly
   called "magical."

"* Believe that magical acts designed to bend one to another's will are
   manipulative, and not encouraged.

"* Believe that whatever actions a person takes, magical or mundane,
   good or bad, come back to him/her, sometimes threefold.

"* Believe that there is no single path to spiritual fulfillment, and
   that the individual must determine the spiritual expression most
   appropriate to him or her.

"* Believe in reincarnation, or some form of life after death.

"How do Pagans Practice Their Religion?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Many Pagans find spiritual expression through the practice of ritual,
or religious ceremony.  These rituals, often held at significant points
in lunar or solar cycles, offer an opportunity for Pagans to commune
with the godeesses and Gods, to celebrate the passages of life, and to
work magic.

{deletia... in summary, paragraphs relating techniques to "raise power"
explaining that we don't espouse "power over" (my words).  Also outlines
goals that many pagans have in mine when raising of power. Outlines the
sabbats, and relates the pattern of the seasons.  Briefly describes
Beltane and Samhain.  Once again, let me know if you would like to see
this text.}

"Each Pagan religion has its own special way of recognizing the passing
of the seasons and personal life passages.  Ritual offers a way to imbue
these moments with magic and reverence.

{deletia... last paragraph giving information on how the reader can
learn more about Paganism, specifically in the Bay Area, and relating
the goal that BAPA has in mind.}

                               INTRODUCTION

        You hold in your hands one the Great Books of our century fnord.
        
        Some Great Books are recognized at once with a fusilade of
critical huzzahs and gonfolons, like Joyce's ULYSSES. Others appear
almost furtively and are only discovered 50 years later, like MOBY DICK
or Mendel's great essay on genetics. The PRINCIPIA DISCORDIA entered our
space-time continuum almost as unobtrusively as a cat-burglar creeping
over a windowsill.

        In 1968, virtually nobody had heard of this wonderful book. In
1970,hundreds of people coast to coast were talking about it and asking
the identity of the mysterious author, Malaclypse the Younger. Rumors
swept across the continent, from New York to Los Angeles, from Seattle
to St. Joe. Malaclypse was actually Alan Watts, one heard. No,said
another legend -- the PRINCIPIA was actually the work of the Sufi Order.
A third, very intriguing myth held that Malaclypse was a pen-name for
Richard M. Nixon, who had allegedly composed the PRINCIPIA during a few
moments of lucidity. I enjoyed each of these yarns and did my part to
help spread them. I was also careful never to contradict the occasional
rumors that I had actually written the whole thing myself during an acid
trip.

        The legendry, the mystery, the cult grew slowly. By the
mid-1970's, thousands of people, some as far off as Hong Kong and
Australia, were talking about the PRINCIPIA, and since the original was
out of print by then, xerox copies were beginning to circulate here and
there.

     When the ILLUMINATUS trilogy appeared in 1975, my co-author, Bob
Shea, and I both received hundreds of letters from people intrigued by
the quotes from the PRINCIPIA with which we had decorated the heads of
several chapters. Many, who had already heard of the PRINCIPIA or seen
copies, asked if Shea and I had written it, or if we had copies
available. Others wrote to ask if it were real, or just something we had
invented the way H.P. Lovecraft invented the NECRONOMICON. We answered
according to our moods, sometimes telling the truth, sometimes spreading
the most Godawful lies and myths we could devise fnord.

        Why not? We felt that this book was a true Classic (literatus
immortalis) and, since the alleged intelligentsia had not yet
discovered it, the best way to keep its legend alive was to encourage
the mythology and the controversy about it. Increasingly, people wrote
to ask  me if Timothy Leary had written it, and I almost always told
them he had, except on Fridays whem I am more whimsical, in which case
I told them it had been transmitted by a canine intellgence --
vast,cool,and unsympathic -- from the Dog Star, Sirius.

        Now, at last, the truth can be told.

     Actually, the PRINCIPIA is the work of a time-travelling
anthropologist from the 23rd Century. He is currently passing among us
as a computer specialist, bon vivant and philosopher named Gregory
Hill. He has also translated several volumes of Etruscan erotic
poetry, under another pen-name, and in the 18th Century was the
mysterious Man in Black who gave Jefferson the design for the Great
Seal of the United States.

     I have it on good authority that he is one of the most
accomplished time-travelers in the galaxy and has visited Earth many
times in the past,using such cover-identities as Zeno of Elias,
Emperor Norton, Count Cagliostro, Guilliame of Aquaitaine, etc.
Whenever I question him about this, he grows very evasive and attempts
to persuade me that he is actually just another 20th Century Earthman
and that all my ideas about his extraterrrestrial and extratemporal
origin and delusions. Hah! I am not that easily deceived. After all, a
time-travelling anthropologist would say just that, so that he could
observe us without his presense causing cultureshock.
     I understand that he has consented to write an Afterward to this
edition. He'll probably contradict everything I've told you, but don't
believe a word he says fnord. He is a master of the deadpan put-on, the
plausible satire, the philosophical leg-pull and all the branches of
guerilla ontology.

     For full benefit to the Head, this book should be read in conjunc-
tion with THE ILLUMINOIDS by Neal Wilgus (Sun Press, Albuquerque, NM)
and ZEN WITHOUT ZEN MASTERS by Camden Benares (And/Or Press, Berkeley,
California). "We are operating on many levels here", as Ken Kesey used
to say.

     In conclusion, there is no conclusion. Things go on as they always
have, getting weirder all the time.

MAL-2: Sometimes I take humor seriously. Sometimes I take seriousness
humorously. Either way it is irrelevant.

GP: Maybe you are just crazy.
M2: Indeed! But do not reject these teaching as false because I am
crazy. The reason that I am crazy is because they are true.

M2: Everything is true.

M2: Even false things are true.

M2: There is a Zen Story about a student who asked a Master to explain
the
meaning of Buddhism. The Master's reply was "Three pounds of flax."
GP: Is that the answer to my question?
M2: No, of course not. That is just illustrative. The answer to your

The PENTABARF was discovered by the hermit Apostle Zarathud in the Fifth
Year of The Caterpillar. He found them carved in gilded stone, while
building a sun deck for his cave, but their import was lost for they
were written in a mysterious cypher. However, after 10 weeks & 11 hours
of intensive scrutiny he discerned that the message could be read by
standing on his head and viewing it upside down.

of Hindic Peoples (no meat of Beef), of Buddhists (no meat of animal),

A ZEN STORY

by Camden Benares, The Count of Five
Headmaster, Camp Meeker Cabal

A serious young man found the conflicts of mid 20th Century America
confusing.  He went to many people seeking a way of resolving within
himself the discords that troubled him, but he remained troubled.  One
night in a coffee house, a self-ordained Zen Master said to him, "go to
the dilapidated mansion you will find at this address which I have
written down for you. Do not speak to those who live there; you must
remain silent until the moon rises tomorrow night. Go to the large room
on the right of the main hallway, sit in the lotus position on top of
2916

the rubble in the northeast corner, face the corner, and meditate."

     He did just as the Zen Master instructed. His meditation was fre-
quently interrupted by worries. He worried whether or not the rest of
the plumbing fixtures would fall from the second floor bathroom to join
the pipes and other trash he was sitting on. He worried how would he
know when the moon rose on the next night. He worried about what the
people who walked through the room said about him.

     His worrying and meditation were disturbed when, as if in a test of
his faith, ordure fell from the second floor onto him. At that time two
people walked into the room. The first asked the second who the man
was sitting there was. The second replied "Some say he is a holy man.
Others say he is a shithead."

     Hearing this, the man was enlightened.

                   -  THE BIRTH OF THE ERISIAN MOVEMENT -
THE REVELATION

        Just prior to the decade of the nineteen-sixties, when Sputnik
was alone and new, and about the time that Ken Kesey took his first acid
trip as a medical volunteer; before underground newspapers, Viet Nam,
and talk of a second American Revolution; in the comparative quiet of
the late nineteen-fifties, just before the idea of RENAISSANCE became
relevant....

     Two young Californians, known later as Omar Ravenhurst and
Malaclypse the Younger, were indulging in their habit of sipping coffee
at an allnight bowling alley and generally solving the world's problems.
This particular evening the main subject of discussion was discord and
2917

they were complaining to each other of the personal confusion they felt
in their respective lives. "Solve the problem of discord," said one,
"and all other problems will vanish." "Indeed," said the other, "chaos
and strife are the roots of all confusion."


                         FIRST I MUST SPRINKLE YOU
                              WITH FAIRY DUST

Suddenly the place became devoid of light. Then an utter silence
enveloped them, and a great stillness was felt. Then came a blinding
flash of intense light, as though their very psyches had gone nova. Then
vision returned.

        The two were dazed and neither moved nor spoke for several
minutes.  They looked around and saw that the bowlers were frozen like
statues in a variety of comic positions, and that a bowling ball was
steadfastly anchored to the floor only inches from the pins that it had
been sent to scatter. The two looked at each other, totally unable to
account for the phenomenon. The condition was one of suspension, and one
noticed that the clock had stopped.


There walked into the room a chimpanzee, shaggy and grey about the
muzzle, yet upright to his full five feet, and poised with natural
majesty. He carried a scroll and walked to the young men.

"Gentlemen," he said, "why does Pickering's Moon go about in reverse
orbit?  Gentlemen, there are nipples on your chests; do you give milk?
And what, pray tell, Gentlemen, is to be done about Heisenberg's Law?"
He paused.  "SOMEBODY HAD TO PUT ALL OF THIS CONFUSION HERE!"

And with that he revealed his scroll. It was a diagram, like a yin-yang
with a pentagon on one side and an apple on the other. And then he
exploded and the two lost consciousness.

ERIS - GODDESS OF CHAOS, DISCORD & CONFUSION

        They awoke to the sound of pins clattering, and found the
bowlers engaged in their game and the waitress busy with making coffee.
It was apparant that their experience had been private.
        
        They discussed their strange encounter and reconstructed from
memory the chimpanzee's diagram. Over the next five days they searched
libraries to find the significance of it, but were disappointed to
uncover only references to Taoism, the Korean flag, and Technocracy. It
was not until they traced the Greek writing on the apple that they
discovered the ancient Goddess known to the Greeks as ERIS and to the
Romans as DISCORDIA. This was on the fifth night, and when they slept
that night each had a vivid dream of a splendid woman whose eyes were as
soft as feather and as deep as eternity itself, and whose body was the
spectacular dance of atoms and universes.  Pyrotechnics of pure energy
formed her flowing hair, and rainbows manifested and dissolved as she
spoke in a warm and gentle voice:

I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My conscious-
ness left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this
development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by 
2918

misunderstanding.  You have built for yourselves psychic suits of armor,
and clad in them, your vision is restricted, your movements are clumsy
and painful, your skin is bruised, and your spirit is broiled in the
sun.  I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and
scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and
clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you
that you are free.

     During the next months they studied philosophies and theologies,
and learned that ERIS or DISCORDIA was primarily feared by the ancients
as being disruptive. Indeed, the very concept of chaos was still
considered equivalent to strife and treated as a negative. "No wonder
things are all screwed up," they concluded, "they have got it all
backwards." They found that the principle of disorder was every much as
significant as the principle of order.

        With this in mind, they studied the strange yin-yang. During a
meditation one afternoon, a voice came to them:

It is called THE SACRED CHAO. I appoint you Keepers of It. Therein you
will find anything you like. Speak of Me as DISCORD, to show contrast to
the pentagon. Tell constricted mankind that there are no rules, unless
they choose to invent rules. Keep close the words of Syadasti: 'TIS AN
ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NO MINDS. And remember that there is no tyranny in
the State of Confusion. For further information, consult your pineal
gland.

        "What is this?" mumbled one to the other, "A religion based on
The Goddess of Confusion? It is utter madness!"

     And with those words, each looked at the other in absolute awe.
Omar began to giggle. Mal began to laugh. Omar began to jump up and
down. Mal was hooting and hollering to beat all hell. And amid squeals
of mirth and with tears on their cheeks, each appointed the other to be
high priest of his own madness, and together they declared themselves to
be a society of Discordia, for what ever that may turn out to be.


"There are trivial truths & there are great truths. The opposite of a
trivial truth is plainly false. The opposite of a great truth is also
true."

Mal-2 was once asked by one of his Disciples if he often prayed to Eris.

No, we Erisians seldom pray, it is much too dangerous. Charles Fort has
listed many factual incidences of ignorant people confronted with, say,
a drought, and then praying fervently -- and then getting the entire
village wiped out in a torrential flood.

                     What We Know About ERIS  (not much)

The Romans left a likeness of Her for posterity-- She was shown as a
grotesque woman with a pale and ghastly look, Her eyes afire, Her
garment ripped and torn, and women look pale and ghastly when concealing
a chilly dagger in their bosoms.

Her geneology is from the Greeks and is utterly confused. Either She was
the twin of Ares and the daughter of Zeus and Hera; or She was the
daughter of Nyx, goddess of night (who was either the daughter or wife
of Chaos, or both), and Nyx's brother, Erebus, and whose brothers and
sisters include Death, Doom, Mockery, and Friendship. And that She begat
Forgetfullness, Quarrels, Lies, and a bunch of gods and goddesses like
that.

One day Mal-2 consulted his Pineal Gland* and asked Eris if She really
created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always
liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic mat-
ters. "They were," She added, "victims of indigestion, you know."

Suffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But She is
mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.

        the Law of Fives is one of the oldest Erisian Mysterees. It was
first revealed to Good Lord Omar and is one of the great contributions
to come from The Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus.

     POEE subscribes to the Law of Fives of Omar's sect. And POEE also
recognizes the holy 23 (2+3=5) that is incorporated by Episkopos Dr.
Mordecai Malignatus, KNS, into his Discordian sect, The Ancient Il-
luminated Seers of Bavaria. 

     The Law of Fives states simply that: ALL THINGS HAPPEN IN FIVES, OR
ARE DIVISIBLE BY OR ARE MULTIPLES OF FIVE, OR ARE SOMEHOW DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY APPROPRIATE TO 5.

        The Law of Fives is never wrong.

     In the Erisian Archives is an old memo from Omar to Mal-2: "I find
the Law of Fives to be more and more manifest the harder I look."

"You will find that the State is the kind of ORGANIZATION which, though
it does big things badly, does small things badly too."

                      THE MYTH OF THE APPLE OF DISCORD
     It seems that Zeus was preparing a wedding banquet for Peleus and
Thetis and did not want to invite Eris because of Her reputation as a
trouble maker.*

     This made Eris angry, and so She fashioned an apple of pure gold**
and inscribed upon it KALLISTI ("To The Prettiest One") and on the day
of the fete She rolled it into the banquet hall and then left to be
alone and joyously partake of a hot dog.

     Now, three of the invited goddesses,*** Athena, Hera, and Aphro-
dite, each immediately claimed it to belong to herself because of the
inscription.  And they started fighting, and they started throwing punch
all over the place and everything.

     Finally Zeus calmed things down and declared that an arbitrator
must be selected, which was a reasonable suggestion, and all agreed. He
sent them to a shepherd of Troy, whose name was Paris because his mother
had had a lot of gaul and had married a Frenchman; but each of the
sneaky goddesses tried to outwit the others by going early and offering
a bribe to Paris.
        Athena offered him Heroic War Victories, Hera offered him Great
Wealth, and Aphrodite offered him the Most Beautiful Woman on Earth.
Being a healthy young Trojan lad, Paris promptly accepted Aphrodite's
bribe and she got the apple and he got screwed.
2923

     As she had promised, she maneuvered earthly happenings so that
Pariscould have Helen (The Helen) then living with her husband Mene-
laus,King of Sparta. Anyway, everyone knows that the Trojan War followed
when Sparta demanded their Queen back and that the Trojan War is said to
be The First War among men.

     And so we suffer because of the Original Snub. And so a Discordian
is to partake of No Hot Dog Buns.   Do you believe that?
-------------------------------------
* This is called THE DOCTRINE OF THE ORIGINAL SNUB
** There is historic disagreement concerning whether this apple was of
metalic gold or acapulco.
*** Actually there were five goddesses, but the Greeks did not know the
Law of Fives.

POEE (pronounced "POEE") is an acronym for The PARATHEO-ANAMETAMYSTIKHO-

MY HIGH REVERENCE MALACLYPSE THE YOUNGER, AB, DD, KSC, is the High
Priest of POEE, and POEE is grounded in his episkopotic revelations of

Gold].

The POEE HEAD TEMPLE is the Joshua Norton Cabal of The Discordian
Society, which is located in Mal-2's pineal gland and can be found by
temporally and spacially locating the rest of Mal-2.

POEE has no treasury, no by-laws, no articles, no guides save Mal-2's
pineal gland, and has only one scruple-- which Mal-2 keeps on his key
chain.

POEE has not registered,incorporated, or otherwise chartered with the
State, and so the State does not recognize POEE or POEE Ordinations,
which is only fair, because POEE does not recognize the State.

POEE has 5 DEGREES:
        There is the neophyte, or LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLE.

        And POEE =POPE=.

POEE LEGIONNAIRE DISCIPLES are authorized to initiate others as
Discordian Society Legionnaires. PRIESTS appoint their own DEACONS. The
POLYFATHER ordains priests. I don't know about the =POPES=.

POEE & It's Priests

If you like Erisianism as it is presented according to Mal-2, then you
may wish to form your own POEE CABAL as a POEE PRIEST and you can go do
a bunch of POEE Priestly Things. A "POEE Cabal" is exactly what you
think it is.

The High Priest makes no demands on his Priests, though he does rather
expect good will of them. The Office of The Polyfather is point, not to
teach. Once in a while, he even listens.

Should you find that your own revelations of The Goddess become
substantially different that the revelations of Mal-2, then perhaps the
Goddess has plans for you as an Episkopos, and you might consider
creating your own sect from scratch, unhindered. Episkoposes are not
competing with each other, and they are all POEE priests anyway (as soon
as I locate them). The point is that Episkoposes are developing separate
paths to the Erisian mountain top. See the section "Discordian Society"

ORDINATION AS A POEE PRIEST

There are no particular qualifications for Ordination because if you
want to be a POEE Priest then you must undoubtedly qualify. Who could
possibly know better than you whether or not you should be Ordained?

An ORDAINED POEE PRIEST or PRIESTESS is defined as "one who holds an
Ordination Certificate from the Office of the Polyfather."

the market place.

                          HOW TO START A POEE CABAL
                  WITHOUT MESSING AROUND WITH THE POLYFATHER

If you can't find the Polyfather, or having found him, don't want
anything to do with him, you are still authorized to form your own POEE
CABAL and do Priestly Things, using the Principia Discordia as a guide.
Your Official Rank will be POEE CHAPLIN for the LEGION OF DYNAMIC
DISCORD, which is exactly the same as a POEE PRIEST except that you
don't have an Ordination Certificate.  The words you are now reading are
your ordination.

HOW TO BECOME A POEE CHAPLIN

1. Write the ERISIAN AFFIRMATION in five copies.
2. Sign and nose-print each copy.
3. Send one to the President of the United States.
4. Send one to
        The California State Bureau of Furniture and Bedding
        1021 'D' Street, Sacramento CA 94814
5. Nail one to a telephone pole. Hide one. And burn the other.
Then consult your pineal gland.

                         = The POEE Baptismal Rite =
 This Mysteree Rite is not required for initiation, but it is offered by
many POEE Priests to proselytes who desire a formal ceremony.

1) The Priests and four Brothers are arranged in a pentagon with the
Initiate in the center facing the Priests. If possible, the Brothers on
the immediate right and left of the Priest should be Deacons. The
Initiate must be totally naked, to demonstrate that he is truly a human
being and not something else in disguise like a cabbage or something.

2) All persons in the audience and the pentagon, excepting the Priest,
assume a squatting position and return to a standing position. This is
repeated four more times. This dance is symbolic of the humility of we
Erisians.

3) The Priest begins:
   I, (complete Holy Name, with Mystical Titles, and degrees, designa-
tions, offices, &tc.), Ordained Priest of the Paratheo-anametamystikhood
of Eris Esoteric, with the Authority invested at me by the High Priest
of It, Office of the Polyfather, The House of the Rising Podge, POEE
Head Temple; Do herewith Require of Ye:

        1) ARE YE A HUMAN BEING AND NOT A CABBAGE OR SOMETHING? The
Initiate answers YES.
        2) THAT'S TOO BAD. DO YE WISH TO BETTER THYSELF? The Initiate
answers YES.
        3) HOW STUPID. ARE YE WILLING TO BECOME PHILOSOPHICALLY
ILLUMINIZED? He answers YES.
        4) VERY FUNNY. WILL YE DEDICATE YESELF TO THE HOLEY ERISIAN
MOVEMENT? The Initiate answers PROBABLY.
        5) THEN SWEAR YE THE FOLLOWING AFTER ME:
(The Priest here leads the Initiate in a recital of THE ERISIAN
AFFIRMATION.)
The Priest continues: THEN I DO HERE PROCLAIM YE POEE DISCIPLE (name),
LEGIONNAIRE OF THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD. HAIL ERIS! HAIL HAIL! HAIL
YES!

4) All present rejoice grandly. The new Brother opens a large jug of
wine and offers it to all who are present.

5) The Ceremony generally degenerates.


Mord says that Omar says that we are all unicorns anyway.

                                            DO NOT PULL ON YELLOW TIP

3. And though Omar did bid of the Collector of Garbage, in words that
were both sweet and bitter, to surrender back the cigar box containing
the cards designated by the Angel as The Honest Book of Truth, the
Collector was to him as one who might be smitten deaf, saying only:
'Gainst the rules, y' know.

                            THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY

The Discordian Society has no definition.

I sometimes think of it as a disorganization of Eris Freaks. It has been
called a guerrilla mind theatre. Episkopos Randomfactor, Director of
Purges of Our People's Underworld Movement sect in Larchmont, prefers
"The World's Greatest Association of What-ever-it-is-that-we-are." Lady
Mal thinks of it as a RENAISSANCE THINK TANK. Fang the Unwashed, WKC,
won't say. You can think of it any way you like.

AN EPISKOPOS OF THE DISCORDIAN SOCIETY
is one who prefers total autonomy, and creates his own Discordian sect
as The Goddess directs him. He speaks for himself and for those that say
that they like what he says.
2932

THE LEGION OF DYNAMIC DISCORD:
A Discordian Society Legionnaire is one who prefers not to create his
own sect. 

If you want in on the Discordian Society then declare yourself what you
wish do what you like and tell us about it or if you prefer don't.

There are no rules anywhere.            Some Episkoposes
The Goddess Prevails.                   have a one-man cabal.
                                        Some work together.
                                        Some never do explain.

                         THE PARABLE OF THE BITTER TEA
                                      by
                       Rev. Dr. Hypocrates Magoun, P.P.
                          POEE PRIEST, Okinawa Cabal

        When Hypoc was through meditating with St. Gulik, he went there
into the kitchen where he busied himself with preparing the feast and in
his endeavor, he found that there was some old tea in a pan left
standing from the night before, when he had in his weakness forgot about
its making and had let it sit steeping for 24 hours. It was dark and
murky and it was Hypoc's intention to use this old tea by diluting it
with water. And again in his weakness, chose without further considera-
tion and plunged into the physical labor of the preparations. It was
then when deeply immersed in the pleasure of that trip, he had a sudden
loud clear voice in his head saying "it is bitter tea that involves you
so." Hypoc heard the voice, but the struggle inside intensified, and the
pattern, previously established with the physical laboring and the
muscle messages coordinated and unified or perhaps coded, continued to
exert their influence and Hypoc succummed to the pressure and he denied
the voice. 
        And again he plunged into the physical orgy and completed the
task, and Lo as the voice had predicted, the tea was bitter.

                                "The Five Laws have root in awareness."
                                        --Che Fung (Ezra Pound, Canto
85)

The Hell Law says that Hell is reserved exclusively for them that
believe in it. Further, the lowest Rung in Hell is reserved for them
that believe in it on the supposition that they'll go there if they
don't.

A SERMON ON ETHICS AND LOVE

        One day Mal-2 asked the messenger spirit Saint Gulik to approach
the Goddess and request Her presence for some desperate advice. Shortly
afterwards the radio came on by itself, and an ethereal female Voice
said YES?
2936

        "O! Eris! Blessed Mother of Man! Queen of Chaos! Daughter of
Discord!  Concubine of Confusion! O! Exquisite Lady, I beseech You to
lift a heavy burden from my heart!"

        WHAT BOTHERS YOU, MAL? YOU DON'T SOUND WELL.

        "I am filled with fear and tormented with terrible visions of
pain.  Everywhere people are hurting one another, the planet is rampant
with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people,
mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war. O, woe."

        WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH THAT, IF IT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

        "But nobody Wants it! Everybody hates it."

        OH. WELL, THEN STOP.

                            CHAPTER 5: THE PIONEERS
                  =THE FIVE APOSTLES OF ERIS & WHO THEY BE =

1. HUNG MUNG
A Sage of Ancient China and Official Discordian Missionary to the
Heathen Chinee. He who originally devised THE SACRED CHAO. Patron of the
Season of Chaos. Holyday: Jan 5.

2. DR. VAN VAN MOJO
A Head Doctor of Deep Africa and Maker of Fine Dolls. D.H.V., Doctor of
Hoodoo and Vexes, from The Greater Metropolitan Yorba Linda Jesus Will
Save Your Bod Home Study Bible School; and F.I.H.G.W.P., Fellow of the
Intergalactic Haitian Guerrillas for World Peace. Patron of The Season
of Discord. Holyday: Mar 19.
[NOTE: Erisians of The Laughing Christ sect are of the silly contention
that Dr. Mojo is an imposter and that PATAMUNZO LINGANANDA is the True
Second Apostle. Lord Omar claims that Dr. Mojo heaps hatred upon
Patamunzo, who sends only Love Vibrations in return. But we of the POEE
sect know that Patamunzo is the Real Imposter, and that those vibrations
of his are actually an attempt to subvert Dr. Mojo's rightful apostilic
authority by shaking him out of his wits.

3. SRI SYADASTI SYADAVAKTAVYA SYADASTI SYANNASTI SYADASTI CAVAKTAVYASCA
SYADASTI SYANNASTI SYADAVATAVYASCA SYADASTI SYANNASTI SYADAVAKTAVYASCA

He is an Indian Pundit and Prince, born of the Peyotl Tribe, son of
Gentle Chief Sun Flower Seed and the squaw Merry Jane. Patron to
psychedelic type Discordians. Patron of the Season of Confusion.
Holyday: May 31. NOTE: Sri Syadasti should not be confused with BLESSED
ST. GULIK THE STONED, who is not the same person but is the same 
2937

Apostle.

4. ZARATHUD THE INCORRIGIBLE, sometimes called ZARATHUD THE STAUNCH
A hard nosed Hermit of Medieval Europe and Chaosphe Bible Banger. Dubbed
"Offender of The Faith." Discovered the Five Commandments. Patron of the
Season of Bureaucracy. Holyday: Aug. 12

A wandering Wiseman of Ancient Mediterrania ("Med-Terra" or middle
earth), who followed a 5-pointed Star through the alleys of Rome,

All statements are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless

                   being a BIBLE of The Erisian Movement

                         and How it was Revealed to
          Episkopos LORD OMAR KHAYYAM RAVENHURST, KSC; Bull Goose
        of Limbo; and Master Pastor of the Church Invisible of
        the Laughing Christ, Hidden Temple of The Happy Jesus,
                  Laughing Buddha Jesus [LBJ] Ranch


                    From the Honest Book of Truth
                 THE BOOK OF EXPLANATIONS, Chapter 1

1. There came one day to Lord Omar, Bull Goose of Limbo, a Messenger
of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Mound wherein was buried an
Honest Book.

2. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and dig the
Truth, that ye may come to know it and, knowing it, spread it and,
spreading it, wallow in it and, wallowing in it, lie in it and ,lying
in the Truth, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings -- an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

3. So Omar went forth to the Sacred Mound, which was to the East of
Mullah, and thereupon he worked digging in the sand for five days and
2938

five nights, but found no book.

4. At the end of five days and five nights of digging, it came to pass
that Omar was exhausted. So he put his shovel to one side and bedded
himself down on the sand, using as a pillow a Golden Chest he had
uncovered on the first day of his labors.

5. Omar slept.

6. On the fifth day of his sleeping, Lord Omar fell into a Trance, and
there came to him in the Trance a Dream, and there came to him in the
Dream a Messenger of Our Lady who told him of a Sacred Grove wherein
was hidden a Golden Chest.

7. And the Angel of Eris bade of the Lord: Go ye hence and lift the
Stash, that ye may come to own it and, owning it, share it and,
sharing it, love in it and, loving in it, dwell in it and, dwelling in
the Stash, become a Poet of the Word and a Sayer of Sayings - an
Inspiration to all men and a Scribe to the Gods.

8. But Omar lamented, saying unto the Angel: What is this shit,man?
What care I for the Word and Sayings? What care I for the Inspiration
of all men? Wherein does it profit a man to be a Scribe to the Gods
when the Scribes of the Governments do nothing, yet are paid better
wages?

9. And, lo, the Angel waxed in anger and Omar was stricken to the Ground

by an Invisible Hand and did not arise for five days and five nights.

10. And it came to pass that on the fifth night he dreampt, and in his
Dream he had a Vision, and in this Vision there came unto him a
Messenger of Our Lady who entrusted to him a Rigoletto cigar box
containing many filing cards, some of them in packs with rubber bands
around, and upon these cards were sometimes written verses, while upon
others nothing was written.

11. Thereupon the Angel Commanded to Lord: Take ye this Honest Book of
Truth to thine bosom and cherish it. Carry it forth into The Land and
Lay it before Kings of Nations and Collectors of Garbage. Preach from
it unto the Righteous, that they may renounce their ways and repent.

GREYFACE

In the year 1166 B.C., a malcontented hunchbrain by the name of
Greyface, got it into his head that the universe was as humorless as
he, and he began to teach that play was sinful because it contradicted
the ways of Serious Order. "Look at all the order around you," he
said. And from that, he deluded honest men to believe that reality was
a straightjacket affair and not the happy romance as men had known it.

It is not presently understood why men were so gullible at that
particular time, for absolutely no one thought to observe all the
disorder around them and conclude just the opposite. But anyway,
Greyface and his followers took the game of playing at life more
2939

seriously than they took life itself and were known even to destroy
other living beings whose ways of life differed from their own.

The unfortunate result of this is that mankind has since been
suffering from a psychological and spiritual imbalance. Imbalance causes
frustration, and frustration causes fear. And fear makes for a bad trip.
Man has been on a bad trip for a long time now.

It is called THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

                          THE BOOK OF UTERUS
                    from the Honest Book of Truth
                        revealed to Lord Omar

1. Before the beginning was the Nonexistent Chao, balanced in Oblivion
by the Perfect Counterpushpull of the Hodge and the Podge.

2. Whereupon, by an Act of Happenstance, the Hodge began gradually to
overpower the Podge -- and the Primal Chaos thereby came to be.

3. So in the beginning was the Primal Chaos, balanced on the Edge of
Oblivion by the Perfect Counterpullpush of the Podge and the Hodge.

4. Whereupon, by the Law of Negative Reversal,** the Podge swiftly
underpowered the Hodge and Everything broke loose.

5. And therein emerged the Active Force of Discord, the Subtle Manifes-
tation of the Nonexistent Chao, to guide Everything along the Path back
to Oblivion - that it might not become lost among Precepts of Order in
the Region of Thud.

6. Forasmuch as it was Active, the Force of Discord entered the State of
Confusion, wherein It copulated with the Queen and begat ERIS, Our Lady
of Discord and Gross Manifestation of the Nonexistent Chao.

7. And under Eris Confusion became established, and was hence called
Bureaucracy; while over Bureaucracy Eris became established, and was
2940

hence called Discordia.

8. By the by it came to pass that the Establishment of Bureaucracy
perished in a paper shortage.

9. Thus it was, in accord with the Law of Laws.

10. During and after the Fall of the Establishment of Bureaucracy was
the Aftermath, an Age of Disorder in which calculation, computations,
and reckonings were put away by the Children of Eris in Acceptance and
Preparation for the Return to Oblivion to be followed by a Repetition of
the Universal Absurdity. Moreover, of Itself the Coming of Aftermath
waseth a Resurrection of the Freedom-flowing Chaos. HAIL ERIS!

11. Herein was set into motion the Eristic Pattern, which would Repeat
Itself Five Times Over Seventy-three Times, after which nothing would
happen.

THE FIVE ORDERS OF DISCORDIA ("THEM")
Gen. Pandaemonium, Commanding

The seeds of the ORDERS OF DISCORDIA were planted by Greyface into his
early disciples. They form the skeleton of the Aneristic Movement, which
over emphasizes the Principle of Order and is antagonistic to the
necessary compliment, the Principle of Disorder. The Orders are composed
of persons all hung up on authority, security and control; i.e., they
are blinded by the Aneristic Illusion. They do not know that they belong
to Orders of Discordia.  But we know.

1. The Military Order of THE KNIGHTS OF THE FIVE SIDED TEMPLE. This is
for all the soldiers and bureaucrats of the world.

2. The Political Order of THE PARTY FOR WAR ON EVIL. This is reserved
for lawmakers, censors, and like ilk.

3. The Academic Order of THE HEMLOCK FELLOWSHIP. They commonly inhabit
schools and universities, and dominate many of them.

4. The Social Order of THE CITIZENS COMMITTEE FOR CONCERNED CITIZENS.
This is mostly a grass-roots version of the more professional military,
political, academic and sacred Orders.
2941

5. The Sacred Order of THE DEFAMATION LEAGUE. Not much is known about
the D.L., but they are very ancient and quite possibly were founded by
Greyface himself.  It is known that they now have absolute domination
over all organized churches in the world. It is also believed that they
have been costuming cabbages and passing them off as human beings.

A person belonging to one or more Order is just as likely to carry a
flag of the counter-establishment as the flag of the establishment--
just as long as it is a flag.


Don't let THEM immanentize the Eschaton.

THE FOLLOWING IS QUOTED FROM BERGAN EVANS
ON NORBERT WEINER, NUCLEAR PHYSICIST

        The second concept Wiener has to establish is that of entropy.
Probability is a mathematical concept, coming from statistics. Entropy
comes from physics. It is the assertion-- established logically and
experimentally-- that the universe, by its nature, is "running down",
moving toward a state of inert uniformity devoid of form, matter,
hierarchy or differentiation.

        That is, in any given situation, less organization, more chaos,
is overwhelmingly more probable than tighter organization or more order.

        The tendency for entropy to increase in isolated systems is
expressed in the second law of thermodynamics-- perhaps the most
pessimistic and amoral formulation in all human thought.

        It applies however, to a closed system, to something that is an
isolated whole, not just a part. Within such systems there may be parts,
which draw their energy from the whole, that are moving at least
temporarily, in the opposite direction; in them order is increasing and
chaos is diminishing.

        The whirlpools that swirl in a direction opposed to the main
current are called "enclaves". And one of them is life, especially human
life, which in a universe moving inexorably towards chaos moves towards
increased order.

                                   Personal
PLANETARY Pi, which I discovered, is 61. It's a Time-Energy relationship
existing between sun and inner plants and I use it in arriving at many
facts unknown to science. For example, multiply nude earth's circum-
ference 24,902.20656 by 61 and you get the distance of moon's orbit
around the earth.  This is slightly less than the actual distance
because we have not yet considered earth's atmosphere. So be it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           THE SACRED CHAO

THE SACRED CHAO is the key to illumination. Devised by the Apostle Hung
Mung in ancient China, it was modified and popularized by the Taoists
and is sometimes called the YIN-YANG. The Sacred Chao is not the
Yin-Yang of the Taoists. It is the HODGE-PODGE of the Erisians. And,
instead of a Podge spot on the Hodge side, it has a PENTAGON which
symbolizes the ANERISTIC PRINCIPLE, and instead of a Hodge spot on the
Podge side, it depicts the GOLDEN APPLE OF DISCORDIA to symbolize the
ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

The Sacred Chao symbolizes absolutely everything anyone need ever know
about absolutely anything, and more! It even symbolizes everything not
worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge.

HERE FOLLOWS SOME PSYCHO-METAPHYSICS.
If you are not hot for philosophy, best just to skip it.

        The Aneristic Principle is that of APPARENT ORDER; the Eristic
Principle is that of APPARENT DISORDER. Both order and disorder are man
made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a
level deeper that is the level of distinction making.

2943

        With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at
reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. The
ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened
people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially
other cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-
-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper
that is the level of concept.

        We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn
grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture
is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view
chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand
it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.

        Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting
one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a
perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say
unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we
Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. Some grids can be more useful than
others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others,
etc., but none can be more True than any other.

        DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some
particular grid. But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male,
like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of
female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysical-
ly arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC
PRINCIPLE.

        The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow
wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the
ERISTIC ILLUSION.

        The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition
relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T)
Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a
grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears
disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear dif-
ferently ordered and disordered. 
 
 Reality is the original Rorschach.

Verily! So much for all that.

The words of the Foolish and those of the Wise
Are not far apart in Discordian Eyes.
(HBT; The Book of Advise, 2:1)

The PODGE of the Sacred Chao is symbolized as The Golden Apple of
Discordia, which represents the Eristic Principle of Disorder. The
writing on it, "KALLISTI" is Greek for "TO THE PRETTIEST ONE" and refers
to an old myth about The Goddess. But the Greeks had only a limited
understanding of Disorder, and thought it to be a negative principle.

The Pentagon represents the Aneristic Principle of Order and symbolizes
the HODGE. The Pentagon has several references; for one,, it can be
taken to represent geometry, one of the earliest studies of formal order
to reach elaborate development;* for another, it specifically accords
2944

with THE LAW OF FIVES. 

THE TRUTH IS FIVE BUT MEN HAVE ONLY ONE NAME FOR IT.
                                -Patamunzo Lingananda

It is also the shape of the United States Military Headquarters, the
Pentagon Building, a most pregnant manifestation of straightjacket order
resting on a firm foundation of chaos and constantly erupting into
dazzling disorder; and this building is one of our more cherished
Erisian Shrines. Also it so happens that in times of medieval magic, the
pentagon was the generic symbol for werewolves, but this reference is
not particularly intended and it should be noted that the Erisian
Movement does not discriminate against werewolves-- our membership
roster is open to persons of all races, national origins and
hobbies.

                               BRUNSWICK SHRINE

In the Los Angeles suburb of Whittier there lives a bowling alley, and
within this very place, in the Year of Our Lady of Discord 3125 (1959*),
Eris revealed Herself to The Golden Apple Corps for the first time.

In honor of this Incredible Event, this Holy Place is revered as a
Shrine by all Erisians. Once every five years, the Golden Apple Corps
plans a Pilgrimage to Brunswick Shrine as an act of Devotion, and
therein to partake of No Hot Dog Buns, and ruminate a bit about It All.

It is written that when The Corps returns to The Shrine for the fifth
time five times over, than shall the world come to an end:

                                IMPENDING DOOM
                                  HAS ARRIVED
        And Five Days Prior to This Occasion The Apostle The Elder
        Malaclypse Shall Walk the Streets of Whittier Bearing a Sign
        for All Literates to Read thereof: "DOOM", as a Warning of
        Forthcoming Doom to All Men Impending. And He Shall Signal 
        This Event by Seeking the Poor and Distributing to Them Precious
        MAO BUTTONS and Whittier Shall be Known as The Region of Thud
        for These Five Days.

As a public service to all mankind and civilization in general, and to
us in particular, the Golden Apple Corps has concluded that planning
such a Pilgrimage is sufficient and that it is prudent to never get
around to actually going.

Brother Ram,

Your acute observation that ERIS spelled backwards is SIRE, and your
inference to the effect that there is sexual symbolism here, have
brought me to some observations of my own,

ERIS spelled fore-part-aft-wards is RISE. And spelled inside out is
REIS, which is a unit of money, albeit Portugese-Brazilian and no longer
in use.  >From this it may be concluded that Eris has usurped Eros (god
of erotic love) in the eyes of those who read backwards; which obviously
made Eros sorE. Then She apparently embezzeled the Olympian Treasury and
went to Brazil; whereupon She opened a chain of whorehouses (which
certainly would get a rise from the male population). I figure it to be
this in particular because MADAM reads the same forwards and backwards.
And further, it is a term of great respect, similar to SIRE.

And so thank you for your insight, it may well be the clue to the
mystery of just where Eris has been fucking around for 3125.

NON-BEING, named ANERIS. (To this day, the fundamental truth that Aneris
is the larger is apparent to all who compare the great number of things
that do not exist with the comparatively small number of things that do
exist.)

        Eris had been born pregnant, and after 55 years (Goddesses have
an unusually long gestation period-- longer even than elephants), Her
pregnancy bore the fruits of many things. These things were composed of
the Five Basic Elements, SWEET, BOOM, PUNGENT, PRICKLE, and ORANGE.
Aneris, however, had been created sterile. When she saw Eris enjoying
Herself so greatly with all of the existent things She had borne, Aneris
became jealous and finally one day she stole some existent things and
changed them into non-existent things and claimed them as her own
children. This deeply hurt Eris, who felt that Her sister was unjust
(being so much larger anyway) to deny Her her small joy. And so She made
herself swell again to bear more things. And She swore that no matter
how many of her begotten that Aneris would steal, She would beget more.
And, in return, Aneris swore that no matter how many existent things
Eris brought forth, she would eventually find them and turn them into
non-existent things for her own. (And to this day, things appear and
disappear in this very manner.) 

        At first, the things brought forth by Eris were in a state of
chaos and went in every which way, but by the by She began playing with
them andordered some of them just to see what would happen. Some pretty
things arosefrom this play and for the next five zillion years She
amused Herself bycreating order. And so She grouped some things with
others and some groups with others, and big groups with little groups,
and all combinations until She had many grand schemes which delighted
Her.

        Engrossed in establishing order, She finally one day noticed
disorder (previously not apparent because everything was chaos). There
were many ways in which chaos was ordered and many ways in which it was
not.

        "Hah," She thought, "Here shall be a new game."

        And She taught order and disorder to play with each other in
contest games, and to take turns amusing each other. She named the side
of disorder after Herself, "ERISTIC" because Being is anarchic. And
then, in a mood of sympathy for Her lonely sister, She named the other
side "ANERISTIC" which flattered Aneris and smoothed the friction a
little that was between them. 

        Now all of this time, Void was somewhat disturbed. He felt
unsatisfied for he had created only physical existence and physical
non-existence, and had neglected the spiritual. As he contemplated this,
a great Quiet was caused and he went into a state of Deep Sleep which
lasted for 5 eras. At the end of this ordeal, he begat a brother to Eris
and Aneris, that of SPIRITUALITY, who had no name at all.

2948

        When the sisters heard this, they both confronted Void and
pleaded that he not forget them, his First Born. And so Void decreed
thus:

        That this brother, having no form, was to reside with Aneris in
Non-Being and then to leave her and, so that he might play with order
and disorder, reside with Eris in Being. But Eris became filled with
sorrow when She heard this and then began to weep.

        "Why are you despondent?" demanded Void, "Your new brother will
have his share with you." "But Father, Aneris and I have been arguing,
and she will take him from me when she discovers him, and cause him to
return to Non-Being." "I see,"replied Void, "Then I decree the follow-
ing:

        "When your brother leaves the residence of Being, he shall not
reside again in Non-Being, but shall return to Me, Void, from whence he
came. You girls may bicker as you wish, but My son is your Brother and
We are all of Myself." 

And so it is that we, as men, do not exist until we do; and then it is
that we play with our world of existent things, and order and disorder
them, and so it shall be that non-existence shall take us back from
existence and that nameless spirituality shall return to Void, like a
tired child home from a very wild circus.

Unlike a song, chants are not sung but chanted. This particular one is
much enhanced by the use of a Leader to chant the Sanskrit alone, with
all participants chanting the English. it also behooves one to be in a
quiet frame of mind and to be sitting in a still position, perhaps The
Buttercup Position. It also helps if one is absolutely zonked out of his
gourd.

The Classification of Saints

1. SAINT SECOND CLASS

To be reserved for all human beings deserving of Sainthood. Example:
St.Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of
Mexico (his grave near San Francisco is an official POEE shrine.)

THE FOLLOWING FOUR CATAGORIES ARE RESERVED FOR FICTIONAL BEINGS WHO, NOT
BEING ACTUAL, ARE MORE CAPABLE OF PERFECTION.

2. LANCE SAINT

Good Saint material and definitely inspiring.
Example: St. Yossarian (Catch 22, Heller)

3. LIEUTENANT SAINT

Excellent Goddess-Saturated Saint.
Example: St. Quixote (Don Quixote, Cervantes)

4. BRIGADIER SAINT

Comparable to Lt/Saint but has an established following (fictional or
factual). Example: St. Bokonon (Cat's Cradle, Vonnegut)

5. FIVE STAR SAINT

The Five Apostles of Eris.

Note: It is an Old Erisian Tradition to never agree with each other
about Saints.


Everybody understands Mickey Mouse. Few understand Herman Hesse. Only a
hand full understood Albert Einstein. And nobody understood Emperor
Norton.

TESTS BY DOCTORS PROVE IT POSSIBLE TO SHRINK

    =ON OCCULTISM=

Magicians, especially since the Gnostic and the Quabala influences, have
sought higher consciousness through assimilation and control of
universal opposites-- good/evil, positive/negative, male/female, etc.
But due to the steadfast pomposity of ritualism inherited from the
ancient methods of the shaman, occultists have been blinded to what is
perhaps the two most important pairs of apparent or earth-plane
opposites: ORDER/DISORDER and SERIOUS/HUMOROUS.

Magicians, and progeny the scientists, have always taken themselves and
their subject in an orderly and sober manner, thereby disregarding an
2950

essential metaphysical balance. when magicians learn to approach
philosophy as a malleable art instead of an immutable Truth, and learn
to appreciate the absurdity of man's endeavours, then they will be able
to pursue their art with a lighter heart, and perhaps gain a clearer
understanding of it, and therefore gain more effective magic. CHAOS IS
ENERGY.

This is an essential challenge to the basic concepts of all western
occult thought, and POEE is humbly pleased to offer the first break-
through in occultism since Solomon.

POEE ASTROLOGICAL SYSTEM

1) Om your next birthday, return to the place of your birth and, at
precisely midnight, noting your birth time and date of observation,
count all visible stars.

2) When you have done this, write to me and I'll tell you what to do
next.


The Eminent 16th Century Mathemetician Cardan so detested Luther that he
altered Luther's birthdate to give him an unfavorable horoscope.

The theorem to be proved is that if any even number of people take seats
at random around a circular table bearing place cards with their names,
it is always possible to rotate the table until at least two people are
opposite their cards. Assume the contrary. Let N be the even number of
persons, and let their names be replaced by the integers 0 to N-1 "in
such a way that the place cards are numbered in sequence around the
table. If a delegate D originally sits down to a place card P, then the
table must be rotated R steps before he is correctly seated, where
R=P-D, unless this is negative, in which case R=P-D+N. The collection of
values of D (and of P) for all delegates is clearly the integers 0 to
N-1,each taken once, but so also is the collection of values of R, or
else two delegates would be correctly seated at the same time.  Summing
the above equations, one for each delegate, gives S-S+NK, where K is an
integer and S=N(N-1)/2, the sum of the integers from 0 to N-1. It
follows that N=2K+1, an odd number." This contradicts the original
assumption.
        "I actually solved this problem some years ago," Rybicki writes,
"for a different but completely equivalent problem, a generalization of
the nonattacking 'eight queens' problem for a cylindrical chessboard
where diagonal attack is restricted to diagonals slanting in one
direction only.

                        THE CURSE OF GREYFACE AND THE
                          INTRODUCTION OF NEGATIVISM

        To choose order over disorder, or disorder over order, is to
accept a trip composed of both the creative and the destructive. But to
choose the creative over the destructive is an all-creative trip
composed of both order and disorder. To accomplish this, one need only
2951

accept creative disorder along with, and equal to, creative order, and
also willing to reject destructive order as an undesirable equal to
destructive disorder.

        The Curse of Greyface included the division of life into
order/disorder as the essential positive/negative polarity, instead of
building a game foundation with creative/destructive as the essential
positive/negative. He has thereby caused man to endure the destructive
aspects of order and has prevented man from effectively participating in
the creative uses of disorder. Civilization reflects this unfortunate
division.

        POEE proclaims that the other division is preferable, and we
work toward the proposition that creative disorder, like creative order,
is possible and desirable; and that destructive order, like destructive
disorder, is unnecessary and undesirable.

        Seek the Sacred Chao - therein you will find the foolishness of
all ORDER/DISORDER. They are the same!

                   ERISIAN MAGIC RITUAL - THE TURKEY CURSE

Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the
evil Curse of Greyface, THE TURKEY CURSE is here passed on to Erisians
everywhere for their just protection.

The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that Greyface
and his followers absolutely require an aneristic setting to function
and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize
their foundation.  The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract
negative aneristic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or positive
aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will prove
harmless, or at worst, simply annoying. It is not designed for use
against negative eristic vibes, although it can be used as an eristic
vehicle to introduce positive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In
this instance, it would be the responsibility of the Erisian Magician to
manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved.
CAUTION- all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on the
part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire. Positive
motivation is essential for self-protection.

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE:

Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for fis-
ticuffs.  Face the particular greyfaced you wish to short-circuit, or
towards the direction of the negative aneristic vibration that you wish
to neutralize.  Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make
motions with your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy
giantess. Chant, loudly and clearly:
                   GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!
The results will be instantly apparent.

                A PRIMER FOR ERISIAN EVANGELISTS by Lord Omar

        The SOCRATIC APPROACH is most successful when confronting the
ignorant. The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument
by asking questions. You approach the innocent and simply ask "Did you
know that God's name is ERIS, and that He is a girl?" If he should
answer "Yes." then he probably is a fellow Erisian and so you can forget
it. If he says "No." then quickly proceed to:
        THE BLIND ASSERTION and say "Well, He Is a girl, and His name is
ERIS!" Shrewedly observe if the subject is convinced. If he is, swear
him into the Legion of Dynamic Discord before he changes his mind. If he
does not appear convinced, then proceed to:
        THE FAITH BIT: "But you must have Faith! All is lost without
Faith! I sure feel sorry for you if you don't have Faith." And then add:
        THE ARGUMENT BY FEAR and in an ominous voice ask "Do you know
what happens to those who deny Goddess?" If he hesitates, don't tell him
that he will surely be reincarnated as a precious Mao Button and
distributed to the poor in the Region of Thud (which would be a mean
thing to say), just shake your head sadly and, while wiping a tear from
your eye, go to:
        THE FIRST CLAUSE PLOY wherein you point to all of the discord
and confusion in the world and exclaim "Well who the hell do you think
did all of this, wise guy?" If he says, "Nobody, just impersonal
forces." then quickly respond with:
        THE ARGUMENT BY SEMANTICAL GYMNASTICS and say that he is
absolutely right, and that those impersonal forces are female and that
Her name is ERIS.  If he, wonder of wonders, still remains obstinate,
then finally resort to:
        THE FIGURATIVE SYMBOLISM DODGE and confide that sophisticated
people like himself recognize that Eris is a Figurative Symbol for an
Ineffable Metaphysical Reality and that The Erisian Movement is really
more like a poem than like a science and that he is liable to be turned
into a Precious Mao Button and Distributed to The Poor in The Region of
Thud if he does not get hip. Then put him on your mailing list.

SINK

A GAME

by Ala Hera, E.L., N.S.; RAYVILLE APPLE PANTHERS

SINK is played by Discordians and people of much ilk.

PURPOSE: To sink object or an object or a thing...
in water or mud or anything you; can sink something in.

RULES: Sinking is allowd in any manner. To date, ten pound chunks of mud
were used to sink a tobacco can. It is preferable to have a pit of water
or a hole to drop things in. But rivers - bays - gulfs - I dare say even
oceans can be used. 

TURNS are taken thusly: who somever gets the junk up and in the air
first.

DUTY: It shall be the duty of all persons playing "SINK" to help find
more objects to sink, once; one object is sunk.

2953

UPON SINKING: The sinked shall yell "I sank it!" or something equally as
thoughtful.

NAMING OF OBJECTS is some times desirable. The object is named by the
finder of such object and whoever sinks it can say for instance, "I sunk
Columbus, Ohio!"

In the meantime - plant your seeds.

If a lot of people who receive this letter plant a few seeds and a lot
of people receive this letter, then a lot of seeds will get planted.
Plant your seeds.

In parks. On lots. Public flower beds. In remote places. At City Hall.
Wherever. Whenever. Or start a plantation in your closet (but read up on
it first for that). For casual planting, its best to soak them in water
for a day and plant in a bunch of about 5, about half an inch deep.
Don't worry much about the weather, they know when the weather is wrong
and will try to wait for nature. Don't soak them if its wintertime.
Seeds are a very hearty life form and strongly desire to grow and
flourish. But some of them need people's help to get started. Plant your
seeds.

Make a few copies of this letter (5 would be nice) and send them to
friends of yours. Try to mail to different cities and states, even
different countries.  If you would rather not, then please pass this
copy on to someone and perhaps they would like to.

THERE IS NO TRUTH to the legend that if you throw away a chain letter
then all sorts of catastrophic, abominable, and outrageous disasters
will happen. Except, of course, from your seed's point of view.

        Dear Brother Mal-2,

        In response to your request for unclassified agitprop to be inserted
in the new edition of PRINCIPIA, hope the following will be of use. And
please
stop bothering us with your incessant letters!

        Episkopos Mordecai, Keeper of the Notary Sojac, informs me that you
are welcome to reveal that our oldest extant records show us to have been
fully established in Atlantis, circa 18,000 B.C., under Kull, the galley
slave who ascended to the Throne of Valusia. Revived by Pelias of Koth, circa
10,000 B.C. Possibly it was he who taught the inner-teachings to Conan of
Cimmeria after Conan became King of Aquilonia. First brought to the western
hemisphere by Conan and taught to Mayan priesthood (Conan is Quetzlcoatl).
That was 4 Ahua, 8 Cumhu, Mayan date. Revived by Abdul Alhazred in his
infamous Al Azif, circa 800 A.D. (Al Azif translated into Latin by Olaus 
2957

Wormius, 1132 A.D., as The Necronomicon.) In 1090 A.D. was the founding of
The Ismaelian Sect (Hashishim) by Hassan i Sabbah, with secret teachings
based on Alhazred, Pelias and Kull. Founding of the Illuminated Ones of
Bavaria, by Adam Weishaupt, on May 1, 1776. He based it on the others.
Weishaupt brought it to the United States during the period that he was
impersonating George Washington; and it was he who was the Man in Black who
gave the design for The Great Seal to Jefferson in the garden that night. The
Illuminated tradition is now, of course, in the hands of The Ancient
Illuminated Seers of Bavaria (A.I.S.B.), headquartered here in the United
States.

        Our teachings are not, need I remind you, available for publication.
No harm, though, in admitting that some of them can be found disguised in
Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, Burroughs Nova Express, the King James translation
of the Holy Bible (though not the Latin or Hebrew), and The Blue Book. Not to
speak of Ben Franklin's private papers (!), but we are still suppressing
those.

        Considering current developments--you know the ones I speak of--it
has been decided to reveal a few more of our front organizations. Your
publication is timely, so mention that in addition to the old fronts like the
Masons, the Rothchild Banks, and the Federal Reserve System, we now have
significant control of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (since Hoover died
last year, but that is still secret), the Students for a Democratic Society,
the Communist Party USA, the American Anarchist Assn., the Junior Chamber of
Commerce, the Black Lotus Society, the Republican Party, the John Dillinger
Die For You Society, and the Camp Fire Girls. It is still useful to continue
the sham of the Birchers that we are seeking world domination; so do not
reveal that political and economic control was generally complete several
generations ago and that we are just playing with the world for a while until
civilization advances sufficiently for phase five.

        In fact you might still push Vennard's The Federal Reserve Hoax:
"Since the Babylonian Captivity there has existed a determined,
behind-the-scenes under-the-table, atheistic, satanic, anti-Christian
force--worshipers of Mamon--whose undying purpose is world control through
the control of Money. July 1, 1776 (correct that to May 1st, Vennard can't
get anything right) the Serpent raised its head in the under-ground secret
society known as the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt. There is con-
siderable documentary evidence to prove all revolutions, wars, depressions,
strikes and chaos stem from this source." Etc., etc., you know the stuff.

        The general location of our US HQ, incidentally, has been nearly
exposed; and so we will be moving for the first time this century (what a
drag!). If you want, you can reveal that it is located deep in the labyrinth
of sewers beneath Dealy Plaza in Dallas, and is presided over by The Dealy
Lama. Inclosed are some plans for several new potential locations. Please
review and add any comments you feel pertinent, especially regarding the
Eristic propensity of the Pentagon site.

        Oh, and we have some good news for you, Brother Mal! You know that
Zambian cybernetics genius who joined us? Well, he has secretly co-ordinated
the FBI computers with the Zurich System and our theoriticians are in ecstasy
over the new information coming out. Look, if you people out there can keep
from blowing yourselves up for only two more generations, then we will
finally
have it. After 20,000 years, Kull's dream will be realized! We can hardly
believe it. But the outcome is certain, given the time. Our grandchildren,
2958

Mal! If civilization makes it through this crises, our grandchildren will
live in a world of authentic freedom and authentic harmony and authentic
satisfaction. I hope I'm alive to see it, Mal, success is in our grasp.
Twenty thousand years....!

        Ah, I get spaced just thinking about it. Good luck on the Principia.

Part Five     The Golden Secret


NONSENSE AS SALVATION

The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it ceases
taking itself so seriously.

To that end, POEE proposes the countergame of NONSENSE AS SALVATION.
Salvation from an ugly and barbarous existence that is the result of taking
order so seriously and so seriously fearing contrary orders and disorder,
that GAMES are taken as more important than LIFE; rather than taking LIFE AS
THE ART OF PLAYING GAMES.

To this end, we propose that man develop his innate love for disorder, and
play with The Goddess Eris. And know that it is a joyful play, and that
thereby CAN BE REVOKED THE CURSE OF GREYFACE.

If you can master nonsense as well as you have already learned to master
sense, then each will expose the other for what it is: absurdity. From that
moment of illumination, a man begins to be free regardless of his
surroundings. He becomes free to play order games and change them at will. He
becomes free to play disorder games just for the hell of it. He becomes free
to play neither or both. And as the master of his own games, he plays without
fear, and therefore without frustration, and therefore with good will in his
soul and love in his being.

And when men become free then mankind will be free.
May you be free of The Curse of Greyface.
May the Goddess put twinkles in your eyes.
May you have the knowledge of a sage,
    and the wisdom of a child.
Hail Eris.

THE LAST WORD
The foregoing document was revealed to Mal-2 by the Goddess Herself through
many consultations with Her within his Pineal Gland. It is guaranteed to be
the Word of Goddess. However, it is only fair to state that Goddess doesn't
always say the same thing to each listener, and that other Episkoposes are
sometimes told quite different things in their Revelations, which are also
the Word of Goddess. Consequently, if you prefer a Discordian Sect other than
POEE, then none of these Truths are binding, and it is a rotten shame that
you have read all the way down to the very last word.

                         INTERVIEW WITH NORTON CABAL
                   by Gypsie Skripto, Special Correspondent

        It has been ten years since I net the mysterious Malaclypse the
Younger. I was free lancing for the underground papers and went to POEE Hear
Temple at 555 Battery Street to try for an interview.

        I found him in the Temple PO Box busy wrapping up the new Fourth
Edition of PRINCIPIA. He seemed impatient with me, insisting that he didn't
have the time or inclination for foolish questions from reporters. Undaunted,
I burst out with questions like whether he preferred Panama Red or Acapulco

Gold and how the fuck did we manage to fit inside of a tiny post office box
and other things apropos a naive young semiliterate dropout hippy writer. He
asked me if I wanted to drop mescaline and fuck all night and said he knew
how to turn himself into a unicorn and there might be room for a tiny
interview on the cover of the PRINCIPIA if I wanted to work for the GREATER
POOP so I said sure, OK, I've never dropped mescaline in a post office box
before.

        It turned out I was among the last to see Malaclypse. As subsequent
issues of GREATER POOP revealed, he was to disappear and POEE business was to
be assumed by his students at Norton Cabal. Professor Ignotum P. Ignotius,
Department of Comparative Realities, was assigned the Trust of the POEE
Scruple and Rev. Dr. Occupant became Keeper of the Box. The newly published
copies of PRINCIPIA were distributed by Mad Malik, Block Disorganizer, who
had distribution contacts with the Aluminum Bavariati. Practical relations
remained in the hands of concept artist G. Hill.

 When the 1000 PRINCIPIAS were gone the GREATER POOP stopped
publishing, Head Temple closed down and the Cabal just seemed to evaporate.
Finally even the box was closed. But over the years I noticed that copies
were still circulating, and that independent Discordian Cabal would oc-
casionally pop out of nowhere (and still do ). And I would wonder what ever
happened to Malaclypse.

 When I read the ILLUMINATUS trilogy I resolved to again find and
interview the denizens of Joshua Norton Cabal of the Discordian Society.

        * * *

 As I cabled over Nob to San Francisco's Station 'O' Post Office I
couldn't help but wonder at Goddess' hand in assigning street addresses to
Her outposts. Mal2 had told me that Good Lord Omar always filed everything
under "O" for OUT OF FILE.

        "Maya is marvelous" I was thinking when I rapped on the little metal
door and was greeted warmly by a huge beard who introduced himself as
Professor Ignotius. He ushered me into a spacious wood paneled and tapestry
hung parlor where three others were laughing and passing around a wine jug.
The sunny one in a tunic was the Reverend Doctor Occupant, the trim khaki and
jeans was Mad Malik and the wine jug claimed to be Hill. I got the recorder
on....

GYPSIE SKRIPTO [in response to a question]: ...1969 but only briefly. I guess
I missed you guys.

MAD MALIK: No wonder, he was pretty much a one man show then. We were just
2962

his students and were usually off on errands. You worked for the POOP?

Gypsie: Well, for one night anyway. The interview is in the PRINCIPIA.

REV. DR. OCCUPANT: Malik was the only one he would ever let write for the
POOP or get on the letterhead.

Gypsie: Did you [Malik] have higher authority than the others?

Malik: No, [but I was allowed to speak in the POOP] because [Malaclypse the
Younger] hated politics. He was infuriated with Johnson and nixon over Viet
Nam because it was turning the renaissance into a political revolution and
was stealing his sacred thunder. So he trained me in Zenarchy, which he
learned from Omar, and I was the official anarcho-pacifist for the Cabal.
Also I was liaison to The Ancient Illuminated Seers of Bavaria, the Chicago
Discordians.  Later Omar activated the Hung Mung Cong Tong and ELF, on
zenarchist principles, and also Operation Mindfuck. I was also into those.
Though at the time I was masquerading in GREATER POOP as a created cabbage to
throw off the FBI.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Since you wrote it, I take it you are an anarchist?

G.H. Hill: Since then I have given up anarchy. Too many rules-- hating the
government and all that stuff.

IGNOTUM PER IGNOTIUS: It's like hating your own fantasies.

Malik: [Anarchy] is also standing up and proceeding forward, fantasy rule or
not. The condition is the same.

Occupant: Brother needs some wine!

Malik: We have had this argument before, Reverend Doctor Brother. But wine
before platitudes, fill it up.

Gypsie [to Hill]: And pacifism?

Hill: I'm not sure I ever was one. Mal2 was not, Malik was. Personally I
accepted self defense yet I could never reconcile that with the ideal. I
finally gave up on that one too. Actually I just gave up on idealism.

Ignotius: Idealism lives with rules. Realism lives with rocks.

Hill: Yeah. I get along better with rocks.

Malik: Mal2 once told me that pacifism was a dilemma. If everybody was a
pacifist then everything would be perfect. But nobody is going to be a
pacifist unless I am first. But if I am and somebody else is not, then I get
screwed. He said that there were five choices under that circumstance. The
first was napalming farmers and the second was executing your parents. The
third was hypocrisy, the fourth was cowardice, and the fifth was to swallow
the dilemma. Zenarchists are trained in dilemma swallowing.

Occupant: So are other Erisians, like POEE.

Ignotius: That is characteristic of the Discordian perspective.

Hill: But of course training contradicts Discordian principles.
2963

Malik: Oh so what. Contradictions are nothing to Discordians.

Occupant: Dilemma, Schilmemma. [to Gypsie]: What do you think of this, pretty
ma'am? We don't get to hear your thoughts.

Gypsie: I'm reporting now, you talk.

Occupant: Later then?

Gypsie: Perhaps. Later.

Occupant: You are smiling.

Gypsie: Hey, guy, later. [to Hill]: Doesn't this leave you a little schizy?

Hill: It's OK, I'm half Gemini.

Gypsie: What's the other half?

Hill: Taurus. That makes me a stubborn schizy.

Ignotius: I'm a Whale.

Occupant: I choose Satyr.

Malik: Spirits don't have signs.

Hill: A character can have a sign if I want it so.

Occupant: Well I can have a sign if I want to and screw both of you.

Malik: Come on Greg, you just think that we are your characters....

Occupant: You were inhabited by Malaclypse the Younger. He caused you to
create roles and those roles are being performed by us spirits.

Ignotius: A perfectly normal pagan relationship.

Hill: Well you can look at it like that if you want to, but I created Mal2 to
my specifications just as I conceived all the rest of you.

Occupant: You didn't invent Eris. She caused you to think you created the
spirit of Malaclypse.

Hill: Oh bull! Besides, I changed her so much the Greeks would never
recognize her.

Occupant: That's what She wanted!

Ignotius: Deities change things around all the time.

Malik: What you don't realize is that a spirit has a self identity.

Hill: Nope. A spirit is a product of definition and the one who is doing the
defining around here is me. Your identity is what I say it is. Just to prove
it, I'm going to change your name.

SINISTER DEXTER: It's OK with me. Fate is fate. I never much liked "Mad 
2964

Malik" anyway.

Ignotius: Besides people confused him with Joe Malik in ILLUMINATUS.

Dexter: I sort of enjoyed the confusion part.

Occupant: Doesn't prove anything anyway.

Gypsie: That name sounds familiar. Where is it from?

Hill: Its a name I came up with in the old days and never used it much. Its
on page 38 of the PRINCIPIA referring to Vice President Spiro Agnew. I always
thought I invented it but now it sounds like a Stan Freberg name now that I
think about it. It may have stuck in my preconscious memory from early TV.

Gypsie: Can you use it without his permission?

Hill: If it is his? I don't know. I hope so. it means "left right" in Latin
and is a perfect name for a libertarian anarchist. Actually in my kind of art
the question of what can I use freely and what can I not is a very tricky
problem.

Gypsie: How do you mean?

Hill: Well, take a collage for example. Like the early one on page 36 of the
PRINCIPIA. Each little piece was extracted from some larger work created by
some other artist and published and maybe copyrighted. I find them in
newspapers and magazines mostly. Often from ads. With a collage you select
and extract from your environment and then assemble into an original
relationship.

The PRINCIPIA itself is a collage. A conceptual collage. All of it happens
simultaneously. But visually it is a montage, passing through time, like a
book does.

There is a lot of pirated stuff in the PRINCIPIA, especially in the margins.
But also I sympathize with artists who must own and sell their works to earn
a living. Art, like knowledge, should be free fodder for everyone. But it
isn't It is perplexing.

Gypsie: Where did all the things in PRINCIPIA come from?

Hill: Well, a full answer would take another book in itself. Most of the
writing credited to a name is a true person and almost always a different
name means a different person. Most of the non-credited, you know, Malaclyps-
e, text is mine although some things credited to either Mal2 or Omar were
actually co-written and passed back and forth and rewritten by each of us.
The marginalia, dingbats, and pasted in titles and heads and things came from
wherever I found them--some of which is original but uncredited Discordian
output, like the page head on 12 and other pages which is from a series of
satiric memo pads from Our Peoples Underworld Cabal. All page layout is mine
and some whole graphics like the Sacred Chao and the Hodge Podge Transformer
are mine but mostly I just found stuff and integrated it. Mostly I did
concept, say 50% of the writing, 10% of the graphics, all of the layout.

Gypsie: Specifically, what are some of the sources?

Hill: Weel, the poem on the front cover is by Walt Kelly and was spoken by
2965

one of his characters in Pogo. The government seals starting from page 1 are
from a book of sample seals from the U.S. Government Printing Office. Western
Union on page 6 got into the act because I used to be a teletype operator and
had access to blank forms. Rubber stamps came from all over the place and
some, like the apple on page 27, I carved myself. A few I ordered to my
specification, like on page 1. The quote on the top of page 8 might be from
Barnum, I'm not sure. The jumping man on page 12 is from an advertisement. I
recognize the style--a popular commercial artist-- but I don't know his name. 
The Chinese on the page is a grocery ad, I think. The Norton money on page 14
is historic,plus my little additions. The apple on page 17,as well as the
triangle on 23 and the Sacred Chao on 50 are, believe it or not, pasteups of
mimeographs, from Seattle Cabal. That group produced the best damn mimeog-
raphy I've ever seen. The Lick Here Box on page 23 is one of many tidbits
making the rounds in alternative/underground newspapers in those days. Trip
5 page header on 29 was a chapter title in one of Tim Leary's books. The
Knight on the bull with the TV antenna on his helmet on page 46 came from a
very artistic magazine called Horseshit and put out by two brothers from Long
Beach. I don't remember their names. Wonderful magazine.

Occupant: Eris told Mal2 what to use and where to find it.

Hill: Yeah, in a way that is right. That is why my name does not appear
anywhere on the PRINCIPIA and why it was published with a broken
copyright--Reprint What You Like. I knew I was taking liberties and didn't
want my intentions to be misunderstood. It was an experiment and was intended
to be an underground work and that involves a different set of ethics than
commercial work.

Gypsie: There are no real names at all?

Hall: Oh, some. Camden Benares is a real name because he legally changed his
original name to his Holy Name. Also, instead of using Mordecai Malignatus I
used Bob Wilson's real name on page 12 because Werewolf Bridge was a work
before Discordianism. And of course real people like Neils Bohr crop up in
quotes. 

Gypsie: What do you think about the PRINCIPIA now? Would you want to change
it?

Hill: I consider it a successful work and I wouldn't want to change it. In
some ways it is immature and I am not the same person I was 10 years ago, but
it accomplished the objectives I set for myself and it has the effect I
wanted it to have. There are a few errors though.

Gypsie: Like what?

Hill: Oh, I changed a quote from Tom Gnostic on page 61 and I don't think he
ever did forgive me for it. He's right. Starbuck's Pebbles should have been
preceded by the Myth of Starbuck which was being saved for something else and
never got used. I should have used it when I had the chance. And then Eris
did a neat little trick on me by having IBM make the Greek selectric
typewriter element not coincide with all the characters on their keyboard. So
the little "kallisti" that appears on the title page and lastly on the back
cover came out "kallixti" and I was too dumb to know the difference.

Gypsie: Will there ever be a Fifth Edition?

Hill: There already is a Fifth Edition, by Mal2. It is a one page telegram
2966

that reduces everything to an infinite aum. I found it at Western Union where
a machine got stuck and kicked out hundreds of pages of nothing but m's. He
made it the Fifth Edition and then left.

Principia/Malaclypse was a very personal work for me and actually took 10
years to culminate. it was one single statement that included my adolescence
in the 50's and my young adulthood in the 60's. When I finally had the
paste-ups done I knew that I had finished it. That is why, quote, Malaclypse
left. I knew it was finished. I didn't know exactly what it was, but it was
done.

Occupant: See?

Gypsie: Earlier you said that you met your objectives. Just what were those
objectives?

Hill: Well, that's hard to answer because it kept refining itself over the
years. In 1969 I mainly though of myself as a cosmic clown and I set out to
prove, by demonstration, that a deity can be anything at all.

In other words, people invent gods and not the other way around. Later I
decided that I was doing some kind of conceptual art.

In the 50's my culture taught me that I was created by and for a deity, a
specific male deity, and that all other deities are FALSE. Yet my growing
experience showed me that any deity is true in some sense and false in some
other sense. So I set out to do what my society told me is impossible--make
a real religion from a patently absurd deity.

In the 50's a female deity was blasphemy. In the 70's a humorous deity is
still considered impossible, ridiculous, and blasphemous. As far as I'm
concerned, I have proven my point. Eris is a real deity and even though I
don't promote Erisianism as a serious religion....

Occupant: I do!

Dexter: You speak for yourself.

Ignotius: Here, here.

Hill: ...I do point out that it makes just as much sense from its own
perspective as all the others do from each of their own perspectives.

Occupant: I think paganism is a valid spiritual path. I encourage Erisianism
because it makes fun of itself. i think this is healthy.

Ignotius: If you can live rewardingly with Goddess Eris you can live with any
deity, including none at all.

Dexter: I don't much go for the worship business but I argee with Occupant
about the spirit of the thing. We live in a time of turmoil, the whole planet
is in a state of change. If we, as a species, cower from the confusion then
we die with the dying. This is revolution.

Ignotius: I am an athiest myself. There is no Greg Hill.

[laughter]

2967

Gypsie [to Hill] : What do you think of ILLUMINATUS?

Hill: Oh, I love it. I was finishing PRINCIPIA when Shea and Wilson were
working on ILLUMINATUS. It took Dell five years to publish it...maybe that is
significant. The 1969 Discordian Society was a mail network between
independent writers of various kinds. Norton Cabal was just me and my
characters and I used the other Cabals as sort of a laboratory. In return
other Discordians would bounce their stuff off of me. We would toss in ideas
and anybody could take anything out. It was a concept stew. The exchanging of
ideas and techniques broadened and encouraged all of us.

I like ILLUMINATUS for the surrealism. A very effective method of writing.

Ignotius: I got misquoted. Worse, I wasn't even in that scene and if I had
been then I would have said something else.

Dexter [to Ignotius]: That was me in that scene.

Ignotius: Oh, is that what that was?

Dexter: He got our names mixed up.

Hill: He got mixed up about me too, in COSMIC TRIGGER. Bob says that when
Oswald was buying the assassination rifle, my girlfriend was printing the
first edition of PRINCIPIA on Jim Garrison's Xerox. It wasn't my girlfriend,
it was Kerry's; it wasn't the FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, it was some earlier
Discordian thought; it wasn't Garrison's Xerox, it was his mimeograph; and it
wasn't just before Kennedy was shot but a couple of years before that.*

The FIRST ED PRINCIPIA, by the way, was reproduced at Xerox Corp when
xerography was a new technology Gypsie. Which was my second New Orleans trip
in 1965. I worked for a guy on Bourbon Street who was a Xerox salesman by
day.

Dexter: I think that George Dorn took too much guff from Hagbard. If someone
pulls a weapon on me, I'm more inclined to either leave or kill the
sonofabitch. 

Occupant: You are supposed to be a pacifist.

Dexter: I'm speaking figuratively of course. I'll tell you more tomorrow.

Gypsie [to Hill]: Did you really translate erotic Etruscan poetry?

Hill: Sure, but I used a pen name. I signed it "Robert Anton Wilson".

[A quick rap is heard on the door]

Gypsie: I have only one question left...

Dexter: I'll get it.

Gypsie: ...what I really want to know is how can we all fit inside of a tiny
little post office box?

Dexter[to Gypsie]:It's a telegram for you, from Mal2.

Gypsie: To me?
2968

[Paper tearing]
 
Gypsie [reading]: "If I told everybody how they could live inside of a post
office box then everybody would stop paying landlords and go live inside
their post office boxes. It would collapse the building! Can you imagine,
post offices collapsing all over the country, the hemisphere, the PLANET! The
whole world's communication system would be destroyed. No,no, I must not say.
I dare not!

-------------
* I checked this further with Mr. Thornley. He says that the woman in
question was not his girlfriend, she was just a friend, and it wasn't a
couple of years before Kennedy was shot but had to be a couple of years after
(but before Garrison investigated Thornley). --GS

Waves upon a timeless shore.
With no begninning, nor an end;
It always knows a foe from friend.

Cycle of creation, birth to bones.
A ring around the silv'ry Moon;
We cast you now, o ancient rune!

Bring understanding, kindness, care,
And loving words, both clear and fair,
Come bless this day our rite of love,
As below then so above.

With love's bright spark our hearts inspire,
Bring passion's flame, bring sweet desire,
Come bless this day our rite of love,

Oh powers of the Western sea,

Come bless this day our rite of love,
As below then so above.


2970

NORTH:
Oh Northern powers of living Earth,
Charge our souls from death to birth,
On solid ground of rock and loam,
Bring forth our food and build our home,

Our work today is a happy one.  We are gathered in the presence of

and the
siging air, and in the sight of the Goddes of our Blessed Earth to celebrate
the joining of our two dear friends Joy and Tom, in union by the fasting of
their hands by ancient rite.

HPS (holding up CORD):
This is the cord of handfasting. It will tie Tom and Joy together with
bonds of love.  For such bonds to be strong they need support -- the
support of the lovers themselves, the support of the Gods and the support
of a community of family and friends.  we ask now that each of you give
your support, letting it flow as loving strength into the cord as it is
passed around the circle.

Love is a River (as CORD is passed around circle)

opposite directions.)

(Music ends when all are in place, or the song is ended.)

too
vast for recording! There is magic to be done here; the magic of Love!

    Joy,
    Thou shalt be the star that rises from the twilight sea
    Thou shalt bring a man dreams to rule his destiny
    Thou shalt bring the moon-tides to the soul of a man
    The tides that flow and ebb, and flow again,
    The magic that moves in the moon and the sea;
    These are thy secret, and they belong to thee.
    Thou art the Eternal Woman, thou art She,
    The tides of all men's souls belong to thee.
    Danu in heaven, on Earth, Persephone,

Tom,
All wild creatures hear thy call upon the haunted wind.
Within thy soul the Horned One returns to Earth again.

And falcons soar from out the sky to perch upon thy hand.
The serpent's wisdom thou shalt learn from tip of forked tongue.
The fleetness of the white stag's flight in starlight or in sun.
Lord of Light and Lord of Shadow; keeper of the key
Which unlocks the door of dreams, whereby men come to thee.
Cernunnos, Tammuz, Horus, Pan; by name we set thee free!
0, Shepherd of the wild woodland, may thou be one with he!

anoints with water, touches to flower petals; censes; then places over
WAND.  The HP & HPS hold WAND aloft between them.)
HPS:
Above you are the stars, below you are the stones.
As time passes, remember...
Like a star should your love be constant,
Like the earth should your love be firm.
Possess one another, yet be understanding.
Have patience each with the other,
For storms will come, but they will go quickly.
Be free in giving of affection and of warmth;
Make love often, and be sensuous to one another.
Have no fear, and let not the ways or words of the unenlightened give
you unease.
For the old gods are with you,
Now and always!

HP (holding wand):
Is it your wish, Joy, to become one with this man?

BRIDE: (answers)

you as long as we both shall live

HP:
Does any say nay?

GROOM:
Then we are happy, but we would yet ask the blessing of the
May Queen on our union.

BRIDE:
2975

Oh Queen of the May, we ask your blessing on our union and
on our connection with this land which is our home upon the Earth.

MAY QUEEN:
As you marry, take my blessing and the blessing of our Mother Earth that
you may live long within Her breast and flourish in Her abundance.
(Takes cord from the altar and hands it to HP and HPS) I bid you bind
them in love with my blessing,

HP & HPS (tying the hands of bride and groom together with the cord):
This day you marry your friend, the one you love, laugh with, live for,
dream with.

HP (handing ATHAME to GROOM):
This knife is for the troubles that lie ahead.

HPS (handing CHALICE to BRIDE):
This cup is for the love that conquers them.

GROOM (holding up ATHAME):
I bring the energy of yang, active, bright, logical and hard.  I bid you
blend these energies with yours to make us whole and keep this token on
the altar of our love.

BRIDE (holding up CHALICE):
I bring the energy of yin, dark, intuitive, flowing and soft.  I bid you
blend these energies with yours and make us whole and keep this token on
the altar of our love.

(GROOM dips ATHAME into CHALICE)

HP:
Yin and yang, male and female, light and dark.  neither may stand
alone, but out of their eternal interplay the universe is born.  So it is
above
and so it is here below.

HP:
Now share you the water of life, the blood of the sacred Goddess our
Mother Earth, water that binds us and all living things to her body.

(BRIDE and GROOM share water and kiss)

HP:
Out of the billions of the Earth, these two have come, have looked
into each other's eyes, and are now made one. Their ways have converged
and shall now be together. In our deepest being we hope that their path
may
be pleasant and the sky fair where they reside. But if trouble comes, as
it
can surely come to all, may the pressure of the trial only bring them
more
closely together. With clasped hands and united hearts, may they bear
life's
sorrows together and share life's joys together.



2976

(BRIDE pours libation and speaks however she is moved, then hands
CHALICE to GROOM, who sips, libates and passes cup to HPS, who sips,
libates and passes CHALICE to HP. COUPLE then moves around the circle

deosil greeting guests while chant is sung:  I am the Heart and the Soul
of
Creation, then return to altar.)

HPS (gives Navajo Wedding Blessing):
Now you will feel no rain, for each of you will be the shelter to the other.
Now you will feel no cold, for each of you shall be the warmth to the other.
Now there is no more loneliness for you.
Now there is no more loneliness.
Now you are two bodies, but there is only one life before you.
Go now to your dwelling place to enter into the days of your togetherness.
And may your days be good and long upon this Earth.

(GROOM thanks guests and invites them to the feast.)

(ASSISTANTS open the gate in SOUTH where the BROOM has been lying and
hold the broom a LITTLE off the ground. HP and HPS: lead the chant:  JUMP
THE BROOM! as COUPLE runs around the circle and jumps the BROOM on the
way out.)

HP & HPS (Stand on opposite sides of altar, raising arms):
We thank you Gods and Goddesses of the Sacred Marriage for
attending and blessing this, our rite of life and love.  We bid you now,
Hail
and Farewell!

ALL:    Hail and Farewell!

HP:
Oh mighty Lord of life and death, whose hooves dance upon the altrar
of Time and whose pipes play the song of Never-Ending, we thank You for
Your blessing and bid You now Hail and Farewell!

ALL:    Hail and Farewell!

HPS:
Oh gracious Goddess, Queen of love and birth whose body is the
green and flowering Earth and the dust at whose feet are the stars of
heaven, we thank You for Your blessing and bid You now Hail and Farewell!

QUARTER CALLERS:
We thank you now, oh powers of Earth (Water, Fire, Air)

HPS:
All from air into air, let the misty curtain part.
All is ended, all is done
What has been must now be gone!
What is done by ancient art
Must merry meet and merry part!
AND MERRY MEET AGAIN!


Well, there it is.  It was beautiful.  And so smooth.  Hope you all
enjoyed it.  Tom wrote the invocation to Pan and Aphrodite.  If you want
2977

to use it though would expect people to ask permission to use it,  since
it is  copyright protected in the Green Egg.

Anyway, this is a guide, and it is OUR h-fasting.  People can use it as a
guide, but it is much more magickal if you create your own.

Thou art Goddess!

I. Starting the Ritual
  A) Processional : (starting Chant {Ku-Wa-Te})
     To enter the circle each person must pass through four "gates"    
representing each of the Three Worlds (Land, Sea & Sky) and Fire. Each person
steps to the first Gate Keeper and is asked: "What do you ask of the Gate of
Earth (Sea) (Air)?" AN answer is given or left unspoken, and the person is
marked by the Guardian (with mud, water and brush of a feather) and proceeds
to the next Gate and is questioned again. The Guardian of the last Gate,
Fire, smudges the person before they enter the circle.  When everyone is in
the circle, the chant continues ("Ku-Wa-Te") as the Gatekeepers come into the
circle and prepare themselves.
   B) Statement of Purpose :
      We are here tonight to honor the Goddess Danu, called the Earth-mother
and to honor the God Belemos, Called the Sun King. We honor them and ask them
to bless us and rekindle the warmth of the world.
   C) Centering Meditation:
     Group meditation and collective consciousness:  All present are brought
together with a group meditation, to form a "group-mind"; to help everyone
center and bring themselves together to work in accord.
  D) Earth Mother Invocation :
         Oh Earth-Mother
         We praise thee
            That seed springeth
            That flower openeth
            That grass groweth
         We praise thee
         For winds that whisper
            Through the shining Birch
            Through the lively Pines
            Through the mighty Oak
         We praise thee
         For all things
         Oh Earth-Mother who gives lifeII.

                             The Active Ritual

    Invocation of Ogma the Gate Keeper or Mannanon in English:
    (Visualization is a triangle shaped iris opening)

 Gate Keeper of Fire:
   O Ogma, Lord of the Gates, Lord of Knowledge, open the ways for us       
  O Mannanon, master of the realm beyond the seas, grant us passage to your
kingdom.
   O great God of knowledge, we wish to walk your roads.
         Reveal to us your teachings, reveal to us the safe path.           
        Come wash the nighttime clean;
         Come Close the gap of darkness in between.
         We praise you for the brightness of your power.
2979

         We praise you for the gift of knowledge.
         Guide us to the place we seek.
         Walk with us Ogma!
         Walk with us Mannanon!

CHANT:         We invoke thee Ogma, opener of every Gate
               We invoke Mannanon, opener of every Gate.
         You shall reach us, You shall teach us and reveal our fate.        
        You shall reach us, You shall teach us and reveal our fate.
   B) Consecration of the Waters:
        [After each cup is consecrated it is passed around the members of   
 the circle so that each may drink from it. When the cup returns to the start
the remaining liquid is spilled unto the Earth or into the fire. Contents may
be spring water, or an alcholic brew if alcohol it is preferred to have been
brewed by a member of the Grove.]

      Druid of the Gate of Land:
     Spirits of nature, of the trees and rocks, of the animals and Earth,

and of life on Earth. Remember us and speak to us in our hearts. Give us your

they step forward and do so, individual offerings to particular patrons or
spirit helpers are done at this time.
   D) Sacrifice with the Willow Branch:
     Gate keeper of fire makes a final offering of a willow branch, to send
the energy to the deities of the occasion. It is sacrificed into the central

                       BRIGIT OF THE CELTS
                       -------------------
   Brigit was one of the great Triple Goddesses of the Celtic people.
She appeared as Brigit to the Irish, Brigantia in Northern England,
Bride in Scotland, and Brigandu in Brittany. Many legends are told
about Brigit. Some say that there are three Brigits : one sister in
charge of poetry and inspiration who invented the Ogham alphabet,
one in charge of healing and midwifery, and the third in charge of the
hearth fire, smithies and other crafts. This catually indicates the
seperate aspects of her Threefold nature and is a neat division of
labor for a hard-working goddess.
   Brigit was probably originally a Sun Goddess, and a charming story
of her birth is that she was born at sunrise and a tower of flame
burst from the forehead of the new born Goddess that reached from
Earth to Heaven. It was likely She who inspired the line in the famous
Song of Amergin: "I am a fire in the head." Her penchant for smithcraft
led to her association by the Romans with Minerva/Athena. As a warrior
Goddess, She favored the use of the spear or the arrow. Indeed, various
interpetations of her name exist including, "Bright Arrow," "The Bright
One," "the Powerful One" and "The High One," depending upon the region
and the dialect.
   As a Goddess of herbalism, midwifery and healing She was in charge
of Water as well as Fire. I don't beleive that anyone has ever
counted all teh vast number of sacred wells and springs named after
or dedicated to this Goddess. A story is told of how two lepers came
to one of her sacred springs for healing and She instructed one Leper
to wash the other. The skin of the freshly bathed man was cleansed
of the disease and Brigit told the man who was healed to wash the man
who had bathed him so that both men would be whole. The man who was
healed was now too disgusted to touch the other Leper and would have
left him, but Brigit herself washed the leper and struck down the
other arrogant fellow with leperousy once more before he could leave.
Offerings to the watery Brigit were cast into the well in the form
of coins or, even more ancient, brass or gold rings. Other sacrifices
were offered where three streams came together. Her cauldron of
Inspiration connected her watery healing aspect with her fiery poetic
aspect.
   Brigit is clearly the best example of the survival of a Goddess
into Christian times. She was cannonized by the Catholic church as
St. Brigit and various origins are given to this saint. The most
popular folktale is that She was midwife to the Virgin Mary, and thus
was always inviked by women in labor. The more official story was
that She was a Druid's daughter who predicted the coming of
Christianity and then was baptised by St. Patrick. She became a nun
and later an abbess who founded the Abbey at Kildare. The Christian
Brigit was said to have had the power to appoint the bishops of her
area, a strange role for an abbess, made stranger by her requirement
that her bishops also be practicing goldsmiths.
   Actually, the Goddess Brigit had always kept a shrine at Kildare,
Ireland, with a perpetual flame tended by nineteen virgin priestesses
called Daughters of the Flame. No male was ever allowed to come near
it; nor did those women ever consort with men. Even their food and
other supplies were brought to them by women of the nearby village.
When Catholicism took over in Ireland, the shrine became a convent
and the priestesses became nuns but the same traditions were held
and the eternal flame was kept burning. Their tradition was that
each day a different priestess/nun was in charge of the sacred fire
and on the 20th day of each cycle, teh fire was miraculously tended
2983

by Brigit Herself. There into the 18th century, the ancient song
was sung to her : "Brigit, excellant woman, sudden flame, may the
bright fiery sun take us to the lasting kingdom."
   For over a thousand years, the sacred flame was tended by nuns,
and no one knows how long before that it had been tended by the
priestesses. In 1220 CE, a Bishop became angered by the no-males
policy of the Abbey of St. Brigit of Kildare. He insisted that nuns
were subordinate to priests and therefore must open their abbey
and submit themselves to inspection by a priest. When they refused
and asked for another Abbess or other female official to perform
any inspections, the Bishop was incensed. He admonished them to
obediance and then decreed that teh keeping of the eternal flame
was a Pagan custom and 6rdered the sacred flame to be extinguished.
Even then, She remained the most poular Irish saint along with
Patrick. In the 1960's, under Vatican II modernization, it was
declared that there was insufficient proof of Brigit's sanctity
or even of her historical existance, and so teh Church's gradual
pogrom against Brigit was successful at last and She was thus
decanonized. It is very difficult to obtain images or even holy
cards of ST. Brigit outside of Ireland anymore.
   Her festival is held on Febuary 1st or 2nd. It corresponds to
the ancient Celtic fire festival of Imbolc or Oimelc which
celebrated the birthing and freshening of sheep and goats (it really
is a Feast of Milk). This festival was Christianized as Candlemas
or Lady Day and Her Feast day, La Feill Bhride, was attended by
tremendous local celebration and elaborate rituals. Her festival
is also called Brigit. Brigit (the Goddess and the Festival)
represents the stirring of life again after the dead months of the
winter, and her special blessings are called forth at this time.
Since She was booted out of teh Church for being Pagan, it is
incumbant upon us Pagans to restore Her worship to its former glory
especially those of us of Celtic ancestory. Here is an ancient rite
to invite Brigit into your home at the time of her Holiday:
   Clean your hearth thoroughly in teh morning and lay a fire
without kindling it, then make yourself a "Bed for Brigid" and
place it near the hearth. The bed can be a small basket with covers
and tiny pillow added as plain or fancy as you like. If you have no
hearth, you can use the stove and put the bed behind it. Then at
sundown light a candle rubbed with rosemary oil and invite Brigit
into your home and into er bed; use the candle to kindle your
hearthfire if possible. Make your own poem to invite Her or use
the ancient song mentioned earlier. Let the candle burn at least
all night in a safe place. You might even want to begin the custom
of keeping the eternal flame; it is a popular custom in some
magickal and Wiccan traditions. AFter all, it's up to us now to
keep the spirit of Brigit alive and well for the next thousand
years at least!!!

Brigid is not really a Celtic Mother Goddess.  She is generally
considered a Goddess of fire/smithcraft, of poetry and of healing.  One
of her roles is as midwife, but although she has a son, she is not
usually seen as a mother.

I don't know any books that deal specifically with Brighidh, but please
look for a book called "Celtic Mythology" by Proinsias MacCana and for
"Gods and Heroes of the Celts" by Marie Lousie Sjoestadt for more
information about Celtic deities.  They are both VERY good sources.

2984

Brighidh is a Goddess of healing, smithcraft and poetry, brewer of mead
and ale, a lawgiver, a midwife, supposedly daughter of the Daghda,
mother of the poet Cairbre, and of the Gods Brian, Iuchar and Iucharba.
She was transformed into a Christian Saint and became the foster mother
of Christ.  Some sources say that the healer/smith/poet were embodied in
one Goddess, other sources claim that she was three sisters, all named
Brighidh.

Her holy day falls (on our calendar) on February 2nd (I wonder if She
likes groundhogs...) called Imbolc, Oimelc or Lady Day.  Candles are
blessed that day in the Catholic churches.

Re: Somethnig about Brighid:

Brigit/Brigid/Bride was the daughter of Dagda. She was the proctector of the
poets, the forge and the healing persons. Her son Ruadan, which she had with
Bres, was killed by Goibnui. For her died son she sounds the first kenning of
Eireland. She also was put into the cult and the person of Brigit from
Kildare, which made the first female parish after Christianity falls into
Eireland. The convent of Kildare has had a neverending fire, which was
protected by the sisters of the parish. The saint Brigit is the second patron
saint of Eireland.  within the scottish tradition Brigit belongs together
with the time of the year "Season of the lambs" and the comming of spring.
Brigit overcomes the control of the Cailleach Bheur.

                    A Comparative Approach to
             Liturgical History, Theology and Design
             =======================================
           A Heartland Pagan Festival Keynote Address
                         by Mike Nichols


Participants:  Morning Glory Zell
               Otter Zell
               Rhiannon Bennett
               Carolyn Clark
               Eldoreth Grey Squirrel
               Anahita
               Morwen
               Chris
               Dix
               other audience members not identified


[NOTE:  This transcription was made from an audio tape dub of a
videorecording of the event.  The microphone placement made some
of the comments from the audience unintelligible, and those
sections were omitted.  In some cases, the comments were picked
up but it was impossible to identify the speaker.  Because of the
lack of visual cues, it is also possible that some of the
speakers are incorrectly identified.  To improve readability,
some very minor editing was done.]


Rhiannon:  I'd like to introduce someone whom we are really proud
to have in our community.  He has been involved in Witchcraft --
in teaching free Witchcraft classes -- for over eighteen years
now.  He is also a teacher of parapsychology at the University of
Missouri at Kansas City.  He owns the Magick Lantern, which is
our occult bookstore here in town -- the ONLY occult bookstore we
actually have here in town.  He's very instrumental in
introducing people to Wicca through his classes -- over 6,000
people!  Granted all of them didn't decide to stay with us, which
is fine.  But think how many myths that helped shatter, and
helped to make us a valid religion in some people's eyes.  And a
lot of times, that's what we need.  Every time I say something
about a particular speaker, people say "Well, what has he
written?  What has she written?"  Books are really wonderful but,
as I'm sure you've read, there are some good books, and there are
some mediocre books, and there are some that are pure trash out
there.  Just because they say they're a Pagan writer doesn't mean
a thing.  Sort through and pick out the good stuff.  People like
Mike help us go through and figure out what's real and what's not
real.  And then help you decide, even out of what's real, what's
real for you.  So I'm really proud to have him in our community,
and I'd like to welcome him.

(APPLAUSE) 
 
Mike Nichols:  I hope you don't mind if I do this sitting down. 
I want to present it more like a workshop than a standard
lecture.  First of all, I want to start out with a few thank
2986

you's.  I just want to say a personal thank you to Rhiannon who
has acted as liaison between the Heartland Spiritual Alliance and
the Magick Lantern, which was sometimes a difficult and thankless
task, but she's done it well.  When I saw her stand on the chair
in the hall last night and scream "TWO pieces of chicken!  ONLY
two!", I thought I've never seen anyone look so much in their
element.  (LAUGHTER)  So thank you so much.  And not only to
Rhiannon, but to the organizers of the Heartland Pagan Festival
all together.  I think they've done a wonderful job.  Let's give
them a hand. 
 
(APPLAUSE) 
 
     What we're going to be doing in here is kind of an advanced
class on ritual design, what we sometimes like to call liturgics. 
Before this is all over, we're going to be into such areas as
liturgical theology, liturgical history, and liturgical
aesthetics.  For those of you who are local and who have taken my
class, or seen me do speeches at psychic fairs and such, you will
be happy to note that this is not recycled material.  This is the
very first time I am presenting any of this material anywhere. 
So I hope you enjoy it. 
 
     I'm starting from the premise that most people here are
already fairly well advanced in Paganism and have gotten to the
point where they already know about ritual and realize why it's
there, why  there is a need for it, and are beginning to ask
other questions about ritual.  What does it take to make a "good"
ritual?  What kind of elements do you need to have, what kind of
order, what kind of structure does a ritual have to have to work? 
Are there certain things a ritual needs to work?  How can you
tell if a ritual has worked?  And questions like that start
happening only after you've been into it a little while. 
 
     If you are new to this whole area, and really are not that
conversant with why ritual is used anyway, let me just gloss that
point by saying there are a couple of really good books that I
think give you a good understanding of that.  One is "The Spiral
Dance" by Starhawk.  Another is "Drawing Down the Moon" by Margot
Adler.  I think either one of those would inform you as to why
Witches use ritual in the first place. 
 
     The need for ritual is sometimes one of the most difficult
things for newcomers in this area to understand because quite
often, if they've been brought up in a religious tradition that
downplays ritual, for example, (and many Protestant religious
traditions say that ritual is only so much gobbledy-gook, etc.,
that there's nothing to it), it's a real stumbling block for
people to understand why the ritual is there.  I've noticed that
people with Roman Catholic backgrounds or a background in Judaism
seem to have a better grasp on what ritual is there for and what
it accomplishes. 
 
     When we get into this kind of work, let me just say that
much of my talk here today is going to be highly speculative,
highly theoretical, and please do not take it as a final position
paper on anything.  It is at best a preliminary report on work in
progress.  We're going to do a lot of comparative liturgics as a
2987

way of understanding our own ritual development. 
 
     When it comes to ritual or liturgy -- whichever word you
want to use, and I'm going to be using them interchangeably -- it
has always seemed to me that liturgical theology should be on the
cutting edge of theological concerns in Paganism.  There are many
religious writers who believe that religions basically have three
dimensions -- any religion.  First of all, it's theology: what
are it's beliefs?  Secondly, it's social structure: how does this
religion impact on the world around it?  And thirdly, it's
ritual: what do the people do to express their religious values? 
It has always seemed to me that within Paganism in general, and
Witchcraft certainly in particular, it is the liturgical
dimension that is the most often in focus. 
 
     Theology I think has been rather slow.  It is developing,
Pagan theological concerns, but it's developing late.  If you
read Starhawk and Adler and people like that, you're beginning to
see the beginnings of Pagan theology. 
 
     As far as the social dimension, there was a time of course
when Paganism had a social dimension, when most people were
Pagan.  But for the last couple of thousand years we have been a
minority religion -- a very small minority in some cases.  And I
think because of that we don't yet have a very strong
sociological impact.  But that too may be changing, through
festivals like this, when Pagans start gathering in big enough
numbers to start talking about such things as social change.  For
example, at one of the workshops we had the other day, somebody
suggested that one of the things Pagans could do to increase
their visibility and positive image in the community is to take
on community projects like answering telephones for the local
public TV telethons.  Yes, this is our local Coven on the phone
lines!  (LAUGHTER)  Or this is the local Coven who have all
decided to go down and do a park clean-up on a particular day. 
When we get enough people doing stuff like that, then Witchcraft
will have its social dimension. 
 
     In the meantime, the strongest dimension I think for most of
us is the ritual, is the liturgy.  When you tell somebody you're
a Witch, the first thing they ask you is "What do you do?" -- not
"What do you believe?" or "What is your impact on society?" --
but "What do you do?"  They want to hear about your rituals.  I
think that's exactly why Stewart Farrar titled his first book on
Witchcraft "What Witches Do". 
 
     So we've got to start looking at what we do, in terms of
ritual and how ritual has developed.  However, when it comes to
trying to study liturgy in modern Paganism, you are immediately
arrested by the fact that there is no coherent study of it.  Yes,
there are books of rituals.  Sure, you can buy a spellbook here,
a grimoire there.  Marion Weinstein has published a Book of
Shadows.  The last half of Doreen Valiente's book is a Book of
Shadows.  Scott Cunningham's got books of spells, etc.  But is
there any systematic study of all this stuff put together?  No. 
Not so far. 
 
     I think the reason is because development has been so rapid. 
2988

All of this stuff has come along so fast that people have not had
a chance to assess it and evaluate it, and ask significant
questions about it.  Consequently, both the scholar and the lay
person really don't have very many places to go when it comes to
this. 
 
     There are a few things though that you can say about
religious ritual.  First of all, religious ritual is a human
experience, a very universal human experience.  It is as real as
fear, and as important as love.  It has a meaning of its own.  It
is not some sort of aberration or distortion of reality.  It is
an injection of new meaning into the reality around you.  There
is hardly a culture in the world that has not developed its
religious rituals.  And sometimes by looking at religious rituals
of other cultures, we can begin understanding our own better. 
That's one of things I'm gonna try to do here. 
 
     There's a strange continuity, a sameness when you start
looking at different rituals, that pervades all of them.  We find
that rituals, for example, are transpersonal and transcultural. 
People seem to experience the same types of things no matter
where you look all over the world. 
 
     In looking at liturgical theology, I have been doing an
awful lot of work in terms of comparative study.  Because the
only group of people who have systematically writing about
liturgical theology for any length of time are the Christians. 
Does this have anything to say to us as Pagans?  Perhaps it does. 
Reason:  I think most Pagans are by now well aware of the fact
that the Christians have borrowed a heck of a lot from the old
Pagan religions.  For example, it's commonly known that the old
Pagan holidays served as models for Christian holidays, so that
the modern Christian liturgical calendar is to a great extent
based on older Pagan themes.  And ironically, sometimes you can
look at what Christians have written about these to find out
still more about the Pagan themes that underlie it.

     A second area where this is true is what we call
hagiography, the study of saints.  So many of the saints in the
rites of the Roman Catholic Church are in fact simply
Christianized forms of old Pagan gods and goddesses.  So we read
about the legends of these saints, and we learn a little bit more
about the gods and goddesses underlying those legends.  I think
Pagans generally realize both of these points.  What Pagans do
not generally realize is that it is the same as far as liturgical
ceremonies go, too.  When you get right down to it, Christianity
-- especially the way the Roman Catholic Church developed in the
early years of Christianity -- borrowed most of its liturgical
traditions from the Pagans. 
 
     I mean, if you ever stopped and thought about it...  For
example, within the Roman Catholic Church, there are certain
rituals known as "sacraments", right?  Do you realize that is a
Pagan word?  Sacrament comes from the Latin "sacramentum" and was
an oath given by a Roman soldier to his gods.  It was a ritual
setting.  We might be well advised once again to reclaim the word
sacrament and use it as our own. 
 
2889

     According the Catholic Church, a sacrament is an "effective"
ritual, which means that it produces an objective effect.  This
is not just a symbolic commemoration of something.  This is
something that actually produces a change in reality.  This
beginning to sound familiar? 
 
     Other things which we have long considered primarily
Christian -- Again, I'm going to be drawing this almost
exclusively from the background of Roman Catholic liturgics,
which is one of the ones that is most developed.  The High
Anglican would be another good source if you wanted to look into
this.  The practice of "genuflection", of bowing on one knee,
originally a Pagan practice.  The practice of kissing ritual
tools.  If you were in a Catholic church, did you ever see a
priest pick up a Missal at Mass and kiss it, put it on the altar? 
The same way a priestess will sometimes kiss her athame after
she's used it for an invocation?  Yet another custom borrowed by
the Christians from the Pagans.  So it seems real obvious to me
that we could look at the whole question of sacramental rites,
and ask what have the various Christian writers had to say about
them in terms of how they work, in order to find out what Pagans
probably also originally believed about rites and rituals. 
 
     Although at a later time the Catholic Church would limit the
number of official sacraments to be only seven in number, at an
earlier time this was not true.  Anything could be seen as a
sacrament.  A blessing was a sacrament.  A holiday, a sacred
object, all of these things could be considered sacramental in
what they did.  As a matter of fact, the first use of the word
"sacrament" within a Christian context was not until 210 C.E. and
it was by the Church writer Tertulian.  He was the first one to
use that word in a Christian context, and when he did so,
ironically, he accused the Greek mystery religions of having
stolen that word from the Christians.  Obviously, it was
precisely the other way around. 
 
     Although today the word sacrament refers primarily to only
seven ecclesial rituals within the Catholic Church, all of which
-- or at least six of which -- have parallels in Paganism, the
word "sacrament" is still used in comparative theology in a much
broader sense.  Basically, it refers to any hidden reality, any
sign or symbol of a hidden reality that is mysterious and sacred. 
I could be a person, a place, or a thing.  Any of these things
could be considered sacramental. 
 
     From the point of view of Pagan theology, by the way, with
its strong emphasis on the theological perspective called
"immanence", the in-dwelling quality of the divine force in all
of nature, for a Pagan practically anything can become a
sacrament.  Every rock, every tree, everything is alive with
magical and sacred powers which a Pagan can get in touch with and
from there connect with the entire universe.  That's what a
sacrament is. 
 
     There have been, historically, at least two ways of viewing
rituals and sacraments.  The first is the way as practiced by
social anthropologists.  For example, one of the most famous of
these was proposed by Arnold van Gennep, who was the first to
2990

come up with the idea of rituals being, as he called them, "rites
of passage".  He would point to something like a marriage rite,
and we can find rites like that in practically every society. 
And he would say that the reason this ritual was important for
this society is that it marked a transition for one member of the
society from one social role to another.  From the status of
being unmarried to the status of being married.  In many
societies, kids when they hit the age of puberty go through a
rite of passage.  This is an official recognition by the society
as a whole that this person, who was once considered a child, is
now considered an adult and has adult responsibilities. 
 
     Van Gennep originally thought that practically all religious
rituals were rites of passage.  Later social anthropologists have
pointed out there's at least one other major class or rituals. 
And this is not a rite of passage but what we call a "rite of
celebration".  Very distinct from a rite of passage.  In a rite
of passage, we talk about a person's transition from one social
role to another.  In a rite of celebration -- let's take for an
example a wedding anniversary -- nothing is changing here.  We
are simply looking at something which has a permanent value and
belief structure, and we are celebrating it.  We are focusing on
it.  We are saying this is important to us.  And we're going to
have this ritual to let everybody know how important it is to us. 
A rite of passage is a rite of transition, but a rite of
celebration is a rite of intensification.  It intensifies the
values and beliefs that are already present. 
 
     That was one of two ways of classifying religious rituals. 
The other is the psychological approach.  And probably the best
writer in this field is Mircea Eliade.  He called sacramental
rituals -- he had a wonderful phrase for it -- he called them
"doors to the sacred".  Every sacramental ritual, he said, is an
invitation to a religious or sacred experience.  An invitation,
which you may accept or not.  You can either let yourself become
a part of a ritual or not.  You can make up your mind to distance
yourself from it.  But its basic design, the basic reason for a
sacramental ritual is to give you an invitation to have an
experience of the sacred.  Which Eliade calls a "hierophany", an
experience of the sacred. 
 
     Practically all of these experiences involve altered states
of perception, in terms of an altered sense of time and an
altered sense of space.  And we all have these understandings. 
For example, to most of us a tree is a tree.  But what about the
tree that you had your treehouse in when you were a little kid? 
That tree is special.  There is no other tree like that tree
anywhere else in the world.  It is sacred.  A funeral home -- you
see them on every other street corner; they're just a building. 
Except the funeral home that you attended your grandfather's
funeral in.  You walk into that funeral home and space seems
different.  It is charged with a meaning that normal space -- a
normal other funeral home -- does not have. 
 
     Time is the same way; the sense of time can change. 
Anniversaries, celebrations of New Year's, celebrations like that
take us back to a time that's kind of outside of time, if you
will.  And once again, charges that time with a special meaning. 
2991

Time may even seem to pass differently.  I think for me the best
expression of this has always been in fairy tales.  When somebody
goes into the next world, the world of faery, and experiences the
passage of time differently. 
 
     So all of these -- what Mircea Eliade calls "hierophanies"
-- all of them have to do with altered states of perception,
which include both time and space.  This is remarkably similar,
by the way, to Dion Fortune's famous definition of magick, the
"ability to alter consciousness at will".  We're obviously
talking about the same kind of thing here. 
 
     Most hierophanies, the great majority of them, are
individual.  They are personal.  Whether it's watching a sunset,
visiting a sacred place, walking up to Stonehenge and standing in
the center of it (and having the same feeling you had as you
stood in your last magic Circle), this is sacred space.  This is
an individual and personal experience.  But these religious
experiences can also be shared.  It happens when we sing the
national anthem.  It happens when we sing the old school song. 
It happens when a group of us gets together to go see a dramatic
or theatrical presentation.  In this case, we open ourselves
collectively to an experience of the sacred.  Which again is what
a sacramental rite is all about. 
 
     One other interesting thing about these experiences is that
it is almost universally experienced that the high charge of
meaning that is found in the rite is experienced as "discovered"
or "encountered".  It sort of dawns upon you.  "Oh wow!  That's
what this is all about!  Yeah, I get it now!"  It's not something
that is artificially enforced on the ritual from the outside.  It
should grow organically from the ritual. 
 
     It's interesting to note that in Judeo-Christian tradition,
this sacredness is quite often found in history.  In the
historical development of a God that interacts with a "chosen
people" throughout a period of history.  Whereas in Pagan
theology, sacredness is most usually found not in history but in
nature.  That every tree, every rock, everything is alive, that
you can get in touch with it, that it has a magical and sacred
essence and you can interact with that, and get in touch with the
Cosmos as a whole through that. 
 
     It's interesting to note, too, that because of this the
Judeo-Christian tradition places a very strong emphasis on sacred
writings, or scripture.  Whereas many of the old Pagan religions
-- taking the old Druid religion as a fine example -- made it
forbidden to write down sacred material.  Druids teach it, bards
sing it, dancers dance it -- but you don't write it.  They
realized it was too sacred for that.  So we have these very
definite distinctions in terms of how we've approached these
sorts of things. 
 
     Another way of looking at a ritual is this:  Most of us are
familiar with the way a myth takes the values and beliefs of a
religion and embodies them in story form.  A ritual takes the
values and beliefs of a religion and embodies them in actions. 
That's why quite often a ritual is a myth enacted.  Ritual drama,
2992

for example. 
 
     As I said at the beginning, I think many Pagans are aware of
how Christians have borrowed from us in terms of calendar
customs, and how they've borrowed our gods to use as their
saints.  But we've seldom examined how the Christian religion has
borrowed our sacred rites.  They have.  The Catholic Church now
recognizes seven official sacraments.  And virtually all of them
-- or at least six of them -- have Pagan origins. 
 
     First of all, the rite called "Baptism".  That's the first
ecclesial ritual in the Roman Catholic Church.  Or "Christening",
as it's sometimes called.  It turns out once again that
practically every "primitive" culture has similar rites of
blessing of a child.  In ancient, pre-Christian, Pagan Celtic
society, there was a similar rite.  It had to do with sprinkling
a child with water, passing the child through the smoke of a
fire, passing it through a hole in a stone or else touching it to
the earth (getting in all the elements here), and quite often
passing the child around a circle, handing the baby around so
that each person in the circle gets to hold it for a short time. 
If you want descriptions of this taken from people who seem to
remember these pre-Christian ceremonies, look at the work of
folklorist Alexander Carmichael in the six-volume set, the
"Carmina Gaedelica".  Some of these rites had been Christianized,
of course, even at the time Carmichael was taking them down.  But
a lot of their Pagan origins are still very clear.
 
     In Pagan Celtic society, by the way, this rite was called a
"seining".  Which I would like to propose as a much better term
for this kind of rite in Paganism than the more recently coined
word "Wiccaning".  I oppose that terminology for two reasons. 
One, it's obviously a word that was coined recently to be a
counterpart to the term "Christening".  So the word itself is not
historically attested.  Secondly, think of what it implies!  When
you "Christen" a child, you are introducing it into the body of
Christ, the Church.  You are making it a Christian.  I don't
think that any Witch thinks that "Wiccaning" a child is making
that child a Witch!  I've never heard any Pagan put it that way. 
At the very most, you are blessing the child, asking the gods'
protection for this child "so that no harm comes to the child, or
to anyone else through the child" (as it is commonly expressed)
until such a time as that child is able to choose its own
religion.  We do not attempt to make that choice for the child. 
It is simply a rite of blessing and protection.  Strangely
enough, that is exactly what the word "seining" means.  And
therefore I think it's much better than the alternative
"Wiccaning". 
 
     The Christian religion also has a sacrament called the
"Eucharist".  By the way, if ever anybody challenges you that the
Christian religion doesn't employ magic, take a look at what the
Catholic Church has to say about the sacrament of the Eucharist,
or what they call "the blessed sacrament" -- THE blessed
sacrament.  The official term for what happens is
"transubstantiation" -- that the priest actually has the power to
turn common bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus!  If
that isn't a magical act, I don't know what one is!  Although the
2993

Church would be loath to use the word "magic" in this context. 
But we certainly understand what it's all about. 
 
     The idea of blessing food and drink, however, once again
seems to be one of those universal rites.  When people sit down
to a shared dinner, a common meal, it is a rite of inclusion. 
Even in the early Christian Church, you were not allowed to
partake in the Eucharistic meal unless you were already a member
of that church.  So the fact that in the Wiccan tradition you
share "cakes and ale" would imply an inclusion in the membership
of that group.  And of course, there are all the symbolic
associations of food as sustenance. 
 
     We also have the sacrament of Confirmation in the Catholic
Church.  Which always sounded strange to me when I was growing
up.  You know, you're twelve years old now, and it's time for you
to be "confirmed".  It's almost like up until then you were only
"tentative".  (LAUGHTER)  But now you're confirmed.  What it
really meant, though, was the person was supposedly old enough by
now to make a free choice (cough) of which religion they wanted
to belong to.  And the bishop --  You'll notice here, by the way,
that the proper minister for this rite is the bishop, not the
priest.  Although it is possible for a bishop to delegate the
power to a priest.  But the bishop comes and confirms you into
this religion.  Again, we have so many rites from so many Pagan
systems that this seems to based on that are usually referred to
as "initiation" ceremonies, or rites of passage, rites of
adulthood.  When finally the child is brought fully into the
religious and social (in most primitive societies, they are the
same) structure of the society and is now seen to be a full
adult.  So any first degree initiation could serve as a model for
what the Catholic Church came to call Confirmation. 
 
     Ordination.  This is a right that ONLY a bishop can perform,
in the Catholic Church.  Only a bishop can make a priest.  You'll
notice that when we look at how initiation rites are
traditionally done in Wicca, any priest or priestess can make
another priest or priestess.  And quite often, it looks like in
the oldest rites, it also involved a kind of "laying on of
hands".  There was an imposition of hands that occurred in the
Catholic tradition, as well.  And until that time, a novice
priest was actually told that it would be wrong or DANGEROUS for
him to perform some of the priestly functions unless he had been
made a priest! 
 
     And there were all sorts of stories in the old days that
only a priest could touch the consecrated elements.  Only a
priest's hands -- only consecrated hands -- could touch the
vessels that held the consecrated elements: the chalice, the
monstrance, the ciborium, and so forth.  This almost implies to
me, though it's never quite stated in this way, but it almost
seems like there is some sort of real, tangible, psychic energy
that is present. 
 
     I remember being regaled with stories when I was a little
kid going to a Catholic school where the nuns would tell these
wonderful stories about how some poor person was kneeling at the
altar rail waiting to receive Communion, and the priest comes
2994

along to administer Communion, and drops the Host.  And the poor
person reaches out to try to catch it, and at the first touch of
this consecrated object, there is a tremendous flash of
lightning, and the person is now a little pile of ashes on the
altar carpet. (LAUGHTER) 
 
     I don't think it's quite like that.  But what it may be
saying is that some of these powers, even within magical
traditions or Pagan traditions, are tangible and do carry some
sort of psychic clout.  I don't think lightning is going to flash
out of the sky and reduce you to cinders.  But what we're saying
is a metaphor, really, that there may be some kind of psychic
backlash if you attempt to wield these magical energies before
your training has been finished, before you're ready to handle
them, before you understand what you're doing.  In the same way
that a good psychotherapy session, if it uncovers too much
garbage from your subconscious, can throw you backward if you're
not ready to deal with the stuff that's dredged up. 
 
     For those of you who believe there is some sort of validity
to the concept of "apostolic succession", the imposition of
hands, it also may imply that, when one priest or priestess makes
another priest or priestess, she is passing on a kind of MAGICAL
SHIELDING as well.  A protection, so that you will be able to
handle these magical powers without any ill effect.  For those of
you who believe that the initiation tradition is valid.  Again,
if you want to see Pagan examples of that, look at some of the
work done by Alexander Carmichael.  There is a rite called a
"shielding" where one person kneels, while a second person puts
one hand under their knees and the other hand over their head and
says "Everything that is between my two hands is protected and
seined by the Mother".  The Goddess has control of everything in
this sphere.  It's a passing on of this shielding, that until you
have, it might be dangerous for you to experiment with these
powers.  IF you believe that's a valid idea.  (We'll get into
questions of validity in just a minute.) 

     The Christian tradition of marriage, of course...  Well, in
every society that we know of, we have rituals that talk about
people getting together.  However, ever since the Judeo-Christian
system has come along, we've been firmly locked into only one way
of viewing marriage -- a monogamous way of viewing marriage, for
one thing -- with very little latitude in terms of variability. 
If you look at the Pagan idea of Handfasting, if you go back to
the Irish pre-Christian brehon laws, you will find that they talk
about at least ten different forms of what we today call
marriage.  These forms include such things as marriage between
two people of the same gender, marriage of more than two people
(what today we would call a "group marriage"), marriages that
only last for a "year and a day" or some other specified time
(what today we might call a "trial marriage"), marriages that did
not demand sexual exclusivity (what today we would call "open
marriage"), "contract marriage", the woman keeping her own name,
pre-nuptial and post-nuptial property arrangements.  (If you've
ever read about the great pillow-talk argument between Queen
Maeve and King Aillil about who had the most property, you know
what I'm talking about!)

2995

     You know, it's fascinating to think that all of the
so-called marriage innovations that occurred in the 1960's, that
we thought were so mind-bogglingly new... nope!  They were all
there in the old Pagan form of this rite.  They were *standard*,
until the Christian form of marriage with its single theme, its
monogamous monotheistic vision, it's vision of the one right and
only way to do something, came along and knocked the older one
aside.  But again, the Pagan origins are obvious. 
 
     The ecclesial sacrament called "Last Rites"...  We have all
sorts of what we call "death blessings" in the Gaelic Pagan
traditions, to send the spirit on its way.  For each person who
dies, there is one particular person assigned to be the leader of
these rites who from that time on is known as the dead person's
"soul friend".  This is the one who will carry out the rituals,
remember them when Samhain comes around, set out the extra places
at the table, etc.  We perhaps have less historical data on the
Last Rite theme than we have for certain other themes that we're
talking about here.  But it is still there.  And again a
reference to some of the early folklorists. 
 
     The one modern Christian sacrament that I cannot really find
an exact parallel for in terms of a pre-Christian precursor in
Paganism is the sacrament the Roman Catholic Church calls
"Penance", or "Confession".  Isn't that interesting?  The whole
sacrament has to do with confessing your sins to a priest, who
then absolves you of the sins.  It is a whole thing of guilt, and
release from guilt.  Yes? 
 
Morning Glory:  There were blood guilt rituals, because if you
caused an accidental or even on-purpose death, you had to pay a
wyrguild to the family.  In the New World, the Aztecs had a thing
where if you caused the death of someone, you became a surrogate
for that person.  So there were things like that. 
 
Mike Nichols:  Okay, good point.  I can think of an Irish example
of that, now that you mention it.  The Chucullain legend is a
good example.  Chucullain, who was originally Setanta,
accidentally on purpose kills this very ferocious dog, and walks
up to the gate-keeper and says, "I've killed your dog and I would
like to replace him."  And the gate-keeper says "Fine, there go
some cats.  Get busy."  (LAUGHTER)  I think that's where that
joke started. 
 
Morning Glory:  Samhain was also a time -- and Walpurgisnacht,
especially Walpurgisnacht -- was a time when you took stuff from
that year and purged it in the fire.  And you would have to then
go and get it straight with any other people inside the Circle
that you shared.

Mike Nichols:  I noticed that in a lot of the Pagan traditions,
the purging of one's "guilt" (and I think we're very misguided to
use the term "guilt" here)...

Morning Glory:  Responsibility.

Mike Nichols:  Responsibility, right -- is a matter of making
recompense to the person or persons who were wronged.  It's not a
2996

matter of carrying around a guilt trip until somebody says "Okay,
if you'll go through this ritual, you will be absolved."

(unidentified):  A couple of things I've run into recently, one
was in a work of fiction.  These three young girls rob this woman
who later turns out to be a Witch.  It's on this psychic journey
where they have the bodies of these 12th century people.  And one
ends up a peasant.  And he couldn't help but notice these weird
little Pagan things that kept cropping up that these people had
kept for centuries.  And one of the things was that on the first
day of Spring, the village priest preached a sermon that "dancing
leads to damnation".  Apparently, on the first day of Spring, all
the peasants would go out and dance everything out.  And that
would really help them out.  It got rid of all the pains of the
Winter, someone had been murdered, and a baby had died of
starvation.

Otter Zell:  There was a common form that I can't identify
specifically, but it's a theme I've come across in a lot of
anthropological studies.  But it's the basis of what we call, not
a "trial" really, but more like "mediation".  If there's a
conflict between parties about something or if someone feels
they've been wronged by someone, then the parties would be
brought together within the community of people, and everybody
would have to tell their stories.  Then they would ask them "What
do you think would be a fair settlement?  What do you think would
be fair?"  And this was just talked out in the context of the
community of people, until everything was worked out to
everyone's satisfaction.  And we've used this ourselves in our
Circle under such situations, and it's been incredibly effective,
very powerful.

     And the ultimate, if this could not be worked out, there
were several ways of dealing with it.  The heaviest one was
generally banishment, where the person would simply be sent away. 
And the next heaviest one would probably be ostracism, where the
person would not be spoken to.  He would be ignored, they'd
pretend he didn't exist for a period of time.  Highly effective. 
Of course, the more simple and basic ones would be working out
appropriate compensation that everyone would be satisfied with. 
So there were these procedures, but it wasn't the same thing as
"guilt".  The concept of "sin" and "guilt", and the idea that you
could go to a priest instead of the person you'd wronged, and
that the priest could absolve your soul of guilt.  And we still
have that today, where you go to a trial, and the judge finds you
"guilty" and he fines you or sends you to jail, but the person
who's been fucked over is still fucked over.  (LAUGHTER)

Morning Glory:  They don't get their money back that you stole. 
It goes to the State, for some odd reason.  

Mike Nichols:  Exactly.  These are things that I think we all
ought to think about.  What I'm trying to do in the first part of
this presentation is to focus your attention on how we might be
able to look at Christian liturgical rites to find information
about their predecessors as to how they might have been done in
Pagan societies.  Because all of these things we've talked about,
the so-called "seven sacraments of the Catholic Church -- if you
2997

look for data that Jesus himself instituted these things, you
look practically in vain.  Where in the world did the Church come
up with these things?

     A great example of this, by the way (and it's an example I
use in my class quite often) is this.  For a long time, after I
decided that I was going to be Pagan, I quit going to the
Catholic Church because it didn't interest me.  It might have
been a mistake.  One year while I was at college, I was home for
Spring break (it was Easter) and my mother dragged me along to a
service that happens on the Saturday night right before Easter,
"Holy Saturday" -- which has to be one of the most liturgically
rich occasions of the Church calendar.  (If you want to see it
even richer, take a look at the Orthodox traditions, the Greek
and Russian Orthodox.  They *really* know liturgics.)  At any
rate...

     I had forgotten how the Catholic Church blesses the holy
water that it's going to be using in the coming liturgical year. 
But what happens, roughly, is this.  The holy water font, which
is usually in the porch or vestibule of the church, is brought up
into the sanctuary and placed near the altar.  And at one point
in this particular Mass, the priest walks over to this large
candle which is called the Pascal Candle.  It is in place
throughout the Easter season.  It has little herbs stuck in it
and so forth.  He takes this candle out of its holder, walks over
to the holy water or Baptismal font (which looks, from my point
of view, remarkably like a large cauldron), and holds the candle
over the font, and starts doing *this* with it.  (demonstrates by
plunging the vertical candle in and out of the holy water font) 
(GASPS OF RECOGNITION AND LAUGHTER)

(unidentified):  You're kidding!

Mike Nichols:   I'm NOT kidding.  And after having studied
Paganism, and I saw that, it was like I was seeing it for the
first time.  And I looked to the right and to the left to see if
anybody else, you know, realized what was going on.  I mean, I
thought "Aren't there any *Freudians* in the audience?!?!" 
(LAUGHTER)  There was not one flicker of recognition, not one
flutter of an eyelid!  I could not believe it!

     And I knew there and then that obviously the Catholic Church
had not picked this up from Jesus.  Where had the Catholic Church
learned to bless water?  From us.  And where had the Catholic
Church learned to do a lot of other stuff?  From us.  So, I think
it is richly rewarding for us to take a look at what they have
done in terms of liturgics.

Eldoreth Grey Squirrel:  "Pagans take back the rite!"  (LAUGHTER)

Mike Nichols:  Exactly!!  Exactly.  I like that!  That'll be the
title of my new book!  (LAUGHTER)

Morning Glory:  There's another aspect of that, too, with the
Host, the idea of consuming the body of the God.  Sacred
cannibalism was certainly a factor that this came from.  The
eating of the pressed grains of Dammuzi or Tammuz, the Green Man,

the vegetation god, and the eating of the body of the god, that's
definitely ours.  Jesus was pretty much captured into the Tammuz
cycle, and much that we're working with is still in there.

Mike Nichols:  I absolutely agree.  And you'll notice that in all
this discussion we've only covered the seven basic ecclesial
rites of the Church.  We're not even talking yet about all the
little incidental things the Church calls "sacramentals", like
the blessing of holy objects, the consecration of a church altar,
the consecration of the church building.  Where did the
blueprint, where did the pattern for a lot of these rites come
from?

Morning Glory:  Oh, on that note!  The pattern of the church
building itself.  The idea of having a temple where you did your
worshipping on the ground floor, and the basement is where you
bury your dead, that is a universal ancient custom.  And it's the
same whether it's Chartres Cathedral or the so-called "palace of
Knosis", which is a necropolis, actually.

Otter Zell:  You know, another thing that appears to me to be a
sacrament is the concept of purification.  And somewhere during
the course of what you're saying, I was reminded of a custom of
the purification of people who had returned from a war in ancient
Pagan cultures.  They basically had to pass through the holy
women who, by making love with them, would purify and renew them
and "take the war out of them".  There have been some articles on
this recently.

Morning Glory:  There is a great book out now called "The Woman
Who Slept with Men and Took the War Out of Them".  It's by some
famous feminist that you've all heard of, and I can't remember
her name right now.

Mike Nichols:  Sounds good!  Okay, let's move on into the area of
liturgical theology.  What we've been talking about so far is
liturgical history, the development of liturgical rites, and how
I believe we must focus more attention on that historical
development.  But now let's take a look at liturgical theology,
where we can start splitting theological hairs -- which is always
so much fun!

     There are so many questions that have plagued Pagans for a
long time, and I was *delighted* to find that some of these same
questions had plagued the Christians down through the years.  And
it was fascinating to see what they had to say about it.  Some of
the greatest minds of the Catholic Church from St. Augustan to
Thomas Aquinas, whatever other horrible things they may have done
along the way, had some fascinating things to say about these
issues.

     For example, why are some rituals done only once, like a
seining, whereas other rituals are repeated over and over again?
Take the Magic Circle itself, there doesn't seem to be any limit
on how many times you can do it.  Let's look at one possible
answer.  (But again, I'm gonna throw out more questions than
answers here.)  But one possible answer is that certain rituals,
if properly done (whatever *that* means, and we'll get to that in
2999

a minute), have a *permanent* effect on the person who undergoes
them.  A permanent effect, an "indelible mark" as the old
catechism says, that cannot be erased.

     Now, the question of how a ritual is to be done.  How do you
know if a ritual has been done properly?  For example, does a
ritual have an effect if there are no outwardly observable signs? 
Any of you who have ever performed an initiation rite, I think
this has occurred to you.  What happens if the initiation is all
done, and the person sits there saying "I don't feel any
different.  Am I supposed to?  Has anything happened to me?"  And
you will occasionally find people who have been High Priests and
High Priestesses for quite a few years, who will perhaps talk
more freely about it than others, and among themselves they will
talk about whether an initiation "took".  Did it "take"?  Some of
them will say that after an initiation has been completed, the
rite was performed, the energies are set in motion, but it may
not "take" until after another month, and so forth.  That it may
eventually take, but not right when the initiation was done.  But
the energies are there.

     Would you believe the same questions have been wrestled with
by the Catholic Church?  Especially in the early days of
Christianity when the rite of Baptism was an adult rite, and it
meant that the person was supposed to entirely change their
outward behavior, totally give up certain things, and start
believing certain things.  What if a person went through a
Baptism, which is supposedly a magical rite--  In those days,
Baptism and Confirmation were virtually the same rite, and could
only be done once because it was supposed to be effective the
first time.  Remember the whole question of the "heresy" of the
Re-Baptists was on this precise point.  If a person was baptized,
that supposedly made them a Christian, which would supposedly end
their career of "sin", in the eyes of the Catholic Church.  But
what if they went out and sinned again?  What if they murdered
someone?  Should they get re-baptized?

     The Catholic Church said no, they should not be re-baptized
because one Baptism is sufficient.  The energies are already in
place, but it didn't "take".  But only one per customer for the
rite itself.  Now, it may be that the person was not "spiritually
disposed" to receive the energies generated by the sacramental
rite.  There was some blockage, something stopping them from
being receptive.  We don't know what this is.  That is perhaps
one of the reasons the ritual of Penance developed the way it
did.  Because what do you do with a person who has sinned and yet
wants to come back into the body of the Church?  (By the way,
certain people like the Donatists thought once they've sinned,
they're *out*.  We *don't* allow them back in.)

(unidentified):  My background was Fundamentalist, so I was
baptized in the river at about 12.  And every time I would leave
and come back for a visit, all these people would want me to re-
dedicate myself, come up and be re-baptized.  Now, is that just a
variation of the tradition?  I'm trying to figure this out.

Mike Nichols:  Yes, it is a variation.  When the Protestant
Reformation occurred, one of the things that was most held up to
3000

scrutiny, in fact, was the way the Catholic Church approached the
whole question of sacramental rites.  One of the chief questions
(which we'll get to in a minute) is whether or not the
"worthiness" of the minister is an effective variable in the rite
itself.  Does a priest in a state of sin--  What if a priest has
gone out and murdered somebody?  He is in a state of mortal sin,
supposedly cut off from God and the Church.  What if he then
baptizes somebody?  Is that Baptism sacred?  Is it valid?  Or, as
a Pagan may put it, is the power in the person doing the ritual,
or is the power in the ritual?  I think all of us have wondered
this, right?

     I'll be talking about what some of the various Church
Councils have ruled on matters of liturgical theology in a
minute.  But in this particular instance, the Catholic Church
decided that the power was in the rite, in the ritual itself.  It
didn't matter whether or not the person conducting the ritual was
in a state of grace or a state of sin.  This is one of the things
that Martin Luther took exception to.  He felt that the spiritual
"health", if you will, of the person performing the ceremony was
a variable in how effective the ceremony was.  And I'll show you
in a minute why the Catholic position disagreed with that.

Morning Glory:  The thing about the Fundamentalist attitude about
Baptism, it's not a one per customer attitude.  And a lot of that
has to do with the concept that's called "Baptism of the Holy
Ghost", which is an ecstatic experience that is repeatedly craved
and repeatedly done.  It's like raising the power.  So their
attitude about Baptism is not that this is a sacralizing agent as
much as it is an anointing for the purpose of raising power.

Mike Nichols:   Let me ask you a question based on that.  If a
person undergoes a rite of Baptism and doesn't experience this
influx of whatever, Holy Spirit, then is it assumed that they
were not baptized?

Morning Glory:  Not by the Holy Ghost.  If you don't speak in
tongues, then you didn't get the Holy Ghost.  And that's the sign
of it.  And they'll keep at it until you get it.

Mike Nichols:  Ah!  Okay, very good.  The reason this ran into
problems in the Catholic Church was because of the many priests
who were declared to be heretical, in the Albigensens movement,
the Cathari movement, etc.  What happens if a priest, an
*excommunicant* priest, performs a Baptism?  Is that Baptism
valid?

     The Catholic Church said yes, for a number of reasons. 
First of all, they developed two concepts: validity as opposed to
legality.  The sacrament, or the rite itself, was considered
VALID in that it produced the desired effect on the person.  Even
if a person came from a heretical sect into the Church, they were
not re-baptized.  The Baptism only needed to occur once.  It left
an indelible mark on that person's spirit or soul.  It didn't
have to be re-done, right?  However, that Baptism was ILLEGAL
from the point of view of Canon Law.  The Canon lawyers, the
people who codified the ritual structure of the Catholic Church,
would say that this was a VALID but ILLEGAL (or illicit) rite.
