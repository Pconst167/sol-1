                        Planetary Talismans
                        -------------------

    "Distribute this as thou wilt, HOWEVER if thou profit thereby, then may
  thou be shunned by all, as a centre of pestilence."

                                                 Nehemiah XII 53


    Instructions for making a planetary talisman
    --------------------------------------------

    1)  Decide  which  planet  the operation  falls  under.  Here  are  some
  guidelines :

               Sun - Riches, honour, freedom, great balls of fire !
               Moon - Dreams, religion, secrets, women's 'problems'.
               Mercury - Intellect, science, writing skills.
               Venus - Riches, art, love, SEX.
               Mars - Reckless deeds, violence, BLOODSHED.
               Jupiter - Ambition, morals, justice.
               Saturn - Death, trustworthyness.
               Others - what others ??


    2) Maketh the talisman, using only materials sympathetic to that planet.

               Sun       Gold
               Moon      Silver
               Mercury   Mercury or tin
               Venus     Copper
               Mars      Iron
               Jupiter   Silver or tin
               Saturn    Lead

    It is suggested that  you employ the magic square, and  the sigil of the
  spirit  (for evil  works),  or the  sigil of  the  intelligence (for  good
  workings).

    The rest of the design is left to the ingenium of the magician.


    3) Now  all that  is left  is to charge  the talisman.  It is  better to
  charge the talisman the  same day that it is made; in  any case, make sure
  that the planetary aspects are favourable for the operation.

    Firstly prepare yourself an ink from the following :

                      10 dozen Gall nuts
                       3 oz Green Copperas
                       4 oz Rock Alum

    ( Mix the ingredients into a pot of water, then boil over a fire of vine
  twigs (gathered  in the  full moon  of March). Simmer  for 13  minutes, or
  until it has acquired a slightly  sticky consistency ). If the ingredients
  are out of season then pigeon's blood may be substituted.

    Take a  piece of  silk of the  appropriate colour, and  write on  it the
  names 'Adonay, Ammastius, Anareton, Cosbos, Eloym', whilst reciting Psalms
  viii and  lxxi. After the  talisman has been charged,  be sure to  keep it
  wrapped in this silk, else it will soon lose its efficacy.

    Perform the invocation of the Olympic  Spirit who rules over the planet.
  The method is given  in full in the Isagogue of Arbatel,  in essence it is
  as follows :

    " O Eternal and Omnipotent God, Who hast ordained the whole creation for
  Thy praise and Thy glory, as also for the salvation of man, I beseech Thee
  to send Thy Spirit <insert name>, of the <Solar, Lunar ....> Race, that he
  may instruct  me concerning those things  about which I design  to ask him
  (or  -  that   he  may  bring  me  medicine  against   the  dropsy,  etc).
  Nevertheless, not my will, but Thine  be done, through Jesus Christ, Thine
  only begotten Son, Who is our Lord. Amen. "

    The Olympic Spirits are as follows :

      Sun - Och
      Moon - Phul
      Mercury - Ophiel
      Venus - Hagith
      Mars - Phaleg
      Jupiter - Bethor
      Saturn - Aratron

    Once summoned to  visible appearance it is sufficient to  get the Spirit
  to hold  the talisman and swear  (In the Name  of God) that he  will grant
  your request.  (If you have difficulty  in commanding the Spirit  then you
  may employ  the sigil of that  spirit, this should be  prepared beforehand
  and may be drawn on parchment in blood).

    Discharge the Spirit using the following formula :

    " Forasmuch as thou camest in  peace and quietness, having also answered
  unto my petitions, I give thanks unto  God, in Whose Name thou camest. Now
  mayst thou depart in peace unto thine own order; but return unto me again,
  when I shall call thee by thy name, or by thine order, or by thine office,
  which is granted from the Creator. Amen.

    " ...... Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to
  utter anything before God : for God is in heaven, and thou art upon earth;
  therefore let thy words  be few. For a dream cometh  through the multitude
  of business, and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words."
