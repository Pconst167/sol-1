                           The Charge of the God

       Listen to  the words  of the Horned God, the Guardian of all
        things wild  and free,  and Keeper  of the  Gates of  Death,
         whose Call all must answer:

                         I am the fire within your heart...
                             The yearning of your Soul.
                            I am the Hunter of Knowledge
                          and the Seeker of the Holy Quest
                       I - who stand in the darkness of light
                         am He whom you have called Death.
                     I - the Consort and Mate of Her we adore,
                                call forth to thee.
                             Heed my call beloved ones,
               come unto me and learn the secrets of death and peace.
                              I am the corn at harvest
                            and the fruit on the trees.
                            I am He who leads you home.
                                 Scourge and Flame,
                                 Blade and Blood -
                         these are mine and gifts to thee.

                          Call unto me in the forest wild
                                and on hilltop bare
                        and seek me in the Darkness Bright.
                             I - who have been called;
                                        Pan,
                                       Herne,
                                      Osiris ,
                                     and Hades,
                            speak to thee in thy search.
                                Come dance and sing;
                                come live and smile,
                                    for behold:
                                this is my worship.
                      You are my children and I am thy Father.
                                On swift night wings
                      it is I who lay you at the Mother's feet
                         to be reborn and to return again.
                            Thou who thinks to seek me,
                          know that I am the untamed wind,
                    the fury of storm and passion in your Soul.
                          Seek me with pride and humility,
                      but seek me best with love and strength.
                                For this is my path,
                        and I love not the weak and fearful.
                         Hear my call on long Winter nights
                   and we shall stand together guarding Her Earth
                                   as She sleeps.
