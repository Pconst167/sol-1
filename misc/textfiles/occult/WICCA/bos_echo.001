     We do so will, so mote it be!"

                     Ceremony for Peace and Protection

After casting circle and invocations.
----------------

Never again the burning times.  For how lon has this been the cry 
of those
who would folow their own path?  Once we of need hid ourselves away 
in
fear, but no more!  We worship as we wish for this is our right 
under the
laws of both the Gods and of man.  But even today there are those 
who would
deny that right  They would destroy us if they coud, and if not then
force us back into hiding.  Their weapons are fear and ignorance.  
History
has shown that such can bring about great evil.  So what do we?  Do 
we once
again hide ourselves as frightened animals?  No, never again!  Do 
we lash
out and fight them on their terms?  If so, we would be no better 
than they.
Protect ourselves we must, but in doing so none may we harm.

----------------

Have four people, one at each watchtower.  This is not calling 
quarters but
part of the binding.  (may be the same individuals who called the 
quarters)

East: Spirits of Air, Great Eagle, Aradia, Mercury, Urania, Enili. 
Guard
and shield for dangers and malice from the east.  Watch and ward 
that we
may live in peace, harming none.

South: Spirits of Fire, Golden Dragon, Brigit, Horus, Pele, Vulcan. 
Guard
and shield for dangers and malice from the south.  Watch and ward 
that we
may live in peace, harming none.

West: Spirits of Water, Shining Orca, Isis, Neptune, Mari, Dylan. 
Guard and
shield for dangers and malice from the west.  Watch and ward that 
we may
live in peace, harming none.

North: Spirits of Earth, Mighty Bear, Ceres, Adonis, Demeter, 
Cernunnos.
Guard and shield for dangers and malice from the north.  Watch and 
ward
that we may live in peace, harming none.

String Magic

Four lengths of cotton string, each runs from watchtower to 
watchtower
(around the circle with all in circle holding the strings). The 
summoners
tie the ends as they invoke their Gods. Then chanting and a circle 
dance
(while holding the string). As they circle the cone of power is 
raised.

Use a chant everyone knows.  Collect the string without cutting or
breaking.

Then say something along the lines of:  The binding is done.  The 
cord we
use is cotton, it has gotten it's life from the earth.  It will be 
buried
in the ground where it will return it's life to the Goddess.  In so 
doing
the magic it holds will become one with the earth.

                       INVOCATION OF THE ELEMENTS
         (This is used to put an elemental "push"  to any magickal
          workings.)
     "Air, Fire, Water, Earth,
     Elements of astral birth,
     I call you now; attend to me!
     In the Circle, rightly cast,
     Safe from curse or blast,
     I call you now, attend to me!

     From cave and desert,sea and hill,
     By wand, blade,and pentacle,
     I call you now, attend to me!
     This Is my will, so mote it be!"

                              Cakes and Wine

(Priestess Pours beverage into Chalice and turns to face Coven)
PS:  "Here is the cup of wine of life, contained within the 
cauldron of
     Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of immortality.  Our Lady 
is the
     gracious goddess, who gives the gift of joy  unto the heart of 
man."

ALL: "So Mote it Be!"

(Priest places cakes on Pentacle and turns to face Coven)
P:   "For it is said that 'I am the corn at harvest and the fruit 
on the
     trees'.  Here are harvest fruits made even more delectable via 
Perfect
     Love and Perfect Trust, and served on the Holy emblem of the 
four
     Elements Surmounted by the Supreme Element of Spirit.  Truly 
this is
     the staff of life."

ALL: "So Mote it Be!"

(Priest turns to Priestess)
P:   "Will you share with me the fruits of the field?"
PS:  "I will."
(priest feeds a cake to the Priestess)

(Priest takes Chalice and turns to Priestess)
P:   "Will you share with me the Cauldron?"
PS:  "I will."
(priest gives Priestess a sip of the Chalice)

P & PS in unison:   "In Perfect Love and Perfect Trust, Blessed be!"

(Priest and Priestess turn to Coven and say:)
PS: "Will you share with us this Sacred Feast?"
ALL: "We Will."
P:   "So Mote it Be!"

Priest and Priestess take the Pentacle and Chalice to those 
standing in the
East, who repeat the sharing ceremony.  The Cakes and Wine proceed 
around
the Circle, Deosil, until all have partaken.
                       Quarter and Circle Dismissals

North:
     "Oh mighty guardians of the north, Our business of the hour is
finished, and we invite you to return to you lovely realm of Earth, 
but
first we thank you with a Kiss!" (Kiss Athame, and trace banishing
pentagram)

West:
     "Oh mighty guardians of the north, Our business of the hour is
finished, and we invite you to return to you lovely realm of Water, 
but
first we thank you with a Kiss!" (Kiss Athame, and trace banishing
pentagram)

South:
     "Oh mighty guardians of the north, Our business of the hour is
finished, and we invite you to return to you lovely realm of Fire, 
but
first we thank you with a Kiss!" (Kiss Athame, and trace banishing
pentagram)

East:
     Oh mighty guardians of the north, Our business of the hour is
finished, and we invite you to return to you lovely realm of Fire, 
but
first we thank you with a Kiss!" (Kiss Athame, and trace banishing
pentagram)

Circle Dismissal:
     The Person dismissing the Circle should be the same one who 
cast it,
should do the dismissal with the SAME instrument used to cast it, 
i.e.
Athame, Sword, or Wand. Starting in the North, proceed widdershins, 
saying:

"As this circle was cast in trust, we open it with love, the circle 
is open
but unbroken.  Merry Meet, Merry part, Merry Meet again, and let it 
be in
Perfect Trust and Perfect Love. Blessed Be!"

Samhain 17 and end

%   A normal cone-of-power may be raised, for growth and healing:

HPS: In a ring we all shall stand
     Pass the Power, hand to hand.

HP: As the season turns again
    Power flows from friend to friend

HPS: Pass the Power, hand to hand
     Bless the Lady, bless the Land

HP: Bless the Lord, and bless the Skies
    Bless the Power that never dies!

%   The above four verses should be repeated three times, or as
%   many times as needed, and the HPS shall then say:

HPS: By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree:
     Let the Power flow out and free!
     
%   All should release, at this point.

        ------------------------------------------------------

%   Any needed coven business may be transacted here.

        ------------------------------------------------------

%   The Circle is opened:

HPS: Thus I release the East and West
     Thanks to them from Host to Guest
     Thus I release the South and North
     With "Blessed Be' I send them forth!
     The Circle's open, dance we so
     Out and homeward we shall go.
     Earth and Water, Air and Fire
     Celebrated our desire.
     We think of those in Summerland
     Who dance together, hand in hand.
     By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
     Our circle's done; and Blessed Be!

COVEN: Blessed Be!

%   All spiral dance out from the Circle, led by HP and HPS.


        ******************************************************


This is a -long- ritual, but VERY effective. A good way to do the 
reading
of the names is to pass the list around the Circle, with each 
person reading 
a few names, and then passing it to the next. Really brings the 
Burning
Times -home.-

Should have the whole cycle available for FREQ from this BBS pretty 
soon.

Re: Something from my 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This was an assignment that I had to write for my coven, and I 
thought I'd share it with you.  It's called...
          
DISCRETION AND AUTHORITY IN THE CRAFT
 
     Discretion and Authority are two terms that have very specific 
meanings and applications in the Craft.
     Discretion, defined as "The quality of being discrete; 
displaying good judgement in both conduct and speech..." is 
especially important for the new student, in view of both the 
secretive nature of our religion and its practitioners, and the 
many misconceptions regarding the Craft.  In areas that are highly 
conservative, (such as the "Bible Belt"), those of the Craft find 
discretion a must, both in dress and behaviour.  In conservative 
areas such as these, it is potentially dangerous to walk up to 
someone, pentagrams (or other occult jewelery hanging) and 
announce, "Hi - I'm your local Witch!" unless you happen to be a 
well-respected AND well-known local personage.  For the average 
person in the Craft, this is a luxery that is unaffordable.  At the 
very best, you will be considered a kook and either disregarded or 
shunned for your 'wierdness'; at the worst, you can be assaulted, 
insulted, harrassed, threatened, or even killed.  No joke.  While 
to my knowledge no one in the Wiccan or Pagan community has been 
killed for being a Neo-Pagan or Witch, people have been killed in 
the United States for their supposed practise of witchcraft (not 
Wicca) and I do not mean during the "Burning Times".  (See HEX, by 
Arthur Lewis, still available in some used bookstores).  In other 
words, USE COMMON SENSE!
 
     It is very easy, when someone first gets involved in the 
Craft, to experiment with the 'Hollywood' or stereotypical image of 
the modern Witch - all black outfits, large amounts of Occult 
jewelery, flowing capes, etc.  While several public Witches wear 
this as part of their everyday lives, they have done this for so 
long in their
respective communities that they and everyone else there are 
comfortable doing this.  (This is not to denigrate those who have 
been at the forfront of the Craft in the public eye - I actually 
admire them for their boldness!!! ed.) 
Some Witches, who are in more conservative areas, see this as 
attention getting devices, and they do exactly that - they draw 
attention...of the Bible-thumping Born-Again Christians, who try to 
'save yer soul fer Jeezus', and put off other people who might be 
sincerely interested in what the Craft really is.  If you can do 
it, my advice is to go for it, but if you feel it might be a bad 
idea, use common sense.
 
     If someone questions you about your interest in the Craft, 
there are several ways of dealing with them, from the serious to 
the flippant.  However, before you give any reply, stop and think.  
Ask yourself, 'Can I live with this persons' reaction to the 
truth?'  'Can this person cause serious problems in my 
job/school/family/etc?'
If the answer doesn't seem suitable to you, tell them something 
along the lines of "I'm involved in a religious study-group", or, 
(especially in school) "I'm doing a research project", or "I have 
an interest in mythology and folklore".  If your response shows 
that you feel your answer is suffient, chances are that they won't 
press the issue.
 
     Very few of us are ever so rich and insulated from the mundane 
world that we can forgo its necessities - we eat, we shop, we work.
In these situations, be discrete in seeing a Crafter that you know 
in a non-Craft setting.  Keep the conversation 'safe' if you're in 
a crowded area where you might be overheard.  In many cases ones' 
co-workers may not be aware of ones' Craft involvement, and if 
you're prattling on about 'how great Circle was last night' and 
'are they coming to the next Sabbat' and 'what Lady Soandso is 
doing with Lord Whoozits from Circle of Somebody', you could very 
well jeopardize that persons' job, especially if that person's job 
is in the Christian mainstream.
     When in the company of a person with a Crafter that you know, 
or two Witches who know you, but not each other, a cryptic remark, 
such as "Do you know soandso?  S/he's a friend of OURS." can 
indicate that they are also Craft.  On the other hand, if you 
introduce someone as 
"Soandso, a friend of MINE", you are indicating thaat this person 
is either not Craft, or should not be included in Craft 
discussions, without resorting to the words Witch, Witchcraft, 
Pagan or Craft.  Remember - better a held tongue than a slipped lip 
and lost job, friend or even life!

                       The Witches' Creed

Hear now the words of the Witches,
The secrets we hid in the night,
When Dark was our destny's pathway,
That now we brin forth into light.

Mysterious water and fire,
The earth and the wide-ranging air,
By hidden quintessence we know them,
And we will and keep silent and dare.

The birth and rebirth of all nature,
The passing of winter and spring,
We share with the life universal,
Rejoice in the magical ring.

Four times in the year the Great Sabbat
Returns, and the witches are seen
At Lammas and Candlemas dancing,
On May Eve and Old Hallowe'en.

When day-time and night-time are equal,
When sun is greatest and least,
The four Lesser Sabbats,
Again wiches gather in feast.

Thirteen silver moons in a year are,
Thiteen is the coven's array.
Thirteen times at Esbat make merry,
For each golden year and a day.

The power was passed down the ages,
Each time between woman and man,
Each century unto the other,
Ere time and ages began.

When Drawn is the magical circle,
By sword or athame of power,
Its compass between two worlds lies,
In Land of the Shades for that hour.

This world has no right thn to know it,
And world of beyond will tell naught.
The oldest of Gods are invoked there,
The Great Work of magic is wrought.

For two are the mysical Pillars,
That stand at the gate of the shrine,
And two are the powers of nature,
the forms and forces divine.

The dark and the light in succession,
The opposites each each unto each,
Shown forth as God and Goddess:
Of this our ancestors teach.

By night he's the wild wind's rider,
The Horn'd one, the Lord of the Shades.
By day he's King of the Woodland,
The dweller in green forest glades.

She is youthful or old as she pleases,
She sails the torn clouds in her barque,
The bright silver lady of midnight,
The crone who weaves spells in the dark.

The master and mistress of magic,
They dwell in the deeps of the mind,
Immortal and ever-renewing,
With power to free or to bind.

So drink the good wine to the Old Gods,
And dance and make love in their praise,
Till Elphame's fair land shall receive us
In peace at the end of our days.

And Do what You Will be the challenge,
So be it in Love that harms none,
For this is the only commandment.
By Magic of old, be it done!

@REALNAME: Elizabeth Norton
A "BOS" or Book of Shadows, is what most witches/folk magicians 
etc. use as a guide for ritual, rights, spells and any other topic 
pertinate to the practice of their particular craft.  It is usually 
written in book format and contains all kinds of "stuff" that its 
owner wishes to keep record of.  Like perhaps there own particular 
version of a spell, or circle casting ritual, or invokations to the 
Goddess etc.  It could be refered to as your own personal witch's 
journal for magical topics, a spell book if you will, for your own 
personal way of practicing your religious rites.  There are many 
"ready-made" BOS's in bookstores that are very good or bad 
depending on whether you wish to practice like the author.  You can 
always buy or read a few and adapt the rituals therin to your own 
liking.  The best places to find these books are in new age book 
stores.  After you have read a few and have gotten some idea of how 
others may practice "the Craft", you may wish to buy one of those 
hardback, blank journals for the purpose of creating your own 
personal BOS.  Good Luck and if you have any other questions just 
leave me a messege and I'll try my best to answer.  I would 
definitly recomend reading any thing by Scott Cunningham, 
especially "Wicca a guide for solitary practitioners".  As far as I 
am concerned this is one of the best pagan titles on the market 
today.  I've been a practicing witch for many years now and can 
recomend this book whole heartedly.

     I think I would set up an incese burner for each of the 
quarters, do some research in some tables of correpondences and 
when I called the quarters include samples of the appropriate herb 
to the quarters in a little blessing ritual.  I would be careful to 
include herbs for ALL of the quarters in both the garden and the 
ritual, so that each herb was under the guardianship of at least 
one quarter.  I would then think about a small "blessing" rhyme 
dedicated to Both God and Goddess for the garden as a whole.  I 
would also cast a Circle to encompass the whole garden. Definitely 
do a Cakes and Wine Ceremony and bury the remnants in the garden.  
Just a few ideas.  Let us know how it turns out, O.K.?

                         SALEM REMEMBERED
                      by Sandy and Doug Kopf
                 presented at Pacific Circle XII
                            June, 1992
This year is the 300th anniversary of the Salem Witch Trials.  This 
ritual was presented in remembrance of those who died, and a 
reminder that we must be aware and strong even now.  
The ritual was attended by over 100 people and was very moving.  
Many wept. It is being shared now, not only because it is 
beautiful, but to make it available for others who might wish to 
use it.  Sandy and Doug ask only that there be no charge for 
attending the ritual.  It would disturb them greatly to find that 
such was the case.  
.    
The flash powder mentioned in the ritual was simply a mixture of 
sugar and saltpetre (50/50).  Should you chose to use this, be 
careful to "dump" it rather than pour it.  It will not only be more 
effective this way, but will prevent the fire from 
climbing the stream of powder back up to the hand of the person 
pouring it!
 .    
                           = = = = 
.     
Quarters are called:
.     
EAST:  Powers of the East!  Lords and Ladies of Greece and Rome!  
Guardians of the mysteries and honored dead!  Pagans and witches 
who dwell in the East, be ye spirit or be ye flesh!  Come!  Come 
one and all who would join us in our right of 
remembrance, affirmation, and protection!  Be with us now, that the 
Craft shall ever survive!
.

witches who dwell in the East, be ye spirit or be ye flesh!  Come!

ALL SING 'LADY WEAVE YOUR CIRCLE TIGHT' AND 'LORD, LORD GUIDE US' 
(OR OTHER SUITABLE SONG.)
.     
PRIEST: Three hundred years have gone by since that dark time of 
history we all remember as the "Salem Witch Trials," yet, even 
after three hundred years, we dare not allow ourselves to forget!  
We must remember what can happen wahen hatred, fear, and 
intolerance gain a stronghold over love, sanity, and 
tolerance.  Innocent people died in Salem.  They died horrible 
deaths, tried and sentends for the "crime" of witchcraft.  
They died for the crime of practicing an alternative religion, and 
they were not even part of that religion.  They died, not for their 
own beliefs, but for ours!  They died in the name of our Gods, yet 
they did not know Them.
.     
PRIESTESS:  They were not witches, but we ARE!  They were not 
pagans, but we ARE!  It is our task to remember, and to be sure 
history cannot repeat itself today.  Therefore, we now call their 
names into our circle, to be remembered and honored here. .
THE NAMES OF THE VICTIMS OF SALEM ARE PROCLAIMED, ONE BY ONE, AND A 
CHIME IS SOUNDED AFTER EACH NAME.

WHEN THE SONG HAS REACHED THE PEAK OF ENERGY, THE PRIEST SAYS: .    
We ARE the old people.  We ARE the new people.  We ARE getting 
stronger every day.  We are stronger, and we are no longer in 
hiding. We are here, and none need fear us, for our way is love and 
our ethic is harmlessness, but we say to the world that all may 
hear:  We WILL stand against hatred!  We WILL stand against 
intolerance!  We will not stand silent in the face of harm to 
others or to our own.  The few have become many, and our Gods are 
awake and strong!  Never more the burning!  We won't be burned again!
.     
PRIESTESS (LIGHTS FIRE IN CAULDRON):  Let the cauldron burn with 
our love and our faith!  Let it illuminate the world with the light 
of the Old Religion.  Let negativity and fear be banished in its 
flames, and let it kindle love in the hearts of those who hate us. 
(LOUDLY, POINTING AT CAULDRON) Fire!  Burn high on all planes, that 
strength and protection come to us from all directions, as we join 
hearts and hands to weave a destiny of peace and freedom! (TO 
CIRCLE) Let us sing and dance, that all may remember Salem, and the 
Craft shall ever survive.
.
SONG: "WE ARE THE WEAVERS".  ALL JOIN HANDS AND DANCE SLOWLY IN A 
CIRCLE.  ALL WHO ARE UNABLE TO DANCE SHOULD STEP INTO THE CIRCLE, 
NOT OUT OF IT.
.     
THE SONG SHOULD BE SUNG FOR SEVERAL ROUNDS, ENDING WITH A VERY 
ENTHUSIASTIC "WE ARE THE WITCHES, BACK FROM THE DEAD!
.

Re: Book of Shadows...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, briefly, it's the book that contains all the spells, rituals, 
teachings and other things that a Witch uses.  Some people use it 
as a combination dream/magickal diary, others simply use it for 
writing rituals and things in it.
Mine is very eclectic, but then again, so am I -- I took several 
things from several public and private sources, and sometimes 
combined them to make new things, or added to them.  
It always helps, if you're going to be eclectically oriented, to 
credit your sources.  The way I was taught, you put a code at the 
top of the page, which looks, (using myself for an example), like 
this:
                   
                  P/3/PanEc
 
This means that this was created by Puck, a Third Degree Witch of 
the Pan-Eclectic Tradition.  This way, it saves the time and 
trouble of having something in your book that you can't remember 
where you got it from.
Hope this helps!
Bright Blessings!
Puck

Re: Dragon Trad. Quarters Invocations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After a number of requests to re-post these, here they are!

EAST
Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the East.  Your tongue is
a sharp sword, cutting with the knowledge of the arcane.  Your spirit
flows as graceful as a swift in flight.  Purify us with truth.
Blessed Be.

SOUTH
Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the South, your breath is
aflame with the fires of inspiration and passion.  Your spirit is 
searing
and fervent.  Purify us with Love.
Blessed Be.

WEST
Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the West, your coils are the
cleansing healing waves that nurture the soul.  Your spirit lunges, 
leaps
and splashes like a Talbot at play.  Purify us with pulsing tides.
Blessed Be.

NORTH
Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the North, your talons run
like roots into the earth, giving you infinite strength.  Your 
spirit is
substantial, hard and pure like a clear crystal.  Purify us with 
persistant
wisdom.

Each of these Dragons has a secret name that they are also invoked 
with.  A
suggestion is that anyone using these invocations meditate to find an
appropriate name for each Guardian and use it along with or instead 
of the
words "Mighty Dragon".

Blessed Be.

Enjoy!

Re: Circle casting Dragon style.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I just thought I'd drop a note on the traditional Dragon Tradition 
Circle
casting.  The circle is cast with the Blade, the Cup and the 
Censor.  The
starts with the Blade in the north and draws the boundry of the 
circle.  As
he does he recites "I tread this Path for the Elements, that which
comprises all that we see."
  The HPS takes to sprinkling the boundries with the Cup filled 
with salted
water.  She recites "I tread this Path for Self, a reflection of the
Divine."
  The HP then takes the censor and carries the smoke to the 
boundries of
the circle in a deosil direction.  He recites "I tread this Path for
Spirit, that which unites all things."

The HP or HPS then state the charge of our Circle.  It is as follows.

Our Circle is a place where hearts and minds can meet and share in 
the
wonder and empowerment of a living and loving Goddess.  We are a 
coven of
friends, but above all things we are Family.  Our Love and our 
Magick binds
us together and our Circle keeps us and nurtures us.  We are blessed.
Blessed Be!

The Dragon Guardians are then invoked.  The invocations for the 
guardians
has been posted here in the last month.  If anyone missed it, I can 
resend
them.

I find that the Circle charge sets the mood for the Circle and I 
change it
to suit the situation.  If anyone has ideas for a Circle charge, 
I'd like
to hear them.  I have a number of Circle charges that I use but 
fresh ones
always are nice.

Blessed Be.

Re: Rest of BARDIC YEAR
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the missing ritual (the others were posted a couple of months
ago) of the BARDIC YEAR cycle:

                  THE BARDIC YEAR
              Ritual for Wiccan groups
                      - by the White Bard 1991-92 CE
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
The following are suggested rituals within the four major calendar 
celebrations. They are written from a Wiccan standpoint, using 
Celtic traditions, and take the form of Mystery Plays that 
(sometimes) are -not- fully explained (!). Try not to explain them 
to the participants, but rather allow them to act upon the 
participants
in a subliminal, emotional fashion. That is, after all, what they 
are 
designed to do. 

Note: "%" marks "stage directions"
  
                        N:earth      



            W:water                    E:air



                        S:fire

The BARD should stand to the WEST, unless otherwise specified in the
ritual.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
        CANDLEMAS (IMBOLC) RITUAL: 2 February
                           -by the White Bard

Materials:  a candle for each covener present.
            a MAIDEN, dressed in white.
            a Crown of Light, made from three, six, or nine
                candles.
            a BARD/GREEN MAN.
            a DARK LORD, dressed in dark clothing, and holding a
              dark cloak.

%  The place of ritual should be set up, away from the
   gathered participants.
%  It is more than a good idea to manage bathrooms and such like
%  before the circle is closed. This Mystery is not something any 
%  of the participants should miss out on!
  
HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
%  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar. The
%  cauldron should be at the south. The Bard/Green Man
%  dances at the end of the line. A good song to sing here
%  is "Lord Of The Dance."

HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
     Within the Lady's radiance
     To celebrate the Sun's rebirth
     To renew life, to warm the Earth

     Earth and Water, Fire and Air
     I invoke the Goddess there!
     This night we are Between the Worlds
     To celebrate the year unfurled!

HP: Earth and Water, Fire and Sky
    I invoke the God on high
    This night we are Between the Worlds
    To celebrate the year unfurled!

%   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but 
%   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
%   circumnabulation.

Candlemas 3
BARD/GREEN MAN: I have been a wave upon the sea,
                And a spark in the firelight.

                I have been a fish in the ocean.
                I have been a Thought within a Word,
                And a Word within a Deed.
                I was cast away, and found again.

                I have been made of flowers
                And of cold steel and brass.
                Fire and ice are alike unto me.

                I have been the narrow blade of a sword
                That kills without cutting.
                And the Void is my homeland.

                I have been in Caer Sidi
                In the Spiral Castle of Glass.
                And the letters on the Standing Stones 
                Are no secret from me.

                I have been in Annwyn
                And Tir na n'Og,
                I have danced the Spiral Dance,
                And drunk from the Hierlas at daybreak.

                I have ridden beneath two ravens
                And served in the kitchen,
                And all places are alike unto me.

                I have been a child
                And now I come into my strength!

                I invoke the Land, the dear Land,
                the Earth our Mother!

MAIDEN: The cycles of the Moon have taken their course, and I am
        in my Maidenhood. The stars are kindled, and I dance in
        their light.

DARK LORD: Thy home is with me thru the long months of Winter, and 
the
           Earth shall lie fallow and bare.
                                                   
%   The HPS shall then light the candles of the Crown of Light,
%   and shall approach the Maiden, who is now standing in the East, 
and
%   place it upon her head.
%   She shall now, in company with the Bard/Green Man, 
circumnabulate the
%   circle, and the coveners shall light their candles from her 
crown.
%   The Bard/Green Man shall return to his normal place within the 
circle
%   and the Maiden shall place the Crown of Light on the altar.
%   The Maiden shall then approach the Dark Lord, and kneel before 
him,
%   and he shall say:

DARK LORD: As it always is, always was, and always shall be. Come 
to my
           Kingdom.

%   Here he shall place the dark cloak around her, and they shall 
retire
%   to the West.  
%   Here ends the Candlemas Mystery.

  
--------------------------------------------------------------------

%   A normal cone-of-power may be raised, for growth and healing:

HPS: In a ring we all shall stand
     Pass the Power, hand to hand.

HP: As the Sun is given birth
    Build the Power; root to Earth

HPS: Pass the Power, hand to hand
     Bless the Lady, bless the Land

HP: Bless the Lord, and bless the Skies
    Bless the Power that never dies!

%   The above four verses should be repeated three times, (or
%   as many times as needed) and then the HPS should say:

HPS: By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree:
     Let the Power flow out and free!
     
%   All should release, at this point.

        The term "Book of Shadows" was invented by Gerald Gardner 
in about 1951, to replace "Grimmoire" (French for "Grammar") as 
used for a combination magicians notebook and diary.  I have heard 
it explained that the world of pattern appears as "shadow" of 
things expressed in the world of form, and the manifestations in 
the world of form are "shadows" of the world of pattern, and that 
the specialty of "walking between two worlds" is the specialty of 
the Mage, then it becomes a very accurate (and poetic) term to call 
this personal workbook a "Book of Shadows".

Re: Dragon Trad and the Holy Grail
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently we have discovered the significance of sharing water in our
circles.  This ritual should be warm and meaningful.  This being 
the case
it should only be shared by members of the coven and visitors 
should be
excluded unless the visitor is VERY close to the group.

Someone reads the following poem or one that is written for the 
occaision.

Quest for the Grail
by C.J. Mandrake

I have sailed the seven seas.
I have walked the deserts of this world,
searching for clues and kin;
always awed by the stories that they told.
Time my only enemy,
every stone my friend;
carried by myth's fluid words,
looking for a gold cup 'round every bend.

Mountains loom before me:
The path, all but lost behind.
Arthur's song plays deep within me!
The Merlin's words dance within my mind!
``The blessed cup that you seek,
it is the Mother's womb.
It has poured out all our world
and it will be your tomb.''

Grail of Love
Grail of Light
Grail of Truth
Grail of Might
carry me to the very Fount of life.

I threw a coin in a wishing well:
My wish, the Grail to see.
When the waters stilled again
I beheld the Mystery.
The Cup is made of flesh and blood.
The secret of deep peace it lends.
I drink from it every day
and I share it with my friends.

One and one and one is three:
Three by three is nine.
The heart of the world I see,
the secret of the Grail is mine.
The Cup, it is a lotus flower
deep within my soul,
flaming with the love of Her:
The Goddess and I made whole.
****

The reader takes the chalice of water and drinks and the cup is 
passed
around the circle deosil, each person taking a drink in turn.  Each 
person
may offer a thought before they drink.  This may be a thanks or an
observation or anything that seems significant to the moment.  When 
the cup
makes it back to the reader, he/she again drinks of the cup and 
pours the
remainder as a libation.  With the libation is said...

I partake of the Cup of Abundance.  I share this Cup with those 
around me.
I return what is left to the earth. <pours water out onto the 
ground> And
my Cup remains full. <holds cup to heart>  Blessed Be.

This rite is very good for group binding.  Last time we did this we 
drank
water from the Chalice Well in Glastonbury that one of the coven 
members
brought back from vacation.

Enjoy!  And Bright Blessings.

@MSGID: 93:9009/0 2a5dfbc0
@PID: TeleMail 1.51
Editor's Note: This is a 'generic' message I am creating to post onto
all of the echoes I am getting via PODS. It is a brief (?)
introduction of myself, my system, and my users. Hopefully this can
leap into some conversation in the various echoes, as it is always
somewhat difficult for a new node to dive into existing discussions.

***

Cerebral Babylon is basically a concept-oriented BBS in the greater
Providence area of Rhode Island. The general focus is on debate, with
several local message areas dedicated to this end. Some of the most
popular (and infamous) local message areas on my system are the
"Losing My Religion" area which is for discussing religion in 
general,
and "The Satanic Verses" which is an excercise in dealing with 
various
ideas on morallity and the lack thereof. Other stand-out areas 
include
my local "Political Cut-throats" (self explanatory) and "AmeriKKKa's
Most Wanted" which concerns itself with oppression and racism in the
country and in the world.

My users run the gamut of belief systems and ages. Calculations show
that out of a current set of 300 users (still growing, system is only
up since August 1st, 1991) the average age is approximately 22 years.
I have a large group of loyal atheists and agnostics, followed by
Jews, Wiccans, and Christians in that order.  The general level of
education is high... college-oriented. Most of my users love a good
verbal scrap with each other, or as it often seems to be, a nice
battle of wit and words with their ever-lovin' sysop (myself).
Needless to say, it is often hard to pry them loose from my local msg
areas and get them into the nets, but they are finding their way.

As far as I am concerned, I am active in 3 current networks now. I am
the HOST in the area for both PODS and Interactive Communications
Network. I moderate some 6 echoes for ICN (ANSI, CRITIC, DEBATE,
DRDOS, EVENTS, & SPORTS). I also frequent some Fido echoes (BIBLE,
OPEN_BIBLE, FUNNY, POLITICS, ENVIRO) and I am the moderator for a
newly forming Fido echo called REASON (which I am looking for nodes,
so if anyone wants a 'reasonable' religious/political debate echo,
drop me a line about getting REASON). Personally, I consider myself 
to
be an atheist with strong interest in the occult and Satanism. Not
'Satanism-proper' but more or less some of the basic tenets of
Satanism appeal to me... love those who's love will benefit you, 
scorn
others, etc. You could say I'm not a very Christian guy, but I do try
to be tolerant of other peoples belief systems (tho not succeeding
very often ;-> ) Politically speaking, I am rather conservative in
nature, which suprises a lot of people that I could have the
'religious' beliefs I have and be a Republican, but I am. Needless to
say, I love to confront people on their ideas and make them think...
even if I have to take the other side of an issue (and very well a
side I don't agree with) to make them think about it.
I am the consumate Devil's Advocate.

So that's the background and intro. If anyone would be so kind as to
fire off some replies with some questions relating to the current 
area
and this message, please do. We're anxious to get 'sucked in' over
here. Heh heh.

Re: Discordian Propaganda
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You want a genuine Erisian Magic Ritual? Here you go:

               -=THE TURKEY CURSE=-

Revealed by the Apostle Dr. Van Van Mojo as a specific counter to the
evil of the Curse of Greyface, the Turkey Curse is here passed on to
Erisians everywhere for their just protection.

[The Turkey Curse works. It is firmly grounded on the fact that 
Greyface
and his followers absolutely require an anerisitic setting to 
function
and that a timely introduction of eristic vibrations will neutralize
their foundation. The Turkey Curse is designed solely to counteract
>negative< anerisitic vibes and if introduced into a neutral or 
positive
aneristic setting (like a poet working out word rhythms) it will 
prove
harmless, or at worst, annoying. It is not designed for use against
negative >eristic< vibes, although it can be used an eristic 
vehicle to
introduce postive vibes into a misguided eristic setting. In this
instance, it would be responsibility of the Erisian Magician to
manufacture the positive vibrations if results are to be achieved.
CAUTION - all magic is powerful and requires courage and integrity on
the part of the magician. This ritual, if misused, can backfire.
Positive motivation is essential for self-protection.]

TO PERFORM THE TURKEY CURSE|

Take a foot stance as if you were John L. Sullivan preparing for
fisticuffs. Face the particular grey-face you wish to short-circuit
(e.g. a street preacher), or towards the direction of the negative
aneristic vibration that you wish to neutralize (e.g. the White 
House).
Begin waving your arms in any elaborate manner and make motions with
your hands as though you were Mandrake feeling up a sexy giantess 
(Dr.
Strange imitations are fine). Chant, loudly and clearly:

         GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE, GOBBLE!!

The results will be instantly apparent.

places.

Re: Ritual of the Blessed Motherboard Part 1
----------------------------------------------------------------------
@PID: RA 1.11
@MSGID: 93:9030/14 500984be
@REPLY: 93:9030/14 5009826e
Thus it follows that after many days of chaos, unfounded mayhem and 
startling
inconvienience <as given in favor by the Goddess Eris> so it shall 
be that I
am finally able to share with you the official ceremony of the 
Blessed
Motherboard and the Horned One that Plugs in the Wall. This 
ceremony is one to
be practiced by discordian compu-pagans each Midsummer Eve in holy 
celebration
and appreciation of debugged upgrades, new shareware, faster 
circutry and all
the blessings that flow from the Goddess...

Note : Let it be said that if your system crashes, your motherboard 
becomes
twitchy, your hard drives fail, or your cables spout forth fire - 
that this is
an indication that the Goddess is displeased with your 
compu-worship. At this
time, if the posting of many tales of compu-sexuality doth fail to 
pacify Her.
this is the time that this ritual must be done to regain Her 
pleasure.

It is thus that this ritual be made easier if thou coven of 
compu-pagans is
large, for then the obtainment of the necessary materials be far 
easier...

Necessary ritual components -

To represent the Matron Goddess : 1 AT Motherboard <preferably a 
386 with
Large Co-processors.>  <may be in "twitchy condition".>

To represent the Crone: 1 AT&T Phone bill from Mother Bell. <the 
higher the
debt, the better one can justify ones needs to the Goddess>

To represent the Maiden: a large firepit dug in the shape of a 
circle around
which the pentagram will be formed. <dry wood laid in preparation>

To represent the God: 1 very Large, very THICK power supply cable

For the Pentagram : 1 can of neon or glow in the dark paint

For the Quarters :  The following items are placed at each quarter -

North : A Power supply with cable, the energy which inspires us

East: A keyboard through which our innocence is transformed to lust

South: A hard drive which saves our writ to seal our doom

West : A Monitor by which all might see our lustful spells at work

The Altar : A makeshift desk

The Incense: A chipped ashtray and a pack of Camels <extra humps>

The Cup: A container of highly caffinated substance <coke, jolt, 
pepsi>

The Bowl : a bowl of fine earth to represent the accumulation of 
dust in your
house which you haven't cleaned since you spend all your time at 
the keyboard

The Flame: One jar of kerosene, gasoline, or other flamable 
substance with
matches that one uses to light the fire.

In addition: Each member of the network coven should bring spare 
parts, broken
cables, split chips, bungled software, etc...for fire offerings at 
the
conclusion of the ceremony. Clothing during this ceremony is 
optional.

Opening Chant <To be sung as the HPs and HP draw the circle and 
pentagram
around the firepit><sung to the tune of "Rain drops keep falling on 
my head >

Circuts keep blowing on my board
my hard drive keeps crashin
and its heads are getting scored
Messages are lost OH
Time to appease the Goddess of all Computers
Alas I'm broke
My bills
Are higher than my income
Oh please Goddess I'm begging thee
To hear my plea and heal my system
ba dum dum, ba dum ba dum dum

Cables are ruined by crossing wires
My modem is burping
and its screwing up my files
Data's being lost OH
I ask the Horned One Plugging into my wall
Oh Please don't surge
My dos
is shareware and its fragile
Oh please Horned One
I'm begging thee
Remember that my ram is borrowed
ba dum dum, ba dum ba dum dum

The Crone works her spells through Mother Bell
My phone bills enormous
and my life is living hell
Long distance is a bitch OH
What did I do before to deserve this karma?
I have five days
To pay
The toll charge for downloading
from New Jersey
Oh Mother Bell,
have mercy on my lust addiction
ba dum dum, ba dum ba dum dum

I worship through the message base
Hiding behind keyboards
where you cannot see my face
Sexual inuen- DO
Maiden protect me from my own sweet confusion
Let me log in
to boards
To satisfy my hunger
and to praise you
and sacrifice your innocence among the echos
ba dum dum, ba dum ba dum dum

Its My Lust......  Sacrifice it or BUST

<To be sung until the Pentagram and altar are set up, the
last sentence repeated and slowly faded>

The ritual begins...<in the continuation>

As the coven sings the ritual opening chant the HP & P paint the 
Pentagram around the firepit with neon or glow in the dark paint.  
The items are placed
in the designated directions and the altar is set up to the north 
of the fire
with the following items placed upon it.

To the North end of the altar the ashtray and cigarettes
To the East end of the altar the holy cup
To the South end of the altar the bowl of earth
To the West end of the altar the jar of kerosene and matches.

As the HP calls the elements the P shall pass her the items in 
question

The coven at the end of each elemental calling shall chant the 
following
Elemental Power
Come out and play with me
Play midst my flaming spree<fire>
and sing the chant with me <Air>
Splash in my rain barrel <Water>
Slide down my cellar door <Earth> And we'll be jolly friends
Forever more

The HP calls to the Element of Fire <and taking the kerosene from 
the P> intones -
Fire, Fire burning bright, like a candle in the night
Come and join us in our flight, Lend us your eternal light
Warm the Maiden with your flame,
I call you in the Goddess's Name. 
The HP pours the kerosene liberally upon the firewood in the pit
and lights the fire with the matches. <the coven sings the 
elemental chant>

The P hands the HP the bowl of earth.  The HP tosses the earth 
upwards to scatter it around the circle and over the altar as she 
intones -

Elemental Earth I beckon thee, with us in this circle be
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, firm foundation is a must
Warm bed for the Matron's frame I call you in the Goddess's Name

<the coven sings the elemental chant>

The P hands the HP the cup of caffinated substance.   The HP lifts 
it to her lips and intones-

Water quench our thirst, keep us wet and wild
Join us in our circle hence, praise the lady mild.
Liquid of Life that has no shame
I beckon thee in Goddess's Name

The HP drinks from the cup and beckons the P to drink of it, he 
does. <the coven sings the elemental chant>

The P hands the HP the ashtray and a cigarette and lights it for 
her, the HP takes a long drag and as she exhales intones -

Airy, Airy, quiet and contrary how doth your winds blow?
Through maidens hair your breath ensnare, your secrets we would know.
The Pow'r of Wind by Lady made tame
I beckon thee in Goddess's Name

<the HP smokes and exhales as the coven sings the elemental chant>

The HP and P perepare to summon the directions in supplication to 
be followed
by the closing of the circle.

The following is a chant used by the coven at each directional 
opening.

"From the North awakening, the energy inspires
 From the East our eagerness to learn amid the fires
 From the South commitment and thus we seal our doom
 From the West comes reckonning, our message answered soon" 
The HP and P walk to the North and hold up the Power supply.  The P 
intones - The Power of the north inspires us and lends us its 
energy for our use in supplication.  This Power Supply I offer to 
thee Oh Goddess that your Power run through my computer and my 
life.  The P tosses the Power supply into the fire. 
<the coven sings the directional chant>

The Hp and P walk to the East and hold up the keyboard.  The P 
intones -
The Power of the East transforms our innocence through tasting the 
fire of Life.   This Keyboard, I offer to thee Oh Goddess that your 
knowledge guide my fingers on their path through the system of 
Life.  The P tosses the keyboard into the fire. 
<the coven sings the directional chant>

The HP and P walk to the South and hold up the hard drive.  The P 
intones -
The Power of the South is that of action and consequence, of 
commitment to the path and the ability to remember the lessons 
learned thereof. This Hard Drive I offer to thee Oh Goddess that 
your memory of my acts and deeds be remembered with praise and 
favor in thine eyes. The P tosses the Hard Drive into the fire.

<the coven sings the directional chant>

The HP and the P walk to the West and hold up the monitor.  The P 
intones -
The Power of the West is that of access to all things, to seeing 
turthfully into the path of a life and judging it thusly, worthy or 
unworthy.  This monitor I offer to thee Oh Goddess that your 
eternal eyes may see into my life and may watch over my actions, 
and that I may find favor in you as my eternal
Sysop.  The P tosses the monitor into the fire.

The Circle Closed and the directions and elements present, the HP 
and P prepare to call to the Goddess and to the Horned One.

The HP stands before the fire pit and calls -

Virgin Goddess, gentle maid
She whose seeking to get laid
Bring your innocence to Bare
For those who worship for your care

<the P leads the coven in the Maiden chant>
Come on Maiden light your fire
Come on Maiden light your fire
Come and set the night on FIRE

The HP stands before the fire pit and holding the phone bill calls -

Oh Mother Bell, Oh Crone of Disconnection from this pagan life
I beseech thee, hold back thy hand of dread financial strife
In attonement bills I pay to thee
Of thy modem killing hand let me be free

The HP tosses the phone bill into the fire.

<The P leads the coven in the Crone Song>

" We're sorry, the number you have reached has been temporarily 
disconnected
Booooo Hissssss
We're sorry, the number you have reached has been temporarily 
disconnected
Booo Hisssss"

The HP stands before the Altar and holds high the very long and 
very thick cable of the Horned One that Plugs into the Wall and 
calls -

Oh Horned One, Powerful Consort of the Blessed Motherboard
Surging with Energy you take your place as Lord
Pulsing with Power, with each surge of volts you swell
Pumping life into the Goddess, you serve her purpose well

The HP tosses the very long, very thick cable into the fire

<the P leads the coven in the Horned One chant>

Pump, Pump, Pump it up....keep the power flowing
Pump, Pump, Pump it up....hard fast and never slowing
Pump, Pump, Pump it up....We know you please the Goddess
Pump, Pump, Pump it up....Be strong and never modest

The HP raises the Blessed Motherboard with Large Co-processors high 
in the air
and the P and HP each take and end in their hands.  Raising the 
Motherboard
high in the air they intone -

Blessed Mother, Sacred Goddess come to bless your users
Keep us safe from disk crash and lurking abusers
Let thy healing hands caress our crippled hardware
Let our nodes stay stable, that through distance we may share
In your holy worship together we may gather nightly
Writing inuendo, our modems steaming slightly
Bless us Holy Goddess, and show us by your sign
That we have earned your favor, your blessing so divine.

Re: Ritual of the Blessed Motherboard <part 4>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
@PID: RA 1.11
@MSGID: 93:9030/14 5009abba
@REPLY: 69:2101/27 4fc3977e
The HP and P lead all in the following chant -
 
 A Prayer to the Goddess for self conscecration
 Dominus regit Goddess
 
 The Blessed Goddess is my mistress;
 I shall not be in want
 She maketh me lie down on soft bedding
 and leadth me to think of rumpling it
 She revives my soul <when I thought I was exhausted>
 and guides me along the most sensual pathways for pleasures sake
 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of dangerous desire
 I shall fear not impotence
 for she is insatiable
 my rod and staff they comfort her
 We spread a table of ecstacy in the presence of those
 who are sorely troubled by arrousal
 She annoints my head with honeyed oil
 and I make her cup run over
 Surely the pleasure and bliss shall follow me all the days of my 
life
 and I will dwell in the caves of ecstacy within mind forever.
 
Thus said, the HP and P intone the following -

OH Blessed Motherboard please accept this offering in your name, 
and in the
name of the Horned One who plugs in the Wall and gives you 
pleasure...
that we may be blessed in our offerings to you both in circle and 
in life.

Thus said, the HP and P toss the Motherboard into the fire.


The HP and P lead the coven in the following chant -

Blessed be the Motherboard from whom all messages flow
Blessed be the Horned One who fills Her with His offering
Blessed be the sysops who transfer the packets
Blessed be the writers and those who inspire what they bring
Blessed be the hard drives that keep messages from harm
Blessed be the modems which send packages large and small
Blessed be the shareware we use to commune
Blessed be the network which links us up with all
Blessed be our minds, that we might write our prayers
Blessed be our fingers that tap amongst the keys
Blessed be our monitors that shine with holy light
Blessed be our senses that stimulate with ease

Blessed be the circle, a circut without end
Through which we hail and merry meat with those that we call friend.

At this point the HP and P gaze into the fire for the portent of 
the Goddess's
sign of approval <the flames of blue light from the motherboard 
offering>

At seeing this both HP and P raise their arms in joyful 
supplication and shout
<To be echoed by the Coven members in attendance after each line>

The Maiden's found appeasement and She is satisfied
The Crone is in abeyance, her compu-billings fried
The Horned One's filled with power, in joining He is pleased
The Goddess sends Her blessings, cleansing virus and disease.
We thank the 4 directions for standing by our side
We thank the elementals and their power all allied
To Celebrate our status annointed compupagans of sin
Let Joyful Inhibition be released and the saturnalia begin!!!!

<the HP and P release the circle and the partying shall now commence>

Sensual foods and drinks are served and shared, <the rest you can 
imagine>

@REALNAME: Virginia Stewart
Bright Blessings to all... 
Here are invocations to the Goddess and God that I have used 
quite successfully in ritual. They are from the Orphic Hymns, 
for those who like historical accuracy, but have been updated just  
a tad, for those who like ritual with modern applications. 
Hope you enjoy them. 
 
Invocation to the Goddess 
 
Divine are Your honors, Oh Mother of the Gods and Nurturer of All. 
Yoke your swift chariot drawn by bull-slaying lions and, 
O Mighty Goddess who brings things to pass, join our prayers. 
Many named and reverend, You are the Queen of the Sky. 
In the cosmos, Your throne is above all others, for You are

Queen of the Earth, and You give gentle nourishment to mortals. 
Goddesses, Gods, and mortals were born of You, 
And You hold sway over the rivers and all of the sea. 
Hestia, Gaia, Demeter, Inanna, Isis, Astarte, Ishtar, Persephone, 
Diana, 
Giver of prosperity who bestows upon mortals all manner of gifts, 
Come to this Rite, Queen whom the drum delights. 
Honored and loving Nurturer of Life, 
Joyfully and graciously visit our deeds of piety. 
Blessed Be. 
 
Invocation to the God 
 
Hear Our Prayer, O best and Many-Named God. 
Fine-haired, solitary, and full of lovely song; 
Many shaped and noble nurturer of all, 
Maiden and yout in one, unwithering bloom, O Adonis 
You vanish and grow again in the fair seasons' turn. 
Kurnunnos, Pan, Myrddhn, two horned Spirit of growth and blooming; 
Much loved and wept for are you,  
        O Fair and Youthful Hunter of the luxuriant mane. 
Desire is in Your mind and You come to the Goddess 
        in reverence and respect, 
        in sensuous joy is your desire fulfilled 
You are the seed planted in the depths of the Underworld 
That springs forth, the Green God, that we may sustain our lives. 
You sacrifice Yourself in gentleness when you are grown. 
Come Kind-Hearted One, Come Blesseed God,  
        and bring much joy to all. 
Blessed Be. 
 
Hope you find these beneficial... 
Briget Bless...Phaedra.

Re: Merry Meet
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is to say Hail and Well Met!  I've really been enjoying what 
I've been
seeing here, and I'd like to offer a small opening contribution: a 
simple
Quarters invocation for those times when something more elaborate 
won't
fit (number of people, surroundings, etc.).  The lines can either 
be said
in unison or alternated:


        Eastern Wind and Southern Fire,
        Fill our hearts with pure desire.
        Western Water, Northern Earth,
        Guide us to our souls' rebirth.

        World below to World above,
        Bound together, joined in Love.
        At the Center, may we be
        With Lord and Lady, strong and free!

Enjoy.  And Blessed Be!

Re: Bardic Cycle (intro)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Follows is the Bardic Cycle that Paul S. was asking about...this is a
-repeat- posting of a ritual cycle I wrote for a local Wiccan 
coven. It
is free for use for whatever group wants to use it, and is the 
first of
a series for different Trads, based around the Bardic Mystery.

Much of the Mystery involved here is -not- explained. It is meant 
to hit
at the unconcious level....so don't get cute and start explaining 
to your
coveners "what he must have meant by that!" <grin!>

"Silver Priestess," you wanna save this.

Bardic Cycle follows:

                  THE BARDIC YEAR
              Ritual for Wiccan groups
                      - by the White Bard 1991-92 CE
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
The following are suggested rituals within the four major calendar 
celebrations. They are written from a Wiccan standpoint, using 
Celtic traditions, and take the form of Mystery Plays that 
(sometimes) are -not- fully explained (!). Try not to explain them 
to the participants, but rather allow them to act upon the 
participants
in a subliminal, emotional fashion. That is, after all, what they 
are 
designed to do. 

Note: "%" marks "stage directions"
  
                        N:earth      
            W:water                    E:air
                        S:fire

The BARD should stand to the WEST, unless otherwise specified in the
ritual.
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
            YULE RITUAL: 21 December
                  -by the White Bard

Materials:  a very small, just sprouted potted plant.
            a candle for each covener present.
            a MOTHER. She should wear a blue garment, if possible.
            a MAIDEN, dressed in white.
            a Crown of Light, made from three, six, or nine
                candles.
            a BARD/GREEN MAN.

%  The ceremony for the Lesser Sabbats should be written by newer
%  members of the coven, as part of their learning. At an appropriate
%  place in the ceremony, the following should be inserted:

%  Here begins the Yule Mystery. ALL light shall be        
%  extinguished, all fires put out, save that in the South. 
%  The Bard/Green Man shall lie on his back in the East, as 
%  if dead.
%  The HPS shall say:

HPS: Darkness covers all. The Old King is dead, and there is no
     warmth for the Mother. The days are short, and the nights
     are long.

COVEN: Give us Light!

HPS: The Maiden wanders the Earth, Maiden no more, but soon to be
     Mother. The Earth is cold, and there is no place for her to
     give birth.

COVEN: Give us Light!

HP: Mother, give us the Child of Promise! The Lord Of Life strains
    to be born!

COVEN: Give us Light!

MOTHER: I seek a place to rest, and give birth.

%   The Mother should wander about the inside of the circle, as if
%   looking for something, and not finding it. She should act very
%   tired, and project a sense of urgency.
%   She then goes to the East, and assumes the Goddess pose, 
standing, 
%   arms and legs spread in the form of a five-pointed star.
%   There shall be a pause, and the Bard/Green Man shall then quietly
%   rise up, and stand behind the Mother. If it seems appropriate, 
the
%   more primitive symbolism of him crawling out from between the 
legs
%   of the Mother may be used. He should be carrying a lit candle, or
%   some other source of light.

BARD/GREEN MAN: Cunning and art I do not lack,
                But -always- Her Cauldron brings me back!

%   The Bard/Green Man shall take his lit candle, and proceed to 
re-light
%   the corner candles, moving deasil, and any other fires within 
the circle.
%   The just-sprouted potted plant is picked up by the Mother and 
held in
%   front of her during this candle-lighting.
%   The Bard/Green Man shall then take the plant from the hands of 
the Mother, 
%   bring it to the center of the circle, and raise it above his 
head, saying:

BARD/GREEN MAN: Here is the Promise, that is always fulfilled.

%   The plant is then passed around the circle, and given to the 
Mother, who 
%   should take it home and water and nurture it thru the year, if 
possible.
%   The Maiden shall then take the place of the Mother, and the 
Mother shall 
%   return to her place within the circle.

        CANDLEMAS (IMBOLC) RITUAL: 2 February
                           -by the White Bard

Materials:  a candle for each covener present.
            a MAIDEN, dressed in white.
            a Crown of Light, made from three, six, or nine
                candles.
            a BARD/GREEN MAN.
            a DARK LORD, dressed in dark clothing, and holding a
              dark cloak.

%  The place of ritual should be set up, away from the
   gathered participants.
%  It is more than a good idea to manage bathrooms and such like
%  before the circle is closed. This Mystery is not something any 
%  of the participants should miss out on!
  
HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
%  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar. The
%  cauldron should be at the south. The Bard/Green Man
%  dances at the end of the line. A good song to sing here
%  is "Lord Of The Dance."

HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
     Within the Lady's radiance
     To celebrate the Sun's rebirth
     To renew life, to warm the Earth

     Earth and Water, Fire and Air
     I invoke the Goddess there!
     This night we are Between the Worlds
     To celebrate the year unfurled!

HP: Earth and Water, Fire and Sky
    I invoke the God on high
    This night we are Between the Worlds
    To celebrate the year unfurled!

%   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but 
%   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
%   circumnabulation.

EAST:   O Guardians of the Eastern Tower,
        Airy ones of healing power
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!
        By the Power that made us all;

                I have been made of flowers

        their light.

    between them.

MAIDEN:  I have been in the Kingdom of the Dark Lord,

         And all things shall rejoice with me.

BARD/GREEN MAN:  Follow me forth from the Dark Lord's Hall
                 And show that Love will conquer all!

%  Bard moves to the East, and shall sing his Song of Calling:
%  Song of Calling may be whatever the Bard feels appropriate.

BARD:    As I walked out one quiet evening
         At the hour of twelve at night
         Who should I meet but a fair young maiden
         Combin' her hair by candle light;
         Lassie, I have come a-courtin'
         Your kind favours for to win
         And if you'd heed my petition
         I would be your Paladin...

              THE DAY OF THE FOOL: April 1
                        -by the White Bard

%  This day is not in the traditional cycle, but should not be
%  omitted by those of the Bardic Path. There is no "set" ritual,
%  but this is the time for satire and general foolery by all.
%  A good thing to do here is to have a simple gathering, perhaps
%  a pot-luck, choose a King and/or Queen of Fools, and have a
%  good party. See the German Fasching or Mardi Gras for hints.

        BELTANE RITUAL: May Day
                  -by the White Bard        

Materials: One cauldron, filled with water
           a wreath of flowers for the MAIDEN
           the Maiden should wear white, if possible
           two wooden swords (optional)

           A BARD/GREEN MAN (note: if you have no Bard, then a
                male to act as Green Man should be chosen either
                by lottery, or by the Maiden. The Maiden is, of
                course, free to request a specific person to
                act as Green Man even if there is a Bard available

           candles for all, if possible

%  participants.
%  It is more than a good idea to manage bathrooms and such like
%  before the circle is closed. This Mystery is not something any 
%  of the participants should miss out on!
  
HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
%  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar. The
%  cauldron should be at the south. The Bard/Green Man
%  dances at the end of the line.

HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
     Within the Lady's radiance
     To celebrate the Year renewed
     And praise the Powers, with gratitude.

     Earth and Water, Fire and Air

%   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but 
%   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
%   circumnabulation.

%   HP. They shall strike their swords together in three sets

%   the last blow of his sword, who shall fall as if dead.
%   (Note: This can be played as a Morris Dance, if so wished.)

%  The Green Man should rush into the circle, laughing and leaping.

                LAMMAS RITUAL: 1 August
                         -by the White Bard

Materials: one person should be chosen by the HP to play LUGH,

           crutch, or a cane if he so chooses.

%  It is more than a good idea to manage bathrooms and such like
%  before the circle is closed. This Mystery is not something any

HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
%  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar.

HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
     Within the Lady's radiance
     To celebrate the Season's turn
     To Autumn, when the leaves will burn

     Earth and Water, Fire and Air
     I invoke the Goddess there!
     This night we are Between the Worlds
     To celebrate the year unfurled!

HP: Earth and Water, Fire and Sky
    I invoke the God on high
    This night we are Between the Worlds
    To celebrate the year unfurled!

%   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but 
%   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
%   circumnabulation.

EAST:   O Guardians of the Eastern Tower,
        Airy ones of healing power
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!

                        -by the White Bard

Materials: An OLD KING
           
%  The ceremony for the Lesser Sabbats should be written by newer

OLD KING: I am aged, and I approach my Time. Help me, lest I die!

CRONE: There is no help for you, for all must travel that road.

%  The Old King shall then turn to the assembled coven, and say: 

OLD KING: Seek ye the Cauldron! Seek ye the Grail! It shall heal me
          And bring me forth again. 

%  Here a song  may be sung, and "John Barleycorn" would be most
%  appropriate:

                JOHN BARLEYCORN 
                        -Traditional

        There were three men come out of the West 
        Their fortunes for to try,
        And these three men made a solemn vow:
        John Barleycorn should die!
        John Barleycorn should die!
                        (nb: 4th line of each verse is sung twice)

        They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,
        Threw clods upon his head,
        And these three men made a solemn vow:
        John Barleycorn was dead!

        CHORUS: Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
                Sing fa la la lay oh! 
                Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
                Sing fa la la lay oh!

        They let him lie for a very long time
        'Til the rain from Heaven did fall,
        Then Little Sir John sprung up his head,
        And so amazed them all!

        They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide,
        'Til he grew both pale and wan,
        Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard,
        And so became a man!

           BARD/GREEN MAN: If the coven has no Bard available,

                           HP, if needed.

         ------------------------------------------------

%  The place of ritual should be set up, away from the gathered 
%  participants. This is not something that people should miss,
%  so make sure that potty break is taken care of before the
%  circle is cast.

HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a

Re: Beginners unite.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi all!  I'm new to all this.  I have not been able to really 
contact any Wiccans or pagans, so I am reading books for now and 
trying to go by my intuition and what feels "right". So far, by 
letting the Power flow through me, and giving my intellectual side 
up, I have been able to do several interesting rituals. One I did 
yesterday was completely unplanned.  While I was packing a lunch to 
take out to my favorite tree, something told me to take a knife and 
jar of water with me.  On the way there, I stopped at a grocery 
store and picked up a melon.  When I got to the tree, I sat and ate 
my lunch.  Just before I started eating the melon, I got the idea 
that I should carve a pentagram on the side, and eat half of the 
melon.  The other half I should carve into pieces and leave at the 
base of the tree. I then "charged" the water, traced a pentagram on 
the tree (with some of the water), and poured part of it over the 
melon.  The rest I gave to a small tree near my lunch spot.  I knew 
it was a protection ritual; a strong one (I have been dealing with 
some very weird stuff lately!). Since then I have felt pretty safe. 
 I need to learn how to control my power, though; a while 
afterwards, I felt suddenly drained and very hungry.

Hm.. Perhaps it sounds a bit loony, but it sure seems to work for me.

@MSGID: 1:102/943.0 2a853542
Well.  There seems to be some problem with the OLR 
I'm using, or with the Mail Tagging routine on the 
Mysteria board, because I had to go in to the 
Book of Shadows message area and pack the 
messages from inside it.  

Until now, I'd just thought the board 
had been empty.

Now that I'm on the verge of achieving stable
communications with this board (and a couple others),
here is a document in three parts on the meanings of
the number thirteen.

I'm student teaching at a Wicca class, and the teacher
assigned that as a research project to one of the students.
She then told me I was the designated backup and official
resource, in the event that the student got stuck.

To be on the safe side, I sat down and wrote a paper
of my own.  The teacher liked it.  She had me present
it to the class.  The class, and the rest of the student
teachers, and the higher degree spectators all wanted
copies.

Also, I had put out a call for any ideas people had on
the meanings and significances of the number, and several
people wanted to see the final paper.

So I'll upload it here, too, starting next message....

                            Part 1/3

                           Karl Lembke

     How this document came to be:  When we were discussing the
Great Seal of the United States, and we were noting the number of
times the number 13 popped up.  When one of the students asked
what the significance of the number was, the teacher gave it to
that student as a research assignment.  I was designated the
official backup and resource, in case one was needed.  
     I wrote up my version of the report, just to have on hand at
need, and gave a copy to the teacher.  She liked it and told me
to prepare to give a presentation to the class in the near
future.  
     This was presented in class on August 6, 1992.  
     Fortunately, I had made copies, because as it turned out,
everyone wanted one.

     In class not too long ago, we were discussing the Great Seal
of the United States, and noting the repeated occurrence of
groups of thirteen.  This was cited as evidence that Wiccan ideas
had played a part in forming the country.  This may or may not be
the case, and the ideas may have come from Freemasonry rather
than Wicca, but there does seem to have been a fascination with
the number thirteen.

     Why is the number thirteen so sacred in Wicca?  The number
has quite a few correspondences and meanings.

     First, there are thirteen lunar months in a year, give or
take.  (A "year and a day" is thirteen canonical months of 28
days, and one day, which works out to 365 days.)

     Second, by Qabalistic gematria, thirteen is the numerical
value of the Hebrew words for love and unity.  Love is the force
which draws individuals together into one unified whole (e
pluribus unum).

     Third, the thirteenth path in Qabala, the path connecting
the spheres of Kether and Tiphareth, is represented by the Hebrew
letter gimel(1), meaning "camel".  The camel is an ugly and
ungainly beast, and people make fun of it.  (Camel:  A horse
built by a committee.) The beast is also ill-tempered, and spits.
     With incredible accuracy. 

     But the camel fulfills an essential function in the desert,
and quite literally is essential for life among the Bedouins and
other nomadic peoples of the desert.(2)
     Likewise, the United States is founded upon principles that
are often awkward and cumbersome.  People poke fun at various
applications of these principles.  ("I don't make up jokes, I
just watch the government and report the facts." X Will Rogers.) 
Other applications of these principles are reviled; people
complain about "loopholes" and "technicalities".
     Yet the same "technicalities" that force people to allow,
for instance, the American Nazi Party to hold a parade on
Israel's Independence Day, protect the right of a group of
Witches to worship in a public park.  The same "technicalities"
that accused criminals use to "get off" protect you and me from
the knock on the door at 3 A.M. on trumped up charges (or no
charges until and unless they find something in their search).
     You get the picture.  Funny looking, sometimes to the point
of ugliness; awkward and cumbersome; vitally essential.

     In Pythagorean analysis(3), one way of understanding the
meaning of prime numbers (thirteen is the seventh prime, though
mathematicians tend not to count one as a prime) is to regard
them as transcending by one the composite number immediately
preceding them.  Thus, thirteen is one greater than twelve, and
therefore transcends the concepts inherent in the number twelve.
     Twelve is often held to represent the completeness of the
world.  There are twelve signs of the zodiac, representing a
balanced structure of aspects.  There are twelve solar months in
the year, one for each sign.  Twelve is the product of four -
representing the establishment of a permanent structure, and
three - representing the synthesis new truth from two polar
opposites.  Thus, twelve, the establishment of a structure which
reconciles opposites, represents the worldX the realm which is
rich enough and large enough to encompass everything under the
sun, even if they are opposed to each other.  It also represents
the world as the realm where entities do not exist in pure
states, but must contend with and somehow adjust to the presence
of their opposites.
     Thirteen is the prime which transcends this concept.  It
contains the resonances of twelve within it, yet there is the
unit which remains above and outside the concept.

                               13
                             Part 2/3

                         by Karl Lembke

     Thirteen is the traditional complement of a coven.  This
worked out to six working couples and one leader.  The
leader-plus-twelve unit is a very old tradition.  We see it in
the story of Jesus and the Disciples, King Arthur and the Knights
of the Round Table, Robin Hood and his Merry Men, even Judge and
Jury in American and British law.
     So thirteen is the number of leadership in the world.  Yet,
it must be understood that this is not leadership by force. 
Thirteen is the concept of striking out in a new direction and
leading by example.
     In olden days, among Europeans, it was possible to count as
high as twelve without taking off one's shoes.  Ten fingers, two
feet.  Thirteen represented uncharted territory, that which was
outside the area made safe and secure.  This is one reason why
thirteen has been regarded with some trepidation.  It is a rare
individual who can not only strike out into this uncharted
territory, but inspire others to follow, thereby being "a light
unto the nations".
     (Among many "primitive" tribes, one was a leader not by
strength of arms, but because people chose to follow.  The reason
they chose to follow is that they had come, through experience,
to recognize the merit of the path their leader chose.  Any
leader who attempted to exert power for the sake of power was
liable to wake up one day to find that "his" tribe had declined
to follow him any more; in fact had taken a different path and
left him.  Sometimes, quite literally, voting with their feet.)

     Numbers can also be analyzed by reducing them in various
ways.
     The digits can be added, for example.  In the case of
thirteen, we get 1 + 3 = 4.
     As has been mentioned, four is a stabilizing number.  It
represents the addition of structure, the codification, of the
relationship which materialized in the number three.  Four is the
number of the elements and the directions.  

     Four is also the number of the sphere of Chesed in Qabala. 
Chesed, or Mercy, is the middle sphere on the pillar of force. 
It was formed from the energy overflowing from Binah, the sphere
of restriction, and it receives its energy most directly from
Chokmah, the sphere of pure force.  Chesed is where the
restrictions and forms inherited from Binah are animated and made
flexible by the controlled use of force.  This is where the
letter of the law is animated and ennobled by the spirit of the
law.  (In the now defunct USSR, and in many other places, the
letter of the law is a straight jacket.  It describes why one can
not do what one wants or needs to do.  U.S. law and custom has
generally tried to find ways to work inside the law to allow
personal freedom.  This is the Chesedic interpretation of law.)
     Chesed also represents what is known as "power with".  That
is, the sort of power that exists because it is shared.  The
magical image of Chesed, "a wise and kindly king", is followed
not because his followers feel they have to, but because they
want to.  Rather than "might makes right", Chesed rules by the
principles of "right makes might".

     The digits of a number can also be multiplied together.  
     One times three is three.  This is the number which
represents the synthesis of opposites to arrive at a new truth. 
When opposites are combined, they do not cancel out.  They react
in various ways, and in order to maintain each in the presence of
the other, it is necessary to discover the hidden truths held in
common by each.  This is the sphere whose magical weapon is the
cauldron of Cerridwen, from which live things emerge dead, and
dead things emerge alive.  The hidden unity of life and death is
a mystery, upon which meditation will bring riches.
     Three is also the number of the Goddess and the Christian
Trinity.  

     The Qabalistic sphere of Binah represents pure form.  It is
the kind of form we see in a crystal, where all the atoms are
arrayed in a strictly regular order.  Interestingly enough, there
are no perfect crystals in nature.  A perfect crystal would have
to be infinite in extent, since an edge would represent a break
in the crystal structure.  But it is the breaks (the edges and
facets) which give a crystal its fire.
     One of the conflicts which had to be resolved in forming the
United States was regarding the correct balance of restriction
and authority.  The Founding Fathers feared central authority,
and wished to take steps to ensure that despotic rule would never
take over this new land.  As a result, a structure was
established which fragmented power, in a controlled way.  All
power was not to reside with one entity, but to be balanced, as
evenly as possible, among all the different entities that
comprised government.

                            Part 3/3

                         by Karl Lembke

     Thirteen can also be regarded as the sum of various numbers.

In Wicca, the five fold salute is actually comprised of eight
kisses, since there are two feet, two knees, and two breasts.(5) 
Eight and five is thirteen.  Eight is also important in Wicca,
since there are eight paths to the center, eight festivals in the
Wheel of the Year, and eight ways of raising power in circle. 
There are five things one must have before one can practice the
magical Art.  These are: Intention, preparation, invocation,
consecration and purification.  There are five elements, each
given to one point of the pentagram.  Five also represents the
four elements plus spirit, or the four directions plus the Holy
Center.  

     Interestingly enough, we have derived the numbers 4 and 3
from 13.  The product of 4 and 3 is 12, which takes us back to
the number which 13 transcends.  The sum of 3 and 4 is seven, the
number which represents the union of pure spirit and matter. 
Seven is also a mystical number, since it also represents the
relationship and synthesis (3) of the laws of matter and energy
(4), and the universe (12 = 3 X 4).  13 is the seventh prime.

     This essay really only touches the surface of the possible
ways of analyzing the number 13.  There are many other areas to
explore in gematria, including examining the multiples of 13
(YHVH, in Hebrew numeration, works out to 26 = 2 X 13).
     Pythagorean analysis can be extended by examining all the
pairs of numbers which add up to 13.  We have examined two out of
the six here.

     Temura is a method in the Qabalah by which the letters in a
word or phrase are replaced with others according to specific
rules.  Obviously, changing the letters in a word will change the
numerical total of that word.  It can be interesting to examine
words which yield a value of 13 after temura.
     Other useful explorations in gematria include examining
pairs of words and phrases whose numerical values differ by 13. 
This is one area where the possibilities are, quite literally,
endless.
                           Blessed be!

Re: Book Of Shadows?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Caught your message of 27JUL92 which asked:

DA}Could anyone explain to me what a "Book of Shadows" is?  I would
  }guess at either a) The Satanic Bible or b) The Necromicon ... 
but I
  }am awaiting enlightenment.

I suppose that you have already been flooded with indignant replies 
for
this question but I shall endavor to answer your question.

First of all, both of your guesses are completely wrong. The Satanic
Bible is some hokey stuff put out by Anton LaVey (carnie huckster,
Satanic High Priest and all around creep) that justifies his strong 
arm
approach to life. It seems to be written to be both obscurely 
historical
and offensive to most Christians and Pagans.

The Necromonicon is one of two things: a fictional book that is a 
source
for the `Cthulhu Mythos' which the horror fiction world perpetuated 
by
H.P. Lovecraft, August Derleth & other. The other Necronomicon was
writtten in the 70's by a group of folks who claimed to be reaching 
the
ancient Sumerian gods. Their scholarship is suspect, to say the 
least,
and they admitted that whatever it was that they called up, they 
had a
hard time getting rid of it! If you like having the spiritual 
equivalent
of bengal tigers wandering around your magical space, use this book.

Book of Shadows is the melodramatic term for the history and 
rituals of
a particular bunch of Craft workers. Since it deals with things 
that are
best seen in the light of the Moon or by candles, shadows are big 
part
of the experience. I've seen nicely bound and calligraphed books,
computer printouts, mimeographs, etc. called a Book of Shadows. 
There is
also a contingent of modern pagans who have Discs of Shadows!

Any further questions, seeker?

                           Karl Lembke

     How this document came to be:  When we were discussing the
Great Seal of the United States, and we were noting the number of
times the number 13 popped up.  When one of the students asked
what the significance of the number was, the teacher gave it to
that student as a research assignment.  I was designated the
official backup and resource, in case one was needed.  
     I wrote up my version of the report, just to have on hand at
need, and gave a copy to the teacher.  She liked it and told me
to prepare to give a presentation to the class in the near
future.  
     This was presented in class on August 6, 1992.  
     Fortunately, I had made copies, because as it turned out,
everyone wanted one.

     In class not too long ago, we were discussing the Great Seal
of the United States, and noting the repeated occurrence of
groups of thirteen.  This was cited as evidence that Wiccan ideas
had played a part in forming the country.  This may or may not be
the case, and the ideas may have come from Freemasonry rather
than Wicca, but there does seem to have been a fascination with
the number thirteen.

     Why is the number thirteen so sacred in Wicca?  The number
has quite a few correspondences and meanings.

     First, there are thirteen lunar months in a year, give or
take.  (A "year and a day" is thirteen canonical months of 28
days, and one day, which works out to 365 days.)

     Second, by Qabalistic gematria, thirteen is the numerical
value of the Hebrew words for love and unity.  Love is the force
which draws individuals together into one unified whole (e
pluribus unum).

     Third, the thirteenth path in Qabala, the path connecting
the spheres of Kether and Tiphareth, is represented by the Hebrew
letter gimel(1), meaning "camel".  The camel is an ugly and
ungainly beast, and people make fun of it.  (Camel:  A horse
built by a committee.) The beast is also ill-tempered, and spits.
     With incredible accuracy. 

     But the camel fulfills an essential function in the desert,
and quite literally is essential for life among the Bedouins and
other nomadic peoples of the desert.(2)
     Likewise, the United States is founded upon principles that
are often awkward and cumbersome.  People poke fun at various
applications of these principles.  ("I don't make up jokes, I
just watch the government and report the facts." X Will Rogers.) 
Other applications of these principles are reviled; people
complain about "loopholes" and "technicalities".
     Yet the same "technicalities" that force people to allow,
for instance, the American Nazi Party to hold a parade on
Israel's Independence Day, protect the right of a group of
Witches to worship in a public park.  The same "technicalities"
that accused criminals use to "get off" protect you and me from
the knock on the door at 3 A.M. on trumped up charges (or no
charges until and unless they find something in their search).
     You get the picture.  Funny looking, sometimes to the point
of ugliness; awkward and cumbersome; vitally essential.

     In Pythagorean analysis(3), one way of understanding the
meaning of prime numbers (thirteen is the seventh prime, though
mathematicians tend not to count one as a prime) is to regard
them as transcending by one the composite number immediately
preceding them.  Thus, thirteen is one greater than twelve, and
therefore transcends the concepts inherent in the number twelve.
     Twelve is often held to represent the completeness of the
world.  There are twelve signs of the zodiac, representing a
balanced structure of aspects.  There are twelve solar months in
the year, one for each sign.  Twelve is the product of four -
representing the establishment of a permanent structure, and
three - representing the synthesis new truth from two polar
opposites.  Thus, twelve, the establishment of a structure which
reconciles opposites, represents the worldX the realm which is
rich enough and large enough to encompass everything under the
sun, even if they are opposed to each other.  It also represents
the world as the realm where entities do not exist in pure
states, but must contend with and somehow adjust to the presence
of their opposites.
     Thirteen is the prime which transcends this concept.  It
contains the resonances of twelve within it, yet there is the
unit which remains above and outside the concept.

                             Part 2/3

                         by Karl Lembke

     Thirteen is the traditional complement of a coven.  This
worked out to six working couples and one leader.  The
leader-plus-twelve unit is a very old tradition.  We see it in
the story of Jesus and the Disciples, King Arthur and the Knights
of the Round Table, Robin Hood and his Merry Men, even Judge and
Jury in American and British law.
     So thirteen is the number of leadership in the world.  Yet,
it must be understood that this is not leadership by force. 
Thirteen is the concept of striking out in a new direction and
leading by example.
     In olden days, among Europeans, it was possible to count as
high as twelve without taking off one's shoes.  Ten fingers, two
feet.  Thirteen represented uncharted territory, that which was
outside the area made safe and secure.  This is one reason why
thirteen has been regarded with some trepidation.  It is a rare
individual who can not only strike out into this uncharted
territory, but inspire others to follow, thereby being "a light
unto the nations".
     (Among many "primitive" tribes, one was a leader not by
strength of arms, but because people chose to follow.  The reason
they chose to follow is that they had come, through experience,
to recognize the merit of the path their leader chose.  Any
leader who attempted to exert power for the sake of power was
liable to wake up one day to find that "his" tribe had declined
to follow him any more; in fact had taken a different path and
left him.  Sometimes, quite literally, voting with their feet.)

     Numbers can also be analyzed by reducing them in various
ways.
     The digits can be added, for example.  In the case of
thirteen, we get 1 + 3 = 4.
     As has been mentioned, four is a stabilizing number.  It
represents the addition of structure, the codification, of the
relationship which materialized in the number three.  Four is the
number of the elements and the directions.  

     Four is also the number of the sphere of Chesed in Qabala. 
Chesed, or Mercy, is the middle sphere on the pillar of force. 
It was formed from the energy overflowing from Binah, the sphere
of restriction, and it receives its energy most directly from
Chokmah, the sphere of pure force.  Chesed is where the
restrictions and forms inherited from Binah are animated and made
flexible by the controlled use of force.  This is where the
letter of the law is animated and ennobled by the spirit of the
law.  (In the now defunct USSR, and in many other places, the
letter of the law is a straight jacket.  It describes why one can
not do what one wants or needs to do.  U.S. law and custom has
generally tried to find ways to work inside the law to allow
personal freedom.  This is the Chesedic interpretation of law.)
     Chesed also represents what is known as "power with".  That
is, the sort of power that exists because it is shared.  The
magical image of Chesed, "a wise and kindly king", is followed
not because his followers feel they have to, but because they
want to.  Rather than "might makes right", Chesed rules by the
principles of "right makes might".

     The digits of a number can also be multiplied together.  
     One times three is three.  This is the number which
represents the synthesis of opposites to arrive at a new truth. 
When opposites are combined, they do not cancel out.  They react
in various ways, and in order to maintain each in the presence of
the other, it is necessary to discover the hidden truths held in
common by each.  This is the sphere whose magical weapon is the
cauldron of Cerridwen, from which live things emerge dead, and
dead things emerge alive.  The hidden unity of life and death is
a mystery, upon which meditation will bring riches.
     Three is also the number of the Goddess and the Christian
Trinity.  

     The Qabalistic sphere of Binah represents pure form.  It is
the kind of form we see in a crystal, where all the atoms are
arrayed in a strictly regular order.  Interestingly enough, there
are no perfect crystals in nature.  A perfect crystal would have
to be infinite in extent, since an edge would represent a break
in the crystal structure.  But it is the breaks (the edges and
facets) which give a crystal its fire.
     One of the conflicts which had to be resolved in forming the
United States was regarding the correct balance of restriction
and authority.  The Founding Fathers feared central authority,
and wished to take steps to ensure that despotic rule would never
take over this new land.  As a result, a structure was
established which fragmented power, in a controlled way.  All
power was not to reside with one entity, but to be balanced, as
evenly as possible, among all the different entities that
comprised government.

     Thirteen can also be regarded as the sum of various numbers.

In Wicca, the five fold salute is actually comprised of eight
kisses, since there are two feet, two knees, and two breasts.(5) 
Eight and five is thirteen.  Eight is also important in Wicca,
since there are eight paths to the center, eight festivals in the
Wheel of the Year, and eight ways of raising power in circle. 
There are five things one must have before one can practice the
magical Art.  These are: Intention, preparation, invocation,
consecration and purification.  There are five elements, each
given to one point of the pentagram.  Five also represents the
four elements plus spirit, or the four directions plus the Holy
Center.  

     Interestingly enough, we have derived the numbers 4 and 3
from 13.  The product of 4 and 3 is 12, which takes us back to
the number which 13 transcends.  The sum of 3 and 4 is seven, the
number which represents the union of pure spirit and matter. 
Seven is also a mystical number, since it also represents the
relationship and synthesis (3) of the laws of matter and energy
(4), and the universe (12 = 3 X 4).  13 is the seventh prime.

     This essay really only touches the surface of the possible
ways of analyzing the number 13.  There are many other areas to
explore in gematria, including examining the multiples of 13
(YHVH, in Hebrew numeration, works out to 26 = 2 X 13).
     Pythagorean analysis can be extended by examining all the
pairs of numbers which add up to 13.  We have examined two out of
the six here.

     Temura is a method in the Qabalah by which the letters in a
word or phrase are replaced with others according to specific
rules.  Obviously, changing the letters in a word will change the
numerical total of that word.  It can be interesting to examine
words which yield a value of 13 after temura.
     Other useful explorations in gematria include examining
pairs of words and phrases whose numerical values differ by 13. 
This is one area where the possibilities are, quite literally,
endless.
                           Blessed be!

        Very simple, really.  If the Ritual in question: 1) honors 
neither Lord nor Lady, 2) is not in celebration of one of the five 
core Mysteries, OR 3) is in violation of the Rede; IT IS NOT WICCAN.

JP}>heard of anyone else using it)

              the concept is used by numerous groups ---
    both pagan & non-pagan.  however, of pagan types,
    wiccans are the most likely to refer to something as
    their book of shadows, whilst ceremonial magiicians
    refer to their grimoire.  but both terms have been used
    interchangably, especially amongs neo-pagan groups.

    the question more properly is, can both wiccan & non-
    wiccan individuals benefit from sharing their rites &
    rituals in a platform such as this?
    << note:  i did not state discuss their rites, but
    sharing them --- there is a difference >>
