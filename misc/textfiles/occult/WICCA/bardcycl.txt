THE BARDIC YEAR
              Ritual for Wiccan groups
        - by the White Bard 1991-92 CE
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
The following are suggested rituals within the four major calendar 
celebrations. They are written from a Wiccan standpoint, using 
Celtic traditions, and take the form of Mystery Plays that 
(sometimes) are -not- fully explained (!). Try not to explain them 
to the participants, but rather allow them to act upon the
participants in a subliminal, emotional fashion. That is, after
all, what they are designed to do.

Note: "%" marks "stage directions"
  
                        N:earth      
            W:water                    E:air
                        S:fire

The BARD should stand to the WEST, unless otherwise specified in
the ritual.

            YULE RITUAL: 21 December
                  -by the White Bard

Materials:  a very small, just sprouted potted plant.
            a candle for each covener present.
            a MOTHER. She should wear a blue garment, if possible.
            a MAIDEN, dressed in white.
            a Crown of Light, made from three, six, or nine
                candles.
            a BARD/GREEN MAN.

%  The ceremony for the Lesser Sabbats should be written by newer
%  members of the coven, as part of their learning. At an appropriate
%  place in the ceremony, the following should be inserted:

%  Here begins the Yule Mystery. ALL light shall be        
%  extinguished, all fires put out, save that in the South. 
%  The Bard/Green Man shall lie on his back in the East, as 
%  if dead.

%  The HPS shall say:

HPS: Darkness covers all. The Old King is dead, and there is no
     warmth for the Mother. The days are short, and the nights
     are long.

COVEN: Give us Light!

HPS: The Maiden wanders the Earth, Maiden no more, but soon to be
     Mother. The Earth is cold, and there is no place for her to
     give birth.

COVEN: Give us Light!

HP: Mother, give us the Child of Promise! The Lord Of Life strains
    to be born!

COVEN: Give us Light!

MOTHER: I seek a place to rest, and give birth.

%   The Mother should wander about the inside of the circle, as if
%   looking for something, and not finding it. She should act very
%   tired, and project a sense of urgency.
%   She then goes to the East, and assumes the Goddess pose, standing,
%   arms and legs spread in the form of a five-pointed star.
%   There shall be a pause, and the Bard/Green Man shall then quietly
%   rise up, and stand behind the Mother. If it seems appropriate, the
%   more primitive symbolism of him crawling out from between the legs
%   of the Mother may be used. He should be carrying a lit candle, or
%   some other source of light.

BARD/GREEN MAN: Cunning and art I do not lack,
                But -always- Her Cauldron brings me back!

%   The Bard/Green Man shall take his lit candle, and proceed to re-light
%   the corner candles, moving deasil, and any other fires within the circle.
%   The just-sprouted potted plant is picked up by the Mother and held in
%   front of her during this candle-lighting.
%   The Bard/Green Man shall then take the plant from the hands of the Mother,
%   bring it to the center of the circle, and raise it above his head, saying:

BARD/GREEN MAN: Here is the Promise, that is always fulfilled.

%   The plant is then passed around the circle, and given to the Mother, who
%   should take it home and water and nurture it thru the year, if possible.
%   The Maiden shall then take the place of the Mother, and the Mother shall
%   return to her place within the circle.
%   Here ends the Yule Mystery.

        CANDLEMAS (IMBOLC) RITUAL: 2 February
                           -by the White Bard

Materials:  a candle for each covener present.
            a MAIDEN, dressed in white.
            a Crown of Light, made from three, six, or nine
                candles.
            a BARD/GREEN MAN.
            a DARK LORD, dressed in dark clothing, and holding a
              dark cloak.

%  The place of ritual should be set up, away from the
%  gathered participants.
%  It is more than a good idea to manage bathrooms and such like
%  before the circle is closed. This Mystery is not something any 
%  of the participants should miss out on!
  
HPS: Go we now to the sacred place
     And stand within the sacred space
     Turn your minds to sacred things
     And dance with me unto the ring!

%  HP and HPS lead the coven to the place of ritual by a
%  spiral dance, ending in a circle around the altar. The
%  cauldron should be at the south. The Bard/Green Man
%  dances at the end of the line. A good song to sing here
%  is "Lord Of The Dance."

HPS: Come we forth, with the Spiral Dance
     Within the Lady's radiance
     To celebrate the Sun's rebirth
     To renew life, to warm the Earth

     Earth and Water, Fire and Air
     I invoke the Goddess there!
     This night we are Between the Worlds
     To celebrate the year unfurled!

HP: Earth and Water, Fire and Sky
    I invoke the God on high
    This night we are Between the Worlds
    To celebrate the year unfurled!

%   The corners shall be called thusly, that all may hear, but 
%   shall not be called until the HPS reaches that corner on her
%   circumnabulation.

EAST:   O Guardians of the Eastern Tower,
        Airy ones of healing power
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!
        By the Power that made us all;
        By the Power that blesses Thee:
        Come to us; and Blessed Be!

SOUTH:  Oh fiery ones of Southern Power
        Thus I invite you to this tower
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!
        By the Power that made us all;
        By the Power that blesses Thee:
        Come to us; and Blessed Be!

WEST:   Western ones of water's flow
        Help to guard us here below
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!
        By the Power that made us all;
        By the Power that blesses Thee:
        Come to us; and Blessed Be!

NORTH:  Earthen ones of Northern fame
        Bless and guard our Power's fane
        I do summon, stir and call you 
        See these rites and guard this circle!

        Come to us and heed our call!
        By the Power that made us all;
        By the Power that blesses Thee:
        Come to us; and Blessed Be!

%  The HPS shall move to each corner, and say, following each
%  corner's crying as she moves to the next:

HPS: So I cast and consecrate 
     This Circle of the small and great:
     By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
     By Rock and Earth, by Land and Sea,
     By Fire and Water, Earth and Air,
     By the Lord, and Lady Fair!
     By Love and Joy and Work and Play,
     All things harmful cast away!
     By lightening's flash, and rain's soft fall,
     By the Power that made us all;
     By the Power that blesses Thee:
     (Cast the Circle: Blessed be!)

%  On her return to the first corner she shall change the last
%  line above, and say:  

     The Circle's cast; and Blessed Be!

%  The callers of the corners shall return their tools to the
%  altar, and then shall join the circle at their corners.

        --------------------------------------------------

%   Here begins the Candlemas (Imbolc) Mystery: 
%   The Maiden shall step forth, and say:

MAIDEN: This is the time of Brigid, the Patron of Poets and Fire,
        and of Healing.

HPS: This is the time of new beginnings, when the Mother has become
     Maiden.

HP: The days have turned, and grow longer, and the Sun-child is
    growing to His strength.

BARD/GREEN MAN: I have been a wave upon the sea,
                And a spark in the firelight.

                I have been a fish in the ocean.
                I have been a Thought within a Word,
                And a Word within a Deed.
                I was cast away, and found again.

                I have been made of flowers
                And of cold steel and brass.
                Fire and ice are alike unto me.

                I have been the narrow blade of a sword
                That kills without cutting.
                And the Void is my homeland.

                I have been in Caer Sidi
                In the Spiral Castle of Glass.
                And the letters on the Standing Stones 
                Are no secret from me.

                I have been in Annwyn
                And Tir na n'Og,
                I have danced the Spiral Dance,
                And drunk from the Hierlas at daybreak.

                I have ridden beneath two ravens
                And served in the kitchen,
                And all places are alike unto me.

                I have been a child
                And now I come into my strength!

                I invoke the Land, the dear Land,
                the Earth our Mother!

MAIDEN: The cycles of the Moon have taken their course, and I am
        in my Maidenhood. The stars are kindled, and I dance in
        their light.

DARK LORD: Thy home is with me thru the long months of Winter, and
           the Earth shall lie fallow and bare.
                                                   
%   The HPS shall then light the candles of the Crown of Light,
%   and shall approach the Maiden, who is now standing in the East, and
%   place it upon her head.
%   She shall now, in company with the Bard/Green Man, circumnabulate the
%   circle, and the coveners shall light their candles from her crown.
%   The Bard/Green Man shall return to his normal place within the circle
%   and the Maiden shall place the Crown of Light on the altar.
%   The Maiden shall then approach the Dark Lord, and kneel before him,
%   and he shall say:

DARK LORD: As it always is, always was, and always shall be. Come
           to my Kingdom.

%   Here he shall place the dark cloak around her, and they shall retire
%   to the West.  
%   Here ends the Candlemas Mystery.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

%   A normal cone-of-power may be raised, for growth and healing:

HPS: In a ring we all shall stand
     Pass the Power, hand to hand.

HP: As the Sun is given birth
    Build the Power; root to Earth

HPS: Pass the Power, hand to hand
     Bless the Lady, bless the Land

HP: Bless the Lord, and bless the Skies
    Bless the Power that never dies!

%   The above four verses should be repeated three times, (or
%   as many times as needed) and then the HPS should say:

HPS: By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree:
     Let the Power flow out and free!
     
%   All should release, at this point.

        ------------------------------------------------------

%   Such coven business as must be transacted may be done here.
%   This is a good time to bless candles for use during the coming year.
%   This is also a good time for initiations.

        ------------------------------------------------------

%   The Circle is opened.  

HPS: Thus I release the East and West
     Thanks to them from Host to Guest
     Thus I release the South and North
     With "Blessed Be' I send them forth!
     The Circle's open, dance we so
     Out and homeward we shall go.
     Earth and Water, Air and Fire
     Celebrated our desire.
     The Sun's returned to banish dark
     The Earth awakes to sunlight's spark.
     By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
     Our circle's done; and Blessed Be!

COVEN: Blessed Be!

%   All spiral dance out from the Circle.

Materials:  a MAIDEN, who shall be dressed in white, covered by a
            black (or other dark material) cloak, preferably with

%  Bard and Maiden shall stand together in the North, with the HP
%  between them.

MAIDEN:  I have been in the Kingdom of the Dark Lord,
         Where no Sun shines.

         And all things shall rejoice with me.

   (c) copyright 1990 W. J. Bethancourt III
   (Tune: "Dublin City")

BARD:    As I walked out one quiet evening
         At the hour of twelve at night
         Who should I meet but a fair young maiden
         Combin' her hair by candle light;
         Lassie, I have come a-courtin'
         Your kind favours for to win
         And if you'd heed my petition
         I would be your Paladin...

(CHORUS) Gather roses in the Springtime
         Gather roses while ye may,
         Time is passing; roses wither;
         Winter comes; we're here -today-.

%  Bard moves to the South, Maiden moves to the East. 

BARD:    Have you seen the dew a-formin'
         On the grass at early morn?
         Have you seen the forest quiet,
         Or a stag that's barely born?
         Have you seen the dawn a-breakin'
         O'er the Western Ocean's tide?
         Have you felt my heart a-beatin'
         When it's held close to your side?

(CHORUS) Gather roses in the Springtime
         Gather roses while ye may,
         Time is passing; roses wither;
         Winter comes; we're here -today-.

%  Bard moves to the West, Maiden moves to the South.

BARD:    I can give no gold or silver,
         I can give no fields of land,
         I can give no servants brisk
         To wait on you both foot and hand;
         I can give you wide roads callin'
         Wind and Rain, and Moon and Sun,
         Songs to sing, and love and laughter,
         Dresses made of plain home-spun.

(CHORUS) Gather roses in the Springtime
         Gather roses while ye may,
         Time is passing; roses wither;
         Winter comes; we're here -today-.

%  Bard moves to the North, Maiden moves to the West.

BARD:    Come dance with me upon the greensward
         In the moonlight, in the Spring.
         Dance with me within the forest
         Dance with me within the ring!
         Earth below us, stars above us,
         Fire and water by our side,
         Dance with me within the moonlight,

%  The HP shall try to hold her back, by holding her dark cloak,
%  but she shall unclasp it, and move to the center, leaving the
%  HP holding the cloak, revealing herself dressed in white, and 
%  shall stand beside the Bard.

MAIDEN:  I have been in the Kingdom of the Dark Lord,
         Where no Sun shines.
         But now I return to the green of Earth,
         And all things shall rejoice with me.

%  The HPS shall crown the Maiden with a wreath of flowers.
%  Here ends the Eostar Mystery.

              THE DAY OF THE FOOL: April 1
                        -by the White Bard

%  This day is not in the traditional cycle, but should not be
%  omitted by those of the Bardic Path. There is no "set" ritual,
%  but this is the time for satire and general foolery by all.
%  A good thing to do here is to have a simple gathering, perhaps
%  a pot-luck, choose a King and/or Queen of Fools, and have a
%  good party. See the German Fasching or Mardi Gras for hints.

           the Maiden should wear white, if possible

           a fire, as close to the ground as possible
           A BARD/GREEN MAN (note: if you have no Bard, then a
                male to act as Green Man should be chosen either
                by lottery, or by the Maiden. The Maiden is, of
                course, free to request a specific person to
                act as Green Man even if there is a Bard available

        ------------------------------------------------

%   If there is a May Pole, it should be erected by the men -only- at
%   this point, and all dance around it, alternating male and female
%   to raise the cone of power as outlined below.  
%   A normal cone-of-power may be raised, for growth and healing:

HPS: In a ring we all shall stand
     Pass the Power, hand to hand.

HP: As the year is given birth
    Build the Power; root to Earth

HPS: Pass the Power, hand to hand
     Bless the Lady, bless the Land

HP: Bless the Lord, and bless the Skies
    Bless the Power that never dies!

%   The above four verses should be repeated three times, (or
%   as many as needed to fully wrap the pole) and then the HPS
%   should say:

HPS: By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree:
     Let the Power flow out and free!
     
%   All should release, at this point.

        ------------------------------------------------------

%   Such coven business as must be transacted may be done here.

     With "Blessed Be' I send them forth!
     The Circle's open, dance we so
     Out and homeward we shall go.
     Earth and Water, Air and Fire
     Celebrated our desire.
     Winter's cold is gone away
     Now it is the Day of May.
     By Fin and Feather, Leaf and Tree,
     Our circle's done; and Blessed Be!

COVEN: Blessed Be!

%   All spiral dance out from the Circle, jumping the fire as 
%   they go. HP and HPS lead, with Bard/Green Man and Maiden
%   taking care of bringing the Bel Fire into camp. Allow the Bel
%   fire to burn out on its own, if possible, otherwise put it
%   out with the water from the Caldron. Disposal of the water
%   otherwise should be to pour it at the roots of a tree.
%   All participants may take fire from the Bel Fire to take home
%   with them, cook over, or whatever, before it is extinguished.

           MIDSUMMER RITUAL: (Summer Solstice)
                            -by the White Bard

Materials: a GREEN MAN, dressed in green, bearing a leafy branch.
           Small cakes, and a drink of some sort, preferably apple
           based. For covens that use alcohol, mead would be ok, too.

%  The ceremony for the Lesser Sabbats should be written by newer
%  members of the coven, as part of their learning. At an appropriate
%  place in the ceremony, the following should be inserted:

HPS: This is the time of the Green Man; the Jack-of-the-Green; the
     Spirit of the Wood. Call him what you will, Robin Hood, Herne,
     or even Pan, this is His time! Rejoice in Summer!

%  The Green Man should rush into the circle, laughing and leaping.
%  It would be appropriate for him to carry a leafy branch, with
%  which to strike (lightly) the young women of the coven.
%  He shall then approach the cakes and drink, and pick one of each
%  up, hold them up to the coven, and say:

GREEN MAN: Behold the fruits of the Mother!

HP/HPS: Blessed be the food that nourishes us!

%  All should sit, and eat, and have a nice, quiet party of some sort!

     I show you a Mystery!

%  A small meal of bread and some form of beverage should be

%  shall approach the circle, and say:

LUGH: Merry meet to all! May I enter the circle?

HPS: And what talent do you have, that we do not?

LUGH: I am a Smith, to make tools and weapons.

HPS: We have Govannon, to make our tools and weapons. Go away.

LUGH: I am a Shaman, to offer the Sight Within.

HPS: Any of us can do that. Go away.

LUGH: I am a Farmer, to grow your food.

HPS: We have the Young God and the Maiden, to set our food to
     grow. We have no need of you. Go away.

LUGH: I am a Warrior, to defend you.

HPS: We have those of the Warrior Path, and their valor is

LUGH: But do you have one who is ALL of these? For I am Lugh,
      the Ruler, the Singer, the Long-Sighted, the Craftsman,
      and all Talents are as ONE with me.

HPS: This we do not have, indeed, and you are Lugh Samildanach. 
     Enter and be welcome!

%  The HPS shall open the circle and Lugh shall enter and be seated
%  with the company. Lugh shall -limp- when he walks, and shall
%  walk, and sit, in obvious pain.
%  He should look around him, as if expecting something.
%  If none within the circle asks why he is limping, or otherwise
%  expresses concern, the Maiden shall say:

MAIDEN: Sir, why do you limp? Are you injured?

LUGH: You have asked The Question, and I thank you. Seek you the
      Cauldron of Healing, the Cauldron of Cerridwen, for my time

                    RITUAL: (Fall Equinox)
                        -by the White Bard

Materials: An OLD KING
           
%  The ceremony for the Lesser Sabbats should be written by newer
%  members of the coven, as part of their learning. At an appropriate
%  place in the ceremony, the following should be inserted:

%  The Old King shall move in a feeble manner to the West, and say:

OLD KING: I am aged, and I approach my Time. Help me, lest I die!

CRONE: There is no help for you, for all must travel that road.

%  The Old King shall then turn to the assembled coven, and say: 

OLD KING: Seek ye the Cauldron! Seek ye the Grail! It shall heal me
          And bring me forth again. 

%  Here a song  may be sung, and "John Barleycorn" would be most
%  appropriate:

                JOHN BARLEYCORN 
                        -Traditional

        There were three men come out of the West 
        Their fortunes for to try,
        And these three men made a solemn vow:
        John Barleycorn should die!
        John Barleycorn should die!
                        (nb: 4th line of each verse is sung twice)

        They plowed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,
        Threw clods upon his head,
        And these three men made a solemn vow:
        John Barleycorn was dead!

        CHORUS: Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
                Sing fa la la lay oh! 
                Fa la la la, it's a lovely day!
                Sing fa la la lay oh!

        They let him lie for a very long time
        'Til the rain from Heaven did fall,
        Then Little Sir John sprung up his head,
        And so amazed them all! 
 
        They let him stand 'til Midsummer tide, 
        'Til he grew both pale and wan, 
        Then Little Sir John he grew a long beard, 
        And so became a man! 
 
        They hired men with the sythes so sharp
        To cut him off at the knee 
        They rolled him and tied him about the waist, 
        And used him barbarously! 
 
        They hired men with the sharp pitchforks 
        To pierce him to the heart, 
        And the loader he served him worse than that, 
        For he tied him in a cart! 
 
        They wheeled him around and around the field, 
        'Til they came to a barn, 
        And there they made a solemn mow 
        Of poor John Barleycorn, 
 
        They hired men with the crab-tree sticks 
        To strip him skin from bone 
        And the Miller he served him worse than that:

        For he ground him between two stones! 
 
        They have wheeled him here and wheeled him there 
        And wheeled him to a barn, 
        And they have served him worse than that 
        They have bunged him in a vat! 
 
        They have worked their will on John Barleycorn 
        But he lived to tell the tale; 
        For they pour him out of an old brown jug, 
        And they call him home-brewed ale! 
 
        Here's Little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl, 
        And brandy in a glass! 
        And Little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl 
        Proved the stronger man at last! 
 
        For the huntsman he can't hunt the fox 
        Nor loudly blow his horn, 
        And the tinker can't mend kettles nor pots 
        Without John Barleycorn!

           BARD/GREEN MAN: If the coven has no Bard available,
