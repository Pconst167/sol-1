                       OCTOBER 11, 1985

Greetings and Blessed be:

     As promised, an update on the happenings in Atlanta. Ah, me, keep 
thinking back to all the times when we could write and say, "Things are 
quiet here..." Certainly can't say that these days!

     Seems there is a new development every day.  Lady Galadriel as 
been scheduled for a number of media appearance: A TV noon news live 
interview whch, though short (five minutes) was very positive; a 
newspaper article promised (on the religion page--waiting to see if 
this promise is kept) (Ed. note--it was), several radio appearances 
scheduled, including "Southwind" (aired natio nally - no date set); an 
interview on a local talk show - Monday, Oct 7 -- again, very positive.  
"Sound-off" talk show now scheduled for October 30, 9 p.m., WSB Radio, 
750 on your dial, from Atlanta. (A 75,000 watt station, many of you far 
away should be able to pick it up). At least we will get a chance to be 
heard--the small voice in the Wilderness.....

     Now to some of the heavier things: On Sunday, Sept. 29, we ent to 
the property to close down the Temple and unwind the circle.  We were 
promised police protection and even changed our chosen time to fit 
their choice of time.  The police were not there when we arrived, but, 
as there were so many of us, and believing the police would be along at 
any moment, we proceeded to the site and began setting things to 
rights.  Which was quite a job--the site had been completely 
demolished--it was heartbreaking. What we had seen on television was 
minor compared to what we found--the place was in complete shambles--
seems they decided that once they had begun the destruction they would 
finish it up completely--and they did.

     We had just begun cleaning up when several smart-aleck rednecks 
appeared and began hassling u.  We got rid of them and went back to 
work. Another one appeared--we eventually got talked him on down the 
road. We realized later that these were "scouts sent out by the enemy 
troops."  We had just begun our simpl rite to close the circle when we 
heard gunshots and trucks approaching and knew it was time to act!  As 
the site is on private land and the dirt road to it is a private road, 
we blocked the road with a few dead trees after the first men showed 
up.    Thankfully.  Up rumble 7 or 8 pickups/jeeps/four-wheelers, all 
loaded with dyed-in-the-wool rednecks--most of them completely 
intoxicated.  Thank goodness for the barricade--they did stop--for a 
while.  A confrontation followed--you can probably imagine--or can you?  
We never could have--before. We've heard a lot of language in our 
lives, but never so much filth at one time out of human (and we use the 
term loosely) mouths.  Several of them came over the barricade, on 
foot, to challenge us in their attempts to provoke us into a fight.  
There were 5 males and 3 females in our group at the roadway, 18 to 20 
men in theirs. That's the kind of odds they like.  (What they didn't 
know was that we had left 7 of our females at the circle site about 100 
yards away) to send us energy, and 4 oher males stationed as watchers 
in the woods between the roadway and the circle site.) It was funny, in 
a way, that when they were counting odds, they stated "There's only 5 
ofthem ," discounting the females they were aware of.  That could have 
been a fatal mistake! Severl of them came over the log barricade in 
their trucks and within inches of running over several of us.  Ever 
have a big pickup with monster wheels coming at you annd stop just 
inches away from your nose? Several of us did--and believe me, it is 
not a pleasant feeling.  They threw beer cans at us, but mostly it was 
sewer verbage and threats. The confrontation lasted about 20 minutes, 
luckily, no one was hurt, no damage done (except to our nerves).  Not 
one blow was thrown, although they did everything they could to push us 
into it.  Everyone stood there, calm, cool, and collected (on the 
outside--but our astral knees were knocking).  That was the saving 
factor, for the rednecks couldn't deal with our apparent lack of fear.  
Probably one of the few, if not the only times that someone faced them 
down and they turned and left.  It will take them a long time to get 
over that.

     SO proud of our folks!  Through it all not one word was said by 
our side that couldn't have been said in the First Baptist Church on 
Sunday morning.  In fact, the preacher probably said worse, for not 
even one "hell" or "damn" was spoken from our side of the line, while 
pure filth poured from the other side.

     To back up a bit, after the first men came by, two of our group 
went to call the police, to find out why they hadn't shown up and let 
them know they were needed right away.  It was almost an hour after 
they left before a policeman arrived -- one man, one car. By the time 
he arrived the rednecks had just left, we had finished closing the 
circle, and were getting in our cars to leave.

     Tuesday, October 1, a group of us went to file charges against 
these people for trespassing and simple assault.  Th detective was 
saying there wasn't anything they could do--we kept saying there had to 
be.  Our attorney, who was with us, also kept saying something could be 
done.  Eventually, the detective became a bit more cooperative.  We had 
the license plate numbers of 5 of the trucks, the name of one man, 
photos of some of them, and a tape recording of the entire incident. 
Yes--we were well-armed in one respect.  Just happened to have cameras 
and tape recorders with us and the presence of mind to use them.  The 
tape came out loud and clear, so there is no question of who said what.  
The detective finally called us back after identifying several of the 
people through their license plate numbers and photos, and our attorney 
advised us that our best course of legal action would be to file 
criminal trespass warrents against the persons involved, leaving the 
assault charges to the discretion of the judge who hears the trespass 
case(es). 

     Many of you have asked what you could do to help. Your support 
means so much to us for there is much to be done and so few of us to do 
it.  We certainly appreciate the positive energy which has come our 
way--we have been very aware f it and know it has helped sustain us 
through some harrowing times.  What can you do to help?  Energy 
directed to help us through the harassment and legal battles; to 
helping us find another site for our temple (with 30 to 40 people at 
each sabbat and New Moon, living rooms get crowded); to helping us find 
the finances for the legal fees (our attorney has spent, and will spend 
many hours working on our behalf without charge, but he can't afford to 
pay filing fees, deposition fees, etc., for s.  And the USPS gets 
richer while we get poorer. Even SASE's would help.)--all these are 
very much needed.  Information on how others have handled similar 
situations would be helpful, also.

     We have been asked, on several occasions, why we are standing to 
fight instead of quietly folding our altar cloths and stealing back 
into the shadows, as some have suggested we do.  We are certainly not 
doing it just for ourselves, as witnessed by the fact that at least two 
people have lost their jobs and the rest of us realize we could be 
next.  It is costing us dearly--in money, time, energy, and wear and 
tear on our nerves.  One person walked out of work to find "witch" 
scrawled across the windshield of her car--what will the next act be?  
We believe if we allow this to happen without protest, then every other 
group in our area, and in other areas, may meet with the same fate.  We 
are proud of our religion, and feel that we have as much right to 
follow our beliefs openly as anyone else does.  We do not ask others to 
believe as we do--each person must walk their own path--but we do ask--
no, insist--that we be allowed to walk our path with dignity and in 
sunlight, not in shadows.  We are beginning to wonder if these 
incidences of persecution (of us and other groups, and the Helms bill) 
at this time could be part of some gigantic game plan. Perhaps the Lord 
and Lady are tired of being hidden away in basements, back rooms, 
garages, and secret places, and have decided that it is time to claim 
Their Place in the Sun.  And only we, Their sons and daughters, can 
bring them out of the shadows and into the Sunlight.  Going public and 
fighting this injustice was not an easy decision to make, for we all 
have much to lose--jobs, families, friends. But, someone, somewhere, 
must make a stand--this time it is our turn. Others have done it before 
us, we know others will have to do it again in the future, but each 
time one of us wins a small skirmish, we altar the pattern of the 
future.  As several people have reminded us, all religions have gone 
through a period of persecution.  Those who perservered, who stood up 
for their rights and religion, found acceptance.  Where would the 
Baptists, Methodists, Mormons, Catholics and other major faiths be 
today if they had hidden in the shadows?  Should we be less strong than 
they?  It is our dream that someday our children can walk proudly, 
without fear, in the light of the Sun, to their Circle site.  That's 
why we are determined to see this through, as far as we can take it--
for ourselves, for our brothers and sisters of the Craft, and for the 
future of all Pagans and Wiccans, wherever they may be.

     To all of you, again, our sincere thanks for the support and 
encouragement you are giving us in our struggle.

Brightest blessings!

Lady Galadriel, Lord Athanor, Lady Rhea
