                    CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
           copyright 1984 W. J. Bethancourt III 
             recorded: CELTIC CIRCLE DANCE 
                       WTP-0002 
           tune: Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat 
 
    Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 
    once I talked to a great Grey Man 
    spun three times and said with a sigh 
    "Hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!" 
 
 Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 
        hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 
        hi di diddle i diddle i day 
        fol the dink a dum diddle do di day 
 
    Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 
    prettiest thing I've ever seen 
    she went down underneath the hill 
    and came back out of her own free will 
 
    Brian Boru, on Irish ground 
    walked three times the Island round 
    Norsemen came lookin for a fight 
    just another Irish Saturday night! 
 
    Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 
    a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 
    a harper and a warrior and none the least: 
    a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 
 
    Harold Haardrada's face was red! 
    Came to Britain and he wound up dead 
    Stamford Bridge is where he's found 
    got six feet of English ground 
 
    the Legion with it's Eagles bright 
    marched into the Pictish night 
    met them there upon the sand 
    gave em up to the Wicker Man! 
 
    eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 
    the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 
    fire burn and fire spark 
    are you then feared of the dark? 
 
    The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
    the Circle goes where no man knows 
    Hail to the Lady, one in three: 
    Present is Past and Past is Me! 
 
    Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 
    all thru the Day all thru the Night 
    Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
    Present is Past and Past is Thee! 
 
    Hi said the Lady dressed in white 
    sang the Day and sang the Night 
    sang the Land and sang the Sea 
    sang the Song, and then sang Me!    (extra verses:) 
 
    Salt and oil and mirror bright 
    fire and fleet and candlelight 
    by fin and feather, leaf and tree, 
    fill the cup and blessed be! 
 
    From the misty crystal sea 
    came the Lady to the lea 
    Sword and Roses in Her Hand 
    spread their seeds thruout the Land 
 
    Came the Stag from oaken wood 
    saw the Lady where she stood 
    by the fire burning bright 
    came to know his heart's delight!    (end of extra verses) 
 
    By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound 
    Blessed Be: the Day I've found 
    Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
    Present is Past and Past is WE 
 
    By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn 
    blessed be the Day you're born! 
    Fire burn and fire bright 
    walk in safety thru the night 
 
                             * end *
