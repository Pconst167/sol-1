                   AN ECLECTIC CIRCLE CEREMONY
                    Durwydd MacTara, 1989-90
     PART ONE:
                          Preliminaries

WATER :

     Blessings upon thee, O creature of water, I cast out from
thee all impurities and uncleanness of the spirits  of phantasm,
confusion, or any other influence not for the free will of all.

SALT :

     Blessings be upon this creature of salt; let all malignity
and hindrance be cast forth thencefrom, and let all good enter
therein.  Wherefore I bless thee and invoke thee, that thou
mayest aid me.

MIXING :

     I take this salt of the Earth, Blessed with the will of
     Fire; I take this water of spirit,Exorcised with mind of
merit;

     I mix them with words of power, Dedicated to every Tower.

     By the power of moon and sun,
     By the power of Spirit,earth and sea,
     God and Goddess are part of One,
     As I Will, so mote it be!

                      CASTING OF THE CIRCLE

     I conjure thee, O circle of power,
     As thou encircle every Tower.
     That thou beest a place of Truth, Joy and love,
     Encircling Flight of Eagle, Hawk and Dove.
     Mighty Aegis of the Lady and Lord,
     Rampart of thought, action and word.
     To work in Peace, Powerful and Free,
     Who walk between two worlds conjure thee;
     A boundary to Protect, Concentrate and Contain,
     That Power raised here be not in vain.

Wherefore do I bless thee and consecrate thee, in the names of
Cernunnos and Aradia.
