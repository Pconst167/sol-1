                        Making Tools


    It is an old belief that the best substances for making tools are those 
    that once had life in them, as opposed to artificial substances. Thus, 
    wood or ivory is better for a wand than metal, which is more 
    appropriate for swords or knives. Virgin parchment is better than 
    manufactured paper for talismans, etc.  And things which have been made 
    by hand are good, because there is life in them.
