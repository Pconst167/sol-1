                        Cone of Power

HP leads a ring dance deosil about HPS who stands in the center.
Coveners are arranged man and woman alternately, facing inwards and holding 
hands (left plams up, right palms down). All dance and chant either the 
Witches' Rune or the call of the ancient Mysteries:

All:    "Eo, Evohe !"

Dance and chant faster and faster until HPS senses that the time is right,
whereupon she calls:

HPS:    "Down !"

All shall drop to the ground in a circle facing the HPS. If there is coven 
work to be done, now is the appropriate time to do it. Or a meditation upon the 
Moon's season, or such other matter as may be fitting or needful. At an esbat 
Wine and Cakes will follow, but at a Sabbat the Great Rite comes first.
