Inanna Adoration by Mace Sylvan
-------------------------------
Our Lady of the Moon
The skies' silver wheel
Beauty in the highest
The Goddess, Inanna!

Her SIlvery sheen
Is the hunter's torch
As he follows Her
Across the night sky.

Our Lady of the Moon
The beauty of the night
The skies' silver jewel
Is her royal orb!

Tell me, my lady
How can I make
My inner-light
Shine as bright as you?

If it's just love
Then I know how
Because the Moon
Is always Loved!

Our Lady of the moon
The skies silver wheel
Beauty in the highest
The Goddess, Inanna!


[Meant for use in a moon ritual, preferably full phase]




Asahi  by C.J.
--------------
(asahi [ausa-he] is japanese; asa-morning, hi-fire)

Asahi, the morning fire,
rise oh body, for my soul to spire.
Gyrations of another day,
never ending, always flowing,
the dance we call creation.
Centered is the one who seeks,
for intution is always knowing,
so I call upon the "Asahi"
to keep the sparkle glowing.
Asahi, morning fire,
Creator of new life,
balancing the course of nature,
oh heal me of my strike.
Warrior, flow through me,
for it is strength that I desire.
Walk with me, this troubled day,
so that with peace,
I may retire.



Bright Blessings   by Gina T. Ranney
------------------------------------
Earth Mother
Giver of life
Strengthen me during my life-long
strife.
Teach me your ways of perfect love,
peace, and wisdom true.
Spawn from my purest heart
These words to you
May this prayer help me to better
myself in word and deed,
To a higher plane I shall succeed.
Beautiful light of goodness fair
Lore of old we both do share
A Witch's brew, I drink to you
My love for you, by day, by night
In thought and in sight
Will my soul learn
the meaning of this life
again.


Triple Goddess Invocation  by Mace Sylvan
-----------------------------------------
The waxing moon
is the maiden's sign

The full moon's
the mark of the mother

The waning moon
is the crone's symbol

The dark moon
is a Goddess unknown

Please, let love
be (with me/amoung us) now

For our Goddess
is pure LOVE

[Use as part of a meditation or as a begining in a triple goddess ritual]


Invocation of Diana   by Gray Wolf
----------------------------------
Oak, Ash and Thorn
Happy are we to be born,
In this time of Earth reborn,
We invoke you on this morn.
Goddess of the fields and trees,
We your children want to please,
To your pleasures we appease,
We will pay your homage fees.
Come to us and bless our love,
You who know the powers above,
Show yourself to those who want you,
We worship you in mist and dew.
Appear.

Handfasting Prayer   by Larkspur
--------------------------------
"Marry me under a garland of stars,
Conifers silent witness
To night wind's echoed vows.
Bearing our promises upward
Through universal whiteness
To the sepulchre of God.
Touch me once for all time,
All lives that are to be...
Our love enshrined.
Marry me under the gaze of stars.
Celestial concourse, bless our joy
Now and forevermore..."


THE WIND IS SIGHING  by Nyko
----------------------------

The wind is sighing thru the trees
And Night has drawn her velvet cloak
Jove's heaven sparkles high above
And Juno sails her lovely boat

I am here and all is now
The candle patiently awaits the flame
All thoughts are stilled, all tensions
gone

No cares for this life's hectic game

A part of all that is I am
A spark within the light divine
All that I need I have within
I carry with me all the time

Bright Lord and Lady of abundance
Spread your protection round this place
As I weave my magic, gently, softly
Smile upon this private space.

BLESSING by M. Flanders
-----------------------
May the East fling open your windows,
and fill your rooms with air;
May the South send you strong sunshine,
and give you the strength to dare;
May the west wash rivers into your
heart, and oceans into your soul,
May the North share the secrets and
gifts of the earth,
to heal and make you whole.
