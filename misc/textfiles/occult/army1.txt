Excerpts from Department of the Army Pamphlet 165-13

RELIGIOUS REQUIREMENTS AND PRACTICES OF CERTAIN SELECTED GROUPS

A HANDBOOK FOR CHAPLAINS

Headquarters, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., dated 28 April 1978



The following is an excerpt from the handbook that I think would be of  interest 
to  the  'other' religions as the army puts it.  I hope that it can be  of  some 
benefit  and  that  none take offense to it.  As stated, it is  an  excerpt  and 
typed  verbatim.   A complete copy of the book (price unknown) can  be  obtained 
from:

In  the  handbook,  there  are seven main  sections,  being  Christain  Heritage 
Groups, Indian Heritage Groups, Islamic Groups, Japanese Heritage Groups, Jewish 
Groups, Sikh Groups and 'Other' Groups.

This paper will deal exclusively with the 'Other' Groups, and more specifically, 
the  'Old' religions.  This category is broken down into:  American  Council  of 
Witches,  Baha'i Faith, Church of Satan, Churches of  Sciencetology,  Foundation 
Faith of the Millenium, Gardinerian Wicca, Native American Church and  Universal 
Life Church.

                         INTRODUCTION:  'OTHER' GROUPS

The  groups  considered in this section manifest the wide variety  of  religious 
options  available  in  the  U.S.  They draw  upon  several  distinct  religious 
impulses, each with a long heritage.

MAGICK

Magick  (not  magic,  which  is considered a stage  performers  art  and  not  a 
religion)  groups have experienced considerable growth since the 1960's.   These 
groups  are  distinguished  by  their use of  occult  practices  (astrology  and 
divination)   and  magick  (the  ability  to  willfully  change  the  world   by 
manipulating the cosmic forces).  While like the psychic dimension, magick is as 
old  as known history.  It's contemporary revival, however, began in  the  early 
1900's.

The  most  popular  form  of magick is witchcraft.   Not  to  be  confused  with 
Satanism,  witchcraft is a nature-oriented religion based on the worship of  the 
male-female  polarity, the observance of the agricultural seasons,  and  magick.  
Worship of the male-female aspects of nature usually expressed as allegiance  to 
the Horned God and the Great Mother Goddess.  Ritual follows the movement of the 
sun and moon.


Magick  seeks  mastery of all the cosmic forces believed to control  the  world.  
Witches  believe in the ancient principle of 'as above, so below', and in  their 
worship seek to create a microcosm, a magical image of the whole.  The  universe 
is generally viewed as a sphere.  The magical circle, drawn at the beginning  of 
all magical rituals, is the outline of the microcosm intersecting the floor.

Witchcraft  had  grown slowly until the repeal of the last  of  England's  anti-
witchcraft  laws  in the 1950's.  Growth accelerated in the 1960's  and  1970's.  
There  are no less than thirty different witch (or the preferred  term  'Wicca') 
groups  plus numerous independent covens functioning in the U.S.   The  American 
Council  of  Witches  represents the traditionalist  covens  which  trace  their 
ancestry  to various medievel European traditions.  The Gardnerians are  one  of 
several  modern Wicca groups.  Others are the Alexandrians, the Algard, and  the 
Church  of  Wicca  of Bakersfield (CA).  There are  also  several  miscellaneous 
traditions.

Secrecy  is  a major element of the existence of both witchcraft  and  Satanism.  
Secrecy is protective and serves to guard the sacred mysteries of the group.

***The following excerpts are condensed, otherwise I would be typing out a whole 
book.

GARDNERIAN WICCA          

HISTORICAL  ROOTS:   Founded by Gerald Gardner in 1954 due in part to  the  book 
'Witchcraft Today'.

ORIGINS IN THE U.S.:  Brought to the U.S. by Lady Rowen from England in 1962.

NUMBER OF ADHERENTS IN THE U.S.:  Unknown.  Between 2,500 and 5,000.   

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE:  The basic structure is the coven with 5 to 50 members 
(ideally 12-15) led by a High Priestess or High Priest.

LEADERSHIP:  The High Priestess or High Priest has authority for the coven.

WHO MAY CONDUCT SERVICES:  Only the High Priestess can cast a circle.

IS  GROUP  WORSHIP REQUIRED:  Yes, but individual worship is  possible  but  not 
encouraged.

WORSHIP  REQUIREMENTS:   Covens  meet weekly or bi-weekly (at the  full  or  new 
moon), always in the evening.  Worship in some (but not all) groups occur in the 
nude.

MINIMUM  EQUIPMENT  FOR WORSHIP:  The 'atheme,' a bowl of water, a  censer  with 
incense,  salt, an altar and 6 candles in candlesticks.  The 'pentacle,'  and  a 
sword are optional.  All tools must be ritually consecrated by a High Priestess.

SPECIAL  HOLIDAYS:  Spring Equinox, March 21; Summer Solstice, June  22;  Autumn 
Equinox,  September  21; Winter Solstice, December 22;  Candlemas,  February  2, 
Beltane,  April  30; Lammas, July31; and Halloween, October 31.   Besides  these 
eight,  most groups meet either weekly or bi-weekly (on the full and new  moon).  
Major holidays are termed sabbats, and weekly or bi-weekly mettings are esbats.



FUNERAL  AND  BURIAL REQUIREMENTS:  Practices vary widely but  notify  coven  to 
which  associated.   Ritual tools or materials found among the  remains  of  the 
deceased should be immediately returned to the family or members of the coven.

IS  A  PRIESTESS  OR  PRIEST REQUIRED AT TIME OF DEATH:  No,  but  it  would  be 
permissable  for  any Chaplain to offer spiritual comfort at such  times.   Upon 
death,  a  prayer may be directed to GOD for the release of the  soul  from  the 
Earth plane, separate and apart from any ritual work done by the member's coven.
 
BASIC TEACHINGS OR BELIEFS:  Gardnerians worship the Mother Goddess and also the 
Horned  God,  symbols of the basic polarity of all nature.   They  seek  balance 
within nature, within themselves, and between male and female.

CREEDAL STATEMENTS:  'The Book of Shadows' is authoriative.

ETHICAL PRACTICES:  'An Ye Harm None, Do As Ye Will.'

RELATIONSHIP  WITH  OTHER  RELIGIONS:   Wicca  is  open  toward  other   faiths, 
recognizing  that the Great Mother appears in these faiths under various  names.  
Because  of the persecutions of past years, Wiccans take a guarded  relation  to 
groups  which  claim to possess 'the Truth' or to be the 'Only Way.'   Wicca  is 
only  one path among many, and is not for everyone.  Members are  encouraged  to 
learn about other faiths and attend services, should they desire to do so.

***  Well, there you have it.  A nutshell version of how the Army looks  at  and 
tell's  it members about 'Other' religions.  I would order the book just to  see 
how it describes some contemporary religions versus other religions.
