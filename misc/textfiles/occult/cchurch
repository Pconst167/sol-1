        I'd like to take a moment to tell you about a unique network.
It's called the CyberChurch Fellowship(tm).  It is an echomail network
for Christians, or persons interested in finding their own relationship
with Jesus Christ, and it is dedicated to the positive promotion of unity
in the Brotherhood of Christ.  Here's some information:

              CyberChurch Fellowship(tm) Echomail Network

CyberChurch Fellowship(tm) was founded in 1993 by Joel Davenport, of
Chattanooga, Tennessee.  It first appeared on The Fountain BBS.

CyberChurch Fellowship(tm) was designed with the intention of providing
spiritually-minded users with a fellowship of discussion and
information on religious topics.  There is no single denominational
affiliation in CyberChurch Fellowship(tm), and all who accept the Bible as
the Word of God and Jesus Christ as His Son, and our Saviour, are
welcome to join the network.

The CyberChurch Fellowship(tm) Mission:    To create a spirit of unity and
love in the brotherhood of believers in Jesus Christ and to advocate the
fertilization of GOOD FRUIT in the Kingdom of our Lord.

In January, 1994, CyberChurch Fellowship(tm) made its complete debut
on the electronic frontier.  We currently have nodes in Tennessee, Kentucky,
South Carolina, Nebraska, Colorado, California, Canada, Florida, New York,
Wisconsin and Virginia, and we'd love to have YOU be a part of our
fellowship.  If you are interested in joining in, please let me know
(information on how to contact me follows).  If you'd like to be a member
of the fellowship without being a state host, that's fine, too.  You'll
find that we're really flexible.

* We've now gone INTERNATIONAL, too!  With nodes in Belgium!

The echomail network rules can be summed up in this, although specific
requests are included in the monthly posting of rules and information:

   1.  Love Jehovah God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength.
            If you do this, I believe that it will cover a multitude
            of sins.  If you're acting out of love for God, then you
            won't want to do anything in this fellowship that would
            harm Him.

   2.  Love your neighbor as yourself.
            I believe that this covers the rest.  If you're acting out of
            love for your fellow man, you won't flame him, curse him,
            or in any other way want to harm him.  Rather, you will treat
            everyone else with the same respect that you expect from
            yourself.

Note:   All echos allow AKA's or Handles.  Just please do not allow
Anonymous posts in them.  Thanks...

Ideas for new echos?  Simply submit them.  The general guideline I use
is this:  If it's a Christian-based topic, or of interest to Christians
in general, I'll usually add it.

If you, or a user on your system, are interested in becoming a moderator
for any of the echos currently in need of a moderator, please send me
a private message and include what your guidelines would be for the echo,
as well as the information you would want posted automatically every month
concerning the echo.  I will try to handle any such request quickly.

If you are interested in joining in our fellowship, please send me a netmail
message, or call me VOICE.  I can be reached by any of the following:
